Plant matter & Fish Teeth have been found here.]]\nThe Ciechocinek is composed mostly by muds and silts, along with poorly consolidated [[Mudstone]]s and [[Siltstone]]s with lenses and subordinate intercalations of fine-grained sandy lenses, typically from 1 mm to less 20 cm thick, extended a few meters, along also with sandstones. Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization \nof Siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by mixture of un de termined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siedrites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the deacay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleous of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to thepure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are from rare o extremely rare. Mudstones are porrly consolidated, tren to disintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range froma wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand, there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates for be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Cz\u00eastochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\n[[File:Wapienno - kamienio\u0142omy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation.]]\nDeposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being  deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>  The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave dominated [[Sandy Shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominat sedimentation was by quiet [[Mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P.

Acta Geologica Polonica, 61(2), 215-241.</ref> There is a detailed succession of changes in the strata with time, where the location of the river mouths shifted because of effects such as the progradation of deltas, the stop of the flux of river channels and the long-lasting esutatic sea-level changes, all of that can be confirmed by the presence of microstructures as result of erosion and cross lamination in the mud-silt facies.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> A [[Marine Transgression]] correlated to the rise of the sea level on the Lower Toarcian is crearly visible on the [[Silesian-Cracow]] area, where the sea encroached the [[Polish Trough]], which resulted in the end of the [[Pliensbachian]] alluvial sedimentation, that can be observed on the underliying [[Blanowice Formation]]. The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to Floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers \nis observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continue on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, impliying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Mostly of the Invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from this layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a paulatine alluvial progradation.

Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization \nof Siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by mixture of un de termined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siedrites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the deacay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleous of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to thepure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are from rare o extremely rare. Mudstones are porrly consolidated, tren to disintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range froma wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand, there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline.

The home station of the brigade is in [[Calgary]].\n\nThe brigade has an establishment of 2,500 all ranks.  The role of the [[Primary Reserve#Army_Reserve|Army Reserve]] is to be \"a professional part-time force that provides local engagement and a responsive integrated capability, at home or abroad, in sustainment of the Army mission.\"  Most of the soldiers within the brigade serve part time in units or sub-units stationed in their communities.  As the [[Canadian Army]] generates task-specific units for employment on expeditionary and domestic operations under the command of the [[Canadian Joint Operations Command]], 41&nbsp;CBG, as a force generator, is tasked with the following:\n\n# On order provide general-purpose, combat-capable soldiers and specialist sub-subunits (troops or platoons) capable of augmenting the Regular Force on expeditionary operations; and\n# On order provide a domestic response unit (territorial battalion group) or subunits (squadrons or companies) capable of augmenting the Regular Force on domestic operations.\n\n==Corporate Identity==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:41 CBG Camp Flag.png|Brigade Camp Flag\nFile:41 CBG Comd Pennant.jpg|Commander's Pennant\nFile:41 CBG Logo.jpg|Brigade Logo\nFile:41 CBG Brigade Tie.jpg|Brigade Necktie\nFile:41 CBG Brand.jpg|Brigade Brand\n</gallery>\n\n==Brigade Units==\n#'''Brigade Headquarters''' ([[Calgary]])\n#'''[[The South Alberta Light Horse]]'''\n#*Regimental Headquarters ([[Medicine Hat]])\n#*A Squadron ([[Medicine Hat]] and [[Lethbridge]])\n#*B Squadron ([[Edmonton]])\n#*Headquarters Squadron ([[Medicine Hat]] and [[Edmonton]])\n#'''[[The King's Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC)]]'''\n#*Regimental Headquarters ([[Calgary]])\n#*A Squadron ([[Calgary]])\n#*B Squadron ([[Calgary]])\n#*Headquarters Squadron ([[Calgary]])\n#'''20<sup>th</sup> Field Regiment, RCA'''\n#*Regimental Headquarters ([[Edmonton]])\n#*61<sup>st</sup> Field Battery ([[Edmonton]])\n#*78<sup>th</sup> Field Battery ([[Red Deer]])\n#*Headquarters Battery ([[Edmonton]] and [[Red Deer]])\n#'''20<sup>th</sup> Independent Field Battery, RCA''' ([[Lethbridge]])\n#'''[[41 Combat Engineer Regiment]], RCE'''\n#*Regimental Headquarters ([[Edmonton]]) \n#*25 Engineer Squadron ([[Edmonton]])\n#*33 Engineer Squadron ([[Calgary]])\n#*Headquarters Squadron ([[Edmonton]] and [[Calgary]])\n#'''[[41 Signal Regiment]], RC Sigs'''\n#*Regimental Headquarters ([[Edmonton]])\n#*1 Signal Squadron ([[Edmonton]])\n#*2 Signal Squadron ([[Red Deer]])\n#*3 Signal Squadron ([[Calgary]])\n#*Headquarters Squadron ([[Edmonton]], [[Red Deer]], [[Calgary]])\n#'''[[The Loyal Edmonton Regiment]]'''\n#*Battalion Headquarters ([[Edmonton]])\n#*A Company ([[Edmonton]])\n#*B Company ([[Edmonton]])\n#*C Company ([[Yellowknife]])\n#*Headquarters Company ([[Edmonton]])\n#'''[[The Calgary Highlanders]]'''\n#*Battalion Headquarters ([[Calgary]])\n#*A Company ([[Calgary]])\n#*B Company ([[Calgary]])\n#*Headquarters Company ([[Calgary]])\n#'''[[41 Service Battalion]]'''\n#*Battalion Headquarters ([[Calgary]])\n#*14 Service Company ([[Calgary]])\n#*15 Service Company ([[Edmonton]])\n#*Headquarters Company ([[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]])\n#'''[[15 (Edmonton) Field Ambulance]]''' ([[Edmonton]] and [[Calgary]])\n#*attached to 41 Canadian Brigade Group under Operational Control from 1 Health Services Group\n\n==History==\nThere are two constants in the organization of the institution that is the [[Canadian Army]], the \"Army Headquarters\" and the \"Units\".

It is owned by [[NYC Health + Hospitals]], a [[public benefit corporation]] of the city. The hospital is home to FDNY-EMS Station 43, formerly NYC-EMS Station 31.\n\nThe hospital was renamed in November 2015 as a reflection of its parent organization's rebranding.<ref name=\"rename\">{{cite news |last=Gamble |first=Molly |newspaper=Becker's Hospital Review |publisher=Becker's Healthcare |url=http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/a-new-name-for-nyc-health-and-hospitals-corp-5-things-to-know.html |title=A new name for NYC Health and Hospitals Corp.: 5 things to know |date=November 10, 2015 |accessdate=December 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1875, Coney Island Hospital began as a [[first aid]] station on the oceanfront beach near West Third Street. Most cases were feet cut by broken bottles.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n  \nOn May 12, 1902, a small wooden building, one and one half stories high, on Sea Breeze Avenue, was rented to serve as an emergency hospital during the summer months.  It was called the '''Sea Breeze Hospital''' but officially known as '''Reception Hospital''', an annex of the [[Kings County Hospital]].  It had 20 beds and facilities for emergency treatment.  Patients requiring more were taken to Kings County Hospital, about seven miles away, in a horse-drawn ambulance.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n  \nRapid population growth in southern Brooklyn called for a large and permanent hospital. In 1908, construction of a 100-bed hospital was started, north of [[Coney Island Creek]] and east of [[Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn)|Ocean Parkway]]. With the help of [[Robert W. Hebberd]], Coney Island Hospital was dedicated on May 18, 1910, then a six-building complex.<ref name=\"Hibberd\">{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1928/11/25/91729703.pdf |title=R.W.

Although not native habitat for the elk, they thrived. In the same year, the state put a small herd at [[Cache Creek (Sacramento River)|Cache Creek]]. This herd has not fared well due to poor range conditions. This herd may have interbred with the Rocky Mountain elk which were introduced near [[Mount Shasta]].\n\nIn 1960, the state held a hearing in Owens Valley to determine how many elk should be allowed to live there. They decided the elk should be hunted to limit their numbers to under 500 animals. Through efforts of the California Department of Fish and Game, three permanent elk herds were established in California. By 1969, the Tupman State Reserve (32), Cache Creek (80) and Owens Valley, Inyo County (300 elk) were in place.\n\nA private citizen from Los Angeles, Beula Edmiston, formed a group to attempt a preservation program for the elk. After more than 10 years of lobbying both on the federal and state levels, in 1971, California passed legislation (the Behr bill) requiring the elk may not be hunted until their numbers surpass 2,000 head statewide or until it could be determined that suitable elk habitat no longer existed in the state, and mandated the California Department of Resources to reintroduce the elk into former habitats wherever possible.\n\nIn 1976, the US Congress passed a resolution which stated 2000 tule elk is an appropriate national goal, and directed federal agencies to make federal lands available for preservation of tule elk.<ref>The Tule Elk in California, Bureau of Land Management, PL 94 389 March 1980</ref> An Interagency Task Force<ref>A Management Plan for the Conservation of Tule Elk, The Tule Elk Interagency Task Force, June 1979</ref> of representatives from the National Park Service, US Forest Service, the Armed Forces, Bureau of Land Management, California Department of Parks and Recreation, and the California Department of Fish and Game<ref>Tule elk in California-report to the legislature, May 1978, Resources Agency, Dept. of Fish and Game</ref> selected sites for the reintroduction of tule elk within the state.

Although not native habitat for the elk, they thrived. In the same year, the state put a small herd at [[Cache Creek (Sacramento River)|Cache Creek]]. This herd has not fared well due to poor range conditions. This herd may have interbred with the Rocky Mountain elk which were introduced near [[Mount Shasta]].\n\nIn 1960, the state held a hearing in Owens Valley to determine how many elk should be allowed to live there. They decided the elk should be hunted to limit their numbers to under 500 animals. Through efforts of the California Department of Fish and Game, three permanent elk herds were established in California. By 1969, the Tupman State Reserve (32), Cache Creek (80) and Owens Valley, Inyo County (300 elk) were in place.\n\nA private citizen from Los Angeles, Beula Edmiston, formed a group to attempt a preservation program for the elk. After more than 10 years of lobbying both on the federal and state levels, in 1971, California passed legislation (the Behr bill) requiring the elk may not be hunted until their numbers surpass 2,000 head statewide or until it could be determined that suitable elk habitat no longer existed in the state, and mandated the California Department of Resources to reintroduce the elk into former habitats wherever possible.\n\nIn 1976, the US Congress passed a resolution which stated 2000 tule elk is an appropriate national goal, and directed federal agencies to make federal lands available for preservation of tule elk.<ref>The Tule Elk in California, Bureau of Land Management, PL 94 389 March 1980</ref> An Interagency Task Force<ref>A Management Plan for the Conservation of Tule Elk, The Tule Elk Interagency Task Force, June 1979</ref> of representatives from the National Park Service, US Forest Service, the Armed Forces, Bureau of Land Management, California Department of Parks and Recreation, and the California Department of Fish and Game<ref>Tule elk in California-report to the legislature, May 1978, Resources Agency, Dept. of Fish and Game</ref> selected sites for the reintroduction of tule elk within the state.
