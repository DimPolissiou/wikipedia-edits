In 1990, the Honolulu Museum of Art School was opened to expand the program of studio art classes and workshops. In 2001, the [[Henry R. Luce]] Pavilion Complex opened with the Honolulu Museum of Art Caf\u00e9, Museum Shop, and Henry R. Luce Wing with {{convert|8000|sqft|m2}} of gallery space.\n\n===Collections and holdings===\n[[File:Mrs Thomas Lincoln Manson Jr by John Singer Sargent.jpg|thumb|left|''Mrs. Thomas Lincoln Manson Jr'' (Mary Groot) 1890, by [[John Singer Sargent]].

Admission is free to members, children and for some events, but otherwise a fee is charged. Some events and certain days offer free admission to all.\nGuided tours are offered several times daily. Tours in the [[Japanese language]], for the hearing impaired and specialty group tours for 10 or more are also available.\n\n===Hours===\nThe museum is open from 10 a.m. to 4:30&nbsp;p.m.  from Tuesday to Sunday. Closed on Monday.\n\n===Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House===\n{{main|Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House}}\nThe museum's second location, [[Spalding House]] (formerly The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu), is located in [[Makiki Heights]] and includes galleries, a caf\u00e9, and a sculpture garden. On permanent view is [[David Hockney|David Hockney's]] installation \"[[L'enfant et les sortil\u00e8ges]],\" the artist's interpretation of his original stage designs for the 1981 [[Metropolitan Opera]] production.\n\n===Doris Duke Theatre===\nThe [[Doris Duke]] Theatre at the museum seats 280. It hosts movies, concerts, lectures, and presentations. The theatre is also home to Hawaii's [[GLBT]] film festival the [[Rainbow Film Festival]]. It is currently run by Theatre Manager, Taylour Chang.\n\n===Robert Allerton Art Library===\nIn 1927, the Research Library opened with 500 books. In 1955, it was expanded and named for [[Robert Allerton|Robert Allerto]]n. The collection includes 45,000 books and periodicals, biographical files on artists, and auction catalogues dating to the beginning of the 20th century. The museum has over 8,000 woodblock prints, many of which were gifts from [[James A. Michener]]. More than 2,000 Japanese ukiyo-e prints are digitized and available for viewing online. The library is a non-circulating research facility. The library reading room is open on Wednesdays.\n\n===Honolulu Museum of Art School===\n{{main|Honolulu Museum of Art School}}\nArts education is another facet of the museum. The Honolulu Museum of Art School (formerly the Academy Art Center at Linekona) offers studio art classes and workshops, and hosts exhibitions showcasing the island's folk and contemporary artists. The school offers arts education programs for children with special needs and public school students and maintains a lending collection for educators, students, and community groups.\n\n===Shangri La: Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art===\n{{main|Shangri La (Doris Duke)|Doris Duke}}\n\n[[Doris Duke]] (1912\u20131993) built Shangri La with the help of American architect [[Marion Sims Wyeth]]. Duke's collection of Islamic art was assembled over 60 years.\n\n==History==\n[[Anna Rice Cooke]] (1853\u20131934), daughter of New England missionaries and founder of the Honolulu Museum of Art, in her dedication statement at the opening of the museum on April 8, 1927 said:\n<blockquote>\"That our children of many nationalities and races, born far from the centers of art, may receive an intimation of their own cultural legacy and wake to the ideals embodied in the arts of their neighbors ... that Hawaiians, Americans, Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos, Northern Europeans and all other people living here, contacting through the channel of art those deep intuitions common to all, may perceive a foundation on which a new culture, enriched by the old strains may be built in the islands.\"&nbsp;&mdash;''[[Anna Rice Cooke]]''<ref name=\"Ellis, George R. 1990, p.10\">Ellis, George R., ''Honolulu Academy of Arts, Selected Works'', Honolulu, Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1990, p.10</ref></blockquote>Born on [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] in 1853, Cooke grew up on [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i island]] in a home that appreciated the arts. In 1874, she married [[Charles Montague Cooke]] and the two eventually settled in Honolulu.  In 1882, they built a home on Beretania Street, across from [[Thomas Square]]. As Cooke's career prospered, they gathered their private art collection.  First were \"parlor pieces\" for their home.  She frequented the shop of furniture maker Yeun Kwock Fong Inn who often had ceramics and textile pieces sent from his brother in China.\n\nThe Cookes\u2019 art collection outgrew their home and the homes of their children. In 1920, she and her daughter Alice (Mrs. Phillip Spalding), her daughter-in-law Dagmar (Mrs. Richard Cooke), and [[Catharine Elizabeth Bean Cox|Catharine E. B. Cox]] (Mrs. Isaac Cox), an art and drama teacher, began to catalogue and research the collection with the intent to display the items in a museum.   \nWith little formal training, these women obtained a charter for the museum from the [[Territory of Hawaii]] in 1922, while continuing to catalogue the collection. Cooke wanted a museum that reflected Hawai{{okina}}i's multi-cultural make-up. Not bound by the traditional western idea of art museums, she also wanted to showcase the island's climate in an open and airy environment, using courtyards which interconnect the galleries throughout the museum.\n\nThe Cookes donated their Beretania Street land along with an endowment of $25,000.  Their home was torn down to make way for the museum. New York architect [[Bertram Goodhue]] designed a classic Hawaiian-style building with simple off-white exteriors and tiled roofs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gurewitsch|first=Matthew|title=A Hawaiian Grand Tour|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=December 26, 2013|page=D5}}</ref>   Goodhue died before the project was completed; it was finished by [[Mayers Murray & Phillip|Hardie Phillip]]. This style has been imitated in many buildings throughout the state.\n\nOn April 8, 1927, the Honolulu Museum of Art opened.  There was a traditional Hawaiian blessing and the [[Royal Hawaiian Band]], under the direction of [[Henri Berger]], played at festivities. With the opening of the museum came gifts of many pieces, sometimes even entire collections. Additions to the original building include a library (1956), an education wing (1960), a gift shop (1965), a cafe (1969), a contemporary gallery, administrative offices and 292-seat theater (1977), and an art center for studio classes and expanded educational programming (1989).  In 1999, the museum created a children's interactive gallery, lecture hall, and offices.<ref name=\"Ellis, George R. 1990, p.10\"/>\n\nThe original building was named Hawai{{okina}}i's best building by the Hawai{{okina}}i Chapter of the American Institute of Architecture and is registered as a National and State Historical site.  The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.\n\nIn 1998, extensive renovation began starting with the Asian wing. In September 1999, construction began on the John Hara-designed Henry R. Luce Pavilion Complex, which opened May 13, 2001.  It includes expanded spaces for The Pavilion Caf\u00e9 and The Museum Shop and a new two-story exhibition structure. The Luce Complex is named for [[Henry R. Luce]], the co-founder and editor of [[Time Magazine]] and other publications. His widow, [[Clare Boothe Luce]], had a residence in Hawai{{okina}}i and served on the museum's board of trustees from 1972&ndash;1977.\n[[File:Shakyamuni and the Eight Great Bodhisattvas, Korea, Chos\u00f4n Dynasty, 16th Cent., ink, color & gold on silk.jpg|thumb|[[Gautama Buddha]] and the Eight Great [[Bodhisattva]]s, Korea, [[Joseon Dynasty]], 16th century]]\nNew galleries exploring cross-cultural influences, were renovated and re-opened in the Western Wing in November 1999. A new gallery for [[Korean art]] was opened in June 2001.  New galleries for the arts of India, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia were renovated and opened in January 2002. A new gallery for the art of the Philippines named for retiring Museum Director and his wife, George and Nancy Ellis, opened in 2003.  In February 2005, the museum opened an Asian Painting Conservation Studio and in December 2005, completed renovation of the Western Art galleries.\n\nIn 2001, the museum entered into a partnership with the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art and the theater was refurbished and renamed for her in July 2002. In October 2002, the museum opened a new gallery that serves as the orientation center for all tours to Doris Duke's Honolulu estate Shangri La, which started on November 6, 2002.\n\nDue to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Hawaii|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] the museum laid off one third of its full-time workers & every seasonal worker that worked part time to reduce the spread of [[COVID-19]] on April 17, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/04/17/breaking-news/honolulu-museum-of-art-lays-off-a-third-of-full-timers-all-part-timers-and-seasonal-help/|title=Honolulu Museum of Art lays off a third of full-timers, all part-timers and seasonal help| date=April 17, 2020|first1= Leila|last1=Fujimori |work=[[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]]}}</ref>\n\nThe museum's permanent collection grew to over 38,000 pieces with significant holdings in Asian art, American and European painting and decorative arts, 19th- and 20th-century art, an extensive collection of works on paper, Asian textiles, and traditional works from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas.\n\n\n\n=== The Contemporary Museum and Honolulu Academy of Arts Merge ===\nThe former [[Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House|Contemporary Museum, Honolulu]] in [[Makiki|Makiki Heights]] was integrated into the Honolulu Academy of Arts in July 2011. The Academy's board of trustees voted in December 2011 to change the museum's public name to the Honolulu Museum of Art as of March 2012, retaining its legal name as the Honolulu Academy of Arts. The former Contemporary Museum, or [[Spalding House]], became the Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House, the Art Center at Linekona became the [[Honolulu Museum of Art School]], and The Contemporary Museum at [[First Hawaiian Center]] became the Honolulu Museum of Art at First Hawaiian Center.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nakagawa|first1=Lynn|title=Honolulu Academy of Arts to be renamed Honolulu Museum of Art|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2011/12/07/honolulu-academy-of-arts-to-be-renamed.html|accessdate=19 June 2014|publisher=Pacific Business News|date=December 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Sale of Spalding House ===\nOn July 16, 2019, the museum announced that its board of trustees would be selling [[Spalding House]] in an effort to \"allow the museum to focus its resources on its main campus at Beretania Street.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/07/16/breaking-news/honolulu-museum-of-art-to-sell-historical-spalding-house-in-makiki/|title=Honolulu Museum of Art to sell historic Spalding House in Makiki|last=nwu@staradvertiser.com|first=By Nina Wu|last2=July 16|first2=2019|date=2019-07-16|website=Honolulu Star-Advertiser|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-04}}</ref>\n\nInterim director and trustee, Mark Burak, stated: \"From a fiduciary standpoint, we\u2019ve taken a very long and hard look at this from all angles. While the Spalding House property\u2019s beauty and historic significance make it hard to part with, it has also been challenging splitting our attention between two large, resource-intensive art campuses, one limited by several factors that have made it difficult to deliver the kind of quality art exhibitions, programs and services we have desired.\u201d\n\nTrustee and chairman of the Building and Grounds Committee, Jim Pearce, added: \"The committee concluded unanimously that it would be to the long-term benefit of HoMA to prepare [[Spalding House]] for sale. We are fortunate to have a board and employees who carefully evaluate all options for the future and are continually making changes to ensure that we maintain the solid financial footing necessary to fulfill our mission. Making and enabling this decision has been determined to represent good business practice for the long term.\u201d said Jim Pierce, trustee and chairman of the Building and Grounds Committee, in the release.\n\nFollowing these comments regarding the fiduciary responsibility of the Board, many community members speculated on well-being of the institution. In his editorial, [https://www.civilbeat.org/2019/07/sterling-higa-loss-of-spalding-house-a-reminder-old-money-alone-wont-sustain-the-arts/ Loss Of Spalding House A Reminder Old Money Alone Won\u2019t Sustain The Arts], Sterling Higa speculated on the financial history of the institution, wide spread urban development across Honolulu, and the arrival of new foreign investment. He writes: \"Our islands play host to out-of-state wealth. Japanese, Canadian and Chinese money pours in. Silicon Valley billionaires plant roots. Given the context, it seems likely that Spalding House will be sold to a foreign buyer, and the grounds will no longer be accessible to the general public. We can pray for salvation, but salvation may not come. Better to hope that the new oligarchy is as generous as the old oligarchy, which bequeathed us relics like Spalding House.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.civilbeat.org/2019/07/sterling-higa-loss-of-spalding-house-a-reminder-old-money-alone-wont-sustain-the-arts/|title=Sterling Higa: Loss Of Spalding House A Reminder Old Money Alone Won't Sustain The Arts|date=2019-07-26|website=Honolulu Civil Beat|language=en|access-date=2019-08-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Directors ===\n\n* [[Frank Montague Moore]] (1924\u20131927)\n* [[Catharine Elizabeth Bean Cox|Mrs. Isaac M.

Docents are trained to provide gallery tours for the Tea and Tour and Movie and Art Talk programs as well as educational activities such as Keiki-Parent Activity Tours and art experiences for seniors.\n\n===Tours===\nDocents conduct tours for the public, school groups (pre-school and up), and community organizations. Groups of ten or more persons and classes are requested to schedule tours at least two weeks in advance.\nIn a program called Tour and Tea, docents lead discussions in the galleries followed by iced tea in the courtyard.\nAn introductory tour called Treasures of the museum highlights selected works in the permanent collection.\n\nSpecial tours, focusing on temporary exhibitions often include supplementary materials and activities, some especially designed for children. Workshops and exhibition previews for teachers and other educators may also be offered.\nTheme tours concentrate on a specific country, region, time period, art movement, or groups of artists. Museum tours may be customized to correspond to the specific requirement of a class or group.\n\nA training program preparing volunteers to provide docent-guided tours is held only when needed. The four-semester course includes an overview of the museum's collections and programs and a survey of world art.   Docent Council meetings are conducted throughout the year along with continuing education of the museum collections and special training sessions for all major and traveling exhibitions.\n\n===Movie and Art Talk===\nArt documentaries are shown on selected Wednesday afternoons in the Education Lecture Hall.  Following the film, docents connect the film to the museum collection and continue with a discussion in the gallery.\n\n===Children===\nFamilies with children can pick up materials at the front desk.  Keiki Kit include booklets with stories to read, games and puzzles to solve, and a take-home activity.  Gallery Hunt Activity Sheets send the families through the galleries to find certain works of art that focus on a theme.  After reading a brief paragraph to learn about the work of art, and answering some questions, children win a prize.\n\nWorking with the [[Hawaii State Department of Education|Hawai{{okina}}i Department of Education]] and O{{okina}}ahu public schools, the museum provides art education programs for selected 5th graders and special education students.\n\nThe Ambassador program includes three parts. First, an Ambassador brings a museum-in-a-box to the classroom. Next, students tour appropriate galleries at the museum. Finally an Ambassador leads an art project in the classroom.  Ambassador Program themes include: East meets West, Hawai{{okina}}i and Its People, Art of the Philippines, Animals in Art, and Animals in Art for Special Education, Art of the Ancient World, and Art of the Pacific.\n\n===Other educational resources===\n[[File:Hemis (home dance) kachina, Arizona, Hopi people, Honolulu Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|''Hemis'' (home dance) [[Hopi Kachina dolls|kachina doll]], Arizona, [[Hopi people]] in the Honolulu Museum of Art]]\n\nThe museum's educational resources support educators, collectors, students, members, artists and art historians with a small library and a non-reservation collection.\n\n'''The Robert Allerton Art Research Library''' is open to college-level students, members, and other adults for art historical research.  It is a non-circulating collection of over 40,000 volumes in a closed stack system and includes general reference materials, museum archives, artist files, and auction catalogues.  Free Internet access is provided.\n\n'''Lending Collection:''' Art objects, crafts and folk arts from around the world, books, and art work reproductions are some of the many items available for loan in the Lending Collection.  Located in the basement of the Museum Art Center at Linekona, the Lending Collection is available to schools, libraries, and other community organizations.\n\n===Educational programs===\nSchool programs include art classes for Special Education students and programs for fifth graders in Hawai{{okina}}i public schools, which combine museum tours and hands-on experience creating art in studio classes at the art center.\n\n===Exhibitions===\nThe center features exhibitions throughout the year for original local artworks. Traveling exhibitions, and works by Hawai{{okina}}i's contemporary artists, folk artists, and young people are often offered along with supplementary workshops and lectures by mainland and neighbor island artists.\n\n===Lending collection===\nThe Lending Collection offers reproductions, original artworks, books and objects  for loan and hands-on study to educators, students, and community groups.  Located in the basement of the Honolulu Museum of Art School, the Lending Collection is open Wednesday, Friday and Saturday or by appointment.\n\n===Honolulu Printmaking Workshop===\nThe Honolulu Printmaking Workshop is a not-for-profit community access studio with presses and technical supplies for lithography, [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] and relief printmaking.\n\n===Art To Go===\nThis outreach program began in 2003 for youth at risk in Hawai{{okina}}i. Art To Go brings art instruction and art supplies to underserved youth throughout the community in cooperation with social service agencies and public schools.\n\n==Luce Pavilion Complex==\nThe Luce Pavilion complex, opened May 13, 2001, includes a new cafe, gift shop, and a two-story building with two {{convert|4000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} galleries. Other facilities include underground storage, loading dock, dry-pipe fire sprinklers, vertical transportation systems for passengers, remote video broadcast capabilities, conservation lighting control systems, and climate control system. The Luce Pavilion Complex is completely wheelchair accessible.  The project cost over $9 million.\n\nThe complex added {{convert|26000|sqft|m2}}, increasing the museum size to {{convert|143000|sqft|m2}}.  \nThe Luce Foundation donated $3.5 million towards the construction of the complex.\nGround breaking ceremonies for the complex were held on September 23, 1999 and grand opening was May 13, 2001.\t\nThe Henry R. Luce Gallery holds traveling exhibitions.\n\n===The John Dominis and Patches Damon Holt Gallery===\nThe second floor gallery of the Henry R. Luce Wing in the Luce Pavilion Complex houses  a pictorial record of Hawaiian history.\nThe John Dominis and Patches Damon Holt Gallery includes an introduction to indigenous [[Hawaiian art]], early Western views of Hawai{{okina}}i, and the art of contemporary Hawai{{okina}}i-based artists.  The gallery reflects changing life and landscapes of post European-contact Hawai{{okina}}i as well as its exploration of Hawai{{okina}}i's changing artistic traditions as Island communities grew and became less isolated during the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nEarly views of Hawai{{okina}}i, dating from the last decades of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, by expedition artists such as England's [[John Webber]] and [[Robert Dampier]], France's [[Auguste Borget]] and [[Stanislas-Henri-Benoit Darondeau|Stanislaus Darondeau]], and Russia's [[Louis Choris]], present images of the Western world's first contact with Hawai{{okina}}i.  Nineteenth-century images by European artists such as [[George Henry Burgess|George Burgess]], [[Paul Emmert]], [[Nicholas Chevalier]], and [[James Gay Sawkins]], who passed through Hawai{{okina}}i, show the growth of Western-style communities and an appreciation for the land and sea.\n\nThe Holt Gallery also features painting, watercolors, drawings, prints and photographs by artists such as [[Enoch Wood Perry, Jr.|Enoch Wood Perry]], [[Jules Tavernier (painter)|Jules Tavernier]], [[D. Howard Hitchcock]], [[John LaFarge|John La Farge]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Ansel Adams]], [[Brett Weston]], [[Roi George Partridge|Roi Partridge]], and [[Jean Charlot]].  Works by Hawai{{okina}}i-born artists including [[Marguerite Louis Blasingame]], [[Isami Doi]], [[Hon Chew Hee]], [[Cornelia MacIntyre Foley]], and [[Keichi Kimura]] reveal the development of an indigenous modernist tradition in 20th century Hawai{{okina}}i, and include today's contemporary artists.  Other regional artists in the collection include [[Charles W. Bartlett]], [[Juliette May Fraser]], [[Shirley Ximena Hopper Russell|Shirley Russell]], [[Madge Tennent]], and [[John Chin Young|John Young]].\nThe John Dominis and Patches Damon Holt Gallery also features space for changing exhibitions which focus on the arts of Hawai{{okina}}i.\n\nThe Holt Gallery was named for John Dominis Holt and his late wife Frances \"Patches\" Damon Holt. John Dominis Holt was born to part-Hawaiian parents of ali{{okina}}i rank.  He learned the religion, customs, mythology, and the Hawaiian language.  By the time he was a teen, he was already a genealogist.\n\nHonorary trustee of the museum and wife of John Dominis Holt, Frances \"Patches\" Damon Holt was actively involved in many cultural projects.  Descendant of a missionary family and a graduate of Punahou School, she received a law degree from Columbia University and was educated in England.  Together with her older sister, Harriet Baldwin, she helped to oppose the H-3 project through Moanalua Valley.  They also established a foundation to help preserve cultural and environmental values.\n\n===Caf\u00e9===\nThe caf\u00e9 was established in 1969 to raise funds to purchase art. It had a simple menu and for over twenty years was operated by volunteers. Professional management and staff were gradually added. In September 1999, the caf\u00e9 was moved during construction of the Luce Pavilion Complex, and more than doubled in size to {{convert|3100|sqft|m2}}. It overlooks a granite waterfall with reflection pond and a glass sculpture by Seattle glass artist [[Dale Chihuly]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nTirthankara, India, Akota, Gujarat, 7th century, bronze, HAA.JPG|Tirthankara, Akota, India, 7th century\n'Tirthankara', India, Mysore, Karnataka, 10th-11th century, bronze with silver content, Honolulu Academy of Arts.JPG|Tirthankara, India, 10th-11th century\nWLA haa Malli Madhya Padesh.jpg|Tirthankar, India, c. 1118 AD\nMiniature bronze Ganesha from India, 19th century, --Honolulu Academy of Arts--.JPG|Ganesha, Bronze, India, 19th century\nVishnu with two attendants, Kashmir, 8th-9th century, brass with silver inlay, HAA.JPG|Vishnu with two attendants, India, 8th-9th century\nChinese tomb sculpture of farmer, Han dynasty, 1st-2nd century CE, earthenware, HAA.JPG|Chinese tomb sculpture of farmer, Han dynasty, 1st-2nd century CE\nDog, Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), earthenware with polychrome.JPG|Dog, China, Han dynasty, 206 BCE-220 CE\nThe Star God of Longevity, China, Ming dynasty, 16th century, glazed stoneware, HAA.JPG|The Star God of Longevity, China, Ming dynasty, 16th century\nAmida, Japan, Muromachi period, 15th century, wood and gold, HAA.JPG|Amida, Japan, Muromachi period, 15th century\nProcessional Mask of Guardian Deity, Japan, Heian period, 1086, HAA.jpg|Processional Mask of Guardian Deity, Japan, Heian period, 1086\nGilt bronze statue of Sakyamuni from Korea, Unified Silla Kingdom, 8th-9th century, HAA.JPG|Gilt bronze statue of Sakyamuni, Korea, Unified Silla Kingdom, 8th-9th century\nHevajra statue from Nepal, 19th century, gilt bronze, Honolulu Museum of Art.JPG|Hevajra statue, Nepal, 19th century\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Gustav Ecke]]\n*[[Honolulu Museum of Art School]]\n*[[Richard Douglas Lane]]\n*[[Shangri La (Doris Duke)]]\n*[[Spalding House]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |last = Ecke, Gustav |first =  |year = 1965 |title = Chinese painting in Hawaii, in the Honolulu Academy of Arts and in private collections |publisher = University Academy of Arts | location = Honolulu |isbn=|ref = harv}}\n* Ellis, George R., ''Honolulu Academy of Arts, Selected Works'', Honolulu, Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1990.\n* Ellis, George R. and Marcia Morse, ''A Hawaii Treasury, Masterpieces from the Honolulu Academy of Arts'', Tokyo, Asahi Shimbun, 2000.\n* Honolulu Academy of Arts, ''Academy Album; A Pictorial Selection of Works of Art in the Collections'', Honolulu, Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1968.\n* Honolulu Museum of Art, ''Honolulu Museum of Art Collection Highlights'', Honolulu Museum of Art, 2016 {{ISBN|9780937426913}}\n* [[Stephen Little|Little, Stephen]], ''Visions of the Dharma, Japanese Buddhist paintings and prints in the Honolulu Academy of Arts'', Honolulu, Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1991, {{ISBN|0937426148}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Official website}}\n*[https://art.honolulumuseum.org/collections Online gallery]\n\n{{Hawaiian Art}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1922 establishments in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Art museums established in 1922]]\n[[Category:Art museums in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Asian art museums in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Bertram Goodhue buildings]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Museums on the National Register of Historic Places]]\n[[Category:Gardens in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Hawaiian architecture]]\n[[Category:Institutions accredited by the American Alliance of Museums]]\n[[Category:Mediterranean Revival architecture in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Museums in Honolulu]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Honolulu]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Art museum in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States}}\n{{infobox museum\n|name=        The Honolulu Museum of Art\n|image=       Honolulu Museum of Art - entrance_veranda.JPG\n|imagesize=   260px\n|established= 1922\n|location=    900 South Beretania Street (between Ward and Victoria Streets), [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]\n|director=    Mark Burak\n|website=     {{URL|www.honolulumuseum.org}}\n| embedded = {{Infobox NRHP\n | name = Honolulu Academy of Arts\n | embed = yes\n | nrhp_type = \n | image = \n | caption = \n | location = 900 S.

In 2011, [[Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House|The Contemporary Museum]] gifted its assets and collection to the Honolulu Academy of Arts; in 2012, the combined museum changed its name to the Honolulu Museum of Art.\n\nThe museum is accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]] and is registered as a [[National Historic Site (United States)|National and State Historical site]]. In 1990, the Honolulu Museum of Art School was opened to expand the program of studio art classes and workshops. In 2001, the [[Henry R. Luce]] Pavilion Complex opened with the Honolulu Museum of Art Caf\u00e9, Museum Shop, and Henry R.

Admission is free to members, children and for some events, but otherwise a fee is charged. Some events and certain days offer free admission to all.\nGuided tours are offered several times daily. Tours in the [[Japanese language]], for the hearing impaired and specialty group tours for 10 or more are also available.\n\n===Hours===\nThe museum is open from 10 a.m. to 4:30&nbsp;p.m.  from Tuesday to Sunday. Closed on Monday.\n\n===Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House===\n{{main|Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House}}\nThe museum's second location, [[Spalding House]] (formerly The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu), is located in [[Makiki Heights]] and includes galleries, a caf\u00e9, and a sculpture garden. On permanent view is [[David Hockney|David Hockney's]] installation \"[[L'enfant et les sortil\u00e8ges]],\" the artist's interpretation of his original stage designs for the 1981 [[Metropolitan Opera]] production.\n\n===Doris Duke Theatre===\nThe [[Doris Duke]] Theatre at the museum seats 280. It hosts movies, concerts, lectures, and presentations. The theatre is also home to Hawaii's [[GLBT]] film festival the [[Rainbow Film Festival]]. It is currently run by Theatre Manager, Taylour Chang.\n\n===Robert Allerton Art Library===\nIn 1927, the Research Library opened with 500 books. In 1955, it was expanded and named for [[Robert Allerton|Robert Allerto]]n. The collection includes 45,000 books and periodicals, biographical files on artists, and auction catalogues dating to the beginning of the 20th century. The museum has over 8,000 woodblock prints, many of which were gifts from [[James A. Michener]]. More than 2,000 Japanese ukiyo-e prints are digitized and available for viewing online. The library is a non-circulating research facility. The library reading room is open on Wednesdays.\n\n===Honolulu Museum of Art School===\n{{main|Honolulu Museum of Art School}}\nArts education is another facet of the museum. The Honolulu Museum of Art School (formerly the Academy Art Center at Linekona) offers studio art classes and workshops, and hosts exhibitions showcasing the island's folk and contemporary artists. The school offers arts education programs for children with special needs and public school students and maintains a lending collection for educators, students, and community groups.\n\n===Shangri La: Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art===\n{{main|Shangri La (Doris Duke)|Doris Duke}}\n\n[[Doris Duke]] (1912\u20131993) built Shangri La with the help of American architect [[Marion Sims Wyeth]]. Duke's collection of Islamic art was assembled over 60 years.\n\n==History==\n[[Anna Rice Cooke]] (1853\u20131934), daughter of New England missionaries and founder of the Honolulu Museum of Art, in her dedication statement at the opening of the museum on April 8, 1927 said:\n<blockquote>\"That our children of many nationalities and races, born far from the centers of art, may receive an intimation of their own cultural legacy and wake to the ideals embodied in the arts of their neighbors ... that Hawaiians, Americans, Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos, Northern Europeans and all other people living here, contacting through the channel of art those deep intuitions common to all, may perceive a foundation on which a new culture, enriched by the old strains may be built in the islands.\"&nbsp;&mdash;''[[Anna Rice Cooke]]''<ref name=\"Ellis, George R. 1990, p.10\">Ellis, George R., ''Honolulu Academy of Arts, Selected Works'', Honolulu, Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1990, p.10</ref></blockquote>Born on [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] in 1853, Cooke grew up on [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i island]] in a home that appreciated the arts. In 1874, she married [[Charles Montague Cooke]] and the two eventually settled in Honolulu.  In 1882, they built a home on Beretania Street, across from [[Thomas Square]]. As Cooke's career prospered, they gathered their private art collection.  First were \"parlor pieces\" for their home.  She frequented the shop of furniture maker Yeun Kwock Fong Inn who often had ceramics and textile pieces sent from his brother in China.\n\nThe Cookes\u2019 art collection outgrew their home and the homes of their children. In 1920, she and her daughter Alice (Mrs. Phillip Spalding), her daughter-in-law Dagmar (Mrs. Richard Cooke), and [[Catharine Elizabeth Bean Cox|Catharine E. B. Cox]] (Mrs. Isaac Cox), an art and drama teacher, began to catalogue and research the collection with the intent to display the items in a museum.   \nWith little formal training, these women obtained a charter for the museum from the [[Territory of Hawaii]] in 1922, while continuing to catalogue the collection. Cooke wanted a museum that reflected Hawai{{okina}}i's multi-cultural make-up. Not bound by the traditional western idea of art museums, she also wanted to showcase the island's climate in an open and airy environment, using courtyards which interconnect the galleries throughout the museum.\n\nThe Cookes donated their Beretania Street land along with an endowment of $25,000.  Their home was torn down to make way for the museum. New York architect [[Bertram Goodhue]] designed a classic Hawaiian-style building with simple off-white exteriors and tiled roofs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gurewitsch|first=Matthew|title=A Hawaiian Grand Tour|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=December 26, 2013|page=D5}}</ref>   Goodhue died before the project was completed; it was finished by [[Mayers Murray & Phillip|Hardie Phillip]]. This style has been imitated in many buildings throughout the state.\n\nOn April 8, 1927, the Honolulu Museum of Art opened.  There was a traditional Hawaiian blessing and the [[Royal Hawaiian Band]], under the direction of [[Henri Berger]], played at festivities. With the opening of the museum came gifts of many pieces, sometimes even entire collections. Additions to the original building include a library (1956), an education wing (1960), a gift shop (1965), a cafe (1969), a contemporary gallery, administrative offices and 292-seat theater (1977), and an art center for studio classes and expanded educational programming (1989).  In 1999, the museum created a children's interactive gallery, lecture hall, and offices.<ref name=\"Ellis, George R. 1990, p.10\"/>\n\nThe original building was named Hawai{{okina}}i's best building by the Hawai{{okina}}i Chapter of the American Institute of Architecture and is registered as a National and State Historical site.  The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.\n\nIn 1998, extensive renovation began starting with the Asian wing. In September 1999, construction began on the John Hara-designed Henry R. Luce Pavilion Complex, which opened May 13, 2001.  It includes expanded spaces for The Pavilion Caf\u00e9 and The Museum Shop and a new two-story exhibition structure. The Luce Complex is named for [[Henry R. Luce]], the co-founder and editor of [[Time Magazine]] and other publications. His widow, [[Clare Boothe Luce]], had a residence in Hawai{{okina}}i and served on the museum's board of trustees from 1972&ndash;1977.\n[[File:Shakyamuni and the Eight Great Bodhisattvas, Korea, Chos\u00f4n Dynasty, 16th Cent., ink, color & gold on silk.jpg|thumb|[[Gautama Buddha]] and the Eight Great [[Bodhisattva]]s, Korea, [[Joseon Dynasty]], 16th century]]\nNew galleries exploring cross-cultural influences, were renovated and re-opened in the Western Wing in November 1999. A new gallery for [[Korean art]] was opened in June 2001.  New galleries for the arts of India, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia were renovated and opened in January 2002. A new gallery for the art of the Philippines named for retiring Museum Director and his wife, George and Nancy Ellis, opened in 2003.  In February 2005, the museum opened an Asian Painting Conservation Studio and in December 2005, completed renovation of the Western Art galleries.\n\nIn 2001, the museum entered into a partnership with the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art and the theater was refurbished and renamed for her in July 2002. In October 2002, the museum opened a new gallery that serves as the orientation center for all tours to Doris Duke's Honolulu estate Shangri La, which started on November 6, 2002.\n\nDue to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Hawaii|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] the museum laid off one third of its full-time workers & every seasonal worker that worked part time to reduce the spread of [[COVID-19]] on on April 17th 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/04/17/breaking-news/honolulu-museum-of-art-lays-off-a-third-of-full-timers-all-part-timers-and-seasonal-help/|title=Honolulu Museum of Art lays off a third of full-timers, all part-timers and seasonal help| date=April 17, 2020|first1= Leila|last1=Fujimori |work=[[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]]}}</ref>\n\nThe museum's permanent collection grew to over 38,000 pieces with significant holdings in Asian art, American and European painting and decorative arts, 19th- and 20th-century art, an extensive collection of works on paper, Asian textiles, and traditional works from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas.\n\n\n\n=== The Contemporary Museum and Honolulu Academy of Arts Merge ===\nThe former [[Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House|Contemporary Museum, Honolulu]] in [[Makiki|Makiki Heights]] was integrated into the Honolulu Academy of Arts in July 2011. The Academy's board of trustees voted in December 2011 to change the museum's public name to the Honolulu Museum of Art as of March 2012, retaining its legal name as the Honolulu Academy of Arts. The former Contemporary Museum, or [[Spalding House]], became the Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House, the Art Center at Linekona became the [[Honolulu Museum of Art School]], and The Contemporary Museum at [[First Hawaiian Center]] became the Honolulu Museum of Art at First Hawaiian Center.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nakagawa|first1=Lynn|title=Honolulu Academy of Arts to be renamed Honolulu Museum of Art|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2011/12/07/honolulu-academy-of-arts-to-be-renamed.html|accessdate=19 June 2014|publisher=Pacific Business News|date=December 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Sale of Spalding House ===\nOn July 16, 2019, the museum announced that its board of trustees would be selling [[Spalding House]] in an effort to \"allow the museum to focus its resources on its main campus at Beretania Street.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/07/16/breaking-news/honolulu-museum-of-art-to-sell-historical-spalding-house-in-makiki/|title=Honolulu Museum of Art to sell historic Spalding House in Makiki|last=nwu@staradvertiser.com|first=By Nina Wu|last2=July 16|first2=2019|date=2019-07-16|website=Honolulu Star-Advertiser|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-04}}</ref>\n\nInterim director and trustee, Mark Burak, stated: \"From a fiduciary standpoint, we\u2019ve taken a very long and hard look at this from all angles. While the Spalding House property\u2019s beauty and historic significance make it hard to part with, it has also been challenging splitting our attention between two large, resource-intensive art campuses, one limited by several factors that have made it difficult to deliver the kind of quality art exhibitions, programs and services we have desired.\u201d\n\nTrustee and chairman of the Building and Grounds Committee, Jim Pearce, added: \"The committee concluded unanimously that it would be to the long-term benefit of HoMA to prepare [[Spalding House]] for sale. We are fortunate to have a board and employees who carefully evaluate all options for the future and are continually making changes to ensure that we maintain the solid financial footing necessary to fulfill our mission. Making and enabling this decision has been determined to represent good business practice for the long term.\u201d said Jim Pierce, trustee and chairman of the Building and Grounds Committee, in the release.\n\nFollowing these comments regarding the fiduciary responsibility of the Board, many community members speculated on well-being of the institution. In his editorial, [https://www.civilbeat.org/2019/07/sterling-higa-loss-of-spalding-house-a-reminder-old-money-alone-wont-sustain-the-arts/ Loss Of Spalding House A Reminder Old Money Alone Won\u2019t Sustain The Arts], Sterling Higa speculated on the financial history of the institution, wide spread urban development across Honolulu, and the arrival of new foreign investment. He writes: \"Our islands play host to out-of-state wealth. Japanese, Canadian and Chinese money pours in. Silicon Valley billionaires plant roots. Given the context, it seems likely that Spalding House will be sold to a foreign buyer, and the grounds will no longer be accessible to the general public. We can pray for salvation, but salvation may not come. Better to hope that the new oligarchy is as generous as the old oligarchy, which bequeathed us relics like Spalding House.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.civilbeat.org/2019/07/sterling-higa-loss-of-spalding-house-a-reminder-old-money-alone-wont-sustain-the-arts/|title=Sterling Higa: Loss Of Spalding House A Reminder Old Money Alone Won't Sustain The Arts|date=2019-07-26|website=Honolulu Civil Beat|language=en|access-date=2019-08-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Directors ===\n\n* [[Frank Montague Moore]] (1924\u20131927)\n* [[Catharine Elizabeth Bean Cox|Mrs. Isaac M.

Docents are trained to provide gallery tours for the Tea and Tour and Movie and Art Talk programs as well as educational activities such as Keiki-Parent Activity Tours and art experiences for seniors.\n\n===Tours===\nDocents conduct tours for the public, school groups (pre-school and up), and community organizations. Groups of ten or more persons and classes are requested to schedule tours at least two weeks in advance.\nIn a program called Tour and Tea, docents lead discussions in the galleries followed by iced tea in the courtyard.\nAn introductory tour called Treasures of the museum highlights selected works in the permanent collection.\n\nSpecial tours, focusing on temporary exhibitions often include supplementary materials and activities, some especially designed for children. Workshops and exhibition previews for teachers and other educators may also be offered.\nTheme tours concentrate on a specific country, region, time period, art movement, or groups of artists. Museum tours may be customized to correspond to the specific requirement of a class or group.\n\nA training program preparing volunteers to provide docent-guided tours is held only when needed. The four-semester course includes an overview of the museum's collections and programs and a survey of world art.   Docent Council meetings are conducted throughout the year along with continuing education of the museum collections and special training sessions for all major and traveling exhibitions.\n\n===Movie and Art Talk===\nArt documentaries are shown on selected Wednesday afternoons in the Education Lecture Hall.  Following the film, docents connect the film to the museum collection and continue with a discussion in the gallery.\n\n===Children===\nFamilies with children can pick up materials at the front desk.  Keiki Kit include booklets with stories to read, games and puzzles to solve, and a take-home activity.  Gallery Hunt Activity Sheets send the families through the galleries to find certain works of art that focus on a theme.

Luce Gallery holds traveling exhibitions.\n\n===The John Dominis and Patches Damon Holt Gallery===\nThe second floor gallery of the Henry R. Luce Wing in the Luce Pavilion Complex houses  a pictorial record of Hawaiian history.\nThe John Dominis and Patches Damon Holt Gallery includes an introduction to indigenous [[Hawaiian art]], early Western views of Hawai{{okina}}i, and the art of contemporary Hawai{{okina}}i-based artists.  The gallery reflects changing life and landscapes of post European-contact Hawai{{okina}}i as well as its exploration of Hawai{{okina}}i's changing artistic traditions as Island communities grew and became less isolated during the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nEarly views of Hawai{{okina}}i, dating from the last decades of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, by expedition artists such as England's [[John Webber]] and [[Robert Dampier]], France's [[Auguste Borget]] and [[Stanislas-Henri-Benoit Darondeau|Stanislaus Darondeau]], and Russia's [[Louis Choris]], present images of the Western world's first contact with Hawai{{okina}}i.  Nineteenth-century images by European artists such as [[George Henry Burgess|George Burgess]], [[Paul Emmert]], [[Nicholas Chevalier]], and [[James Gay Sawkins]], who passed through Hawai{{okina}}i, show the growth of Western-style communities and an appreciation for the land and sea.\n\nThe Holt Gallery also features painting, watercolors, drawings, prints and photographs by artists such as [[Enoch Wood Perry, Jr.|Enoch Wood Perry]], [[Jules Tavernier (painter)|Jules Tavernier]], [[D. Howard Hitchcock]], [[John LaFarge|John La Farge]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Ansel Adams]], [[Brett Weston]], [[Roi George Partridge|Roi Partridge]], and [[Jean Charlot]].  Works by Hawai{{okina}}i-born artists including [[Marguerite Louis Blasingame]], [[Isami Doi]], [[Hon Chew Hee]], [[Cornelia MacIntyre Foley]], and [[Keichi Kimura]] reveal the development of an indigenous modernist tradition in 20th century Hawai{{okina}}i, and include today's contemporary artists.  Other regional artists in the collection include [[Charles W. Bartlett]], [[Juliette May Fraser]], [[Shirley Ximena Hopper Russell|Shirley Russell]], [[Madge Tennent]], and [[John Chin Young|John Young]].\nThe John Dominis and Patches Damon Holt Gallery also features space for changing exhibitions which focus on the arts of Hawai{{okina}}i.\n\nThe Holt Gallery was named for John Dominis Holt and his late wife Frances \"Patches\" Damon Holt. John Dominis Holt was born to part-Hawaiian parents of ali{{okina}}i rank.  He learned the religion, customs, mythology, and the Hawaiian language.  By the time he was a teen, he was already a genealogist.\n\nHonorary trustee of the museum and wife of John Dominis Holt, Frances \"Patches\" Damon Holt was actively involved in many cultural projects.  Descendant of a missionary family and a graduate of Punahou School, she received a law degree from Columbia University and was educated in England.  Together with her older sister, Harriet Baldwin, she helped to oppose the H-3 project through Moanalua Valley.  They also established a foundation to help preserve cultural and environmental values.\n\n===Caf\u00e9===\nThe caf\u00e9 was established in 1969 to raise funds to purchase art. It had a simple menu and for over twenty years was operated by volunteers. Professional management and staff were gradually added. In September 1999, the caf\u00e9 was moved during construction of the Luce Pavilion Complex, and more than doubled in size to {{convert|3100|sqft|m2}}. It overlooks a granite waterfall with reflection pond and a glass sculpture by Seattle glass artist [[Dale Chihuly]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nTirthankara, India, Akota, Gujarat, 7th century, bronze, HAA.JPG|Tirthankara, Akota, India, 7th century\n'Tirthankara', India, Mysore, Karnataka, 10th-11th century, bronze with silver content, Honolulu Academy of Arts.JPG|Tirthankara, India, 10th-11th century\nWLA haa Malli Madhya Padesh.jpg|Tirthankar, India, c. 1118 AD\nMiniature bronze Ganesha from India, 19th century, --Honolulu Academy of Arts--.JPG|Ganesha, Bronze, India, 19th century\nVishnu with two attendants, Kashmir, 8th-9th century, brass with silver inlay, HAA.JPG|Vishnu with two attendants, India, 8th-9th century\nChinese tomb sculpture of farmer, Han dynasty, 1st-2nd century CE, earthenware, HAA.JPG|Chinese tomb sculpture of farmer, Han dynasty, 1st-2nd century CE\nDog, Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), earthenware with polychrome.JPG|Dog, China, Han dynasty, 206 BCE-220 CE\nThe Star God of Longevity, China, Ming dynasty, 16th century, glazed stoneware, HAA.JPG|The Star God of Longevity, China, Ming dynasty, 16th century\nAmida, Japan, Muromachi period, 15th century, wood and gold, HAA.JPG|Amida, Japan, Muromachi period, 15th century\nProcessional Mask of Guardian Deity, Japan, Heian period, 1086, HAA.jpg|Processional Mask of Guardian Deity, Japan, Heian period, 1086\nGilt bronze statue of Sakyamuni from Korea, Unified Silla Kingdom, 8th-9th century, HAA.JPG|Gilt bronze statue of Sakyamuni, Korea, Unified Silla Kingdom, 8th-9th century\nHevajra statue from Nepal, 19th century, gilt bronze, Honolulu Museum of Art.JPG|Hevajra statue, Nepal, 19th century\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Gustav Ecke]]\n*[[Honolulu Museum of Art School]]\n*[[Richard Douglas Lane]]\n*[[Shangri La (Doris Duke)]]\n*[[Spalding House]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |last = Ecke, Gustav |first =  |year = 1965 |title = Chinese painting in Hawaii, in the Honolulu Academy of Arts and in private collections |publisher = University Academy of Arts | location = Honolulu |isbn=|ref = harv}}\n* Ellis, George R., ''Honolulu Academy of Arts, Selected Works'', Honolulu, Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1990.\n* Ellis, George R. and Marcia Morse, ''A Hawaii Treasury, Masterpieces from the Honolulu Academy of Arts'', Tokyo, Asahi Shimbun, 2000.\n* Honolulu Academy of Arts, ''Academy Album; A Pictorial Selection of Works of Art in the Collections'', Honolulu, Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1968.\n* Honolulu Museum of Art, ''Honolulu Museum of Art Collection Highlights'', Honolulu Museum of Art, 2016 {{ISBN|9780937426913}}\n* [[Stephen Little|Little, Stephen]], ''Visions of the Dharma, Japanese Buddhist paintings and prints in the Honolulu Academy of Arts'', Honolulu, Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1991, {{ISBN|0937426148}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Official website}}\n*[https://art.honolulumuseum.org/collections Online gallery]\n\n{{Hawaiian Art}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1922 establishments in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Art museums established in 1922]]\n[[Category:Art museums in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Asian art museums in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Bertram Goodhue buildings]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Museums on the National Register of Historic Places]]\n[[Category:Gardens in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Hawaiian architecture]]\n[[Category:Institutions accredited by the American Alliance of Museums]]\n[[Category:Mediterranean Revival architecture in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Museums in Honolulu]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Honolulu]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed +", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu_Museum_of_Art"}
