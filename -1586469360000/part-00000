From 2000-2001 he was the Economy and Finance subcommittee's chairman  of the National Legislative Committee . He also worked for the Ministry of Finance as deputy minister of Regulation and Control (2000-2001). In 2001 he was appointed as Minister of Finance of Venezuela by President [[Hugo Chavez]]. He held that position until the following year, when he was designated  as Science and Technology Minister. From that position he was called by President Chavez for the presidency of Social Development Bank (BANDES), a position he left to return to the Ministry of Finance in early 2004. During his second term, took place the creation of the FONDEN, Venezuela's National Development Fund.
