For the first time, ''Killie'' reached the third round of the Scottish Cup following a [[walkover]] against [[Stewarton Cunninghame F.C.|Stewarton Cunninghame]] in the first round and a 6\u20133 win against [[Ayr F.C.|Ayr]] in the second round. A 3\u20133 draw against [[Mauchline F.C.|Mauchline]] set up third round replay in which Kilmarnock lost 3\u20130 at Rugby Park.

Kilmarnock initially defeated [[Hurlford F.C.|Hurlford]] 6\u20131 at Drumbiehill Park but a protest over a breach of registration rules was upheld and the result was declared void. The match was replayed and this time Hurlford won 3\u20131, however a similar protest by Kilmarnock was also upheld and Hurlford were disqualified from the competition. In the second round, ''Killie'' lost 4\u20131 to [[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]] at Pebble Park.\n\nA successful Ayrshire Cup campaign started with wins over [[Monkcastle F.C.|Monkcastle]] and [[Lugar Boswell Thistle F.C.|Lugar Boswell]] before Kilmarnock received a bye to the semi-finals.

The third round saw a 7\u20130 win over Annbank on Boxing Day 1885 following a protested match that Kilmarnock had won 5\u20130. [[Lanemark F.C.|Lanemark]] were defeated 3\u20131 in the semi-finals before ''Killie'' retained the trophy with a 2\u20131 win against Ayr in the final.\n\nThe Kilmarnock Merchants' Charity Cup also saw Kilmarnock end with a 100% record after they defeat Britannia and Ayr to lift the cup for the second time in three seasons.\n\n===Scottish Cup===\n{{Main|1885\u201386 Scottish Cup}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Date\n!Round\n!Opponents\n!H / A\n!Result<br />F\u2013A\n!Scorers\n!Attendance\n|-bgcolor=#ddffdd\n|12 September 1885\n|First round\n|[[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]]\n|H\n|7\u20131<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fitbastats.com/kilmarnock/game.php?gameid=30903 |title=Kilmarnock 7 - 1 Annbank United, Scottish Cup (12/09/1885) |publisher=Fitbastats.com |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n|\n|\n|-bgcolor=#eeeeee\n|3 October 1885\n|Second round\n|[[Hurlford F.C.|Hurlford]]\n|H\n|3\u20134{{Cref2|E}}\n|\n|\n|-bgcolor=#ffffcc\n|17 October 1885\n|Second round\n|Hurlford\n|H\n|1\u20131<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fitbastats.com/kilmarnock/game.php?gameid=30905 |title=Kilmarnock 7 - 1 Hurlford United, Scottish Cup (17/10/1885) |publisher=Fitbastats.com |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n|\n|2,000\n|-bgcolor=#eeeeee\n|31 October 1885\n|Second round replay\n|Hurlford\n|N\n|1\u20131{{Cref2|F}}\n|\n|2,000\n|-bgcolor=#ffffcc\n|7 November 1885\n|Second round replay\n|Hurlford\n|A\n|2\u20132<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fitbastats.com/kilmarnock/game.php?gameid=30907 |title=Annbank United 2 - 2 Kilmarnock, Scottish Cup (07/11/1885) |publisher=Fitbastats.com |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n|\n|2,000\n|-bgcolor=#ffdddd\n|14 November 1885\n|Second round second replay\n|Hurlford\n|H\n|1\u20135<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fitbastats.com/kilmarnock/game.php?gameid=30908 |title=Kilmarnock 1 - 5 Hurlford United, Scottish Cup (14/11/1885) |publisher=Fitbastats.com |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n|\n|\n|}\n\n;Notes\n{{Cnote2 Begin|liststyle=disc}}\n{{Cnote2|E|'''E'''- A protest from Kilmarnock regarding a breach of registration rules was upheld by the [[Scottish Football Association]] and a rematch was ordered.<ref name=\"Every game\"/>}}\n{{Cnote2|F|'''F'''- Played at Ayr.

Kilmarnock lifted the Ayr Charity Cup for the first time after thumping [[Ayr F.C.|Ayr]] 5\u20131 but the final of the Kilmarnock Merchants' Charity Cup went unplayed after Kilmarnock refused to play just five days after their semi-final replay victory over Kilmarnock Thistle.

In the second round, ''Killie'' lost 4\u20131 to [[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]] at Pebble Park.\n\nA successful Ayrshire Cup campaign started with wins over [[Monkcastle F.C.|Monkcastle]] and [[Lugar Boswell Thistle F.C.|Lugar Boswell]] before Kilmarnock received a bye to the semi-finals.

Many missions to Mars have also included dedicated observations of the Moons, while this section is about missions focused solely on them. There have been three unsuccessful dedicated missions and many proposals. Because of the proximity of the Mars moons to Mars, any mission to them may also be considered a mission to Mars from some perspectives.\n\nThere have been at least three proposals in the United States [[Discovery Program]], including PADME, PANDORA, and MERLIN.<ref name=tps/> The ESA has also considered a sample return mission, one of the latest known as Martian Moon Sample Return or MMSR, and it may use heritage from an asteroid sample return mission.<ref name=\"adsabs.harvard.edu\">[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011epsc.conf..849M MMSR - a study for a Martian Moon Sample Return mission]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 0;\"\n!

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto.

It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants.<ref name=\"Trautmann The Biography\" /> Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm|title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999|last=Efs|first=Thomas|date=23 June 2006|website=European Football Statistics|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm|archivedate=3 January 2014|accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants.<ref name=\"Trautmann The Biography\" /> Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm|title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999|last=Efs|first=Thomas|date=23 June 2006|website=European Football Statistics|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm|archivedate=3 January 2014|accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

Separated from its nearest neighbors ([[Pico Island|Pico]] and [[Faial Island|Faial]] islands) by  the {{convert|15|km|mi}} Pico-S\u00e3o Jorge Channel, the central group is often referred colloquially as part of the ''Triangulo'' (\"Triangle\") group or just \"The Triangle\". S\u00e3o Jorge is a relatively long thin island with tall cliffs, whose 9500 inhabitants are concentrated on various geological debris fields (''faj\u00e3s'') along the north and south coasts; from east to west, the island is {{convert|53|km|mi}} long and, north to south, {{convert|8|km|mi}} wide: its area is {{convert|237.59|km2|mi2}}.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Matriz de N S do Rosario, Topo, Azores.jpg|235px|thumb|left|One of the earliest churches on the island of S\u00e3o Jorge, the Matriz Church of Nossa Senhora do Ros\u00e1rio, in Topo]]\nIt is unclear when the first explorers discovered the island of S\u00e3o Jorge; as part of the politics of human occupation, the Azores were populated after 1430 (probably 1439) through the initiative of [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry the Navigator]]. 23 April, known as the feast day of [[Saint George]], has been cited by historians as the reason for the island's name, although this is likely conjecture. Genovese and Catalan maps of the 14th century originally designated the long, slender island \"S\u00e3o Jorge\", a designation that was maintained by Infante D. Henrique when settlers from northern Europe began to colonize the island (around 1460, or twenty years after it was first sighted).\n\nAlthough unclear, Azorean chroniclers believe that settlement on the island concentrated around the two communities of Velas and Calheta, and developed into the interior. It was in 1460 that the construction of the first church dedicated to S\u00e3o Jorge occurred in the area of Velas, from the testaments of Infante D. Henrique. What is certain is that the island was populated by the time that Jo\u00e3o Vaz Corte Real, the Donatary-Captain of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]] ([[Terceira]]) obtained the [[captaincy]] of the island, by contract on 4 May 1483. By 1500, the settlement of Velas was elevated from villa to municipality (giving rise to the supposition that Velas was the first center on the island). By 1659, the parochial church had already undergone public restoration, that gave origin the present church in that municipality.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful adventure to the island of Flores, the Flemish nobleman  [[Willem van der Haegen]] (later known as Guilherme da Silveira) moved to the area of Topo where he established and founded a local community, in 1480. After living there for several years he died and was buried in the chapel of the Casa dos Tiagos. Topo was eventually elevated to capital of the municipality by 1510, but lost this title to Calheta on June 3, 1534. During this period, the island was wild and many of the roads difficult or non-existent between the communities, resulting in isolated villages located along the coast.  Connections between these communities developed by sea, and the better provisioned ports were likely to develop economically.  This was the case with Calheta, Urzelina and Velas; the sites, although farther from the Terceira (the towns are located on the opposite coast), were preferred way-points due to secure and sheltered ports, with good anchorage and providing many goods and services. The growth of the population was rapid, and by the mid-17th century, S\u00e3o Jorge had approximately 3000 inhabitants and three towns: Velas, Topo and Calheta. The island demonstrated a strong economic vitality:  in addition to wine, corn, and yam, it was also an important exporter of [[woad]] to Flanders and other countries in Europe.\n\nThe dynastic crisis (1580) caused by the ascension of King [[Philip II of Spain]] (King Philip I of Portugal) had consequences on the island, since gentry supported (along with those on Terceira) the pretender to the throne, D. [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]]. King D. Ant\u00f3nio reigned on the continent for about twenty days, until he was defeated at the [[Battle of Alc\u00e2ntara (1580)|Battle of Alc\u00e2ntra]], whereupon he moved his court to Terceira Island and governed in opposition until 1583. The Habsburg-supported King Phillip finally defeated his forces at sea at the [[Battle of Ponta Delgada]] between July 25\u201326, 1582, and the garrisons in S\u00e3o Jorge only capitulated to the forces of Castillo after the fall of Terceira in 1583.\n\nFollowing 1583, the island experienced a period of relative isolation, partially due to the poor quality of its ports and its limited economic importance. After the Spanish occupation, it was largely abandoned and its inhabitants were left to survive a meager existence. The island did not escape Atlantic piracy: the islanders were subject to attacks by English and French privateers in 1589 and 1590, raiders after 1590 (from the [[Barbary coast]] and lands occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]) and during the 17th and 18th centuries (mostly around Calheta). In 1625, the inhabitants of Faj\u00e3 de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o were captured by pirates and likely sold into slavery. The tranquillity around the island was also broken on September 20, 1708, when the town of Velas was attacked by French pirates under the command of [[Ren\u00e9 Duguay-Trouin]]. The population of the community resisted for twenty-four hours, but eventually the pirates made shore where they disembarked. The resistance, commanded by Sergeant-major Amaro Soares de Sousa, occurred around the village of Banquetas saving the other villages from occupation and pillaging.\n\nPeriods of local prosperity or misery occurred in the following years; there were several bad growing seasons and natural catastrophes (such as the earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tornados in 1580, 1757, 1808 and 1899) that created famines and hardships. The most famous of these eruptions began in the early morning of May 1, 1808 ([[Urzelina (volcano)|Urzelina eruption]]). Suffocating gases, as  well as carboxylic acid, were emitted from a vent along the Manadas ridge and thick greenish vaporous clouds (of chloric and sulfuric acids) rapidly spread to the plants. Eight major tremors were recorded per hour that caused widespread panic. Many of the homes, buildings and cultivatable lands were destroyed. Between 1580 and 1907, at least six significant eruptions occurred; ten people were killed during the 1580 eruption and eight in 1808. In 1850, the island's vineyards were devastated by the [[phylloxera|phylloxera plague]], which had a terrible effect on the economy until the development of the orange industry (about 1860). The island's isolation ended after the completion of the ports of Velas and Calheta.\n\nDuring the Portuguese [[Liberal Wars|Civil War]], Liberalist forces were stationed on the island after May 10, 1831.  Generally, the island's residents have lived for many years in isolation, interrupted by rare visits from the authorities, commercial boats from the local islands, and the occasional nobleman who has come to contemplate the local scenery.\n\nWith the inauguration of its ports, and the [[S\u00e3o Jorge Airport|airport/aerodrome]] (April 23, 1982) commercial ventures have grown (especially the export of the local cheese), the expansion of animal husbandry, the fisheries and a small crafts industry.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n[[File:Ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge, A\u00e7ores, Portugal, costa Sul.JPG|235px|thumb|right|The southern coast of S\u00e3o Jorge, with its rugged cliffs along the southeastern part of Calheta]]\nUnique among the islands of Azores, S\u00e3o Jorge is uncharacteristically  long and slender and susceptible to ocean erosion. The island was built on fissural volcanism associated with the plate tectonics of the mid-Atlantic Ridge and a transform fault that extends from the Ridge to the island of S\u00e3o Miguel (referred to as the S\u00e3o Jorge Fault). Through successive fissural eruptions the island was built-up: the only remnants of these forces are the line of volcanic cones that extend along the central ridge (approximately 700 metres in altitude).\n\nThe island was built-up from successive morphological structures of progressively younger materials, these include:\n\n* [[Topo Volcanic Complex]] - predominantly built of basalt,  [[hawaiite]],  and mugearite lavas and pyroclastic deposits and Strombolian cinder cones. Materials in this formation were produced are about 600,000 years in age.\n* Rosais Volcanic Complex - consisting of the northeastern portion of the island, with a similar composition to those materials in Topo.\n* Manadas Volcanic Complex - most recent formation composed of Strombolian cones and two Surtseyan cones (Morro de Lemos and Morro Velho), as well as craters and tuff rings resulting from [[Phreatomagmatic]] activity.\n\nThe island is 55&nbsp;km in length from the Ponta dos Rosais until the Topo Islet and a maximum width between Faj\u00e3 das Pontas and Portinho da Calheta (approximately  7&nbsp;km). The highest point is [[Pico da Esperan\u00e7a]] at 1,053&nbsp;meters.  The island has an area of 246&nbsp;km\u00b2, with an obvious difference in the relief between the western and eastern portions of the island: the western coast is ringed with cliffs, while the eastern coast is morphologically smoother. Similarly, the contrast between the northern and southern coasts are obvious; apart from several deltas (faj\u00e3s) on both coasts, the northern coast has sharp cliffs, while the southern coast is less inclined.  The majority of the cliffs in the northeast are between 300 and 400 m with severe slopes (between 45\u00b0 and 55\u00b0). In this area, many of the faj\u00e3s, some composed of lavas (Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, Faj\u00e3 das Pontas and Faj\u00e3 da Ribeira da Areia) and others dendritic (Faj\u00e3 de Jo\u00e3o Dias and Faj\u00e3 da Penedia), are visible. In the southwest the cliffs are approximately 100m in height and most settlements are located along the lava deltas, such as the Faj\u00e3 das  Velas, Faj\u00e3 da Queimada, Faj\u00e3  Grande and Faj\u00e3 da Calheta.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBeing located in the middle  of the Atlantic Ocean, in an area of high pressures the island benefits  from the influence of the Gulf Stream that maintains water temperatures  between 17 and 23&nbsp;\u00b0C, and atmospheric temperatures hovering between 13 and 24&nbsp;\u00b0C. Annual humidity hovers around 75% and the level of precipitation has molded the physical appearance of the island.\n\n=== Human geography ===\n[[File:Faj\u00e3 de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, vista, Calheta, S\u00e3o Jorge, A\u00e7ores.JPG|235ppx|thumb|Faj\u00e3 de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o]]\n[[File:24 ilha de s\u00e3o jorge, a\u00e7ores1.jpg|thumb|Faj\u00e3 de Santo Cristo]]\nThe geomorphology of the island (its high cliffs, rough central plateaus and scattered faj\u00e3s) resulted in the concentration of human settlements along the coast. Historically these communities were linked by coastal ports since the trails in the interior were barely transitable. Consequently, communities were isolated from one another necessitating local solutions to common problems and building local ties between families. Velas, Calheta and Topo developed partially due to well developed ports and local economies, in addition to administrative necessity and central positions. The settlements developed with immigration from Spain and Flanders, principally by settlers brought by the \u00c1vilas and by Willem van de Hagen.\n\nAdministratively, S\u00e3o Jorge is divided into two municipalities:  [[Calheta (Azores)|Calheta]] in the east with five parishes and [[Velas]] in the west with six parishes. The rural population is basically aligned along the lines of communication divided by areas of unpopulated pastureland between localities.\n\n== Economy ==\nAfter a period of small subsistence agriculture, the local economy began to concentrate on a few chief exports: initially, lichen ('''''[[Roccella tinctoria]]''''') and woad ('''''[[Isatis tinctoria]]'''''), later the introduction of wheat and corn crops. Woad was one of the most important exports from S\u00e3o Jorge and the Azores; it was initially introduced by Willem van der Hagen around 1490, and exported primarily to his countrymen in Flanders. Both woad and lichen were very popular in central Europe as a dye.\n\nThese exports were later superseded by grapes and wine after 1571 and endured for the next three centuries. It was first disseminated along the southern coast, owing to the fertile soils, and adapted well to many of the faj\u00e3s of Calheta (including Faj\u00e3 dos Vimes, Faj\u00e3 de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, and Faj\u00e3 Grande), as well as the areas between Ribeira do Almeirda and the parish of Queimadas (in Velas). These were generally considered lands that were not adequate for cereal cultivation, but where vineyards flourished. The majority of the wine production was located in the area between Queimada, Urzelina and Manadas, with grapes of the Verdelho and Terrantez castes, as well as some Bastardo, Moscatel and Alicante produced in an area that became lucrative and highly prized. Unlike the other islands, where grape vines grew on the rocky hedge-rows or around protective volcanic rocks, the grapes of S\u00e3o Jorge were grown between many of the natural species of bush and trees. Over the centuries many barrels of wine were produced in this method, and about 10,000 barrels were regularly exported or consumed locally. S\u00e3o Jorge wines were so highly esteemed that the Count of Almada, then Captain General of the Azores, created the \"S\u00e3o Jorge\" brand in order to mitigate fraudulent sales. The wine was also appreciated during the World Exposition of 1867 (in Paris, France) where it rivaled Porto wine. Unfortunately, the Oidium tukeri grape/vine disease reached the island in late 1854 and destroyed the prosperous industry. Various attempts were made to restart the wine industry, such as Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Bettencourt e \u00c1vila, the Baron Ribeiro in the area of Urzelina, and later Miguel Teixeira Soares de Sousa and Marta Pereira da Silveira, who produced wine from the Izabela caste. Meanwhile, the phylloxera disease continued to destroy many of the vineyards in the municipality of Calheta during the second half of the 18th Century, and throughout the island the disease would bring many producers to bankruptcy. The remnants of the viticulture of the island banded together around Casteletes, in Urzelina, which include Jo\u00e3o In\u00e1cio de Bettencourt Noronha, producing a new caste of wines around Urzelina and Faj\u00e3 de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o.\n\nOrange cultivation spread in the Azores around the 17th Century owing to the environmental conditions and the fertility of the lands. The export of oranges to the United Kingdom and North America was an important phase in the island's economy; about six shipments per port were annually exported, which included about 7 million (or about 994,000 kilograms) oranges. Orange orchards were located primarily in the communities of Santo Amaro, Urzelina, Ribeira Seca and in Faj\u00e3 de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3os.\n\nAnother crop to form a part of the culture of the Azores is the yam. It is widely popular and cultivated in any plot of land, and was used as an important subsistence food during the island's formative years although never becoming a major export product. It was so important that it was included in the Coat-of-Arms of Calheta, since 1694.\n\nLong before whale-watching became important, whaling was an important industry between the end of the 19th century and middle of the 20th century, where a majority of the inhabitants were tied exclusively to this economy. In strategic locations along the coast, small huts were built to watch-out for whales and give an alarm to the local hunters, who would sail out and harpoon the mammals. Later, when this hunt was prohibited, the islanders began to \"hunt\" Albacor and Bonito Tuna resulting in the creation of two processing plants in Calheta. Fishing continues to be an important part of the local economy, although whale-watching has turned into a part of local tourism.\n\nWhile cereals, vineyards and local vegetables are still grown sporadically around the island (much like the other islands of the Azores) the economy of S\u00e3o Jorge is currently dependent on the dairy industry. The local S\u00e3o Jorge cheese has been the most important part of the local economy, resulting in the establishment of an order, the Confraria do [[Queijo de S\u00e3o Jorge]], to promote the consumption and sale of this popular cheese. In addition, Uniqueijo ''Uni\u00e3o de Cooperativeas Agr\u00edcolas de Lactic\u00ednios de S\u00e3o Jorge'' (''Cooperative Agricultural Union of S\u00e3o Jorge Dairy Producers'') is the principal dairy-producer on the island.<ref name=\"GRA\">{{citation |url=http://www.azores.gov.pt/Portal/pt/entidades/pgra-gacs/noticias/Secret%C3%A1rio+Regional+dos+Recursos+Naturais+visitou+Uniqueijo.htm |title=Secret\u00e1rio Regional dos Recursos Naturais visitou Uniqueijo |access-date=4 December 2012 |date=5 December 2012 |location=Ponta Delgada (Azores), Portugal |language=Portuguese |editor=Governo Regional |publisher=Governo Regional/Presid\u00eancia dos A\u00e7ores |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819200738/http://www.azores.gov.pt/Portal/pt/entidades/pgra-gacs/noticias/Secret%C3%A1rio+Regional+dos+Recursos+Naturais+visitou+Uniqueijo.htm |archive-date=2014-08-19 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> A union of eight cooperatives, Uniqueijo is dedicated to the commercialization of the traditional S\u00e3o Jorge cheese, including new products classified under the DOP ''Denomina\u00e7\u00e3o de Origem Protegida'' (''Denomination of Protected Origin'') status.<ref name=GRA/>\n\n==Culture, tradition and tourism==\n[[File:Imperio of Topo, Azores.jpg|235px|thumb|right|An ''imp\u00e9rio'', in [[Topo (Azores)|Topo]], used in annual festivals to celebrate the Holy Spirit]]\n\n===Festivities===\nThe principal festivals popular on the island are not dissimilar to those celebrated on the islands of the archipelago. There are the festivals of Esp\u00edrito Santo that concentrate on the many imp\u00e9rios around the island, and are an important manifestation of the religious character of the islands. These festivals occur every Sunday during the seven weeks after Easter, and culminate on the seventh Sunday, Pentecosts, although some traditions vary from place-to-place. Generally, there are processions to the church and masses associated with this festival, but also include alms for the poor, the serving of a meat-soup-like broth (whose methods of preparation and serving vary from community to community) and gathering of the local citizens for conversation and/or dancing.\n\nVelas' Semana Cultural (Culture Week) is also another festivity that mixes local traditions and cultural influences from abroad. During this week expositions and presentations of local Azorean culture are mixed with local concerts, bullfights, and finally a regata between Velas and Horta, Faial during the first week of July. Meanwhile, in the village of Calheta the Festival de Julho (the July Festival) highlights four days of festivities  that brings together ethnic processions, musical comedies, theatrical presentations and local sports competitions.\n\nThe Romarias (religious pilgrimages) are a tradition of the island's Catholic communities, and strongly linked to catastrophes associated with historical earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The Romaria de Nossa Senhora de Carmo, which occurs annually in the Faj\u00e3 dos Vimes (July 16), and the Romaria  do Santo Cristo in the Faj\u00e3 da Caldeira de Santo Cristo, are popular processions where many faithful walk between religious sanctuaries, praying and in contemplation, usually stopping for mass at local churches.\n\n===Tradition===\nThe local gastronomy includes many Azorean basics, but includes local plates of fish and pork with an abundance of spices, typical of the communities visited by far eastern caravels during the Age of Exploration. Clam dishes are fairly unusual to S\u00e3o Jorge, being the only location in the archipelago where clams are discovered (usually in the Faj\u00e3 da Caldeira de Santo Cristo).  Generally there is an abundance of locals sweets for local tourists, including: coscor\u00f5es, roquilhas de aguardente, esp\u00e9cies, suspiros, olvidados, bolos de v\u00e9spera, cavacos, queijadas de leite, and a\u00e7ucareura branca. In addition, the traditional corn-bread (made from white or yellow cornmeal) is still very popular, since wheat-based breads were generally for the privileged classes of the island. The Azorean yam was also an important base of the local diet, as well as an export product.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of volcanoes in Azores]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{citation |last=Scarth |first=Alwyn |last2=Tanguy |first2=Jean-Claude |title=Volcanoes of Europe |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=England, United Kingdom |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-521754-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/volcanoesofeurop00alwy/page/243 243] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/volcanoesofeurop00alwy/page/243 }}\n* {{citation |first=Viriato |last=Madeira |title=Ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge |publisher=Revista de Estudos A\u00e7oreanos |volume=X |issue=Fasc. 1 |pages=63 |date=1 December 2003 |language=Portuguese}}\n* {{cite gvp|vnum=1802-03=|name=San Jorge}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060717012400/http://www.azores.com/azores/sao_jorge.php Azores.com, a commercial site but with abundant information on S\u00e3o Jorge Island]\n* {{in lang|en}} [http://theazoresislands.blogspot.com/search/label/S%C3%A3o%20Jorge%20Island The Azores Islands, Site with abundant information about S\u00e3o Jorge Island]\n\n{{Azores Islands}}\n\n{{Outlying territories of European countries}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sao Jorge Island}}\n[[Category:Stratovolcanoes of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Subduction volcanoes]]\n[[Category:Mountains of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Fissure vents]]\n[[Category:S\u00e3o Jorge Island| ]]\n[[Category:Islands of the Azores]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=October 2018}}\n{{Short description|island of the Azores, Portugal}}\n{{Infobox islands\n| name = S\u00e3o Jorge Island\n| native_name = Ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge\n| native_name_link =\n| native_name_lang =\n| sobriquet = <!-- or |nickname= -->\n| image_name = Ponta dos Rosais, ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.jpg\n| image_size =\n| image_caption = The island of S\u00e3o Jorge seen from the north-northwest coast along the Ponta dos Rosais, [[Rosais (Velas)|Rosais]]\n| image_alt =\n| image_map =Sao Jorge-pos.png\n| map_alt =\n| map_size =\n| map_caption = Location of the island of S\u00e3o Jorge in the archipelago of the Azores\n| pushpin_map =\n| pushpin_label =\n| pushpin_label_position =\n| pushpin_map_alt =\n| pushpin_relief =\n| pushpin_map_caption =\n| coordinates = {{coord|38|40|9|N|28|7|19|W|display=it}}\n| etymology =\n| location = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n| grid_reference = <!--UK only-->\n| archipelago =\n| waterbody =\n| total_islands =\n| major_islands =\n| area_km2 = 243.65\n| area_footnotes =\n| rank =\n| length_km = 54.07\n| length_footnotes =\n| width_km = 6.10\n| width_footnotes =\n| coastline_km =\n| coastline_footnotes =\n| elevation_m =\n| elevation_footnotes =\n| highest_mount =\n| country = [[Portugal]]\n| country_admin_divisions_title = Autonomous Region\n| country_admin_divisions = [[Azores]]\n| country_admin_divisions_title_1 =\n| country_admin_divisions_1 =\n| country_admin_divisions_title_2 =\n| country_admin_divisions_2 =\n| country_capital_type =\n| country_capital =\n| country_largest_city_type =\n| country_largest_city =\n| country_capital_and_largest_city =\n| country_largest_city_population =\n| country_leader_title =\n| country_leader_name =\n| country_area_km2 =\n| demonym = S\u00e3ojorgense;Jorgense\n| population = 9,171\n| population_as_of = 2011\n| population_footnotes =\n| population_rank =\n| population_rank_max =\n| density_km2 =\n| density_rank =\n| density_footnotes =\n| languages =\n| ethnic_groups = [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]\n| timezone1 =\n| utc_offset1 =\n| timezone1_DST =\n| utc_offset1_DST =\n| website =\n| additional_info =\n| footnotes =\n}}\n\n'''S\u00e3o Jorge''' ({{IPA-pt|s\u0250\u0303w \u02c8\u0292\u0254\u027e\u0292(\u0268)}}) is an island situated in the central group of the [[Azores]] archipelago and part of the autonomous region of [[Portugal]].  Separated from its nearest neighbors ([[Pico Island|Pico]] and [[Faial Island|Faial]] islands) by  the {{convert|15|km|mi}} Pico-S\u00e3o Jorge Channel, the central group is often referred colloquially as part of the ''Triangulo'' (\"Triangle\") group or just \"The Triangle\". S\u00e3o Jorge is a relatively long thin island with tall cliffs, whose 9500 inhabitants are concentrated on various geological debris fields (''faj\u00e3s'') along the north and south coasts; from east to west, the island is {{convert|53|km|mi}} long and, north to south, {{convert|8|km|mi}} wide: its area is {{convert|237.59|km2|mi2}}.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Matriz de N S do Rosario, Topo, Azores.jpg|235px|thumb|left|One of the earliest churches on the island of S\u00e3o Jorge, the Matriz Church of Nossa Senhora do Ros\u00e1rio, in Topo]]\nIt is unclear when the first explorers discovered the island of S\u00e3o Jorge; as part of the politics of human occupation, the Azores were populated after 1430 (probably 1439) through the initiative of [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry the Navigator]]. 23 April, known as the feast day of [[Saint George]], has been cited by historians as the reason for the island's name, although this is likely conjecture. Genovese and Catalan maps of the 14th century originally designated the long, slender island \"S\u00e3o Jorge\", a designation that was maintained by Infante D. Henrique when settlers from northern Europe began to colonize the island (around 1460, or twenty years after it was first sighted).\n\nAlthough unclear, Azorean chroniclers believe that settlement on the island concentrated around the two communities of Velas and Calheta, and developed into the interior. It was in 1460 that the construction of the first church dedicated to S\u00e3o Jorge occurred in the area of Velas, from the testaments of Infante D. Henrique. What is certain is that the island was populated by the time that Jo\u00e3o Vaz Corte Real, the Donatary-Captain of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]] ([[Terceira]]) obtained the [[captaincy]] of the island, by contract on 4 May 1483. By 1500, the settlement of Velas was elevated from villa to municipality (giving rise to the supposition that Velas was the first center on the island). By 1659, the parochial church had already undergone public restoration, that gave origin the present church in that municipality.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful adventure to the island of Flores, the Flemish nobleman  [[Willem van der Haegen]] (later known as Guilherme da Silveira) moved to the area of Topo where he established and founded a local community, in 1480. After living there for several years he died and was buried in the chapel of the Casa dos Tiagos. Topo was eventually elevated to capital of the municipality by 1510, but lost this title to Calheta on June 3, 1534. During this period, the island was wild and many of the roads difficult or non-existent between the communities, resulting in isolated villages located along the coast.  Connections between these communities developed by sea, and the better provisioned ports were likely to develop economically.  This was the case with Calheta, Urzelina and Velas; the sites, although farther from the Terceira (the towns are located on the opposite coast), were preferred way-points due to secure and sheltered ports, with good anchorage and providing many goods and services. The growth of the population was rapid, and by the mid-17th century, S\u00e3o Jorge had approximately 3000 inhabitants and three towns: Velas, Topo and Calheta. The island demonstrated a strong economic vitality:  in addition to wine, corn, and yam, it was also an important exporter of [[woad]] to Flanders and other countries in Europe.\n\nThe dynastic crisis (1580) caused by the ascension of King [[Philip II of Spain]] (King Philip I of Portugal) had consequences on the island, since gentry supported (along with those on Terceira) the pretender to the throne, D. [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]]. King D. Ant\u00f3nio reigned on the continent for about twenty days, until he was defeated at the [[Battle of Alc\u00e2ntara (1580)|Battle of Alc\u00e2ntra]], whereupon he moved his court to Terceira Island and governed in opposition until 1583. The Habsburg-supported King Phillip finally defeated his forces at sea at the [[Battle of Ponta Delgada]] between July 25\u201326, 1582, and the garrisons in S\u00e3o Jorge only capitulated to the forces of Castillo after the fall of Terceira in 1583.\n\nFollowing 1583, the island experienced a period of relative isolation, partially due to the poor quality of its ports and its limited economic importance. After the Spanish occupation, it was largely abandoned and its inhabitants were left to survive a meager existence. The island did not escape Atlantic piracy: the islanders were subject to attacks by English and French privateers in 1589 and 1590, raiders after 1590 (from the [[Barbary coast]] and lands occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]) and during the 17th and 18th centuries (mostly around Calheta). In 1625, the inhabitants of Faj\u00e3 de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o were captured by pirates and likely sold into slavery. The tranquillity around the island was also broken on September 20, 1708, when the town of Velas was attacked by French pirates under the command of [[Ren\u00e9 Duguay-Trouin]]. The population of the community resisted for twenty-four hours, but eventually the pirates made shore where they disembarked. The resistance, commanded by Sergeant-major Amaro Soares de Sousa, occurred around the village of Banquetas saving the other villages from occupation and pillaging.\n\nPeriods of local prosperity or misery occurred in the following years; there were several bad growing seasons and natural catastrophes (such as the earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tornados in 1580, 1757, 1808 and 1899) that created famines and hardships. The most famous of these eruptions began in the early morning of May 1, 1808 ([[Urzelina (volcano)|Urzelina eruption]]). Suffocating gases, as  well as carboxylic acid, were emitted from a vent along the Manadas ridge and thick greenish vaporous clouds (of chloric and sulfuric acids) rapidly spread to the plants. Eight major tremors were recorded per hour that caused widespread panic. Many of the homes, buildings and cultivatable lands were destroyed. Between 1580 and 1907, at least six significant eruptions occurred; ten people were killed during the 1580 eruption and eight in 1808. In 1850, the island's vineyards were devastated by the [[phylloxera|phylloxera plague]], which had a terrible effect on the economy until the development of the orange industry (about 1860). The island's isolation ended after the completion of the ports of Velas and Calheta.\n\nDuring the Portuguese [[Liberal Wars|Civil War]], Liberalist forces were stationed on the island after May 10, 1831.  Generally, the island's residents have lived for many years in isolation, interrupted by rare visits from the authorities, commercial boats from the local islands, and the occasional nobleman who has come to contemplate the local scenery.\n\nWith the inauguration of its ports, and the [[S\u00e3o Jorge Airport|airport/aerodrome]] (April 23, 1982) commercial ventures have grown (especially the export of the local cheese), the expansion of animal husbandry, the fisheries and a small crafts industry.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Physical geography ===\n[[File:Ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge, A\u00e7ores, Portugal, costa Sul.JPG|235px|thumb|right|The southern coast of S\u00e3o Jorge, with its rugged cliffs along the southeastern part of Calheta]]\nUnique among the islands of Azores, S\u00e3o Jorge is uncharacteristically  long and slender and susceptible to ocean erosion. The island was built on fissural volcanism associated with the plate tectonics of the mid-Atlantic Ridge and a transform fault that extends from the Ridge to the island of S\u00e3o Miguel (referred to as the S\u00e3o Jorge Fault). Through successive fissural eruptions the island was built-up: the only remnants of these forces are the line of volcanic cones that extend along the central ridge (approximately 700 metres in altitude).\n\nThe island was built-up from successive morphological structures of progressively younger materials, these include:\n\n* [[Topo Volcanic Complex]] - predominantly built of basalt,  [[hawaiite]],  and mugearite lavas and pyroclastic deposits and Strombolian cinder cones. Materials in this formation were produced are about 600,000 years in age.\n* Rosais Volcanic Complex - consisting of the northeastern portion of the island, with a similar composition to those materials in Topo.\n* Manadas Volcanic Complex - most recent formation composed of Strombolian cones and two Surtseyan cones (Morro de Lemos and Morro Velho), as well as craters and tuff rings resulting from [[Phreatomagmatic]] activity.\n\nThe island is 55&nbsp;km in length from the Ponta dos Rosais until the Topo Islet and a maximum width between Faj\u00e3 das Pontas and Portinho da Calheta (approximately  7&nbsp;km). The highest point is [[Pico da Esperan\u00e7a]] at 1,053&nbsp;meters.  The island has an area of 246&nbsp;km\u00b2, with an obvious difference in the relief between the western and eastern portions of the island: the western coast is ringed with cliffs, while the eastern coast is morphologically smoother. Similarly, the contrast between the northern and southern coasts are obvious; apart from several deltas (faj\u00e3s) on both coasts, the northern coast has sharp cliffs, while the southern coast is less inclined.  The majority of the cliffs in the northeast are between 300 and 400 m with severe slopes (between 45\u00b0 and 55\u00b0). In this area, many of the faj\u00e3s, some composed of lavas (Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, Faj\u00e3 das Pontas and Faj\u00e3 da Ribeira da Areia) and others dendritic (Faj\u00e3 de Jo\u00e3o Dias and Faj\u00e3 da Penedia), are visible. In the southwest the cliffs are approximately 100m in height and most settlements are located along the lava deltas, such as the Faj\u00e3 das  Velas, Faj\u00e3 da Queimada, Faj\u00e3  Grande and Faj\u00e3 da Calheta.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBeing located in the middle  of the Atlantic Ocean, in an area of high pressures the island benefits  from the influence of the Gulf Stream that maintains water temperatures  between 17 and 23&nbsp;\u00b0C, and atmospheric temperatures hovering between 13 and 24&nbsp;\u00b0C. Annual humidity hovers around 75% and the level of precipitation has molded the physical appearance of the island.\n\n=== Human geography ===\n[[File:Faj\u00e3 de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, vista, Calheta, S\u00e3o Jorge, A\u00e7ores.JPG|235ppx|thumb|Faj\u00e3 de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o]]\n[[File:24 ilha de s\u00e3o jorge, a\u00e7ores1.jpg|thumb|Faj\u00e3 de Santo Cristo]]\nThe geomorphology of the island (its high cliffs, rough central plateaus and scattered faj\u00e3s) resulted in the concentration of human settlements along the coast. Historically these communities were linked by coastal ports since the trails in the interior were barely transitable. Consequently, communities were isolated from one another necessitating local solutions to common problems and building local ties between families. Velas, Calheta and Topo developed partially due to well developed ports and local economies, in addition to administrative necessity and central positions. The settlements developed with immigration from Spain and Flanders, principally by settlers brought by the \u00c1vilas and by Willem van de Hagen.\n\nAdministratively, S\u00e3o Jorge is divided into two municipalities:  [[Calheta (Azores)|Calheta]] in the east with five parishes and [[Velas]] in the west with six parishes. The rural population is basically aligned along the lines of communication divided by areas of unpopulated pastureland between localities.\n\n== Economy ==\nAfter a period of small subsistence agriculture, the local economy began to concentrate on a few chief exports: initially, lichen ('''''[[Roccella tinctoria]]''''') and woad ('''''[[Isatis tinctoria]]'''''), later the introduction of wheat and corn crops. Woad was one of the most important exports from S\u00e3o Jorge and the Azores; it was initially introduced by Willem van der Hagen around 1490, and exported primarily to his countrymen in Flanders. Both woad and lichen were very popular in central Europe as a dye.\n\nThese exports were later superseded by grapes and wine after 1571 and endured for the next three centuries. It was first disseminated along the southern coast, owing to the fertile soils, and adapted well to many of the faj\u00e3s of Calheta (including Faj\u00e3 dos Vimes, Faj\u00e3 de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, and Faj\u00e3 Grande), as well as the areas between Ribeira do Almeirda and the parish of Queimadas (in Velas). These were generally considered lands that were not adequate for cereal cultivation, but where vineyards flourished. The majority of the wine production was located in the area between Queimada, Urzelina and Manadas, with grapes of the Verdelho and Terrantez castes, as well as some Bastardo, Moscatel and Alicante produced in an area that became lucrative and highly prized. Unlike the other islands, where grape vines grew on the rocky hedge-rows or around protective volcanic rocks, the grapes of S\u00e3o Jorge were grown between many of the natural species of bush and trees. Over the centuries many barrels of wine were produced in this method, and about 10,000 barrels were regularly exported or consumed locally. S\u00e3o Jorge wines were so highly esteemed that the Count of Almada, then Captain General of the Azores, created the \"S\u00e3o Jorge\" brand in order to mitigate fraudulent sales. The wine was also appreciated during the World Exposition of 1867 (in Paris, France) where it rivaled Porto wine. Unfortunately, the Oidium tukeri grape/vine disease reached the island in late 1854 and destroyed the prosperous industry. Various attempts were made to restart the wine industry, such as Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Bettencourt e \u00c1vila, the Baron Ribeiro in the area of Urzelina, and later Miguel Teixeira Soares de Sousa and Marta Pereira da Silveira, who produced wine from the Izabela caste. Meanwhile, the Filoxera disease continue to destroy many of the vineyards in the municipality of Calheta during the second half of the 18th Century, and throughout the island the disease would bring many producers to bankruptcy. The remnants of the viticulture of the island banded together around Casteletes, in Urzelina, which include Jo\u00e3o In\u00e1cio de Bettencourt Noronha, producing a new caste of wines around Urzelina and Faj\u00e3 de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o.\n\nOrange cultivation spread in the Azores around the 17th Century owing to the environmental conditions and the fertility of the lands. The export of oranges to the United Kingdom and North America was an important phase in the island's economy; about six shipments per port were annually exported, which included about 7 million (or about 994,000 kilograms) oranges. Orange orchards were located primarily in the communities of Santo Amaro, Urzelina, Ribeira Seca and in Faj\u00e3 de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3os.\n\nAnother crop to form a part of the culture of the Azores is the yam. It is widely popular and cultivated in any plot of land, and was used as an important subsistence food during the island's formative years although never becoming a major export product. It was so important that it was included in the Coat-of-Arms of Calheta, since 1694.\n\nLong before whale-watching became important, whaling was an important industry between the end of the 19th century and middle of the 20th century, where a majority of the inhabitants were tied exclusively to this economy. In strategic locations along the coast, small huts were built to watch-out for whales and give an alarm to the local hunters, who would sail out and harpoon the mammals. Later, when this hunt was prohibited, the islanders began to \"hunt\" Albacor and Bonito Tuna resulting in the creation of two processing plants in Calheta. Fishing continues to be an important part of the local economy, although whale-watching has turned into a part of local tourism.\n\nWhile cereals, vineyards and local vegetables are still grown sporadically around the island (much like the other islands of the Azores) the economy of S\u00e3o Jorge is currently dependent on the dairy industry. The local S\u00e3o Jorge cheese has been the most important part of the local economy, resulting in the establishment of an order, the Confraria do [[Queijo de S\u00e3o Jorge]], to promote the consumption and sale of this popular cheese. In addition, Uniqueijo ''Uni\u00e3o de Cooperativeas Agr\u00edcolas de Lactic\u00ednios de S\u00e3o Jorge'' (''Cooperative Agricultural Union of S\u00e3o Jorge Dairy Producers'') is the principal dairy-producer on the island.<ref name=\"GRA\">{{citation |url=http://www.azores.gov.pt/Portal/pt/entidades/pgra-gacs/noticias/Secret%C3%A1rio+Regional+dos+Recursos+Naturais+visitou+Uniqueijo.htm |title=Secret\u00e1rio Regional dos Recursos Naturais visitou Uniqueijo |access-date=4 December 2012 |date=5 December 2012 |location=Ponta Delgada (Azores), Portugal |language=Portuguese |editor=Governo Regional |publisher=Governo Regional/Presid\u00eancia dos A\u00e7ores |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819200738/http://www.azores.gov.pt/Portal/pt/entidades/pgra-gacs/noticias/Secret%C3%A1rio+Regional+dos+Recursos+Naturais+visitou+Uniqueijo.htm |archive-date=2014-08-19 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> A union of eight cooperatives, Uniqueijo is dedicated to the commercialization of the traditional S\u00e3o Jorge cheese, including new products classified under the DOP ''Denomina\u00e7\u00e3o de Origem Protegida'' (''Denomination of Protected Origin'') status.<ref name=GRA/>\n\n==Culture, tradition and tourism==\n[[File:Imperio of Topo, Azores.jpg|235px|thumb|right|An ''imp\u00e9rio'', in [[Topo (Azores)|Topo]], used in annual festivals to celebrate the Holy Spirit]]\n\n===Festivities===\nThe principal festivals popular on the island are not dissimilar to those celebrated on the islands of the archipelago. There are the festivals of Esp\u00edrito Santo that concentrate on the many imp\u00e9rios around the island, and are an important manifestation of the religious character of the islands. These festivals occur every Sunday during the seven weeks after Easter, and culminate on the seventh Sunday, Pentecosts, although some traditions vary from place-to-place. Generally, there are processions to the church and masses associated with this festival, but also include alms for the poor, the serving of a meat-soup-like broth (whose methods of preparation and serving vary from community to community) and gathering of the local citizens for conversation and/or dancing.\n\nVelas' Semana Cultural (Culture Week) is also another festivity that mixes local traditions and cultural influences from abroad. During this week expositions and presentations of local Azorean culture are mixed with local concerts, bullfights, and finally a regata between Velas and Horta, Faial during the first week of July. Meanwhile, in the village of Calheta the Festival de Julho (the July Festival) highlights four days of festivities  that brings together ethnic processions, musical comedies, theatrical presentations and local sports competitions.\n\nThe Romarias (religious pilgrimages) are a tradition of the island's Catholic communities, and strongly linked to catastrophes associated with historical earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The Romaria de Nossa Senhora de Carmo, which occurs annually in the Faj\u00e3 dos Vimes (July 16), and the Romaria  do Santo Cristo in the Faj\u00e3 da Caldeira de Santo Cristo, are popular processions where many faithful walk between religious sanctuaries, praying and in contemplation, usually stopping for mass at local churches.\n\n===Tradition===\nThe local gastronomy includes many Azorean basics, but includes local plates of fish and pork with an abundance of spices, typical of the communities visited by far eastern caravels during the Age of Exploration. Clam dishes are fairly unusual to S\u00e3o Jorge, being the only location in the archipelago where clams are discovered (usually in the Faj\u00e3 da Caldeira de Santo Cristo).  Generally there is an abundance of locals sweets for local tourists, including: coscor\u00f5es, roquilhas de aguardente, esp\u00e9cies, suspiros, olvidados, bolos de v\u00e9spera, cavacos, queijadas de leite, and a\u00e7ucareura branca. In addition, the traditional corn-bread (made from white or yellow cornmeal) is still very popular, since wheat-based breads were generally for the privileged classes of the island. The Azorean yam was also an important base of the local diet, as well as an export product.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of volcanoes in Azores]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{citation |last=Scarth |first=Alwyn |last2=Tanguy |first2=Jean-Claude |title=Volcanoes of Europe |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=England, United Kingdom |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-521754-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/volcanoesofeurop00alwy/page/243 243] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/volcanoesofeurop00alwy/page/243 }}\n* {{citation |first=Viriato |last=Madeira |title=Ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge |publisher=Revista de Estudos A\u00e7oreanos |volume=X |issue=Fasc. 1 |pages=63 |date=1 December 2003 |language=Portuguese}}\n* {{cite gvp|vnum=1802-03=|name=San Jorge}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060717012400/http://www.azores.com/azores/sao_jorge.php Azores.com, a commercial site but with abundant information on S\u00e3o Jorge Island]\n* {{in lang|en}} [http://theazoresislands.blogspot.com/search/label/S%C3%A3o%20Jorge%20Island The Azores Islands, Site with abundant information about S\u00e3o Jorge Island]\n\n{{Azores Islands}}\n\n{{Outlying territories of European countries}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sao Jorge Island}}\n[[Category:Stratovolcanoes of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Subduction volcanoes]]\n[[Category:Mountains of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Fissure vents]]\n[[Category:S\u00e3o Jorge Island| ]]\n[[Category:Islands of the Azores]]\n", "name_user": "Camboxer", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEconomy:spelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Jorge_Island"}

McFarland, 2005.]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn '''Ferdinand Rudolph von Grof\u00e9''', in [[New York City]], Grof\u00e9 came by his extensive musical interests naturally. His family had four generations of [[classical music]]ians. His father, Emil von Grof\u00e9, was a [[baritone]] who sang mainly light opera; his mother, Elsa Johanna Bierlich von Grof\u00e9, a professional [[cellist]], was also a versatile music teacher who taught Ferde to play the [[violin]] and [[piano]]. Elsa's father, Bernardt Bierlich, was a cellist in the [[Metropolitan Opera]] Orchestra in New York and Elsa's brother, Julius Bierlich, was first violinist and [[concertmaster]] of the Los Angeles Symphony.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=m3S7PIxe0mwC&pg=PA1204&lpg=PA1204&dq=bernardt+bierlich+obituary&source=bl&ots=KWcIvULbV1&sig=ACfU3U3PjNHbCWnf8eH0L822BTqp77k8aA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjiha71-rDnAhVqUt8KHRT-C5gQ6AEwAnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=bernardt%20bierlich%20obituary&f=false Green's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers.

Ferde became proficient on a wide range of instruments including piano (his favored instrument), violin, viola (he became a violist in the LA Symphony), [[baritone horn]], [[alto horn]] and [[cornet]]. This command of musical instruments and composition gave Ferde the foundation to become, first an arranger of other composers' music, and then a composer in his own right.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ferde Grof\u00e9 - American Composer |url= https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferde-Grofe |date= |year=2020 |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |location= |id= }}</ref>\n\nGrof\u00e9 left home at age 14 and variously worked as a milkman, truck driver, usher, newsboy, elevator operator, helper in a book bindery, iron factory worker, and played in a [[piano bar]] for two dollars a night and as an [[accompanist]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.naxos.com/person/Ferde_Grof%C3%A9/26084.htm |title=Ferde Grof\u00e9 |author=<!--Unknown--> |date= |website=Naxos.com |publisher= |access-date=February 2, 2020 |quote=}}</ref> He continued studying piano and violin.

He served as Whiteman's chief arranger from 1920 to 1932. He made hundreds of arrangements of popular songs, Broadway show music, and tunes of all types for Whiteman.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rayno |first=Don |authorlink=Don Rayno |date=2003 |title=Paul Whiteman: Pioneer in American Music, Volume One 1890-1930}}</ref>\n\nGrof\u00e9's most memorable arrangement is that of [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which established Grof\u00e9's reputation among jazz musicians. Grof\u00e9 took what Gershwin had written for two pianos and orchestrated it for Whiteman's jazz orchestra. He transformed Gershwin's musical canvas with the colors and many of the creative touches for which it is so well known. He went on to create two more arrangements of the piece in later years.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Rhapsody in Blue |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rhapsody-in-Blue-by-Gershwin |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= |year=2020 |publisher= |location= |id= }}</ref> Grof\u00e9's 1942 orchestration for full orchestra of ''Rhapsody in Blue'' is the one most frequently heard today. In 1928, Gershwin wrote a letter to [[ASCAP]] complaining that Grof\u00e9 had listed himself as a composer of ''Rhapsody in Blue''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|date=February 13, 1989|title=They Got America Humming: A Celebration|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/13/arts/they-got-america-humming-a-celebration.html|accessdate=March 23, 2009}}</ref>  The dispute was settled, with Grof\u00e9 receiving a portion of the music royalties for the piece.

The \"On the Trail\" segment of ''Grand Canyon Suite'' was used for many years as the \"musical signature\" for radio and television programs sponsored by [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] cigarettes, beginning with their 1933 radio program featuring Grof\u00e9 and his orchestra and concluding with ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' (1951\u201357). Jon Hendricks wrote lyrics for ''On the Trail'', and the song was recorded for Hendricks' album ''To Tell the Truth'' (1975). The piano version sheet music of the suite includes lyrics to the central section of \"On the Trail\" by songwriter [[Gus Kahn]].\n\nSeveral times he conducted orchestral programs in New York's [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref>''New York Times'', \"Orchestra at Carnegie Hall meets enthusiastic crowd\", January 10, 1937.</ref><ref>''New York Times'', \"Grof\u00e9 Guest Conductor at Benefit Concert for 'Free Milk Fund for Babies', March 25, 1938.</ref>\n\nIn January 1933 the premiere of his ''Tabloid Suite'', an orchestral suite in 4 movements, was presented in Carnegie Hall.<ref>''New York Times'', January 26, 1933.</ref> In 1937, he conducted a concert tribute to George Gershwin at [[Lewisohn Stadium]].

In 1944, he was a panelist on ''A Song Is Born'' radio show, judging the works of unknown composers. Before that time he had served several times as judge or co-judge in musical contests. Grof\u00e9 was later employed as a [[conducting|conductor]] and faculty member at the [[Juilliard School|Juilliard School of Music]] where he taught [[orchestration]].\n\n==Grof\u00e9's compositions==\nIn addition to being an arranger, Grof\u00e9 was also a composer in his own right. While still with Whiteman, in 1926, he wrote ''[[Mississippi Suite]]'', which Whiteman recorded in shortened format in 1927. He wrote a number of other pieces, including a theme for the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and suites for [[Niagara Falls]] and the [[Hudson River]]. Possibly as a result of his World's Fair theme, 13 October 1940 was designated Ferde Grof\u00e9 Day at the American pavilion of the World's Fair.<ref>''New York Times'', 14 October 1940</ref>  Grof\u00e9 conducted his ''[[Niagara Falls Suite]]'' as part of the ceremony marking the opening of the first stage of the [[Niagara Falls|Niagara Falls Power Generation]] project.<ref>''New York Times'', 7 February 1961</ref>\n\nOther notable compositions by Grof\u00e9 were the ''[[Death Valley Suite]]'' and a music production about [[Mark Twain]]. ''Death Valley Suite'' is a short symphonic suite written by Grof\u00e9 in 1949, depicting the westward travels of pioneers through the 'harsh lands' of [[Death Valley]] in California. Grof\u00e9 was commissioned by the Death Valley 49ers, a nonprofit organization devoted to preserving pioneering and mining history of the [[Death Valley]] region encompassing Death Valley National Monument (now [[Death Valley National Park]]) and surrounding area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deathvalley49ers.org/|title=About Us|website=deathvalley49ers.org/|publisher=Death Valley 49ers|last1=49ers|first1=Death Valley|accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref> The composition and music was part of a pageant performed on December 3, 1949 celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 49ers who came by way of Death Valley in search of gold and other riches and celebration of the [[California]] state centennial (1850\u20131950).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grofe|first1=Ferde|title=Ferde Grofe|date=1949|publisher=Grofe and State of California|url=http://www.ferde-grofe.net/scores/Desert_Water_Hole_Preview.pdf|access-date=2014-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092151/http://www.ferde-grofe.net/scores/Desert_Water_Hole_Preview.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The 1949 pageant setting was outdoors at Desolation Canyon in Death Valley.

The earlier ''[[Mississippi Suite]]'' along with the later ''Death Valley Suite'' are occasionally performed and are recorded. Grof\u00e9 conducted the [[Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra]] in his ''Grand Canyon Suite'' and his piano concerto (with pianist [[Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Sanrom\u00e1]]) for [[Everest Records]] in 1960; the recording was digitally remastered and issued on CD in 1997.\n\nIn 1958, [[Walt Disney]] released a live-action, short subject film of the [[Grand Canyon]] using the Grand Canyon Suite music. The thirty-minute Technicolor and [[CinemaScope]] film, entitled ''[[Grand Canyon (1958 film)]]'', used no actors or dialogue, simply shots of the Grand Canyon itself and several animals around the area, all shown with Grof\u00e9's music accompanying the visuals.

Today, the \"Grand Canyon Suite's\" third movement, \"On the Trail,\" can be heard playing as the [[Disneyland Railroad]] passes the Grand Canyon sections of the \"Grand Circle Tour\" of [[Disneyland]].\n\n==Films==\nHe began his second career as composer of [[film score]]s in 1930, when he provided arrangements (and perhaps portions of the score) for the film ''[[King of Jazz]]''.<ref>''New York Times'', \"The King of Jazz, score by Ferde Grof\u00e9\", 12 January 1930</ref>  Published data for this movie do not list Grof\u00e9 as the score's composer, however.<ref>''[[King of Jazz]]'', Wikipedia entry</ref>  He is also credited with the film score for the 1930 movie ''[[Redemption (1930 film)|Redemption]]''.<ref>''New York Times'', 3 May 1930</ref>\n\nA review for the 1944 Joseph Lewis film ''[[Minstrel Man (film)|Minstrel Man]]'' stated \"the music, scored by Ferde Grof\u00e9, is an outstanding item.\"<ref>''New York Times'', date not available</ref> Grof\u00e9 was nominated, along with Leo Erdody, for an [[Academy Award]] in the category \"Scoring of a Musical Picture\" for this film.\n\nThe score he composed for ''[[Rocketship X-M]]'' (1950) was the first science fiction movie to feature the electronic instrument known as the [[theremin]].\n\nHis other original film scores included ''[[Early to Bed (1928 film)|Early to Bed]]'' (1928), ''[[Diamond Jim]]'' (1935), ''[[Time Out of Mind (1947 film)|Time Out of Mind]]'' (1947) and ''[[The Return of Jesse James]]'' (1950).\n\n==Personal life==\nAlthough he spent the first half of his life living in [[New Jersey]] and working in and around New York City, by 1945 he had moved to Los Angeles full-time. In 1945 he also sold his [[Teaneck, New Jersey]], home.<ref>''New York Times'', 1945</ref>\n\nGrof\u00e9 married his first wife, Mildred Grizzelle, a soprano singer, in 1916, and divorced in 1928. In May 1951, he filed for divorce in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], from his second wife, Ruth, whom he had married in 1929. The day after the divorce was granted, he married his third wife, Anna May Lampton (13 January 1952).<ref>''New York Times'', 13 January 1952</ref>\n\n==Death==\nFerde Grof\u00e9 died in [[Santa Monica, California]], on April 3, 1972, aged 80, and was buried in the Mausoleum of the Golden West at the Inglewood Park Cemetery in [[Inglewood, California]]. He left four children, Ferdinand Rudolf Jr., Anne, Robert, and Delight, all of the Los Angeles area.<ref>Obituary, ''New York Times'', April 4, 1972.</ref>\n\n== Compositions==\nGrof\u00e9 composed a

Ferde became proficient on a wide range of instruments including piano (his favored instrument), violin, viola (he became a violist in the LA Symphony), [[baritone horn]], [[alto horn]] and [[cornet]].

Grof\u00e9 took what Gershwin had written for two pianos and orchestrated it for Whiteman's jazz orchestra.

Jon Hendricks wrote lyrics for ''On the Trail'', and the song was recorded for Hendricks' album ''To Tell the Truth'' (1975).

In 1944, he was a panelist on ''A Song Is Born'' radio show, judging the works of unknown composers. Before that time he had served several times as judge or co-judge in musical contests. Grof\u00e9 was later employed as a [[conducting|conductor]] and faculty member at the [[Juilliard School|Juilliard School of Music]] where he taught [[orchestration]].\n\n==Grof\u00e9's compositions==\nIn addition to being an arranger, Grof\u00e9 was also a composer in his own right. While still with Whiteman, in 1926, he wrote ''[[Mississippi Suite]]'', which Whiteman recorded in shortened format in 1927. He wrote a number of other pieces, including a theme for the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and suites for [[Niagara Falls]] and the [[Hudson River]]. Possibly as a result of his World's Fair theme, 13 October 1940 was designated Ferde Grof\u00e9 Day at the American pavilion of the World's Fair.<ref>''New York Times'', 14 October 1940</ref>  Grof\u00e9 conducted his ''[[Niagara Falls Suite]]'' as part of the ceremony marking the opening of the first stage of the [[Niagara Falls|Niagara Falls Power Generation]] project.<ref>''New York Times'', 7 February 1961</ref>\n\nOther notable compositions by Grof\u00e9 were the ''[[Death Valley Suite]]'' and a music production about [[Mark Twain]]. ''Death Valley Suite'' is a short symphonic suite written by Grof\u00e9 in 1949, depicting the westward travels of pioneers through the 'harsh lands' of [[Death Valley]] in California. Grof\u00e9 was commissioned by the Death Valley 49ers, a nonprofit organization devoted to preserving pioneering and mining history of the [[Death Valley]] region encompassing Death Valley National Monument (now [[Death Valley National Park]]) and surrounding area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deathvalley49ers.org/|title=About Us|website=deathvalley49ers.org/|publisher=Death Valley 49ers|last1=49ers|first1=Death Valley|accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref> The composition and music was part of a pageant performed on December 3, 1949 celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 49ers who came by way of Death Valley in search of gold and other riches and celebration of the [[California]] state centennial (1850\u20131950).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grofe|first1=Ferde|title=Ferde Grofe|date=1949|publisher=Grofe and State of California|url=http://www.ferde-grofe.net/scores/Desert_Water_Hole_Preview.pdf|access-date=2014-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092151/http://www.ferde-grofe.net/scores/Desert_Water_Hole_Preview.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The 1949 pageant setting was outdoors at Desolation Canyon in Death Valley.

The earlier ''[[Mississippi Suite]]'' along with the later ''Death Valley Suite'' are occasionally performed and are recorded. Grof\u00e9 conducted the [[Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra]] in his ''Grand Canyon Suite'' and his piano concerto (with pianist [[Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Sanrom\u00e1]]) for [[Everest Records]] in 1960; the recording was digitally remastered and issued on CD in 1997.\n\nIn 1958, [[Walt Disney]] released a live-action, short subject film of the [[Grand Canyon]] using the Grand Canyon Suite music. The thirty-minute Technicolor and [[CinemaScope]] film, entitled ''[[Grand Canyon (1958 film)]]'', used no actors or dialogue, simply shots of the Grand Canyon itself and several animals around the area, all shown with Grof\u00e9's music accompanying the visuals. The short won an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Subject,<ref>{{Citation|last=Algar|first=James|title=Grand Canyon|date=1958-12-17|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051677/awards|accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref> and was shown as a featurette accompanying Disney's 1959 ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''.

He was named after both grandfathers: '''Joachim''' II Hector and '''[[Frederick II of Legnica|Frederick]]''' II of [[Legnica]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Youth===\nDuring his father's reign, Joachim Frederick wasn't included in the government of the Duchy of Brzeg. He spent seven years at the court of his maternal uncle, [[John George, Elector of Brandenburg|John George]], since 1571 [[Elector of Brandenburg]]. As a representative of Brandenburg, Joachim Frederick appeared at the coronation of [[Henry III of France|Henry of France]] as King of Poland in 1574, and in the coronation of King [[Rudolf II]] in Rome on 27 October 1575. Two years later, he received a dowry of 15,000 [[Thaler|taler]]s secured for the town of [[W\u0105sosz]] on occasion of his marriage with Anna Maria of Anhalt.\n\n===Duke of O\u0142awa-Wo\u0142\u00f3w===\nGeorge II died on 7 May 1586. Joachim Frederick, together with his younger brother John George took the government of [[O\u0142awa]] (where they settled his residence) and [[Wo\u0142\u00f3w]] but not in [[Brzeg]], who was given by the late Duke to his widow Barbara of Brandenburg as [[dower]]. When John George died on 6 July 1592 without surviving issue, Joachim Frederick became in the sole ruler of all their domains, except the two main cities of Brzeg (dower of his mother Barbara) and O\u0142awa (dower of his sister-in-law Anna of W\u00fcrttemberg, widow of John George). However, two events changed this situation: on 24 October 1594 Anna remarried with Duke [[Frederick IV of Legnica]] (and in consequence lost her dower lands), followed two months later by the death of Barbara, on 2 January 1595. Joachim Frederick reunited all the paternal heritage under his rule.\n\nHis Duchy also expanded thanks of the districts of [[Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w]] and [[Srebrna G\u00f3ra, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Srebrna G\u00f3ra]], who had rich deposits of precious metals. Also, in 1596 he inherited Legnica after the death of Duke Frederick IV without surviving issue.\n\n===Government and functions===\nJoachim Frederick was an efficient ruler. He ratified the former privileges of his cities and supported the development of crafts. In O\u0142awa he built fortifications and opened mints, thanks to the mines of Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w and Srebrna G\u00f3ra. Also, he established a pension for the unmarried daughter of the deposed [[Henry XI of Legnica]].\n\nThanks to his family connections and his good relations with the [[Prague]] court, he held honorable functions. Since 1585 he held the dignity of Lutheran Provost of the Chapter of [[Magdeburg]], and in 1588 was appointed the General Commander of the Regular Army of Silesia.\n\n===Death===\nJoachim Frederick died on 25 March 1602 in Brzeg. On 7 May, he was buried in the local church of St. Hedwig. Under his will, wrote on 16 December 1595, he gave the district of O\u0142awa to his wife as dower.\n\nHe was succeeded by his two surviving sons, John Christian and George Rudolf. Since both are minors at that time, the regency was exercised, firstly by their mother Anna Maria, and after her death in 1605, by their uncle [[Charles II, Duke of M\u00fcnsterberg-Oels|Charles II of Pod\u011bbrady]], Duke of [[Zi\u0119bice]]-[[Ole\u015bnica]].\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nIn [[Brzeg]] on 19 May 1577, Joachim Frederick married with [[Anna Maria of Anhalt|Anna Maria]] (b. Zerbst, 13 June 1561 - d. Brzeg, 14 November 1605), daughter of [[Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt]]. They had six children:\n#George Ernest (b. O\u0142awa, 29 August 1589 \u2013 d. O\u0142awa, 6 November 1589).\n#[[John Christian of Brieg|John Christian]] (b. O\u0142awa, 28 August 1591 \u2013 d. Ostr\u00f3da, 25 December 1639).\n#Barbara Agnes (b.

He was named after both grandfathers: '''Joachim''' II Hector and '''[[Frederick II of Legnica|Frederick]]''' II of [[Legnica]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Youth===\nDuring his father's reign, Joachim Frederick wasn't included in the government of the Duchy of Brzeg. He spent seven years at the court of his maternal uncle, [[John George, Elector of Brandenburg|John George]], since 1571 [[Elector of Brandenburg]]. As a representative of Brandenburg, Joachim Frederick appeared at the coronation of [[Henry III of France|Henry of France]] as King of Poland in 1574, and in the coronation of King [[Rudolf II]] in Rome on 27 October 1575. Two years later, he received a dowry of 15,000 [[Thaler|taler]]s secured for the town of [[W\u0105sosz]] on occasion of his marriage with Anna Maria of Anhalt.\n\n===Duke of O\u0142awa-Wo\u0142\u00f3w===\nGeorge II died on 7 May 1586. Joachim Frederick, together with his younger brother John George took the government of [[O\u0142awa]] (where they settled his residence) and [[Wo\u0142\u00f3w]] but not in [[Brzeg]], who was given by the late Duke to his widow Barbara of Brandenburg as [[dower]]. When John George died on 6 July 1592 without surviving issue, Joachim Frederick became in the sole ruler of all their domains, except the two main cities of Brzeg (dower of his mother Barbara) and O\u0142awa (dower of his sister-in-law Anna of W\u00fcrttemberg, widow of John George). However, two events changed this situation: on 24 October 1594 Anna remarried with Duke [[Frederick IV of Legnica]] (and in consequence lost her dower lands), followed two months later by the death of Barbara, on 2 January 1595. Joachim Frederick reunited all the paternal heritage under his rule.\n\nHis Duchy also expanded thanks of the districts of [[Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w]] and [[Srebrna G\u00f3ra, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Srebrna G\u00f3ra]], who had rich deposits of precious metals. Also, in 1596 he inherited Legnica after the death of Duke Frederick IV without surviving issue.\n\n===Government and functions===\nJoachim Frederick was an efficient ruler. He ratified the former privileges of his cities and supported the development of crafts. In O\u0142awa he built fortifications and opened mints, thanks to the mines of Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w and Srebrna G\u00f3ra. Also, he established a pension for the unmarried daughter of the deposed [[Henry XI of Legnica]].\n\nThanks to his family connections and his good relations with the [[Prague]] court, he held honorable functions. Since 1585 he held the dignity of Lutheran Provost of the Chapter of [[Magdeburg]], and in 1588 was appointed the General Commander of the Regular Army of Silesia.\n\n===Death===\nJoachim Frederick died on 25 March 1602 in Brzeg. On 7 May, he was buried in the local church of St. Hedwig. Under his will, wrote on 16 December 1595, he gave the district of O\u0142awa to his wife as dower.\n\nHe was succeeded by his two surviving sons, John Christian and George Rudolf. Since both are minors at that time, the regency was exercised, firstly by their mother Anna Maria, and after her death in 1605, by their uncle [[Charles II, Duke of M\u00fcnsterberg-Oels|Charles II of Pod\u011bbrady]], Duke of [[Zi\u0119bice]]-[[Ole\u015bnica]].\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nIn [[Brzeg]] on 19 May 1577, Joachim Frederick married with [[Anna Maria of Anhalt|Anna Maria]] (b. Zerbst, 13 June 1561 - d. Brzeg, 14 November 1605), daughter of [[Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt]]. They had six children:\n#George Ernest (b. O\u0142awa, 29 August 1589 \u2013 d.
