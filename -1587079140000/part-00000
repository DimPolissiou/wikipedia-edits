{"title_page": "Chinese honorifics", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=July 2015}}{{Technical|date=March 2019}}\n'''Chinese honorifics''' and honorific language ({{Ruby|\u656c\u8fad|j\u00ecngc\u00ed}}\uff0c{{Ruby|\u8b19\u8fad|qi\u0101nc\u00ed}}\uff0c{{Ruby|\u5a49\u8fad|w\u01cenc\u00ed}}\uff0c{{Ruby|\u5ba2\u5957\u8a9e|k\u00e8t\u00e0oy\u01d4}}\uff0c{{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}}) are words, word constructs, and expressions in the Chinese language that convey self-deprecation, social respect, politeness, or deference. Once ubiquitously employed in ancient China, a large percent has fallen out of use in the contemporary Chinese lexicon. The promotion of [[Written vernacular Chinese|vernacular Chinese]] during the [[New Culture Movement]] (\u65b0\u6587\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8 or \u4e94\u56db\u6587\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8) of the 1910s and 1920s in China further hastened the demise of a large body of Chinese honorifics previously preserved in the vocabulary and grammar of [[Classical Chinese]].  \n\nAlthough Chinese honorifics have simplified to a large degree, contemporary Chinese still retains a sizable set of honorifics. Many of the classical constructs are also occasionally employed by contemporary speakers to convey formality, humility, politeness or respect. Usage of classical Chinese honorifics is also found frequently in contemporary Chinese literature and television or cinematic productions that are set in the historical periods. Honorific language in Chinese is achieved by using honorific or beautifying alternatives, prefixing or suffixing a word with a polite complement, or by dropping casual-sounding words. In general, language referring to oneself exhibits [[self-deprecating]] humbleness - called {{Ruby|\u8b19\u8a9e|qi\u0101ny\u016d}} ''(\"humble language\"''), while language referring to others shows approval and respect - called {{Ruby|\u656c\u8a9e|j\u00ecngy\u01d4}} (''\"respectful language\"''). Other types of honorific language include {{Ruby|\u5a49\u8a9e|w\u01ceny\u016d}} (''\"indirect language\"''), {{Ruby|\u5ba2\u5957\u8a9e|k\u00e8t\u00e0oy\u01d4}} (''\"courteous language\"''), and {{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}} (''\"elegant language\"'') that are often used to convey a sense of respect, courtesy, or elegance. \n\nBecause of its official status as the common language of China, [[Mandarin Chinese]] is used herein synonymously with the term \"contemporary Chinese\". Variations in usage and grammar exist in the numerous modern [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialects]].\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe term \u77e5\u66f8\u9054\u79ae (''Literally -- one who knows the books and achieves proper mannerism'') has been used to praise and characterize those of high academic and moral accomplishments and those of proper manner and conduct. Using the proper honorific or humble forms of address and other parts of speech toward oneself and toward others is an important element or requirement in the proper observation of \u79ae\u5100 (''l\u01d0y\u00ed'', ''etiquette, formality, and rite''). Honorific parts of speech include pronoun substitutes, modified nouns, proper nouns, and pronouns, modified verbs, honorific adjectives, honorific [[Chengyu|\u6210\u8a9e]] (''ch\u00e9ngy\u01d4, \"canned phrases/idioms\"''), and honorific alternatives for other neutral or deprecating words.   \n\nIn ancient China, myriad humble and respectful forms of address, in lieu of personal pronouns and names, were used for various social relationships and situations. The choice of a pronoun substitute was often in adherence to the concepts of {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u5351|z\u016bnb\u0113i}} (''Lit. above-beneath / superior-subordinate, \u201csocial hierarchy\u201d''), {{Ruby|\u8cb4\u8ce4|gu\u00ecji\u00e0n}} (''Lit. worthy-worthless'', \"''social class''\"), and {{Ruby|\u8f29\u5206|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (''\"seniority\"'') or {{Ruby|\u8f29|b\u00e8i}} for short. \n\n=== Social Hierarchy and Class ===\nIn the ''[[Confucianism|Confucian]]'' philosophical classic of ''<u>{{Ruby|\u6613\u50b3\u00b7\u7e6b\u8fad\u4e0a|y\u00eczhu\u00e0n x\u00ecc\u00ed sh\u00e0ng}}</u>'' or [[Ten Wings|''<u>\"Yizhuan - Xici\"</u>'']] -- a latter day commentary on the book of ''<u>{{Ruby|\u6613\u7d93|y\u00ecj\u012bng}}</u>'' or \"[[I Ching|''<u>I Ching\"</u>'']] (''\"Book of Changes\"''), it is stated \"''\u5929\u5c0a\u5730\u5351\uff0c\u4e7e\u5764\u5b9a\u77e3\u3002\u5351\u9ad8\u4ee5\u9673\uff0c\u8cb4\u8ce4\u4f4d\u77e3\u3002''\" -- it was believed in ancient China that both the order of nature, i.e., \u5929\u5c0a\u5730\u5351 (''heaven be above, earth be beneath''), and from it the derived order of man, were long predetermined and dictated by the heavens, e.g., \u541b\u5c0a\u81e3\u5351 (''king be above/superior, court officials be beneath/subordinate''), \u7537\u5c0a\u5973\u5351 (''man superior, woman subordinate''), \u592b\u5c0a\u5a66\u5351 (''husband superior, wife subordinate''), and \u7236\u5c0a\u5b50\u5351 (''father superior, son subordinate'') etc. Every king and their subject, every man and woman, every husband and wife, and every father and son, should naturally follow this predetermined order and practice proper {{Ruby|\u793c\u4eea|l\u01d0y\u00ed}} and conduct. As a large part of {{Ruby|\u793c\u4eea|l\u01d0y\u00ed}}, proper speech was of great importance.  \n\nTherefore in speech, among other forms of {{Ruby|\u79ae\u5100|l\u01d0y\u00ed}} and social behaviors, the \"subordinate\"  or \"inferior\" would employ self-deprecating and humble language towards self and respectful language towards the \"superior\" as a recognition of their relative places in the \"natural\" hierarchy. On the other hand, the \"superiors\" would often also use humble language as a display of humility and virtue''.'' Unsurprisingly, the characters \u5c0a~ and \u5351~ also became honorific and humble prefixes, respectively. For example, the humble substitute {{Ruby|\u5351\u4e0b|b\u0113ixi\u00e0}}(''this inferior one below'') would be used, among other deprecating substitutes, in place of the pronoun \"I\", and the honorific substitute {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u4e0a|z\u016bnsh\u00e0ng}} (''the superior one above'') would replace the pronoun \"you\" (''later also used for \"your parents\"'').  \n\nRelated to {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u5351|z\u016bnb\u0113i}} is the concept of {{Ruby|\u8cb4\u8ce4|gu\u00ecji\u00e0n}}. Those with power, money and status were \u8cb4 (''worthy, honorable''), and those without were \u8ce4 (''worthless, despised''). These two characters also became the honorific and humble prefixes \u8cb4~ and \u8ce4~. Examples: \u8cb4\u570b (''your honorable country''), \u8cb4\u5e9a (''your honorable age''), \u8cb4\u59d3 (''your honorable surname''), \u8cb4\u516c\u53f8 (''your honorable company''), and \u8ce4\u59d3 (''my unworthy surname''), \u8ce4\u6c11 (''the unworthy and despised commoner''), \u8ce4\u59be (''this unworthy wife of yours''), \u8ce4\u5185 (''my unworthy wife''), etc. \u8cb4~ remains a commonly used honorific prefix to this day.\n\n=== Seniority ===\nLikewise, those of a junior {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (i.e., {{Ruby|\u665a\u8f29|w\u01cenb\u00e8i}} or {{Ruby|\u5f8c\u8f29|h\u00f2ub\u00e8i}}) would show respect and deference to their {{Ruby|\u524d\u8f29|qi\u00e1nbe\u00ec}} (''\"senior\"'') , {{Ruby|\u9577\u8f29|zh\u01cengbe\u00ec}} ''or'' {{Ruby|\u5148\u8f29|xi\u0101nbe\u00ec}} (''\"elder\"''), and {{Ruby|\u7956\u8f29|z\u016dbe\u00ec}} ''(\"ancestors\")''. {{Ruby|\u8f88\u5206|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} is not necessarily based on age, for example, a younger person who entered a school or profession before an older person would be considered the {{Ruby|\u524d\u8f29|qi\u00e1nbe\u00ec}}. A person who is much younger than his/her nephew in a large extended family would still be a {{Ruby|\u9577\u8f29|zh\u01cengbe\u00ec}} to the nephew''.'' If two people are of the same {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (i.e., {{Ruby|\u5e73\u8f29|p\u00edngbe\u00ec}} or {{Ruby|\u540c\u8f29|t\u00f3ngbe\u00ec}}''),'' then either experience or age would determine the hierarchy depending on the situation. \n\nContemporary Chinese mostly abandoned the {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u5351|z\u016bnb\u0113i}} and {{Ruby|\u8cb4\u8ce4|gu\u00ecji\u00e0n}} distinctions (especially \u5351 and \u8ce4) in its honorific practice, but retains elements of the {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} distinctions. For example, the suffixes ~{{Ruby|\u59d0|ji\u0115}} (''Lit. elder sister'') and ~{{Ruby|\u54e5|g\u0113}} (''Lit. elder brother'') are commonly used by junior people when addressing their {{Ruby|\u5e73\u8f88|p\u00edngbe\u00ec}} seniors. Those of the next higher {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (i.e., {{Ruby|\u9577\u8f29|zh\u01cengbe\u00ec}}) acquire the suffixes ~\u59e8\uff0c~\u53d4 etc. Those even higher in {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} receive the suffixes ~\u5a46\uff0c~\u516c\uff0c~\u4f2f etc. When addressing a {{Ruby|\u5e73\u8f29|p\u00edngbe\u00ec}} junior, the suffixes ~\u59b9, ~\u5f1f are used. While these suffixes derived from [[Chinese kinship|kinship names]], they are commonly used between unrelated people. Example: when addressing a group leader at work whose name is {{Ruby|\u82b3|f\u0101ng}}\uff0cthe less experienced person in the group might call her \u82b3\u59d0 ''F\u0101ng-ji\u011b''. Because these suffixes have an age connotation, their use and application are not always appropriate. Variations were created such as ~\u5c0f\u54e5\u54e5 (''Lit. little elder brother'')\uff0c ~\u5c0f\u59d0\u59d0 (''Lit. little elder sister'') to soften age connotations. A wrong {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} suffix can also be used intentionally to please or belittle another person. For example, some older women may prefer a  \uff5e\u59e8 rather than \uff5e\u5a46 suffix, and a middle age woman may prefer to still be called ~\u59d0 rather than ~\u59e8. When these suffixes are used without a preceding name, or when a name is not complemented by one of these suffixes, the intimacy prefix {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}}~ is often added. {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}} is a functional particle without an actual meaning by itself, but when combined with a name (e.g., \u963f\u82b3\uff0c\u963f\u5f3a) or with one of the {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} related suffixes (e.g., \u963f\u54e5\uff0c\u963f\u59e8\uff0c\u963f\u4f2f\uff0c\u963f\u5a46), {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}} adds a sense of intimacy (i.e., closeness, affection) with the addressed. {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}} can be used together with a {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} suffix, e.g., \u963f\u82b3\u59d0 (''\u0101-F\u0101ng-ji\u011b'')\uff0c\u963f\u5f3a\u54e5 (''\u0101-Qi\u00e1ng-g\u0113''). Other related honorific modifiers include \u8001~\uff0c\u5927~\uff0c\u5c0f~\uff0c~\u603b\uff0c~\u8463, see noun complements section below for more details.  \n\n=== Honorific Verbs ===\nLike nouns and proper nouns, some Chinese verbs can also be complemented with an honorific modifier. For example, the verbs {{Ruby|\u544a|g\u00e0o}} ''(\"to tell\"''), {{Ruby|\u8fd8|hu\u00e1n}} ''(\"to return\"'')\uff0c{{Ruby|\u966a|p\u00e9i}} ''(\"to accompany\"''), {{Ruby|\u529d|qu\u00e0n}} ''(\"to urge\"'')\uff0c{{Ruby|\u9001|s\u00f2ng}} ''(\"to gift\"'') can be complemented by the honorific prefix {{Ruby|\u5949|f\u00e8ng}}~ (''Lit. to offer respectfully)'' to form the more polite versions \u5949\u544a (''I respectfully tell you''), \u5949\u8fd8 (''I respectfully return'' ''to you''), \u5949\u966a (''I respectfully accompany you''), \u5949\u529d (''I respectfully urge you''), and \u5949\u9001 (''I respectfully gift you''). Another example is the honorific prefix {{Ruby|\u606d|g\u014dng}}~ (''Lit. \"look forward to respectfully''\"), e.g., \u606d\u8d3a (''I respectfully congratulate you''), \u606d\u5019 (''I respectfully await you''), \u606d\u8bf7 (''I respectfully invite you'')\uff0c\u606d\u8fce (''I respectfully welcome you''). The addition of the honorific prefix turns these verbs into a politer version. Unlike adverbs, the prefixes are often verbs themselves, and the compounded honorific verb functions as a single language unit (i.e., a single verb). Other common prefixes for verbs and verb examples are summarized in the verb complements section below.\n\n=== Grammar ===\nIn practice, many of the honorific compound words are used as canned polite word alternatives, rather than being grammatically composed as people speak. There is not a systemic rule in Chinese grammar to alter words (e.g., conjugation or other inflections) for the purpose of increasing speech politeness, though the same effect can often be achieved. However, in letters ({{Ruby|\u4e66\u4fe1|sh\u016bx\u00ecn}}\uff0c{{Ruby|\u5bb6\u4e66|ji\u0101sh\u016b}}) and official documents ({{Ruby|\u516c\u6587|g\u014dngw\u00e9n}}), a complex system of honorifics and rule sets exists.\n\n== Examples of Honorific Speech ==\n'''Example 1:'''<!-- RUBYTEXT FAIL in original\n-->\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4f60|n\u01d0}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u59d3|x\u00ecng}}  {{ruby-zh-p|\u751a\u9ebc|sh\u00e9nme}} \uff1f\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4f60|n\u01d0}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u59d3|x\u00ecng}}  {{ruby-zh-p|\u4ec0\u4e48|sh\u00e9nme}} \uff1f\n:''\"What is your family name (surname)?\"''\n\nThe sentence above is a perfectly acceptable question when addressing others of equal or lower status (e.g., addressing a junior or a child). To increase politeness, e.g., if the addressee is of higher status or the person asking the question wants to show more respect, several changes may be employed:\n\n#The honorific prefix {{lang|zh|\u8acb}} (''<small>lit.</small> to request'') + verb {{lang|zh|\u554f}} (''to ask'') (''q\u01d0ngw\u00e8n,'' ''\"May I please ask...\"; <small>lit.</small> [I] request to ask'') may be added\n#The regular second-person pronoun {{lang|zh|\u4f60}} (''n\u01d0'', ''\"you\"'') may be replaced by the honorific second-person pronoun {{lang|zh|\u60a8}} (''n\u00edn'', ''\"you\" [courteous]'')\n#The honorific prefix {{lang|zh|\u8cb4}} (''gu\u00ec, <small>lit.</small> \"worthy\", \"honorable\"'') may be added before {{lang|zh|\u59d3}} (''x\u00ecng'', ''\"family name\"''); \u59d3 is used as a verb (''i.e., \"to have the family name of\"'').\n#If the honorific prefix {{lang|zh|\u8cb4}} is added, the contemporary interrogative pronoun {{lang|zh|\u751a\u9ebd}} (''sh\u00e9nme'', ''\"what\"'') is usually dropped.\n\nThe resulting sentence: \n<!-- RUBYTEXT FAIL in original\n-->\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u8acb|q\u01d0ng}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u554f|w\u00e8n}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u60a8|n\u00edn}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8cb4\u59d3|gu\u00ecx\u00ecng}}  \uff1f\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u8bf7|q\u01d0ng}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u95ee|w\u00e8n}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u60a8|n\u00edn}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8d35\u59d3|gu\u00ecx\u00ecng}}  \uff1f\n:''\"May I (respectfully) request to ask you (whom I cherish) for your honorable surname?\"''\n\nis more polite and commonly used among people in formal situations.\n\n'''Example 2:'''\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c0f\u59d0|xi\u00e1oji\u011b}}\uff0c{{ruby-zh-p|\u4f60|n\u01d0}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u591a\u5927|du\u014dd\u00e0}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u4e86|le}}\uff1f\n:''\"Miss, how old are you?\"''\n\nThe above can be changed to a more polite question by employing the honorific prefix \u6562 (''<small>lit.</small> to dare'') + verb \u554f (''to ask'') (''g\u01cenw\u00e8n'', ''\"[May I] dare to ask...\"''), and honorific prefix \u82b3 (''f\u0101ng, <small>lit.</small> fragrant, virtuous, beautiful'') + noun \u9f61 (''l\u00edng, age'').\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u6562\u554f|g\u01cenw\u00e8n}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c0f\u59d0|xi\u00e1oji\u011b}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u82b3\u9f61|f\u0101ngl\u00edng}}?\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u6562\u95ee|g\u01cenw\u00e8n}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c0f\u59d0|xi\u00e1oji\u011b}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u82b3\u9f84|f\u0101ngl\u00edng}}? \n:''\"May I dare to ask for this Miss's age (of fragrance and beauty)?\"''\n\nThe second-person pronoun {{lang|zh|\u4f60}} (''\"you\"'') is substituted entirely by the honorific title {{lang|zh|\u5c0f\u59d0}} (''\"Miss\"'') in this case. This latter way of questioning is more of classical usage, but is still occasionally used in contemporary Chinese. It is also an example of elegant speech ({{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}}).\n\n\n== Categorization ==\nIn general, there are several types of honorifics used in the Chinese language as described below.  \n\n=== Respectful Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u656c\u8a9e|j\u00ecngy\u01d4}} - Respectful Language employs modified words or substitutes called {{Ruby|\u656c\u8fad|j\u00ecngc\u00ed}} (''Lit. respectful vocabulary'') that convey a sense of respect for the addressee. For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u4ee4\u611b|l\u00ecng'\u00e0i}}: ''Lit. the beautiful and beloved --'' Your daughter; the honorific prefix \u4ee4~ replaces the pronoun \"your\".\n*{{Ruby|\u4ee4\u5343\u91d1|l\u00ecngqi\u0101nj\u012bn}}'': Lit. the beautiful one who is worth a thousand gold --'' Your daughter.\n*{{Ruby|\u8cb4\u5bf6\u865f|gu\u00ecb\u01ceoh\u00e0o}}: ''Lit. the highly valued precious banner'' -- Your business; the honorific prefix \u8cb4~ replaces the pronoun \"your\", and the prefix \u5bf3~ modifies \u865f to form an honorific substitute for someone's business.\n\n=== Humble Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u8b19\u8a9e|qi\u0101ny\u016d}} - Humble Language employs modified words or substitutes called {{Ruby|\u8b19\u8fad|qi\u0101nc\u00ed}} (''Lit. humble vocabulary)'' that convey a sense of self-deprecation and humility for the speaker. For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u5728\u4e0b|z\u00e0ixi\u00e0}}'': Lit. this one who is beneath you --'' used as pronoun \"I\"\n*{{Ruby|\u5bd2\u820d|h\u00e1nsh\u00e8}}'': Lit. Humble and Insignificant Residence --'' my home\n*{{Ruby|\u8ce4\u5185|ji\u00e0nn\u00e8i}}: ''Lit. the worthless despised one inside'' -- my wife\n\n=== Indirect Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u5a49\u8a9e|w\u01ceny\u016d}} - Indirect Language employs words called {{Ruby|\u5a49\u8fad|w\u01cenc\u00ed}} (''Lit. indirect vocabulary - e.g., euphemisms'') that are used to hide or beautify an otherwise unfortunate event or action.  For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u6b78\u5929|gu\u012bti\u0101n}}'': Lit. return to heaven --'' to have died\n*{{Ruby|\u6302\u5f69|gu\u00e0ca\u01d0}}: ''Lit''. ''to hang colorful decorations'' -- to have been shot\n*{{Ruby|\u51a4\u5bb6|yu\u0101njia}}: ''Lit. destined/mortal enemies'' -- often used to mean lovers\n\n=== Courteous Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u5ba2\u5957\u8a9e|k\u00e8t\u00e0oy\u01d4}} - Courteous Language employs specific words or phrases that have courteous and praising connotations intended to flatter the addressee. For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u4e0d\u6562\u9ad8\u6500|b\u00f9g\u01cen g\u0101op\u0101n}}'': Lit. dare not climb up high to you'' -''-'' I dare not compare myself to you\n*{{Ruby|\u4e45\u4ef0\u5927\u540d|ji\u00fay\u01ceng d\u00e0m\u00edng}}'': Lit. long admired big name --'' I've known and admired you for a long time; used when meeting someone you've heard of (not necessarily admired).\n*{{Ruby|\u9ad8\u64e1\u8cb4\u624b|g\u0101ot\u00e1i gu\u00ecsh\u01d2u}}'': Lit. lift up high honorable hand --'' Please be magnanimous and don't hurt me (i.e., stop doing what you intend to do to me)\n\n=== Elegant Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}} - Elegant Language employs elegant or beautiful expressions and words in lieu of everyday casual words and phrases to describe people, objects, actions or concepts. It is often used on occasions where casual language may be inappropriate. Due to the lack of equivalent expressions in English, the translated phrases often do not convey the same sense of beauty or elegance. Examples:\n\n*{{Ruby|\u7d05\u9854\u77e5\u5df1|h\u00f3ngy\u00e1n zh\u012bj\u01d0}}: ''Lit. red face / know self'' -- beautiful beloved girlfriend (\"red\" refers to the make up or the natural color on a beautiful young woman's face; \"know self\" means someone who knows one well as in the close friendship between lovers).

Below is a collection of the better known honorific forms of address that have been used at one time or another in the Chinese lexicon. Although many are obsolete in usage, most remain relevant in contemporary literature and in the understanding of the Chinese language. Pronunciations given are those of today's [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Because of the vast number and complexity, the list provided is intended for reference rather than completeness.  \n\n===First-Person===\nWhen referring to oneself in ancient China, people avoided first-person pronouns (\"I\", \"me\", \"we\", and \"us\"). Instead, a third-person descriptor was used, which varied according to the situation. Referring to oneself in the third-person could be used arrogantly as well, to assert one's superiority or dominance over one's audience. This was most common in the imperial middle management {{ndash}} the imperial consorts, the military, and the imperial bureaucracy (e.g., \u672c\u5b98\uff0c\u672c\u5c06\u519b\uff0c\u672c\u5bab\uff0c\u672c\u5927\u723a), with the emperor instead often describing himself in sorrowful terms out of respect for his deceased father (e.g., \u5b64\u738b \"''This Orphaned King''\"\uff0c\u5be1\u4eba \"''This Lonesome Man''\").\n\nFor the same reasons, and to a much lesser degree, the first-person pronouns are sometimes avoided also in contemporary usage. Often, the generic self-referencing prefix \u672c~\uff0c\u8be5~\uff0c or a humble / self-deprecating prefix such as \u655d~ is used with a third-person descriptor, for example: \u672c\u4eba\u662f\u6765\u81ea\u7532\u516c\u53f8\u7684\uff0c\u655d\u516c\u53f8\u60f3\u8ddf\u60a8\u505a\u4e2a\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002-- Literally, \"''This person is from company A, this unkempt company would like to do an interview with you.''\" translated to \"''I am from company A, we would like to do an interview with you.''\"\n\nProvided below are some first-person honorific substitutes and usages. Their relevancy (i.e., contemporary vs. classical) and gender association are also indicated. Plurals (\"we\", \"us\") in classical Chinese are formed by the suffixes ~\u7b49 or ~\u4f17\u4eba etc., and in contemporary Chinese by ~\u4eec. A \"classical usage\" designation does not preclude usage in contemporary speech or writing, as contemporary Chinese often incorporates classical elements, though it is much less likely to be seen or used in the contemporary context. \n\n==== Commoners and the Humble ====\nThe following directly replace the pronoun \"I\" in usage by commoners or people of low social status. Example: rather than \u543e(\u6211)\u4ee5\u70ba\u6b64\u65b9\u4e0d\u53ef - \"''I think this idea will not work''\" one would say \u611a\u4ee5\u70ba\u6b64\u65b9\u4e0d\u53ef - \"''This unintelligent one thinks this idea will not work.''\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Often, the same honorific substitutes can be used for both second-person and third-person.\n\nIn contemporary Chinese (both spoken and written), the second-person singular pronoun {{lang|zh|\u4f60}} (''n\u01d0'', \"you\") can be substituted with its polite form {{lang|zh|\u60a8}} (''n\u01d0n'', \"you\" [cherished]) to express politeness. In some cases, the addressee's profession or title can be used. In others, specific honorific substitutes are used, e.g., \u9601\u4e0b (Lit. beneath your pavilion) is used instead of the pronoun \"you\" to show respect. Historically, many other honorific usages existed.\n\nIn contemporary usage, the pronouns \u4f60/\u60a8\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u4ed6/\u5979\uff0cand \u4ed6/\u5979\u4eec are sometimes appended redundantly to the honorific substitute. For example, \u8bf7\u9601\u4e0b\u60a8\u6162\u8d70 - \u60a8 is optionally inserted after \u9601\u4e0b. This is likely out of a contemporary habit to use actual pronouns in speech.  \n\nProvided below are some of the better known second-person or third-person honorific substitutes and usages. \n\n==== Royalty ====\nThe following were honorifics used when people addressed the Royalty in ancient China. Often, imperial titles were also used as pronoun substitutes. For example, the emperor may address the empress by her title \u7687\u540e. A royal servant may address a princess as \u516c\u4e3b. Not all royal titles are listed. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Traditional Chinese !! Simplified Chinese !! Pinyin\n!Literal Meaning!! Meaning in Usage\n!Gender\n!Contemporary or Classical Usage!!

Some may have shown up in pronoun discussions. While noun modifiers are technically adjectives, honorific prefixes/suffixes are different from normal adjectives in that they become part of the noun in usage, and the meaning of the modifying prefix/suffix is usually not taken literally - only added functionally to show respect or humility. Because Chinese words are usually formed also by combining multiple root characters (each with a literal meaning), it is not always immediately apparent when using a polite version of a word that an honorific modifier is in use.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Once ubiquitously employed in ancient China, a large percent has fallen out of use in the contemporary Chinese lexicon. The promotion of [[Written vernacular Chinese|vernacular Chinese]] during the [[New Culture Movement]] (\u65b0\u6587\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8 or \u4e94\u56db\u6587\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8) of the 1910s and 1920s in China further hastened the demise of a large body of Chinese honorifics previously preserved in the vocabulary and grammar of [[Classical Chinese]].  \n\nAlthough Chinese honorifics have simplified to a large degree, contemporary Chinese still retains a sizable set of honorifics. Many of the classical constructs are also occasionally employed by contemporary speakers to convey formality, humility, politeness or respect. Usage of classical Chinese honorifics is also found frequently in contemporary Chinese literature and television or cinematic productions that are set in the historical periods. Honorific language in Chinese is achieved by using honorific or beautifying alternatives, prefixing or suffixing a word with a polite complement, or by dropping casual-sounding words. In general, language referring to oneself exhibits [[self-deprecating]] humbleness - called {{Ruby|\u8b19\u8a9e|qi\u0101ny\u016d}} ''(\"humble language\"''), while language referring to others shows approval and respect - called {{Ruby|\u656c\u8a9e|j\u00ecngy\u01d4}} (''\"respectful language\"''). Other types of honorific language include {{Ruby|\u5a49\u8a9e|w\u01ceny\u016d}} (''\"indirect language\"''), {{Ruby|\u5ba2\u5957\u8a9e|k\u00e8t\u00e0oy\u01d4}} (''\"courteous language\"''), and {{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}} (''\"elegant language\"'') that are often used to convey a sense of respect, courtesy, or elegance. \n\nBecause of its official status as the common language of China, [[Mandarin Chinese]] is used herein synonymously with the term \"contemporary Chinese\". Variations in usage and grammar exist in the numerous modern [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialects]].\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe term \u77e5\u66f8\u9054\u79ae (''Literally -- one who knows the books and achieves proper mannerism'') has been used to praise and characterize those of high academic and moral accomplishments and those of proper manner and conduct. Using the proper honorific or humble forms of address and other parts of speech toward oneself and toward others is an important element or requirement in the proper observation of \u79ae\u5100 (''l\u01d0y\u00ed'', ''etiquette, formality, and rite''). Honorific parts of speech include pronoun substitutes, modified nouns, proper nouns, and pronouns, modified verbs, honorific adjectives, honorific [[Chengyu|\u6210\u8a9e]] (''ch\u00e9ngy\u01d4, \"canned phrases/idioms\"''), and honorific alternatives for other neutral or deprecating words.   \n\nIn ancient China, myriad humble and respectful forms of address, in lieu of personal pronouns and names, were used for various social relationships and situations. The choice of a pronoun substitute was often in adherence to the concepts of {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u5351|z\u016bnb\u0113i}} (''Lit. above-beneath / superior-subordinate, \u201csocial hierarchy\u201d''), {{Ruby|\u8cb4\u8ce4|gu\u00ecji\u00e0n}} (''Lit. worthy-worthless'', \"''social class''\"), and {{Ruby|\u8f29\u5206|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (''\"seniority\"'') or {{Ruby|\u8f29|b\u00e8i}} for short. \n\n=== Social Hierarchy and Class ===\nIn the ''[[Confucianism|Confucian]]'' philosophical classic of ''<u>{{Ruby|\u6613\u50b3\u00b7\u7e6b\u8fad\u4e0a|y\u00eczhu\u00e0n x\u00ecc\u00ed sh\u00e0ng}}</u>'' or [[Ten Wings|''<u>\"Yizhuan - Xici\"</u>'']] -- a latter day commentary on the book of ''<u>{{Ruby|\u6613\u7d93|y\u00ecj\u012bng}}</u>'' or \"[[I Ching|''<u>I Ching\"</u>'']] (''\"Book of Changes\"''), it is stated \"''\u5929\u5c0a\u5730\u5351\uff0c\u4e7e\u5764\u5b9a\u77e3\u3002\u5351\u9ad8\u4ee5\u9673\uff0c\u8cb4\u8ce4\u4f4d\u77e3\u3002''\" -- it was believed in ancient China that both the order of nature, i.e., \u5929\u5c0a\u5730\u5351 (''heaven be above, earth be beneath''), and from it the derived order of man, were long predetermined and dictated by the heavens, e.g., \u541b\u5c0a\u81e3\u5351 (''king be above/superior, court officials be beneath/subordinate''), \u7537\u5c0a\u5973\u5351 (''man superior, woman subordinate''), \u592b\u5c0a\u5a66\u5351 (''husband superior, wife subordinate''), and \u7236\u5c0a\u5b50\u5351 (''father superior, son subordinate'') etc. Every king and their subject, every man and woman, every husband and wife, and every father and son, should naturally follow this predetermined order and practice proper {{Ruby|\u793c\u4eea|l\u01d0y\u00ed}} and conduct. As a large part of {{Ruby|\u793c\u4eea|l\u01d0y\u00ed}}, proper speech was of great importance.  \n\nTherefore in speech, among other forms of {{Ruby|\u79ae\u5100|l\u01d0y\u00ed}} and social behaviors, the \"subordinate\"  or \"inferior\" would employ self-deprecating and humble language towards self and respectful language towards the \"superior\" as a recognition of their relative places in the \"natural\" hierarchy. On the other hand, the \"superiors\" would often also use humble language as a display of humility and virtue''.'' Unsurprisingly, the characters \u5c0a~ and \u5351~ also became honorific and humble prefixes, respectively. For example, the humble substitute {{Ruby|\u5351\u4e0b|b\u0113ixi\u00e0}}(''this inferior one below'') would be used, among other deprecating substitutes, in place of the pronoun \"I\", and the honorific substitute {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u4e0a|z\u016bnsh\u00e0ng}} (''the superior one above'') would replace the pronoun \"you\" (''later also used for \"your parents\"'').  \n\nRelated to {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u5351|z\u016bnb\u0113i}} is the concept of {{Ruby|\u8cb4\u8ce4|gu\u00ecji\u00e0n}}. Those with power, money and status were \u8cb4 (''worthy, honorable''), and those without were \u8ce4 (''worthless, despised''). These two characters also became the honorific and humble prefixes \u8cb4~ and \u8ce4~. Examples: \u8cb4\u570b (''your honorable country''), \u8cb4\u5e9a (''your honorable age''), \u8cb4\u59d3 (''your honorable surname''), \u8cb4\u516c\u53f8 (''your honorable company''), and \u8ce4\u59d3 (''my unworthy surname''), \u8ce4\u6c11 (''the unworthy and despised commoner''), \u8ce4\u59be (''this unworthy wife of yours''), \u8ce4\u5185 (''my unworthy wife''), etc. \u8cb4~ remains a commonly used honorific prefix to this day.\n\n=== Seniority ===\nLikewise, those of a junior {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (i.e., {{Ruby|\u665a\u8f29|w\u01cenb\u00e8i}} or {{Ruby|\u5f8c\u8f29|h\u00f2ub\u00e8i}}) would show respect and deference to their {{Ruby|\u524d\u8f29|qi\u00e1nbe\u00ec}} (''\"senior\"'') , {{Ruby|\u9577\u8f29|zh\u01cengbe\u00ec}} ''or'' {{Ruby|\u5148\u8f29|xi\u0101nbe\u00ec}} (''\"elder\"''), and {{Ruby|\u7956\u8f29|z\u016dbe\u00ec}} ''(\"ancestors\")''. {{Ruby|\u8f88\u5206|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} is not necessarily based on age, for example, a younger person who entered a school or profession before an older person would be considered the {{Ruby|\u524d\u8f29|qi\u00e1nbe\u00ec}}. A person who is much younger than his/her nephew in a large extended family would still be a {{Ruby|\u9577\u8f29|zh\u01cengbe\u00ec}} to the nephew''.'' If two people are of the same {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (i.e., {{Ruby|\u5e73\u8f29|p\u00edngbe\u00ec}} or {{Ruby|\u540c\u8f29|t\u00f3ngbe\u00ec}}''),'' then either experience or age would determine the hierarchy depending on the situation. \n\nContemporary Chinese mostly abandoned the {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u5351|z\u016bnb\u0113i}} and {{Ruby|\u8cb4\u8ce4|gu\u00ecji\u00e0n}} distinctions (especially \u5351 and \u8ce4) in its honorific practice, but retains elements of the {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} distinctions. For example, the suffixes ~{{Ruby|\u59d0|ji\u0115}} (''Lit. elder sister'') and ~{{Ruby|\u54e5|g\u0113}} (''Lit. elder brother'') are commonly used by junior people when addressing their {{Ruby|\u5e73\u8f88|p\u00edngbe\u00ec}} seniors. Those of the next higher {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (i.e., {{Ruby|\u9577\u8f29|zh\u01cengbe\u00ec}}) acquire the suffixes ~\u59e8\uff0c~\u53d4 etc. Those even higher in {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} receive the suffixes ~\u5a46\uff0c~\u516c\uff0c~\u4f2f etc. When addressing a {{Ruby|\u5e73\u8f29|p\u00edngbe\u00ec}} junior, the suffixes ~\u59b9, ~\u5f1f are used. While these suffixes derived from [[Chinese kinship|kinship names]], they are commonly used between unrelated people. Example: when addressing a group leader at work whose name is {{Ruby|\u82b3|f\u0101ng}}\uff0cthe less experienced person in the group might call her \u82b3\u59d0 ''F\u0101ng-ji\u011b''. Because these suffixes have an age connotation, their use and application are not always appropriate. Variations were created such as ~\u5c0f\u54e5\u54e5 (''Lit. little elder brother'')\uff0c ~\u5c0f\u59d0\u59d0 (''Lit. little elder sister'') to soften age connotations. A wrong {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} suffix can also be used intentionally to please or belittle another person. For example, some older women may prefer a  \uff5e\u59e8 rather than \uff5e\u5a46 suffix, and a middle age woman may prefer to still be called ~\u59d0 rather than ~\u59e8. When these suffixes are used without a preceding name, or when a name is not complemented by one of these suffixes, the intimacy prefix {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}}~ is often added. {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}} is a functional particle without an actual meaning by itself, but when combined with a name (e.g., \u963f\u82b3\uff0c\u963f\u5f3a) or with one of the {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} related suffixes (e.g., \u963f\u54e5\uff0c\u963f\u59e8\uff0c\u963f\u4f2f\uff0c\u963f\u5a46), {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}} adds a sense of intimacy (i.e., closeness, affection) with the addressed. {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}} can be used together with a {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} suffix, e.g., \u963f\u82b3\u59d0 (''\u0101-F\u0101ng-ji\u011b'')\uff0c\u963f\u5f3a\u54e5 (''\u0101-Qi\u00e1ng-g\u0113''). Other related honorific modifiers include \u8001~\uff0c\u5927~\uff0c\u5c0f~\uff0c~\u603b\uff0c~\u8463, see noun complements section below for more details.  \n\n=== Honorific Verbs ===\nLike nouns and proper nouns, some Chinese verbs can also be complemented with an honorific modifier. For example, the verbs {{Ruby|\u544a|g\u00e0o}} ''(\"to tell\"''), {{Ruby|\u8fd8|hu\u00e1n}} ''(\"to return\"'')\uff0c{{Ruby|\u966a|p\u00e9i}} ''(\"to accompany\"''), {{Ruby|\u529d|qu\u00e0n}} ''(\"to urge\"'')\uff0c{{Ruby|\u9001|s\u00f2ng}} ''(\"to gift\"'') can be complemented by the honorific prefix {{Ruby|\u5949|f\u00e8ng}}~ (''Lit. to offer respectfully)'' to form the more polite versions \u5949\u544a (''I respectfully tell you''), \u5949\u8fd8 (''I respectfully return'' ''to you''), \u5949\u966a (''I respectfully accompany you''), \u5949\u529d (''I respectfully urge you''), and \u5949\u9001 (''I respectfully gift you''). Another example is the honorific prefix {{Ruby|\u606d|g\u014dng}}~ (''Lit. \"look forward to respectfully''\"), e.g., \u606d\u8d3a (''I respectfully congratulate you''), \u606d\u5019 (''I respectfully await you''), \u606d\u8bf7 (''I respectfully invite you'')\uff0c\u606d\u8fce (''I respectfully welcome you''). The addition of the honorific prefix turns these verbs into a politer version. Unlike adverbs, the prefixes are often verbs themselves, and the compounded honorific verb functions as a single language unit (i.e., a single verb). Other common prefixes for verbs and verb examples are summarized in the verb complements section below.\n\n=== Grammar ===\nIn practice, many of the honorific compound words are used as canned polite word alternatives, rather than being grammatically composed as people speak. There is not a systemic rule in Chinese grammar to alter words (e.g., conjugation or other inflections) for the purpose of increasing speech politeness, though the same effect can often be achieved. However, in letters ({{Ruby|\u4e66\u4fe1|sh\u016bx\u00ecn}}\uff0c{{Ruby|\u5bb6\u4e66|ji\u0101sh\u016b}}) and official documents ({{Ruby|\u516c\u6587|g\u014dngw\u00e9n}}), a complex system of honorifics and rule sets exists.\n\n== Examples of Honorific Speech ==\n'''Example 1:'''<!-- RUBYTEXT FAIL in original\n-->\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4f60|n\u01d0}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u59d3|x\u00ecng}}  {{ruby-zh-p|\u751a\u9ebc|sh\u00e9nme}} \uff1f\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4f60|n\u01d0}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u59d3|x\u00ecng}}  {{ruby-zh-p|\u4ec0\u4e48|sh\u00e9nme}} \uff1f\n:''\"What is your family name (surname)?\"''\n\nThe sentence above is a perfectly acceptable question when addressing others of equal or lower status (e.g., addressing a junior or a child). To increase politeness, e.g., if the addressee is of higher status or the person asking the question wants to show more respect, several changes may be employed:\n\n#The honorific prefix {{lang|zh|\u8acb}} (''<small>lit.</small> to request'') + verb {{lang|zh|\u554f}} (''to ask'') (''q\u01d0ngw\u00e8n,'' ''\"May I please ask...\"; <small>lit.</small> [I] request to ask'') may be added\n#The regular second-person pronoun {{lang|zh|\u4f60}} (''n\u01d0'', ''\"you\"'') may be replaced by the honorific second-person pronoun {{lang|zh|\u60a8}} (''n\u00edn'', ''\"you\" [courteous]'')\n#The honorific prefix {{lang|zh|\u8cb4}} (''gu\u00ec, <small>lit.</small> \"worthy\", \"honorable\"'') may be added before {{lang|zh|\u59d3}} (''x\u00ecng'', ''\"family name\"''); \u59d3 is used as a verb (''i.e., \"to have the family name of\"'').\n#If the honorific prefix {{lang|zh|\u8cb4}} is added, the contemporary interrogative pronoun {{lang|zh|\u751a\u9ebd}} (''sh\u00e9nme'', ''\"what\"'') is usually dropped.\n\nThe resulting sentence: \n<!-- RUBYTEXT FAIL in original\n-->\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u8acb|q\u01d0ng}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u554f|w\u00e8n}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u60a8|n\u00edn}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8cb4\u59d3|gu\u00ecx\u00ecng}}  \uff1f\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u8bf7|q\u01d0ng}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u95ee|w\u00e8n}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u60a8|n\u00edn}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8d35\u59d3|gu\u00ecx\u00ecng}}  \uff1f\n:''\"May I (respectfully) request to ask you (whom I cherish) for your honorable surname?\"''\n\nis more polite and commonly used among people in formal situations.\n\n'''Example 2:'''\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c0f\u59d0|xi\u00e1oji\u011b}}\uff0c{{ruby-zh-p|\u4f60|n\u01d0}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u591a\u5927|du\u014dd\u00e0}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u4e86|le}}\uff1f\n:''\"Miss, how old are you?\"''\n\nThe above can be changed to a more polite question by employing the honorific prefix \u6562 (''<small>lit.</small> to dare'') + verb \u554f (''to ask'') (''g\u01cenw\u00e8n'', ''\"[May I] dare to ask...\"''), and honorific prefix \u82b3 (''f\u0101ng, <small>lit.</small> fragrant, virtuous, beautiful'') + noun \u9f61 (''l\u00edng, age'').\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u6562\u554f|g\u01cenw\u00e8n}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c0f\u59d0|xi\u00e1oji\u011b}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u82b3\u9f61|f\u0101ngl\u00edng}}?\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u6562\u95ee|g\u01cenw\u00e8n}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c0f\u59d0|xi\u00e1oji\u011b}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u82b3\u9f84|f\u0101ngl\u00edng}}? \n:''\"May I dare to ask for this Miss's age (of fragrance and beauty)?\"''\n\nThe second-person pronoun {{lang|zh|\u4f60}} (''\"you\"'') is substituted entirely by the honorific title {{lang|zh|\u5c0f\u59d0}} (''\"Miss\"'') in this case. This latter way of questioning is more of classical usage, but is still occasionally used in contemporary Chinese. It is also an example of elegant speech ({{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}}).\n\n\n== Categorization ==\nIn general, there are several types of honorifics used in the Chinese language as described below.  \n\n=== Respectful Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u656c\u8a9e|j\u00ecngy\u01d4}} - Respectful Language employs modified words or substitutes called {{Ruby|\u656c\u8fad|j\u00ecngc\u00ed}} (''Lit. respectful vocabulary'') that convey a sense of respect for the addressee. For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u4ee4\u611b|l\u00ecng'\u00e0i}}: ''Lit. the beautiful and beloved --'' Your daughter; the honorific prefix \u4ee4~ replaces the pronoun \"your\".\n*{{Ruby|\u4ee4\u5343\u91d1|l\u00ecngqi\u0101nj\u012bn}}'': Lit. the beautiful one who is worth a thousand gold --'' Your daughter.\n*{{Ruby|\u8cb4\u5bf6\u865f|gu\u00ecb\u01ceoh\u00e0o}}: ''Lit. the highly valued precious banner'' -- Your business; the honorific prefix \u8cb4~ replaces the pronoun \"your\", and the prefix \u5bf3~ modifies \u865f to form an honorific substitute for someone's business.\n\n=== Humble Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u8b19\u8a9e|qi\u0101ny\u016d}} - Humble Language employs modified words or substitutes called {{Ruby|\u8b19\u8fad|qi\u0101nc\u00ed}} (''Lit. humble vocabulary)'' that convey a sense of self-deprecation and humility for the speaker. For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u5728\u4e0b|z\u00e0ixi\u00e0}}'': Lit. this one who is beneath you --'' used as pronoun \"I\"\n*{{Ruby|\u5bd2\u820d|h\u00e1nsh\u00e8}}'': Lit. Humble and Insignificant Residence --'' my home\n*{{Ruby|\u8ce4\u5185|ji\u00e0nn\u00e8i}}: ''Lit. the worthless despised one inside'' -- my wife\n\n=== Indirect Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u5a49\u8a9e|w\u01ceny\u016d}} - Indirect Language employs words called {{Ruby|\u5a49\u8fad|w\u01cenc\u00ed}} (''Lit. indirect vocabulary - e.g., euphemisms'') that are used to hide or beautify an otherwise unfortunate event or action.  For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u6b78\u5929|gu\u012bti\u0101n}}'': Lit. return to heaven --'' to have died\n*{{Ruby|\u6302\u5f69|gu\u00e0ca\u01d0}}: ''Lit''. ''to hang colorful decorations'' -- to have been shot\n*{{Ruby|\u51a4\u5bb6|yu\u0101njia}}: ''Lit. destined/mortal enemies'' -- often used to mean lovers\n\n=== Courteous Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u5ba2\u5957\u8a9e|k\u00e8t\u00e0oy\u01d4}} - Courteous Language employs specific words or phrases that have courteous and praising connotations intended to flatter the addressee. For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u4e0d\u6562\u9ad8\u6500|b\u00f9g\u01cen g\u0101op\u0101n}}'': Lit. dare not climb up high to you'' -''-'' I dare not compare myself to you\n*{{Ruby|\u4e45\u4ef0\u5927\u540d|ji\u00fay\u01ceng d\u00e0m\u00edng}}'': Lit. long admired big name --'' I've known and admired you for a long time; used when meeting someone you've heard of (not necessarily admired).\n*{{Ruby|\u9ad8\u64e1\u8cb4\u624b|g\u0101ot\u00e1i gu\u00ecsh\u01d2u}}'': Lit. lift up high honorable hand --'' Please be magnanimous and don't hurt me (i.e., stop doing what you intend to do to me)\n\n=== Elegant Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}} - Elegant Language employs elegant or beautiful expressions and words in lieu of everyday casual words and phrases to describe people, objects, actions or concepts. It is often used on occasions where casual language may be inappropriate. Due to the lack of equivalent expressions in English, the translated phrases often do not convey the same sense of beauty or elegance. Examples:\n\n*{{Ruby|\u7d05\u9854\u77e5\u5df1|h\u00f3ngy\u00e1n zh\u012bj\u01d0}}: ''Lit. red face / know self'' -- beautiful beloved girlfriend (\"red\" refers to the make up or the natural color on a beautiful young woman's face; \"know self\" means someone who knows one well as in the close friendship between lovers). Compared to the casual alternative: \u60c5\u4eba or \u5973\u670b\u53cb (lover / girlfriend)\n*{{Ruby|\u8acb\u7528\u8336|q\u012dng y\u00f2ngch\u00e1}}: ''Lit please use tea'' -- please have some tea. Compared to the casual alternative: \u559d\u8336\u5427 (''Lit. \"drink tea\"'')\n*{{Ruby|\u8acb\u6162\u7528|q\u01d0ng m\u00e0ny\u00f2ng}}: ''Lit. please take your time to use'' -- please enjoy [your meal]. Compared to the casual alternative: \u4f60\u4eec\u6162\u6162\u5403 (''Lit.'' ''\"you guys eat slowly\"'')\n*{{Ruby|\u8acb\u4ee3\u70ba\u7f8e\u8a00\u5e7e\u53e5|q\u012dng d\u00e0iw\u00e9i m\u0115iy\u00e1n j\u012dj\u00f9}}: ''Lit. please on my behalf beautify some of your language'' -- please say something nice about me/my situation in front of... Compared to the casual alternative: \u5e6b\u6211\u8aaa\u5e7e\u53e5\u597d\u8a71\u554a (''Lit. \"help me say some good words\"'')\n**\n\n== Honorific and Humble Forms of Address ==\n{{Ruby|\u656c\u8f9e|j\u00ecngc\u00ed}} (respectful vocabulary) and {{Ruby|\u8c26\u8f9e|qi\u0101nc\u00ed}} (humble vocabulary) are frequently found in the various forms of address in the Chinese language. Below is a collection of the better known honorific forms of address that have been used at one time or another in the Chinese lexicon. Although many are obsolete in usage, most remain relevant in contemporary literature and in the understanding of the Chinese language. Pronunciations given are those of today's [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Because of the vast number and complexity, the list provided is intended for reference rather than completeness.  \n\n===First-Person===\nWhen referring to oneself in ancient China, people avoided first-person pronouns (\"I\", \"me\", \"we\", and \"us\"). Instead, a third-person descriptor was used, which varied according to the situation. Referring to oneself in the third-person could be used arrogantly as well, to assert one's superiority or dominance over one's audience. This was most common in the imperial middle management {{ndash}} the imperial consorts, the military, and the imperial bureaucracy (e.g., \u672c\u5b98\uff0c\u672c\u5c06\u519b\uff0c\u672c\u5bab\uff0c\u672c\u5927\u723a), with the emperor instead often describing himself in sorrowful terms out of respect for his deceased father (e.g., \u5b64\u738b \"''This Orphaned King''\"\uff0c\u5be1\u4eba \"''This Lonesome Man''\").\n\nFor the same reasons, and to a much lesser degree, the first-person pronouns are sometimes avoided also in contemporary usage. Often, the generic self-referencing prefix \u672c~\uff0c\u8be5~\uff0c or a humble / self-deprecating prefix such as \u655d~ is used with a third-person descriptor, for example: \u672c\u4eba\u662f\u6765\u81ea\u7532\u516c\u53f8\u7684\uff0c\u655d\u516c\u53f8\u60f3\u8ddf\u60a8\u505a\u4e2a\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002-- Literally, \"''This person is from company A, this unkempt company would like to do an interview with you.''\" translated to \"''I am from company A, we would like to do an interview with you.''\"\n\nProvided below are some first-person honorific substitutes and usages. Their relevancy (i.e., contemporary vs. classical) and gender association are also indicated. Plurals (\"we\", \"us\") in classical Chinese are formed by the suffixes ~\u7b49 or ~\u4f17\u4eba etc., and in contemporary Chinese by ~\u4eec. A \"classical usage\" designation does not preclude usage in contemporary speech or writing, as contemporary Chinese often incorporates classical elements, though it is much less likely to be seen or used in the contemporary context. \n\n==== Commoners and the Humble ====\nThe following directly replace the pronoun \"I\" in usage by commoners or people of low social status. Example: rather than \u543e(\u6211)\u4ee5\u70ba\u6b64\u65b9\u4e0d\u53ef - \"''I think this idea will not work''\" one would say \u611a\u4ee5\u70ba\u6b64\u65b9\u4e0d\u53ef - \"''This unintelligent one thinks this idea will not work.''\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Often, the same honorific substitutes can be used for both second-person and third-person.\n\nIn contemporary Chinese (both spoken and written), the second-person singular pronoun {{lang|zh|\u4f60}} (''n\u01d0'', \"you\") can be substituted with its polite form {{lang|zh|\u60a8}} (''n\u01d0n'', \"you\" [cherished]) to express politeness. In some cases, the addressee's profession or title can be used. In others, specific honorific substitutes are used, e.g., \u9601\u4e0b (Lit. beneath your pavilion) is used instead of the pronoun \"you\" to show respect. Historically, many other honorific usages existed.\n\nIn contemporary usage, the pronouns \u4f60/\u60a8\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u4ed6/\u5979\uff0cand \u4ed6/\u5979\u4eec are sometimes appended redundantly to the honorific substitute. For example, \u8bf7\u9601\u4e0b\u60a8\u6162\u8d70 - \u60a8 is optionally inserted after \u9601\u4e0b. This is likely out of a contemporary habit to use actual pronouns in speech.  \n\nProvided below are some of the better known second-person or third-person honorific substitutes and usages. \n\n==== Royalty ====\nThe following were honorifics used when people addressed the Royalty in ancient China. Often, imperial titles were also used as pronoun substitutes. For example, the emperor may address the empress by her title \u7687\u540e. A royal servant may address a princess as \u516c\u4e3b. Not all royal titles are listed. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Traditional Chinese !! Simplified Chinese !! Pinyin\n!Literal Meaning!! Meaning in Usage\n!Gender\n!Contemporary or Classical Usage!!

Some may have shown up in pronoun discussions. While noun modifiers are technically adjectives, honorific prefixes/suffixes are different from normal adjectives in that they become part of the noun in usage, and the meaning of the modifying prefix/suffix is usually not taken literally - only added functionally to show respect or humility. Because Chinese words are usually formed also by combining multiple root characters (each with a literal meaning), it is not always immediately apparent when using a polite version of a word that an honorific modifier is in use.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Secession in the United States", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|A state leaving the Union}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn the context of the [[United States]], [[secession]] primarily refers to the voluntary withdrawal of one or more states from the Union that constitutes the United States; but may loosely refer to leaving a state or territory to form a separate territory or new state, or to the severing of an area from a city or county within a state. Advocates for secession are called '''disunionists''' by their contemporaries in various historical documents.\n\nThreats and aspirations to secede from the United States, or arguments justifying secession, have been a feature of the country's politics almost since its birth. Some have argued for secession as a [[constitutional right]] and others as from a [[Right of revolution|natural right of revolution]]. In ''[[Texas v. White]]'', the United States Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession unconstitutional, while commenting that revolution or consent of the states could lead to a successful secession.\n\nThe most serious attempt at secession was advanced in the years 1860 and 1861 as eleven southern states each declared secession from the United States, and joined together to form the [[Confederate States of America]]. This movement collapsed in 1865 with the defeat of Confederate forces by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] armies in the [[American Civil War]].{{sfn|Gienapp|2002}}\n\n==The American Revolution==\nThe [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] states:\n\n{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created ugly as heck(especially the founding fathers), that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u2014That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]],\u2014That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, ''it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government'', laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.{{sfn|Maier|1997|p=135}} }}\n\nHistorian [[Pauline Maier]] argues that this narrative asserted \"... the right of revolution, which was, after all, the right Americans were exercising in 1776\"; and notes that [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s language incorporated ideas explained at length by a long list of seventeenth-century writers including [[John Milton]], [[Algernon Sidney]], and [[John Locke]] and other English and Scottish commentators, all of whom had contributed to the development of the [[Whiggism|Whig]] tradition in eighteenth-century Britain.{{sfn|Maier|1997|p=135}}\n\nThe right of revolution expressed in the Declaration was immediately followed with the observation that long-practised injustice is tolerated until sustained assaults on the rights of the entire people have accumulated enough force to oppress them;<ref>J Jayne, Allen, Op.

Wood]] quotes [[John Adams]]: \"Only repeated, multiplied oppressions placing it beyond all doubt that their rulers had formed settled plans to deprive them of their liberties, could warrant the concerted resistance of the people against their government\".{{sfn|Wood|1969|p=40}}\n\n==Civil War era political and legal views on secession==\n\n===Overview===\n\nWith origins in the question of [[states' rights]] the issue of secession was argued in many forums and advocated from time to time in both the North and South in the decades after adopting the Constitution and before the [[American Civil War]]. Historian Maury Klein described the contemporary debate: \"Was the Republic a unified nation in which the individual states had merged their sovereign rights and identities forever, or was it a federation of sovereign states joined together for specific purposes from which they could withdraw at any time?\"{{sfn|Klein|1997|pp=32\u201333}} He observed that \"the case can be made that no result of the [American Civil] war was more important than the destruction, once and for all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of the idea of secession\".{{sfn|Klein|1997|p=xii}}\n\nHistorian [[Forrest McDonald]] argued that after adopting the Constitution \"there were no guidelines, either in theory or in history, as to whether the compact could be dissolved and, if so, on what conditions\". However, during \"the founding era, many a public figure .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;declared that the states could interpose their powers between their citizens and the power of the federal government, and talk of secession was not unknown\". But according to McDonald, to avoid resorting to the violence that had accompanied the Revolution, the Constitution established \"legitimate means for constitutional change in the future\". In effect, the Constitution \"completed and perfected the Revolution\".{{sfn|McDonald|1985|pp=281\u201382}}\n\nWhatever the intentions of the Founders, threats of secession and disunion were a constant in the political discourse of Americans preceding the Civil War. Historian [[Elizabeth R. Varon]] wrote:\n\n{{Quote|... one word [disunion] contained, and stimulated, their [Americans] fears of extreme political factionalism, tyranny, regionalism, economic decline, foreign intervention, class conflict, gender disorder, racial strife, widespread violence and anarchy, and civil war, all of which could be interpreted as God's retribution for America's moral failings. Disunion connoted the dissolution of the republic\u2014the failure of the Founders' efforts to establish a stable and lasting representative government. For many Americans in the North and the South, disunion was a nightmare, a tragic cataclysm that would reduce them to the kind of fear and misery that seemed to pervade the rest of the world. And yet, for many other Americans, disunion served as the main instrument by which they could achieve their political goals.{{sfn|Varon|2008|pp=1\u20132}} }}\n\n===Abandoning the Articles of Confederation===\nIn late 1777 the Second Continental Congress approved the [[Articles of Confederation]] for ratification by the individual states. The confederation government was administered [[de facto]] by the Congress under the provisions of the approved (final) draft of the Articles until they achieved ratification\u2014and [[de jure]] status\u2014in early 1781. In 1786 delegates of five states (the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]]) called for a convention of delegates in Philadelphia to amend the Articles\u2014which would require unanimous consent of the thirteen states.\n\nThe delegates to the [[Philadelphia Convention]] convened and deliberated from May to September 1787. Instead of pursuing their official charge they returned a draft (new) [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]], proposed for constructing and administering a new federal\u2014later also known as \"national\"\u2014government. They further proposed that the draft Constitution ''not'' be submitted to the Congress (where it would require unanimous approval of the states); instead that it be presented directly to the states for ratification in special ratification conventions, and that approval by a minimum of nine state conventions would suffice to adopt the new Constitution and initiate the new federal government; and that only those states ratifying the Constitution would be included in the new government. (For a time, eleven of the original states operated under the Constitution without two non-ratifying states, Rhode Island and North Carolina.) In effect, the delegates proposed to abandon and replace the Articles of Confederation rather than amend them.{{efn|St. George Tucker wrote \"The dissolution of these systems [any confederacy of states] happens, when all the confederates by mutual consent, or some of them, voluntarily abandon the confederacy, and govern their own states apart; or a part of them form a different league and confederacy among each other, and withdraw themselves from the confederacy with the rest. Such was the proceeding on the part of those of the American states which first adopted the present constitution of the United States . . . leaving the states of [[Rhode Island]] and [[North Carolina]], both of which, at first, rejected the new constitution, to themselves.{{sfn|Wilson|p=84}} }}\n\nBecause the Articles had specified a \"perpetual union\", various arguments have been offered to explain the apparent contradiction (and presumed illegality) of abandoning one form of government and creating another that did not include the members of the original.{{efn|Tucker wrote that this was an evident breach of the Articles of Confederation; because they stipulated that \"those 'articles should be inviolably observed by every state, and that union should be perpetual; nor should any alteration at any time thereafter be made in any of them, unless such alterations be agreed to in the congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every state.'\" (Tucker quoting from the Articles of Confederation). \"Yet the seceding states, as they may not be improperly termed, did not hesitate, as soon as nine states had ratified the new constitution, to supersede the former federal government and establish a new form, more consonant to their opinion of what was necessary to the preservation and prosperity of the federal union.\"{{sfn|Wilson|p=84}} }} One explanation was that the Articles of Confederation simply failed to protect the vital interests of the individual states. Necessity then, rather than legality, was the practical factor in abandoning the Articles.{{sfn|Amar|2005|p=30}}\n\nAccording to historian [[John Ferling]], by 1786 the Union under the Articles was falling apart. [[James Madison]] of Virginia and [[Alexander Hamilton]] of New York\u2014they who joined together to vigorously promote a new Constitution\u2014urged that renewed stability of the Union government was critically needed to protect property and commerce. Both founders were strong advocates for a more powerful central government; they published ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' to advocate their cause and became known as the [[Federalists#United States|federalists]]. (Because of his powerful advocacy Madison was later accorded the honorific \"Father of the Constitution\".){{efn|Of Madison, Ferling wrote that he was \"resolute about protecting the propertied class from what he believed were the democratic excesses of the American Revolution and, at the same time, guarding Southern interests, which to a considerable extent meant preserving the well being of slaveholders against a Northern majority\".  Of Hamilton, Ferling wrote, \"His principal aim, according to his biographer Forrest McDonald, was to lay groundwork for enhanced Congressional authority over commerce.\"{{sfn|Ferling|2003|pp=273\u201374}} }} Ferling wrote:\n\n{{quote|Rumors of likely secessionist movements were unleashed. There was buzz as well that some states planned to abandon the American Union and form a regional confederacy. America, it was said, would go the way of Europe, and ultimately three or four, or more confederacies would spring up. ... Not only would these confederations be capable of taking steps that were beyond the ability of Congress under the articles, but in private some portrayed such a step in a positive light, in as much as the regional union could adopt constitutions that secured property rights and maintained order.{{efn|Ferling notes that [[John Jay]] wrote to George Washington that \"Errors in our national Government ... threaten the Fruit we expected from our 'Tree of Liberty'. Ferling wrote of Henry Lee that he spoke of the \"contempt with which America was held in Europe\" (Ferling's words) and the dangers that the country's \"degrading supiness\" (Lee's words) presented to preservation of the nation.{{sfn|Ferling|2003|p=274}} }} }}\n\nOther arguments that justified abandoning the Articles of Confederation pictured the Articles as an ''international'' compact between ''unconsolidated'', ''sovereign'' states, any one of which was empowered to renounce the compact at will. (This as opposed to a ''consolidated'' union that \"totally annihilated, without any power of revival\" the sovereign states.){{sfn|Amar|2005|p=31|ps=: The quoted material is from Blackstone's \"Commentaries\".}} The Articles  required that all states were obliged to comply with all requirements of the agreement; thus, permanence was linked to compliance.\n\n'Compliance' was typically perceived as a matter of interpretation by each individual state. [[Emerich de Vattel]], a recognized authority on international law, wrote at the time that \"Treaties contain promises that are perfect and reciprocal. If one of the allies fails in his engagements, the other may ... disengage himself in his promises, and ... break the treaty.\"{{sfn|Amar|2005|p=31|ps=: The quoted material is from Blackstone's \"Commentaries\".}} Thus, each state could unilaterally 'secede' from the Articles of Confederation at will; this argument for abandoning the Articles\u2014for its weakness in the face of secession\u2014was used by advocates for the new Constitution and was featured by [[James Madison]] in [[Federalist No. 43]].{{efn|From Federalist 43: A compact between independent sovereigns, founded on ordinary acts of Legislative authority, can pretend to no higher validity than a league or treaty between the parties. It is an established doctrine on the subject of treaties, that all the Articles are mutually conditions of each other; that a breach of any one Article is a breach of the whole treaty; and that a breach, committed by either of the parties, absolves the others, and authorizes them, if they please, to pronounce the compact violated and void. Should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to these delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with the consent of particular States to a dissolution of the federal pact, will not the complaining parties find it a difficult task to answer the multiplied and important infractions with which they may be confronted?<ref>{{harvnb|Amar|2005|p=31}}</ref> }}\n\nSome{{who|date=December 2016}} argued that abandoning the Articles was the same as seceding from the Articles and thus was legal precedent for future secession(s) from the Constitution. [[St. George Tucker]], a jurist in the early republic era, wrote in 1803:\n\n{{quote|sign=|source=|And since the seceding states, by establishing a new constitution and form of federal government among themselves, without the consent of the rest, have shown that they consider the right to do so whenever the occasion may, in their opinion require it, we may infer that the right has not been diminished by any new compact which they may since have entered into, since none could be more solemn or explicit than the first, nor more binding upon the contracting partie[s].\"{{sfn|Wilson|pp=85\u201386}} }}\n\nOthers denied that such a precedent was set; constitutional historian Akhil Reed Amar wrote:\n\n{{quote|The fact that a new union was lawfully formed in the 1780s by secession from the old confederacy did not mean that a new confederacy could be lawfully formed in the 1860s by secession from the old union. ...\n\nWriting in 1824, exactly midway between the fall of the Articles of Confederation and the rise of a second self-described American Confederacy, [[John Marshall|[Chief Justice John] Marshall]] summarized the issue nicely: \"Reference has been made to the political situation of these states, anterior to [the Constitution's] formation. It has been said that they were sovereign, were completely independent, and were connected with each other only by a league. This is true. But, when these allied sovereigns converted their league into a government, when they converted their congress of ambassadors, deputed to deliberate on their common concerns, and to recommend measures of general utility, into a legislature, empowered to enact laws on the most interesting subjects, the whole character in which the states appear underwent a change.\"{{sfn|Amar|2005|p=39|ps=: quoting ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1 (1824).}} }}\n\nOthers{{who|date=December 2016}} argued the opposite of secession; that indeed the new Constitution inherited ''perpetuity'' from the language in the Articles and from other actions done prior to the Constitution. Historian Kenneth Stampp explains their view:\n\n{{quote|Lacking an explicit clause in the Constitution with which to establish the Union's perpetuity, the nationalists made their case, ''first'', with a unique interpretation of the history of the country prior to the Philadelphia Convention; ''second'', with inferences drawn from certain passages of the Constitution; and ''third'', with careful selections from the speeches and writings of the Founding Fathers. The historical case begins with the postulate that the Union is older than the states. It quotes the reference in the Declaration of Independence to \"these united colonies\", contends that the Second Continental Congress actually called the states into being [i.e., \"colonies\" no longer], notes the provision for a perpetual Union in the Articles of Confederation, and ends with the reminder that the preamble to the new Constitution gives as one of its purposes the formation of \"a more perfect Union\".{{sfn|Stampp|1978|p=6}} }}\n\n===Adopting the Constitution===\n{{Debate|section|date=February 2017}}\n\nConstitutional scholar [[Akhil Reed Amar]] argues that the permanence of the Union of the states changed significantly when the [[U.S. Constitution]] replaced the [[Articles of Confederation]]. This action \"signaled its decisive break with the Articles' regime of state sovereignty\".{{sfn|Amar|2005|pp=29\u201332}} By adopting a constitution\u2014rather than a treaty, or a compact, or an instrument of confederacy, etc.\u2014that created a new body of government designed to be senior to the several states, and by approving the particular language and provisions of that new Constitution, the framers and voters made it clear that the fates of the individual states were (severely) changed; and that the new United States was:\n\n{{quote|Not a \"league\", however firm; not a \"confederacy\" or a \"confederation\"; not a compact on among \"sovereign' states\"\u2014all these high profile and legally freighted words from the Articles were conspicuously absent from the Preamble and every other operative part of the Constitution. The new text proposed a fundamentally different legal framework.{{sfn|Amar|2005|p=33}} }}\n\n[[Patrick Henry]] adamantly opposed adopting the Constitution because he interpreted its language to replace the sovereignty of the individual states, including that of his own Virginia. He gave his strong voice to the anti-federalist cause in opposition to the [[federalists]] led by [[James Madison|Madison]] and [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]]. Questioning the nature of the proposed new federal government, Henry asked:\n\n{{quote|The fate ... of America may depend on this. ... Have they made a proposal of a compact between the states? If they had, this would be a confederation. It is otherwise most clearly a consolidated government. The question turns, sir, on that poor little thing\u2014the expression, We, the ''people'', instead of the ''states'', of America. ...{{sfn|Amar|2005|p=35}} }}\n\nThe federalists acknowledged that ''national'' sovereignty would be transferred by the new Constitution to the whole of the American people\u2014indeed, regard the expression, ''\"We the people&nbsp;...\"''. They argued, however, that Henry exaggerated the extent to which a consolidated government was being created and that the states would serve a vital role within the new republic even though their national sovereignty was ending. Tellingly, on the matter of whether states retained a right to unilaterally secede from the United States, the federalists made it clear that no such right would exist under the Constitution.{{sfn|Amar|2005|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nAmar specifically cites the example of New York's ratification as suggestive that the Constitution did not countenance secession. [[Anti-federalists]] dominated the [[Poughkeepsie Convention]] that would ratify the Constitution. Concerned that the new compact might not sufficiently safeguard states' rights, the anti-federalists sought to insert into the New York ratification message language to the effect that \"there should be reserved to the state of New York a right to withdraw herself from the union after a certain number of years.\"<ref name=\"amarny\">{{cite news|first=Akhil Reed |last=Amar |title=Conventional Wisdom |date=September 19, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/opinion/conventional-wisdom.html |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=May 29, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529184850/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/opinion/conventional-wisdom.html |archivedate=May 29, 2015 }}</ref> The Madison federalists opposed this, with Hamilton, a delegate at the Convention, reading aloud in response a letter from James Madison stating: \"the Constitution requires an adoption ''in toto, and for ever''\" [emphasis added].

Moreover, it makes clear that a state may be bound by a federal constitutional amendment even if that state votes against the amendment in a properly convened state convention. And this rule is flatly inconsistent with the idea that states remain sovereign after joining the Constitution, even if they were sovereign before joining it.

Law professor [[Daniel A. Farber|Daniel Farber]] defined what he considered the borders of this debate:\n\n{{quote|What about the original understanding? The debates contain scattered statements about the permanence or impermanence of the Union. The occasional reference to the impermanency of the Constitution are hard to interpret. They might have referred to a legal right to revoke ratification. But they equally could have referred to an extraconstitutional right of revolution, or to the possibility that a new national convention would rewrite the Constitution, or simply to the factual possibility that the national government might break down. Similarly, references to the permanency of the Union could have referred to the practical unlikelihood of withdrawal rather than any lack of legal power. The public debates seemingly do not speak specifically to whether ratification under Article VII was revocable.{{sfn|Farber|2003|p=87}} }}\n\nIn the public debate over the [[Nullification Crisis]] the separate issue of secession was also discussed. [[James Madison]], often referred to as \"The Father of the Constitution\", strongly opposed the argument that secession was permitted by the Constitution.{{sfn|Ketcham|1990|pp=644\u201346}} In a March 15, 1833, letter to [[Daniel Webster]] (congratulating him on a speech opposing nullification), Madison discussed \"revolution\" versus \"secession\":\n\n{{quote|I return my thanks for the copy of your late very powerful Speech in the Senate of the United S. It crushes \"nullification\" and must hasten the abandonment of \"Secession\". But this dodges the blow by confounding the claim to secede at will, with the right of seceding from intolerable oppression. The former answers itself, being a violation, without cause, of a faith solemnly pledged. The latter is another name only for revolution, about which there is no theoretic controversy.<ref>{{cite web |work=The Founder's Constitution |url= http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch3s14.html |title= Volume 1, Chapter 3, Document 14: James Madison to Daniel Webster |date=March 18, 1833 |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |access-date=September 16, 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nThus Madison affirms an ''extra''constitutional right to revolt against conditions of \"intolerable oppression\"; but if the case cannot be made (that such conditions exist), then he rejects secession\u2014as a violation of the Constitution.\n\nDuring the crisis, President [[Andrew Jackson]], published his [[Proclamation to the People of South Carolina]], which made a case for the perpetuity of the Union; plus, he provided his views re the questions of \"revolution\" and \"secession\":{{sfn|Remini|1984|p=21}}\n\n{{quote|But each State having expressly parted with so many powers as to constitute jointly with the other States a single nation, ''cannot from that period possess any right to secede'', because such secession does not break a league, but destroys the unity of a nation, and any injury to that unity is not only a breach which would result from the contravention of a compact, but it is an offense against the whole Union. [emphasis added] To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union, is to say that the United States are not a nation because it would be a solecism to contend that any part of a nation might dissolve its connection with the other parts, to their injury or ruin, without committing any offense. Secession, like any other revolutionary act, may be morally justified by the extremity of oppression; but to call it a constitutional right, is confounding the meaning of terms, and can only be done through gross error, or to deceive those who are willing to assert a right, but would pause before they made a revolution, or incur the penalties consequent upon a failure.<ref>{{cite web |work=The [[Avalon Project]] |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/jack01.asp |title=President Jackson's Proclamation Regarding Nullification |date=December 10, 1832 |publisher=[[Yale Law School]] |access-date=September 16, 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nSome twenty-eight years after Jackson spoke, President [[James Buchanan]] gave a different voice\u2014one much more accommodating to the views of the secessionists and the 'slave' states\u2014in the midst of the [[American Civil War|pre-War]] secession crisis. In his final [[State of the Union address]] to Congress, on December 3, 1860, he acknowledged his view that the South, \"after having first used all peaceful and constitutional means to obtain redress, would be justified in revolutionary resistance to the Government of the Union\"; but he also drew his apocalyptic vision of the results to be expected from secession:{{sfn|Farber|2003|pp=87\u201388}}\n\n{{quote|''In order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy'', it must be on the principle that the Federal Government is a mere voluntary association of States, to be dissolved at pleasure by any one of the contracting parties.

He argued\u2014as one of many vociferous responses by the [[Jeffersonian Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]]\u2014the sense of the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]], adopted in 1798 and 1799, which reserved to those States the rights of secession and interposition (nullification).{{sfn|Stromberg|1982|p=42}}\n\n[[Thomas Jefferson]], while sitting as Vice President of the United States in 1799, wrote to [[James Madison]] of his conviction in \"a reservation of th[ose] rights resulting to us from these palpable violations [the Alien and Sedition Acts]\" and, ''if the federal government did not return to''\n\n{{quote|\"the true principles of our federal compact, [''he'' was determined to] ''sever ourselves from that union'' we so much value, rather than give up the rights of self government which we have reserved, and in which alone we see liberty, safety and happiness.\"[emphasis added]{{sfn|Smith|1995|p=1119}} }}\n\nHere Jefferson is arguing in a radical voice (and in a private letter) that he would lead a movement for secession; but it is unclear whether he is arguing for \"secession at will\" or for \"revolution\" on account of \"intolerable oppression\" (see above), or neither. Jefferson secretly wrote (one of) the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions|Kentucky Resolutions]], which was done\u2014again\u2014while he was holding the office of Vice President. His biographer [[Dumas Malone]] argued that, had his actions become known at the time, Jefferson's participation might have gotten him impeached for (charged with) treason.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=586}} In writing the first Kentucky Resolution, Jefferson warned that, \"unless arrested at the threshold\", the Alien and Sedition Acts would \"necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood\". Historian [[Ron Chernow]] says of this \"he wasn't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: he was calling for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government of which he was vice president.\" Jefferson \"thus set forth a radical doctrine of states' rights that effectively undermined the constitution\".{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=587}}\n\nJeffersonian Republicans were not alone in claiming \"reserved rights\" against the federal government. Contributing to the rancorous debates during the War of 1812, [[Founding Father]] [[Gouverneur Morris]] of Pennsylvania and New York\u2014a Federalist, a Hamilton ally and a primary author of the Constitution who advanced the concept that Americans were citizens of a single Union of the states\u2014was persuaded to claim that \"secession, under certain circumstances, was entirely constitutional.\"{{sfn|McDonald|1985|p=281|ps=: (citing Morris, \"Address to the People of the State of New York\" (1814), et al.) }}\n\n===New England Federalists and the Hartford Convention===\nThe election of 1800 showed Jefferson's [[Democratic-Republican Party]] to be on the rise and the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] to be declining, and the Federalists felt threatened by initiatives taken by their opponents. They viewed Jefferson's unilateral purchase of the [[Louisiana Purchase|Louisiana territory]] as violating foundational agreements between the original 13 states; Jefferson transacted the purchase in secret and refused to seek the approval of Congress. The new lands anticipated several future western states which the Federalists feared would be dominated by the Democratic-Republicans. Other things added to the Federalists' alarm, such as the impeachment of Federalist district judge [[John Pickering (judge)|John Pickering]] by the Jeffersonian-dominated Congress, and similar attacks on Pennsylvania state officials by the Democratic-Republican legislature. By 1804, their national leadership was decimated and their viable base was reduced to the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Delaware.{{sfn|Buel|2005|pp=22\u201323}}\n\n[[Timothy Pickering]] of Massachusetts and a few Federalists envisioned creating a separate New England confederation, possibly combining with lower Canada to form a new pro-British nation. The [[Embargo Act of 1807]] was seen as a threat to the economy of Massachusetts, and the state legislature debated in May 1808 how the state should respond. These debates generated isolated references to secession, but no definite plot materialized.{{sfn|Buel|2005|pp=44\u201358}} Historian Richard Buell, Jr. suggests that \"the secessionist movement of 1804 was more of a confession of despair about the future than a realistic proposal for action.\"{{sfn|Buel|2005|p=23}}\n\nFederalist party members convened the [[Hartford Convention]] on December 15, 1814, and they addressed their opposition to the continuing [[War of 1812|war with Britain]] and the domination of the federal government by the \"Virginia dynasty\". Twenty six delegates attended; Massachusetts sent 12, Connecticut seven, and Rhode Island four. New Hampshire and Vermont declined, but two counties each from those states sent delegates.{{sfn|Hickey|1997|p=233}} Historian Donald R. Hickey notes:\n\n{{quote|Despite pleas in the New England press for secession and a separate peace, most of the delegates taking part in the Hartford Convention were determined to pursue a moderate course. Only [[Timothy Bigelow (lawyer)|Timothy Bigelow]] of Massachusetts apparently favored extreme measures, and he did not play a major role in the proceedings.{{sfn|Hickey|1997|p=233}} }}\n\nThe final report addressed issues related to the war and state defense, and it recommended several amendments to the Constitution.<ref>{{cite web |title=Amendments to the Constitution Proposed by the Hartford Convention : 1814 |website=The Avalon Project |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/hartconv.asp |access-date=September 16, 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Hickey|1997|pp=233\u201334}} Massachusetts and Connecticut endorsed it, but the war ended as the delegates were returning to Washington, effectively quashing any impact that it might have had. The Jeffersonians described the convention as \"a synonym for disloyalty and treason\", and it became a major factor in the sharp decline of the Federalist Party.{{sfn|Hickey|1997|p=234}}\n\n===Abolitionists for secession===\n[[File:william garrison.jpg|thumb|130px|William Lloyd Garrison\u2014\"Henceforth, the watchword of every uncompromising abolitionist, of every friend of God and liberty, must be, both in a religious and political sense \u2014 'NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS'\"{{sfn|Cain|1995|p=115}}]]\n\nTensions began to rise between north and south by the late 1830s over slavery and related issues. Many northerners saw themselves as political victims of conspiracies between slaveholders and western expansionists, especially New Englanders. They viewed the movements to [[Texas annexation|annex Texas]] and to make war on Mexico as fomented by slaveholders bent on dominating western expansion and thereby the national destiny. New England abolitionist [[Benjamin Lundy]] argued that the annexation of Texas was \"a long premeditated crusade\u2014set on foot by slaveholders, land speculators, etc., with the view of reestablishing, extending, and perpetuating the system of slavery and the slave trade\".{{sfn|Sibley|2005|p=117}}\n\nNewspaper editors began demanding separation from the south. [[William Lloyd Garrison]] called for secession in ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' of May 1844 with his \"Address to the Friends of Freedom and Emancipation in the United States\". The Constitution was created, he wrote, \"at the expense of the colored population of the country\", and Southerners were dominating the nation because of the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]]; now it was time \"to set the captive free by the potency of truth\" and to \"secede from the government\".{{sfn|Mayer|1998|p=327}} Coincidentally, the New England Anti-Slavery Convention endorsed the principles of disunion by a vote of 250\u201324.{{sfn|Mayer|1998|p=328}}\n\nSupport of secession began to shift to Southern states from 1846, after introduction of the [[Wilmot Proviso]] into the public debate. Southern leaders increasingly felt helpless against a powerful political group that was attacking their interests, reminiscent of Federalist alarms at the beginning of the century.\n\n===South Carolina===\nDuring the presidential term of [[Andrew Jackson]], [[South Carolina]] had its own [[Nullification Crisis|semi-secession movement]] due to the 1828 \"[[Tariff of Abominations]]\", which threatened both South Carolina's economy and the Union. Andrew Jackson also threatened to send federal troops to put down the movement and to hang the leader of the secessionists from the highest tree in South Carolina. Also due to this, Jackson's vice president, [[John C. Calhoun]], who supported the movement and wrote the essay \"The [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]]\", became the first US vice-president to resign. On May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote of nullification, \"the [[Tariff of 1832|tariff]] was only a pretext, and [[Union (American Civil War)|disunion]] and [[Confederate States of America|southern confederacy]] the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] question.\"{{sfn|Meacham|2009|p=247}} South Carolina also threatened to secede in 1850 over the issue of California's statehood. It became the first state to declare its secession from the Union on December 20, 1860, with the [[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union]] and later joined with the other Southern states in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].\n\n==Confederate States of America==\n[[File:Confederate States of America.svg|thumb|right|250px|{{legend|#008000|States under CSA control}} {{legend|#bcd35f|States and territories represented in the governments of the USA and CSA}}]]\n:''See main articles [[Origins of the American Civil War]], [[Confederate States of America]] and [[American Civil War]].''\n\nThe most famous secession movement was the case of the Southern states of the United States. Secession from the United States was accepted in eleven states (and failed in two others). The seceding states joined together to form the [[Confederate States of America]] (CSA).\n\nThe eleven states of the CSA, in order of their secession dates (listed in parentheses), were: [[South Carolina]] (December 20, 1860), [[Mississippi]] (January 9, 1861), [[Florida]] (January 10, 1861), [[Alabama]] (January 11, 1861), [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (January 19, 1861), [[Louisiana]] (January 26, 1861), [[Texas]] (February 1, 1861), [[Virginia]] (April 17, 1861), [[Arkansas]] (May 6, 1861), [[North Carolina]] (May 20, 1861), and [[Tennessee]] (June 8, 1861). Secession was declared by pro-Confederate governments in [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]] (see [[Confederate government of Missouri]] and [[Confederate government of Kentucky]]), but did not become effective as it was opposed by their pro-Union state governments.\n\nThis secession movement brought about the [[American Civil War]]. The position of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] was that the Confederacy was not a sovereign nation\u2014and never had been, but that \"the Union\" was always a single nation by intent of the states themselves, from 1776 onward\u2014and thus that a rebellion had been initiated by individuals. Historian [[Bruce Catton]] described President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s April 15, 1861, proclamation after the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]], which defined the Union's position on the hostilities:\n\n{{quote|After reciting the obvious fact that \"combinations too powerful to be suppressed\" by ordinary law courts and marshalls had taken charge of affairs in the seven secessionist states, it announced that the several states of the Union were called on to contribute 75,000 militia \"...to suppress said combinations and to cause the laws to be duly executed.\" ... \"And I hereby command the persons composing the combinations aforesaid to disperse, and retire peacefully to their respective abodes within twenty days from this date.{{sfn|Catton|1961|pp=327\u201328}} }}\n\n==Dubious legality of unilateral secession==\nThe Constitution does not directly mention secession.<ref name=cbs /> The legality of secession was hotly debated in the 19th century.

Mexico refused to recognize its revolted province as an independent country, but the major nations of the world did recognize it. In 1845, Congress admitted Texas as a state. The documents governing Texas' accession to the United States of America do not mention any right of secession\u2014although they did raise the possibility of dividing Texas into multiple states inside the Union. Mexico warned that annexation meant war and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] followed in 1846.{{sfn|Fehrenbach|1968|p=270}}\n\n==Partition of a state==\n[[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: New states|Article IV, Section. 3, Clause 1]] of the United States Constitutions provides:\n\n<blockquote>New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.</blockquote>\n\nThe separation referred to is not secession but partition.

Advocates for secession are called '''disunionists''' by their contemporaries in various historical documents.\n\nThreats and aspirations to secede from the United States, or arguments justifying secession, have been a feature of the country's politics almost since its birth. Some have argued for secession as a [[constitutional right]] and others as from a [[Right of revolution|natural right of revolution]]. In ''[[Texas v. White]]'', the United States Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession unconstitutional, while commenting that revolution or consent of the states could lead to a successful secession.\n\nThe most serious attempt at secession was advanced in the years 1860 and 1861 as eleven southern states each declared secession from the United States, and joined together to form the [[Confederate States of America]]. This movement collapsed in 1865 with the defeat of Confederate forces by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] armies in the [[American Civil War]].{{sfn|Gienapp|2002}}\n\n==The American Revolution==\nThe [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] states:\n\n{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u2014That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]],\u2014That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, ''it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government'', laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.{{sfn|Maier|1997|p=135}} }}\n\nHistorian [[Pauline Maier]] argues that this narrative asserted \"... the right of revolution, which was, after all, the right Americans were exercising in 1776\"; and notes that [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s language incorporated ideas explained at length by a long list of seventeenth-century writers including [[John Milton]], [[Algernon Sidney]], and [[John Locke]] and other English and Scottish commentators, all of whom had contributed to the development of the [[Whiggism|Whig]] tradition in eighteenth-century Britain.{{sfn|Maier|1997|p=135}}\n\nThe right of revolution expressed in the Declaration was immediately followed with the observation that long-practised injustice is tolerated until sustained assaults on the rights of the entire people have accumulated enough force to oppress them;<ref>J Jayne, Allen, Op.

Wood]] quotes [[John Adams]]: \"Only repeated, multiplied oppressions placing it beyond all doubt that their rulers had formed settled plans to deprive them of their liberties, could warrant the concerted resistance of the people against their government\".{{sfn|Wood|1969|p=40}}\n\n==Civil War era political and legal views on secession==\n\n===Overview===\n\nWith origins in the question of [[states' rights]] the issue of secession was argued in many forums and advocated from time to time in both the North and South in the decades after adopting the Constitution and before the [[American Civil War]]. Historian Maury Klein described the contemporary debate: \"Was the Republic a unified nation in which the individual states had merged their sovereign rights and identities forever, or was it a federation of sovereign states joined together for specific purposes from which they could withdraw at any time?\"{{sfn|Klein|1997|pp=32\u201333}} He observed that \"the case can be made that no result of the [American Civil] war was more important than the destruction, once and for all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of the idea of secession\".{{sfn|Klein|1997|p=xii}}\n\nHistorian [[Forrest McDonald]] argued that after adopting the Constitution \"there were no guidelines, either in theory or in history, as to whether the compact could be dissolved and, if so, on what conditions\". However, during \"the founding era, many a public figure .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;declared that the states could interpose their powers between their citizens and the power of the federal government, and talk of secession was not unknown\". But according to McDonald, to avoid resorting to the violence that had accompanied the Revolution, the Constitution established \"legitimate means for constitutional change in the future\". In effect, the Constitution \"completed and perfected the Revolution\".{{sfn|McDonald|1985|pp=281\u201382}}\n\nWhatever the intentions of the Founders, threats of secession and disunion were a constant in the political discourse of Americans preceding the Civil War. Historian [[Elizabeth R. Varon]] wrote:\n\n{{Quote|... one word [disunion] contained, and stimulated, their [Americans] fears of extreme political factionalism, tyranny, regionalism, economic decline, foreign intervention, class conflict, gender disorder, racial strife, widespread violence and anarchy, and civil war, all of which could be interpreted as God's retribution for America's moral failings. Disunion connoted the dissolution of the republic\u2014the failure of the Founders' efforts to establish a stable and lasting representative government. For many Americans in the North and the South, disunion was a nightmare, a tragic cataclysm that would reduce them to the kind of fear and misery that seemed to pervade the rest of the world. And yet, for many other Americans, disunion served as the main instrument by which they could achieve their political goals.{{sfn|Varon|2008|pp=1\u20132}} }}\n\n===Abandoning the Articles of Confederation===\nIn late 1777 the Second Continental Congress approved the [[Articles of Confederation]] for ratification by the individual states. The confederation government was administered [[de facto]] by the Congress under the provisions of the approved (final) draft of the Articles until they achieved ratification\u2014and [[de jure]] status\u2014in early 1781. In 1786 delegates of five states (the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]]) called for a convention of delegates in Philadelphia to amend the Articles\u2014which would require unanimous consent of the thirteen states.\n\nThe delegates to the [[Philadelphia Convention]] convened and deliberated from May to September 1787. Instead of pursuing their official charge they returned a draft (new) [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]], proposed for constructing and administering a new federal\u2014later also known as \"national\"\u2014government. They further proposed that the draft Constitution ''not'' be submitted to the Congress (where it would require unanimous approval of the states); instead that it be presented directly to the states for ratification in special ratification conventions, and that approval by a minimum of nine state conventions would suffice to adopt the new Constitution and initiate the new federal government; and that only those states ratifying the Constitution would be included in the new government. (For a time, eleven of the original states operated under the Constitution without two non-ratifying states, Rhode Island and North Carolina.) In effect, the delegates proposed to abandon and replace the Articles of Confederation rather than amend them.{{efn|St. George Tucker wrote \"The dissolution of these systems [any confederacy of states] happens, when all the confederates by mutual consent, or some of them, voluntarily abandon the confederacy, and govern their own states apart; or a part of them form a different league and confederacy among each other, and withdraw themselves from the confederacy with the rest. Such was the proceeding on the part of those of the American states which first adopted the present constitution of the United States . . . leaving the states of [[Rhode Island]] and [[North Carolina]], both of which, at first, rejected the new constitution, to themselves.{{sfn|Wilson|p=84}} }}\n\nBecause the Articles had specified a \"perpetual union\", various arguments have been offered to explain the apparent contradiction (and presumed illegality) of abandoning one form of government and creating another that did not include the members of the original.{{efn|Tucker wrote that this was an evident breach of the Articles of Confederation; because they stipulated that \"those 'articles should be inviolably observed by every state, and that union should be perpetual; nor should any alteration at any time thereafter be made in any of them, unless such alterations be agreed to in the congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every state.'\" (Tucker quoting from the Articles of Confederation). \"Yet the seceding states, as they may not be improperly termed, did not hesitate, as soon as nine states had ratified the new constitution, to supersede the former federal government and establish a new form, more consonant to their opinion of what was necessary to the preservation and prosperity of the federal union.\"{{sfn|Wilson|p=84}} }} One explanation was that the Articles of Confederation simply failed to protect the vital interests of the individual states. Necessity then, rather than legality, was the practical factor in abandoning the Articles.{{sfn|Amar|2005|p=30}}\n\nAccording to historian [[John Ferling]], by 1786 the Union under the Articles was falling apart. [[James Madison]] of Virginia and [[Alexander Hamilton]] of New York\u2014they who joined together to vigorously promote a new Constitution\u2014urged that renewed stability of the Union government was critically needed to protect property and commerce. Both founders were strong advocates for a more powerful central government; they published ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' to advocate their cause and became known as the [[Federalists#United States|federalists]]. (Because of his powerful advocacy Madison was later accorded the honorific \"Father of the Constitution\".){{efn|Of Madison, Ferling wrote that he was \"resolute about protecting the propertied class from what he believed were the democratic excesses of the American Revolution and, at the same time, guarding Southern interests, which to a considerable extent meant preserving the well being of slaveholders against a Northern majority\".  Of Hamilton, Ferling wrote, \"His principal aim, according to his biographer Forrest McDonald, was to lay groundwork for enhanced Congressional authority over commerce.\"{{sfn|Ferling|2003|pp=273\u201374}} }} Ferling wrote:\n\n{{quote|Rumors of likely secessionist movements were unleashed. There was buzz as well that some states planned to abandon the American Union and form a regional confederacy. America, it was said, would go the way of Europe, and ultimately three or four, or more confederacies would spring up. ... Not only would these confederations be capable of taking steps that were beyond the ability of Congress under the articles, but in private some portrayed such a step in a positive light, in as much as the regional union could adopt constitutions that secured property rights and maintained order.{{efn|Ferling notes that [[John Jay]] wrote to George Washington that \"Errors in our national Government ... threaten the Fruit we expected from our 'Tree of Liberty'. Ferling wrote of Henry Lee that he spoke of the \"contempt with which America was held in Europe\" (Ferling's words) and the dangers that the country's \"degrading supiness\" (Lee's words) presented to preservation of the nation.{{sfn|Ferling|2003|p=274}} }} }}\n\nOther arguments that justified abandoning the Articles of Confederation pictured the Articles as an ''international'' compact between ''unconsolidated'', ''sovereign'' states, any one of which was empowered to renounce the compact at will. (This as opposed to a ''consolidated'' union that \"totally annihilated, without any power of revival\" the sovereign states.){{sfn|Amar|2005|p=31|ps=: The quoted material is from Blackstone's \"Commentaries\".}} The Articles  required that all states were obliged to comply with all requirements of the agreement; thus, permanence was linked to compliance.\n\n'Compliance' was typically perceived as a matter of interpretation by each individual state. [[Emerich de Vattel]], a recognized authority on international law, wrote at the time that \"Treaties contain promises that are perfect and reciprocal. If one of the allies fails in his engagements, the other may ... disengage himself in his promises, and ... break the treaty.\"{{sfn|Amar|2005|p=31|ps=: The quoted material is from Blackstone's \"Commentaries\".}} Thus, each state could unilaterally 'secede' from the Articles of Confederation at will; this argument for abandoning the Articles\u2014for its weakness in the face of secession\u2014was used by advocates for the new Constitution and was featured by [[James Madison]] in [[Federalist No. 43]].{{efn|From Federalist 43: A compact between independent sovereigns, founded on ordinary acts of Legislative authority, can pretend to no higher validity than a league or treaty between the parties. It is an established doctrine on the subject of treaties, that all the Articles are mutually conditions of each other; that a breach of any one Article is a breach of the whole treaty; and that a breach, committed by either of the parties, absolves the others, and authorizes them, if they please, to pronounce the compact violated and void. Should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to these delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with the consent of particular States to a dissolution of the federal pact, will not the complaining parties find it a difficult task to answer the multiplied and important infractions with which they may be confronted?<ref>{{harvnb|Amar|2005|p=31}}</ref> }}\n\nSome{{who|date=December 2016}} argued that abandoning the Articles was the same as seceding from the Articles and thus was legal precedent for future secession(s) from the Constitution. [[St. George Tucker]], a jurist in the early republic era, wrote in 1803:\n\n{{quote|sign=|source=|And since the seceding states, by establishing a new constitution and form of federal government among themselves, without the consent of the rest, have shown that they consider the right to do so whenever the occasion may, in their opinion require it, we may infer that the right has not been diminished by any new compact which they may since have entered into, since none could be more solemn or explicit than the first, nor more binding upon the contracting partie[s].\"{{sfn|Wilson|pp=85\u201386}} }}\n\nOthers denied that such a precedent was set; constitutional historian Akhil Reed Amar wrote:\n\n{{quote|The fact that a new union was lawfully formed in the 1780s by secession from the old confederacy did not mean that a new confederacy could be lawfully formed in the 1860s by secession from the old union. ...\n\nWriting in 1824, exactly midway between the fall of the Articles of Confederation and the rise of a second self-described American Confederacy, [[John Marshall|[Chief Justice John] Marshall]] summarized the issue nicely: \"Reference has been made to the political situation of these states, anterior to [the Constitution's] formation. It has been said that they were sovereign, were completely independent, and were connected with each other only by a league. This is true. But, when these allied sovereigns converted their league into a government, when they converted their congress of ambassadors, deputed to deliberate on their common concerns, and to recommend measures of general utility, into a legislature, empowered to enact laws on the most interesting subjects, the whole character in which the states appear underwent a change.\"{{sfn|Amar|2005|p=39|ps=: quoting ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1 (1824).}} }}\n\nOthers{{who|date=December 2016}} argued the opposite of secession; that indeed the new Constitution inherited ''perpetuity'' from the language in the Articles and from other actions done prior to the Constitution. Historian Kenneth Stampp explains their view:\n\n{{quote|Lacking an explicit clause in the Constitution with which to establish the Union's perpetuity, the nationalists made their case, ''first'', with a unique interpretation of the history of the country prior to the Philadelphia Convention; ''second'', with inferences drawn from certain passages of the Constitution; and ''third'', with careful selections from the speeches and writings of the Founding Fathers. The historical case begins with the postulate that the Union is older than the states. It quotes the reference in the Declaration of Independence to \"these united colonies\", contends that the Second Continental Congress actually called the states into being [i.e., \"colonies\" no longer], notes the provision for a perpetual Union in the Articles of Confederation, and ends with the reminder that the preamble to the new Constitution gives as one of its purposes the formation of \"a more perfect Union\".{{sfn|Stampp|1978|p=6}} }}\n\n===Adopting the Constitution===\n{{Debate|section|date=February 2017}}\n\nConstitutional scholar [[Akhil Reed Amar]] argues that the permanence of the Union of the states changed significantly when the [[U.S. Constitution]] replaced the [[Articles of Confederation]]. This action \"signaled its decisive break with the Articles' regime of state sovereignty\".{{sfn|Amar|2005|pp=29\u201332}} By adopting a constitution\u2014rather than a treaty, or a compact, or an instrument of confederacy, etc.\u2014that created a new body of government designed to be senior to the several states, and by approving the particular language and provisions of that new Constitution, the framers and voters made it clear that the fates of the individual states were (severely) changed; and that the new United States was:\n\n{{quote|Not a \"league\", however firm; not a \"confederacy\" or a \"confederation\"; not a compact on among \"sovereign' states\"\u2014all these high profile and legally freighted words from the Articles were conspicuously absent from the Preamble and every other operative part of the Constitution. The new text proposed a fundamentally different legal framework.{{sfn|Amar|2005|p=33}} }}\n\n[[Patrick Henry]] adamantly opposed adopting the Constitution because he interpreted its language to replace the sovereignty of the individual states, including that of his own Virginia. He gave his strong voice to the anti-federalist cause in opposition to the [[federalists]] led by [[James Madison|Madison]] and [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]]. Questioning the nature of the proposed new federal government, Henry asked:\n\n{{quote|The fate ... of America may depend on this. ... Have they made a proposal of a compact between the states? If they had, this would be a confederation. It is otherwise most clearly a consolidated government. The question turns, sir, on that poor little thing\u2014the expression, We, the ''people'', instead of the ''states'', of America. ...{{sfn|Amar|2005|p=35}} }}\n\nThe federalists acknowledged that ''national'' sovereignty would be transferred by the new Constitution to the whole of the American people\u2014indeed, regard the expression, ''\"We the people&nbsp;...\"''. They argued, however, that Henry exaggerated the extent to which a consolidated government was being created and that the states would serve a vital role within the new republic even though their national sovereignty was ending. Tellingly, on the matter of whether states retained a right to unilaterally secede from the United States, the federalists made it clear that no such right would exist under the Constitution.{{sfn|Amar|2005|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nAmar specifically cites the example of New York's ratification as suggestive that the Constitution did not countenance secession. [[Anti-federalists]] dominated the [[Poughkeepsie Convention]] that would ratify the Constitution. Concerned that the new compact might not sufficiently safeguard states' rights, the anti-federalists sought to insert into the New York ratification message language to the effect that \"there should be reserved to the state of New York a right to withdraw herself from the union after a certain number of years.\"<ref name=\"amarny\">{{cite news|first=Akhil Reed |last=Amar |title=Conventional Wisdom |date=September 19, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/opinion/conventional-wisdom.html |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=May 29, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529184850/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/opinion/conventional-wisdom.html |archivedate=May 29, 2015 }}</ref> The Madison federalists opposed this, with Hamilton, a delegate at the Convention, reading aloud in response a letter from James Madison stating: \"the Constitution requires an adoption ''in toto, and for ever''\" [emphasis added]. Hamilton and [[John Jay]] then told the Convention that in their view, reserving \"a right to withdraw [was] inconsistent with the Constitution, and was no ratification\".<ref name=\"amarny\"/> The New York convention ultimately ratified the Constitution without including the \"right to withdraw\" language proposed by the anti-federalists.\n\nAmar explains how the Constitution impacted on state sovereignty:\n\n{{quote|In dramatic contrast to Article VII\u2013whose unanimity rule that no state can bind another confirms the sovereignty of each state prior to 1787 \u2013 Article V does not permit a single state convention to modify the federal Constitution for itself. Moreover, it makes clear that a state may be bound by a federal constitutional amendment even if that state votes against the amendment in a properly convened state convention. And this rule is flatly inconsistent with the idea that states remain sovereign after joining the Constitution, even if they were sovereign before joining it. Thus, ratification of the Constitution itself marked the moment when previously sovereign states gave up their sovereignty and legal independence.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Amar |first=Akhil Reed |url=https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1837&context=fss_papers |title=David C.

Law professor [[Daniel A. Farber|Daniel Farber]] defined what he considered the borders of this debate:\n\n{{quote|What about the original understanding? The debates contain scattered statements about the permanence or impermanence of the Union. The occasional reference to the impermanency of the Constitution are hard to interpret. They might have referred to a legal right to revoke ratification. But they equally could have referred to an extraconstitutional right of revolution, or to the possibility that a new national convention would rewrite the Constitution, or simply to the factual possibility that the national government might break down. Similarly, references to the permanency of the Union could have referred to the practical unlikelihood of withdrawal rather than any lack of legal power. The public debates seemingly do not speak specifically to whether ratification under Article VII was revocable.{{sfn|Farber|2003|p=87}} }}\n\nIn the public debate over the [[Nullification Crisis]] the separate issue of secession was also discussed. [[James Madison]], often referred to as \"The Father of the Constitution\", strongly opposed the argument that secession was permitted by the Constitution.{{sfn|Ketcham|1990|pp=644\u201346}} In a March 15, 1833, letter to [[Daniel Webster]] (congratulating him on a speech opposing nullification), Madison discussed \"revolution\" versus \"secession\":\n\n{{quote|I return my thanks for the copy of your late very powerful Speech in the Senate of the United S. It crushes \"nullification\" and must hasten the abandonment of \"Secession\". But this dodges the blow by confounding the claim to secede at will, with the right of seceding from intolerable oppression. The former answers itself, being a violation, without cause, of a faith solemnly pledged.

Secession, like any other revolutionary act, may be morally justified by the extremity of oppression; but to call it a constitutional right, is confounding the meaning of terms, and can only be done through gross error, or to deceive those who are willing to assert a right, but would pause before they made a revolution, or incur the penalties consequent upon a failure.<ref>{{cite web |work=The [[Avalon Project]] |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/jack01.asp |title=President Jackson's Proclamation Regarding Nullification |date=December 10, 1832 |publisher=[[Yale Law School]] |access-date=September 16, 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nSome twenty-eight years after Jackson spoke, President [[James Buchanan]] gave a different voice\u2014one much more accommodating to the views of the secessionists and the 'slave' states\u2014in the midst of the [[American Civil War|pre-War]] secession crisis.

He argued\u2014as one of many vociferous responses by the [[Jeffersonian Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]]\u2014the sense of the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]], adopted in 1798 and 1799, which reserved to those States the rights of secession and interposition (nullification).{{sfn|Stromberg|1982|p=42}}\n\n[[Thomas Jefferson]], while sitting as Vice President of the United States in 1799, wrote to [[James Madison]] of his conviction in \"a reservation of th[ose] rights resulting to us from these palpable violations [the Alien and Sedition Acts]\" and, ''if the federal government did not return to''\n\n{{quote|\"the true principles of our federal compact, [''he'' was determined to] ''sever ourselves from that union'' we so much value, rather than give up the rights of self government which we have reserved, and in which alone we see liberty, safety and happiness.\"[emphasis added]{{sfn|Smith|1995|p=1119}} }}\n\nHere Jefferson is arguing in a radical voice (and in a private letter) that he would lead a movement for secession; but it is unclear whether he is arguing for \"secession at will\" or for \"revolution\" on account of \"intolerable oppression\" (see above), or neither. Jefferson secretly wrote (one of) the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions|Kentucky Resolutions]], which was done\u2014again\u2014while he was holding the office of Vice President. His biographer [[Dumas Malone]] argued that, had his actions become known at the time, Jefferson's participation might have gotten him impeached for (charged with) treason.{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=586}} In writing the first Kentucky Resolution, Jefferson warned that, \"unless arrested at the threshold\", the Alien and Sedition Acts would \"necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood\". Historian [[Ron Chernow]] says of this \"he wasn't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: he was calling for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government of which he was vice president.\" Jefferson \"thus set forth a radical doctrine of states' rights that effectively undermined the constitution\".{{sfn|Chernow|2004|p=587}}\n\nJeffersonian Republicans were not alone in claiming \"reserved rights\" against the federal government. Contributing to the rancorous debates during the War of 1812, [[Founding Father]] [[Gouverneur Morris]] of Pennsylvania and New York\u2014a Federalist, a Hamilton ally and a primary author of the Constitution who advanced the concept that Americans were citizens of a single Union of the states\u2014was persuaded to claim that \"secession, under certain circumstances, was entirely constitutional.\"{{sfn|McDonald|1985|p=281|ps=: (citing Morris, \"Address to the People of the State of New York\" (1814), et al.) }}\n\n===New England Federalists and the Hartford Convention===\nThe election of 1800 showed Jefferson's [[Democratic-Republican Party]] to be on the rise and the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] to be declining, and the Federalists felt threatened by initiatives taken by their opponents. They viewed Jefferson's unilateral purchase of the [[Louisiana Purchase|Louisiana territory]] as violating foundational agreements between the original 13 states; Jefferson transacted the purchase in secret and refused to seek the approval of Congress. The new lands anticipated several future western states which the Federalists feared would be dominated by the Democratic-Republicans. Other things added to the Federalists' alarm, such as the impeachment of Federalist district judge [[John Pickering (judge)|John Pickering]] by the Jeffersonian-dominated Congress, and similar attacks on Pennsylvania state officials by the Democratic-Republican legislature. By 1804, their national leadership was decimated and their viable base was reduced to the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Delaware.{{sfn|Buel|2005|pp=22\u201323}}\n\n[[Timothy Pickering]] of Massachusetts and a few Federalists envisioned creating a separate New England confederation, possibly combining with lower Canada to form a new pro-British nation. The [[Embargo Act of 1807]] was seen as a threat to the economy of Massachusetts, and the state legislature debated in May 1808 how the state should respond. These debates generated isolated references to secession, but no definite plot materialized.{{sfn|Buel|2005|pp=44\u201358}} Historian Richard Buell, Jr. suggests that \"the secessionist movement of 1804 was more of a confession of despair about the future than a realistic proposal for action.\"{{sfn|Buel|2005|p=23}}\n\nFederalist party members convened the [[Hartford Convention]] on December 15, 1814, and they addressed their opposition to the continuing [[War of 1812|war with Britain]] and the domination of the federal government by the \"Virginia dynasty\". Twenty six delegates attended; Massachusetts sent 12, Connecticut seven, and Rhode Island four. New Hampshire and Vermont declined, but two counties each from those states sent delegates.{{sfn|Hickey|1997|p=233}} Historian Donald R. Hickey notes:\n\n{{quote|Despite pleas in the New England press for secession and a separate peace, most of the delegates taking part in the Hartford Convention were determined to pursue a moderate course. Only [[Timothy Bigelow (lawyer)|Timothy Bigelow]] of Massachusetts apparently favored extreme measures, and he did not play a major role in the proceedings.{{sfn|Hickey|1997|p=233}} }}\n\nThe final report addressed issues related to the war and state defense, and it recommended several amendments to the Constitution.<ref>{{cite web |title=Amendments to the Constitution Proposed by the Hartford Convention : 1814 |website=The Avalon Project |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/hartconv.asp |access-date=September 16, 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Hickey|1997|pp=233\u201334}} Massachusetts and Connecticut endorsed it, but the war ended as the delegates were returning to Washington, effectively quashing any impact that it might have had. The Jeffersonians described the convention as \"a synonym for disloyalty and treason\", and it became a major factor in the sharp decline of the Federalist Party.{{sfn|Hickey|1997|p=234}}\n\n===Abolitionists for secession===\n[[File:william garrison.jpg|thumb|130px|William Lloyd Garrison\u2014\"Henceforth, the watchword of every uncompromising abolitionist, of every friend of God and liberty, must be, both in a religious and political sense \u2014 'NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS'\"{{sfn|Cain|1995|p=115}}]]\n\nTensions began to rise between north and south by the late 1830s over slavery and related issues. Many northerners saw themselves as political victims of conspiracies between slaveholders and western expansionists, especially New Englanders. They viewed the movements to [[Texas annexation|annex Texas]] and to make war on Mexico as fomented by slaveholders bent on dominating western expansion and thereby the national destiny. New England abolitionist [[Benjamin Lundy]] argued that the annexation of Texas was \"a long premeditated crusade\u2014set on foot by slaveholders, land speculators, etc., with the view of reestablishing, extending, and perpetuating the system of slavery and the slave trade\".{{sfn|Sibley|2005|p=117}}\n\nNewspaper editors began demanding separation from the south. [[William Lloyd Garrison]] called for secession in ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' of May 1844 with his \"Address to the Friends of Freedom and Emancipation in the United States\". The Constitution was created, he wrote, \"at the expense of the colored population of the country\", and Southerners were dominating the nation because of the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]]; now it was time \"to set the captive free by the potency of truth\" and to \"secede from the government\".{{sfn|Mayer|1998|p=327}} Coincidentally, the New England Anti-Slavery Convention endorsed the principles of disunion by a vote of 250\u201324.{{sfn|Mayer|1998|p=328}}\n\nSupport of secession began to shift to Southern states from 1846, after introduction of the [[Wilmot Proviso]] into the public debate. Southern leaders increasingly felt helpless against a powerful political group that was attacking their interests, reminiscent of Federalist alarms at the beginning of the century.\n\n===South Carolina===\nDuring the presidential term of [[Andrew Jackson]], [[South Carolina]] had its own [[Nullification Crisis|semi-secession movement]] due to the 1828 \"[[Tariff of Abominations]]\", which threatened both South Carolina's economy and the Union. Andrew Jackson also threatened to send federal troops to put down the movement and to hang the leader of the secessionists from the highest tree in South Carolina. Also due to this, Jackson's vice president, [[John C. Calhoun]], who supported the movement and wrote the essay \"The [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]]\", became the first US vice-president to resign. On May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote of nullification, \"the [[Tariff of 1832|tariff]] was only a pretext, and [[Union (American Civil War)|disunion]] and [[Confederate States of America|southern confederacy]] the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] question.\"{{sfn|Meacham|2009|p=247}} South Carolina also threatened to secede in 1850 over the issue of California's statehood. It became the first state to declare its secession from the Union on December 20, 1860, with the [[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union]] and later joined with the other Southern states in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].\n\n==Confederate States of America==\n[[File:Confederate States of America.svg|thumb|right|250px|{{legend|#008000|States under CSA control}} {{legend|#bcd35f|States and territories represented in the governments of the USA and CSA}}]]\n:''See main articles [[Origins of the American Civil War]], [[Confederate States of America]] and [[American Civil War]].''\n\nThe most famous secession movement was the case of the Southern states of the United States. Secession from the United States was accepted in eleven states (and failed in two others). The seceding states joined together to form the [[Confederate States of America]] (CSA).\n\nThe eleven states of the CSA, in order of their secession dates (listed in parentheses), were: [[South Carolina]] (December 20, 1860), [[Mississippi]] (January 9, 1861), [[Florida]] (January 10, 1861), [[Alabama]] (January 11, 1861), [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (January 19, 1861), [[Louisiana]] (January 26, 1861), [[Texas]] (February 1, 1861), [[Virginia]] (April 17, 1861), [[Arkansas]] (May 6, 1861), [[North Carolina]] (May 20, 1861), and [[Tennessee]] (June 8, 1861). Secession was declared by pro-Confederate governments in [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]] (see [[Confederate government of Missouri]] and [[Confederate government of Kentucky]]), but did not become effective as it was opposed by their pro-Union state governments.\n\nThis secession movement brought about the [[American Civil War]]. The position of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] was that the Confederacy was not a sovereign nation\u2014and never had been, but that \"the Union\" was always a single nation by intent of the states themselves, from 1776 onward\u2014and thus that a rebellion had been initiated by individuals. Historian [[Bruce Catton]] described President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s April 15, 1861, proclamation after the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]], which defined the Union's position on the hostilities:\n\n{{quote|After reciting the obvious fact that \"combinations too powerful to be suppressed\" by ordinary law courts and marshalls had taken charge of affairs in the seven secessionist states, it announced that the several states of the Union were called on to contribute 75,000 militia \"...to suppress said combinations and to cause the laws to be duly executed.\" ... \"And I hereby command the persons composing the combinations aforesaid to disperse, and retire peacefully to their respective abodes within twenty days from this date.{{sfn|Catton|1961|pp=327\u201328}} }}\n\n==Dubious legality of unilateral secession==\nThe Constitution does not directly mention secession.<ref name=cbs /> The legality of secession was hotly debated in the 19th century.

Mexico refused to recognize its revolted province as an independent country, but the major nations of the world did recognize it. In 1845, Congress admitted Texas as a state. The documents governing Texas' accession to the United States of America do not mention any right of secession\u2014although they did raise the possibility of dividing Texas into multiple states inside the Union. Mexico warned that annexation meant war and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] followed in 1846.{{sfn|Fehrenbach|1968|p=270}}\n\n==Partition of a state==\n[[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: New states|Article IV, Section. 3, Clause 1]] of the United States Constitutions provides:\n\n<blockquote>New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.</blockquote>\n\nThe separation referred to is not secession but partition.

Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/obsessive-compulsive-disorder.|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, (2005) |accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with [[antibacterial soap]] and hot water can make their skin red and raw with [[dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |title=Hygiene of the Skin: When Is Clean Too Clean?

For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is ''still'' not sure and deems it is ''still'' better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue for as long as necessary.\n\n=== Insight ===\nThe DSM-V contains three specifiers for the level of insight in OCD. Good or fair insight is characterized by the acknowledgment that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are or may not be true. Poor insight is characterized by the belief that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are probably true. Absence of insight makes obsessive-compulsive beliefs [[delusion]]al thoughts, and occurs in about 4% of people with OCD.<ref name=\"Sadock\">{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=P|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|last2=Sadock|first2=B|last3=Sadock|first3=V|publisher=LWW|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|edition=10th|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Overvalued ideas ===\nSome people with OCD exhibit what is known as ''overvalued ideas''. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do [[Exposure and response prevention|ERP therapy]] on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially. There are severe cases in which the person has an unshakable belief in the context of OCD that is difficult to differentiate from [[psychosis|psychotic disorders]].<ref>O'Dwyer, Anne-Marie Carter, Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder and delusions revisited, The British Journal of Psychiatry (2000) 176: 281\u2013284</ref>\n\n=== Cognitive performance ===\nThough it was once believed to be associated with above-average intelligence, this does not appear to be the case.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Abramovitch Amitai|last2=Anholt Gideon|last3=Raveh-Gottfried Sagi|last4=Hamo Naama|last5=Abramowitz Jonathan S|year=2017|title=Meta-Analysis of Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|url=|journal=Neuropsychology Review|volume=28|issue=1|pages=111\u2013120|doi=10.1007/s11065-017-9358-0|pmid=28864868}}</ref> A 2013 review reported that people with OCD have mild but wide-ranging cognitive deficits; significantly regarding [[spatial memory]], to a lesser extent with [[verbal memory]], [[Verbal fluency test|fluency]], executive function, and processing speed, while auditory attention was not significantly affected.<ref name=shin>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shin NY, Lee TY, Kim E, Kwon JS | title = Cognitive functioning in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Medicine | pages = 1121\u20131130 | date = 19 July 2013 | pmid = 23866289 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291713001803 | volume=44| issue = 6 }}</ref> People with OCD show impairment in formulating an organizational strategy for coding information, set-shifting, and motor and cognitive inhibition.<ref name=\"Aydin\">{{cite journal |vauthors=\u00c7etinay Ayd\u0131n P, G\u00fcle\u00e7 \u00d6yek\u00e7in D | title = Cognitive functions in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder | journal = Turk Psikiyatri Dergisi (Turkish Journal of Psychiatry) | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 266\u201374 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24310094 | doi=10.5080/u7172}}</ref>\n\nSpecific subtypes of symptom dimensions in OCD have been associated with specific cognitive deficits.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pauls|first1=DL|last2=Abramovitch|first2=A|last3=Rauch|first3=SL|last4=Geller|first4=DA|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder: an integrative genetic and neurobiological perspective.|journal=Nature Reviews.

To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] range of worries about conventional problems.<ref name=\"Quick\">''Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR''. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.</ref> A person may attempt to ignore or [[Thought suppression|suppress]] such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational.\n\nCompulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD ''must'' perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive.\n\nMoreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational or scholastic functioning.<ref name=\"Quick\" /> It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the person's estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, concrete tools can be used to gauge the person's condition. This may be done with rating scales, such as the [[Yale\u2013Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized.<ref name=\"Fenske_2009\" />\n\nOCD is sometimes placed in a group of disorders called the [[obsessive\u2013compulsive spectrum]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Starcevic|first1=V|last2=Janca|first2=A|title=Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders: still in search of the concept-affirming boundaries.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=January 2011|volume=24|issue=1|pages=55\u201360|pmid=20827198|doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e32833f3b58}}</ref>\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\nOCD is often confused with the separate condition [[obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD).

At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly \"contaminated\" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a \"contaminated\" location, such as a school). That is the \"exposure\". The \"ritual prevention\" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly [[Habituation|habituates]] to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level drops considerably; they can then progress to touching something more \"contaminated\" or not checking the lock at all\u2014again, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.<ref name=\"baojournal.com\">Huppert & Roth: (2003) Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Exposure and Response Prevention.

Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/obsessive-compulsive-disorder.|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, (2005) |accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with [[antibacterial soap]] and hot water can make their skin red and raw with [[dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |title=Hygiene of the Skin: When Is Clean Too Clean?

For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is ''still'' not sure and deems it is ''still'' better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue for as long as necessary.\n\n=== Insight ===\nThe DSM-V contains three specifiers for the level of insight in OCD. Good or fair insight is characterized by the acknowledgment that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are or may not be true. Poor insight is characterized by the belief that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are probably true. Absence of insight makes obsessive-compulsive beliefs [[delusion]]al thoughts, and occurs in about 4% of people with OCD.<ref name=\"Sadock\">{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=P|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|last2=Sadock|first2=B|last3=Sadock|first3=V|publisher=LWW|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|edition=10th|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Overvalued ideas ===\nSome people with OCD exhibit what is known as ''overvalued ideas''. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do [[Exposure and response prevention|ERP therapy]] on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially.

To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] range of worries about conventional problems.<ref name=\"Quick\">''Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR''. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.</ref> A person may attempt to ignore or [[Thought suppression|suppress]] such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational.\n\nCompulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD ''must'' perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive.\n\nMoreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational or scholastic functioning.<ref name=\"Quick\" /> It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the person's estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, concrete tools can be used to gauge the person's condition. This may be done with rating scales, such as the [[Yale\u2013Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized.<ref name=\"Fenske_2009\" />\n\nOCD is sometimes placed in a group of disorders called the [[obsessive\u2013compulsive spectrum]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Starcevic|first1=V|last2=Janca|first2=A|title=Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders: still in search of the concept-affirming boundaries.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=January 2011|volume=24|issue=1|pages=55\u201360|pmid=20827198|doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e32833f3b58}}</ref>\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\nOCD is often confused with the separate condition [[obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD).

OCPD, on the other hand, is [[egosyntonic]]\u2014marked by the person's acceptance that the characteristics and behaviours displayed as a result are compatible with their [[self-image]], or are otherwise appropriate, correct or reasonable.\n\nAs a result, people with OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational, are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them.<ref name=\"carter\">Carter, K. \"Obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder.\" PSYC 210 lecture: Oxford College of Emory University.

At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly \"contaminated\" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a \"contaminated\" location, such as a school). That is the \"exposure\". The \"ritual prevention\" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly [[Habituation|habituates]] to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level drops considerably; they can then progress to touching something more \"contaminated\" or not checking the lock at all\u2014again, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.<ref name=\"baojournal.com\">Huppert & Roth: (2003) Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Exposure and Response Prevention.

In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells.\n\nCharacteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref>\n\nILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood. They are particularly abundant at mucosal surfaces, playing a key role in mucosal immunity and [[homeostasis]].\n\nBased on the difference in developmental pathways, phenotype, and signalling molecules produced, in 2013, ILCs were divided into three groups: 1, 2 and 3, however, after further investigation, we now appreciate five distinct subsets within these groups: [[natural killer cell|NK cells]], ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s, and LTi cells.<ref name=\"SpitsArtis2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Spits|first1=Hergen|last2=Artis|first2=David|last3=Colonna|first3=Marco|last4=Diefenbach|first4=Andreas|last5=Di Santo|first5=James P.|last6=Eberl|first6=Gerard|last7=Koyasu|first7=Shigeo|last8=Locksley|first8=Richard M.|last9=McKenzie|first9=Andrew N.

Disturbance of the epithelium lining the hepatic [[bile duct]]s is frequently observed in response to chronic liver inflammation, and increased proliferation of these ducts is associated with liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> Evidence suggests that the enhanced proliferation is triggered by IL-13, which is produced by IL-33 induced production of ILC2 cells. ILC2s have also been shown to enhance the progression of liver fibrosis, in turn promoting the development of liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> \n\nThe availability of specific dietary nutrients can affect ILC immune homeostasis by altering the energy stored in the adipose tissue. Adipose tissue maintains metabolism homeostasis and is now considered a fully immunocompetent organ. [[Malnutrition]] and [[gluttony]] can dysregulate ILC responses via changes in dietary nutrients, having direct effects on the energy stored in the adipose tissue.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> Obesity is associated with changes of gastrointestinal flora, increased afflux of free [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty acids]] from adipose tissue into the liver and increased gut permeability.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> The close anatomical proximity of the gastrointestinal tract and the liver means [[translocation]] of bacterial metabolites through the [[portal vein]] triggers inflammation, acting on innate immune cells, including ILC1s, therefore playing an important role in the activation of an inflammatory state in the liver. Therefore, inflammation associated with obesity can influence the progression of liver disease, due to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> ILC1s as a key regulatory of adipose tissue inflammation, is therefore a potential therapeutic target for treating people with liver disease or [[metabolic syndrome]]. \n\nILC2s have also been identified in human and mouse [[white adipose tissue]], contributing to the development of obesity. Decreased responses of ILC2s in the tissue are a characteristic of obesity, as this interrupts their crucial role in energy homeostasis, resulting in reduced energy expenditure and increased adiposity.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n=== ILCs in skin inflammation ===\n\nThe frequency of ILC2s is higher in the inflamed skin of patients with [[atopic dermatitis]] than in healthy patients.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/> The ILC2s from the skin of the patients had upregulation of the IL-25, IL-33, TSLP and PGD2 receptors, suggesting their role in the activation of ILC2s.

Disturbance of the epithelium lining the hepatic [[bile duct]]s is frequently observed in response to chronic liver inflammation, and increased proliferation of these ducts is associated with liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> Evidence suggests that the enhanced proliferation is triggered by IL-13, which is produced by IL-33 induced production of ILC2 cells. ILC2s have also been shown to enhance the progression of liver fibrosis, in turn promoting the development of liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> \n\nThe availability of specific dietary nutrients can affect ILC immune homeostasis by altering the energy stored in the adipose tissue. Adipose tissue maintains metabolism homeostasis and is now considered a fully immunocompetent organ. [[Malnutrition]] and [[gluttony]] can dysregulate ILC responses via changes in dietary nutrients, having direct effects on the energy stored in the adipose tissue.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> Obesity is associated with changes of gastrointestinal flora, increased afflux of free [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty acids]] from adipose tissue into the liver and increased gut permeability.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> The close anatomical proximity of the gastrointestinal tract and the liver means [[translocation]] of bacterial metabolites through the [[portal vein]] triggers inflammation, acting on innate immune cells, including ILC1s, therefore playing an important role in the activation of an inflammatory state in the liver. Therefore, inflammation associated with obesity can influence the progression of liver disease, due to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> ILC1s as a key regulatory of adipose tissue inflammation, is therefore a potential therapeutic target for treating people with liver disease or [[metabolic syndrome]]. \n\nILC2s have also been identified in human and mouse [[white adipose tissue]], contributing to the development of obesity. Decreased responses of ILC2s in the tissue are a characteristic of obesity, as this interrupts their crucial role in energy homeostasis, resulting in reduced energy expenditure and increased adiposity.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n=== ILCs in skin inflammation ===\n\nThe frequency of ILC2s is higher in the inflamed skin of patients with [[atopic dermatitis]] than in healthy patients.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/> The ILC2s from the skin of the patients had upregulation of the IL-25, IL-33, TSLP and PGD2 receptors, suggesting their role in the activation of ILC2s.
