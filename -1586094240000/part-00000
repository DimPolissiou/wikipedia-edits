The Ogunquit Playhouse is one of the last remaining summer theatres from the Straw Hat Circuit, also referred to as [[Summer stock theatre|Summer Stock]], still producing live musical theatre. The theatre is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref> In 2015, the listing was raised to National Level of Significance \"in consideration of the significant contributions made by its founder Walter J. Hartwig and the Playhouse to Performing Arts Education throughout the nation.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ogunquitplayhouse.org/2015-press/national-register-of-historic-places|title=2015 National Register of Historic Places Listing Raised Press Release|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== About ==\nThe Ogunquit Playhouse produces five or more musicals each season, with each season running mid-May through mid-October with performances Tuesday through Sunday. Each show is cast for its audience, and shows are produced and rehearsed onsite or in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ogunquitplayhouse.org/about/history|title=Playhouse History|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Children's Theatre Program ===\nThe Children's Theatre Program began in the late 1990s, with programs on the Playhouse campus and stage.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Ogunquit Playhouse was established by Walter and Maude Hartwig in 1933 in a renovated garage in the center of Ogunquit, Maine. As part of the [[Little Theatre Movement]] of the 1920s and early 30s, Walter Hartwig organized an annual theatre tournament in New York. When the Depression put an end to the tournament, Hartwig started the Manhattan Theatre Colony and brought it to the town of Ogunquit. In 1937, the theatre moved to a new building at its present-day location on Main Street in Ogunquit, Maine. The Ogunquit Playhouse was the first, and remains the only, summer theatre from the summer stock era built exclusively as a seasonal theatre. After Walter's death in 1941, Maude carried on his legacy at the Playhouse.<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\"/>\n\n=== 1950s ===\nIn 1950, John Lane became the general manager and eventually took ownership of the Playhouse with his business partner, Henry Weller.  Together they focused on modernizing and improving the building and grounds, and through John Lane's direction, audiences enjoyed the brightest stars and finest professional actors performing in Broadway's best shows. After a long and successful career, John Lane retired in 1994. He transferred ownership to the Ogunquit Playhouse Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation that currently oversees the Ogunquit Playhouse. John Lane died in 2000.<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\"/>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn September 1999, Roy M. Rogosin was hired as Producing Artistic Director to help usher the Playhouse towards a new era. During this transition, the playhouse began producing its own shows, designing and building sets, designing costumes and bringing back the stars. The old Manhattan Theatre Colony building was restored as a rehearsal space. At the same time, the Children's Theatre Program began, and continues today. The program provides a number of educational opportunities for children and teens interested in theatre, both as performers and behind-the-scenes.<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\"/>\n\n=== 2000s ===\nIn 2006, Bradford Kenney came on board as the new Executive Artistic Director. With his guidance the Playhouse continued a tradition of excellence, bringing regional premieres and stars of the stage and screen to Ogunquit. With help from grants from the [[Maine Arts Commission]] and the Donato J. Tramuto Foundation, improvements were made to both the sound and lighting systems. Audiences were growing, and soon the theatre expanded from a 10-weeks to a 21-week season. In 2010, a new steel support system for the stage house section of the theatre was installed to support the building and a new rigging system. In 2013, a state-of-the-art sprinkler system was installed.<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\"/>\n\n''75th Diamond Jubilee Anniversary Season''\n\nThe Ogunquit Playhouse celebrated its 75th year in 2007 with seven shows that performed to record-breaking audiences. The season included a revival of 2006's ''[[Menopause The Musical]]'', ''[[The Full Monty (musical)|The Full Monty]]'' with [[Hunter Foster]] and [[Sally Struthers]], ''[[Crazy for You (musical)|Crazy for You]]'' with [[Rue McClanahan]], ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'' with [[Lorenzo Lamas]], ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'', and closed with a revival of ''[[The Full Monty (musical)|The Full Monty]]'' with [[Hunter Foster]] and [[Sally Struthers]].<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\"/>\n\n''80th Anniversary Season''\n\nThe Playhouse celebrated 80 years in theatre with the most successful season to-date that included [[Sally Struthers]] in ''Always, Patsy Cline'' and ''[[9 to 5 (musical)|9 to 5]]'', Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', Carson Kressley in ''[[Damn Yankees (musical)|Damn Yankees]]'' The Boston Red Sox Version, and Ballroom with a Twist featuring celebrity pros and talents from ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', ''[[American Idol]]'' and ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]'', including [[Anna Trebunskaya]] and [[Jonathan Roberts (dancer)|Jonathan Roberts]]. The season closed with what became the theatre's most popular musical ever, [[Buddy - The Buddy Holly Story]] starring Kurt Jenkins. The demand was so high that the show was brought back the following year as the season closer.<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\"/> This feat was achieved again two years later with the Playhouses production of [[Million Dollar Quartet (musical)|Million Dollar Quartet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ogunquitplayhouse.org/2016/million-dollar-quartet|title=Million Dollar Quartet (2016)|website=www.ogunquitplayhouse.org|access-date=2016-08-05}}</ref>\n\n== Shows ==\nShows by season for the last 13 seasons:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> - Brought back by popular demand\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> - Regional premiere of production\n\n<nowiki>***</nowiki>- Play, not a musical\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n|-\n|Beehive, the 60s Musical\n|Menopause The Musical\n\n(Revival)\n|[[Fiddler on the Roof]]\n|[[A Chorus Line]]\n|[[The Drowsy Chaperone]]\n|[[Avenue Q]]\n|Always, Patsy Cline\n|-\n|[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]\n|[[The Full Monty (musical)|The Full Monty]]\n|[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]\n|[[Shout!

The Ogunquit Playhouse is one of the last remaining summer theatres from the Straw Hat Circuit, also referred to as [[Summer stock theatre|Summer Stock]], still producing live musical theatre. The theatre is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref> In 2015, the listing was raised to National Level of Significance \"in consideration of the significant contributions made by its founder Walter J. Hartwig and the Playhouse to Performing Arts Education throughout the nation.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ogunquitplayhouse.org/2015-press/national-register-of-historic-places|title=2015 National Register of Historic Places Listing Raised Press Release|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== About ==\nThe Ogunquit Playhouse produces five or more musicals each season, with each season running mid-May through mid-October with performances Tuesday through Sunday. Each show is cast for its audience, and shows are produced and rehearsed onsite or in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ogunquitplayhouse.org/about/history|title=Playhouse History|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Children's Theatre Program ===\nThe Children's Theatre Program began in the late 1990s, with programs on the Playhouse campus and stage.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Ogunquit Playhouse was established by Walter and Maude Hartwig in 1933 in a renovated garage in the center of Ogunquit, Maine. As part of the [[Little Theatre Movement]] of the 1920s and early 30s, Walter Hartwig organized an annual theatre tournament in New York. When the Depression put an end to the tournament, Hartwig started the Manhattan Theatre Colony and brought it to the town of Ogunquit. In 1937, the theatre moved to a new building at its present-day location on Main Street in Ogunquit, Maine. The Ogunquit Playhouse was the first, and remains the only, summer theatre from the summer stock era built exclusively as a seasonal theatre. After Walter's death in 1941, Maude carried on his legacy at the Playhouse.<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\"/>\n\n=== 1950s ===\nIn 1950, John Lane became the general manager and eventually took ownership of the Playhouse with his business partner, Henry Weller.  Together they focused on modernizing and improving the building and grounds, and through John Lane's direction, audiences enjoyed the brightest stars and finest professional actors performing in Broadway's best shows. After a long and successful career, John Lane retired in 1994. He transferred ownership to the Ogunquit Playhouse Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation that currently oversees the Ogunquit Playhouse. John Lane died in 2000.<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\"/>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn September 1999, Roy M. Rogosin was hired as Producing Artistic Director to help usher the Playhouse towards a new era. During this transition, the playhouse began producing its own shows, designing and building sets, designing costumes and bringing back the stars. The old Manhattan Theatre Colony building was restored as a rehearsal space. At the same time, the Children's Theatre Program began, and continues today. The program provides a number of educational opportunities for children and teens interested in theatre, both as performers and behind-the-scenes.<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\"/>\n\n=== 2000s ===\nIn 2006, Bradford Kenney came on board as the new Executive Artistic Director. With his guidance the Playhouse continued a tradition of excellence, bringing regional premieres and stars of the stage and screen to Ogunquit. With help from grants from the [[Maine Arts Commission]] and the Donato J. Tramuto Foundation, improvements were made to both the sound and lighting systems. Audiences were growing, and soon the theatre expanded from a 10-weeks to a 21-week season. In 2010, a new steel support system for the stage house section of the theatre was installed to support the building and a new rigging system. In 2013, a state-of-the-art sprinkler system was installed.<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\"/>\n\n''75th Diamond Jubilee Anniversary Season''\n\nThe Ogunquit Playhouse celebrated its 75th year in 2007 with seven shows that performed to record-breaking audiences. The season included a revival of 2006's ''[[Menopause The Musical]]'', ''[[The Full Monty (musical)|The Full Monty]]'' with [[Hunter Foster]] and [[Sally Struthers]], ''[[Crazy for You (musical)|Crazy for You]]'' with [[Rue McClanahan]], ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'' with [[Lorenzo Lamas]], ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'', and closed with a revival of ''[[The Full Monty (musical)|The Full Monty]]'' with [[Hunter Foster]] and [[Sally Struthers]].<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\"/>\n\n''80th Anniversary Season''\n\nThe Playhouse celebrated 80 years in theatre with the most successful season to-date that included [[Sally Struthers]] in ''Always, Patsy Cline'' and ''[[9 to 5 (musical)|9 to 5]]'', Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', Carson Kressley in ''[[Damn Yankees (musical)|Damn Yankees]]'' The Boston Red Sox Version, and Ballroom with a Twist featuring celebrity pros and talents from ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', ''[[American Idol]]'' and ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]'', including [[Anna Trebunskaya]] and [[Jonathan Roberts (dancer)|Jonathan Roberts]]. The season closed with what became the theatre's most popular musical ever, [[Buddy - The Buddy Holly Story]] starring Kurt Jenkins. The demand was so high that the show was brought back the following year as the season closer.<ref name=\"ogunquitplayhouse.org\"/> This feat was achieved again two years later with the Playhouses production of [[Million Dollar Quartet (musical)|Million Dollar Quartet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ogunquitplayhouse.org/2016/million-dollar-quartet|title=Million Dollar Quartet (2016)|website=www.ogunquitplayhouse.org|access-date=2016-08-05}}</ref>\n\n== Shows ==\nShows by season for the last 13 seasons:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> - Brought back by popular demand\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> - Regional premiere of production\n\n<nowiki>***</nowiki>- Play, not a musical\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n|-\n|Beehive, the 60s Musical\n|Menopause, the Musical\n\n(Revival)\n|[[Fiddler on the Roof]]\n|[[A Chorus Line]]\n|[[The Drowsy Chaperone]]\n|[[Avenue Q]]\n|Always, Patsy Cline\n|-\n|[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]\n|[[The Full Monty (musical)|The Full Monty]]\n|[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]\n|[[Shout!

Longuet-Higgins was a scientist and mathematician, who discovered and mathematically described many of the theoretical and physical models of ocean waves, currents and natural physical phenomena. He left a legacy of scientific and mathematical publications for the world of [[oceanography]] and mathematics, useful for describing the effects of the oceans on climate, sediment and water transport, structural engineering and natural phenomenon such as [[microseism]]s, [[sonoluminescence]] and underwater sound.\n\nEducated at [[The Pilgrims' School]], [[Winchester]], and [[Winchester College]] from 1937 to 1941 together with [[Freeman Dyson]], his brother [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Christopher]], and [[James Lighthill]] from 1937 to 1943, he won a scholarship in mathematics at the age of 17 to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he qualified after just two years for a BA in mathematics in 1945. He was awarded a PhD in [[geophysics]] in 1951. From 1969 to 1989 he served as a [[Royal Society]] Research Professor at the University of Cambridge.\n\nHis research areas included both [[pure mathematics]] ([[projective geometry]], [[polytopes]], random functions and surfaces) and applied mathematics ([[fluid dynamics]], microseisms, the generation of ocean waves by wind, the dynamics of [[Liquid bubble|bubbles]], [[sonoluminescence]], [[wave breaking]], steep waves, and the exchange of heat and gases at the ocean surface).\n\n==Education and career==\n\nMichael was born in Lenham, Kent in England to Henry Hugh Longuet Longuet-Higgins and Albinia Cecil Bazeley. He had an elder sister Patricia (Pat) and an elder brother Hugh Christopher (Christopher). He was educated at [[The Pilgrims' School]], [[Winchester]], and at [[Winchester College]].  together with [[Freeman Dyson]], his brother Christopher, and [[James Lighthill]] from 1937 to 1943. In 1943, at the age of 17, he won a scholarship in mathematics to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he qualified after just two years for a BA in mathematics in 1945. He was awarded a PhD in [[geophysics]] in 1951.<ref name=NOC>{{cite web|title=Professor Michael S.

He joined Group W (waves) set up on 5 June 1944 under [[George Deacon]]. Here he helped predict wave and current conditions in preparation for the Pacific landings. He worked not only on the theory of [[wind wave]]s but also on the geomagnetic induction of voltages by tidal streams, and on the generation of oceanic microseisms.\n\nIn 1948 he returned to Cambridge, to read for a PhD but without a break in his research, just reporting to [[Sir Harold Jeffreys]] and later to [[Stoneley wave|Robert Stoneley]] at the end of each term. After being awarded his PhD in geophysics (\"just a one hour interview which he almost forgot to attend\") in 1951 at Cambridge, he was awarded a 4-year research Fellowship (Title A) at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. The first year (1951\u201352) he spent in the USA as a Commonwealth Fund Fellow, first at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]] on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and then at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] at La Jolla, California, with [[Walter Munk]]. On his return to England in 1952, he spent two years of his Research Fellowship in Cambridge. Together with [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] and [[J. C. P. Miller]] he was first to publish the full list of uniform polyhedra (1954).\n\nHe was invited to join the [[National Institute of Oceanography (Great Britain)|National Institute of Oceanography]] in [[Wormley, Surrey]] in 1954 (renamed Institute of Oceanographic Science in 1973) then led by [[George Deacon]], studying ocean waves and storm surges. He was elected as a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1963<ref>Sajjadi, Shahrdad G.; Hunt, Julian C. R. (2018). \"Michael Selwyn Longuet-Higgins. 8 December 1925\u201426 February 2016\".

During this period \"of thirteen happy and fruitful years\" he had several visiting research appointments, including the Mathematics Department at [[MIT]] (1957\u201358), the [[University of Adelaide]], Australia (1964) and the [[University of California]], San Diego (1961-2 and 1966-7). Between 1967 and 1969 he was Professor of Applied Mathematics and Oceanography at [[Oregon State University]] in Corvallis, Oregon.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1989 he served as a [[Royal Society]] Research Professor at the [[University of Cambridge]], working both in the [[Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics]] (DAMPT), [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and at The [[National Institute of Oceanography (Great Britain)|National Institute of Oceanography]], [[Wormley, Surrey]].  During this time he was also a Visiting Scientist at [[Caltech]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], Pasadena (1981\u201389) and Adjunct Professor at the [[University of Florida]], Gainesville,(1981\u201387). After his \"retirement\" in Cambridge in 1989 he moved to California and worked at the La Jolla Institute in San Diego. In 1991, he was appointed to the Institute for Nonlinear Science, [[University of California, San Diego]] ([[UCSD]]) as a Senior Research Physicist (known as [[H.M.S. Pinafore|\"The Admiral\"]]), and to the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] with an Adjunct Professorship until his second \"retirement\" in 2001. After that he continued work at Scripps as a Research Physicist Emeritus. He remained active in research, at conferences and served on many committees.\n\n==Honours and Prizes==\n\nMichael Longuet-Higgins received many honours and was awarded several prizes including: \n* Cambridge University\u2019s Rayleigh Prize for Mathematics (1950)\n* Fellow of the Royal Society (1963) \n* Honorary doctorate of the Technical University of Copenhagen (1979) \n* Honorary doctorate of the University of Glasgow (1979) \n* Member of the US National Academy of Science (1979) \n* Fellow of the American Geophysical Union (1981) \n* Sverdrup Gold Medal of the American Meteorological Society (1983) \n* International Coastal Engineering Award of the American Society of Civil Engineers (1984) \n* Oceanography Award of the Society for Underwater Technology (1990) \n* Honorary Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, (2002)\n\n==Personal==\n\nMichael Longuet-Higgins was married to Joan Redmayne Tattersall on 12.

Longuet-Higgins was a scientist and mathematician, who discovered and mathematically described many of the theoretical and physical models of ocean waves, currents and natural physical phenomena. He left a legacy of scientific and mathematical publications for the world of [[oceanography]] and mathematics, useful for describing the effects of the oceans on climate, sediment and water transport, structural engineering and natural phenomenon such as [[microseism]]s, [[sonoluminescence]] and underwater sound.\n\nEducated at [[The Pilgrims' School]], [[Winchester]], and [[Winchester College]] from 1937 to 1941 together with [[Freeman Dyson]], his brother [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Christopher]], and [[James Lighthill]] from 1937 to 1943, he won a scholarship in mathematics at the age of 17 to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he qualified after just two years for a BA in mathematics in 1945. He was awarded a PhD in [[geophysics]] in 1951. From 1969 to 1989 he served as a [[Royal Society]] Research Professor at the University of Cambridge.\n\nHis research areas included both [[pure mathematics]] ([[projective geometry]], [[polytopes]], random functions and surfaces) and applied mathematics ([[fluid dynamics]], microseisms, the generation of ocean waves by wind, the dynamics of [[Liquid bubble|bubbles]], [[sonoluminescence]], [[wave breaking]], steep waves, and the exchange of heat and gases at the ocean surface).\n\n==Education and career==\n\nMichael was born in Lenham, Kent in England to Henry Hugh Longuet Longuet-Higgins and Albinia Cecil Bazeley. He had an elder sister Patricia (Pat) and an elder brother Hugh Christopher (Christopher). He was educated at [[The Pilgrims' School]], [[Winchester]], and at [[Winchester College]].  together with [[Freeman Dyson]], his brother Christopher, and [[James Lighthill]] from 1937 to 1943. In 1943, at the age of 17, he won a scholarship in mathematics to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he qualified after just two years for a BA in mathematics in 1945. He was awarded a PhD in [[geophysics]] in 1951.<ref name=NOC>{{cite web|title=Professor Michael S.

He joined Group W (waves) set up on 5 June 1944 under [[George Deacon]]. Here he helped predict wave and currect conditions in preparation for the Pacific landings. He worked not only on the theory of [[wind wave]]s but also on the geomagnetic induction of voltages by tidal streams, and on the generation of oceanic microseisms.\n\nIn 1948 he returned to Cambridge, to read for a PhD but without a break in his research, just reporting to [[Sir Harold Jeffreys]] and later to [[Stoneley wave|Robert Stoneley]] at the end of each term. After being awarded his PhD in geophysics (\"just a one hour interview which he almost forgot to attend\") in 1951 at Cambridge, he was awarded a 4-year research Fellowship (Title A) at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. The first year (1951\u201352) he spent in the USA as a Commonwealth Fund Fellow, first at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]] on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and then at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] at La Jolla, California, with [[Walter Munk]]. On his return to England in 1952, he spent two years of his Research Fellowship in Cambridge. Together with [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] and [[J. C. P. Miller]] he was first to publish the full list of uniform polyhedra (1954).\n\nHe was invited to join the [[National Institute of Oceanography (Great Britain)|National Institute of Oceanography]] in [[Wormley, Surrey]] in 1954 (renamed Institute of Oceanographic Science in 1973) then led by [[George Deacon]], studying ocean waves and storm surges. He was elected as a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1963<ref>Sajjadi, Shahrdad G.; Hunt, Julian C. R. (2018). \"Michael Selwyn Longuet-Higgins. 8 December 1925\u201426 February 2016\".
