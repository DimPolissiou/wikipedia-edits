{"title_page": "History of the Carolina Panthers", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=December 2017}}\nThe [[Carolina Panthers]]' history formally dates back to 1993, when the NFL awarded the franchise to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. The Panthers, along with the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], began play in the [[1995 NFL season]] as [[expansion franchise|expansion teams]]. They have played in Charlotte since 1996, winning six division titles and two NFC Championships. The Panthers were the first NFL franchise based in the Carolinas and the second professional sports team based in Charlotte, the first being the NBA's [[Charlotte Hornets]]. \n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Origins: 1987\u20131994==\nIn 1987, shortly after it was decided that Charlotte would receive an expansion [[National Basketball Association]] franchise (the Hornets), former [[Baltimore Colts]] wide receiver, North Carolina native and businessman [[Jerry Richardson]] met with a group of potential backers to discuss the possibility of bringing an NFL expansion team to the Carolina region. Richardson Sports decided upon a spot in the uptown section of Charlotte to build a privately financed stadium seating more than 70,000 fans.\n\nRichardson's announcement created a buzz in the region, as politicians, businessmen, and citizens all joined together to show the NFL that a team could be supported in the area. [[United States Senate|United States Senators]] [[Jesse Helms]] of [[North Carolina]] and [[Ernest Hollings]] of [[South Carolina]] put aside their partisan differences to lobby NFL owners to support the expansion. Meanwhile, then-North Carolina Governor [[James G. Martin]] and then-South Carolina Governor [[Carroll A. Campbell, Jr.]] created a committee of citizens from both states to help the cause. Preseason games were held in the region in 1989, 1990, and 1991. The first two were held at [[Carter\u2013Finley Stadium]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], and [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], respectively, while the third game was held at [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. The matchups were between existing NFL teams and all three games were sold out as part of the fans' efforts to show their support.\n\nIn 1992, the NFL released their list of five areas open to a potential NFL team: [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; [[Memphis, Tennessee]]; [[Jacksonville, Florida]]; and the Carolinas, represented by [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. After the vote was delayed because of a dispute between the players and the league, the race began again in 1993. In June of that year, Richardson Sports announced that they would finance the stadium through the sale of [[Permanent Seat Licenses]], club seats, and luxury boxes. In a stunning show of fan support, all seats were sold out by the end of the first day.\n\nThe feasibility of the team was no longer a question, but it was still up to the league to decide where the new team would go. On October 26, 1993, the league announced that the owners had unanimously voted for the Carolinas to receive the 29th franchise, the first new NFL team since 1976 (Jacksonville was named the 30th team a month later). Fans all over the region celebrated with fireworks. In a memorable moment during the expansion announcement conference, Richardson spoke directly into a camera feed going to the Carolinas to thank the 40,000 people who had purchased the PSLs and allowing the stadium to be built without a burden to the taxpayers.<ref>https://www.profootballhof.com/teams/carolina-panthers/team-history/</ref>\n\nEven though St. Louis and Baltimore lost out on their expansion bids, they eventually acquired new teams: the [[Los Angeles Rams]] moved to St. Louis in 1995 (however, the Rams would return to Los Angeles in [[2016 Los Angeles Rams season|2016]]), and as the result of the 1996 [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy]], the [[Baltimore Ravens]] were established by the league as technically a new expansion team. Memphis also temporarily received a team when the [[Houston Oilers]] relocated in 1996 to Tennessee, intending to play the 1997 and 1998 seasons in [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium]] while what is now called [[Nissan Stadium]] in Nashville was being constructed.\n\n==Dom Capers era: 1995\u20131998==\nThe Panthers hired [[Dom Capers]] as their inaugural head coach. Capers was formerly the defensive coordinator for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. \n\n===1995 season===\n{{main article|1995 Carolina Panthers season}}\nDuring the [[1995 NFL Expansion Draft]], [[Rod Smith (defensive back)|Rod Smith]] was the first player selected by the Panthers. During the [[1995 NFL Draft]], the Panthers made their first significant addition (in terms of long-term contributions to the team) by drafting [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] quarterback [[Kerry Collins]]. Upon entering the NFL in [[1995 NFL season|1995]], the Panthers and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] set about building their respective squads with a luxury not afforded to previous expansion teams: [[free agent|free agency]]. The Panthers made excellent use of the tool, picking up wide receiver [[Don Beebe]], linebacker [[Sam Mills]], and placekicker [[John Kasay]]. The Panthers won the annual [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game|Hall of Fame Game]] against the fellow expansion [[1995 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]] 20\u201314 (a game known as the \"Battle of the Big Cats\", due to the similar nicknames of the franchises) on July 29, 1995. General manager [[Bill Polian]], who had built the [[Buffalo Bills]] teams that won four consecutive AFC Championships a few years prior, brought many of the contributors from that squad to Carolina, including [[Carlton Bailey]], [[Frank Reich]], [[Pete Metzelaars]] and Beebe.\n\nThe home games during the season were played at [[Memorial Stadium (Clemson)|Clemson University]], as the Panthers stadium in [[Charlotte]] was still under construction.  This made the Panthers the only sports team in one of the [[Major professional sports league|Big Four leagues]] ever based out of South Carolina, even if only for one year. The Panthers originally wanted to play their first season in [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], which was closer and more accessible to Charlotte, but the [[University of South Carolina]] turned them down.\n\nDespite being drafted first, Kerry Collins was not the team's first starting QB, that distinction instead going to Frank Reich. The Panthers first regular season game was against the [[1995 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] in the [[Georgia Dome]]. The Panthers scored on their first three possessions to take a 13\u20130 lead before the Falcons rallied to win 23\u201320 in overtime. The Panthers first home game (in Clemson) was a 31\u201310 loss to the [[1995 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]]. Reich only played in the first three games but was the first Panthers QB to throw a touchdown pass. Collins assumed starting QB duties in week 4. Following an 0\u20135 start to the season, the Panthers won their first game against the [[1995 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] 26\u201315 on October 15, 1995, after linebacker Sam Mills returned an interception 36 yards for a touchdown. Later that year, the Panthers stunned the league by not only winning four consecutive games (an expansion team record), but defeating the defending [[Super Bowl]] champion [[1995 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] 13\u20137, the first time an expansion team had beaten the reigning champs. The Panthers finished their season 7\u20139, more than doubling the previous record of a first year expansion team.\n\n===1996 season: Playoff Debut===\n{{main article|1996 Carolina Panthers season}}\n[[File:Bank of America Stadium.jpg|thumb|250px|right|After playing their first season at [[Memorial Stadium (Clemson)|Memorial Stadium]], [[Bank of America Stadium]] (formerly known as Ericsson Stadium) has been the Panthers home stadium since September 14, 1996]]\nIn the [[1996 NFL Draft]], the Panthers used their first pick on running back [[Tim Biakabutuka]], and their second pick on wide receiver [[Muhsin Muhammad]], both players would have successful careers with the team. During the off-season, they also picked up quarterback [[Steve Beuerlein]], tight end [[Wesley Walls]], and linebacker [[Kevin Greene (American football)|Kevin Greene]]. After playing their home games in [[Clemson, South Carolina]] during their first season, the Panthers began play at the newly completed [[Bank of America Stadium|Ericsson Stadium]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] starting in September. The team's second year proved even better than the first; following a 5\u20134 start, the players found a groove and rattled off a seven-game winning streak to end the [[1996 NFL season|season]] with a record of 12\u20134. They ended up winning the NFC West division for the first and only time in franchise history.\n\nIn their first ever playoff game, they beat the [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 26\u201317 in the NFC Divisional Playoffs at Ericsson Stadium. The following week, however, they fell to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 30\u201313 in the [[NFC Championship]]. Their fellow second-year expansion team, the [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]], played in the [[AFC Championship]] against the [[1996 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] but lost 20\u20136; the NFL nearly had an all-expansion Super Bowl. Following the successful season, the Panthers were represented at the [[1997 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] by eight players, including [[Kerry Collins]], [[John Kasay]], [[Sam Mills]], and [[Michael Bates (American football)|Michael Bates]] among others. Capers also won NFL Coach of the Year, becoming the first Panthers coach to win the award.<ref>http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14728386/cam-newton-carolina-panthers-nfl-awards-winners</ref>\n\n===1997 season===\n{{main article|1997 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe Panthers picked up several talented players in the [[1997 NFL Draft]], including safety [[Mike Minter]], tight end [[Kris Mangum]], and also signed running back [[Fred Lane (American football)|Fred Lane]] as an [[undrafted free agent]]. Following an impressive second season, the Panthers fully expected to return to the playoffs in [[1997 NFL season|1997]], but a 2\u20134 start quickly began to cloud the minds of Carolina fans. The team finished their third season with a record of 7\u20139, and missed the playoffs. The Panthers lost their first ever appearance on [[Monday Night Football]] by a score of 34\u201321 to the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. They were also shut out for the first time in franchise history in a week 11 loss to the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], 34\u20130.\n\n===1998 season===\n{{main article|1998 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe Panthers started the 1998 season 0\u20137, the franchise's worst start ever. Quarterback Kerry Collins started the first four games for the team before [[Steve Beuerlein]] was given the starting job; he started the season's remaining 12 games. The team got their first win of the year with a 31\u201317 victory over the [[New Orleans Saints]] in week 9, breaking a nine-game losing streak dating back to the previous season. After rallying to win their last two games, the Panthers finished the year 4\u201312, their worst record in franchise history at the time. Kerry Collins, who was dealing with alcoholism, was released following the season. Head coach Dom Capers was also let go after four seasons with the franchise.\n\n==George Seifert era: 1999\u20132001==\nAfter [[Dom Capers]] was let go following the 1998 season, [[George Seifert]] was hired as the second head coach in Panthers history. Seifert had won two Super Bowls as the head coach of the [[San Francisco 49ers]], and had a reputation for winning with talented and experienced teams.\n\n===1999 season===\n{{main article|1999 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe Panthers picked up several players in the [[1999 NFL Draft]], including defensive end [[Mike Rucker]]. In Seifert's first season with the team, the Panthers finished with an 8\u20138 record, a four-game improvement from the previous season, and their first .500 record in franchise history. Following a 2\u20135 start, they finished 6\u20133 in their last 9 games, including a last-second victory over Green Bay where QB Steve Beuerlein ran in for the game-winning score, and a 45\u201313 home victory over the division rival [[New Orleans Saints]] in the final game of the season. However, the team missed out on a wildcard playoff berth through a complicated tiebreaker based on total points scored. The team also had to deal with issues outside of football. Wide receiver [[Rae Carruth]], taken with the Panthers first pick of the [[1997 NFL Draft|1997 Draft]], was arrested in 1999 for conspiring to murder his pregnant girlfriend and was later convicted.\n\n===2000 season===\n{{main article|2000 Carolina Panthers season}}\nIn the [[2000 NFL Draft]], safety [[Deon Grant]] and linebacker [[Lester Towns]] were among the players selected by the Panthers. In Seifert's second season with the team, the Panthers finished 7\u20139, one game worse than the previous season, and missed the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. They finished third in the NFC West, behind the playoff-bound [[St. Louis Rams]] and [[New Orleans Saints]]. Veteran quarterback [[Steve Beuerlein]], who had been the team's starting quarterback since 1998, was released following the season. Tragedy struck the team when former running back [[Fred Lane (American football)|Fred Lane]], who had been a member of the Panthers for three seasons, was shot and killed by his wife during a domestic dispute in 2000 after signing with the [[Indianapolis Colts]].\n\n===2001 season: 15 straight losses===\n{{main article|2001 Carolina Panthers season}}\nSeifert's third and final season with the Panthers was a disaster. After the team released Beuerlein in the off-season Siefert handed the QB reins to [[Jeff Lewis (American football)|Jeff Lewis]], who was released after several poor performances during the preseason. That left the Panthers with rookie [[Chris Weinke]] under center. Weinke had won the [[Heisman Trophy]] and led [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] to a national championship in college but was unable to duplicate that level of success in the NFL. The Panthers won their opening game against the [[2001 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 24\u201313, but then lost 15 straight games. This set a record for single-season losing streaks which held until the [[2008 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]' 0\u201316 campaign of [[2008 NFL season|2008]].<ref>[http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Football/NFL/News/2008/12/15/7753351-sun.html Winless Lions]</ref> The Panthers also finished last in their division for the first time in franchise history.\n\nSeifert was fired the day after the 2001 season ended and the team set out to find its third head coach. Although his final season was the worst in team history, Seifert did help select several outstanding players in the [[2001 NFL Draft]] including linebacker [[Dan Morgan]], defensive tackle [[Kris Jenkins]] and wide receiver [[Steve Smith (Carolina Panthers)|Steve Smith]], each of whom earned Pro Bowl berths and All-Pro awards while playing for the Panthers. Smith, who played thirteen seasons with the team, was considered one of the most electrifying and explosive wide receivers in the game.\n\n==John Fox era: 2002\u20132010==\nAfter Seifert was fired following the disastrous 2001 season, the Panthers hired [[New York Giants]] defensive coordinator [[John Fox (NFL)|John Fox]] as the team's third head coach. Fox was known for defensive discipline and it would be needed to improve a team that had finished in the bottom of the defensive rankings the previous year.\n\n===2002 season===\n{{main article|2002 Carolina Panthers season}}\nFox looked to the [[2002 NFL Draft]] to begin revamping the franchise, starting with the second overall pick; defensive end [[Julius Peppers]]. Peppers was a dominating defensive end at the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|University of North Carolina]] and he was a solid fit for Fox's defensive plan. The Panthers also picked up linebacker [[Will Witherspoon]] and running back [[DeShaun Foster]] in the draft. Peppers combined with fellow defensive end [[Mike Rucker]] and defensive tackles [[Brentson Buckner]] and [[Kris Jenkins]] to form what many football experts at the time called the best defensive line in the game. Meanwhile, safety [[Mike Minter]] anchored the secondary, while Witherspoon (affectionately called \"Spoon\" by fans and teammates) and [[Mark Fields (linebacker)|Mark Fields]] led the linebacker corps. Veteran Rodney Peete led the offense at QB. Fox's defense-first philosophy worked well as the Panthers improved to 7&ndash;9 (a six-game improvement over the previous year) and posted the league's second-best overall defense, including allowing a league-low 3.69 yards per rushing attempt.\n\n===2003 season: The Cardiac Cats===\n{{main article|2003 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe [[2003 NFL season|2003 season]] began with the Panthers drafting several young prospects, including [[Ricky Manning, Jr.]] at cornerback, and [[Jordan Gross]] at offensive tackle. In addition, then-unknown quarterback [[Jake Delhomme]], running back [[Stephen Davis (American football)|Stephen Davis]], and former Rams wide receiver [[Ricky Proehl]] were signed in the off-season, making additions to an offense that needed to complement a top-ranked defense. The team was not without tragedy, however, as it was revealed that former linebacker and coach Sam Mills was diagnosed with [[intestinal cancer]]; additionally, linebacker Mark Fields was diagnosed with [[Hodgkin's Disease]]. The team used their struggle as inspiration, and started the season 5&ndash;0. Delhomme, a former Saints backup, replaced [[Rodney Peete]] at quarterback by halftime of the season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He led the Panthers to a fourth quarter comeback, thus winning the starting job. Delhomme eventually led the team to an 11&ndash;5 record, the NFC South Division title and a playoff berth.\n\nIn the playoffs, they easily defeated the [[2003 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] 29&ndash;10 in a home wild-card game before facing the [[2003 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] in the divisional playoff game in the [[Edward Jones Dome]]. Carolina had an 11-point lead in the last 3 minutes of play, but a touchdown from [[Marshall Faulk]], a successful [[two-point conversion]], and an [[onside kick]] that led to a [[field goal (football)|field goal]] tied the game and sent it to [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]]. Both [[John Kasay]] and [[Jeff Wilkins]] missed potential game-winning kicks in the first overtime, but In the first play of the 2nd OT, however, Jake Delhomme hit Steve Smith with a 69-yard touchdown pass to win the game, 29&ndash;23, sending the Panthers into the NFC Championship game against the [[2003 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]]. The Eagles, led by [[Donovan McNabb]], were in the NFC title match for the 3rd year in a row, but lost it as the Panthers shut down the Eagles offense and, with a 14&ndash;3 victory, headed to their first Super Bowl against the [[2003 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. The multiple close games, won either in overtime or with a slim margin, gave way to a new nickname for the Panthers: the \"[[Cardiac Cats]].\"\n\n====Super Bowl XXXVIII====\n{{main article|Super Bowl XXXVIII}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|Road=Panthers\n|R1=0\n|R2=10\n|R3=0\n|R4=19\n|Home='''Patriots'''\n|H1=0\n|H2=14\n|H3=0\n|H4=18\n|stadium=[[Reliant Stadium]], [[Houston, Texas]]\n|date=February 1, 2004\n|time=6:25 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]/5:25 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|CST]]\n|weather=Played with roof closed, retractable roof stadium\n}}\nAt [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], neither team was able to put up points in the first quarter, and the game remained scoreless until near the end of the first half. However, 24 points were scored in the last 5 minutes of the first half, and the score going into halftime was 14&ndash;10 New England. The third quarter was also scoreless and it wasn't until late in the game that things heated up once again. The teams traded leads numerous times in the highest-scoring fourth quarter in Super Bowl history, including setting a record when Jake Delhomme hit [[Muhsin Muhammad]] for an 85-yard touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter. That pass made the score 22&ndash;21, Carolina and went down in the record books as the longest offensive play in Super Bowl history. After New England responded with a touchdown of their own and a 2-point conversion to make it 29&ndash;22, Carolina would storm right back to tie the game with a touchdown pass to [[Ricky Proehl]] with 1:08 left in regulation, opening the possibility to the first overtime game in Super Bowl history. However, John Kasay's kickoff went out of bounds, giving the Patriots the ball on their own 40-yard line. [[Adam Vinatieri]], who had won [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] two years earlier on a last-second field goal, repeated his heroics, connecting on a 41-yarder with four seconds left, even though he had already missed two field goals in the game. This gave the Patriots their second Super Bowl win in three years.\n\n===2004 season===\n{{main article|2004 Carolina Panthers season}}\nExperts all picked the Panthers to repeat their 2003 season success in [[2004 NFL season|2004]]. Having selected cornerback [[Chris Gamble]] and wide receiver [[Keary Colbert]] with their top two picks in the [[2004 NFL Draft|2004 draft]], and not having lost any core players from their Super Bowl run, the team looked ready for their 10th Anniversary season. In addition, Mark Fields, who had missed the previous season with Hodgkin's disease, returned and was ready to go. But the team suffered major injuries early on, as Steve Smith broke his leg in the season opener against Green Bay, Stephen Davis suffered a knee injury before the second game of the season, and Kris Jenkins had shoulder problems that benched him for the year. In fact, the Panthers had 14 players on injured reserve, including their top ''four'' running backs, more than any other team. This led to a 1&ndash;7 start, and people began wondering if they would repeat the 1&ndash;15 season of 2001. However, backup fullback [[Nick Goings]] stepped up to the challenge with five 100-yd rushing games, Keary Colbert played better than most rookies thrown into the #2 receiver spot, and the defense held together despite the injuries to help the team win 6 of their last 8 games, finishing 7&ndash;9. The Panthers barely missed the playoffs after losing a close game to [[2004 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans]], when a 60-yard field goal attempt fell just short as time expired.\n\nAmong things the Panthers did in 2004 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the franchise was name a [[Carolina Panthers#10-year anniversary team|10th Anniversary All-Time Team]]. With the exception of tight end Wesley Walls, every offensive starter was on the team during their Super Bowl run of 2003. The only defensive players to make the anniversary team that played in the Super Bowl were the front four ([[Julius Peppers|Peppers]], [[Mike Rucker|Rucker]], [[Kris Jenkins|Jenkins]] and [[Brentson Buckner|Buckner]]), linebacker [[Dan Morgan]], and safety [[Mike Minter]]. Pro Bowl punter [[Todd Sauerbrun]] made the squad as well. Naturally, kicker [[John Kasay]] made the team, since he had been the team's kicker since its inception.\n\n===2005 season===\n{{main article|2005 Carolina Panthers season}}\n[[File:Steve Smith 2006-10-15.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Steve Smith (American football, born 1979)|Steve Smith]] lead the NFL in catches, receiving yards, and touchdowns in [[2005 NFL season|2005]].]]\nDespite a home-opening loss to the [[2005 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] to start off the 2005 season, the Panthers got revenge against the two-time defending champion [[2005 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] for the loss in [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], winning the rematch by a final score of 27&ndash;17. Despite going on the road and losing a close game to the [[2005 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] 27&ndash;24, the Panthers managed to get a six-game winning streak going, including a win at home on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' against the [[2005 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]. In a home game against the [[2005 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], [[Steve Smith (American football, born 1979)|Steve Smith]], who had already emerged as one of the league's best wide receivers had a real breakthrough, catching 11 passes for 201 yards and 1 touchdown, with his longest reception of the game being 69 yards. [[Jake Delhomme]] also enjoyed one of his best outings in years, completing 21 of 29 passes for 341 yards and three touchdowns, giving Delhomme a nomination for FedEx Air Player of The Week.\n\nTheir winning streak came to an end however at the hands of the [[2005 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]]. The #1 defense held the Panthers to just three points, as they lost the game 13&ndash;3. After losing to the Cowboys in the season's penultimate game, the Panthers needed a victory to secure a spot in the [[2005\u201306 NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. They responded with a dominating [[New Year's Day]] performance at the [[Georgia Dome]], a 44&ndash;11 victory over the Falcons, making the score the largest margin of victory in franchise history, and the first time since 1997 that the Panthers were able to beat the Falcons in the Georgia Dome. With that victory, the Panthers secured themselves the NFC's #5 seed.\n\nThe Panthers began their post-season play on Sunday January 8, 2006 at [[Giants Stadium]] against the [[2005 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. After both sides failed to score in the first quarter, the trifecta of Jake Delhomme, [[DeShaun Foster]], and Steve Smith showed dominance as they shut out the Giants 23&ndash;0. Carolina's coach, John Fox, used to be the defensive coordinator for the Giants when they went to the Super Bowl earlier in the decade. New York was the nation's number one television market, and the shutout in the playoffs was significant.\n\nTheir next opponent was the Chicago Bears, home to the nation's third largest television market. The Panthers defeated them at [[Soldier Field]] with a final score of 29&ndash;21. With that victory, the Panthers advanced to the [[NFC Championship Game]] for the third time in the franchise's 11-year history. However, during the Chicago game Deshaun Foster suffered a crushing ankle injury that would keep him indefinitely sidelined. Also, star defensive end Julius Peppers re-injured an ailing shoulder. The next weekend they played against the [[2005 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] for the NFC Championship, but injuries and playing on the road for the fourth straight week caught up with the Panthers and they came up short, losing 34&ndash;14.\n\n===2006 season===\n{{main article|2006 Carolina Panthers season}}\nIn the [[2006 NFL Draft]], the Panthers drafted running back Deangelo Williams in the first round. Coming off a playoff season and with new acquisition [[Keyshawn Johnson]], the Panthers sold out [[Bank of America Stadium]] 15 minutes after tickets went on sale.<ref>[http://www.panthers.com Panthers.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> An early injury to Steve Smith led to a two-game losing streak, but his return coincided with a four-game winning run. However, Jake Delhomme was injured soon after and was lost for three games. In the end, the team finished 8&ndash;8 and missed the playoffs. Following the season, offensive coordinator [[Dan Henning]] was fired and Johnson retired, becoming an NFL analyst for [[ESPN]] for several years.\n[[File:Vinny Testaverde.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Vinny Testaverde]] in 2007.]]\n[[File:DeAngelo Williams.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[DeAngelo Williams]] played as the Panthers starting running back from 2007 to 2014.]]\n\n===2007 season===\n{{main article|2007 Carolina Panthers season}}\nAmong the players the team drafted that offseason was WR [[Dwayne Jarrett]], picked in the second round of the [[2007 NFL Draft]]. Jarrett would become a major draft bust. The Panthers began the season as playoff contenders, and won their opener against the [[2007 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] for the first time since 2003. The following week at home against the [[2007 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]], the Panthers jumped ahead 14&ndash;0 but lost 34&ndash;21, unable to fend off a relentless passing attack by the Texans. In week three against the [[2007 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], Delhomme was lost for the season with an injured elbow, which resulted in [[Tommy John surgery]]. After a close loss to the [[2007 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in week 4, the Panthers got back on the winning track behind the passing arm of former [[Houston Texans]] QB [[David Carr (American football)|David Carr]], who drew from the playbook of his 2006 defeat of the [[2006 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] by engineering two 4th-quarter drives; the first for a TD, and the last to set up the game-winning field goal by [[John Kasay]] to defeat the [[2007 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]. Unfortunately for the Panthers, the unpopular Carr suffered the first major injury of his career, badly injuring his back against the Saints. After returning to the game in the second half to get the win, Carr would play sparingly for the rest of the year, forcing the Panthers to rely on a combination of 44-year-old [[Vinny Testaverde]] and rookie [[Matt Moore (American football)|Matt Moore]] for the remainder of the season. The Panthers finished 7\u20139, and missed the playoffs again.\n\n===2008 season===\n{{main article|2008 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe Panthers picked up several talented players in the [[2008 NFL Draft]], including running back [[Jonathan Stewart]], and offensive tackle [[Jeff Otah]]. With the help of a much improved rushing offense, the Panthers rebounded, finishing the season with a 12\u20134 record. This included an 8\u20130 home record. After defeating the [[2008 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] 33\u201331 in the season finale, the Panthers claimed their second [[NFC South]] title and a first round bye in the playoffs. However, on January 10 the Panthers' season came to a disappointing end, as they lost to the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] 33\u201313 at home in the Divisional round. The Panthers' offense was plagued by Delhomme's 6 turnovers (5 interceptions and a fumble) and the Cardinals 27 first-half points.\n\n===2009 season===\n{{main article|2009 Carolina Panthers season}}\nCarolina hoped to make another playoff run in 2009. The 2009 season opener witnessed Carolina lose at the hands of the Eagles (including Delhomme's six turnovers), followed by losses to [[2009 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]] and [[2009 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]]. The Panthers got their first win in week 5 against Washington. In Week 6, they defeated their division rival [[2009 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Buccaneers]] 28\u201321, a game that was most notable for cornerback [[Dante Wesley]] launching himself into the neck of Tampa Bay punt returner [[Clifton Smith (running back)|Clifton Smith]] after Smith had waved for a fair catch. Smith was knocked unconscious and Wesley ejected for his actions after a brief fight broke out between both teams. Wesley was suspended one game and fined $20,000. There followed an uneven string of wins and losses. After 11 games, a recently injured Delhomme was benched, and replaced at starting QB by Matt Moore. With a more aggressive offense in place, the Panthers won four of their last five games, including their last three. These victories included an impressive 26\u20137 sweep of playoff-bound [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]]. They then crushed the [[2009 New York Giants season|Giants]] 41\u20139 in the last game at [[Giants Stadium]], and ended the [[2009 NFL season|season]] at 8\u20138 with a 23\u201310 victory over the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|Saints]].\n\n===2010 season===\n{{main article|2010 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe Panthers lost several key players during the 2010 off-season from previous seasons, including QB Jake Delhomme, defensive end Julius Peppers, wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad, and cornerback Dante Wesley. Their most notable draft pick was [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] quarterback [[Jimmy Clausen]], who eventually started 10 games during the season. Matt Moore started at QB when the Panthers lost in New York in Week 1, and then fell to Tampa Bay. The 0\u20132 team benched Moore and installed Clausen as starting QB. After suffering further defeats against Cincinnati, New Orleans, and Chicago, Carolina entered its bye week at 0\u20135. Moore was brought out as starter again in Week 7 and the Panthers got their first win by defeating San Francisco 23\u201320. Following another seven-game losing streak, in which Moore was eventually placed on injured reserve, Clausen lead the Panthers to their second win, a 19\u201312 victory over the Cardinals. In the end, the Panthers finished the season with a record of 2\u201314 and a last place finish in the NFC South. This marked the team's worst record since 2001 and the worst record in the league that season. However, the team's last-place finish gave them the number one pick in the 2011 NFL Draft.\n\n==Ron Rivera era: 2011\u20132019==\nAfter a disappointing 2010 season, John Fox was fired along with most of his coaching staff 24 hours after the regular season concluded.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/31/sports/la-sp-nfl-report-20110101 \"Carolina Panthers fire Coach John Fox\"], ''LA Times''. December 31, 2010.</ref> A few months later, the Panthers hired [[Ron Rivera]] as the fourth head coach in Panther history. Rivera was previously the defensive coordinator for the [[Chicago Bears]] and the [[San Diego Chargers]] and in 2006 helped the Bears reach [[Super Bowl XLI]].\n\n===2011 season: Cam Newton\u2019s rookie year===\n{{main article|2011 Carolina Panthers season}}\n[[File:CamNewtoncalling A PLAY.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Quarterback [[Cam Newton]] was Rookie of the Year in [[2011 NFL season|2011]].]]\nThe Panthers selected [[Heisman Trophy]] and National Championship-winning quarterback [[Cam Newton]] with the 1st overall pick of the [[2011 NFL Draft]]. This move was controversial, as Newton's ability to play in the NFL was widely doubted by many experts, but it also showed a clear sign that the Panthers were dissatisfied with Jimmy Clausen. Amid all the speculation Cam went on to break [[Peyton Manning]]'s rookie passing yard record, rushing TD's by a quarterback in a single season, and many other records. With leadership from Newton, coach Ron Rivera, and a huge comeback season from Steve Smith, the Panthers would finish the 2011 season 6\u201310 \u2013 a four-game improvement over the previous year \u2013 and finish 3rd in the division.\n\n===2012 season===\n{{main article|2012 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe Panthers drafted [[Boston College]] linebacker Luke Kuechly with the 9th overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft and unveiled an updated logo and word mark. Carolina started the season 2\u20138, losing many of them by late-game collapses. A 19\u201314 loss to the Cowboys resulted in longtime general manager Marty Hurney being fired. However, the team managed to win 5 out of their final 6 games to finish with a record of 7\u20139, good for 2nd in the NFC South. It became their first season with single-digit losses since 2009. The strong finish helped to save head coach Ron Rivera from otherwise losing his job, despite talk of the coach being fired after the season's end.\n[[File:Panthers-Broncos During the 2012 Season.JPG|thumb|Denver Broncos vs. Carolina Panthers during the 2012 Season]]\n\n===2013 season===\n{{main article|2013 Carolina Panthers season}}\nAfter allowing the [[Buffalo Bills]] to score the game-winning touchdown with only 2 seconds left in their week 2 matchup, and then losing 22\u20136 in week 5 against the Cardinals in which Cam Newton threw three interceptions, the Panthers fell 1\u20133 to begin the season. Coach Ron Rivera's job was once again in serious jeopardy, along with questions of Newton's leadership. The team rebounded the following week, beating the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 35-10 and unexpectedly went on a then-franchise record eight-game winning streak. During the streak, the Panthers defeated the reigning NFC champion [[San Francisco 49ers]] in California and defeated longtime AFC powerhouse [[New England Patriots|New England]] on [[Monday Night Football]] in Charlotte. The Panthers defense, led by second year linebacker [[Luke Kuechly]], became the main star during the streak, holding opponents to 20 points or less. It finally ended in week 14, when Carolina was beaten 31-13 by their division rival [[New Orleans Saints]] on [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]. The Panthers were able to finish strong with three victories in a row over the Jets and close wins over the Saints and [[Atlanta Falcons]]. The latter victory allowed Carolina to clinch their third NFC South title overall and the 2nd seed for the NFC playoffs.\n\nIn the Divisional round of the playoffs, the Panthers hosted the 49ers. The reigning conference champions were much healthier than they were in the regular season, and defeated the Panthers 23\u201310. Following the season, Rivera won Coach of the Year, becoming the second Panthers coach to win the award. Kuechly also won Defensive Player of the Year, the first Panther to win the honor.<ref>http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000321591/article/nfl-honors-complete-list-of-winners</ref>\n\n===2014 season===\n{{main article|2014 Carolina Panthers season}}\nAfter a strong start with wins against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and the [[Detroit Lions]], the Panthers suffered a dismal 1-8-1 record over the next 10 games, falling to 3-8-1 with an embarrassing loss against the Vikings, including having two punts blocked. Their record included a 37\u201337 overtime tie against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 6, the first ever tie in both franchise history and NFL history under the current overtime rules.  The tide turned in December, with four consecutive wins against the [[New Orleans Saints]], [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], [[Cleveland Browns]], and [[Atlanta Falcons]]. With these wins, the Panthers finished the season at 7-8-1.\n\nDespite having a losing record, the Panthers captured their second straight NFC South division title and, for the first time in franchise history, playoff berths in back-to-back years. They were also the first team in NFC South history to have back to back division titles and the second team to win a division title with a sub-.500 record, the first team being the 2010 [[2010 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]].  The Panthers defeated the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in the Wild Card round, their first postseason victory in nine years, but lost to the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in the Divisional round.\n\n===2015 season: Super Bowl 50===\n{{main article|2015 Carolina Panthers season|Super Bowl 50}}\nThe Panthers looked to improve on their playoff run from 2014, but things started ominously before the season. Top WR [[Kelvin Benjamin]] was lost for the year after tearing his ACL in a non-contact drill during practice. \nDespite what some thought was a major loss in Benjamin, Carolina went on to shock the NFL by achieving both a franchise-best and league-best 15\u20131 record. This included 14 consecutive victories to start the season, the most by any NFC team in NFL history. The Panthers only regular season loss occurred in the penultimate week of the regular season against the Atlanta Falcons. Season highlights included Cam Newton's flip into the end zone in week 2, defeating Seattle on the road in week 5, an overtime victory over the Colts in week 8, blowing out the Cowboys in the Panthers first Thanksgiving Day game in week 10, winning their third straight division title in week 11, and achieving home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the first time in franchise history in week 17. Also, ten players (six offensive, four defensive) were selected to the Pro Bowl, the most in team history along with eight All-Pro selections.\n\nIn the postseason, the Panthers, having earned home-field advantage, earned a 1st-round bye. At home for the Divisional Round, Carolina faced Seattle in a rematch from the playoffs a year before. After jumping out to a 31-0 halftime lead, the Seahawks stormed back with 24 unanswered points to make it 31\u201324, however the Panthers would recover the ensuing onside kick, ending Seattle's quest for a possible third consecutive Super Bowl appearance. Next, the Panthers hosted the Arizona Cardinals in their first NFC Championship game appearance since 2005 and the first one played in Charlotte. Carolina routed the Cardinals, forcing seven turnovers en route to a 49\u201315 victory, their first NFC Championship win since 2003. With the win, Carolina advanced to [[Super Bowl 50]], the team's first appearance in thirteen years. The Panthers were defeated by the [[Denver Broncos]] in the Super Bowl by a score of 24\u201310.\n\nAt the NFL Honors, which took place the day before the Super Bowl, it was announced Newton had won the NFL MVP award, becoming the first Panther to ever win the honor. The QB also won Offensive Player of the Year (another first), while Rivera won his second Coach of the Year award in three seasons.<ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nfl-hands-out-awards-and-the-carolina-panthers-clean-up/</ref>\n\n===2016 season===\n{{main article|2016 Carolina Panthers season}}\nLooking to defend their NFC South crown for a fourth straight season, the Panthers backfired. Top corner Josh Norman was cut by GM Dave Gettleman in the offseason. Norman then signed with Washington, leading the team to draft three corners to replace him. The Panthers' year started with a close loss to the Broncos in a Super Bowl rematch. A win against the 49ers the following week didn't help, as the team went 1\u20135 over the first six weeks. After a week 13 blowout loss to Seattle, the Panthers rebounded to win two straight. However, they couldn't stop the Falcons who won the NFC South, ending Carolina's three-year run. Newton had statistically the worst season of his career and the team finished with a 6\u201310 record. The season was also marked by the death of former special teams coordinator Bruce DeHaven. Four days after the season ended, team president Danny Morrison resigned. The Panthers also lost defensive coordinator [[Sean McDermott]] who became Buffalo's head coach.<ref>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers/article131753774.html</ref><ref>http://buffalonews.com/2017/01/11/bills-offer-head-coaching-job-mcdermott-hammering-details/</ref>\n\n===2017 season===\n{{main article|2017 Carolina Panthers season}}\n2017 proved to be among the wildest seasons in Panthers history. Newton underwent offseason shoulder surgery and rehabbed for most of the remaining offseason. Longtime Panthers executive Brandon Beane left to become Buffalo's GM. Days before training camp, owner Jerry Richardson suddenly fired Dave Gettleman. The team hired his predecessor, Marty Hurney, as interim GM. The 2017 regular season had ups and downs, including a week 4 win over defending Super Bowl champion New England and trading WR Kelvin Benjamin to the Bills on Halloween.<ref>http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000870452/article/panthers-trade-wideout-kelvin-benjamin-to-bills</ref> \n\nHowever, this all paled to the weekend of December 17th. The Panthers entered the weekend 9-4 overall.\nOn the evening of December 15th, the Panthers announced they were undergoing an internal investigation of Richardson for what was termed \"workplace misconduct\". The NFL announced they were taking over the investigation on Sunday.<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/12/15/panthers-conducting-internal-investigation-into-workplace-conduct-owner-jerry-richardson/957291001/</ref><ref>https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-takes-over-panthers-investigation-into-jerry-richardson-workplace-misconduct/</ref> A few hours later, the Panthers beat the Packers 31\u201324, intercepting Packers QB [[Aaron Rodgers]] three times.<ref>http://www.espn.com/nfl/game?gameId=400951777</ref> [[Sports Illustrated]] then published a lengthy article detailing Richardson's multiple workplace allegations, including sexual harassment and racial allegations.<ref>https://www.si.com/jerry-richardson-carolina-panthers-settlements-workplace-misconduct-sexual-harassment-racial-slur</ref> A couple hours after the Panthers-Packers game ended, Richardson issued a statement announcing he was putting the team up for sale at the end of the season. The statement made no mention of the SI article. <ref>http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Jerry-Richardson-will-put-Carolina-Panthers-up-for-sale/b4b0e583-fe21-4935-9a3a-242005729697</ref> On Monday, December 18, the Panthers announced Richardson was giving up control of the team to Panthers executive Tina Becker.<ref>https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jerry-richardson-gives-up-control-of-panthers-as-ugly-allegations-come-to-light/</ref> \n\nThe Panthers had a chance to win the NFC South in week 17, however, a loss to Atlanta gave the Saints the division title. They finished the regular season 11-5 and made the playoffs. In addition, three Panthers were selected to the All-Pro team (Luke Kuechly, Andrew Norwell, and Daryl Williams). Kuechly, at the time, was the lone Panther voted to the Pro Bowl. In the playoffs, the Panthers season came to an end as they lost to the Saints in the Wild Card round 31\u201326. [[Graham Gano]], Thomas Davis, and Trai Turner (all alternates) later joined Kuechly as Pro Bowl selections.\n\n===2018 season: Under New Ownership===\n{{main article|2018 Carolina Panthers season}}\nAfter Jerry Richardson's shocking announcement on December 17th, 2017, the Panthers entered 2018 up for sale. The team signed Rivera to a contract extension before the 2017 season ended, keeping him under contract until 2020.<ref>http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000903171/article/panthers-sign-rivera-to-twoyear-contract-extension</ref>\n\nEven before the Panthers had a new owner, changes occurred. Days after the season ended, offensive coordinator Mike Shula and quarterbacks coach Ken Dorsey were fired. The team later lost former assistant head coach/defensive coordinator Steve Wilks, who became Arizona's head coach.<ref>http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Panthers-part-ways-with-OC-Mike-Shula-QB-coach-Ken-Dorsey/ac55e975-b353-49d1-9b90-4b629efe87e1</ref><ref>http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/22179970/arizona-cardinals-make-carolina-panthers-dc-steve-wilks-new-coach</ref> [[Chase Blackburn]] was also promoted to special teams coordinator. To fill Wilks', Shula's and Dorsey's positions, respectively, former defensive line coach Eric Washington was promoted to defensive coordinator, veteran coach Norv Turner was hired as offensive coordinator and Norv's son Scott was hired as QB coach.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Eric-Washington-promoted-to-defensive-coordinator/d82966f3-1d83-47ef-996c-c2bb20e39f8c |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224112137/http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Eric-Washington-promoted-to-defensive-coordinator/d82966f3-1d83-47ef-996c-c2bb20e39f8c |archive-date=2018-02-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Panthers-announce-coaching-staff-changes/321cb04c-576e-4838-bbba-d9f838d5efc6</ref> The Panthers later announced Marty Hurney would return as GM.<ref>http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Marty-Hurney-named-general-manager/c9d575f1-2a29-4729-a0eb-902dbb32b9ee</ref> \n\nOn May 22, at the annual NFL owners meeting, the league approved the team's sale to billionaire [[David Tepper]]. Tepper officially became the second owner in team history on July 9.<ref>http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/David-Tepper-approved-to-purchase-Panthers/440cdd34-9602-4bf8-bb50-49bf0bbeb874</ref><ref>https://www.panthers.com/news/sale-of-panthers-to-david-tepper-closes</ref> He later hired Tom Glick as team president.<ref>https://www.panthers.com/news/tom-glick-named-panthers-team-president</ref>\n\nThe 2018 season went through ups and downs for the Panthers. After starting 6\u20132, the team collapsed and lost 7 straight. A week 17 win at New Orleans broke the losing streak and gave them a 7\u20139 record for the season. The team did have 3 Pro Bowlers: MLB Luke Kuechly, G Trai Turner, and DT Kawann Short.\n\n===2019 season===\n{{main article|2019 Carolina Panthers season}}\nDespite the collapse in 2018, the Panthers staff changed little during the offseason compared to the previous year. Perry Fewell was hired as secondary coach. Former Panthers Everette Brown and Ben Jacobs were named assistant defensive line coach and assistant special teams coach, respectively. Longtime running backs coach Jim Skipper also retired. The Panthers also signed several free agents including LB Bruce Irvin, WR Chris Hogan, DT Gerald McCoy, and S Tre Boston who previously played for the Panthers from 2014\u20132016.  <ref>https://www.panthers.com/news/perry-fewell-named-secondary-coach</ref><ref>https://www.panthers.com/news/panthers-announce-coaching-moves</ref><ref>https://www.panthers.com/news/running-backs-coach-jim-skipper-retires</ref>\n\nThe Panthers lost 3 veteran players during the offseason. C Ryan Kalil, LB Thomas Davis, and DE Julius Peppers either retired or, in Davis' case, were released.\n\nThe 2019 season started off poorly. Newton was lost for the year after week 2 due to a foot injury. Backup Kyle Allen rallied the team to win four straight. At 5\u20132, the Panthers derailed, losing their last nine games to finish with a 5\u201311 record. Rivera was fired on December 3rd with Perry Fewell taking over as interim head coach. Running back Christian McCaffrey, however, was a lone bright spot, as he broke several records and became only the third player in NFL history with both 1,000 rushing and receiving yards in a season. McCaffrey joined Kuechly and Trai Turner as the team's Pro Bowl selections.\n\n==Matt Rhule era: 2020-present==\nWith Ron Rivera fired during the 2019 season, the Panthers commenced a coaching search. In January, [[Matt Rhule]] was hired as the Panthers fifth head coach. Rhule previously coached at [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]] and [[Temple Owls football|Temple]], turning both programs into contenders.<ref>https://www.panthers.com/news/carolina-panthers-matt-rhule-agreement-head-coach</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n{{Carolina Panthers}}\n{{NFL team history}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Carolina Panthers}}\n\n[[Category:Carolina Panthers]]\n[[Category:National Football League history by team|Carolina Panthers]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=December 2017}}\nThe [[Carolina Panthers]]' history formally dates back to 1993, when the NFL awarded the franchise to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. The Panthers, along with the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], began play in the [[1995 NFL season]] as [[expansion franchise|expansion teams]]. They have played in Charlotte since 1996, winning six division titles and two NFC Championships. The Panthers were the first NFL franchise based in the Carolinas and the second professional sports team based in Charlotte, the first being the NBA's [[Charlotte Hornets]]. \n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Origins: 1987\u20131994==\nIn 1987, shortly after it was decided that Charlotte would receive an expansion [[National Basketball Association]] franchise (the Hornets), former [[Baltimore Colts]] wide receiver, North Carolina native and businessman [[Jerry Richardson]] met with a group of potential backers to discuss the possibility of bringing an NFL expansion team to the Carolina region. Richardson Sports decided upon a spot in the uptown section of Charlotte to build a privately financed stadium seating more than 70,000 fans.\n\nRichardson's announcement created a buzz in the region, as politicians, businessmen, and citizens all joined together to show the NFL that a team could be supported in the area. [[United States Senate|United States Senators]] [[Jesse Helms]] of [[North Carolina]] and [[Ernest Hollings]] of [[South Carolina]] put aside their partisan differences to lobby NFL owners to support the expansion. Meanwhile, then-North Carolina Governor [[James G. Martin]] and then-South Carolina Governor [[Carroll A. Campbell, Jr.]] created a committee of citizens from both states to help the cause. Preseason games were held in the region in 1989, 1990, and 1991. The first two were held at [[Carter\u2013Finley Stadium]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], and [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], respectively, while the third game was held at [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. The matchups were between existing NFL teams and all three games were sold out as part of the fans' efforts to show their support.\n\nIn 1992, the NFL released their list of five areas open to a potential NFL team: [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; [[Memphis, Tennessee]]; [[Jacksonville, Florida]]; and the Carolinas, represented by [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. After the vote was delayed because of a dispute between the players and the league, the race began again in 1993. In June of that year, Richardson Sports announced that they would finance the stadium through the sale of [[Permanent Seat Licenses]], club seats, and luxury boxes. In a stunning show of fan support, all seats were sold out by the end of the first day.\n\nThe feasibility of the team was no longer a question, but it was still up to the league to decide where the new team would go. On October 26, 1993, the league announced that the owners had unanimously voted for the Carolinas to receive the 29th franchise, the first new NFL team since 1976 (Jacksonville was named the 30th team a month later). Fans all over the region celebrated with fireworks. In a memorable moment during the expansion announcement conference, Richardson spoke directly into a camera feed going to the Carolinas to thank the 40,000 people who had purchased the PSLs and allowing the stadium to be built without a burden to the taxpayers.<ref>https://www.profootballhof.com/teams/carolina-panthers/team-history/</ref>\n\nEven though St. Louis and Baltimore lost out on their expansion bids, they eventually acquired new teams: the [[Los Angeles Rams]] moved to St. Louis in 1995 (however, the Rams would return to Los Angeles in [[2016 Los Angeles Rams season|2016]]), and as the result of the 1996 [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy]], the [[Baltimore Ravens]] were established by the league as technically a new expansion team. Memphis also temporarily received a team when the [[Houston Oilers]] relocated in 1996 to Tennessee, intending to play the 1997 and 1998 seasons in [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium]] while what is now called [[Nissan Stadium]] in Nashville was being constructed.\n\n==Dom Capers era: 1995\u20131998==\nThe Panthers hired [[Dom Capers]] as their inaugural head coach. Capers was formerly the defensive coordinator for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. \n\n===1995 season===\n{{main article|1995 Carolina Panthers season}}\nDuring the [[1995 NFL Expansion Draft]], [[Rod Smith (defensive back)|Rod Smith]] was the first player selected by the Panthers. During the [[1995 NFL Draft]], the Panthers made their first significant addition (in terms of long-term contributions to the team) by drafting [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] quarterback [[Kerry Collins]]. Upon entering the NFL in [[1995 NFL season|1995]], the Panthers and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] set about building their respective squads with a luxury not afforded to previous expansion teams: [[free agent|free agency]]. The Panthers made excellent use of the tool, picking up wide receiver [[Don Beebe]], linebacker [[Sam Mills]], and placekicker [[John Kasay]]. The Panthers won the annual [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game|Hall of Fame Game]] against the fellow expansion [[1995 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]] 20\u201314 (a game known as the \"Battle of the Big Cats\", due to the similar nicknames of the franchises) on July 29, 1995. General manager [[Bill Polian]], who had built the [[Buffalo Bills]] teams that won four consecutive AFC Championships a few years prior, brought many of the contributors from that squad to Carolina, including [[Carlton Bailey]], [[Frank Reich]], [[Pete Metzelaars]] and Beebe.\n\nThe home games during the season were played at [[Memorial Stadium (Clemson)|Clemson University]], as the Panthers stadium in [[Charlotte]] was still under construction.  This made the Panthers the only sports team in one of the [[Major professional sports league|Big Four leagues]] ever based out of South Carolina, even if only for one year. The Panthers originally wanted to play their first season in [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], which was closer and more accessible to Charlotte, but the [[University of South Carolina]] turned them down.\n\nDespite being drafted first, Kerry Collins was not the team's first starting QB, that distinction instead going to Frank Reich. The Panthers first regular season game was against the [[1995 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] in the [[Georgia Dome]]. The Panthers scored on their first three possessions to take a 13\u20130 lead before the Falcons rallied to win 23\u201320 in overtime. The Panthers first home game (in Clemson) was a 31\u201310 loss to the [[1995 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]]. Reich only played in the first three games but was the first Panthers QB to throw a touchdown pass. Collins assumed starting QB duties in week 4. Following an 0\u20135 start to the season, the Panthers won their first game against the [[1995 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] 26\u201315 on October 15, 1995, after linebacker Sam Mills returned an interception 36 yards for a touchdown. Later that year, the Panthers stunned the league by not only winning four consecutive games (an expansion team record), but defeating the defending [[Super Bowl]] champion [[1995 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] 13\u20137, the first time an expansion team had beaten the reigning champs. The Panthers finished their season 7\u20139, more than doubling the previous record of a first year expansion team.\n\n===1996 season: Playoff Debut===\n{{main article|1996 Carolina Panthers season}}\n[[File:Bank of America Stadium.jpg|thumb|250px|right|After playing their first season at [[Memorial Stadium (Clemson)|Memorial Stadium]], [[Bank of America Stadium]] (formerly known as Ericsson Stadium) has been the Panthers home stadium since September 14, 1996]]\nIn the [[1996 NFL Draft]], the Panthers used their first pick on running back [[Tim Biakabutuka]], and their second pick on wide receiver [[Muhsin Muhammad]], both players would have successful careers with the team. During the off-season, they also picked up quarterback [[Steve Beuerlein]], tight end [[Wesley Walls]], and linebacker [[Kevin Greene (American football)|Kevin Greene]]. After playing their home games in [[Clemson, South Carolina]] during their first season, the Panthers began play at the newly completed [[Bank of America Stadium|Ericsson Stadium]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] starting in September. The team's second year proved even better than the first; following a 5\u20134 start, the players found a groove and rattled off a seven-game winning streak to end the [[1996 NFL season|season]] with a record of 12\u20134. They ended up winning the NFC West division for the first and only time in franchise history.\n\nIn their first ever playoff game, they beat the [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 26\u201317 in the NFC Divisional Playoffs at Ericsson Stadium. The following week, however, they fell to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 30\u201313 in the [[NFC Championship]]. Their fellow second-year expansion team, the [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]], played in the [[AFC Championship]] against the [[1996 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] but lost 20\u20136; the NFL nearly had an all-expansion Super Bowl. Following the successful season, the Panthers were represented at the [[1997 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] by eight players, including [[Kerry Collins]], [[John Kasay]], [[Sam Mills]], and [[Michael Bates (American football)|Michael Bates]] among others. Capers also won NFL Coach of the Year, becoming the first Panthers coach to win the award.<ref>http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14728386/cam-newton-carolina-panthers-nfl-awards-winners</ref>\n\n===1997 season===\n{{main article|1997 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe Panthers picked up several talented players in the [[1997 NFL Draft]], including safety [[Mike Minter]], tight end [[Kris Mangum]], and also signed running back [[Fred Lane (American football)|Fred Lane]] as an [[undrafted free agent]]. Following an impressive second season, the Panthers fully expected to return to the playoffs in [[1997 NFL season|1997]], but a 2\u20134 start quickly began to cloud the minds of Carolina fans. The team finished their third season with a record of 7\u20139, and missed the playoffs. The Panthers lost their first ever appearance on [[Monday Night Football]] by a score of 34-21 to the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. They were also shut out for the first time in franchise history in a week 11 loss to the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], 34\u20130.\n\n===1998 season===\n{{main article|1998 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe Panthers started the 1998 season 0\u20137, the franchise's worst start ever. Quarterback Kerry Collins started the first four games for the team before [[Steve Beuerlein]] was given the starting job; he started the season's remaining 12 games. The team got their first win of the year with a 31\u201317 victory over the [[New Orleans Saints]] in week 9, breaking a nine-game losing streak dating back to the previous season. After rallying to win their last two games, the Panthers finished the year 4\u201312, their worst record in franchise history at the time. Kerry Collins, who was dealing with alcoholism, was released following the season. Head coach Dom Capers was also let go after four seasons with the franchise.\n\n==George Seifert era: 1999\u20132001==\nAfter [[Dom Capers]] was let go following the 1998 season, [[George Seifert]] was hired as the second head coach in Panthers history. Seifert had won two Super Bowls as the head coach of the [[San Francisco 49ers]], and had a reputation for winning with talented and experienced teams.\n\n===1999 season===\n{{main article|1999 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe Panthers picked up several players in the [[1999 NFL Draft]], including defensive end [[Mike Rucker]]. In Seifert's first season with the team, the Panthers finished with an 8\u20138 record, a four-game improvement from the previous season, and their first .500 record in franchise history. Following a 2\u20135 start, they finished 6\u20133 in their last 9 games, including a last-second victory over Green Bay where QB Steve Beuerlein ran in for the game-winning score, and a 45\u201313 home victory over the division rival [[New Orleans Saints]] in the final game of the season. However, the team missed out on a wildcard playoff berth through a complicated tiebreaker based on total points scored. The team also had to deal with issues outside of football. Wide receiver [[Rae Carruth]], taken with the Panthers first pick of the [[1997 NFL Draft|1997 Draft]], was arrested in 1999 for conspiring to murder his pregnant girlfriend and was later convicted.\n\n===2000 season===\n{{main article|2000 Carolina Panthers season}}\nIn the [[2000 NFL Draft]], safety [[Deon Grant]] and linebacker [[Lester Towns]] were among the players selected by the Panthers. In Seifert's second season with the team, the Panthers finished 7\u20139, one game worse than the previous season, and missed the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. They finished third in the NFC West, behind the playoff-bound [[St. Louis Rams]] and [[New Orleans Saints]]. Veteran quarterback [[Steve Beuerlein]], who had been the team's starting quarterback since 1998, was released following the season. Tragedy struck the team when former running back [[Fred Lane (American football)|Fred Lane]], who had been a member of the Panthers for three seasons, was shot and killed by his wife during a domestic dispute in 2000 after signing with the [[Indianapolis Colts]].\n\n===2001 season: 15 straight losses===\n{{main article|2001 Carolina Panthers season}}\nSeifert's third and final season with the Panthers was a disaster. After the team released Beuerlein in the off-season Siefert handed the QB reins to [[Jeff Lewis (American football)|Jeff Lewis]], who was released after several poor performances during the preseason. That left the Panthers with rookie [[Chris Weinke]] under center. Weinke had won the [[Heisman Trophy]] and led [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] to a national championship in college but was unable to duplicate that level of success in the NFL. The Panthers won their opening game against the [[2001 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 24\u201313, but then lost 15 straight games. This set a record for single-season losing streaks which held until the [[2008 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]' 0\u201316 campaign of [[2008 NFL season|2008]].<ref>[http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Football/NFL/News/2008/12/15/7753351-sun.html Winless Lions]</ref> The Panthers also finished last in their division for the first time in franchise history.\n\nSeifert was fired the day after the 2001 season ended and the team set out to find its third head coach. Although his final season was the worst in team history, Seifert did help select several outstanding players in the [[2001 NFL Draft]] including linebacker [[Dan Morgan]], defensive tackle [[Kris Jenkins]] and wide receiver [[Steve Smith (Carolina Panthers)|Steve Smith]], each of whom earned Pro Bowl berths and All-Pro awards while playing for the Panthers. Smith, who played thirteen seasons with the team, was considered one of the most electrifying and explosive wide receivers in the game.\n\n==John Fox era: 2002\u20132010==\nAfter Seifert was fired following the disastrous 2001 season, the Panthers hired [[New York Giants]] defensive coordinator [[John Fox (NFL)|John Fox]] as the team's third head coach. Fox was known for defensive discipline and it would be needed to improve a team that had finished in the bottom of the defensive rankings the previous year.\n\n===2002 season===\n{{main article|2002 Carolina Panthers season}}\nFox looked to the [[2002 NFL Draft]] to begin revamping the franchise, starting with the second overall pick; defensive end [[Julius Peppers]]. Peppers was a dominating defensive end at the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|University of North Carolina]] and he was a solid fit for Fox's defensive plan. The Panthers also picked up linebacker [[Will Witherspoon]] and running back [[DeShaun Foster]] in the draft. Peppers combined with fellow defensive end [[Mike Rucker]] and defensive tackles [[Brentson Buckner]] and [[Kris Jenkins]] to form what many football experts at the time called the best defensive line in the game. Meanwhile, safety [[Mike Minter]] anchored the secondary, while Witherspoon (affectionately called \"Spoon\" by fans and teammates) and [[Mark Fields (linebacker)|Mark Fields]] led the linebacker corps. Veteran Rodney Peete led the offense at QB. Fox's defense-first philosophy worked well as the Panthers improved to 7&ndash;9 (a six-game improvement over the previous year) and posted the league's second-best overall defense, including allowing a league-low 3.69 yards per rushing attempt.\n\n===2003 season: The Cardiac Cats===\n{{main article|2003 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe [[2003 NFL season|2003 season]] began with the Panthers drafting several young prospects, including [[Ricky Manning, Jr.]] at cornerback, and [[Jordan Gross]] at offensive tackle. In addition, then-unknown quarterback [[Jake Delhomme]], running back [[Stephen Davis (American football)|Stephen Davis]], and former Rams wide receiver [[Ricky Proehl]] were signed in the off-season, making additions to an offense that needed to complement a top-ranked defense. The team was not without tragedy, however, as it was revealed that former linebacker and coach Sam Mills was diagnosed with [[intestinal cancer]]; additionally, linebacker Mark Fields was diagnosed with [[Hodgkin's Disease]]. The team used their struggle as inspiration, and started the season 5&ndash;0. Delhomme, a former Saints backup, replaced [[Rodney Peete]] at quarterback by halftime of the season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He led the Panthers to a fourth quarter comeback, thus winning the starting job. Delhomme eventually led the team to an 11&ndash;5 record, the NFC South Division title and a playoff berth.\n\nIn the playoffs, they easily defeated the [[2003 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] 29&ndash;10 in a home wild-card game before facing the [[2003 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] in the divisional playoff game in the [[Edward Jones Dome]]. Carolina had an 11-point lead in the last 3 minutes of play, but a touchdown from [[Marshall Faulk]], a successful [[two-point conversion]], and an [[onside kick]] that led to a [[field goal (football)|field goal]] tied the game and sent it to [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]]. Both [[John Kasay]] and [[Jeff Wilkins]] missed potential game-winning kicks in the first overtime, but In the first play of the 2nd OT, however, Jake Delhomme hit Steve Smith with a 69-yard touchdown pass to win the game, 29&ndash;23, sending the Panthers into the NFC Championship game against the [[2003 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]]. The Eagles, led by [[Donovan McNabb]], were in the NFC title match for the 3rd year in a row, but lost it as the Panthers shut down the Eagles offense and, with a 14&ndash;3 victory, headed to their first Super Bowl against the [[2003 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. The multiple close games, won either in overtime or with a slim margin, gave way to a new nickname for the Panthers: the \"[[Cardiac Cats]].\"\n\n====Super Bowl XXXVIII====\n{{main article|Super Bowl XXXVIII}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|Road=Panthers\n|R1=0\n|R2=10\n|R3=0\n|R4=19\n|Home='''Patriots'''\n|H1=0\n|H2=14\n|H3=0\n|H4=18\n|stadium=[[Reliant Stadium]], [[Houston, Texas]]\n|date=February 1, 2004\n|time=6:25 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]/5:25 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|CST]]\n|weather=Played with roof closed, retractable roof stadium\n}}\nAt [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], neither team was able to put up points in the first quarter, and the game remained scoreless until near the end of the first half. However, 24 points were scored in the last 5 minutes of the first half, and the score going into halftime was 14&ndash;10 New England. The third quarter was also scoreless and it wasn't until late in the game that things heated up once again. The teams traded leads numerous times in the highest-scoring fourth quarter in Super Bowl history, including setting a record when Jake Delhomme hit [[Muhsin Muhammad]] for an 85-yard touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter. That pass made the score 22&ndash;21, Carolina and went down in the record books as the longest offensive play in Super Bowl history. After New England responded with a touchdown of their own and a 2-point conversion to make it 29&ndash;22, Carolina would storm right back to tie the game with a touchdown pass to [[Ricky Proehl]] with 1:08 left in regulation, opening the possibility to the first overtime game in Super Bowl history. However, John Kasay's kickoff went out of bounds, giving the Patriots the ball on their own 40-yard line. [[Adam Vinatieri]], who had won [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] two years earlier on a last-second field goal, repeated his heroics, connecting on a 41-yarder with four seconds left, even though he had already missed two field goals in the game. This gave the Patriots their second Super Bowl win in three years.\n\n===2004 season===\n{{main article|2004 Carolina Panthers season}}\nExperts all picked the Panthers to repeat their 2003 season success in [[2004 NFL season|2004]]. Having selected cornerback [[Chris Gamble]] and wide receiver [[Keary Colbert]] with their top two picks in the [[2004 NFL Draft|2004 draft]], and not having lost any core players from their Super Bowl run, the team looked ready for their 10th Anniversary season. In addition, Mark Fields, who had missed the previous season with Hodgkin's disease, returned and was ready to go. But the team suffered major injuries early on, as Steve Smith broke his leg in the season opener against Green Bay, Stephen Davis suffered a knee injury before the second game of the season, and Kris Jenkins had shoulder problems that benched him for the year. In fact, the Panthers had 14 players on injured reserve, including their top ''four'' running backs, more than any other team. This led to a 1&ndash;7 start, and people began wondering if they would repeat the 1&ndash;15 season of 2001. However, backup fullback [[Nick Goings]] stepped up to the challenge with five 100-yd rushing games, Keary Colbert played better than most rookies thrown into the #2 receiver spot, and the defense held together despite the injuries to help the team win 6 of their last 8 games, finishing 7&ndash;9. The Panthers barely missed the playoffs after losing a close game to [[2004 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans]], when a 60-yard field goal attempt fell just short as time expired.\n\nAmong things the Panthers did in 2004 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the franchise was name a [[Carolina Panthers#10-year anniversary team|10th Anniversary All-Time Team]]. With the exception of tight end Wesley Walls, every offensive starter was on the team during their Super Bowl run of 2003. The only defensive players to make the anniversary team that played in the Super Bowl were the front four ([[Julius Peppers|Peppers]], [[Mike Rucker|Rucker]], [[Kris Jenkins|Jenkins]] and [[Brentson Buckner|Buckner]]), linebacker [[Dan Morgan]], and safety [[Mike Minter]]. Pro Bowl punter [[Todd Sauerbrun]] made the squad as well. Naturally, kicker [[John Kasay]] made the team, since he had been the team's kicker since its inception.\n\n===2005 season===\n{{main article|2005 Carolina Panthers season}}\n[[File:Steve Smith 2006-10-15.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Steve Smith (American football, born 1979)|Steve Smith]] lead the NFL in catches, receiving yards, and touchdowns in [[2005 NFL season|2005]].]]\nDespite a home-opening loss to the [[2005 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] to start off the 2005 season, the Panthers got revenge against the two-time defending champion [[2005 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] for the loss in [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], winning the rematch by a final score of 27&ndash;17. Despite going on the road and losing a close game to the [[2005 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] 27&ndash;24, the Panthers managed to get a six-game winning streak going, including a win at home on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' against the [[2005 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]. In a home game against the [[2005 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], [[Steve Smith (American football, born 1979)|Steve Smith]], who had already emerged as one of the league's best wide receivers had a real breakthrough, catching 11 passes for 201 yards and 1 touchdown, with his longest reception of the game being 69 yards. [[Jake Delhomme]] also enjoyed one of his best outings in years, completing 21 of 29 passes for 341 yards and three touchdowns, giving Delhomme a nomination for FedEx Air Player of The Week.\n\nTheir winning streak came to an end however at the hands of the [[2005 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]]. The #1 defense held the Panthers to just three points, as they lost the game 13&ndash;3. After losing to the Cowboys in the season's penultimate game, the Panthers needed a victory to secure a spot in the [[2005\u201306 NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. They responded with a dominating [[New Year's Day]] performance at the [[Georgia Dome]], a 44&ndash;11 victory over the Falcons, making the score the largest margin of victory in franchise history, and the first time since 1997 that the Panthers were able to beat the Falcons in the Georgia Dome. With that victory, the Panthers secured themselves the NFC's #5 seed.\n\nThe Panthers began their post-season play on Sunday January 8, 2006 at [[Giants Stadium]] against the [[2005 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. After both sides failed to score in the first quarter, the trifecta of Jake Delhomme, [[DeShaun Foster]], and Steve Smith showed dominance as they shut out the Giants 23&ndash;0. Carolina's coach, John Fox, used to be the defensive coordinator for the Giants when they went to the Super Bowl earlier in the decade. New York was the nation's number one television market, and the shutout in the playoffs was significant.\n\nTheir next opponent was the Chicago Bears, home to the nation's third largest television market. The Panthers defeated them at [[Soldier Field]] with a final score of 29&ndash;21. With that victory, the Panthers advanced to the [[NFC Championship Game]] for the third time in the franchise's 11-year history. However, during the Chicago game Deshaun Foster suffered a crushing ankle injury that would keep him indefinitely sidelined. Also, star defensive end Julius Peppers re-injured an ailing shoulder. The next weekend they played against the [[2005 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] for the NFC Championship, but injuries and playing on the road for the fourth straight week caught up with the Panthers and they came up short, losing 34&ndash;14.\n\n===2006 season===\n{{main article|2006 Carolina Panthers season}}\nIn the [[2006 NFL Draft]], the Panthers drafted running back Deangelo Williams in the first round. Coming off a playoff season and with new acquisition [[Keyshawn Johnson]], the Panthers sold out [[Bank of America Stadium]] 15 minutes after tickets went on sale.<ref>[http://www.panthers.com Panthers.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> An early injury to Steve Smith led to a two-game losing streak, but his return coincided with a four-game winning run. However, Jake Delhomme was injured soon after and was lost for three games. In the end, the team finished 8&ndash;8 and missed the playoffs. Following the season, offensive coordinator [[Dan Henning]] was fired and Johnson retired, becoming an NFL analyst for [[ESPN]] for several years.\n[[File:Vinny Testaverde.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Vinny Testaverde]] in 2007.]]\n[[File:DeAngelo Williams.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[DeAngelo Williams]] played as the Panthers starting running back from 2007 to 2014.]]\n\n===2007 season===\n{{main article|2007 Carolina Panthers season}}\nAmong the players the team drafted that offseason was WR [[Dwayne Jarrett]], picked in the second round of the [[2007 NFL Draft]]. Jarrett would become a major draft bust. The Panthers began the season as playoff contenders, and won their opener against the [[2007 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] for the first time since 2003. The following week at home against the [[2007 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]], the Panthers jumped ahead 14&ndash;0 but lost 34&ndash;21, unable to fend off a relentless passing attack by the Texans. In week three against the [[2007 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], Delhomme was lost for the season with an injured elbow, which resulted in [[Tommy John surgery]]. After a close loss to the [[2007 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in week 4, the Panthers got back on the winning track behind the passing arm of former [[Houston Texans]] QB [[David Carr (American football)|David Carr]], who drew from the playbook of his 2006 defeat of the [[2006 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] by engineering two 4th-quarter drives; the first for a TD, and the last to set up the game-winning field goal by [[John Kasay]] to defeat the [[2007 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]. Unfortunately for the Panthers, the unpopular Carr suffered the first major injury of his career, badly injuring his back against the Saints. After returning to the game in the second half to get the win, Carr would play sparingly for the rest of the year, forcing the Panthers to rely on a combination of 44-year-old [[Vinny Testaverde]] and rookie [[Matt Moore (American football)|Matt Moore]] for the remainder of the season. The Panthers finished 7\u20139, and missed the playoffs again.\n\n===2008 season===\n{{main article|2008 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe Panthers picked up several talented players in the [[2008 NFL Draft]], including running back [[Jonathan Stewart]], and offensive tackle [[Jeff Otah]]. With the help of a much improved rushing offense, the Panthers rebounded, finishing the season with a 12\u20134 record. This included an 8-0 home record. After defeating the [[2008 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] 33\u201331 in the season finale, the Panthers claimed their second [[NFC South]] title and a first round bye in the playoffs. However, on January 10 the Panthers' season came to a disappointing end, as they lost to the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] 33\u201313 at home in the Divisional round. The Panthers' offense was plagued by Delhomme's 6 turnovers (5 interceptions and a fumble) and the Cardinals 27 first-half points.\n\n===2009 season===\n{{main article|2009 Carolina Panthers season}}\nCarolina hoped to make another playoff run in 2009. The 2009 season opener witnessed Carolina lose at the hands of the Eagles (including Delhomme's six turnovers), followed by losses to [[2009 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]] and [[2009 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]]. The Panthers got their first win in week 5 against Washington. In Week 6, they defeated their division rival [[2009 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Buccaneers]] 28\u201321, a game that was most notable for cornerback [[Dante Wesley]] launching himself into the neck of Tampa Bay punt returner [[Clifton Smith (running back)|Clifton Smith]] after Smith had waved for a fair catch. Smith was knocked unconscious and Wesley ejected for his actions after a brief fight broke out between both teams. Wesley was suspended one game and fined $20,000. There followed an uneven string of wins and losses. After 11 games, a recently injured Delhomme was benched, and replaced at starting QB by Matt Moore. With a more aggressive offense in place, the Panthers won four of their last five games, including their last three. These victories included an impressive 26\u20137 sweep of playoff-bound [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]]. They then crushed the [[2009 New York Giants season|Giants]] 41\u20139 in the last game at [[Giants Stadium]], and ended the [[2009 NFL season|season]] at 8\u20138 with a 23\u201310 victory over the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|Saints]].\n\n===2010 season===\n{{main article|2010 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe Panthers lost several key players during the 2010 off-season from previous seasons, including QB Jake Delhomme, defensive end Julius Peppers, wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad, and cornerback Dante Wesley. Their most notable draft pick was [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] quarterback [[Jimmy Clausen]], who eventually started 10 games during the season. Matt Moore started at QB when the Panthers lost in New York in Week 1, and then fell to Tampa Bay. The 0\u20132 team benched Moore and installed Clausen as starting QB. After suffering further defeats against Cincinnati, New Orleans, and Chicago, Carolina entered its bye week at 0\u20135. Moore was brought out as starter again in Week 7 and the Panthers got their first win by defeating San Francisco 23\u201320. Following another seven-game losing streak, in which Moore was eventually placed on injured reserve, Clausen lead the Panthers to their second win, a 19\u201312 victory over the Cardinals. In the end, the Panthers finished the season with a record of 2\u201314 and a last place finish in the NFC South. This marked the team's worst record since 2001 and the worst record in the league that season. However, the team's last-place finish gave them the number one pick in the 2011 NFL Draft.\n\n==Ron Rivera era: 2011\u20132019==\nAfter a disappointing 2010 season, John Fox was fired along with most of his coaching staff 24 hours after the regular season concluded.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/31/sports/la-sp-nfl-report-20110101 \"Carolina Panthers fire Coach John Fox\"], ''LA Times''. December 31, 2010.</ref> A few months later, the Panthers hired [[Ron Rivera]] as the fourth head coach in Panther history. Rivera was previously the defensive coordinator for the [[Chicago Bears]] and the [[San Diego Chargers]] and in 2006 helped the Bears reach [[Super Bowl XLI]].\n\n===2011 season: Cam Newton\u2019s rookie year===\n{{main article|2011 Carolina Panthers season}}\n[[File:CamNewtoncalling A PLAY.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Quarterback [[Cam Newton]] was Rookie of the Year in [[2011 NFL season|2011]].]]\nThe Panthers selected [[Heisman Trophy]] and National Championship-winning quarterback [[Cam Newton]] with the 1st overall pick of the [[2011 NFL Draft]]. This move was controversial, as Newton's ability to play in the NFL was widely doubted by many experts, but it also showed a clear sign that the Panthers were dissatisfied with Jimmy Clausen. Amid all the speculation Cam went on to break [[Peyton Manning]]'s rookie passing yard record, rushing TD's by a quarterback in a single season, and many other records. With leadership from Newton, coach Ron Rivera, and a huge comeback season from Steve Smith, the Panthers would finish the 2011 season 6\u201310 \u2013 a four-game improvement over the previous year \u2013 and finish 3rd in the division.\n\n===2012 season===\n{{main article|2012 Carolina Panthers season}}\nThe Panthers drafted [[Boston College]] linebacker Luke Kuechly with the 9th overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft and unveiled an updated logo and word mark. Carolina started the season 2-8, losing many of them by late-game collapses. A 19-14 loss to the Cowboys resulted in longtime general manager Marty Hurney being fired. However, the team managed to win 5 out of their final 6 games to finish with a record of 7-9, good for 2nd in the NFC South. It became their first season with single-digit losses since 2009. The strong finish helped to save head coach Ron Rivera from otherwise losing his job, despite talk of the coach being fired after the season's end.\n[[File:Panthers-Broncos During the 2012 Season.JPG|thumb|Denver Broncos vs. Carolina Panthers during the 2012 Season]]\n\n===2013 season===\n{{main article|2013 Carolina Panthers season}}\nAfter allowing the [[Buffalo Bills]] to score the game-winning touchdown with only 2 seconds left in their week 2 matchup, and then losing 22-6 in week 5 against the Cardinals in which Cam Newton threw three interceptions, the Panthers fell 1-3 to begin the season. Coach Ron Rivera's job was once again in serious jeopardy, along with questions of Newton's leadership. The team rebounded the following week, beating the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 35-10 and unexpectedly went on a then-franchise record eight-game winning streak. During the streak, the Panthers defeated the reigning NFC champion [[San Francisco 49ers]] in California and defeated longtime AFC powerhouse [[New England Patriots|New England]] on [[Monday Night Football]] in Charlotte. The Panthers defense, led by second year linebacker [[Luke Kuechly]], became the main star during the streak, holding opponents to 20 points or less. It finally ended in week 14, when Carolina was beaten 31-13 by their division rival [[New Orleans Saints]] on [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]. The Panthers were able to finish strong with three victories in a row over the Jets and close wins over the Saints and [[Atlanta Falcons]]. The latter victory allowed Carolina to clinch their third NFC South title overall and the 2nd seed for the NFC playoffs.\n\nIn the Divisional round of the playoffs, the Panthers hosted the 49ers. The reigning conference champions were much healthier than they were in the regular season, and defeated the Panthers 23-10. Following the season, Rivera won Coach of the Year, becoming the second Panthers coach to win the award. Kuechly also won Defensive Player of the Year, the first Panther to win the honor.<ref>http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000321591/article/nfl-honors-complete-list-of-winners</ref>\n\n===2014 season===\n{{main article|2014 Carolina Panthers season}}\nAfter a strong start with wins against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and the [[Detroit Lions]], the Panthers suffered a dismal 1-8-1 record over the next 10 games, falling to 3-8-1 with an embarrassing loss against the Vikings, including having two punts blocked. Their record included a 37-37 overtime tie against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 6, the first ever tie in both franchise history and NFL history under the current overtime rules.  The tide turned in December, with four consecutive wins against the [[New Orleans Saints]], [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], [[Cleveland Browns]], and [[Atlanta Falcons]]. With these wins, the Panthers finished the season at 7-8-1.\n\nDespite having a losing record, the Panthers captured their second straight NFC South division title and, for the first time in franchise history, playoff berths in back-to-back years. They were also the first team in NFC South history to have back to back division titles and the second team to win a division title with a sub-.500 record, the first team being the 2010 [[2010 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]].  The Panthers defeated the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in the Wild Card round, their first postseason victory in nine years, but lost to the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in the Divisional round.\n\n===2015 season: Super Bowl 50===\n{{main article|2015 Carolina Panthers season|Super Bowl 50}}\nThe Panthers looked to improve on their playoff run from 2014, but things started ominously before the season. Top WR [[Kelvin Benjamin]] was lost for the year after tearing his ACL in a non-contact drill during practice. \nDespite what some thought was a major loss in Benjamin, Carolina went on to shock the NFL by achieving both a franchise-best and league-best 15-1 record. This included 14 consecutive victories to start the season, the most by any NFC team in NFL history. The Panthers only regular season loss occurred in the penultimate week of the regular season against the Atlanta Falcons. Season highlights included Cam Newton's flip into the end zone in week 2, defeating Seattle on the road in week 5, an overtime victory over the Colts in week 8, blowing out the Cowboys in the Panthers first Thanksgiving Day game in week 10, winning their third straight division title in week 11, and achieving home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the first time in franchise history in week 17. Also, ten players (six offensive, four defensive) were selected to the Pro Bowl, the most in team history along with eight All-Pro selections.\n\nIn the postseason, the Panthers, having earned home-field advantage, earned a 1st-round bye. At home for the Divisional Round, Carolina faced Seattle in a rematch from the playoffs a year before. After jumping out to a 31-0 halftime lead, the Seahawks stormed back with 24 unanswered points to make it 31-24, however the Panthers would recover the ensuing onside kick, ending Seattle's quest for a possible third consecutive Super Bowl appearance. Next, the Panthers hosted the Arizona Cardinals in their first NFC Championship game appearance since 2005 and the first one played in Charlotte. Carolina routed the Cardinals, forcing seven turnovers en route to a 49-15 victory, their first NFC Championship win since 2003. With the win, Carolina advanced to [[Super Bowl 50]], the team's first appearance in thirteen years. The Panthers were defeated by the [[Denver Broncos]] in the Super Bowl by a score of 24\u201310.\n\nAt the NFL Honors, which took place the day before the Super Bowl, it was announced Newton had won the NFL MVP award, becoming the first Panther to ever win the honor. The QB also won Offensive Player of the Year (another first), while Rivera won his second Coach of the Year award in three seasons.<ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nfl-hands-out-awards-and-the-carolina-panthers-clean-up/</ref>\n\n===2016 season===\n{{main article|2016 Carolina Panthers season}}\nLooking to defend their NFC South crown for a fourth straight season, the Panthers backfired. Top corner Josh Norman was cut by GM Dave Gettleman in the offseason. Norman then signed with Washington, leading the team to draft three corners to replace him. The Panthers' year started with a close loss to the Broncos in a Super Bowl rematch. A win against the 49ers the following week didn't help, as the team went 1-5 over the first six weeks. After a week 13 blowout loss to Seattle, the Panthers rebounded to win two straight. However, they couldn't stop the Falcons who won the NFC South, ending Carolina's three-year run. Newton had statistically the worst season of his career and the team finished with a 6-10 record. The season was also marked by the death of former special teams coordinator Bruce DeHaven. Four days after the season ended, team president Danny Morrison resigned. The Panthers also lost defensive coordinator [[Sean McDermott]] who became Buffalo's head coach.<ref>http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers/article131753774.html</ref><ref>http://buffalonews.com/2017/01/11/bills-offer-head-coaching-job-mcdermott-hammering-details/</ref>\n\n===2017 season===\n{{main article|2017 Carolina Panthers season}}\n2017 proved to be among the wildest seasons in Panthers history. Newton underwent offseason shoulder surgery and rehabbed for most of the remaining offseason. Longtime Panthers executive Brandon Beane left to become Buffalo's GM. Days before training camp, owner Jerry Richardson suddenly fired Dave Gettleman. The team hired his predecessor, Marty Hurney, as interim GM. The 2017 regular season had ups and downs, including a week 4 win over defending Super Bowl champion New England and trading WR Kelvin Benjamin to the Bills on Halloween.<ref>http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000870452/article/panthers-trade-wideout-kelvin-benjamin-to-bills</ref> \n\nHowever, this all paled to the weekend of December 17th. The Panthers entered the weekend 9-4 overall.\nOn the evening of December 15th, the Panthers announced they were undergoing an internal investigation of Richardson for what was termed \"workplace misconduct\". The NFL announced they were taking over the investigation on Sunday.<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/12/15/panthers-conducting-internal-investigation-into-workplace-conduct-owner-jerry-richardson/957291001/</ref><ref>https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-takes-over-panthers-investigation-into-jerry-richardson-workplace-misconduct/</ref> A few hours later, the Panthers beat the Packers 31-24, intercepting Packers QB [[Aaron Rodgers]] three times.<ref>http://www.espn.com/nfl/game?gameId=400951777</ref> [[Sports Illustrated]] then published a lengthy article detailing Richardson's multiple workplace allegations, including sexual harassment and racial allegations.<ref>https://www.si.com/jerry-richardson-carolina-panthers-settlements-workplace-misconduct-sexual-harassment-racial-slur</ref> A couple hours after the Panthers-Packers game ended, Richardson issued a statement announcing he was putting the team up for sale at the end of the season. The statement made no mention of the SI article. <ref>http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Jerry-Richardson-will-put-Carolina-Panthers-up-for-sale/b4b0e583-fe21-4935-9a3a-242005729697</ref> On Monday, December 18, the Panthers announced Richardson was giving up control of the team to Panthers executive Tina Becker.<ref>https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jerry-richardson-gives-up-control-of-panthers-as-ugly-allegations-come-to-light/</ref> \n\nThe Panthers had a chance to win the NFC South in week 17, however, a loss to Atlanta gave the Saints the division title. They finished the regular season 11-5 and made the playoffs. In addition, three Panthers were selected to the All-Pro team (Luke Kuechly, Andrew Norwell, and Daryl Williams). Kuechly, at the time, was the lone Panther voted to the Pro Bowl. In the playoffs, the Panthers season came to an end as they lost to the Saints in the Wild Card round 31-26. [[Graham Gano]], Thomas Davis, and Trai Turner (all alternates) later joined Kuechly as Pro Bowl selections.\n\n===2018 season: Under New Ownership===\n{{main article|2018 Carolina Panthers season}}\nAfter Jerry Richardson's shocking announcement on December 17th, 2017, the Panthers entered 2018 up for sale. The team signed Rivera to a contract extension before the 2017 season ended, keeping him under contract until 2020.<ref>http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000903171/article/panthers-sign-rivera-to-twoyear-contract-extension</ref>\n\nEven before the Panthers had a new owner, changes occurred. Days after the season ended, offensive coordinator Mike Shula and quarterbacks coach Ken Dorsey were fired. The team later lost former assistant head coach/defensive coordinator Steve Wilks, who became Arizona's head coach.<ref>http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Panthers-part-ways-with-OC-Mike-Shula-QB-coach-Ken-Dorsey/ac55e975-b353-49d1-9b90-4b629efe87e1</ref><ref>http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/22179970/arizona-cardinals-make-carolina-panthers-dc-steve-wilks-new-coach</ref> [[Chase Blackburn]] was also promoted to special teams coordinator. To fill Wilks', Shula's and Dorsey's positions, respectively, former defensive line coach Eric Washington was promoted to defensive coordinator, veteran coach Norv Turner was hired as offensive coordinator and Norv's son Scott was hired as QB coach.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Eric-Washington-promoted-to-defensive-coordinator/d82966f3-1d83-47ef-996c-c2bb20e39f8c |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224112137/http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Eric-Washington-promoted-to-defensive-coordinator/d82966f3-1d83-47ef-996c-c2bb20e39f8c |archive-date=2018-02-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Panthers-announce-coaching-staff-changes/321cb04c-576e-4838-bbba-d9f838d5efc6</ref> The Panthers later announced Marty Hurney would return as GM.<ref>http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Marty-Hurney-named-general-manager/c9d575f1-2a29-4729-a0eb-902dbb32b9ee</ref> \n\nOn May 22, at the annual NFL owners meeting, the league approved the team's sale to billionaire [[David Tepper]]. Tepper officially became the second owner in team history on July 9.<ref>http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/David-Tepper-approved-to-purchase-Panthers/440cdd34-9602-4bf8-bb50-49bf0bbeb874</ref><ref>https://www.panthers.com/news/sale-of-panthers-to-david-tepper-closes</ref> He later hired Tom Glick as team president.<ref>https://www.panthers.com/news/tom-glick-named-panthers-team-president</ref>\n\nThe 2018 season went through ups and downs for the Panthers. After starting 6-2, the team collapsed and lost 7 straight. A week 17 win at New Orleans broke the losing streak and gave them a 7-9 record for the season. The team did have 3 Pro Bowlers: MLB Luke Kuechly, G Trai Turner, and DT Kawann Short.\n\n===2019 season===\n{{main article|2019 Carolina Panthers season}}\nDespite the collapse in 2018, the Panthers staff changed little during the offseason compared to the previous year. Perry Fewell was hired as secondary coach. Former Panthers Everette Brown and Ben Jacobs were named assistant defensive line coach and assistant special teams coach, respectively. Longtime running backs coach Jim Skipper also retired. The Panthers also signed several free agents including LB Bruce Irvin, WR Chris Hogan, DT Gerald McCoy, and S Tre Boston who previously played for the Panthers from 2014-2016.  <ref>https://www.panthers.com/news/perry-fewell-named-secondary-coach</ref><ref>https://www.panthers.com/news/panthers-announce-coaching-moves</ref><ref>https://www.panthers.com/news/running-backs-coach-jim-skipper-retires</ref>\n\nThe Panthers lost 3 veteran players during the offseason. C Ryan Kalil, LB Thomas Davis, and DE Julius Peppers either retired or, in Davis' case, were released.\n\nThe 2019 season started off poorly. Newton was lost for the year after week 2 due to a foot injury. Backup Kyle Allen rallied the team to win four straight. At 5-2, the Panthers derailed, losing their last nine games to finish with a 5-11 record. Rivera was fired on December 3rd with Perry Fewell taking over as interim head coach. Running back Christian McCaffrey, however, was a lone bright spot, as he broke several records and became only the third player in NFL history with both 1,000 rushing and receiving yards in a season. McCaffrey joined Kuechly and Trai Turner as the team's Pro Bowl selections.\n\n==Matt Rhule era: 2020-present==\nWith Ron Rivera fired during the 2019 season, the Panthers commenced a coaching search. In January, [[Matt Rhule]] was hired as the Panthers fifth head coach. Rhule previously coached at [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]] and [[Temple Owls football|Temple]], turning both programs into contenders.<ref>https://www.panthers.com/news/carolina-panthers-matt-rhule-agreement-head-coach</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n{{Carolina Panthers}}\n{{NFL team history}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Carolina Panthers}}\n\n[[Category:Carolina Panthers]]\n[[Category:National Football League history by team|Carolina Panthers]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 34-21 \u2192 34\u201321 (12), 2-8 \u2192 2\u20138 (9)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Carolina_Panthers"}

Improbabile che facessero parte di una [[predella]] (troppe scene e di formato poco consono), si pensa che potessero essere raggruppate a formare una sorta di polittico a storie piccole, simile per struttura alla [[Tomba Tarlati]] nel [[Duomo di Arezzo]] o alle [[Formelle dell'armadio della sacrestia di Santa Croce]] di [[Taddeo Gaddi]], quindi con parti mobili<ref>AA.VV., ''Alte Pinakothek Munich'', cit., p. 226.</ref>.\n\nL'unica menzione compatibile con una tale struttura \u00e8 quella del [[Vasari]] (1568) che ricord\u00f2 \"una tavola di man di Giotto di figure piccole\" gi\u00e0 a [[Sansepolcro]], trasferita ad [[Arezzo]] da Pietro Tarlati, fratello del vescovo sepolto in Duomo e verosimilmente proprio per decorarne la tomba\", a met\u00e0 del Trecento.

However, when the medreses were no longer able to meet the needs of the modern world, a restructuring process began, and as a result, the institutions of higher education called ''Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn'', the core of Istanbul University, was established.\n\nAn institution of [[higher education]] named the ''Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn-u Osman\u00ee'' (\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a) (Ottoman House of Sciences) was created in 1863, but suppressed in 1871.<ref name=\"R\u00fcegg, Walter 687\"/> Its first rector was [[Hasan Tahsini]], regarded as one of the most important Ottoman scholars of the 19th century.

Starting from 1874, some classes of Literature, Law and Applied Sciences were given at the building of [[Galatasaray High School]], which continued regularly until 1881. On 1 September 1900, the school was renamed and reorganized as the ''Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn-u \u015eah\u00e2ne'' (Imperial House of Multiple Sciences) with courses on Mathematics, Literature and Theology. On 20 April 1912, the school was renamed as the ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' (Istanbul House of Multiple Sciences) while the number of courses were increased and the curricula were modernized with the establishment of the Schools of Medicine, Law, Applied Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics), Literature and Theology.\n\nOn 21 April 1924, the [[Republic of Turkey]] recognized the ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' as a state school, and on 7 October 1925, the administrative autonomy of ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' was recognized while the ''Schools'' (within the old Medrese system) became modern ''Faculties''.\n\nOn 1 August 1933, ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' was reorganized as ''\u0130stanbul \u00dcniversitesi'' (Istanbul University) following the [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms|educational reforms]] of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]].

In 1943, Japan required Hong Kong to use [[Japanese military yen]] to exchange inter-medium. In 1945, the Japanese announced surrender in the Second World War, and the [[Japanese military yen]] became useless paper. Most people go to a pawnbroker and have some Hong Kong Dollars for their daily life. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With government support, The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was set up in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members and combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on [[Hong Kong Island]], particularly [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Kowloon]]. Because many jewelers and goldsmiths shop are located in Central, the mortgage and loan amount is usually higher.<ref>\u65bc\u5f65\u5317. \u9999\u6e2f\u7576\u92ea\u4f55\u4ee5\u7d93\u4e45\u4e0d\u8870\uff1a\"\u62bc\"\u5b57\u62db\u724c\u540e\u6709\u4e7e\u5764 {{cite web |url=http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116213249/http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Extracted on 3/4 November 2013</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=for entire paragraph|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn order to prevent the sale of stolen property in pawn shops, Hong Kong law stipulates that pawn shops must check the IDs of would-be clients looking to pawn items, which are under strict verification and registration.

The screen is tall enough to block passersby from seeing inside. Clients can be concealed by the board to avoid embarrassment.\n\n==== Pawning counter ====\nThe counter of the pawn shop, which is behind the tall board, is typically higher than the average person. There are window frames in the counter. Clients need to give their mortgaged properties upward to the pawning counter. This design shows the higher status of the pawnbrokers. Prices seem to be lower due to the psychological effect caused by this design{{Citation needed|reason=Need a source for psychological effect|date=January 2018}}. Another reason for setting a high counter is for security.

In 1943, Japan required Hong Kong to use [[Japanese military yen]] to exchange inter-medium. In 1945, the Japanese announced surrender in the Second World War, and the [[Japanese military yen]] became useless paper. Most people go to a pawnbroker and have some Hong Kong Dollars for their daily life. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With government support, The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was set up in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members and combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on [[Hong Kong Island]], particularly [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Kowloon]]. Because many jewelers and goldsmiths shop are located in Central, the mortgage and loan amount is usually higher.<ref>\u65bc\u5f65\u5317. \u9999\u6e2f\u7576\u92ea\u4f55\u4ee5\u7d93\u4e45\u4e0d\u8870\uff1a\"\u62bc\"\u5b57\u62db\u724c\u540e\u6709\u4e7e\u5764 {{cite web |url=http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116213249/http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Extracted on 3/4 November 2013</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=for entire paragraph|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn order to prevent the sale of stolen property in pawn shops, Hong Kong law stipulates that pawn shops must check the IDs of would-be clients looking to pawn items, which are under strict verification and registration.

{"title_page": "History of the Canberra Raiders", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=December 2016}}\nThe '''History of the [[Canberra Raiders]]''' Rugby League Football Club began with their establishment in 1982. Along with the [[Illawarra Steelers]], they became the first clubs from outside the [[Sydney]] area in over half a century to compete in the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership]]. The Raiders have competed in every season of top-level rugby league in Australia since then and have won a total of three premierships: 1989, 1990 and 1994.\n\n==Establishment==\nIn 1981, the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]] (NSWRFL) decided to expand the number of teams in its [[Sydney]]-based [[NSWRFL premiership|premiership]] for the first time since the 1960s. This time it would venture further out into the state of [[New South Wales]] by introducing two teams from outside Sydney. The Canberra franchise was accepted as the 14th team to compete in the NSWRFL premiership for the [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982 season]], beating bids from Campbelltown, Newcastle and the Central Coast.  They were admitted along with the [[Illawarra Steelers]], of Wollongong. Thus the Canberra club, being in the [[Australian Capital Territory]], was the first team ever from an Australian state other than New South Wales to compete in the premiership.\n\nThe initially unnamed team decided to adopt the name \"Raiders\", which was coined by the media in reference to the team being the first based outside Sydney since the old [[Newcastle Rebels|Newcastle]] team left the League in 1909.\n\n==1982-86==\nThe club's first coach was former Australian international player and Easts coach, [[Don Furner]] who was coaching in the nearby town of [[Queanbeyan]] at the time. Their inaugural captain was Balmain forward, [[David Grant (rugby league)|David Grant]]. Canberra's initial seasons were a mixed bag and they became notorious for late game collapses, leading to the nickname \"Canberra Faders\". In fact, no team had conceded more tries in a season than the 1982 Raiders. The club's first win, a 12-11 heartstopper v [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], came in its 8th match, and 3 more wins followed, most notably against then competition leaders [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|Souths]]. The team earned the [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]] in their debut year, although this would be the last time they did so.\n\n1983 saw a new captain, Newtown and former Kangaroos back, [[Allan McMahon]], and nine wins, more than doubling 1982's four. However, the team continued to struggle to win away from home. [[Ron Giteau]] was handed the captaincy in 1984 and an away win first up that year foreshadowed a much improved season, a positive winning record (13-11) snagging a playoff for fifth versus Souths. But this game was lost (4-23), and the Raiders had still not succeeded in reaching the semi-finals of the competition.\n\n1985 saw [[Dean Lance]] named captain of the club which had a regression, with the team winning only 8 games (though the reserves did reach the Grand Final). Though 1986 was similarly disappointing, the team had a core group of players, such as [[Mal Meninga]], [[Gary Belcher]], [[Steve Walters]], and [[John Ferguson (rugby league)|John Ferguson]] who would greatly influence the coming decade. Belcher became the first Raiders player to be selected to make his d\u00e9but for the Australian national side in 1986.\n\n== 1987-1995 ==\nThis was the most successful period in the Raiders' short history, with 5 Grand Finals and 3 premierships. In 1987, Souths' Brisbane Rugby League premiership-winning coach and incumbent Queensland State of Origin coach, [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]] became Don Furner's co-coach at Canberra. [[Laurie Daley]], [[Peter Jackson (rugby league)|Peter Jackson]] and [[Glenn Lazarus]] also debuted this year. The team finished third, resulting in a maiden semi-finals appearance. Despite losing their first finals match against Easts, the Raiders rallied to defeat Souths (46-12) and Easts again (32-24). The latter earned the team a place in the Grand Final, but they were never really competitive against minor premiers Manly, going down 8-18.\n\n1988 saw the departure of the Furner-Bennett coaching partnership and a new coach in Penrith's [[Tim Sheens]]. Notable players starting out in 1988 were [[Bradley Clyde]] and [[Ricky Stuart]]. The 1988 season featured free-scoring (over 100 tries in 22 games) and a number of large victories, with the team again finishing in third place on the ladder. Unfortunately, a narrow loss against [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury]] in the Major Semi-Final was followed by defeat against [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] and an early exit.\n\n[[Mal Meninga]] became captain of the club in 1989. With 5 rounds to play in the '89 season, Canberra were 7th and in danger of missing the semis. But a hard-fought 14\u201310 win over Easts started a 9-match winning streak, culminating in the club's first Premiership. In one of the all-time great Grand Finals, the Raiders sent the game into extra time after a late [[John Ferguson (rugby league)|John Ferguson]] try that was converted by Meninga. [[Steve Jackson (rugby league)|Steve Jackson]] scored the winning try to win the premiership for the Raiders. This memorable match is now commemorated each year with the [[1989 League Legends Cup]]. On 4 October, Canberra played British champions [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] in the [[1989 World Club Challenge]] at [[Old Trafford]], Manchester. The Raiders lost 18 to 30 in front of 30,768.\n\n1990 was a stellar year for the club at all levels. All three grades making the Grand Final, with only the reserves losing. The first grade side earned their first Minor Premiership and a second consecutive title, defeating [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] in the decider.\n\nTrouble brewed in 1991 as the club was embroiled in [[salary cap]] hardships. On 3 April, [[NSWRL]] general manager [[John Quayle (rugby league)|John Quayle]] revealed that Canberra were in breach of their salary cap when they won the previous year's premiership.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last =AAP\n  | first = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Melbourne Storm salary cap quotes\n  | work = The Roar\n  | place =Australia\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | publisher = The Roar Sports Opinion\n  | date = 2010-04-22\n  | url = http://www.theroar.com.au/2010/04/22/melbourne-storm-salary-cap-quotes/\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-22}}</ref> Nonetheless, a fourth Grand Final berth was secured - the team's third in a row. However, the team went down to Penrith in a repeat of the 1990 Grand Final. [[Jason Croker]], who would go on to become the team's longest serving player, debuted this year. The fallout from the salary cap imbroglio saw several players leave the club, most prominently [[Glenn Lazarus]], [[Brent Todd]], [[David Barnhill]], [[Nigel Gaffey]] and [[Paul Martin]]. An average performance resulted, with the Raiders missing the finals for the first time since 1986.\n\n[[David Furner]], son of the Raiders' inaugural coach [[Don Furner]], started out in 1992. The club finished 12th and failed to reach the finals. 1993 was a marked improvement, with the Raiders sitting in first place on the ladder with 2 rounds remaining when tragedy struck during their record breaking 68 - 0 victory over Parramatta at Bruce Stadium.  Ricky Stuart suffered a bad leg break and the team went on to lose its next three games against Brisbane, St George and Canterbury.  Having beaten all three of these teams recently in the season the Raiders were well placed to secure another Grand Final berth before the injury occurred.\n\n1994 was the last season of the Raiders' and Australia's test captain, Mal Meninga. Canberra finished the regular season in 3rd place and successfully played their way to the grand final once again. Meninga went out in style, scoring the final try of the match as the Raiders scored their 3rd premiership in six seasons.\n\nWith the retirement of Meninga, Ricky Stuart was named as captain of the club in 1995. That season they finished second, but lost in the preliminary finals.\n\n==1996-2006==\nSince their final premiership in 1994, the Raiders have been unable to scale their previous heights, largely due to their inability to lure representative players to the capital. The team bowed out in Round 1 of the 1996 finals series, losing to St George.\n\nThe next year, the Raiders were one of several teams that joined the breakaway [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] competition. Mal Meninga made a return to the club, this time as coach. Canberra lost in the preliminary final to eventual grand-finalists, the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]].\n\nIt was upon rejoining the newly formed [[National Rugby League]] the following year that the team began their decline. The Raiders' problems came to a head in the late 1990s, when club legends Ricky Stuart ([[Laurie Daley]] succeeded him as club captain) and [[Bradley Clyde]] were forced out in order to accommodate players such as [[Brett Finch]]. Finch would ironically leave the Raiders soon after to play under Stuart, then a coach at the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]].\n\nThe Raiders had mixed results in the new millennium, often finishing just inside or just outside the final eight and usually being bundled out of the finals in the early weeks. [[Simon Woolford]] became captain of the club in 2001. [[Matthew Elliott (rugby league)|Matthew Elliott]] succeeded Mal Meninga as the Raiders' coach in 2002. In 2003, the Raiders unexpectedly led the competition for most of the season, almost clinching the minor premiership. They then lost narrowly to the [[Melbourne Storm]] in the opening finals game, but still advanced to Week 2 due to ladder position. In one of the closest games in recent history, the Raiders were eclipsed by one point in the preliminary final by the [[New Zealand Warriors]] and eliminated from the 2003 competition.\n\nMany fans believed the achievements of 2003 would be improved in the following years. However, the Raiders finished a disappointing 8th in 2004, being knocked out in week one of the finals by the Sydney Roosters. Club legends [[Ruben Wiki]] and [[Mark McLinden]] left the Raiders for other clubs in this year. Wiki's loss, in particular, was a bitter pill to swallow for many Raiders fans, as it was found that the New Zealand Warriors had significantly breached the salary cap in signing him. The 2005 side was written off by fans and critics alike, as the club's two major signings, [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]] and [[Matt Adamson]], were ageing veterans considered well past their prime. However, both, particularly Smith, proved formidable campaigners, and the Raiders were joint competition leaders in Round 10. But as the season progressed, injuries took their toll and the Raiders finished second last on points differential to the [[Newcastle Knights]].\n \n[[File:Raiders Tigers canberra stadium.jpg|thumb|Raiders playing the [[Wests Tigers|Tigers]] at Canberra Stadium, July 2006]]\n \nThe Raiders started [[2006 NRL season|Season 2006]] heavy favourites to run last, but despite this pessimism and heavy losses to the Knights and the Roosters early on, fought back and guaranteed themselves a finals berth with a round to play. 2006 saw club stalwarts [[Simon Woolford]], newly named captain, [[Clinton Schifcofske]] and the club's longest serving player, [[Jason Croker]], leave the club, going to St George Illawarra, the Queensland Reds [[rugby union]] team and [[Super League]] club the [[Catalans Dragons]] respectively. Outgoing backs Schifcofske and [[Adam Mogg]] both earned representative berths with Queensland in State of Origin. Saturday 9 September 2006 saw Jason Croker, Simon Woolford, Clinton Schifcofske, Michael Hodgson, Jason Smith and Adam Mogg all play their final games for the club. The round one finals series clash with the [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] saw the Raiders defeated 30\u201312 in slippery and muddy conditions at [[Telstra Stadium]], and eliminated from the 2006 premiership race. This was also the final match for coach Matthew Elliott, who is coaching Penrith in 2007. His replacement is former North Queensland Cowboys' assistant coach Neil Henry.\n\n==2007\u20132009==\nIn 2007, Canberra were an unknown quantity. Having lost star players such as Schifcofske, Smith, Croker and Woolford in key positions, the Raiders found themselves with a new captain in [[Alan Tongue]] relying on young, inexperienced players such as [[Todd Carney]], [[William Zillman]] and [[Michael Dobson (rugby)|Michael Dobson]] to step up and take on more prominent roles within the team. The sense of inexperience was reinforced by the selection of [[Neil Henry]] as coach, despite his lack of first-grade coaching experience. Though the Raiders were bolstered by late-season signings [[Neville Costigan]] and [[Matt Bickerstaff]], several critics believed that the Raiders' significant loss of experience would result in their \"winning\" the wooden spoon.<ref>{{cite web| work=[[Fairfax Media]] |author=Greg Prichard | title=Raiders seize the day|url=http://www.leaguehq.com.au/news/lhqmatchreport/raiders-seize-the-day/2007/04/02/1175366158476.html| date=2007-04-03 | accessdate=2009-07-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331180610/http://www.leaguehq.com.au/news/lhqmatchreport/raiders-seize-the-day/2007/04/02/1175366158476.html |archivedate=2009-03-31 }}</ref>\n\n2007 was, overall, a disappointing season for the Raiders, who finished in 14th place despite entering the top 8 midway through the season.

Worse, the three players afflicted, [[Will Zillman]], [[Lincoln Withers]] and [[Phil Graham]] are amongst the Raiders best players. Compounding this, talented back-rowers [[Neville Costigan]] and [[Tom Learoyd-Lahrs]] have spent minimal time on the field due to recurring minor injuries. The club has also suffered badly in the recruiting race, with Zillman and strong front rower Michael Weyman opting to go elsewhere next season,{{When|date=December 2016}} with indications that Costigan and Scott Logan will do the same. Additionally, half [[Michael Dobson (rugby league)|Michael Dobson]] left the club mid-season for the English club [[Hull Kingston Rovers|Hull KR]], due to lack of opportunities in Canberra. Finally, Coach [[Neil Henry]] exercised a get-out clause in his contract, and opted to move to the North Queensland Cowboys in 2009. Former player and club legend, but inexperienced coach, [[David Furner]] took over the coaching [[rein]]s over in 2009. To date, beyond a few talented youngsters, the club has yet to procure a single player of note for season 2009, and will once again be forced to rely on youthful talent. At Round 13, Canberra sat well outside the eight, and the season looked as though it could end with a whimper.{{According to whom|date=December 2016}}\n\nHowever, far from fading away, the Raiders bounced back with a comprehensive victory over the Brisbane Broncos and then proceeded to thrash the Canterbury Bulldogs, inflicting the worst loss on the Sydney-based club in over half a century. Despite successive losses to the Cronulla Sharks and defending premiers Melbourne Storm, Canberra fought hard in both games, then broke a 13-year losing streak in Wollongong (and ended a seven-match winning streak by the home team) with a win over St. George-Illawarra. The season highlight,{{According to whom|date=December 2016}} however, was a comprehensive 34\u201312 win over league leaders, the Sydney Roosters. With 7 rounds left in the 2008 premiership, Canberra sits just one point outside the top eight. With a comparatively friendly draw, playing several teams below them on the table, the Raiders are poised to sneak into the semi-finals for the first time in two years. After a comprehensive 74\u201312 win over the Panthers the Raiders moved into an unexpected{{According to whom|date=December 2016}} 6th spot on the ladder from 11th to almost cement a spot in the 2008 finals series with 4 games remaining. The raiders went closer to the top eight with two important wins against Newcastle and Souths, giving them a three match winning streak with two games remaining.\n\nThe season had not been without controversy, however, with star halfback [[Todd Carney]] and fullback [[Bronx Goodwin]] being stood down by the club after an altercation at a Canberra nightclub following the round 19 win against the Roosters.

Along with the [[Illawarra Steelers]], they became the first clubs from outside the [[Sydney]] area in over half a century to compete in the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership]]. The Raiders have competed in every season of top-level rugby league in Australia since then and have won a total of three premierships: 1989, 1990 and 1994.\n\n==Establishment==\nIn 1981, the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]] (NSWRFL) decided to expand the number of teams in its [[Sydney]]-based [[NSWRFL premiership|premiership]] for the first time since the 1960s. This time it would venture further out into the state of [[New South Wales]] by introducing two teams from outside Sydney. The Canberra franchise was accepted as the 14th team to compete in the NSWRFL premiership for the [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982 season]], beating bids from Campbelltown, Newcastle and the Central Coast.  They were admitted along with the [[Illawarra Steelers]], of Wollongong. Thus the Canberra club, being in the [[Australian Capital Territory]], was the first team ever from an Australian state other than New South Wales to compete in the premiership.\n\nThe initially unnamed team decided to adopt the name \"Raiders\", which was coined by the media in reference to the team being the first based outside Sydney since the old [[Newcastle Rebels|Newcastle]] team left the League in 1909.\n\n==1982-86==\nThe club's first coach was former Australian international player and Easts coach, [[Don Furner]] who was coaching in the nearby town of [[Queanbeyan]] at the time. Their inaugural captain was Balmain forward, [[David Grant (rugby league)|David Grant]]. Canberra's initial seasons were a mixed bag and they became notorious for late game collapses, leading to the nickname \"Canberra Faders\". In fact, no team had conceded more tries in a season than the 1982 Raiders. The club's first win, a 12-11 heartstopper v [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], came in its 8th match, and 3 more wins followed, most notably against then competition leaders [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|Souths]]. The team earned the [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]] in their debut year, although this would be the last time they did so.\n\n1983 saw a new captain, Newtown and former Kangaroos back, [[Allan McMahon]], and nine wins, more than doubling 1982's four. However, the team continued to struggle to win away from home. [[Ron Giteau]] was handed the captaincy in 1984 and an away win first up that year foreshadowed a much improved season, a positive winning record (13-11) snagging a playoff for fifth versus Souths. But this game was lost (4-23), and the Raiders had still not succeeded in reaching the semi-finals of the competition.\n\n1985 saw [[Dean Lance]] named captain of the club which had a regression, with the team winning only 8 games (though the reserves did reach the Grand Final). Though 1986 was similarly disappointing, the team had a core group of players, such as [[Mal Meninga]], [[Gary Belcher]], [[Steve Walters]], and [[John Ferguson (rugby league)|John Ferguson]] who would greatly influence the coming decade. Belcher became the first Raiders player to be selected to make his d\u00e9but for the Australian national side in 1986.\n\n== 1987-1995 ==\nThis was the most successful period in the Raiders' short history, with 5 Grand Finals and 3 premierships. In 1987, Souths' Brisbane Rugby League premiership-winning coach and incumbent Queensland State of Origin coach, [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]] became Don Furner's co-coach at Canberra. [[Laurie Daley]], [[Peter Jackson (rugby league)|Peter Jackson]] and [[Glenn Lazarus]] also debuted this year. The team finished third, resulting in a maiden semi-finals appearance. Despite losing their first finals match against Easts, the Raiders rallied to defeat Souths (46-12) and Easts again (32-24). The latter earned the team a place in the Grand Final, but they were never really competitive against minor premiers Manly, going down 8-18.\n\n1988 saw the departure of the Furner-Bennett coaching partnership and a new coach in Penrith's [[Tim Sheens]]. Notable players starting out in 1988 were [[Bradley Clyde]] and [[Ricky Stuart]]. The 1988 season featured free-scoring (over 100 tries in 22 games) and a number of large victories, with the team again finishing in third place on the ladder. Unfortunately, a narrow loss against [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury]] in the Major Semi-Final was followed by defeat against [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] and an early exit.\n\n[[Mal Meninga]] became captain of the club in 1989. With 5 rounds to play in the '89 season, Canberra were 7th and in danger of missing the semis. But a hard-fought 14-10 win over Easts started a 9-match winning streak, culminating in the club's first Premiership. In one of the all-time great Grand Finals, the Raiders sent the game into extra time after a late [[John Ferguson (rugby league)|John Ferguson]] try that was converted by Meninga. [[Steve Jackson (rugby league)|Steve Jackson]] scored the winning try to win the premiership for the Raiders. This memorable match is now commemorated each year with the [[1989 League Legends Cup]]. On 4 October, Canberra played British champions [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] in the [[1989 World Club Challenge]] at [[Old Trafford]], Manchester. The Raiders lost 18 to 30 in front of 30,768.\n\n1990 was a stellar year for the club at all levels. All three grades making the Grand Final, with only the reserves losing. The first grade side earned their first Minor Premiership and a second consecutive title, defeating [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] in the decider.\n\nTrouble brewed in 1991 as the club was embroiled in [[salary cap]] hardships. On 3 April, [[NSWRL]] general manager [[John Quayle (rugby league)|John Quayle]] revealed that Canberra were in breach of their salary cap when they won the previous year's premiership.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last =AAP\n  | first = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Melbourne Storm salary cap quotes\n  | work = The Roar\n  | place =Australia\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | publisher = The Roar Sports Opinion\n  | date = 2010-04-22\n  | url = http://www.theroar.com.au/2010/04/22/melbourne-storm-salary-cap-quotes/\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-22}}</ref> Nonetheless, a fourth Grand Final berth was secured - the team's third in a row. However, the team went down to Penrith in a repeat of the 1990 Grand Final. [[Jason Croker]], who would go on to become the team's longest serving player, debuted this year. The fallout from the salary cap imbroglio saw several players leave the club, most prominently [[Glenn Lazarus]], [[Brent Todd]], [[David Barnhill]], [[Nigel Gaffey]] and [[Paul Martin]]. An average performance resulted, with the Raiders missing the finals for the first time since 1986.\n\n[[David Furner]], son of the Raiders' inaugural coach [[Don Furner]], started out in 1992. The club finished 12th and failed to reach the finals. 1993 was a marked improvement, with the Raiders sitting in first place on the ladder with 2 rounds remaining when tragedy struck during their record breaking 68 - 0 victory over Parramatta at Bruce Stadium.  Ricky Stuart suffered a bad leg break and the team went on to lose its next three games against Brisbane, St George and Canterbury.  Having beaten all three of these teams recently in the season the Raiders were well placed to secure another Grand Final berth before the injury occurred.\n\n1994 was the last season of the Raiders' and Australia's test captain, Mal Meninga. Canberra finished the regular season in 3rd place and successfully played their way to the grand final once again. Meninga went out in style, scoring the final try of the match as the Raiders scored their 3rd premiership in six seasons.\n\nWith the retirement of Meninga, Ricky Stuart was named as captain of the club in 1995. That season they finished second, but lost in the preliminary finals.\n\n==1996-2006==\nSince their final premiership in 1994, the Raiders have been unable to scale their previous heights, largely due to their inability to lure representative players to the capital. The team bowed out in Round 1 of the 1996 finals series, losing to St George.\n\nThe next year, the Raiders were one of several teams that joined the breakaway [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] competition. Mal Meninga made a return to the club, this time as coach. Canberra lost in the preliminary final to eventual grand-finalists, the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]].\n\nIt was upon rejoining the newly formed [[National Rugby League]] the following year that the team began their decline. The Raiders' problems came to a head in the late 1990s, when club legends Ricky Stuart ([[Laurie Daley]] succeeded him as club captain) and [[Bradley Clyde]] were forced out in order to accommodate players such as [[Brett Finch]]. Finch would ironically leave the Raiders soon after to play under Stuart, then a coach at the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]].\n\nThe Raiders had mixed results in the new millennium, often finishing just inside or just outside the final eight and usually being bundled out of the finals in the early weeks. [[Simon Woolford]] became captain of the club in 2001. [[Matthew Elliott (rugby league)|Matthew Elliott]] succeeded Mal Meninga as the Raiders' coach in 2002. In 2003, the Raiders unexpectedly led the competition for most of the season, almost clinching the minor premiership. They then lost narrowly to the [[Melbourne Storm]] in the opening finals game, but still advanced to Week 2 due to ladder position. In one of the closest games in recent history, the Raiders were eclipsed by one point in the preliminary final by the [[New Zealand Warriors]] and eliminated from the 2003 competition.\n\nMany fans believed the achievements of 2003 would be improved in the following years. However, the Raiders finished a disappointing 8th in 2004, being knocked out in week one of the finals by the Sydney Roosters. Club legends [[Ruben Wiki]] and [[Mark McLinden]] left the Raiders for other clubs in this year. Wiki's loss, in particular, was a bitter pill to swallow for many Raiders fans, as it was found that the New Zealand Warriors had significantly breached the salary cap in signing him. The 2005 side was written off by fans and critics alike, as the club's two major signings, [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]] and [[Matt Adamson]], were ageing veterans considered well past their prime. However, both, particularly Smith, proved formidable campaigners, and the Raiders were joint competition leaders in Round 10. But as the season progressed, injuries took their toll and the Raiders finished second last on points differential to the [[Newcastle Knights]].\n \n[[File:Raiders Tigers canberra stadium.jpg|thumb|Raiders playing the [[Wests Tigers|Tigers]] at Canberra Stadium, July 2006]]\n \nThe Raiders started [[2006 NRL season|Season 2006]] heavy favourites to run last, but despite this pessimism and heavy losses to the Knights and the Roosters early on, fought back and guaranteed themselves a finals berth with a round to play. 2006 saw club stalwarts [[Simon Woolford]], newly named captain, [[Clinton Schifcofske]] and the club's longest serving player, [[Jason Croker]], leave the club, going to St George Illawarra, the Queensland Reds [[rugby union]] team and [[Super League]] club the [[Catalans Dragons]] respectively. Outgoing backs Schifcofske and [[Adam Mogg]] both earned representative berths with Queensland in State of Origin. Saturday 9 September 2006 saw Jason Croker, Simon Woolford, Clinton Schifcofske, Michael Hodgson, Jason Smith and Adam Mogg all play their final games for the club. The round one finals series clash with the [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] saw the Raiders defeated 30-12 in slippery and muddy conditions at [[Telstra Stadium]], and eliminated from the 2006 premiership race. This was also the final match for coach Matthew Elliott, who is coaching Penrith in 2007. His replacement is former North Queensland Cowboys' assistant coach Neil Henry.\n\n==2007\u20132009==\nIn 2007, Canberra were an unknown quantity. Having lost star players such as Schifcofske, Smith, Croker and Woolford in key positions, the Raiders found themselves with a new captain in [[Alan Tongue]] relying on young, inexperienced players such as [[Todd Carney]], [[William Zillman]] and [[Michael Dobson (rugby)|Michael Dobson]] to step up and take on more prominent roles within the team. The sense of inexperience was reinforced by the selection of [[Neil Henry]] as coach, despite his lack of first-grade coaching experience. Though the Raiders were bolstered by late-season signings [[Neville Costigan]] and [[Matt Bickerstaff]], several critics believed that the Raiders' significant loss of experience would result in their \"winning\" the wooden spoon.<ref>{{cite web| work=[[Fairfax Media]] |author=Greg Prichard | title=Raiders seize the day|url=http://www.leaguehq.com.au/news/lhqmatchreport/raiders-seize-the-day/2007/04/02/1175366158476.html| date=2007-04-03 | accessdate=2009-07-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331180610/http://www.leaguehq.com.au/news/lhqmatchreport/raiders-seize-the-day/2007/04/02/1175366158476.html |archivedate=2009-03-31 }}</ref>\n\n2007 was, overall, a disappointing season for the Raiders, who finished in 14th place despite entering the top 8 midway through the season.

Worse, the three players afflicted, [[Will Zillman]], [[Lincoln Withers]] and [[Phil Graham]] are amongst the Raiders best players. Compounding this, talented back-rowers [[Neville Costigan]] and [[Tom Learoyd-Lahrs]] have spent minimal time on the field due to recurring minor injuries. The club has also suffered badly in the recruiting race, with Zillman and strong front rower Michael Weyman opting to go elsewhere next season,{{When|date=December 2016}} with indications that Costigan and Scott Logan will do the same. Additionally, half [[Michael Dobson (rugby league)|Michael Dobson]] left the club mid-season for the English club [[Hull Kingston Rovers|Hull KR]], due to lack of opportunities in Canberra. Finally, Coach [[Neil Henry]] exercised a get-out clause in his contract, and opted to move to the North Queensland Cowboys in 2009. Former player and club legend, but inexperienced coach, [[David Furner]] took over the coaching [[rein]]s over in 2009. To date, beyond a few talented youngsters, the club has yet to procure a single player of note for season 2009, and will once again be forced to rely on youthful talent. At Round 13, Canberra sat well outside the eight, and the season looked as though it could end with a whimper.{{According to whom|date=December 2016}}\n\nHowever, far from fading away, the Raiders bounced back with a comprehensive victory over the Brisbane Broncos and then proceeded to thrash the Canterbury Bulldogs, inflicting the worst loss on the Sydney-based club in over half a century. Despite successive losses to the Cronulla Sharks and defending premiers Melbourne Storm, Canberra fought hard in both games, then broke a 13-year losing streak in Wollongong (and ended a seven-match winning streak by the home team) with a win over St. George-Illawarra. The season highlight,{{According to whom|date=December 2016}} however, was a comprehensive 34\u201312 win over league leaders, the Sydney Roosters. With 7 rounds left in the 2008 premiership, Canberra sits just one point outside the top eight. With a comparatively friendly draw, playing several teams below them on the table, the Raiders are poised to sneak into the semi-finals for the first time in two years. After a comprehensive 74-12 win over the Panthers the Raiders moved into an unexpected{{According to whom|date=December 2016}} 6th spot on the ladder from 11th to almost cement a spot in the 2008 finals series with 4 games remaining. The raiders went closer to the top eight with two important wins against Newcastle and Souths, giving them a three match winning streak with two games remaining.\n\nThe season had not been without controversy, however, with star halfback [[Todd Carney]] and fullback [[Bronx Goodwin]] being stood down by the club after an altercation at a Canberra nightclub following the round 19 win against the Roosters. Carney was eventually dismissed by the club after failing to agree to the punishment plan the club had laid out for him, Goodwin's was sacked by the club however he appealed this decision and take it to the  Industrial Relations Commission.

However, losses to Todd Carney's new club the [[Sydney Roosters|Roosters]] in round six and a narrow loss at home to [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] in round seven saw the club sitting second from last after round seven (last had the [[Melbourne Storm]] not been stripped of competition points due to salary cap breaches) of the 2010 season. Wins over the ladder-leading Dragons and the [[Gold Coast Titans]] followed until a four-game losing streak ensued; with the club sitting third from last after a round 17 home loss to the Roosters in what was [[Todd Carney]]'s return to the nation's capital. The Raiders then began a run similar to that of [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] last year; winning eight of their next nine regular season matches to sneak into the top eight by season's end. The regular season's highest home attendance came when 20,445 fans filled Canberra Stadium to see the Raiders defeat the ladder-leading Dragons 32-16 for the second time in the season.\n\nCanberra advanced to the finals on the back of eight wins from their past nine and were drawn a tough away final against the second-placed [[Penrith Panthers]] whom the Raiders had beaten just five weeks earlier. The Raiders led from the start and despite lapses at times during the match the Raiders managed to sniff out a narrow 24-22 win, thus achieving its first final win in a decade, which ironically was also against the Panthers. This saw the Raiders draw a home final against the [[Wests Tigers]] in round two of the finals. Having lost to the Tigers twice during the regular season, it was hoped that a record crowd of 26,746 would inspire the Raiders to continue their fairytale run deep into the finals, however a missed penalty attempt by [[Jarrod Croker]] in the final minutes of the match saw Canberra lose by 26-24 and therefore draw a curtain on the Raiders' 2010 season.\nThe Raiders off season didn't start well, with Joel Monaghan being sacked by the club for inappropriate behaviour with a teammate's dog.

{"title_page": "Complexity class", "text_new": "[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among several important complexity classes]]\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], a '''complexity class''' is a set of [[Computational problem|problems]] of related resource-based complexity. A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm.

In particular:\n* The classes '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''', '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''', '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''', and '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' are defined using the [[probabilistic Turing machine]]\n* The classes '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' and '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' are defined using the [[interactive proof system]]\n* The class '''[[P/poly]]''' and its subclasses '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]''' are defined using the [[boolean circuit]]\n* The classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''' are defined using the [[quantum Turing machine]]\n\n====Randomized computation====\n{{Main|Probabilistic Turing machine}}\n\nA number of important complexity classes are defined using the ''[[probabilistic Turing machine]]'', a variant of the [[Turing machine]] that can toss random coins. These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of error that is allowed. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\n[[File:Randomized Complexity Classes.svg|thumb|The relationships between the fundamental probabilistic complexity classes. BQP is a quantum complexity class and is described in the quantum computing section.]]\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0. Intuitively, this is the strictest class of probabilistic problems because it demands ''no error whatsoever''. A slightly looser class is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), which maintains no error for strings not in the language but allows bounded error for strings in the language. More formally, a language is in '''RP''' if there is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine <math>M</math> such that if a string is not in the language then <math>M</math> always rejects and if a string is in the language then <math>M</math> accepts with a probability at least 1/2. The class '''co-RP''' is similarly defined except the roles are flipped: error is not allowed for strings in the language but is allowed for strings not in the language. Taken together, the classes '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' encompass all of the problems that can be solved by probabilistic Turing machines with [[one-sided error]]. Loosening the error requirements further to allow for [[two-sided error]] yields the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability less than 1/3 (for both strings in the language and not in the language). '''BPP''' is the most practically relevant of the probabilistic complexity classes\u2014most problems of interest in '''BPP''' have efficient probabilistic algorithms that can be run quickly on real computers. '''BPP''' is also at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown. The broadest class of efficiently-solvable probabilistic problems is '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' (probabilistic polynomial time), the set of languages solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all strings.\n\n'''ZPP''', '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' are all subsets of '''BPP'''. The reason for this is intuitive: the classes allowing zero error and only one-sided error are all contained within the class that allows for two-sided error. '''BPP''' is a subset of '''PP'''. '''ZPP''' relates to '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' in the following way: '''ZPP'''<math>=</math>'''RP'''<math>\\cap</math>'''co-RP''', that is, '''ZPP''' consists exactly of those problems that are in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Intuitively, this follows from the fact that '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' allow only one-sided error. A problem in '''RP''' allows error only for strings in the language. But a problem in '''co-RP''' allows error only for strings not in the language, i.e. it disallows error for strings in the language. Hence, if a problem is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP''', then there must be no error for strings in the language. A similar argument shows that no error is allowed for strings not in the language if the language is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Together, this means that no error is allowed whatsoever, which is exactly the definition of '''ZPP'''.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a trustworthy \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting only if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuits====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the language <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in <math>\\mathsf{TIME}(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class because it turns out that it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

In particular:\n* The classes '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''', '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''', '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''', and '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' are defined using the [[probabilistic Turing machine]]\n* The classes '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' and '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' are defined using the [[interactive proof system]]\n* The class '''[[P/poly]]''' and its subclasses '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]''' are defined using the [[boolean circuit]]\n* The classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''' are defined using the [[quantum Turing machine]]\n\n====Randomized computation====\n{{Main|Probabilistic Turing machine}}\n\nA number of important complexity classes are defined using the ''[[probabilistic Turing machine]]'', a variant of the [[Turing machine]] that can toss random coins. These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of error that is allowed. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\n[[File:Randomized Complexity Classes.svg|thumb|The relationships between the fundamental probabilistic complexity classes. BQP is a quantum complexity class and is described in the quantum computing section.]]\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0. Intuitively, this is the strictest class of probabilistic problems because it demands ''no error whatsoever''. A slightly looser class is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), which maintains no error for strings not in the language but allows bounded error for strings in the language. More formally, a language is in '''RP''' if there is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine <math>M</math> such that if a string is not in the language then <math>M</math> always rejects and if a string is in the language then <math>M</math> accepts with a probability at least 1/2. The class '''co-RP''' is similarly defined except the roles are flipped: error is not allowed for strings in the language but is allowed for strings not in the language. Taken together, the classes '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' encompass all of the problems that can be solved by probabilistic Turing machines with [[one-sided error]]. Loosening the error requirements further to allow for [[two-sided error]] yields the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability less than 1/3 (for both strings in the language and not in the language). '''BPP''' is the most practically relevant of the probabilistic complexity classes\u2014most problems of interest in '''BPP''' have efficient probabilistic algorithms that can be run quickly on real computers. '''BPP''' is also at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown. The broadest class of efficiently-solvable probabilistic problems is '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' (probabilistic polynomial time), the set of languages solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all strings.\n\n'''ZPP''', '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' are all subsets of '''BPP'''. The reason for this is intuitive: the classes allowing zero error and only one-sided error are all contained within the class that allows for two-sided error. '''BPP''' is a subset of '''PP'''. '''ZPP''' relates to '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' in the following way: '''ZPP'''<math>=</math>'''RP'''<math>\\cap</math>'''co-RP''', that is, '''ZPP''' consists exactly of those problems that are in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Intuitively, this follows from the fact that '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' allow only one-sided error. A problem in '''RP''' allows error only for strings in the language. But a problem in '''co-RP''' allows error only for strings not in the language, i.e. it disallows error for strings in the language. Hence, if a problem is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP''', then there must be no error for strings in the language. A similar argument shows that no error is allowed for strings not in the language if the language is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Together, this means that no error is allowed whatsoever, which is exactly the definition of '''ZPP'''.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a trustworthy \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting only if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuits====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the language <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in '''TIME'''<math>(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class because it turns out that it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

Walpole is also the longest-serving British prime minister by this definition.{{sfn|BBC News|1998}} However, [[Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was the first and [[Margaret Thatcher]] the longest-serving prime minister officially referred to as such in the order of precedence.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackay|1y=1987|2a1=Marriott|2y=1923|2p=83}} The first to use the title in an official act was [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who signed the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] as \"Prime Minister of her Britannic Majesty\" in 1878.{{sfn|Bogdanor|1997}}\n\nStrictly, the first prime minister of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Ireland)]] was [[William Pitt the Younger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burt|1y=1874|1p=106|2a1=Castlereagh|2y=1805}} The first prime minister of the current United Kingdom, i.e. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was [[Bonar Law]],{{sfn|Law|1922}} although the country was not renamed officially until 1927, when [[Stanley Baldwin]] was the serving prime minister.{{sfn|Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act|1927}}\n\nDue to the gradual evolution of the post of prime minister, the title is applied to early prime ministers only retrospectively;{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=1}} this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Lord Bath]] and [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|Lord Waldegrave]] are sometimes listed as prime ministers.{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} Bath was invited to [[Short-lived ministry|form a ministry]] by [[George II of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George II}}]] when [[Henry Pelham]] resigned in 1746,{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=47}} as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of [[William Pitt the Elder]],{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} who dominated the affairs of government [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|during the Seven Years' War]].

The last Lords High Treasurer, [[Lord Godolphin]] (1702\u20131710) and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Lord Oxford]] (1711\u20131714),{{sfnm|1a1=Fisher Russell Barker|1y=1890|2a1=Stephen|2y=1890}} ran the government of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].{{sfn|Morrill|2018}}\n\nAfter the succession of [[George I of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George I}}]] in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury (as opposed to a single Lord High Treasurer) became permanent.{{sfn|Chapman|2002|page=15}} For the next three years, the government was headed by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department]].{{sfn|McMullen Rigg|1899}} Subsequently, [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] ran the government jointly,{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland domestic.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Stanhope died in February 1721 and Sunderland resigned two months later;{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Townshend and [[Robert Walpole]] were then invited to form the next government.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911b|2a1=McMullen Rigg|2y=1899}} From that point, the holder of the {{em|office}} of First Lord also usually (albeit unofficially) held the status of prime minister.

There is no specific date for when the office of prime minister first appeared, as the role was not created but rather evolved over a period of time through a merger of duties.{{sfn|Hennessy|2001|pp=39\u201340}} However, the term was regularly if informally used of Walpole by the 1730s.<ref>Stephen Taylor ODNB</ref> It was used in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] as early as 1805,{{sfn|Castlereagh|1805}} and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s.{{sfnm|1a1=Eardley-Wilmot|1y=1885|2a1=Macfarlane|2y=1885}} In 1905 the post of prime minister was officially given recognition in the [[Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom|order of precedence]].{{sfn|Marriott|1923|page=83}} Modern historians generally consider [[Sir Robert Walpole]], who led the government of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] for over twenty years from 1721,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1999|1p=266|2a1=Hennessy|2y=2001|2pp=39\u201340}} as the first prime minister. Walpole is also the longest-serving British prime minister by this definition.{{sfn|BBC News|1998}} However, [[Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was the first and [[Margaret Thatcher]] the longest-serving prime minister officially referred to as such in the order of precedence.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackay|1y=1987|2a1=Marriott|2y=1923|2p=83}} The first to use the title in an official act was [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who signed the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] as \"Prime Minister of her Britannic Majesty\" in 1878.{{sfn|Bogdanor|1997}}\n\nStrictly, the first prime minister of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Ireland)]] was [[William Pitt the Younger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burt|1y=1874|1p=106|2a1=Castlereagh|2y=1805}} The first prime minister of the current United Kingdom, i.e. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was [[Bonar Law]],{{sfn|Law|1922}} although the country was not renamed officially until 1927, when [[Stanley Baldwin]] was the serving prime minister.{{sfn|Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act|1927}}\n\nDue to the gradual evolution of the post of prime minister, the title is applied to early prime ministers only retrospectively;{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=1}} this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Lord Bath]] and [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|Lord Waldegrave]] are sometimes listed as prime ministers.{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} Bath was invited to [[Short-lived ministry|form a ministry]] by [[George II of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George II}}]] when [[Henry Pelham]] resigned in 1746,{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=47}} as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of [[William Pitt the Elder]],{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} who dominated the affairs of government [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|during the Seven Years' War]]. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days,{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} and Waldegrave after three.{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office as prime minister,{{sfn|''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''|2011}} and they are therefore not listed.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Before 1721== \nPrior to the [[Georgian era]], the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]] was led by the [[Lord High Treasurer]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} By the late [[Tudor period]], the Lord High Treasurer was regarded as one of the [[Great Officers of State]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} and was often (though not always) the dominant figure in government: [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1547\u20131549),{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} served as [[Lord Protector]] to his prepubescent nephew [[Edward VI of England|{{nowrap|Edward VI}}]];{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1572\u20131598),{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} was the dominant [[List of ministers to Queen Elizabeth I|minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}}]];{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} Burghley's son [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], succeeded his father as chief minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}} (1598\u20131603) and was eventually appointed by [[James VI and I|{{nowrap|James I}}]] as Lord High Treasurer (1608\u20131612).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911c}}\n\nBy the late [[Stuart period]], the Treasury was often run not by a single individual, i.e. Lord High Treasurer, but by a [[wikt:commission#Noun|commission]] of [[Lords of the Treasury]],{{sfn|Chapman|2002}} led by the [[First Lord of the Treasury]]. The last Lords High Treasurer, [[Lord Godolphin]] (1702\u20131710) and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Lord Oxford]] (1711\u20131714),{{sfnm|1a1=Fisher Russell Barker|1y=1890|2a1=Stephen|2y=1890}} ran the government of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].{{sfn|Morrill|2018}}\n\nAfter the succession of [[George I of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George I}}]] in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury (as opposed to a single Lord High Treasurer) became permanent.{{sfn|Chapman|2002|page=15}} For the next three years, the government was headed by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department]].{{sfn|McMullen Rigg|1899}} Subsequently, [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] ran the government jointly,{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland domestic.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Stanhope died in February 1721 and Sunderland resigned two months later;{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Townshend and [[Robert Walpole]] were then invited to form the next government.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911b|2a1=McMullen Rigg|2y=1899}} From that point, the holder of the {{em|office}} of First Lord also usually (albeit unofficially) held the status of prime minister.
