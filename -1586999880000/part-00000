His [[National Football League (Ireland)|league]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|championship]] career with the [[Meath GAA|Meath]] senior team spanned twenty years from 1975 to 1995.\n\nBorn in Aughavas, [[County Leitrim]], O'Rourke was raised in [[Skryne]], [[County Meath]] after his family moved there in his youth. He played competitive Gaelic football during his schooling at [[St Patrick's Classical School]] in [[Navan]]. O'Rourke first appeared for the [[Skryne GFC|Skryne]] club at underage levels, before winning two [[Meath Senior Football Championship|county senior championship]] medals in 1992 and 1993. While studying at [[University College Dublin]] he won a [[Sigerson Cup]] medal in 1979.\n\nO'Rourke made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was picked for the Meath minor team. He later joined the under-21 side but enjoyed little success in these grades. O'Rourke made his senior debut during the [[1975-76 National Football League (Ireland)|1975-76 league]]. Over the course of the next twenty years he was a regular member of the starting fifteen and won back-to-back [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland]] medals in 1987 and 1988. He also won five [[Leinster Senior Football Championship|Leinster]] medals, three [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] medals and was named [[Texaco Footballer of the Year|Footballer of the Year]] in 1991. O'Rourke played his last game for Meath in July 1995.\n\nIn retirement from playing O'Rourke combined his teaching career with a new position as a sports broadcaster. His media career began with [[RT\u00c9]] where he has worked as a studio analyst with the flagship programme ''[[The Sunday Game]]'' for over twenty-five years. O'Rourke also writes a weekly column for the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]''.\n\n==Early and family life==\nDespite becoming a Meath county footballer, O'Rourke is not a Meathman by birth; he was born in the small parish of Aughavas within [[County Leitrim]].<ref name=\"HoganStand\">{{cite news | url = http://www.hoganstand.com/Meath/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=48494 | title = Colm O'Rourke Happy 51st | work=The Hogan Stand | publisher = Lynn Publications | date = 13 September 1991 | accessdate=16 September 2006}}</ref> He moved with his family as a youngster from Leitrim to [[County Meath]]\n\nO'Rourke is a descendant of the U\u00ed Ruairc royal house of [[Breffni]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} He has, however, been accepted by the people of [[Skryne]] in Meath as one of their own forty years after arriving from Aughavas.\n\nO'Rourke's son [[Shane O'Rourke|Shane]] also played with the Meath senior football team, while his nephew [[Patrick O'Rourke (Gaelic footballer)|Paddy]] has played as a goalkeeper for Meath.\n\n==Playing career==\nAs a Gaelic footballer, O'Rourke won two [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland]] medals with Meath, in 1987 and 1988.

His performance, playing with a bandaged knee, in the Dublin-Meath matches of the summer of 1991 are still recounted in Meath.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} When playing for Meath he was part of a full forward line of himself, [[Brian Stafford]] and [[Bernard Flynn]], often considered to be one of the best full-forward lines of all time.\n\n==Management career==\nO'Rourke has managed Simonstown Gaels GFC in Navan, guiding them to two Meath Senior Football Finals in 2003 and 2004, only for the team to lose on both occasions. He also guided the club to its first adult title in 2005 when it won the Meath Football League Division 1.\n\nO'Rourke managed Ireland's team that competed in the [[International rules football|Compromise Rules]] competition on two outings, 1998 and 1999.\n\nO'Rourke is currently{{when|date=June 2018}} the manager for the Senior men's team in St. Patrick's Classical School, they compete in the A division and in 2001, 2003 and 2004 they won the Hogan cup in the All-Ireland, they have got to the All-Ireland many of a time more recently in 2013.\n\nHe is continuously being linked with managing the Meath senior football team, previously held by [[Se\u00e1n Boylan]], another man with [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]] connections.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Teaching==\nO'Rourke is the secondary school principal in [[St Patrick's Classical School]] in [[Navan]] where he has trained the Gaelic football team to numerous successes at provincial and national level throughout the past two decades.<ref>Yearbook of St. Patrick's Classical School, 2013</ref>\n\nDespite his classical education, he has been known to mix up his [[Latin]] with his [[Greek language|Greek]] in public.<ref>{{cite news|first=Colm|last=O'Rourke|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/colm-orourke-donegal-in-need-of-bite-to-match-their-bark-in-order-to-overcome-mayo-38351575.html|title=Donegal in need of bite to match their bark in order to overcome Mayo|work=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]|date=28 July 2019|quote=Jim Gavin has it all sorted.

His [[National Football League (Ireland)|league]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|championship]] career with the [[Meath GAA|Meath]] senior team spanned twenty years from 1975 to 1995.\n\nBorn in Aughavas, [[County Leitrim]], O'Rourke was raised in [[Skryne]], [[County Meath]] after his family moved there in his youth. He played competitive Gaelic football during his schooling at [[St Patrick's Classical School]] in [[Navan]]. O'Rourke first appeared for the [[Skryne GFC|Skryne]] club at underage levels, before winning two [[Meath Senior Football Championship|county senior championship]] medals in 1992 and 1993. While studying at [[University College Dublin]] he won a [[Sigerson Cup]] medal in 1979.\n\nO'Rourke made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was picked for the Meath minor team. He later joined the under-21 side but enjoyed little success in these grades. O'Rourke made his senior debut during the [[1975-76 National Football League (Ireland)|1975-76 league]]. Over the course of the next twenty years he was a regular member of the starting fifteen and won back-to-back [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland]] medals in 1987 and 1988. He also won five [[Leinster Senior Football Championship|Leinster]] medals, three [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] medals and was named [[Texaco Footballer of the Year|Footballer of the Year]] in 1991. O'Rourke played his last game for Meath in July 1995.\n\nIn retirement from playing O'Rourke combined his teaching career with a new position as a sports broadcaster. His media career began with [[RT\u00c9]] where he has worked as a studio analyst with the flagship programme ''[[The Sunday Game]]'' for over twenty-five years. O'Rourke also writes a weekly column for the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]''.\n\n==Early and family life==\nDespite becoming a Meath county footballer, O'Rourke is not a Meathman by birth; he was born in the small parish of Aughavas within [[County Leitrim]].<ref name=\"HoganStand\">{{cite news | url = http://www.hoganstand.com/Meath/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=48494 | title = Colm O'Rourke Happy 51st | work=The Hogan Stand | publisher = Lynn Publications | date = 13 September 1991 | accessdate=16 September 2006}}</ref> He moved with his family as a youngster from Leitrim to [[County Meath]]\n\nO'Rourke is a descendant of the U\u00ed Ruairc royal house of [[Breffni]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} He has, however, been accepted by the people of [[Skryne]] in Meath as one of their own forty years after arriving from Aughavas.\n\nO'Rourke's son [[Shane O'Rourke|Shane]] also played with the Meath senior football team, while his nephew [[Patrick O'Rourke (Gaelic footballer)|Paddy]] has played as a goalkeeper for Meath.\n\n==Playing career==\nAs a Gaelic footballer, O'Rourke won two [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland]] medals with Meath, in 1987 and 1988.

A [[tornado emergency]] was issued following real-time confirmation of a large tornado just west of Monroe.

A metal building structure was damaged while a wooden power pole and steel street light assembly were snapped.

One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado rolled a mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home. One fatality and one serious injury occurred in the county. Crossing into Lawrence County, it caused extensive tree damage with numerous hardwood and softwood trees snapped or uprooted.
