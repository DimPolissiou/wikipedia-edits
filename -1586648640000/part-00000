Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the Macdonald Engineering Building, prior to its burning down in 1903. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref name=McGillBeginning />\n\nIn 1903, Capper returned to England to establish the School of Architecture at [[Victoria University of Manchester]], which was the fourth university architecture school to be established in the British Commonwealth, after [[University of Toronto]] (1890), [[University of Liverpool]] (l894) and McGill (1896).<ref name=McGillBeginning /> The second director of the School, [[Percy Nobbs]], arrived at McGill in 1903 to only two students: H.&nbsp;E.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=McGillBeginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]], a former student at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris. Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the Macdonald Engineering Building, prior to its burning down in 1903. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder.<ref name=McGillBeginning />}} and Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, while Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref name=McGillBeginning />\n\nIn 1903, Capper returned to England to establish the School of Architecture at [[Victoria University of Manchester]], which was the fourth university architecture school to be established in the British Commonwealth, after [[University of Toronto]] (1890), [[University of Liverpool]] (l894) and McGill (1896).<ref name=McGillBeginning /> The second director of the School, [[Percy Nobbs]], arrived at McGill in 1903 to only two students: H.&nbsp;E. Shorey and Gordon H. Blackader, for whom the [[McGill School of Architecture#Libaries and collections|Blackader-Lauterman Library]] is named. Nobbs divided the four-year course into two streams, the BArch degree and the BSc degree in Architectural Engineering. Three new staff were hired in 1906, and three years later, [[Philip J.
