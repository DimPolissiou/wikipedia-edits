It was joined by [[Hornsey College of Art]], founded in 1882, Ponders End Technical Institute, founded in 1901, and Hendon Technical Institute, opened in 1939.\n\nIn 1973, these colleges and further institutions around North London formed '''Middlesex Polytechnic'''.

Roberts, who was chair of Enfield College's governing body from 1949 to 1968.\n* '''McCrae''' building was the first extension to Enfield Technical College. Built in 1955, it was later named after Roderick McCrae, who was the Principal from 1955 to 1962.\n* '''Pascal''' building is named after Eric Pascal who was Education Officer of the Borough of Enfield from before 1942 until 1945 or later, and clerk to the Governors of Enfield College from 1949 to 1965. The campus was closed in July 2008, and the majority of departments moved to the extended Hendon campus and some to the Archway Campus shared with UCL.\n\n==== Cat Hill ====\nIn March 2011 Cat Hill campus was sold to the L&Q housing association as part of the university's plans to centralise its courses in Hendon.<ref name=\"enfind\">{{cite news|last=Hardiman|first=David|url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/8936296.New_homes_planned_for_Cat_Hill_campus/|title=New Homes Planned for Cat Hill Campus|work=Enfield Independent|date=28 March 2011|accessdate=30 March 2011|location=London, United Kingdom}}</ref> The campus closed in September 2011 and students moved to a new \u00a380&nbsp;million 'Grove' building on the university's Hendon campus.<ref name=\"enfind\"/>\n\nCat Hill Campus was located in [[Cockfosters]].

The name change was a result of the 1964 union of St Katharine's with Berridge House, [[Hampstead]], on the Tottenham site. The college expanded in the 1960s, although much of the campus retained its Victorian architecture. The College was highly regarded while part of the University of London, but its reputation suffered almost immediately once it was incorporated into Middlesex. After the closure of the college and the union with Middlesex Polytechnic, the 'All Saints' campus was home to humanities and cultural studies, business studies, law, sociology and women's studies, all of which have been moved to other campuses.

In 1901, [[Joseph Wilson Swan]] bought a house in [[Ponders End]] High Street that became the Ediswan Institute.<ref>Pam, D. (1977),''The New Enfield: Stories of Enfield Edmonton and Southgate, a Jubilee History'', London Borough of Enfield Libraries, Arts & Entertainment Dept</ref> Four years later Ediswan Institute was bought by Middlesex County Council and became the Ponders End Technical Institute. By 1937 The Ponders End Technical Institute was growing so rapidly that it was decided to build a new college across the road, in Queensway. Due to the [[Second World War]], it was not completed until 1953, but the unfinished buildings were in use throughout the war. By now it was called Enfield Technical College, but in 1962 it was renamed ''Enfield College of Technology'' by the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]]. In 1973 the college formed part of Middlesex Polytechnic.\n\nThere are four major buildings on campus: ''Broadbent'', ''Roberts building'' (or Tower Block), ''McCrae'' and ''Pascal''. They are named after people who helped to create it.\n* '''Broadbent''', the main building of Enfield Campus, is named after Henry Winterbottom Broadbent, a mechanical engineer who was appointed first Principal of Enfield Technical College in January 1941.\n* '''Roberts''' tower block was named after a local industrialist George A. Roberts, who was chair of Enfield College's governing body from 1949 to 1968.\n* '''McCrae''' building was the first extension to Enfield Technical College. Built in 1955, it was later named after Roderick McCrae, who was the Principal from 1955 to 1962.\n* '''Pascal''' building is named after Eric Pascal who was Education Officer of the Borough of Enfield from before 1942 until 1945 or later, and clerk to the Governors of Enfield College from 1949 to 1965. The campus was closed in July 2008, and the majority of departments moved to the extended Hendon campus and some to the Archway Campus shared with UCL.\n\n==== Cat Hill ====\nIn March 2011 Cat Hill campus was sold to the L&Q housing association as part of the university's plans to centralise its courses in Hendon.<ref name=\"enfind\">{{cite news|last=Hardiman|first=David|url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/8936296.New_homes_planned_for_Cat_Hill_campus/|title=New Homes Planned for Cat Hill Campus|work=Enfield Independent|date=28 March 2011|accessdate=30 March 2011|location=London, United Kingdom}}</ref> The campus closed in September 2011 and students moved to a new \u00a380&nbsp;million 'Grove' building on the university's Hendon campus.<ref name=\"enfind\"/>\n\nCat Hill Campus was located in [[Cockfosters]].

Whilst such banners of county arms are legally not generally available for public use, a similar design had been used traditionally as a local badge in Middlesex and neighbouring Essex for centuries. The seax is the symbol of the Saxons and the Saxon crown was added in 1909 to differentiate the arms and flag from those of Essex.\n\n===County day===\nMiddlesex Day is celebrated each year on 16 May. This commemorates the role of the 57th West Middlesex regiment in the [[Battle of Albuera]] (1811) in the [[Peninsular War]]. \nDuring the battle, [[William_Inglis_(British_Army_officer)|Lieutenant-Colonel William Inglis]], despite his injuries, refused to retire from the battle but remained with the regimental colours, encouraging his men with the words \"Die hard 57th, die hard!\" as they came under intense pressure from a French attack. The regiment held and the battle was won. The 'Die Hards' subsequently became the West Middlesex's regimental nickname and the phrase [[Die hard (phrase)|Die Hard]] entered the language. In 2003, an early day motion in the House of Commons noted the celebration of 16 May, the anniversary of Albuhera, as Middlesex Day.<ref>Randall J., [https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/22809/middlesex-day Early Day Motion 13 May 2003].

This is similar to what would be called a [[List of college athletic conferences|college athletic conference]] in the [[United States]]. Canada West is one of four such bodies that are members of the country's governing body for the National Collegiate Athletics Association [[NCAA]]. The other three regional associations coordinating university-level sports in Canada are [[Ontario University Athletics]] (OUA), [[Atlantic University Sport]] (AUS), and the [[Quebec Student Sport Federation]] (known by its French initialism of RSEQ).\n\n==History==\n\nThe Western Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union (WCIAU - later renamed Western Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Association) was formed in 1919-20 as the first recognized western-based post-secondary athletic organization in Canada, with the University of Manitoba winning the first-ever league championship, a men's hockey title, in 1920.\n\nIn the spring of 1972, the WCIAA was split into the Canada West Universities Athletic Association (CWUAA) and the Great Plains Athletic Association (GPAA - later renamed the Great Plains Athletic Conference).\n\nCWUAA consisted of schools spanning from Victoria to Saskatoon (Victoria, British Columbia, Calgary, Alberta, Lethbridge and Saskatchewan), while GPAA's member institutions stretched from Regina to Thunder Bay (Regina, Brandon, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Lakehead).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://canadawest.org/information/history|title=Canada West Universities Athletic Association|work=Canada West Universities Athletic Association|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Membership changes===\nIn 1985-86, Canada West offered playing privileges to men's hockey teams from the Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC) with other sports following over the years, culminating with the 2001-02 merger of basketball.\n\nSince 1999, 11 additional schools have joined the Canada West's six charter members. Trinity Western joined in 1999-00 and, in 2000-01, all schools from the Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC) except for Brandon were provided full membership in Canada West (Manitoba, Regina and Winnipeg). Brandon joined as an associate member at the time, until full membership was granted in 2005.\n\nSimon Fraser joined Canada West in 2000, followed by Thompson Rivers in 2005 and Fraser Valley in 2006.\n\nSimon Fraser withdrew from the conference as a member after the 2009-10 season, while both Thompson Rivers and Fraser Valley were awarded full membership in 2010 and, at the same time, UBC Okanagan received probationary membership.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.ok.ubc.ca/athrec/2010/09/01/1320/|title=UBC Okanagan joins Canada West; TRU & UFV full

Seated Capacity is the actual number of permanent seats, be they grandstands or permanently in use bleachers.

See [[UBC Thunderbirds#NCAA membership bid|the UBC article]] for more details.\n\n[[Simon Fraser Clan|Simon Fraser]] (known as the SFU Clan) did not compete in what is now known as U Sports until 2002, after a failed attempt to join the U.S. [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. On July 10, 2009 the NCAA accepted SFU's bid to join NCAA Division II in the 2011-2012 season. Canada West proceeded as a 13-team, 14 member conference for 2010-11, with the inclusion of UBC-Okanagan as a non-competing, probationary member for 2010-11, in time to begin competition (pending summer 2011 CIS approval) for the 2011-12 season. In May 2011 Mount Royal was awarded Canada West membership, effective Sept. 2011, with competition to begin in the 2012-13 season. In May 2013 MacEwan (Formally Grant MacEwan) approved as a 17th Canada West member starting in the 2013-2014 season.  \n\nFrom its inception in 1965, Simon Fraser competed in the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] to allow \"full ride\" scholarships. Canadian schools did not allow any form of scholarships until the late 1980s. SFU was forced to leave the NAIA in many sports due to schools in the Northwest US shifting to the NCAA. Until 2009, the NCAA limited membership to schools based in the U.S. Some Simon Fraser teams still competed in the U.S. before the school moved to the NCAA, and their men's wrestling program competed in the then-CIS and the NAIA. UBC has several of its programs (baseball, cross country, golf, outdoor track and field and softball) compete in the NAIA.\n\n==Awards==\n{{Main|Canada West University Hockey Awards}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.canadawest.org}}\n\n{{Canada West Universities Athletic Association}}\n{{U Sports football}}\n{{U Sports men's ice hockey}}\n{{U Sports women's ice hockey}}\n{{U Sports men's soccer}}\n{{U Sports women's soccer}}\n{{Soccer in Canada}}\n\n[[Category:U Sports]]\n[[Category:College athletics conferences in Canada]]\n[[Category:U Sports basketball]]\n[[Category:U Sports football]]\n[[Category:Sport in Western Canada]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Athletic Conference\n|name = Canada West\n|short_name = \n|established = 1972\n|logo = CanadaWestLogo.jpg\n|logo_size = 220px\n|association = [[U Sports]]\n|division = \n|subdivision =\n|members =17\n|sports = 12\n|mens = 9\n|womens = 11\n|region = [[Western Canada]]\n|former_names =Western Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union, Western Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Association\n|hq_state = \n|since = \n|website = {{URL|http://www.canadawest.org}}\n}}\n'''Canada West'''  is a regional membership association for universities in [[Western Canada]] which assists in co-ordinating competition between their university level athletic programs and providing contact information, schedules, results, and releases about those programs and events to the public and the media.  This is similar to what would be called a [[List of college athletic conferences|college athletic conference]] in the [[United States]]. Canada West is one of four such bodies that are members of the country's governing body for university athletics, [[U Sports]]. The other three regional associations coordinating university-level sports in Canada are [[Ontario University Athletics]] (OUA), [[Atlantic University Sport]] (AUS), and the [[Quebec Student Sport Federation]] (known by its French initialism of RSEQ).\n\n==History==\n\nThe Western Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union (WCIAU - later renamed Western Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Association) was formed in 1919-20 as the first recognized western-based post-secondary athletic organization in Canada, with the University of Manitoba winning the first-ever league championship, a men's hockey title, in 1920.\n\nIn the spring of 1972, the WCIAA was split into the Canada West Universities Athletic Association (CWUAA) and the Great Plains Athletic Association (GPAA - later renamed the Great Plains Athletic Conference).\n\nCWUAA consisted of schools spanning from Victoria to Saskatoon (Victoria, British Columbia, Calgary, Alberta, Lethbridge and Saskatchewan), while GPAA's member institutions stretched from Regina to Thunder Bay (Regina, Brandon, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Lakehead).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://canadawest.org/information/history|title=Canada West Universities Athletic Association|work=Canada West Universities Athletic Association|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Membership changes===\nIn 1985-86, Canada West offered playing privileges to men's hockey teams from the Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC) with other sports following over the years, culminating with the 2001-02 merger of basketball.\n\nSince 1999, 11 additional schools have joined the Canada West's six charter members. Trinity Western joined in 1999-00 and, in 2000-01, all schools from the Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC) except for Brandon were provided full membership in Canada West (Manitoba, Regina and Winnipeg). Brandon joined as an associate member at the time, until full membership was granted in 2005.\n\nSimon Fraser joined Canada West in 2000, followed by Thompson Rivers in 2005 and Fraser Valley in 2006.\n\nSimon Fraser withdrew from the conference as a member after the 2009-10 season, while both Thompson Rivers and Fraser Valley were awarded full membership in 2010 and, at the same time, UBC Okanagan received probationary membership.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.ok.ubc.ca/athrec/2010/09/01/1320/|title=UBC Okanagan joins Canada West; TRU & UFV full

On July 10, 2009 the NCAA accepted SFU's bid to join NCAA Division II in the 2011-2012 season. Canada West proceeded as a 13-team, 14 member conference for 2010-11, with the inclusion of UBC-Okanagan as a non-competing, probationary member for 2010-11, in time to begin competition (pending summer 2011 CIS approval) for the 2011-12 season. In May 2011 Mount Royal was awarded Canada West membership, effective Sept. 2011, with competition to begin in the 2012-13 season. In May 2013 MacEwan (Formally Grant MacEwan) approved as a 17th Canada West member starting in the 2013-2014 season.  \n\nFrom its inception in 1965, Simon Fraser competed in the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] to allow \"full ride\" scholarships. Canadian schools did not allow any form of scholarships until the late 1980s. SFU was forced to leave the NAIA in many sports due to schools in the Northwest US shifting to the NCAA. Until 2009, the NCAA limited membership to schools based in the U.S. Some Simon Fraser teams still competed in the U.S. before the school moved to the NCAA, and their men's wrestling program competed in the then-CIS and the NAIA. UBC has several of its programs (baseball, cross country, golf, outdoor track and field and softball) compete in the NAIA.\n\n==Awards==\n{{Main|Canada West University Hockey Awards}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.canadawest.org}}\n\n{{Canada West Universities Athletic Association}}\n{{U Sports football}}\n{{U Sports men's ice hockey}}\n{{U Sports women's ice hockey}}\n{{U Sports men's soccer}}\n{{U Sports women's soccer}}\n{{Soccer in Canada}}\n\n[[Category:U Sports]]\n[[Category:College athletics conferences in Canada]]\n[[Category:U Sports basketball]]\n[[Category:U Sports football]]\n[[Category:Sport in Western Canada]]\n", "name_user": "184.99.174.29", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_West_Universities_Athletic_Association"}

Other popular amulets and talismans used to ward off the evil eye include the [[hamsa]], while [[Italy]] (especially [[Southern Italy]]) employs a variety of other unique charms and gestures to defend against the evil eye, including the [[cornicello]], the [[cimaruta]], and the [[sign of the horns]].\n\n==History [[Classical antiquity]]. It is referenced by [[Hesiod]], [[Callimachus]], [[Plato]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Theocritus]], [[Plutarch]], [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Aulus Gellius]]. Peter Walcot's ''Envy and the Greeks'' (1978) listed more than one hundred works by these and other authors mentioning the evil eye.\n\n===Classical antiquity===\n[[File:Antiochia - House of the Evil Eye.jpg|thumb|Roman-era mosaic from Antioch depicting a plethora of devices against the evil eye]]\nClassical authors attempted both to describe and to explain the function of the evil eye. Plutarch's scientific explanation stated that the eyes were the chief, if not sole, source of the deadly rays that were supposed to spring up like poisoned darts from the inner recesses of a person possessing the evil eye. Plutarch treated the phenomenon of the evil eye as something seemingly inexplicable that is a source of wonder and cause of incredulity.{{efn|Plutarch, ''[[Moralia]]'', Book VII}} Pliny the Elder described the ability of certain African enchanters to have the \"power of fascination with the eyes and can even kill those on whom they fix their gaze\".{{efn|Pliny the Elderh, ''[[Natural History|Natural History (Pliny)]]'', VII.2}}\n\nThe idea of the evil eye appears in the poetry of [[Virgil]] in a conversation between the shepherds Menalcas and Damoetas.{{efn|Virgil, ''[[Eclogues]]'', III.1.103}} In the passage, Menalcas is lamenting the poor health of his stock: \"What eye is it that has fascinated my tender lambs?\".\n\n====Protection from the eye====\nThe belief in the evil eye during antiquity varied across different regions and periods. The evil eye was not feared with equal intensity in every corner of the Roman Empire. There were places in which people felt more conscious of the danger of the evil eye. In Roman times, not only were individuals considered to possess the power of the evil eye but whole tribes, especially those of Pontus and Scythia, were believed to be transmitters of the evil eye.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe [[fascinum|phallic charm]] called ''[[wikt:fascinum#Latin|fascinum]]'' in Latin, from the verb ''fascinare'', \"to cast a spell\" (the origin of the English word \"[[wikt:fascinate|fascinate]]\") is one example of an apotropaic object used against the evil eye.

Within the broadcasting industry it refers to when a presenter signals to the interviewee or co-presenter to stop talking due to a shortage of time.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Protective talismans and cures==\n[[File:WPVA-khamsa.svg|upright|thumb|left|The [[Hamsa]], a charm made to ward off the evil eye.]]\nAttempts to ward off the curse of the evil eye have resulted in a number of [[amulet|talismans]] in many cultures. As a class, they are called \"''apotropaic''\" (Greek for \"prophylactic\" / \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 or \"protective\", literally: \"turns away\") talismans, meaning that they turn away or turn back harm.\n\nDisks or balls, consisting of concentric blue and white circles (usually, from inside to outside, dark blue, light blue, white, and dark blue) representing an evil eye are common apotropaic talismans in West Asia, found on the [[prow]]s of Mediterranean [[boat]]s and elsewhere; in some forms of the folklore, the staring eyes are supposed to bend the malicious gaze back to the [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]].\n\nKnown as ''[[Evil eye in Turkish Culture|nazar]]'' ({{lang-tr|nazar boncu\u011fu}} or {{lang|tr|nazarl\u0131k}}), this talisman is most frequently seen in [[Turkey]], found in or on houses and vehicles or worn as beads.\n[[File:Hotamis Kilim.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of a 19th-century Anatolian [[kilim]], with rows of crosses (Turkish: Ha\u00e7) and scattered S-shaped hooks (Turkish: \u00c7engel), both to ward off the evil eye<ref name=Erbek/>]]\n\nA blue or green eye can also be found on some forms of the [[hamsa|hamsa hand]], an [[apotropaic]] hand-shaped talisman against the evil eye found in West Asia. The word hamsa, also spelled khamsa and hamesh, means \"five\" referring to the fingers of the hand. In [[Secular Jewish culture|Jewish culture]], the hamsa is called the [[hamsa|Hand of Miriam]]; in some Muslim cultures, the [[hamsa|Hand of Fatima]]. Though condemned as superstition by doctrinaire Muslims, it is almost exclusively among Muslims in the Near East and Mediterranean that the belief in envious looks containing destructive power or the talismanic power of a nazar to defend against them. To adherents of other faiths in the region, the nazar is an attractive decoration.\n\nA [[Kilim motifs|variety of motifs]] to ward off the evil eye are commonly woven into tribal [[kilim]] rugs. Such motifs include a cross (Turkish: Ha\u00e7) to divide the evil eye into four, a hook (Turkish: \u00c7engel) to destroy the evil eye, or a human eye (Turkish: G\u00f6z) to avert the evil gaze. The shape of a lucky [[amulet]] (Turkish: Muska; often, a triangular package containing a sacred verse) is often woven into kilims for the same reason.<ref name=Erbek>{{cite book |author=Erbek, G\u00fcran |title=Kilim Catalogue No. 1 |publisher =May Sel\u00e7uk A.

Edition=1st |date=1998}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n===In Greece===\nThe evil eye, known as {{lang|el|\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9}} (''mati''), \"eye\", as an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] visual device, is known to have been a fixture in Greece dating back to at least the 6th century BC, when it commonly appeared on drinking vessels.<ref>Merriam-Webster. ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions''. 2000, p. 69. {{ISBN|0877790442}}.</ref> In [[Greece]], the evil eye is cast away through the process of ''xematiasma'' ({{lang|el|\u03be\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1}}), whereby the \"healer\" silently recites a secret prayer passed over from an older relative of the opposite sex, usually a [[grandparent]]. Such prayers are revealed only under specific circumstances, as according to their customs those who reveal them indiscriminately lose their ability to cast off the evil eye. There are several regional versions of the prayer in question, a common one being: \"[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Holy Virgin]], Our Lady, if [insert name of the victim] is suffering of the evil eye, release him/her of it.\" [[Evil]] repeated three times. According to [[tradition|custom]], if one is indeed afflicted with the evil eye, both victim and \"healer\" then start yawning profusely. The \"healer\" then performs the sign of the cross three times, and emits spitting-like sounds in the air three times. A very similar ritual can be found in neighboring [[Republic of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]], as well as in [[Corsica]].\n\nAnother \"test\" used to check if the evil eye was cast is that of the [[oil]]: under normal conditions, [[olive oil]] floats in water, as it is less dense than water. The test of the oil is performed by placing one drop of olive oil in a glass of water, typically holy water.{{Citation needed|reason=this paragraph and the next two paragraphs appear to be original research|date=July 2017}} If the drop floats, the test concludes there is no evil eye involved. If the drop sinks, then it is asserted that the evil eye is cast indeed. Another form of the [[experiment|test]] is to place two drops of olive oil into a glass of water. If the drops remain separated, the test concludes there is no evil eye, but if they merge, there is. There is also a third form where in a plate full of water the \"healer\" places three or nine drops of oil. If the oil drops become larger and eventually dissolve in the water there is evil eye. If the drops remain separated from water in a form of a small circle there isn't. The first drops are the most important and the number of drops that dissolve in water indicate the strength of the evil eye.\n\nThere is another form of the \"test\" where the \"healer\" prepares a few cloves by piercing each one with a pin. Then she lights a candle and grabs a pinned clove with a pair of scissors. She then uses it to do the sign of the cross over the afflicted whilst the afflicted is asked to think of a person who may have given him the evil eye. Then the healer holds the clove over the flame. If the clove burns silently, there is no evil eye present; however, if the clove explodes or burns noisily, that means the person in the thoughts of the afflicted is the one who has cast the evil eye.{{Citation needed|reason=this paragraph, the preceding paragraph, and the following paragraph appear to be original research, or at least suspiciously informal|date=July 2017}} As the clove explodes, the evil eye is released from the afflicted. Cloves that burn with some noise are considered to be \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 - words - someone foul-mouthing you that you ought to be wary of. The burned cloves are extinguished into a glass of water and are later buried in the garden along with the pins as they are considered to be contaminated. Greek people will also ward off the evil eye by saying \u03c6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac\u03be\u03c9! which translates to \"I spit so that I won't give you the evil eye.\" Contrary to popular belief, the evil eye is not necessarily given by someone wishing you ill, but it stems from admiration. Since it is technically possible to give yourself the evil eye, it is advised to be humble.\n\nThe [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]] accepted the traditional belief in the evil eye, but attributed it to the [[Devil]] and [[envy]]. In Greek [[theology]], the evil eye or ''vaskania'' ({{lang|el|\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1}}) is considered harmful for the one whose envy inflicts it on others as well as for the sufferer. The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]] has an ancient prayer against vaskania from the ''Megan Hieron Synekdemon'' ({{lang|el|\u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd \u0399\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd \u03a3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03ba\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd}}) book of prayers.{{Citation needed|reason=This paragraph and the preceding two paragraphs appear to have original research or are at least suspiciously informal|date=July 2017}}\n\n<br />\n===In Islam===\n{{Expand section|Possible additional sayings exist.

Understanding of the evil eye varies by the level of education. Some perceive the use of black color to be useful in protecting from the evil eye. Others use \"[[taawiz]]\" to ward off the evil eye. Truck owners and other public transport vehicles may commonly be seen using a small black cloth on the bumpers to prevent the evil eye.<ref>Ghilzai, S.A., and Kanwal, A.

Cornicelli are usually carved out of red coral or made from gold or silver. The type of horn they are intended to copy is not a curled-over sheep horn or goat horn but rather like the twisted horn of an African [[Taurotragus|eland]] or a chili pepper.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Corno (Italian Horn Amulet)|url=http://www.luckymojo.com/corno.html|author=Lucky Mojo|access-date=9 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne idea that the [[ribaldry|ribald]] suggestions made by sexual [[symbol]]s distract the witch from the mental effort needed to successfully bestow the curse. Another is that since the effect of the eye was to dry up liquids, the drying of the phallus (resulting in male impotence) would be averted by seeking refuge in the moist female genitals. Among the ancient Romans and their cultural descendants in the Mediterranean nations, those who were not fortified with phallic charms had to make use of sexual [[gesture]]s to avoid the eye. Such gestures include scratching one's testicles (for men), as well as the ''[[mano cornuta]]'' gesture and [[List of gestures#Fig sign|the fig sign]]; a fist with the thumb pressed between the index and middle fingers, representing the phallus within the vagina. In addition to the phallic talismans, [[statue]]s of hands in these gestures, or covered with magical symbols, were carried by the Romans as talismans. In [[Latin America]], carvings of the fist with the thumb pressed between the index and middle fingers continue to be carried as good luck charms.\n[[File:Onda-ogat.jpg|thumb|right|Two handsigns ([[fig sign]] and [[Sign of the horns|horned sign]]) used in Italy against the evil eye (1914).]]\nThe wielder of the evil eye, the ''jettatore'', is described as having a striking facial appearance, high arching brows with a stark stare that leaps from his black eyes. He often has a reputation for clandestine involvement with dark powers and is the object of gossip about dealings in magic and other forbidden practices. Successful men having tremendous personal magnetism quickly gain notoriety as jettatori. [[Pope Pius IX]] was dreaded for his evil eye, and a whole cycle of stories about the disasters that happened in his wake were current in Rome during the latter decades of the 19th century. Public figures of every type, from poets to gangsters, have had their specialized abilities attributed to the power of their eyes.<ref>Maloney, Clarence. ''The Evil Eye''.

Another preventive measure is allowing admirers to touch the infant or child; in a similar manner, a person wearing an item of clothing that might induce envy may suggest to others that they touch it or some other way dispel envy.\n\nOne traditional cure in rural Mexico involves a ''[[curandero]]'' (folk healer) sweeping a raw chicken egg over the body of a victim to absorb the power of the person with the evil eye. The egg is later broken into a glass with water and placed under the bed of the patient near the head. Sometimes it is checked immediately because the egg appears as if it has been cooked. When this happens it means that the patient did have Mal De Ojo. Somehow the Mal De Ojo has transferred to the egg and the patient immediately gets well. (Fever, pain and diarrhea, nausea/vomiting goes away instantly) In the traditional Hispanic culture of the Southwestern United States and some parts of Mexico, the egg may be passed over the patient in a cross-shaped pattern all over the body, while reciting ''The Lord's Prayer''. The egg is also placed in a glass with water, under the bed and near the head, sometimes it is examined right away or in the morning and if the egg looks like it has been cooked then it means that they did have Mal de Ojo and the patient will start feeling better. Sometimes if the patient starts getting ill and someone knows that they had stared at the patient, usually a child, if the person who stared goes to the child and touches them, the child's illness goes away immediately so the Mal De Ojo energy is released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/medical/med_1.htm |title=Medical Anthropology: Explanations of Illness |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817130521/http://anthro.palomar.edu/medical/med_1.htm |archivedate=2012-08-17 }}</ref>\n\nIn some parts of [[South America]] the act of ''ojear'', which could be translated as ''to give someone the evil eye'', is an involuntary act. Someone may ''ojear'' babies, animals and inanimate objects just by staring and admiring them. This may produce illness, discomfort or possibly death on babies or animals and failures on inanimate objects like cars or houses. It's a common belief that since this is an involuntary act made by people with the ''heavy look'', the proper way of protection is by attaching a red ribbon to the animal, baby or object, in order to attract the gaze to the ribbon rather than to the object intended to be protected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.revistatabularasa.org/numero_dos/florez.pdf |title=El ''Mal de Ojo'' de la Etnograf\u00eda Cl\u00e1sica y ''La Limpia'' Posmoderna |author=Fl\u00f3rez, Franz |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727213519/http://www.revistatabularasa.org/numero_dos/florez.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}</ref>\n\n====Brazil====\nBrazilians generally will associate ''mal-olhado'', ''mau-olhado'' (\"act of giving a bad look\") or ''olho gordo'' (\"fat eye\" i.e. \"gluttonous eye\") with envy or jealousy on domestic and garden plants (that, after months or years of health and beauty, will suddenly weaken, wither and die, with no apparent signs of pest, after the visitation of a certain friend or relative), attractive hair and less often economic or romantic success and family harmony.\n\nUnlike in most cultures ''mal-olhado'' is not seen to be something that risks young babies. \"Pagans\" or non-baptized children are instead assumed to be at risk from ''bruxas'' (witches), that have malignant intention themselves rather than just ''mal-olhado''. It probably reflects the Galician folktales about the ''[[meiga]]s'' or Portuguese magas, (witches), as Colonial Brazil was primarily settled by [[Portuguese people]], in numbers greater than all Europeans to settle pre-independence United States. Those ''bruxas'' are interpreted to have taken the form of moths, often very dark, that disturb children at night and take away their energy. For that reason, Christian Brazilians often have amulets in the form of crucifixes around, beside or inside beds where children sleep.\n\nNevertheless, older children, especially boys, that fulfill the cultural ideals of behaving extremely well (for example, having no problems whatsoever in eating well a great variety of foods, being obedient and respectful toward adults, kind, polite, studious, and demonstrating no bad blood with other children or their siblings) who unexpectedly turn into problematic adolescents or adults (for example lacking good health habits, extreme laziness or lacking motivation towards their life goals, having eating disorders, or being prone to delinquency), are said to have been victims of ''mal-olhado'' coming from parents of children whose behavior was not as admirable.\n\nAmulets that protect against ''mal-olhado'' tend to be generally resistant, mildly to strongly toxic and dark plants in specific and strategic places of a garden or the entry to a house. Those include ''comigo-ningu\u00e9m-pode'' (\"against-me-nobody-cans\"), ''[[Dieffenbachia]]'' (the dumbcane), ''espada-de-s\u00e3o-jorge'' (\"St. George's sword\"), ''[[Sansevieria trifasciata]]'' (the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue) and ''guin\u00e9'' (\"Guinea\"), among [[:pt:Petiveria tetrandra|various other names]], ''[[Petiveria alliacea]]'' (the guinea henweed). For those lacking in space or wanting to \"sanitize\" specific places, they may all be planted together in a single ''sete ervas'' (\"seven [lucky] herbs\") pot, that will also include ''arruda'' ([[Ruta graveolens|common rue]]), ''pimenteira'' ([[Capsicum annuum]]), ''manjeric\u00e3o'' ([[basil]]) and ''alecrim'' ([[rosemary]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vidaeestilo.terra.com.br/esoterico/interna/0,,OI4880508-EI14322,00-Conheca+o+poder+e+a+protecao+das+sete+ervas.html |title=Conhe\u00e7a o poder e a prote\u00e7\u00e3o das sete ervas |author=Guizetti, Franco |language= pt |accessdate=Jan 19, 2012}}</ref> (Though the last four ones should not be used for their common culinary purposes by humans.)\nOther popular amulets against evil eye include: the use of mirrors, on the outside of your home's front door, or also inside your home facing your front door; an elephant figurine with its back to the front door; and coarse salt, placed in specific places at home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://revista.zap.com.br/imoveis/proteja-sua-casa-do-mau-olhado/|title=Proteja sua casa do mau olhado|last=Caires|first=Olivia|language= Portuguese|accessdate=February 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Mexico====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\nMal de ojo (Mal: Illness - de ojo: Of eye. \"To be made ill by an eye's gaze\") often occurs without the dimension of envy, but insofar as envy is a part of ojo, it is a variant of this underlying sense of insecurity and relative vulnerability to powerful, hostile forces in the environment. In her study of medical attitudes in the Santa Clara Valley of California, Margaret Clark arrives at essentially the same conclusion: \"Among the Spanish-speaking folk of Sal si Puedes, the patient is regarded as a passive and innocent victim of malevolent forces in his environment. These forces may be witches, evil spirits, the consequences of poverty, or virulent bacteria that invade his body. The scapegoat may be a visiting social worker who unwittingly 'cast the evil eye'&nbsp;... Mexican folk concepts of disease are based in part on the notion that people can be victimized by the careless or malicious behavior of others\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nAnother aspect of the mal ojo syndrome in Ixtepeji is a disturbance of the hot-cold equilibrium in the victim. According to folk belief, the bad effects of an attack result from the \"hot\" force of the aggressor entering the child's body and throwing it out of balance. Currier has shown how the Mexican hot-cold system is an unconscious folk model of social relations upon which social anxieties are projected. According to Currier, \"the nature of Mexican peasant society is such that each individual must continuously attempt to achieve a balance between two opposing social forces: the tendency toward intimacy and that toward withdrawal. [It is therefore proposed] that the individual's continuous preoccupation with achieving a balance between 'heat' and 'cold' is a way of reenacting, in symbolic terms, a fundamental activity in social relations.\"<ref>Maloney, Clarence.

The jealousy can be disguised into a positive aspect such as compliments or admiration. Mal de Ojo is considered a curse and illness. It is believed that without proper protection, bad luck, injury, and illness are expected to follow. Mal de Ojo impact is believed to affect speech, relationships, work, family and most notably, health. Since Mal de Ojo centers around envy and compliments, it creates fear of interacting with people that are outside of their culture. Indirect harm could be brought to them or their family. When it comes to children, they are considered to be more susceptible to Mal de Ojo and it is believed that it can weaken them, leading to illness. As a child grows every effort is taken to protect them. When diagnosing Mal de Ojo, it is important to notice the symptoms. Physical symptoms can include: loss of appetite, body weakness, stomach ache, insomnia, fever, nausea, eye infections, lack of energy, and temperament.\n\nEnvironmental symptoms can include financial, family, and personal problems as simple as a car breaking down. It is important for those who believe to be aware of anything that has gone wrong because it may be linked to Mal de Ojo. Puerto Ricans are protected through the use of  Azabache bracelets. Mal de Ojo can also be avoided by touching an infant when giving admiration. The most common practice of protection in Puerto Rico is the use of Azabache bracelets. These bracelets traditionally have a black or red coral amulet attached. The amulet is in the shape of a fist with a protruding index finger knuckle. \n[[File:Azabache Bracelet.png|thumb|Azabache bracelet charm with a first and protruding index finger knuckle]]\nEggs are the most common method to cure Mal De Ojo. The red string and oils also used are more common in other cultures but still used in Puerto Rico depending on the Healer, or the person who is believed to have the ability to cure those who have been targeted. Ultimately, the act of giving someone the \"Evil Eye\" is a rather simple process and is practiced throughout the world.\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main|Nazar Battu}}\nIn the northern states of India, like the Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, the evil eye is called \"Drishti\" (meaning gaze or vision) or more commonly as ''Buri Nazar''. A charm bracelet, tattoo or other object ([[Nazar battu]]), or a slogan ([[Chashme Baddoor (slogan)]]), may be used to ward-off the evil eye. Some truck owners write the slogan to ward off the evil eye: \"buri nazar wale tera muh kala\" (\"O evil-eyed one, may your face turn black\").\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, people call it as 'Disti' or 'Drusti', while people of Tamil Nadu call it 'drishti' or 'kannu' (translated, means evil eye). To remove ''Drishti'', people follow several methods based on their culture/area. Items often used are either rock salt, red chilies, white pumpkins, oiled cloth, or lemons coated with [[kumkuma]]. People remove ''Drishti'' by rotating any one of these items and around the affected person. The person who removes it will then burn the item, or discard it in a place where others are not likely to stamp on these items. People hang pictures of fierce and scary ogres in their homes or vehicles, to ward off the evil eye.<ref>{{cite website |author1=Kannan, Shalini | title=Surprises And Superstitions In Rural Tamil Nadu | url=https://milaap.org/stories/surprises-and-superstitions-in-rural-tamil-nadu | year= 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn India, babies and newborn infants will usually have their eye adorned with kajal, or eyeliner. This would be black, as it is believed in India that black wards off the evil eye or any evil auras. The umbilical cord of babies is often preserved and cast into a metal pendant, and tied to a black string \u2014 babies can wear this as a chain, bracelet or belt \u2014 the belief, once more, is that this protects the infant from ''drishti''. This is a practice that has been followed right from historical times. People usually remove ''drishti'' on full-moon or new-moon days, since these days are considered to be auspicious in India. \n\nIndians often leave small patches of rock salt outside their homes, and hang arrangements of green chilies, neem leaves, and lemons on their stoop. The belief is that this will ward away the evil eye cast on families by detractors. <ref name=\"JackStephen2013\">{{cite book |author1=Amariglio, Jack |author2=Cullenberg, Stephen E |author3=Ruccio, David F | title=Post-Modernism, Economics and Knowledge | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-LqpYBnDOkC&pg=PA217 |year= 2013 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-1-134-83668-0 | pages=217\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn 1946, the American [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] [[Henri Gamache]] published a text called ''Terrors of the Evil Eye Exposed!''

So does envy. Since ancient times such maledictions have been collectively called the evil eye. According to the book ''The Evil Eye'' by folklorist [[Alan Dundes]],<ref>Dundes, Alan (ed.) (1992) ''The Evil Eye: A Casebook'' [[University of Wisconsin Press]], Madison, Wisconsin, {{ISBN|0-299-13334-6}}; originally published in 1981 by Garland Publishing, New York</ref> the belief's premise is that an individual can cause harm simply by looking at another's person or property. However, protection is easy to come by with talismans that can be worn, carried, or hung in homes, most often incorporating the contours of a human eye. In Aegean countries, people with light-colored eyes are thought to be particularly powerful, and amulets in Greece and Turkey are usually blue orbs. Indians and Jews use charms with palm-forward hands with an eye in the center; Italians employ horns, phallic shapes meant to distract spell casters.<ref>Rizzo, Johnna (April 2013) ''National Geographic Magazine''</ref>\n\n==Names in various languages==\nIn most languages, the name translates literally into [[English language|English]] as \"bad eye\", \"evil eye\", \"evil look\", or just \"the Eye\".

It is referenced by [[Hesiod]], [[Callimachus]], [[Plato]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Theocritus]], [[Plutarch]], [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Aulus Gellius]]. Peter Walcot's ''Envy and the Greeks'' (1978) listed more than one hundred works by these and other authors mentioning the evil eye.\n\n===Classical antiquity===\n[[File:Antiochia - House of the Evil Eye.jpg|thumb|Roman-era mosaic from Antioch depicting a plethora of devices against the evil eye]]\nClassical authors attempted both to describe and to explain the function of the evil eye. Plutarch's scientific explanation stated that the eyes were the chief, if not sole, source of the deadly rays that were supposed to spring up like poisoned darts from the inner recesses of a person possessing the evil eye. Plutarch treated the phenomenon of the evil eye as something seemingly inexplicable that is a source of wonder and cause of incredulity.{{efn|Plutarch, ''[[Moralia]]'', Book VII}} Pliny the Elder described the ability of certain African enchanters to have the \"power of fascination with the eyes and can even kill those on whom they fix their gaze\".{{efn|Pliny the Elderh, ''[[Natural History|Natural History (Pliny)]]'', VII.2}}\n\nThe idea of the evil eye appears in the poetry of [[Virgil]] in a conversation between the shepherds Menalcas and Damoetas.{{efn|Virgil, ''[[Eclogues]]'', III.1.103}} In the passage, Menalcas is lamenting the poor health of his stock: \"What eye is it that has fascinated my tender lambs?\".\n\n====Protection from the eye====\nThe belief in the evil eye during antiquity varied across different regions and periods. The evil eye was not feared with equal intensity in every corner of the Roman Empire. There were places in which people felt more conscious of the danger of the evil eye. In Roman times, not only were individuals considered to possess the power of the evil eye but whole tribes, especially those of Pontus and Scythia, were believed to be transmitters of the evil eye.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe [[fascinum|phallic charm]] called ''[[wikt:fascinum#Latin|fascinum]]'' in Latin, from the verb ''fascinare'', \"to cast a spell\" (the origin of the English word \"[[wikt:fascinate|fascinate]]\") is one example of an apotropaic object used against the evil eye.

As a class, they are called \"''apotropaic''\" (Greek for \"prophylactic\" / \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 or \"protective\", literally: \"turns away\") talismans, meaning that they turn away or turn back harm.\n\nDisks or balls, consisting of concentric blue and white circles (usually, from inside to outside, dark blue, light blue, white, and dark blue) representing an evil eye are common apotropaic talismans in West Asia, found on the [[prow]]s of Mediterranean [[boat]]s and elsewhere; in some forms of the folklore, the staring eyes are supposed to bend the malicious gaze back to the [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]].\n\nKnown as ''[[Evil eye in Turkish Culture|nazar]]'' ({{lang-tr|nazar boncu\u011fu}} or {{lang|tr|nazarl\u0131k}}), this talisman is most frequently seen in [[Turkey]], found in or on houses and vehicles or worn as beads.\n[[File:Hotamis Kilim.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of a 19th-century Anatolian [[kilim]], with rows of crosses (Turkish: Ha\u00e7) and scattered S-shaped hooks (Turkish: \u00c7engel), both to ward off the evil eye<ref name=Erbek/>]]\n\nA blue or green eye can also be found on some forms of the [[hamsa|hamsa hand]], an [[apotropaic]] hand-shaped talisman against the evil eye found in West Asia. The word hamsa, also spelled khamsa and hamesh, means \"five\" referring to the fingers of the hand. In [[Secular Jewish culture|Jewish culture]], the hamsa is called the [[hamsa|Hand of Miriam]]; in some Muslim cultures, the [[hamsa|Hand of Fatima]]. Though condemned as superstition by doctrinaire Muslims, it is almost exclusively among Muslims in the Near East and Mediterranean that the belief in envious looks containing destructive power or the talismanic power of a nazar to defend against them. To adherents of other faiths in the region, the nazar is an attractive decoration.\n\nA [[Kilim motifs|variety of motifs]] to ward off the evil eye are commonly woven into tribal [[kilim]] rugs. Such motifs include a cross (Turkish: Ha\u00e7) to divide the evil eye into four, a hook (Turkish: \u00c7engel) to destroy the evil eye, or a human eye (Turkish: G\u00f6z) to avert the evil gaze. The shape of a lucky [[amulet]] (Turkish: Muska; often, a triangular package containing a sacred verse) is often woven into kilims for the same reason.<ref name=Erbek>{{cite book |author=Erbek, G\u00fcran |title=Kilim Catalogue No. 1 |publisher =May Sel\u00e7uk A.

''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions''. 2000, p. 69. {{ISBN|0877790442}}.</ref> In [[Greece]], the evil eye is cast away through the process of ''xematiasma'' ({{lang|el|\u03be\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1}}), whereby the \"healer\" silently recites a secret prayer passed over from an older relative of the opposite sex, usually a [[grandparent]]. Such prayers are revealed only under specific circumstances, as according to their customs those who reveal them indiscriminately lose their ability to cast off the evil eye. There are several regional versions of the prayer in question, a common one being: \"[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Holy Virgin]], Our Lady, if [insert name of the victim] is suffering of the evil eye, release him/her of it.\" [[Evil]] repeated three times. According to [[tradition|custom]], if one is indeed afflicted with the evil eye, both victim and \"healer\" then start yawning profusely. The \"healer\" then performs the sign of the cross three times, and emits spitting-like sounds in the air three times. A very similar ritual can be found in neighboring [[Republic of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]], as well as in [[Corsica]].\n\nAnother \"test\" used to check if the evil eye was cast is that of the [[oil]]: under normal conditions, [[olive oil]] floats in water, as it is less dense than water. The test of the oil is performed by placing one drop of olive oil in a glass of water, typically holy water.{{Citation needed|reason=this paragraph and the next two paragraphs appear to be original research|date=July 2017}} If the drop floats, the test concludes there is no evil eye involved. If the drop sinks, then it is asserted that the evil eye is cast indeed. Another form of the [[experiment|test]] is to place two drops of olive oil into a glass of water. If the drops remain separated, the test concludes there is no evil eye, but if they merge, there is. There is also a third form where in a plate full of water the \"healer\" places three or nine drops of oil. If the oil drops become larger and eventually dissolve in the water there is evil eye. If the drops remain separated from water in a form of a small circle there isn't. The first drops are the most important and the number of drops that dissolve in water indicate the strength of the evil eye.\n\nThere is another form of the \"test\" where the \"healer\" prepares a few cloves by piercing each one with a pin. Then she lights a candle and grabs a pinned clove with a pair of scissors. She then uses it to do the sign of the cross over the afflicted whilst the afflicted is asked to think of a person who may have given him the evil eye. Then the healer holds the clove over the flame. If the clove burns silently, there is no evil eye present; however, if the clove explodes or burns noisily, that means the person in the thoughts of the afflicted is the one who has cast the evil eye.{{Citation needed|reason=this paragraph, the preceding paragraph, and the following paragraph appear to be original research, or at least suspiciously informal|date=July 2017}} As the clove explodes, the evil eye is released from the afflicted. Cloves that burn with some noise are considered to be \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 - words - someone foul-mouthing you that you ought to be wary of. The burned cloves are extinguished into a glass of water and are later buried in the garden along with the pins as they are considered to be contaminated. Greek people will also ward off the evil eye by saying \u03c6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac\u03be\u03c9! which translates to \"I spit so that I won't give you the evil eye.\" Contrary to popular belief, the evil eye is not necessarily given by someone wishing you ill, but it stems from admiration. Since it is technically possible to give yourself the evil eye, it is advised to be humble.\n\nThe [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]] accepted the traditional belief in the evil eye, but attributed it to the [[Devil]] and [[envy]]. In Greek [[theology]], the evil eye or ''vaskania'' ({{lang|el|\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1}}) is considered harmful for the one whose envy inflicts it on others as well as for the sufferer. The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]] has an ancient prayer against vaskania from the ''Megan Hieron Synekdemon'' ({{lang|el|\u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd \u0399\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd \u03a3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03ba\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd}}) book of prayers.{{Citation needed|reason=This paragraph and the preceding two paragraphs appear to have original research or are at least suspiciously informal|date=July 2017}}\n\n<br />\n===In Islam===\n{{Expand section|Possible additional sayings exist.

Among the ancient Romans and their cultural descendants in the Mediterranean nations, those who were not fortified with phallic charms had to make use of sexual [[gesture]]s to avoid the eye. Such gestures include scratching one's testicles (for men), as well as the ''[[mano cornuta]]'' gesture and [[List of gestures#Fig sign|the fig sign]]; a fist with the thumb pressed between the index and middle fingers, representing the phallus within the vagina.

They are said to protect fishermen from storms and malicious intentions.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/il-qoxra-tradizzjona-traa-traditional-seacraft-gradually-on-the-declineditional-seacraft-gradually-on-the-declineali-li-kulma-tmur-qed-tonqos/}}</ref>\n\n===Spain and Latin America===\nThe evil eye or 'Mal de Ojo' has been deeply embedded in Spanish popular culture throughout its history and Spain is the origin of this superstition in Latin America.\n\nIn [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], infants are considered at special risk for the evil eye (see ''mal de ojo'', above) and are often given an amulet bracelet as protection, typically with an eye-like spot painted on the amulet. Another preventive measure is allowing admirers to touch the infant or child; in a similar manner, a person wearing an item of clothing that might induce envy may suggest to others that they touch it or some other way dispel envy.\n\nOne traditional cure in rural Mexico involves a ''[[curandero]]'' (folk healer) sweeping a raw chicken egg over the body of a victim to absorb the power of the person with the evil eye. The egg is later broken into a glass with water and placed under the bed of the patient near the head. Sometimes it is checked immediately because the egg appears as if it has been cooked. When this happens it means that the patient did have Mal De Ojo. Somehow the Mal De Ojo has transferred to the egg and the patient immediately gets well. (Fever, pain and diarrhea, nausea/vomiting goes away instantly) In the traditional Hispanic culture of the Southwestern United States and some parts of Mexico, the egg may be passed over the patient in a cross-shaped pattern all over the body, while reciting ''The Lord's Prayer''. The egg is also placed in a glass with water, under the bed and near the head, sometimes it is examined right away or in the morning and if the egg looks like it has been cooked then it means that they did have Mal de Ojo and the patient will start feeling better. Sometimes if the patient starts getting ill and someone knows that they had stared at the patient, usually a child, if the person who stared goes to the child and touches them, the child's illness goes away immediately so the Mal De Ojo energy is released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/medical/med_1.htm |title=Medical Anthropology: Explanations of Illness |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817130521/http://anthro.palomar.edu/medical/med_1.htm |archivedate=2012-08-17 }}</ref>\n\nIn some parts of [[South America]] the act of ''ojear'', which could be translated as ''to give someone the evil eye'', is an involuntary act. Someone may ''ojear'' babies, animals and inanimate objects just by staring and admiring them. This may produce illness, discomfort or possibly death on babies or animals and failures on inanimate objects like cars or houses. It's a common belief that since this is an involuntary act made by people with the ''heavy look'', the proper way of protection is by attaching a red ribbon to the animal, baby or object, in order to attract the gaze to the ribbon rather than to the object intended to be protected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.revistatabularasa.org/numero_dos/florez.pdf |title=El ''Mal de Ojo'' de la Etnograf\u00eda Cl\u00e1sica y ''La Limpia'' Posmoderna |author=Fl\u00f3rez, Franz |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727213519/http://www.revistatabularasa.org/numero_dos/florez.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}</ref>\n\n====Brazil====\nBrazilians generally will associate ''mal-olhado'', ''mau-olhado'' (\"act of giving a bad look\") or ''olho gordo'' (\"fat eye\" i.e. \"gluttonous eye\") with envy or jealousy on domestic and garden plants (that, after months or years of health and beauty, will suddenly weaken, wither and die, with no apparent signs of pest, after the visitation of a certain friend or relative), attractive hair and less often economic or romantic success and family harmony.\n\nUnlike in most cultures ''mal-olhado'' is not seen to be something that risks young babies. \"Pagans\" or non-baptized children are instead assumed to be at risk from ''bruxas'' (witches), that have malignant intention themselves rather than just ''mal-olhado''. It probably reflects the Galician folktales about the ''[[meiga]]s'' or Portuguese magas, (witches), as Colonial Brazil was primarily settled by [[Portuguese people]], in numbers greater than all Europeans to settle pre-independence United States. Those ''bruxas'' are interpreted to have taken the form of moths, often very dark, that disturb children at night and take away their energy. For that reason, Christian Brazilians often have amulets in the form of crucifixes around, beside or inside beds where children sleep.\n\nNevertheless, older children, especially boys, that fulfill the cultural ideals of behaving extremely well (for example, having no problems whatsoever in eating well a great variety of foods, being obedient and respectful toward adults, kind, polite, studious, and demonstrating no bad blood with other children or their siblings) who unexpectedly turn into problematic adolescents or adults (for example lacking good health habits, extreme laziness or lacking motivation towards their life goals, having eating disorders, or being prone to delinquency), are said to have been victims of ''mal-olhado'' coming from parents of children whose behavior was not as admirable.\n\nAmulets that protect against ''mal-olhado'' tend to be generally resistant, mildly to strongly toxic and dark plants in specific and strategic places of a garden or the entry to a house. Those include ''comigo-ningu\u00e9m-pode'' (\"against-me-nobody-cans\"), ''[[Dieffenbachia]]'' (the dumbcane), ''espada-de-s\u00e3o-jorge'' (\"St. George's sword\"), ''[[Sansevieria trifasciata]]'' (the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue) and ''guin\u00e9'' (\"Guinea\"), among [[:pt:Petiveria tetrandra|various other names]], ''[[Petiveria alliacea]]'' (the guinea henweed). For those lacking in space or wanting to \"sanitize\" specific places, they may all be planted together in a single ''sete ervas'' (\"seven [lucky] herbs\") pot, that will also include ''arruda'' ([[Ruta graveolens|common rue]]), ''pimenteira'' ([[Capsicum annuum]]), ''manjeric\u00e3o'' ([[basil]]) and ''alecrim'' ([[rosemary]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vidaeestilo.terra.com.br/esoterico/interna/0,,OI4880508-EI14322,00-Conheca+o+poder+e+a+protecao+das+sete+ervas.html |title=Conhe\u00e7a o poder e a prote\u00e7\u00e3o das sete ervas |author=Guizetti, Franco |language= pt |accessdate=Jan 19, 2012}}</ref> (Though the last four ones should not be used for their common culinary purposes by humans.)\nOther popular amulets against evil eye include: the use of mirrors, on the outside of your home's front door, or also inside your home facing your front door; an elephant figurine with its back to the front door; and coarse salt, placed in specific places at home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://revista.zap.com.br/imoveis/proteja-sua-casa-do-mau-olhado/|title=Proteja sua casa do mau olhado|last=Caires|first=Olivia|language= Portuguese|accessdate=February 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Mexico====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\nMal de ojo (Mal: Illness - de ojo: Of eye. \"To be made ill by an eye's gaze\") often occurs without the dimension of envy, but insofar as envy is a part of ojo, it is a variant of this underlying sense of insecurity and relative vulnerability to powerful, hostile forces in the environment. In her study of medical attitudes in the Santa Clara Valley of California, Margaret Clark arrives at essentially the same conclusion: \"Among the Spanish-speaking folk of Sal si Puedes, the patient is regarded as a passive and innocent victim of malevolent forces in his environment. These forces may be witches, evil spirits, the consequences of poverty, or virulent bacteria that invade his body. The scapegoat may be a visiting social worker who unwittingly 'cast the evil eye'&nbsp;... Mexican folk concepts of disease are based in part on the notion that people can be victimized by the careless or malicious behavior of others\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nAnother aspect of the mal ojo syndrome in Ixtepeji is a disturbance of the hot-cold equilibrium in the victim. According to folk belief, the bad effects of an attack result from the \"hot\" force of the aggressor entering the child's body and throwing it out of balance. Currier has shown how the Mexican hot-cold system is an unconscious folk model of social relations upon which social anxieties are projected. According to Currier, \"the nature of Mexican peasant society is such that each individual must continuously attempt to achieve a balance between two opposing social forces: the tendency toward intimacy and that toward withdrawal. [It is therefore proposed] that the individual's continuous preoccupation with achieving a balance between 'heat' and 'cold' is a way of reenacting, in symbolic terms, a fundamental activity in social relations.\"<ref>Maloney, Clarence.

The jealousy can be disguised into a positive aspect such as compliments or admiration. Mal de Ojo is considered a curse and illness. It is believed that without proper protection, bad luck, injury, and illness are expected to follow. Mal de Ojo impact is believed to affect speech, relationships, work, family and most notably, health. Since Mal de Ojo centers around envy and compliments, it creates fear of interacting with people that are outside of their culture. Indirect harm could be brought to them or their family. When it comes to children, they are considered to be more susceptible to Mal de Ojo and it is believed that it can weaken them, leading to illness. As a child grows every effort is taken to protect them. When diagnosing Mal de Ojo, it is important to notice the symptoms. Physical symptoms can include: loss of appetite, body weakness, stomach ache, insomnia, fever, nausea, eye infections, lack of energy, and temperament.\n\nEnvironmental symptoms can include financial, family, and personal problems as simple as a car breaking down. It is important for those who believe to be aware of anything that has gone wrong because it may be linked to Mal de Ojo. Puerto Ricans are protected through the use of  Azabache bracelets. Mal de Ojo can also be avoided by touching an infant when giving admiration. The most common practice of protection in Puerto Rico is the use of Azabache bracelets. These bracelets traditionally have a black or red coral amulet attached. The amulet is in the shape of a fist with a protruding index finger knuckle. \n[[File:Azabache Bracelet.png|thumb|Azabache bracelet charm with a first and protruding index finger knuckle]]\nEggs are the most common method to cure Mal De Ojo. The red string and oils also used are more common in other cultures but still used in Puerto Rico depending on the Healer, or the person who is believed to have the ability to cure those who have been targeted. Ultimately, the act of giving someone the \"Evil Eye\" is a rather simple process and is practiced throughout the world.\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main|Nazar Battu}}\nIn the northern states of India, like the Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, the evil eye is called \"Drishti\" (meaning gaze or vision) or more commonly as ''Buri Nazar''. A charm bracelet, tattoo or other object ([[Nazar battu]]), or a slogan ([[Chashme Baddoor (slogan)]]), may be used to ward-off the evil eye. Some truck owners write the slogan to ward off the evil eye: \"buri nazar wale tera muh kala\" (\"O evil-eyed one, may your face turn black\").\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, people call it as 'Disti' or 'Drusti', while people of Tamil Nadu call it 'drishti' or 'kannu' (translated, means evil eye). To remove ''Drishti'', people follow several methods based on their culture/area. Items often used are either rock salt, red chilies, white pumpkins, oiled cloth, or lemons coated with [[kumkuma]]. People remove ''Drishti'' by rotating any one of these items and around the affected person. The person who removes it will then burn the item, or discard it in a place where others are not likely to stamp on these items. People hang pictures of fierce and scary ogres in their homes or vehicles, to ward off the evil eye.<ref>{{cite website |author1=Kannan, Shalini | title=Surprises And Superstitions In Rural Tamil Nadu | url=https://milaap.org/stories/surprises-and-superstitions-in-rural-tamil-nadu | year= 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn India, babies and newborn infants will usually have their eye adorned with kajal, or eyeliner. This would be black, as it is believed in India that black wards off the evil eye or any evil auras. The umbilical cord of babies is often preserved and cast into a metal pendant, and tied to a black string \u2014 babies can wear this as a chain, bracelet or belt \u2014 the belief, once more, is that this protects the infant from ''drishti''. This is a practice that has been followed right from historical times. People usually remove ''drishti'' on full-moon or new-moon days, since these days are considered to be auspicious in India. \n\nIndians often leave small patches of rock salt outside their homes, and hang arrangements of green chilies, neem leaves, and lemons on their stoop. The belief is that this will ward away the evil eye cast on families by detractors. <ref name=\"JackStephen2013\">{{cite book |author1=Amariglio, Jack |author2=Cullenberg, Stephen E |author3=Ruccio, David F | title=Post-Modernism, Economics and Knowledge | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-LqpYBnDOkC&pg=PA217 |year= 2013 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-1-134-83668-0 | pages=217\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn 1946, the American [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] [[Henri Gamache]] published a text called ''Terrors of the Evil Eye Exposed!''

So does envy. Since ancient times such maledictions have been collectively called the evil eye. According to the book ''The Evil Eye'' by folklorist [[Alan Dundes]],<ref>Dundes, Alan (ed.) (1992) ''The Evil Eye: A Casebook'' [[University of Wisconsin Press]], Madison, Wisconsin, {{ISBN|0-299-13334-6}}; originally published in 1981 by Garland Publishing, New York</ref> the belief's premise is that an individual can cause harm simply by looking at another's person or property. However, protection is easy to come by with talismans that can be worn, carried, or hung in homes, most often incorporating the contours of a human eye. In Aegean countries, people with light-colored eyes are thought to be particularly powerful, and amulets in Greece and Turkey are usually blue orbs. Indians and Jews use charms with palm-forward hands with an eye in the center; Italians employ horns, phallic shapes meant to distract spell casters.<ref>Rizzo, Johnna (April 2013) ''National Geographic Magazine''</ref>\n\n==Names in various languages==\nIn most languages, the name translates literally into [[English language|English]] as \"bad eye\", \"evil eye\", \"evil look\", or just \"the Eye\".
