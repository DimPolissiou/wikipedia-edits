A recurring cast member during the first season, Cassidy is a young and inexperienced detective with the [[New York Police Department]]'s [[Special Victims Unit]], and the original partner of [[John Munch]] ([[Richard Belzer]]). The stress of the Special Victims Unit is too much for Cassidy, and he transfers to the Narcotics unit in the middle of the season. Cassidy later returns in the [[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)|13th-season]] finale working undercover for a [[pimp]] the SVU detectives are investigating. Winters had previously worked with creator [[Dick Wolf]], but he was offered a role on ''SVU'' through Belzer, though the role proved to be temporary due to Winters' commitment to ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''. As Winters only remained with the series for 13 episodes, his character never had much of a chance to develop. Winters wanted to return to the show for a long time, though, and felt the time was right during the [[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)|13th-season]] finale. Critics were generally negative about Cassidy during the character's initial tenure on the show, but some were glad to see his return in \"[[Rhodium Nights]]\".\n\n==Character biography==\n\nEven though Brian Cassidy is a dedicated member of the Special Victims Unit, he lacks the language to describe sex crimes and the emotional maturity to deal with them.<ref name=\"Green157\">{{Harvnb|Green|p=157}}</ref> He views his partner, [[John Munch]] ([[Richard Belzer]]), as a mentor.\n\nCassidy has a drunken [[one-night stand]] with fellow SVU Detective [[Olivia Benson]] ([[Mariska Hargitay]]) but wants to pursue a relationship with her. She turns him down, citing a policy of not having relationships with co-workers.<ref name=\"Green157\" /><ref>{{cite episode |title=Closure |series=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |serieslink=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=January 7, 2000 |season=1|number=10}}</ref> Years later, Benson expresses regret at the way she handled the situation.<ref name=\"AboveSuspicion\">{{cite episode |title=Above Suspicion|series=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |serieslink=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=September 26, 2012 |season=14 |number=2}}</ref>\n\nThese factors and the stress of the unit wear Cassidy down. After Cassidy loses his temper at Benson in front of the squad, Captain [[Donald Cragen]] ([[Dann Florek]]) tests his readiness to deal with sex crimes by sending him to check up on a teenage rape survivor Cragen met when he worked in homicide. After she details how her abuser systematically violated her and then had her [[gang-rape]]d, Cassidy decides he lacks the stomach to deal with sex crimes and transfers to the [[NYPD|NYPD's]] Narcotics Division.<ref name=\"Green157\" /><ref>{{cite episode |title=Disrobed |series=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |serieslink=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=February 4, 2000 |season=1|number=13}}</ref> Munch later laments that he felt abandoned when Cassidy became the latest in a long line of partners who left him.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Trials |series=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |serieslink=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=September 23, 2008 |season=10 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nCassidy returns 12 years later in the [[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)|Season 13]] episode \"[[Rhodium Nights]]\". He has been working undercover for three years as a bodyguard for a [[pimp]], Bart Ganzel ([[Peter Jacobson]]), and gives the SVU detectives information about Ganzel's prostitution ring.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Rhodium Nights|series=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |serieslink=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=May 23, 2012 |season=13 |number=23}}</ref> When a prostitute who had been dating both Cassidy and Ganzel is found dead in bed with Cragen, Detective [[Nick Amaro]] ([[Danny Pino]]) believes Cassidy played a role in framing Cragen, despite the other SVU detectives vouching for him.

Amaro helps uncover the conspiracy that led to the attack. Cassidy survives and awakens in the hospital, where Benson tells him she is not the same person she was when they first worked together, and kisses him.<ref name=\"AboveSuspicion\" />\n\nIn the episode \"Undercover Blue\", a prostitute accuses Cassidy of raping her while he was undercover four years prior. Investigation reveals the woman and her boss set Cassidy up to make money from suing the NYPD, and the charges are dropped. Because of the longtime consensual relationship Cassidy had had with a prostitute during his undercover stint, however, he is demoted from detective to officer, working nights at a Bronx courthouse. Benson's and Cassidy's relationship, until now a secret to SVU, is also forced into the open in this episode when Amaro and Munch go to Cassidy's apartment and find Benson there; in [[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 15)|Season 15]], the couple move in together.\n\nIn the episode \"Internal Affairs\", [[Internal Affairs Bureau]] Lt. Ed Tucker ([[Robert John Burke]]) puts Cassidy undercover to investigate a corrupt precinct with the promise that, if the operation is successful, he will earn back his detective badge. Although the assignment very nearly leads to his death at the hands of two corrupt cops, it is revealed in the episode \"Rapist Anonymous\" that Cassidy is a detective again and will be working in Internal Affairs. Cassidy and Benson amicably break up during the episode \"Downloaded Child\" after realizing they are fundamentally different people; he prefers to live in the moment, while she plans for the future.\n\nAt the end of Season 19's \"[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 19)#ep411|Gone Fishin']]\", Cassidy returns as a [[District attorney|DA]] investigator and tells Benson he is investigating allegations that she is abusing her adopted son, Noah. In \"Mood\", it is revealed that Cassidy told another DA investigator about Benson and her ordeal with serial rapist William Lewis ([[Pablo Schreiber]]), which indirectly led to the child abuse claim. Benson, furious, says she never wants to speak to him again.\n\nIn \"Chasing Demons\", Cassidy testifies against a child molester he had physically assaulted during arrest. During [[cross-examination]], Cassidy explodes with anger and threatens to kill the defendant, causing a [[mistrial]]. The suspect is murdered the following day after Cassidy is seen at his house, and ADA [[Peter Stone (Chicago and Law & Order character)|Peter Stone]] ([[Philip Winchester]]) has him arrested for murder. The killer, though, turns out to have been one of the suspect's victims, and Cassidy is exonerated. However, Cassidy opens up to Stone, telling him that he was molested as a child by his [[Little League]] coach, something he never told Benson, and that one reason he left the unit was his inability to handle the recurring memories of his abuse.\n\nIn \"Facing Demons\", the suicide of a 22-year-old man leads SVU to Gary Dolan ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]), who molested the victim years before. While searching Dolan's apartment, Benson recognizes Cassidy as a boy in one of Dolan's photographs of the many Little League teams he coached. Benson reaches out to Cassidy to see if he has information about Dolan. Cassidy claims to know nothing, but after the visit, Benson gives an update on the case to Stone, who realizes Dolan must be Cassidy's abuser. He keeps this a secret from Benson and stakes out Dolan's apartment building to make sure Cassidy doesn't attack him. When Dolan arrives and enters, Cassidy exits a nearby car, armed and enraged, and tries to break into the apartment. Stone surprises him in the act, restrains him, and gets him to calm down. Stone wants him to testify against Dolan, but he refuses, partly to avoid facing the memories of his abuse and partly to keep Benson from finding out about it. He does help Stone recruit another of Dolan's victims to testify, but the man's testimony is [[Motion to strike (court of law)|stricken from the record]] when he admits to having drunk alcohol before testifying. Realizing Dolan will go free without any other survivors ready to testify against him, Cassidy, with Benson's encouragement and support, decides to tell the court what Dolan did to him.\n\n==Development==\n{{Quote|text=\"It's amazing. I've wanted to come back for a long time but scheduling difficulties never really permitted it, so, with this storyline, with the [season 13] finale and now what we're doing with the two-hour [season 14] opening movie, it feels like this was the right time to come, so I'm glad I waited.\"|author=[[Dean Winters]]|source=<ref name=\"CelebsCom\" />}} Although Winters previously worked with [[Dick Wolf]] on ''[[New York Undercover]]'',<ref name=\"Green156\">{{Harvnb|Green|p=156}}</ref> he credited fellow cast member [[Richard Belzer]] with getting him the job on ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]''. Belzer and Winters had first worked together when Winters guest-starred on ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', where Belzer was a regular. Wolf invited Belzer to join the cast of his new ''[[Law & Order]]'' spinoff after ''Homicide'' was cancelled, and Belzer told Wolf he would only join the cast if Winters was his partner on the show.<ref name=\"CelebsCom\">{{cite video | people = \"Dean Winters\"| title = \"Dean Winters' Official \"Law & Order: SVU\" Season 14 Premiere Interview\" | medium = Interview video | publisher = Celebs.com| date = September 19, 2012 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkWImRc3AiI}}</ref><ref name=\"Green156\" /> Winters had a role at the same time on the [[HBO]] drama ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'' and, while the ''SVU'' role was initially only supposed to last a few episodes, he was contractually obligated to ''Oz'', and eventually departed ''SVU'' completely to focus on ''Oz''.<ref name=\"Green156\" />\n\nWinters believed that Cassidy was not unintelligent, but simply naive. He voiced early on a desire to executive producer [[Ted Kotcheff]] that Cassidy not be made into the \"[[Blonde stereotype|dumb blonde]]\" of the unit because he did not believe there would be any in the [[Special Victims Unit]].<ref name=\"Green157\" /> Cassidy's character did not see much development, but Winters attributed this to the lack of time the character was on the show. His character appeared during the first half of the first season, when the writers were trying to flesh out all of the characters on the show. Had he remained on the show longer, Winters believed that the writers would have found much more for Cassidy to do.<ref name=\"Green158\">{{Harvnb|Green|p=158}}</ref>\n\nWinters was not bitter that the ''SVU'' role did not work out, and he wanted to return to the series for many years. During the [[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)|13th season]], ''SVU'' was filming scenes in front of the building where Winters lived, so he chatted with the cast and crew, especially his former costar [[Mariska Hargitay]].

A recurring cast member during the first season, Cassidy is a young and inexperienced detective with the [[New York Police Department]]'s [[Special Victims Unit]], and the original partner of [[John Munch]] ([[Richard Belzer]]). The stress of the Special Victims Unit is too much for Cassidy, and he transfers to the Narcotics unit in the middle of the season. Cassidy later returns in the [[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)|13th-season]] finale working undercover for a [[pimp]] the SVU detectives are investigating. Winters had previously worked with creator [[Dick Wolf]], but he was offered a role on ''SVU'' through Belzer, though the role proved to be temporary due to Winters' commitment to ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''. As Winters only remained with the series for 13 episodes, his character never had much of a chance to develop. Winters wanted to return to the show for a long time, though, and felt the time was right during the [[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)|13th-season]] finale. Critics were generally negative about Cassidy during the character's initial tenure on the show, but some were glad to see his return in \"[[Rhodium Nights]]\".\n\n==Character biography==\n\nEven though Brian Cassidy is a dedicated member of the Special Victims Unit, he lacks the language to describe sex crimes and the emotional maturity to deal with them.<ref name=\"Green157\">{{Harvnb|Green|p=157}}</ref> He views his partner, [[John Munch]] ([[Richard Belzer]]), as a mentor.\n\nCassidy has a drunken [[one-night stand]] with fellow SVU Detective [[Olivia Benson]] ([[Mariska Hargitay]]) but wants to pursue a relationship with her. She turns him down, citing a policy of not having relationships with co-workers.<ref name=\"Green157\" /><ref>{{cite episode |title=Closure |series=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |serieslink=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=January 7, 2000 |season=1|number=10}}</ref> Years later, Benson expresses regret at the way she handled the situation.<ref name=\"AboveSuspicion\">{{cite episode |title=Above Suspicion|series=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |serieslink=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=September 26, 2012 |season=14 |number=2}}</ref>\n\nThese factors and the stress of the unit wear Cassidy down. After Cassidy loses his temper at Benson in front of the squad, Captain [[Donald Cragen]] ([[Dann Florek]]) tests his readiness to deal with sex crimes by sending him to check up on a teenage rape survivor Cragen met when he worked in homicide. After she details how her abuser systematically violated her and then had her [[gang-rape]]d, Cassidy decides he lacks the stomach to deal with sex crimes and transfers to the [[NYPD|NYPD's]] Narcotics Division.<ref name=\"Green157\" /><ref>{{cite episode |title=Disrobed |series=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |serieslink=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=February 4, 2000 |season=1|number=13}}</ref> Munch later laments that he felt abandoned when Cassidy became the latest in a long line of partners who left him.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Trials |series=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |serieslink=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=September 23, 2008 |season=10 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nCassidy returns 12 years later in the [[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)|Season 13]] episode \"[[Rhodium Nights]]\". He has been working undercover for three years as a bodyguard for a [[pimp]], Bart Ganzel ([[Peter Jacobson]]), and gives the SVU detectives information about Ganzel's prostitution ring.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Rhodium Nights|series=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |serieslink=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=May 23, 2012 |season=13 |number=23}}</ref> When a prostitute who had been dating both Cassidy and Ganzel is found dead in bed with Cragen, Detective [[Nick Amaro]] ([[Danny Pino]]) believes Cassidy played a role in framing Cragen, despite the other SVU detectives vouching for him. Amaro confronts Cassidy at gunpoint and tries to force information out of him.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lost Reputation|series=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |serieslink=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=September 26, 2012 |season=14 |number=1}}</ref> After Ganzel discovers Cassidy is working undercover to expose him, he has a corrupt NYPD police officer shoot Cassidy. Amaro helps uncover the conspiracy that led to the attack. Cassidy survives and awakens in the hospital, where Benson tells him she is not the same person she was when they first worked together, and kisses him.<ref name=\"AboveSuspicion\" />\n\nIn the episode \"Undercover Blue\", a prostitute accuses Cassidy of raping her while he was undercover four years prior. Investigation reveals the woman and her boss set Cassidy up to make money from suing the NYPD, and the charges are dropped. Because of the longtime consensual relationship Cassidy had had with a prostitute during his undercover stint, however, he is demoted from detective to officer, working nights at a Bronx courthouse. Benson's and Cassidy's relationship, until now a secret to SVU, is also forced into the open in this episode when Amaro and Munch go to Cassidy's apartment and find Benson there; in [[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 15)|Season 15]], the couple move in together.\n\nIn the episode \"Internal Affairs\", [[Internal Affairs Bureau]] Lt. Ed Tucker ([[Robert John Burke]]) puts Cassidy undercover to investigate a corrupt precinct with the promise that, if the operation is successful, he will earn back his detective badge. Although the assignment very nearly leads to his death at the hands of two corrupt cops, it is revealed in the episode \"Rapist Anonymous\" that Cassidy is a detective again and will be working in Internal Affairs. Cassidy and Benson amicably break up during the episode \"Downloaded Child\" after realizing they are fundamentally different people; he prefers to live in the moment, while she plans for the future.\n\nAt the end of Season 19's \"[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 19)#ep411|Gone Fishin']]\", Cassidy returns as a [[District attorney|DA]] investigator and tells Benson he is investigating allegations that she is abusing her adopted son, Noah. In \"Mood\", it is revealed that Cassidy told another DA investigator about Benson and her ordeal with serial rapist William Lewis ([[Pablo Schreiber]]), which indirectly led to the child abuse claim. Benson, furious, says she never wants to speak to him again.\n\nIn \"Chasing Demons\", Cassidy testifies against a child molester he had physically assaulted during arrest. During [[cross-examination]], Cassidy explodes with anger and threatens to kill the defendant, causing a [[mistrial]]. The suspect is murdered the following day after Cassidy is seen at his house, and ADA [[Peter Stone (Chicago and Law & Order character)|Peter Stone]] ([[Philip Winchester]]) has him arrested for murder. The killer, though, turns out to have been one of the suspect's victims, and Cassidy is exonerated. However, Cassidy opens up to Stone, telling him that he was molested as a child by his [[Little League]] coach, something he never told Benson, and that one reason he left the unit was his inability to handle the recurring memories of his abuse.\n\nIn \"Facing Demons\", the suicide of a 22-year-old man leads SVU to Gary Dolan ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]), who molested the victim years before. While searching Dolan's apartment, Benson recognizes Cassidy as a boy in one of Dolan's photographs of the many Little League teams he coached. Benson reaches out to Cassidy to see if he has information about Dolan. Cassidy claims to know nothing, but after the visit, Benson gives an update on the case to Stone, who realizes Dolan must be Cassidy's abuser. He keeps this a secret from Benson and stakes out Dolan's apartment building to make sure Cassidy doesn't attack him. When Dolan arrives and enters, Cassidy exits a nearby car, armed and enraged, and tries to break into the apartment. Stone surprises him in the act, restrains him, and gets him to calm down. Stone wants him to testify against Dolan, but he refuses, partly to avoid facing the memories of his abuse and partly to keep Benson from finding out about it. He does help Stone recruit another of Dolan\u2019s victims to testify, but the man\u2019s testimony is [[Motion to strike (court of law)|stricken from the record]] when he admits to having drunk alcohol before testifying. Realizing Dolan will go free without any other survivors ready to testify against him, Cassidy, with Benson's encouragement and support, decides to tell the court what Dolan did to him.\n\n==Development==\n{{Quote|text=\"It's amazing.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the twenty-fourth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Cate Shortland]] and written by [[Eric Pearson]] from a story by [[Jac Schaeffer]] and [[Ned Benson]], and stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]] alongside [[Florence Pugh]], [[David Harbour]], [[O-T Fagbenle]], [[William Hurt]], [[Ray Winstone]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Set after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.\n\nDevelopment of a Black Widow film began in April 2004 by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], with [[David Hayter]] attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006.

Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018. Benson joined in early 2019, with Pearson added later. Filming took place from May to October, in [[Norway]], [[Budapest]], [[Morocco]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and in [[Atlanta]] and [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled to be released on November 6, 2020 in the United States, after being delayed from May 2020 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"BWTimeline\" /> [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past.

Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter \"never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously.\" This left Hayter \"heartbroken\", but he hoped the film would be made \"some day\".<ref name=\"LionsGateDrop\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Marvel entered early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play Black Widow in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> In March 2009, [[Scarlett Johansson]] signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of ''Iron Man 2'', Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel's focus was on 2012's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"IGNSep2010\" /> Johansson appeared in that film as the character,<ref name=\"Avengers\" /> as well as 2014's ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'',<ref name=\"WinterSoldier\" /> 2015's ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'',<ref name=\"AvengersAoU\" /> 2016's ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"CapCW\" /> 2018's ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',<ref name=\"InfinityWar\" /> and 2019's ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"Endgame\" /> After the release of ''Age of Ultron'', Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the \"demand of the character\", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's \"great reaction\" to the character and her performance.<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" />\n\nIn February 2014, Feige stated that after exploring Black Widow's past in ''Age of Ultron'', he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it,<ref name=\"BlackWidowSolo\" /> including a \"pretty in depth\" treatment by [[Nicole Perlman]], who co-wrote Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"PerlmanWidow\" /> The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience.<ref name=\"JohanssonApr2014\" /> That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,<ref name=\"HayterRevive\" /> and the following month, director [[Neil Marshall]] stated that he \"would {{em|love}} to do a Black Widow film,\" saying he felt the character was \"really interesting [given] she doesn't have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-[[K.G.B.]] assassin, I find that really fascinating.\"<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the different \"layers\" of her depicted in the different films so far, but also stating that \"right now I think this character is used well in this part of the universe\".<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" /> While promoting ''Captain America: Civil War'' the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential ''Black Widow'' film would be four or five years away.<ref name=\"FeigeApril2016\" /> He added that Marvel was \"creatively and emotionally\" committed to making a ''Black Widow'' film eventually.<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Joss Whedon]], the director of ''The Avengers'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', stated that he was open to directing a ''Black Widow'' film, feeling he could make \"a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, '[[John le Carr\u00e9]] on crack' sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"WhedonJuly2016\" /> In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She did caution she may not want to \"wear a skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.<ref name=\"JohanssonOct2016\" /> The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2017\" /> Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the \"best time to move forward with the project\" would be at the beginning of the \"latest phase\" of the MCU in 2020.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" />\n\nIn October 2017, Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a potential solo film, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including [[Jac Schaeffer]].<ref name=\"KrollThanksgiving\" /> Schaeffer met with Feige again in December, and was hired to write a script for the film before the end of 2017.<ref name=\"SchaefferJan2018\" /><ref name=\"KrollSchaeffer\" /> Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.<ref name=\"KrollUpdate\" /> Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,<ref name=\"May2018Directors\" /> including [[Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven]], [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who was eventually chosen to direct Marvel's ''[[The Eternals (film)|The Eternals]]''<ref name=\"Zhao\" />\u2014[[Amma Asante]],<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> and [[Lynn Shelton]].<ref name=\"SheltonConsidered\" /> In the following months, this was reduced to a shortlist of 49 directors before the top choices of [[Cate Shortland]], Asante, and [[Maggie Betts]] met with Feige and Johansson in June.<ref name=\"Jun2018Directors\" /> [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Kimberly Peirce]] were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".<ref name=\"Jul2018Directors\" /><ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" /> Shortland had the backing of Johansson, a fan of the director's previous female-starring film ''[[Lore (film)|Lore]]'' (2012), and was hired the next month.<ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" />\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in ''The Avengers''. $15 million is what [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]] each earned for the third films in their MCU franchises\u2014''Civil War'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), respectively. The pair also earned that amount for co-starring in ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''. Despite ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirming these amounts with \"multiple knowledgeable sources\" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers and said that they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms.\"<ref name=\"JohannsonPayOct2018\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2019, [[Ned Benson]] was hired to rewrite the script,<ref name=\"BensonRewriteFebruary2019\" /> and Feige confirmed the studio was not looking to have the film receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which had been rumored previously.<ref name=\"RRatingFalse\" /> The following month, [[Florence Pugh]] entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is \"morally opposite\" to Romanoff.<ref name=\"PughTHR\" /> Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018 but began looking at other actresses, including [[Saoirse Ronan]], in early 2019.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /><ref name=\"RonanVariety\" /> The studio returned to Pugh for the role after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film ''[[Fighting with My Family]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /> In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside [[David Harbour]],<ref name=\"Harbour\" /> [[Rachel Weisz]],<ref name=\"Weisz\" /><ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> and [[O-T Fagbenle]].<ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> Feige likened the film to the television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', which is a prequel to the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', because it was \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... [but] it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before.\"<ref name=\"Feigeio9June2019\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 28, 2019, in [[Norway]].<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> By early June, production moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London,<ref name=\"PinewoodFilming\" /> while [[Ray Winstone]] joined the film later that month.<ref name=\"Winstone\" /> The film was officially announced at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In August, bodybuilder [[Olivier Richters]] announced that he had been cast in the film.<ref name=\"Richters\" /> The next month, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]].<ref name=\"Downey\" /> A [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party for the film was held at the end of September,<ref name=\"FilmingStartDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Macon\" /> before production moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]], were dressed to portray [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Macon\" /> Set photos in October revealed [[William Hurt]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]].<ref name=\"Hurt\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Budapest]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"PughNov2019\" /> Filming officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\nRegarding the film's action sequences, Shortland said they had to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven.\" ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010) was also a source of inspiration for Shortland.<ref name=\"EmpireMagazineMay2020\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2020, a special look trailer credited [[Eric Pearson]] as the screenwriter for the film, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit.<ref name=\"WritingCredits\" /> Additionally, Jeff Sneider of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' pointed out that the trailer's credit block did not include a cinematographer for the film. He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was now scoring the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The first teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nA final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled to be released on November 6, 2020.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It was originally scheduled for release in the United States on May 1, 2020,<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> but was delayed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> \n\nAfter the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted in early March from April 2020 to November 2020 due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, especially the fact that theaters in many Asian countries were closed due to the pandemic, commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' being postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020 despite the pandemic.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed, which he said was \"the logical choice at this juncture\" feeling there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S. especially when the film was \"already in its ideal release date\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], and Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise, though a Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline. Vary and Donnelly speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the twenty-fourth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Cate Shortland]] and written by [[Eric Pearson]] from a story by [[Jac Schaeffer]] and [[Ned Benson]], and stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]] alongside [[Florence Pugh]], [[David Harbour]], [[O-T Fagbenle]], [[William Hurt]], [[Ray Winstone]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Set after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.\n\nDevelopment of a Black Widow film began in April 2004 by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], with [[David Hayter]] attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010). Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018.

Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter \"never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously.\" This left Hayter \"heartbroken\", but he hoped the film would be made \"some day\".<ref name=\"LionsGateDrop\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Marvel entered early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play Black Widow in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> In March 2009, [[Scarlett Johansson]] signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of ''Iron Man 2'', Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel's focus was on 2012's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"IGNSep2010\" /> Johansson appeared in that film as the character,<ref name=\"Avengers\" /> as well as 2014's ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'',<ref name=\"WinterSoldier\" /> 2015's ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'',<ref name=\"AvengersAoU\" /> 2016's ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"CapCW\" /> 2018's ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',<ref name=\"InfinityWar\" /> and 2019's ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"Endgame\" /> After the release of ''Age of Ultron'', Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the \"demand of the character\", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's \"great reaction\" to the character and her performance.<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" />\n\nIn February 2014, Feige stated that after exploring Black Widow's past in ''Age of Ultron'', he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it,<ref name=\"BlackWidowSolo\" /> including a \"pretty in depth\" treatment by [[Nicole Perlman]], who co-wrote Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"PerlmanWidow\" /> The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience.<ref name=\"JohanssonApr2014\" /> That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,<ref name=\"HayterRevive\" /> and the following month, director [[Neil Marshall]] stated that he \"would {{em|love}} to do a Black Widow film,\" saying he felt the character was \"really interesting [given] she doesn't have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-[[K.G.B.]] assassin, I find that really fascinating.\"<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the different \"layers\" of her depicted in the different films so far, but also stating that \"right now I think this character is used well in this part of the universe\".<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" /> While promoting ''Captain America: Civil War'' the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential ''Black Widow'' film would be four or five years away.<ref name=\"FeigeApril2016\" /> He added that Marvel was \"creatively and emotionally\" committed to making a ''Black Widow'' film eventually.<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Joss Whedon]], the director of ''The Avengers'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', stated that he was open to directing a ''Black Widow'' film, feeling he could make \"a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, '[[John le Carr\u00e9]] on crack' sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"WhedonJuly2016\" /> In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She did caution she may not want to \"wear a skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.<ref name=\"JohanssonOct2016\" /> The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2017\" /> Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the \"best time to move forward with the project\" would be at the beginning of the \"latest phase\" of the MCU in 2020.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" />\n\nIn October 2017, Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a potential solo film, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including [[Jac Schaeffer]].<ref name=\"KrollThanksgiving\" /> Schaeffer met with Feige again in December, and was hired to write a script for the film before the end of 2017.<ref name=\"SchaefferJan2018\" /><ref name=\"KrollSchaeffer\" /> Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.<ref name=\"KrollUpdate\" /> Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,<ref name=\"May2018Directors\" /> including [[Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven]], [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who was eventually chosen to direct Marvel's ''[[The Eternals (film)|The Eternals]]''<ref name=\"Zhao\" />\u2014[[Amma Asante]],<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> and [[Lynn Shelton]].<ref name=\"SheltonConsidered\" /> In the following months, this was reduced to a shortlist of 49 directors before the top choices of [[Cate Shortland]], Asante, and [[Maggie Betts]] met with Feige and Johansson in June.<ref name=\"Jun2018Directors\" /> [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Kimberly Peirce]] were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".<ref name=\"Jul2018Directors\" /><ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" /> Shortland had the backing of Johansson, a fan of the director's previous female-starring film ''[[Lore (film)|Lore]]'' (2012), and was hired the next month.<ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" />\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in ''The Avengers''. $15 million is what [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]] each earned for the third films in their MCU franchises\u2014''Civil War'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), respectively. The pair also earned that amount for co-starring in ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''. Despite ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirming these amounts with \"multiple knowledgeable sources\" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers and said that they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms.\"<ref name=\"JohannsonPayOct2018\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2019, [[Ned Benson]] was hired to rewrite the script,<ref name=\"BensonRewriteFebruary2019\" /> and Feige confirmed the studio was not looking to have the film receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which had been rumored previously.<ref name=\"RRatingFalse\" /> The following month, [[Florence Pugh]] entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is \"morally opposite\" to Romanoff.<ref name=\"PughTHR\" /> Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018 but began looking at other actresses, including [[Saoirse Ronan]], in early 2019.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /><ref name=\"RonanVariety\" /> The studio returned to Pugh for the role after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film ''[[Fighting with My Family]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /> In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside [[David Harbour]],<ref name=\"Harbour\" /> [[Rachel Weisz]],<ref name=\"Weisz\" /><ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> and [[O-T Fagbenle]].<ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> Feige likened the film to the television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', which is a prequel to the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', because it was \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... [but] it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before.\"<ref name=\"Feigeio9June2019\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 28, 2019, in [[Norway]].<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> By early June, production moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London,<ref name=\"PinewoodFilming\" /> while [[Ray Winstone]] joined the film later that month.<ref name=\"Winstone\" /> The film was officially announced at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In August, bodybuilder [[Olivier Richters]] announced that he had been cast in the film.<ref name=\"Richters\" /> The next month, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]].<ref name=\"Downey\" /> A [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party for the film was held at the end of September,<ref name=\"FilmingStartDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Macon\" /> before production moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]], were dressed to portray [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Macon\" /> Set photos in October revealed [[William Hurt]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]].<ref name=\"Hurt\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Budapest]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"PughNov2019\" /> Filming officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\nRegarding the film's action sequences, Shortland said they had to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven.\" ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010) was also a source of inspiration for Shortland.<ref name=\"EmpireMagazineMay2020\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2020, a special look trailer credited [[Eric Pearson]] as the screenwriter for the film, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit.<ref name=\"WritingCredits\" /> Additionally, Jeff Sneider of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' pointed out that the trailer's credit block did not include a cinematographer for the film. He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was now scoring the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The first teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nA final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled to be released on November 6, 2020.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It was originally scheduled for release in the United States on May 1, 2020,<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> but was delayed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> \n\nAfter the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted in early March from April 2020 to November 2020 due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, especially the fact that theaters in many Asian countries were closed due to the pandemic, commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' being postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020 despite the pandemic.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed, which he said was \"the logical choice at this juncture\" feeling there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S. especially when the film was \"already in its ideal release date\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], and Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise, though a Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline. Vary and Donnelly speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite

Harrison Jr.2.jpg|thumb|left|Harrison Jr. as Cadet at West Point in 1913.]]\nHarrison graduated with [[Bachelor of Science]] degree on April 20, 1917, shortly following the United States entry into World War I, and was commissioned second lieutenant in the [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry branch]]. He was subsequently ordered to [[Camp Lawrence J. Hearn]], [[California]], where he joined [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry Regiment]].<ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref>\n\nHe was subsequently ordered with the regiment to [[Douglas, Arizona]], from which his unit participated in the guard duties on the Mexican Border. Harrison reached consecutively the ranks of first lieutenant and Captain and returned to West Point Military Academy as an Instructor of French and Spanish languages. While in this capacity, he also completed advanced languages courses in French and Spanish.<ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref>\n\nHarrison was later transferred to the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th Cavalry Regiment]] at [[Fort Bliss]], [[Texas]] and served with that unit until early 1923, when he was ordered to [[Washington, D.C.]] for duty on the staff of [[United States Army War College|Army War College]]. He was promoted to Major during his service there and left for the Philippines in 1925, where he was attached to the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|26th Cavalry Regiment]] ([[Philippine Scouts]]) at [[Camp Stotsenburg]] on [[Luzon]].<ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref>\n\nFollowing his return stateside in 1932, Harrison was attached to the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th Cavalry Regiment]] at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]]. While stationed at Fort Riley, he completed advanced course at Army Cavalry School there and served on the Cavalry Board and as Troop Commander with [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]].<ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref>\n\nHarrison was ordered to the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Army Command and General Staff School]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]] in June 1936 and graduated one year later. He then joined the faculty of the school and served as an instructor of tactics until September 1937, when he was ordered to the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]] for instruction.<ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref>\n\nHe graduated in July 1938 and joined the [[6th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|6th Cavalry Regiment]] at [[Fort Oglethorpe (Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia)|Fort Oglethorpe]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Harrison remained in that assignment until August 1939, when he was attached to War Plans Division, [[War Department General Staff]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] While in this capacity, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel on July 1, 1940.<ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\n==World War II==\n===Stateside service===\n[[File:Harrison Jr., Lee Gerow, Crawford, Eisenhower, Leonard Gerow, Handy, Sherrill, McKee, MacKelvie at the meeting of War Plans Division.jpg|thumb|right|The meeting of War Plans Division, War Department General Staff in 1942.

MacKelvie|MacKelvie]].]]\nFollowing the United States entry into World War II, Harrison was promoted to the temporary rank of Colonel on December 11, 1941, just four days after Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. He was appointed Deputy Chief of Strategy & Policy Group, War Plans Division, [[War Department General Staff]] and also was given additional duty at General [[George C. Marshall]]'s Committee on Allocation of Responsibilities which was given the job of figuring out a reorganization of the Army High command. For his service in this capacity, Harrison was promoted to the temporary rank of Brigadier general on June 26, 1942.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref><ref name=\"William K. Harrison Jr. Papers - Army Center of Military History\"></ref>\n\nHe was subsequently ordered to [[Camp Butner]], [[North Carolina]], where he was attached to the [[78th Infantry Division (United States)|78th Infantry Division]] under Major general [[Edwin P. Parker Jr.]] as Assistant Division Commander. Harrison then participated in the training of replacements for units serving overseas and suffered minor injury on an obstacle course in December 1942. While recuperating, he received a telephone call from Major general [[Leland S. Hobbs]], commanding general, [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Infantry Division]], informing him about his new assignment with Hobbs division.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name=\"Arlington\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison was replaced by Brigadier general [[John K. Rice]] and appointed Assistant Division Commander under Hobbs, who tasked him with organization of the 30th Infantry Division's training at [[Camp Blanding]], [[Florida]]. Harrison and Hobbs had know each other from [[West Point]], where Hobbs was a member of Class 1915 and also were in the same class at the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Army Command and General Staff School]] in 1937.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nBilly Harrison had almost no respect for Hobbs as a leader of the troops. From Harrison's point of view, Hobbs violated every principle of leadership except one: He demanded obedience and gave it to his superiors. But in almost every other aspects - from training and disciplining men to planning battle operations in the field. In short, Harrison described Hobbs as being \"{{sic|?|stricly}} a Barracks soldier\", who accustomed himself to applause.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref><ref name=\"William K. Harrison Jr. Papers - Army Center of Military History\"></ref>\n\nDespite this, Harrison remained loyal to Hobbs, who never received anything than support from his Assistant Division Commander. On the other hand, Harrison benefited from Hobbs's apparent weakness, when he had the opportunity to be with his men during the training and later in combat.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison participated in the training of his troops for the upcoming [[Tennessee Maneuver Area|Tennessee Maneuvers]] in September-November 1943, where 30th Division showed considerable alertness and skills. Following the maneuvers, the division moved to [[Camp Atterbury]], [[Indiana]], where it concentrated on preparation for movement overseas.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref><ref name=\"William K. Harrison Jr. Papers - Army Center of Military History\"></ref>\n\n===Overseas duty===\n\nHarrison led divisional advanced party overseas by the end of January 1944 and spent several next months with intensive training in [[England]]. The 30th Infantry Division departed for [[France]] in June that year and landed at [[Omaha Beach]], [[Normandy]] on June 11, 1944. Harrison participated in the combats at Vire-et-Taute Canal and on [[Vire River]] and quickly won the admiration of his troops by accompanying them on the front lines with [[M3 submachine gun]] in hand. He also spent a first night in France in the trench with combat troops.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name=\"NY Times\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nOn July 25, 1944, the 30th Infantry Division still participated in the combats near [[Saint-L\u00f4]], which it secured few days earlier. The Division was subsequently scheduled to participate in [[Operation Cobra]], an offensive with intention to advance into [[Brittany]]. The offensive was to begin with a major saturation bombing of the enemy with the troops then moving in afterward, but due to the inaccurate plane navigation, planes bombed erroneously their own men. More than 600 of the men had been hit, many killed, including lieutenant general [[Lesley J. McNair]], Commander of [[Army Ground Forces]].<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nEven Harrison's command group was located in the rear, he returned deliberately to the forward area shortly before the bombing began. He was thrown down by the blast of German Artillery fire, but was unharmed. Realizing that the success of the entire operation depended on the 30th Infantry Division carrying out its mission, Harrison began analyzing the situation and found out, that divisional [[Sherman tank]]s were totally disorganized and demoralized infantry was spread in the area. Moreover commanding officer of [[120th Infantry Regiment (United States)|120th Infantry Regiment]], Colonel [[Hammond D. Birks]] was located somewhere in the forward area and his jeep was knocked out.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n[[File:Brigadier General William K. Harrison, Jr. and Capt. John E. Kent, Co. A, 117th.jpg|thumb|left|Harrison, armed with [[M3 submachine gun]] in conversation with Capt. John E. Kent, Co. A, 117th Infantry Regiment somewhere in France, fall 1944.]]\nHarrison ordered commander to get his tanks in battle formation and get ready for action and evacuated Colonel Birks to safety. He took soldier with [[bazooka]] through the hedgerow and ordered him to attack the German tank nearby. The soldier had hit German tank several times, but panicked and ran into the open, where he was killed. Harrison crawled back and came upon four American tanks in a neighboring field, who were waiting out the enemy shelling with their hatches shut tight. He climbed on the commander's tank and forced the crew to open the hatch by beating the tank's turret, subsequently ordering the general attack, which was successful. For his heroism in action, he was decorated with [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], the second highest decorations of the United States military for valor in combat.<ref name=\"Valor awards for William K.

The 30th Division then advanced through [[Belgium]] and Harrison distinguished himself again on September 2, 1944, while leading the Task Force of his division.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHe was riding with the forward elements of his Task Force heading to [[Rumilly-en-Cambr\u00e9sis|Rumilly]], when his column was ambushed by enemy tanks. The Harrison's jeep was hit in the radiator and he was struck by enemy 75mm tank shell, hitting him to right shoulder, arm and leg. Harrison escaped from the damaged vehicle and hit the ditch, where he immediately dispatched his aide and driver to contact the next ranking officer in order that he might continue the advance. He did not mention his wounds, which were not visible due to his raincoat and crawled approximately 600 yards to the rear of the column in order to give further instructions for continuing the mission.<ref name=\"Musings of a Snickerdoodle\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison fainted momentarily due to his wounds, but refused to be evacuated until he had contacted his subordinates and instructed them in the continuation of the attack. By the time, General Hobbs arrived and following a discovery of Harrison's wounds, he ordered his evacuation. For bravery in action, he was decorated with [[Silver Star]] and also received [[Purple Heart]] for wounds, which he was most proud of.<ref name=\"Valor awards for William K. Harrison Jr.\"></ref><ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref><ref name=\"William K. Harrison Jr. Papers - Army Center of Military History\"></ref>\n\nHe spent a week in [[First United States Army|First Army]] Hospital in [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]] and rejoined his division in Belgian town of [[Tongres]], where the division's progress was halted due to fuel shortages and quagmire roads. The 30th Division then proceeded to the [[Netherlands]], where liberated town of [[Kerkrade]] on September 25, 1944 and advanced to [[Germany]], where took part in the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|combats on the Siegfried Line]] and subsequently in the [[Battle of Aachen|battle of heavily defended city of Aachen]] on October 2.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n[[File:William H.

Germany, February 1945.]]\nThe 30th Infantry Division was ordered for rest and refit to the rear by the end of November 1944 and transferred to the [[Ninth United States Army]] under lieutenant general [[William H. Simpson]]. Harrison was tasked by Simpson himself to conduct a refresher course for all infantry and artillery commanders in the Ninth United States Army, down to the battalion level. Harrison lectured the tactics employed by his command in taking of several towns and then took the entire class to the field trip to Sankt J\u00f6ris near Aachen, where artillery and tanks were set up to demonstrate how they had been used in the attack there.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison and 30th Division returned to the frontlines following the [[Battle of the Bulge|launch of German massive offensive in Ardennes]] on December 17, 1944 and participated in the combats in [[Malmedy massacre|Malmedy-Stavelot]] area. Hobbs tasked Harrison with the command of Task Force, consisting of [[119th Infantry Regiment (United States)|119th Infantry Regiment]], which later repelled German assault at [[La Gleize]]. Harrison and his task force destroyed or captured 178 enemy armored vehicles, including 39 tanks.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHe was out of action during January 1945, when he suffered an infection requiring surgery. Following his return at the beginning of February 1945, Harrison was visited by General [[William H. Simpson]], Commanding general, [[Ninth United States Army]], who presented him with [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Army Distinguished Service Medal]] for his previous service with the War Plans Division, [[War Department General Staff]], where he proposed new concept of organization.<ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nDuring March 1945, the 30th Division was located in the rear for rest and refit and conducted training for next deployment. Harrison took part in [[Operation Plunder|the crossing of Rhine River]] on March 23, and advanced further to Germany. After taking [[Hamelin]] and [[Braunschweig]] at the beginning of April 1945, the 30th Division Task Force under Harrison's command discovered two large groups of Hungarian Jews Women at [[Teutoburg Forest]].<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nOn April 13, 1945, Harrison participated in the efforts to save 2,400 prisoners from [[Neuengamme concentration camp]] subcamp at [[Farsleben]], whom they found locked in the train boxcars. The 30th Division then proceeded eastward and  halted its advanced on [[Elbe River]] at [[Grunewald]] linking up with Soviet forces.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nFor his service with 30th Infantry Division, Harrison received [[Legion of Merit]] and two [[Bronze Star Medal]]s. The Allies bestowed him with several decorations including: [[Legion of Honour]], [[Croix de Guerre 1939-1945 (France)|Croix de Guerre with Palm]] by [[France]], [[Distinguished Service Order]] by [[Great Britain]], [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] by the [[Netherlands]] and [[Order of the Red Banner]] by [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"Valor awards for William K.

He returned to the United States by the end of July and commanded the Second division during the preparations for combat deployment to the Pacific area.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"NY Times\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHe was relieved by Major general [[Edward M. Almond]] in September 1945 and assumed duty as his deputy and Assistant Division Commander. Due to [[surrender of Japan]], the deployment to Pacific was canceled and Harrison served with the 2nd Division at [[Camp Swift, Texas]] until April 1946. Harrison was then appointed Commanding general, [[Camp Carson]], [[Colorado]], where he was responsible for the demobilization of troops returning from war zones in Europe and Pacific.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name=\"NY Times\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nIn November 1946, Harrison was reversed to the peacetime rank of Colonel and ordered to [[Japan]], where he was attached to the General Headquarters of [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]] under General [[Douglas MacArthur]] as Executive for Administrative Affairs and Reparations. While in this capacity, he collaborated closely with General MacArthur and was responsible for the restoration of Japanese Economy as rapidly as possible.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Arlington\"></ref><ref name=\"NY Times\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHe remained in this capacity until January 1947, when he was appointed Commanding officer, General Headquarters, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers and also held additional duty as Executive officer of [[Far East Command (United States)|Far East Command]].<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison was promoted again to Brigadier general on January 24, 1948 and appointed Chief of Reparations Section at the headquarters of Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers and held this assignment until December 1948, when he was ordered back to the United States.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHe was subsequently appointed Chief of Armed Forces Information & Education Division, Department of the Army in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was promoted to Major general on March 11, 1949. While in this capacity, Harrison was responsible for the propaganda and university extension courses. He didn't like that job and following the outbreak of [[Korean War]], he applied to be assigned for a field command, hoping that Army Chief of Personnel, [[Matthew B. Ridgway]], who was his friend and West Point Classmate, would help him.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nUnfortunately, Ridgway couldn't help him at the time and offered him post as Commanding general, [[Fort Dix]], [[New Jersey]] with additional duty as commanding general, [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]]. Harrison accepted the offer in September 1950 and was responsible for the training of replacements for troops both in Europe and [[Korea]]. During sixteen-week training cycles, he had to transform young men into effective soldiers, but his methods were not met with understanding by some of the recruits parents and also with some unfavorable press.<ref name=\"NY Times\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nThe night marches and forced sixteen-mile marches with packs caused complaints to Congressmen. When the father of one recruit was invited to spend a week at the barracks with his son, he changed his mind and upon returning home, he wrote a second letter to the Editor of the newspaper, withdrawing all his criticism.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison also ordered total racial integration of living accommodations at Fort Dix. It should be mentioned that he was no racist, but neither a civil right activist. He did that because he needed his barracks to run in a more efficient manner. The barracks for white recruits were overcrowded and the ones for African American were half empty. The training was also racially integrated by Harrison.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref><ref name=\"William K.

After reporting to general Van Fleet, Harrison inspected every 8th Army's combat division located on the [[Jamestown Line]] (including American, [[British Commonwealth]], [[South Korea]]n or United Nations troops) from [[Yellow Sea]] to the [[Sea of Japan]].<ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHe gained awareness of the situation on the front, terrain and enemy positions, but there were no major military operations, just stalemate. The North Koreans and U.N. troops were located on the [[Jamestown Line]] and truce talks between [[United Nations]] and [[North Korea]] were already in effect. However general [[Matthew B. Ridgway]] was not satisfied with one member of the U.N. negotiation team, Major general [[Claude B. Ferenbaugh]] and replaced him with Harrison in January 1952.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison was attached to the U.S. team under Vice admiral [[C. Turner Joy]] and participated in the regular negotiations with North Korean and Chinese representatives at [[Panmunjon]]. The negotiations were ineffective and communists used the truce talks just for propaganda purposes and to strengthen their positions on the Jamestown Line. Admiral Joy was planning his own departure in mid-1952 and recommended Harrison as his replacement.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nRidgway agreed and announced the change of command to Washington, where it was confirmed in May 1952, when Harrison was appointed Senior Member of the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Korean Armistice Delegation]]. He also nominated Harrison for the temporary rank of lieutenant general, but [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Service Committee]] rejected the promotion.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name=\"Arlington\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nIn May 1952, General [[Mark W.

The Army Chief of Staff, General [[J.

Clark]] and retained his assignment as Senior Member in the truce talks team. He participated in the regular meetings with North Korean delegation led by General [[Nam Il]] and had to handle more North Korean attempts to use truce talks as the platform for propaganda. He despised the communists, who he regarded with contempt as ''common criminals'' and for example in June 1952, he left the truce meeting, when he saw that the negotiation was without result, leaving North Korean General Nam Il flabbergasted.<ref name=\"NY Times\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nIn September 1953, Harrison assumed duty as Chief of Staff and Deputy Commanding general, [[Far East Command (United States)|Far East Command]] under General [[Mark W.

Harrison served in the Far East until May 1954, when he returned to the United States for new assignment. For his service in [[Korea]] during the Armistice negotiations and later with Far East Forces, he was decorated with [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]]. [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] awarded him the [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath]].<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Valor awards for William K.

He attended many parades and banquets, where he featured as speaker and was given honorary degrees from the [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] in [[Illinois]] and the [[Houghton College]] in [[New York (state)|New York]]. Harrison was also featured as speaker at [[Easter sunrise service]] at the famous [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl stadium]] in [[Pasadena, California]].\n\nHe then arrived to the [[Panama Canal Zone]] on June 16, 1954 and assumed duty as Commander-in-Chief, [[United States Southern Command|United States Caribbean Command]] with headquarters in [[Quarry Heights]]. His main task was the defense of the [[Panama Canal]] and its coast, which was divided into Atlantic and Pacific Sectors. Harrison arrived in a country with an unstable political situation, because a few months after his arrival, President of Panama, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rem\u00f3n Cantera]] was assassinated and his successor, [[Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Guizado]], was arrested for conspiracy and murder.\n\nHarrison participated in many ceremonies including the [[Inauguration]] of President [[Ernesto de la Guardia]] in October 1956 (as a member of the United States delegation). He also hosted President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and then-Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1955.\n\nHe instituted military training exercises, both amphibious and paratroop, in the Canal Zone and forces came from the United States. Harrison intended to demonstrate to Panama's neighbors the capabilities of the United States Army. Harrison was succeeded by lieutenant general [[Robert M.

MacKelvie|MacKelvie]].]]\nFollowing the United States entry into World War II, Harrison was promoted to the temporary rank of Colonel on December 11, 1941, just four days after Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. He was appointed Deputy Chief of Strategy & Policy Group, War Plans Division, [[War Department General Staff]] and also was given additional duty at General [[George C. Marshall]]'s Committee on Allocation of Responsibilities which was given the job of figuring out a reorganization of the Army High command. For his service in this capacity, Harrison was promoted to the temporary rank of Brigadier general on June 26, 1942.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref><ref name=\"William K.

Parker Jr.]] as Assistant Division Commander. Harrison then participated in the training of replacements for units serving overseas and suffered minor injury on an obstacle course in December 1942. While recuperating, he received a telephone call from Major general [[Leland S. Hobbs]], commanding general, [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Infantry Division]], informing him about his new assignment with Hobbs division.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name=\"Arlington\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison was replaced by Brigadier general [[John K. Rice]] and appointed Assistant Division Commander under Hobbs, who tasked him with organization of the 30th Infantry Division's training at [[Camp Blanding]], [[Florida]]. Harrison and Hobbs had know each other from [[West Point]], where Hobbs was a member of Class 1915 and also were in the same class at the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Army Command and General Staff School]] in 1937.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nBilly Harrison had almost no respect for Hobbs as a leader of the troops. From Harrison's point of view, Hobbs violated every principle of leadership except one: He demanded obedience and gave it to his superiors. But in almost every other aspects - from training and disciplining men to planning battle operations in the field. In short, Harrison described Hobbs as being \"stricly a Barracks soldier\", who accustomed himself to applause.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref><ref name=\"William K. Harrison Jr. Papers - Army Center of Military History\"></ref>\n\nDespite this, Harrison remained loyal to Hobbs, who never received anything than support from his Assistant Division Commander. On the other hand, Harrison benefited from Hobbs's apparent weakness, when he had the opportunity to be with his men during the training and later in combat.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison participated in the training of his troops for the upcoming [[Tennessee Maneuver Area|Tennessee Maneuvers]] in September-November 1943, where 30th Division showed considerable alertness and skills. Following the maneuvers, the division moved to [[Camp Atterbury]], [[Indiana]], where it concentrated on preparation for movement overseas.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref><ref name=\"William K. Harrison Jr. Papers - Army Center of Military History\"></ref>\n\n===Overseas duty===\n\nHarrison led divisional advanced party overseas by the end of January 1944 and spent several next months with intensive training in [[England]]. The 30th Infantry Division departed for [[France]] in June that year and landed at [[Omaha Beach]], [[Normandy]] on June 11, 1944. Harrison participated in the combats at Vire-et-Taute Canal and on [[Vire River]] and quickly won the admiration of his troops by accompanying them on the front lines with [[M3 submachine gun]] in hand. He also spent a first night in France in the trench with combat troops.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name=\"NY Times\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nOn July 25, 1944, the 30th Infantry Division still participated in the combats near [[Saint-L\u00f4]], which it secured few days earlier. The Division was subsequently scheduled to participate in [[Operation Cobra]], an offensive with intention to advance into [[Brittany]]. The offensive was to begin with a major saturation bombing of the enemy with the troops then moving in afterward, but due to the inaccurate plane navigation, planes bombed erroneously their own men. More than 600 of the men had been hit, many killed, including lieutenant general [[Lesley J. McNair]], Commander of [[Army Ground Forces]].<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nEven Harrison's command group was located in the rear, he returned deliberately to the forward area shortly before the bombing began. He was thrown down by the blast of German Artillery fire, but was unharmed. Realizing that the success of the entire operation depended on the 30th Infantry Division carrying out its mission, Harrison began analyzing the situation and found out, that divisional [[Sherman tank]]s were totally disorganized and demoralized infantry was spread in the area. Moreover commanding officer of [[120th Infantry Regiment (United States)|120th Infantry Regiment]], Colonel [[Hammond D. Birks]] was located somewhere in the forward area and his jeep was knocked out.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n[[File:Brigadier General William K. Harrison, Jr. and Capt. John E. Kent, Co.

He took soldier with [[bazooka]] through the hedgerow and ordered him to attack the German tank nearby. The soldier had hit German tank several times, but panicked and ran into the open, where he was killed. Harrison crawled back and came upon four American tanks in a neighboring field, who were waiting out the enemy shelling with their hatches shut tight. He climbed on the commander's tank and forced the crew to open the hatch by beating the tank's turret, subsequently ordering the general attack, which was successful. For his heroism in action, he was decorated with [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], the second highest decorations of the United States military for valor in combat.<ref name=\"Valor awards for William K.

The Harrison's jeep was hit in the radiator and he was struck by enemy 75mm tank shell, hitting him to right shoulder, arm and leg. Harrison escaped from the damaged vehicle and hit the ditch, where he immediately dispatched his aide and driver to contact the next ranking officer in order that he might continue the advance. He did not mention his wounds, which were not visible due to his raincoat and crawled approximately 600 yards to the rear of the column in order to give further instructions for continuing the mission.<ref name=\"Musings of a Snickerdoodle\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison fainted momentarily due to his wounds, but refused to be evacuated until he had contacted his subordinates and instructed them in the continuation of the attack. By the time, General Hobbs arrived and following a discovery of Harrison's wounds, he ordered his evacuation. For bravery in action, he was decorated with [[Silver Star]] and also received [[Purple Heart]] for wounds, which he was most proud of.<ref name=\"Valor awards for William K.

The 30th Division then proceeded to the [[Netherlands]], where liberated town of [[Kerkrade]] on September 25, 1944 and advanced to [[Germany]], where took part in the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|combats on the Siegfried Line]] and subsequently in the [[Battle of Aachen|battle of heavily defended city of Aachen]] on October 2.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n[[File:William H.

Germany, February 1945.]]\nThe 30th Infantry Division was ordered for rest and refit to the rear by the end of November 1944 and transferred to the [[Ninth United States Army]] under lieutenant general [[William H. Simpson]]. Harrison was tasked by Simpson himself to conduct a refresher course for all infantry and artillery commanders in the Ninth United States Army, down to the battalion level. Harrison lectured the tactics employed by his command in taking of several towns and then took the entire class to the field trip to Sankt J\u00f6ris near Aachen, where artillery and tanks were set up to demonstrate how they had been used in the attack there.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison and 30th Division returned to the frontlines following the [[Battle of the Bulge|launch of German massive offensive in Ardennes]] on December 17, 1944 and participated in the combats in [[Malmedy massacre|Malmedy-Stavelot]] area. Hobbs tasked Harrison with the command of Task Force, consisting of [[119th Infantry Regiment (United States)|119th Infantry Regiment]], which later repelled German assault at [[La Gleize]]. Harrison and his task force destroyed or captured 178 enemy armored vehicles, including 39 tanks.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHe was out of action during January 1945, when he suffered an infection requiring surgery. Following his return at the beginning of February 1945, Harrison was visited by General [[William H.

Harrison took part in [[Operation Plunder|the crossing of Rhine River]] on March 23, and advanced further to Germany. After taking [[Hamelin]] and [[Braunschweig]] at the beginning of April 1945, the 30th Division Task Force under Harrison's command discovered two large groups of Hungarian Jews Women at [[Teutoburg Forest]].<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nOn April 13, 1945, Harrison participated in the efforts to save 2,400 prisoners from [[Neuengamme concentration camp]] subcamp at [[Farsleben]], whom they found locked in the train boxcars. The 30th Division then proceeded eastward and  halted its advanced on [[Elbe River]] at [[Grunewald]] linking up with Soviet forces.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nFor his service with 30th Infantry Division, Harrison received [[Legion of Merit]] and two [[Bronze Star Medal]]s.

He returned to the United States by the end of July and commanded the Second division during the preparations for combat deployment to the Pacific area.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"NY Times\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHe was relieved by Major general [[Edward M. Almond]] in September 1945 and assumed duty as his deputy and Assistant Division Commander. Due to [[surrender of Japan]], the deployment to Pacific was canceled and Harrison served with the 2nd Division at [[Camp Swift, Texas]] until April 1946. Harrison was then appointed Commanding general, [[Camp Carson]], [[Colorado]], where he was responsible for the demobilization of troops returning from war zones in Europe and Pacific.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name=\"NY Times\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nIn November 1946, Harrison was reversed to the peacetime rank of Colonel and ordered to [[Japan]], where he was attached to the General Headquarters of [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]] under General [[Douglas MacArthur]] as Executive for Administrative Affairs and Reparations. While in this capacity, he collaborated closely with General MacArthur and was responsible for the restoration of Japanese Economy as rapidly as possible.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Arlington\"></ref><ref name=\"NY Times\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHe remained in this capacity until January 1947, when he was appointed Commanding officer, General Headquarters, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers and also held additional duty as Executive officer of [[Far East Command (United States)|Far East Command]].<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison was promoted again to Brigadier general on January 24, 1948 and appointed Chief of Reparations Section at the headquarters of Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers and held this assignment until December 1948, when he was ordered back to the United States.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHe was subsequently appointed Chief of Armed Forces Information & Education Division, Department of the Army in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was promoted to Major general on March 11, 1949. While in this capacity, Harrison was responsible for the propaganda and university extension courses. He didn't like that job and following the outbreak of [[Korean War]], he applied to be assigned for a field command, hoping that Army Chief of Personnel, [[Matthew B. Ridgway]], who was his friend and West Point Classmate, would help him.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nUnfortunately, Ridgway couldn't help him at the time and offered him post as Commanding general, [[Fort Dix]], [[New Jersey]] with additional duty as commanding general, [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]]. Harrison accepted the offer in September 1950 and was responsible for the training of replacements for troops both in Europe and [[Korea]]. During sixteen-week training cycles, he had to transform young men into effective soldiers, but his methods were not met with understanding by some of the recruits parents and also with some unfavorable press.<ref name=\"NY Times\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nThe night marches and forced sixteen-mile marches with packs caused complaints to Congressmen. When the father of one recruit was invited to spend a week at the barracks with his son, he changed his mind and upon returning home, he wrote a second letter to the Editor of the newspaper, withdrawing all his criticism.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison also ordered total racial integration of living accommodations at Fort Dix. It should be mentioned that he was no racist, but neither a civil right activist. He did that because he needed his barracks to run in a more efficient manner. The barracks for white recruits were overcrowded and the ones for African American were half empty. The training was also racially integrated by Harrison.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref><ref name=\"William K.

After reporting to general Van Fleet, Harrison inspected every 8th Army's combat division located on the [[Jamestown Line]] (including American, [[British Commonwealth]], [[South Korea]]n or United Nations troops) from [[Yellow Sea]] to the [[Sea of Japan]].<ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHe gained awareness of the situation on the front, terrain and enemy positions, but there were no major military operations, just stalemate. The North Koreans and U.N. troops were located on the [[Jamestown Line]] and truce talks between [[United Nations]] and [[North Korea]] were already in effect. However general [[Matthew B. Ridgway]] was not satisfied with one member of the U.N. negotiation team, Major general [[Claude B. Ferenbaugh]] and replaced him with Harrison in January 1952.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nHarrison was attached to the U.S. team under Vice admiral [[C. Turner Joy]] and participated in the regular negotiations with North Korean and Chinese representatives at [[Panmunjon]]. The negotiations were ineffective and communists used the truce talks just for propaganda purposes and to strengthen their positions on the Jamestown Line. Admiral Joy was planning his own departure in mid-1952 and recommended Harrison as his replacement.<ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nRidgway agreed and announced the change of command to Washington, where it was confirmed in May 1952, when Harrison was appointed Senior Member of the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Korean Armistice Delegation]]. He also nominated Harrison for the temporary rank of lieutenant general, but [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Service Committee]] rejected the promotion.<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name=\"Arlington\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nIn May 1952, General [[Mark W. Clark]], another Harrison's West Point classmate and friend, succeeded Ridgway as Commander-in-Chief, [[United Nations Command|United Nations Command Korea]] and urged Harrison's promotion again. The Army Chief of Staff, General [[J. Lawton Collins]], who was also a West Point classmate of Harrison, convinced the committee and Harrison was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general on September 8, 1952.<ref name=\"Westpoint\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref><ref name=\"William K.

Clark]] and retained his assignment as Senior Member in the truce talks team. He participated in the regular meetings with North Korean delegation led by General [[Nam Il]] and had to handle more North Korean attempts to use truce talks as the platform for propaganda. He despised the communists, who he regarded with contempt as ''common criminals'' and for example in June 1952, he left the truce meeting, when he saw that the negotiation was without result, leaving North Korean General Nam Il flabbergasted.<ref name=\"NY Times\"></ref><ref name='A man under orders'></ref>\n\nIn September 1953, Harrison assumed duty as Chief of Staff and Deputy Commanding general, [[Far East Command (United States)|Far East Command]] under General [[Mark W.

Harrison served in the Far East until May 1954, when he returned to the United States for new assignment. For his service in [[Korea]] during the Armistice negotiations and later with Far East Forces, he was decorated with [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]]. [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] awarded him the [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath]].<ref name=\"generals.dk\"></ref><ref name=\"Valor awards for William K.

He attended many parades and banquets, where he featured as speaker and was given honorary degrees from the [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] in [[Illinois]] and the [[Houghton College]] in [[New York (state)|New York]]. Harrison was also featured as speaker at [[Easter sunrise service]] at the famous [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl stadium]] in [[Pasadena, California]].\n\nHe then arrived to the [[Panama Canal Zone]] on June 16, 1954 and assumed duty as Commander-in-Chief, [[United States Southern Command|United States Caribbean Command]] with headquarters in [[Quarry Heights]]. His main task was the defense of the [[Panama Canal]] and its coast, which was divided into Atlantic and Pacific Sectors. Harrison arrived in a country with an unstable political situation, because a few months after his arrival, President of Panama, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rem\u00f3n Cantera]] was assassinated and his successor, [[Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Guizado]], was arrested for conspiracy and murder.\n\nHarrison participated in many ceremonies including the [[Inauguration]] of President [[Ernesto de la Guardia]] in October 1956 (as a member of the United States delegation). He also hosted President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and then-Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1955.\n\nHe instituted military training exercises, both amphibious and paratroop, in the Canal Zone and forces came from the United States. Harrison intended to demonstrate to Panama's neighbors the capabilities of the United States Army. Harrison was succeeded by lieutenant general [[Robert M.

In the piece, Barry, the former South Asia Bureau Chief in New Delhi, tells the story of how she became friends with Ali \"Cyrus\" Raza. He had first allowed her to visit his family home in the spring of 2016. She explained, \"Every few years, the family agreed to admit a journalist, always a foreigner, to tell of their grievances against the state.\" However, \"the Oudh family refused, famously, to meet with Indians.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe friendship between Barry and Cyrus lasted for fifteen months. During this time, Cyrus was evasive about his family, and he talked about his sister as if she was alive. Eventually, Cyrus called Barry and admitted that his sister had died. He also stated that they should not talk again, although their correspondence was soon resumed. When the time came for her next assignment, Barry left India, and three months later, Cyrus died.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAt that point, Barry decided to investigate the origins of the family. She traveled to [[Lucknow]], the former home of the family. She found that the family's claim was widely rejected by locals of the town. She also tracked down a relative, known as Shahid, in Bradford, England, who had been sending [[Western Union]] payments to the family. He was the older brother of Cyrus, and he revealed that the real name of Cyrus was \"Mickey Butt.\" He and his wife stated that the family did not have royal lineage.

The relatives described Wilayat as a woman with severe mental health issues who had received [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electric shock therapy]]. They stated that she lied regarding her royal lineage. During the [[partition of India]], she had been forced to move from Lucknow to Pakistan, which she did not want to do. As a result, she decided to return to India. \n\nAs explained in the article, \"It was Partition that ruined his mother, set her on the course toward the ruined palace, Shahid had told me. 'We had to start all over again,' he said. In the early 1970s, still empty-handed, increasingly bizarre in her behavior, Wilayat announced to the world that she was the queen of Oudh, demanding the vast properties of a kingdom that no longer existed.

She works full-time at a laundromat and has held her job for many years. She often [[Self-harm|maims herself]] during times of great stress. Once, Carrie dreamed that Margaret had given herself a [[hysterectomy]] after battling [[Devil|the devil]].\n\nShe was born Margaret Brigham. Her father was killed in a gun battle, and she began attending a [[religious fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] church group to deal with the loss; she quickly became a religious fanatic. Her mother remarried a man named Harold Allison, but Margaret denounced them, believing that they were living in [[sin]].\n\nIn 1960, she met her soon-to-be husband, Ralph White. Margaret later tells Carrie she had sex with Ralph before marriage. She wanted to kill herself afterwards and fell down the stairs to induce a [[miscarriage]]. After they married, Ralph vowed that their indiscretions would never recur, but one night Ralph tried to seduce Margaret before she threw him out of the house. He returned drunk and had sex with her in a bizarre form of [[marital rape]] that Margaret both hated and enjoyed. This resulted in the conception of Carrie. In February 1963, seven months before Carrie's birth, Ralph was killed while working on a construction site (though it is mentioned in the novel that Ralph stopped Margaret from killing the infant Carrie when she started exhibiting her powers early in her life).\n\nMargaret gave [[childbirth|birth]] to Carrie while in her house, without medical assistance. Her relationship with her daughter was extremely abusive from the time Carrie was a baby. This deeply affected Carrie throughout the years, putting great strain on her by homeschooling her into becoming a part of her fundamentalist community. Whenever Margaret believed that Carrie had sinned by going to school, she would throw her in a specially decorated closet to pray for forgiveness (out of no fault of her own), usually leaving her there for several hours or even days as a punishment.\n\nMargaret believes that anything or everything is a sin and harbors extremely restrictive views on sexuality. She feels that only \"loose women\" develop breasts, or \"dirty pillows\" as she calls them; she feels that she herself developed breasts due to the way Carrie was conceived. When Carrie has her first menstrual cycle at the age of 16, Margaret refers to it as the 'Curse of Blood' and claims that it was brought on by some sort of sexual sin on Carrie's part. After berating Carrie, Margaret locks her in the \"prayer closet\" until it is time for bed.\n\nWhen Carrie is asked to the prom by Tommy Ross, Margaret initially forbids it, but Carrie insists on this last opportunity to fit in and reinforces her demand with her telekinetic power. Once Carrie makes her own dress, Margaret insists that they burn it and pray for forgiveness, disapproving of the fact that it shows cleavage. Carrie then uses her powers to push her mother out of the room.\n\nWhile waiting for Carrie to come home from the prom, Margaret loses all contact with reality, hiding a [[butcher knife]] beneath the folds of her dress. Once Carrie arrives home, having telekinetically destroyed the high school and everything else in the town after falling victim to a cruel prank, both are surprised to find out that they each intend to kill the other. Margaret stabs Carrie in her shoulder. Carrie kills her mother by telekinetically slowing down her heart to a stop; Margaret recites the [[Lord's Prayer|Lord's Prayer]] as she dies.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===1976 film===\nIn the [[Carrie (1976 film)|original film adaptation]] by [[Brian De Palma]], Margaret is portrayed by [[Piper Laurie]].\n\nMargaret claims that Ralph was carried away by the [[devil]], but Carrie says that he actually [[The Rage: Carrie 2#Plot|left her for another woman]]. As in the novel, Margaret reveals that she had sex with Ralph twice: once prior to marriage (after which she wanted to kill herself), and once more after they were married, when he was drunk and forced himself on her, leading to the conception of Carrie.\n\nUpon learning of her daughter's telekinetic abilities, Margaret becomes convinced that Carrie is a witch, and recalls [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:18 (\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\"), which interprets as charging her to purify Carrie by killing her. While Carrie is at the prom, Margaret snaps mentally; she is seen pacing in the kitchen, then beginning to chop a carrot with a butcher knife, and continuing to chop the cutting board even after the carrot rolls away. After Carrie returns home after unleashing her powers at the prom (killing almost everyone there), Margaret, who has lit thousands of candles all over the house, tells her about the night she was conceived by marital rape, then stabs her in the back with the butcher knife while leading her in the Lord's Prayer. As Carrie tries to crawl away, Margaret makes a cross motion with the knife and stalks her through the house with a delirious look in her eyes. She corners Carrie and raises the knife to strike again, but Carrie telekinetically flings various kitchen elements from the drawers at her, impaling her. Margaret dies in the same pose as the statue of [[Saint Sebastian]] in Carrie's \"prayer closet\".\n\nLaurie's performance in the original film earned her nominations for both the 1976 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture]].\n\n===2002 television film===\nIn the 2002 [[Carrie (television movie)|made-for-TV adaptation]], Margaret is portrayed by [[Patricia Clarkson]]. Her past is only briefly hinted at; the film begins with her giving birth to Carrie in bed at home. Her husband isn't mentioned. On prom night, Margaret tries once again to persuade Carrie not to attend, but is sent sliding out the door by Carrie's powers; Carrie warns her to \"watch your fingers\", preventing her from being harmed physically when the door slams shut. Margaret then leaves the house, and spies on her daughter as she leaves in a limo with Tommy, heading for the prom. Following Carrie's return from the massacre, Margaret steps into the bathroom while Carrie is still in the bathtub. She calls Carrie a witch for destroying the town and tries to drown her in the bathtub while reciting the \"bedtime prayer\". Carrie then kills Margaret by causing her heart to stop.\n\n===2013 film===\n[[Julianne Moore]] played Margaret in the [[Carrie (2013 film)|2013 adaptation of the novel]].<ref name=ABC2>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc2news.com/dpp/entertainment/celebrity/Chloe-Grace-Moretz-celebrates-16th-birthday-with-starstudded-bash_99943891|title=Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz celebrates 16th birthday with star-studded bash|website=[[WMAR-TV]]-[[ABC News]]|date=February 8, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002172250/http://www.abc2news.com/dpp/entertainment/celebrity/Chloe-Grace-Moretz-celebrates-16th-birthday-with-starstudded-bash_99943891 |archive-date=October 2, 2013}}</ref> This version of the character takes her self-harm to a new extreme, breaking her skin using sharp objects and scratching herself until she bleeds.

In Universe A, the universe in which [[Howard V. Hendrix|Hendrix's]] previous novel ''[[Better Angels (novel)|Better Angels]]'' occurs, the accident is avoided allowing 3 of the major characters in that novel to be born. However, in Universe A Prime the accident does occur and the resulting deaths prevent those characters from being born. The 3 characters are brothers Jiro and Seiji Ansel Yamaguchi, and their cousin John Drinan.\n\nYears later in 2032 the process of Jiro's [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], which occurs at the end of ''[[Better Angels (novel)|Better Angels]]'', results in John being thrown from Universe A to Universe A Prime. '''''Empty Cities of the Full Moon''''' takes place in Universe A Prime after this.\n\n===Year 2032 (pre-human extinction)===\nWhen John is thrown between universes he quickly discovers that there is no record of his existence. The trauma of this event causes John to lose himself in depression. After meeting Mark Fornash, John en-rolls himself in a clinical trial of an experimental artificial [[prion]] based cure for mental illness, created by Tomoko Fukuda.\n\nSoon a [[drums|drumming]] and [[dancing mania]] begins to sweep the globe, causing a large and increasing portion of the population to drop out of their societies. Due to his interest in [[shamanism]] Mark Fornash is the first person to recognize the manias as a single phenomenon patterned after [[shamanism|shamanistic]] practises, and to predict it progression from drumming and dancing to visions, [[shape-shifting]], soul-flying and death.\n\nThe story follows the progress of the disease through the view points of these characters, as well as: Simon Lingham, ex-husband of Tokomo, and [[World Health Organization]] investigator; Sister Vena, a [[nun]] in [[Kolkata|Calcuta]] who observes extreme stigmata in patients in last stages of the pandemic; Leira Losaba, a police lieutenant in [[Johannesburg]] who investigates a series of murders involving shape-shifted people; Cameron Spires, one of the survivors of the car accident at the beginning of the novel, an eccentric billionaire with interests in human longevity and long-term survival.\n\nAs the pandemic progresses Cameron eventually organizes a conference to pool research, which brings all of the major character together. The pandemic appears to be related to the Tokomo's prion's, but the extreme effects can not be explained. As madness and death consume the world, Cameron uses his enormous wealth to create a bolt-hole in the [[Bahamas]] and to bring all of the major characters to safety. However, before Cameron departs to his island he holds a final tele-conference with some powerful allies, who have died but been recorded in a powerful computer system. This system is the \"G\u00f6delian Non-standard Optimized Market Evolution Systems\" or GNOMES. This organization Tetragammaton and these characters (Dr. Vang, Michael Dalke, and Martin Kong) have appeared in previous [[Howard V. Hendrix|Hendrix]] novels involved in the long-term survival of humanity through the creation of [[mind-machine interface]]s. This conversation reveals that Tetragammaton, was involved in the creation of the pandemic but that it has gone out of control. Dalke and Kong claim that the GNOMES were ultimately responsible for creating the pandemic as a complete defence against extinction and by orders of mysterious entity the Allesseh. The Allesseh is a massive consciousness at the centre of the galaxy, described in [[Howard V. Hendrix|Hendrix]]'s novel [[Better Angels (novel)|Better Angels]].\n\n===Year 2065 (post-human extinction)===\n\nThe pandemic has resulted in the near-extinction of humanity. Some of the survivors were fully resistant to the pandemic and have remained human, called Oldfolk or Urfolk, and some were partially resistant have become Werfolk having some of the madness, drumming, dancing, and shape shifting of the pandemic. Over the past 30 years Cameron Spires has perfected a longevity treatment, created a dolphin-human hybrid species called the Merfolk, kept the islands strictly isolated from the Werfolk, prevented further research into the pandemic and maintained himself as the unquestioned 'founder-ruler'. This has driven all of the major characters, except Simon Lingham, back to the mainland in search of answers. Simon Lingham, leaves for the same reasons soon after the story begins.\n\nCameron's granddaughter Trillia Spires and her lover Ricardo, soon follow him when Ricardo is found to have signs of the plague, and exiled per Cameron's rules. They hope to catch up with Simon in [[New York City]] and to discover a cure for Ricardo. Their journey takes them up the [[United States|American]] [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]], encountering all of the major characters of the novel who are each dealing with the post-pandemic world in their own ways. Each character, except Leire who has become a Werfolk-hating warlord, either joins the group or offers some aid.\n\nBy the time the group reaches New York, Ricardo's symptoms are entering the final stages of the pandemic. Ricardo's plague induced vision lead them to where Simon has connected himself to GNOMES. Simon is learning from and changing the GNOMES. He reveals Cameron's involvement in not preventing the plague, and Cameron arrives with a security team, claiming that he engineered the plague so that he could re-make humanity in his image. However, Ricardo dies and transcends during this conflict preparing the way for John to return to his universe and transmitting full knowledge of the works of the pandemic to every human on the planet. This final knowledge will allow the three types of human, Urfolk, Werfolk, and Merfolk, to choose their own destinies and control the effects of the pandemic. The group exiles Cameron and returns to the Bahamas to begin the process of re-building their world.\n\n==Release details==\n*2001, [[United States|United States of America]], [[Penguin Putnam Inc.]] {{ISBN|0-441-00844-5}}, Pub August 7, 2001, [[Hardcover]]\n*2001, [[United States|United States of America]], [[Ace Trade]] {{ISBN|0-441-00937-9}}, Pub August 6, 2002, [[Paperback]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://trashotron.com/agony/reviews/hendrix-empty_cities.htm Agony Column] review by Rick Kleffel\n* [http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/emptycities.htm Infinity Plus] review by John Grant\n* [http://www.curledup.com/empty.htm Curled Up With a Good Book] review\n* [http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue229/books.html SciFi.com] review by D.

Nicole is sent to prison for her crimes and later released with the help of [[Anna DiMera]] ([[Leann Hunley]]).\n\nSeeing that Nicole is still attached to Sydney, EJ arranges for her to be a part of Sydney's life and live in the mansion leading him to propose to her in order for Nicole to be a \"mother figure\" to EJ's children. Nicole accepts leading her to start falling in love with him again. On their wedding day, EJ meets Nicole's sister Taylor ([[Natalia Livingston]]) and it is love at first sight.

Nicole gives birth to her stillborn son and seeing the opportunity she blames Jennifer in pushing her. A month later the truth comes out and seeing she is left with nothing, she tries to commit suicide but Rafe and Daniel step in just in time to stop her.\n\nNicole's first love, Eric Brady ([[Greg Vaughan]]), returns to Salem as a priest. He offers her a job as his secretary at the church, which Nicole accepts. As the two continue working together, Nicole's old feelings for Eric resurface. Knowing that he is a priest and cannot be with her, Nicole aches about not being with him. In June 2013, Eric is drugged and seduced by [[Kristen DiMera]]. Due to coincidences that happened that night, such as Nicole finding a delirious Eric in his hotel room shortly after Kristen leaves, Eric is led to believe that it was Nicole who raped him. He confronts her about the matter. While Nicole admits her feelings towards him during the confrontation, she repeatedly denies any wrongdoing. Eric does not believe her, concluding that Nicole acted on her feelings. Dismayed by Eric's false accusation, Nicole does not want to have anything to do with Eric. After Eric is suspended from the priesthood due to the sex scandal, Nicole forgives him, and together with Daniel, they work together to prove Eric's innocence. Knowing that Eric would deny her help due to her feelings for him, Nicole fabricates a fake romance with Daniel, assuring Eric she is over him. The lie shocks both Daniel and Eric. Daniel is initially reluctant at first, as Nicole had made up the lie before informing him, but he agrees to play along, blindsiding Eric. Since finding out about Nicole's new romance, Eric begins to have dreams about Nicole and is unsure how he feels about her. As Nicole and Eric begin spending more time together to clear his name, Eric's old feelings for Nicole resurface. This becomes especially apparent after Nicole's photo shoot, when Eric reminisces about an old photo shoot with Nicole during her modeling days with Countess Wilhelmina. Nicole and Eric's relationship becomes more mutual, leaving both of them confused and unsure how to react. On January 13, 2014, Nicole and Eric are kidnapped by Kristen's potion doctor, as the two have gotten too close to the truth about the night Eric was drugged. The doctor tied them together in the basement of Daniel's apartment complex. He initially was going to wipe their memories with his drugs, but instead opens a gas line in the basement and leaves Nicole and Eric to die, either by asphyxiation or an eventual explosion. It is in this dire situation Eric confesses he loves Nicole. She was engaged to Eric briefly but they broke up and now she is currently engaged to Daniel. Sadly, on New Year's Eve of 2015, Brady, his [[stepsibling|stepbrother]] Eric, Jennifer Horton, and Daniel are involved in a tragic car accident due to Eric driving drunk. The accident leaves Daniel brain dead, and Brady in need of a heart transplant. With Maggie's permission, Daniel is taken off of life support and his heart is donated to Brady. Eric is later sent to prison for causing Daniel's death, leaving Nicole heartbroken. In 2016, [[Chloe Lane]] attempts a second surrogacy for Nicole after a failed first attempt. In a snowstorm with Chloe, Nicole unknowingly delivers her own child conceived through [[in vitro fertilisation]]. Chloe tells her to name the baby before losing consciousness. Nicole names the baby girl Holly and later learns the child belongs to her and the late [[Daniel Jonas]]. This makes [[Maggie Horton]] the baby's paternal grandmother.\n\nNicole was in a relationship with [[Days of Our Lives characters (2010s)#Deimos Kiriakis|Deimos Kiriakis]] and then they were engaged and then she dumped him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/days/content/scoop/spoilers/2013/131230.php|title=The Scoop: DAYS preview for the week of December 30, 2013 - Days of our Lives @ soapcentral.com|work=[[SoapCentral]]|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}</ref> In October 2018, it is revealed that Nicole has been living in Nashville Tennessee at [[Sarah Horton]] ([[Linsey Godfrey]])'s old apartment with Holly. When Eric arrives to confess his love for her, she reveals she is married to Xander, who is blackmailing her with a recording that reveals her as Deimos' killer. When Nicole escapes Xander's hold, she travels to a warehouse to meet with Eric; there, she becomes trapped, and is revealed to have died following an explosion. When she suddenly reappears, she is revealed to be Kristen in a mask and wig, using Nicole's identity to try and seduce Brady into taking her back. She also tries to steal the DiMera family business from under her brother Stefan, which fails when Stefan blocks her from regaining ownership of Nicole's former company. Xander subsequently steals the mask after getting fed up with Kristen, who resorts to posing as her doppelg\u00e4nger until she can get it back. Her plan ultimately backfired after she was exposed at John and Marlena's anniversary party.\n\nIn September 2019, Nicole is discovered alive and living in Chicago. It is revealed that she willingly let Kristen steal her identity to protect Holly. Eric swears to bring them both back home now that Kristen's scheme has unraveled.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/nicole.php Nicole Walker at SoapCentral.com]\n* [http://www.soaps.com/daysofourlives/cast/642/Nicole_Walker Nicole Walker at Soaps.com]\n* [http://www.nbc.com/Days_of_our_Lives/about/quick_guide/nicole.shtml Nicole Walker at nbc.com/days of our lives]\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walker, Nicole}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional pornographic film actors]]\n[[Category:Fictional Hispanic and Latino American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional reporters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1998]]\n[[Category:Fictional sexual assault victims]]\n[[Category:Fictional child sexual abuse victims]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{about||the American writer|Nicole Walker (writer)|the English actress|Nicola Walker}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{short description|Fictional character from Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Use American English|date=November 2015}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name         = Nicole Walker\n| series       = Days of our Lives\n| portrayer    = [[Arianne Zucker]]\n| years          = {{Flatlist |\n* 1998\u20132006\n* 2008\u2013present\n}}\n| first        = {{Start date|1998|2|27}}\n| last         = \n| cause        =\n| creator      = [[Sally Sussman Morina]]\n| introducer   = {{Plain list|\n* [[Ken Corday]] and [[Tom Langan]] (1998)\n* Ken Corday and [[Edward J.

A month later the truth comes out and seeing she is left with nothing, she tries to commit suicide but Rafe and Daniel step in just in time to stop her.\n\nNicole's first love, Eric Brady ([[Greg Vaughan]]), returns to Salem as a priest. He offers her a job as his secretary at the church, which Nicole accepts. As the two continue working together, Nicole's old feelings for Eric resurface. Knowing that he is a priest and cannot be with her, Nicole aches about not being with him. In June 2013, Eric is drugged and seduced by [[Kristen DiMera]]. Due to coincidences that happened that night, such as Nicole finding a delirious Eric in his hotel room shortly after Kristen leaves, Eric is led to believe that it was Nicole who raped him. He confronts her about the matter. While Nicole admits her feelings towards him during the confrontation, she repeatedly denies any wrongdoing. Eric does not believe her, concluding that Nicole acted on her feelings. Dismayed by Eric's false accusation, Nicole does not want to have anything to do with Eric. After Eric is suspended from the priesthood due to the sex scandal, Nicole forgives him, and together with Daniel, they work together to prove Eric's innocence. Knowing that Eric would deny her help due to her feelings for him, Nicole fabricates a fake romance with Daniel, assuring Eric she is over him. The lie shocks both Daniel and Eric. Daniel is initially reluctant at first, as Nicole had made up the lie before informing him, but he agrees to play along, blindsiding Eric. Since finding out about Nicole's new romance, Eric begins to have dreams about Nicole and is unsure how he feels about her. As Nicole and Eric begin spending more time together to clear his name, Eric's old feelings for Nicole resurface. This becomes especially apparent after Nicole's photo shoot, when Eric reminisces about an old photo shoot with Nicole during her modeling days with Countess Wilhelmina. Nicole and Eric's relationship becomes more mutual, leaving both of them confused and unsure how to react. On January 13, 2014, Nicole and Eric are kidnapped by Kristen's potion doctor, as the two have gotten too close to the truth about the night Eric was drugged. The doctor tied them together in the basement of Daniel's apartment complex. He initially was going to wipe their memories with his drugs, but instead opens a gas line in the basement and leaves Nicole and Eric to die, either by asphyxiation or an eventual explosion. It is in this dire situation Eric confesses he loves Nicole. She was engaged to Eric briefly but they broke up and now she is currently engaged to Daniel. Sadly, on New Year's Eve of 2015, Brady, his [[stepsibling|stepbrother]] Eric, Jennifer Horton, and Daniel are involved in a tragic car accident due to Eric driving drunk. The accident leaves Daniel brain dead, and Brady in need of a heart transplant. With Maggie's permission, Daniel is taken off of life support and his heart is donated to Brady. Eric is later sent to prison for causing Daniel's death, leaving Nicole heartbroken. In 2016, [[Chloe Lane]] attempts a second surrogacy for Nicole after a failed first attempt. In a snowstorm with Chloe, Nicole unknowingly delivers her own child conceived through [[in vitro fertilisation]]. Chloe tells her to name the baby before losing consciousness. Nicole names the baby girl Holly and later learns the child belongs to her and the late [[Daniel Jonas]]. This makes [[Maggie Horton]] the baby\u2019s paternal grandmother.\n\nNicole was in a relationship with [[Days of Our Lives characters (2010s)#Deimos Kiriakis|Deimos Kiriakis]] and then they were engaged and then she dumped him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/days/content/scoop/spoilers/2013/131230.php|title=The Scoop: DAYS preview for the week of December 30, 2013 - Days of our Lives @ soapcentral.com|work=[[SoapCentral]]|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}</ref> In October 2018, it is revealed that Nicole has been living in Nashville Tennessee at [[Sarah Horton]] ([[Linsey Godfrey]])'s old apartment with Holly. When Eric arrives to confess his love for her, she reveals she is married to Xander, who is blackmailing her with a recording that reveals her as Deimos' killer. When Nicole escapes Xander's hold, she travels to a warehouse to meet with Eric; there, she becomes trapped, and is revealed to have died following an explosion. When she suddenly reappears, she is revealed to be Kristen in a mask and wig, using Nicole's identity to try and seduce Brady into taking her back. She also tries to steal the DiMera family business from under her brother Stefan, which fails when Stefan blocks her from regaining ownership of Nicole's former company. Xander subsequently steals the mask after getting fed up with Kristen, who resorts to posing as her doppelg\u00e4nger until she can get it back. Her plan ultimately backfired after she was exposed at John and Marlena's anniversary party.\n\nIn September 2019, Nicole is discovered alive and living in Chicago. It is revealed that she willingly let Kristen steal her identity to protect Holly. Eric swears to bring them both back home now that Kristen's scheme has unraveled.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/nicole.php Nicole Walker at SoapCentral.com]\n* [http://www.soaps.com/daysofourlives/cast/642/Nicole_Walker Nicole Walker at Soaps.com]\n* [http://www.nbc.com/Days_of_our_Lives/about/quick_guide/nicole.shtml Nicole Walker at nbc.com/days of our lives]\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walker, Nicole}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional pornographic film actors]]\n[[Category:Fictional Hispanic and Latino American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional reporters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1998]]\n[[Category:Fictional sexual assault victims]]\n[[Category:Fictional child sexual abuse victims]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e2008\u2013present:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Walker"}
