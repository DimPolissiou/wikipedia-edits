It is an involuntary, [[striated muscle tissue|striated]] muscle that constitutes the main tissue of the walls of the [[heart]]. The myocardium forms a thick middle layer between the outer layer of the heart wall (the [[epicardium]]) and the inner layer (the [[endocardium]]), with blood supplied via the [[coronary circulation]].  It is composed of individual heart muscle cells ([[cardiac muscle cell|cardiomyocytes]]) joined together by [[intercalated disc]]s, encased by [[collagen]] fibers and other substances that form the [[extracellular matrix]].\n\n<!-- Physiology of how it works -->\nCardiac muscle [[Muscle contraction|contracts]] in a similar manner to [[skeletal muscle]], although with some important differences.  Electrical stimulation in the form of an [[Cardiac action potential|action potential]]  triggers the release of calcium from the cell's internal calcium store, the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]].  The rise in calcium causes the cell's [[myofilament]]s to slide past each other in a process called [[excitation contraction coupling]].\n\n<!-- Pathophysiology and its consequences -->\nDiseases of the heart muscle are of major importance.  These include conditions caused by a restricted blood supply to the muscle including [[angina]] pectoris and [[myocardial infarction]], and other heart muscle diseases known as [[Cardiomyopathy|cardiomyopathies]].\n\n== Structure ==\n=== Gross anatomy ===\n{{See|Heart#Structure}}\n[[File:Blausen 0470 HeartWall.png|thumb|231x231px|3D rendering showing thick myocardium within the heart wall.]]\n[[File:Cardiac Muscle.png|thumb|Cardiac muscle]]\nCardiac muscle tissue or myocardium forms the bulk of the heart. The heart wall is a three-layered structure with a thick layer of myocardium sandwiched between the inner [[endocardium]] and the outer [[Pericardium|epicardium]] (also known as the visceral pericardium). The inner endocardium lines the cardiac chambers covers the [[Heart valve|cardiac valves]], and joins with the [[endothelium]] that lines the blood vessels that connect to the heart. On the outer aspect of the myocardium is the [[Pericardium|epicardium]] which forms part of the pericardium, the sack that surrounds, protects, and lubricates the heart.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Last's anatomy : regional and applied.|last=S.|first=Sinnatamby, Chummy|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone|others=Last, R.

The sheets of muscle that wrap around the left ventricle closest to the endocardium are oriented perpendicularly to those closest to the epicardium.  When these sheets contract in a coordinated manner they allow the ventricle to squeeze in several directions simultaneously \u2013 longitudinally (becoming shorter from apex to base), radially (becoming narrower from side to side), and with a twisting motion (similar to wringing out a damp cloth) to squeeze the maximum possible amount of blood out of the heart with each heartbeat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=St\u00f6hr|first=Eric J.|last2=Shave|first2=Rob E.|last3=Baggish|first3=Aaron L.|last4=Weiner|first4=Rory B.|date=2016-09-01|title=Left ventricular twist mechanics in the context of normal physiology and cardiovascular disease: a review of studies using speckle tracking echocardiography|journal=American Journal of Physiology.

Blood is then drained away by the [[Coronary circulation|coronary veins]] into the [[right atrium]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Histology ===\nWhen looked at microscopically, cardiac muscle can be likened to the wall of a house. Most of the wall is taken up by bricks, which in cardiac muscle are individual [[cardiac muscle cell]]s or cardiomyocytes. The mortar which surrounds the bricks is known as the [[extracellular matrix]], produced by supporting cells known as [[fibroblast]]s. In the same way that the walls of a house contain electrical wires and plumbing, cardiac muscle also contains specialized cells for conducting electrical signals rapidly ([[Purkinje fibers|the cardiac conduction system]]), and blood vessels to bring nutrients to the muscle cells and take away waste products (the [[coronary arteries]], [[Coronary circulation|veins]] and [[capillary]] network).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Human histology|last=(Pathologist)|first=Stevens, Alan|date=1997|publisher=Mosby|others=Lowe, J.

Each cell contains [[myofibril]]s, specialized protein fibers that slide past each other.  These are organized into [[sarcomere]]s, the fundamental contractile units of muscle cells.  The regular organization of myofibrils into sarcomeres gives cardiac muscle cells a striped or [[Striated muscle tissue|striated]] appearance when looked at through a microscope, similar to skeletal muscle. These striations are caused by lighter [[I bands]] composed mainly of a protein called actin, and darker [[Sarcomere|A bands]] composed mainly of myosin.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCardiomyocytes contain [[T-tubule]]s, pouches of membrane that run from the surface to the cell's interior which help to improve the efficiency of contraction.  The majority of these cells contain only one [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] (although they may have as many as four), unlike skeletal muscle cells which typically contain many nuclei.

The discs are responsible mainly for force transmission during muscle contraction.  Intercalated discs consist of three different types of cell-cell junctions: the actin filament anchoring [[adherens junctions]], the intermediate filament anchoring [[desmosomes]], and [[gap junctions]]. They allow action potentials to spread between cardiac cells by permitting the passage of ions between cells, producing depolarization of the heart muscle. However, novel molecular biological and comprehensive studies unequivocally showed that intercalated discs predominantly consist of mixed-type adhering junctions named ''[[area composita]]'' (pl.

Following injury, fibroblasts can become activated and turn into [[myofibroblast]]s \u2013 cells which exhibit behaviour somewhere between a fibroblast (generating extracellular matrix) and a [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle cell]] (ability to contract).

Cardiomyocytes are linked to the basement membrane via specialised [[glycoprotein]]s called [[integrin]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horn|first=Margaux A.|last2=Trafford|first2=Andrew W.|date=April 2016|title=Aging and the cardiac collagen matrix: Novel mediators of fibrotic remodelling|journal=Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology|volume=93|pages=175\u2013185|doi=10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.005|issn=1095-8584|pmc=4945757|pmid=26578393}}</ref>\n\n== Physiology ==\n[[File:A single cardiomyocyte beating, five days after purification from cell culture.ogv|thumb|An isolated cardiac muscle cell, beating]]\n{{Main|Excitation-contraction coupling}}\nThe physiology of cardiac muscle shares many similarities with that of [[skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscle]].  The primary function of both muscle types is to contract, and in both cases, a contraction begins with a characteristic flow of [[ion]]s across the [[cell membrane]] known as an [[Cardiac action potential|action potential]].  The action potential subsequently triggers muscle contraction by increasing the concentration of [[calcium]] within the cytosol.\n\nHowever, the mechanism by which calcium concentrations within the cytosol rise differ between skeletal and cardiac muscle.  In cardiac muscle, the action potential comprises an inward flow of both sodium and calcium ions.  The flow of sodium ions is rapid but very short-lived, while the flow of calcium is sustained and gives the plateau phase characteristic of cardiac muscle action potentials.  The comparatively small flow of calcium through the [[L-type calcium channel]]s triggers a much larger release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in a phenomenon known as  [[calcium-induced calcium release]].  In contrast, in skeletal muscle, minimal calcium flows into the cell during action potential and instead the sarcoplasmic reticulum in these cells is directly coupled to the surface membrane.  This difference can be illustrated by the observation that cardiac muscle fibers require calcium to be present in the solution surrounding the cell to contract, while skeletal muscle fibers will contract without extracellular calcium.\n\nDuring contraction of a cardiac muscle cell, the long protein [[myofilament]]s oriented along the length of the cell slide over each other in what is known as the [[Sliding filament theory|sliding filament hypothesis]].  There are two kinds of myofilaments, thick filaments composed of the protein [[myosin]], and thin filaments composed of the proteins [[actin]], [[troponin]] and [[tropomyosin]].  As the thick and thin filaments slide past each other the cell becomes shorter and fatter.  In a mechanism known as [[Muscle contraction#crossbridge cycling|crossbridge cycling]], calcium ions bind to the protein troponin, which along with tropomyosin then uncover key binding sites on actin.  Myosin, in the thick filament, can then bind to actin, pulling the thick filaments along the thin filaments.  When the concentration of calcium within the cell falls, troponin and tropomyosin once again cover the binding sites on actin, causing the cell to relax.\n\n=== Regeneration ===\n[[File:Dogcardiacmuscle400.jpg|thumb|250px|Dog cardiac muscle (400X)]]\nUntil recently, it was commonly believed that cardiac muscle cells could not be regenerated.

Cardiomyocytes are linked to the basement membrane via specialised [[glycoprotein]]s called [[integrin]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horn|first=Margaux A.|last2=Trafford|first2=Andrew W.|date=April 2016|title=Aging and the cardiac collagen matrix: Novel mediators of fibrotic remodelling|journal=Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology|volume=93|pages=175\u2013185|doi=10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.005|issn=1095-8584|pmc=4945757|pmid=26578393}}</ref>\n\n== Physiology ==\n[[File:A single cardiomyocyte beating, five days after purification from cell culture.ogv|thumb|An isolated cardiac muscle cell, beating]]\n{{Main|Excitation-contraction coupling}}\nThe physiology of cardiac muscle shares many similarities with that of [[skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscle]].  The primary function of both muscle types is to contract, and in both cases, a contraction begins with a characteristic flow of [[ion]]s across the [[cell membrane]] known as an [[Cardiac action potential|action potential]].  The action potential subsequently triggers muscle contraction by increasing the concentration of [[calcium]] within the cytosol.\n\nHowever, the mechanism by which calcium concentrations within the cytosol rise differ between skeletal and cardiac muscle.  In cardiac muscle, the action potential comprises an inward flow of both sodium and calcium ions.  The flow of sodium ions is rapid but very short-lived, while the flow of calcium is sustained and gives the plateau phase characteristic of cardiac muscle action potentials.  The comparatively small flow of calcium through the [[L-type calcium channel]]s triggers a much larger release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in a phenomenon known as  [[calcium-induced calcium release]].  In contrast, in skeletal muscle, minimal calcium flows into the cell during action potential and instead the sarcoplasmic reticulum in these cells is directly coupled to the surface membrane.  This difference can be illustrated by the observation that cardiac muscle fibers require calcium to be present in the solution surrounding the cell to contract, while skeletal muscle fibers will contract without extracellular calcium.\n\nDuring contraction of a cardiac muscle cell, the long protein [[myofilament]]s oriented along the length of the cell slide over each other in what is known as the [[Sliding filament theory|sliding filament hypothesis]].  There are two kinds of myofilaments, thick filaments composed of the protein [[myosin]], and thin filaments composed of the proteins [[actin]], [[troponin]] and [[tropomyosin]].  As the thick and thin filaments slide past each other the cell becomes shorter and fatter.  In a mechanism known as [[Muscle contraction#crossbridge cycling|crossbridge cycling]], calcium ions bind to the protein troponin, which along with tropomyosin then uncover key binding sites on actin.  Myosin, in the thick filament, can then bind to actin, pulling the thick filaments along the thin filaments.  When the concentration of calcium within the cell falls, troponin and tropomyosin once again cover the binding sites on actin, causing the cell to relax.\n\n=== Regeneration ===\n[[File:Dogcardiacmuscle400.jpg|thumb|250px|Dog cardiac muscle (400X)]]\nUntil recently, it was commonly believed that cardiac muscle cells could not be regenerated.

The company was formed to construct a route from [[London]] to [[Dover]]. Branch lines were later opened to [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Hastings]], [[Canterbury]] and other places in Kent. The SER absorbed or leased other railways, some older than itself, including the [[London and Greenwich Railway]] and the [[Canterbury and Whitstable Railway]]. Most of the company's routes were in [[Kent]], eastern [[Sussex]] and the London suburbs, with a long cross-country route from {{stnlnk|Redhill}} in Surrey to [[Reading, Berkshire]].\n\nMuch of the company's early history saw attempts at expansion and feuding with its neighbours; the [[London Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LBSCR) in the west and the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LCDR) to the north-east. However, in 1899 the SER agreed with the LCDR to share operation of the two railways, work them as a single system (marketed as the [[South Eastern and Chatham Railway]]) and pool receipts: but it was not a full amalgamation. The SER and LCDR remained separate companies until becoming constituents of the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] on 1 January 1923.\n\n==Origins of the company==\nThere had been proposals for a railway between London and Dover in 1825, 1832 and 1835, but they came to nothing due to opposition from landowners or the difficulties of bridging the [[River Medway]] near its mouth.<ref>Sekon (1895), pp.2-3.</ref> On 21 June 1836, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed a [[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Private Act]] (6 Wm.IV., cap.75) incorporating the ''South Eastern and Dover Railway,'' which shortly afterwards changed to the South Eastern Railway.<ref>Bradshaw (1867), p.305.</ref>\n\n===Choice of route from London to Dover===\n\n{{main|South Eastern Main Line}}\n\nAt the time of inauguration there were two potential rail pathways south from London, and the  [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] had said no further pathways would be permitted.<ref>Sekon (1895), p.3.</ref> The SER therefore considered routes to Dover from the proposed [[London and Southampton Railway]] line at [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], or from the existing [[London and Greenwich Railway]] (L&GR) at Greenwich. The former left London in the wrong direction and then on a roundabout route. The latter provided a useful way for a northern route via [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], and [[Canterbury]], except that lengthening the line beyond Greenwich was blocked by opposition from the [[Admiralty]], and this route would involve tunnelling through the [[North Downs]].\n\nThe engineer of the new line, [[William Cubitt]], was also engineer of the [[London and Croydon Railway]] (L&CR), which planned to use L&GR lines as far as Corbett's Lane in [[Bermondsey]] before turning south towards [[Croydon]]. A new connection on this line near to [[Norwood Junction railway station|Norwood]] could provide access to a southerly route to Dover via [[Tonbridge]], [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] and [[Folkestone]]. This was less direct than the northerly route but passed through easier country. It involved one significant {{convert|1387|yd|m|adj=on}} tunnel through the [[Shakespeare Cliff Halt railway station|Shakespeare Cliff]] near Dover. This was the route first chosen by the SER at its inauguration.\n\nDuring Parliamentary discussions on the proposed route of the [[London and Brighton Railway]] (L&BR) during 1837, pressure was put on the SER to divert its proposed route so it could also share the L&BR mainline between [[Norwood Junction railway station|Jolly Sailor (Norwood)]] and [[Earlswood Common]], and then travel eastwards to [[Tonbridge]]. Under the scheme proposed by Parliament, the railway from Croydon to [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] would be built by the L&BR but the SER would have the right to refund half the construction costs and own that part of the line between [[Merstham]] and Redhill. The SER gave way to this proposal as it reduced the construction costs, although it resulted in a route {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} longer than by road, running south for {{convert|14.5|mi|km|0}} and then turning east. It also meant that its trains from [[London Bridge railway station|London Bridge]] passed over the lines of three other companies: the L&GR to Corbett's Lane Junction, the L&CR as far as 'Jolly Sailor', and the L&BR to Merstham.<ref>White (1961), pp.26-7.</ref>\n\n==Construction of the Main Line==\n\nConstruction began in 1838 at several places simultaneously, and the Shakespeare Tunnel was complete by May 1841 . The L&BR line to Redhill opened on 12 July 1841 and the SER line from [[Redhill to Tonbridge Line|Redhill to Tonbridge]] on 26 May 1842,<ref name=\"Bradley 1963, p.2\">Bradley (1963), p.2.</ref> when SER train services began.<ref>White (1961), pp.28.</ref> The main line reached [[Ashford (Kent) railway station|Ashford]] on 1 December 1842; the outskirts of [[Folkestone]] by 28 June 1843; and [[Dover]] by 7 February 1844.<ref>White (1961), p.30.</ref>  On the same day the SER offered to lease the L&BR for 21 years at \u00a3100,000 per year, but the offer was turned down.<ref>Turner (1977), p.185.</ref> Later that year, the SER refunded to the L&BR \u00a3430,000 and took ownership of the southern half of the [[Brighton Main Line|Croydon-Redhill line]].<ref>Turner (1977), p.171.</ref> Trains ran toll-free to both companies on this stretch but still had pay on the L&CR from [[Norwood Junction railway station]] to Corbett's Lane Junction, and the L&GR into London Bridge.\n\n===Folkestone and Dover Harbours===\nIn 1843, when the railway reached the edge of Folkestone, the company bought the silted and nearly derelict harbour, built by [[Thomas Telford]] in 1809, for \u00a318,000.<ref name=\"White 1961, p.55\">White (1961), p.55</ref> The SER dredged the harbour and, after a trial with the paddle steamer ''[[Water Witch (1835 steamer)|Water Witch]]'', which also demonstrated that a [[day trip|day excursion]] from London to [[Boulogne]] was feasible, arranged for a [[Packet (sea transport)|packet]] company to provide a ferry to Boulogne.<ref>{{cite news |title=A trip to Boulogne and back in one day|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fKYcoP0vZ0sC&pg=PA253#v=onepage |accessdate=16 September 2018 |work=The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal - Scientific and Railway Gazette |issue=Vol VI, July 1843 |location=London |page=253}}</ref> The following year it established the independent ''South Eastern & Continental Steam Packet Company'', which it absorbed in 1853.<ref name=\"White 1961, p.55\"/> James Broadbridge Monger was the Master of the \"Water Witch\" from 1839 to 1844. From 1844 on, he was Master of three vessels which steamed from Dover and Folkestone to Boulogne, Calais and Ostend with passengers and cargo: \"Lord Warden\", \"Princess Helena\" and \"Princess Maude\". In December 1848 it opened a steeply graded branch from the [[Folkestone East railway station|Folkestone station]] to the [[Folkestone Harbour railway station|harbour]].<ref>Bradley, (1963), p.2</ref>\n\nThe SER opened [[List of railway stations in Dover#Dover Town|Dover (later Dover Town)]] station on 7 February 1844. This was originally a terminus, but in 1860 the line was continued to Admiralty Pier. Thereafter the SER concentrated most of its resources into developing Folkestone Harbour, which became its principal base for cross-channel ferries.<ref>Body (1989), pp.96-7</ref> The company had complete control of Folkestone whereas at Dover it had to negotiate with both the [[Admiralty]] and the local town council, and the rail route from Boulogne to Paris was better developed than that from Calais.\n\nIn 1848 the SER served two steam ships a day between Folkestone and Boulogne, one a day between Dover and Calais, and one between Dover and Ostend.<ref name=\"Topham 1848 p.7\">Topham's railway time-table and guide (1848), p.7.</ref>\n\n===Bricklayers Arms Terminus===\nDuring 1843, before the main line was complete, the SER and the L&CR became anxious about the charges imposed by the L&GR for the use of the terminus at London Bridge and its approaches. Parliament had relaxed restrictions on new railways into London and so SER sought authority to construct a branch from Corbett's Lane to a new temporary passenger terminus and goods station at [[Bricklayers Arms railway station]], for use by both railways, removing the need to use the Greenwich Railway.<ref>Turner (1977) pp. 192-204.</ref> This opened 1 May 1844.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963, p.2\"/> According to [[Charles Vignoles]], 'the making of Bricklayers Arms station was a matter of compulsion in driving the Greenwich people to reasonable terms'.<ref>Dendy Marshall (1963) p. 32.</ref> Plans to extend from Bricklayers Arms to a new SER terminus at [[Hungerford Bridge]], nearer the centre of London, were rejected by Parliament.<ref>Board of Trade (1845).</ref> Similarly, a revised proposal to extend the line to [[Waterloo Road, London|Waterloo Road]] in 1846 was rejected by a committee of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].<ref>South Eastern Railway (1847).</ref>\n\nThe L&GR was nearly bankrupt in 1844 and the SER leased its line from 1 January 1845. It became the [[Greenwich Line|Greenwich branch]] of that railway.<ref>Turner (1977), pp.201\u20133</ref> Thereafter further developments were at London Bridge, and following a shunting accident during August 1850 which caused the collapse of a large part of the station roof,<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (25 August 1850)</ref> the SER closed Bricklayers Arms terminus to passenger traffic in 1852 converting it into a goods facility.\n\n==Secondary Main lines and Branch lines==\nOver the next two decades the SER system spread throughout Kent and Surrey, building lines to connect towns to its main line or acquiring those already in existence.\n\n=== Canterbury & Whitstable Railway ===\nIn 1844 the SER took over the bankrupt [[Canterbury and Whitstable Railway]], which had opened in 1830. This continued to be worked as an isolated line until the SER reached Canterbury from Ashford in 1846, with its line to [[Ashford to Ramsgate (via Canterbury West) line|Ramsgate]].<ref>White (1961), pp.16-8.</ref>\n\n===Medway Valley Line===\nThe first branch built by the SER was the [[Medway Valley Line]] on 24 September 1844,  from [[Paddock Wood]] to [[Maidstone]]. This was continued to [[Strood railway station]] on 18 June 1856.<ref>Bradley (1963) p.2.</ref>\n\n===Greenwich Line===\nLeasing the London and Greenwich Railway from 1 January 1845 gave the company control of its main line into London and provided a branch [[Greenwich Line|line]] to [[Greenwich railway station|Greenwich]]. Further eastward extension was not possible due to opposition from the [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]], but it was eventually opened in 1878 when the line joined the [[North Kent Line]] at [[Charlton railway station|Charlton]].\n\n===Tunbridge Wells and Hastings Line===\nA secondary [[Hastings Line|main line]] from [[Tonbridge]] to the outskirts of [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]] opened 20 September 1845. It was extended to [[Tunbridge Wells railway station|Tunbridge Wells Central]] on 25 November 1846.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963 p.2\">Bradley (1963) p.2</ref> By 1 September 1851 [[Hastings Line|the line]] had reached [[Robertsbridge]] and was extended to [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]], [[West St Leonards|Bopeep Junction]] and {{stnlink|Hastings}} on 1 February 1852. By this time Hastings had already been reached by the SER in a [[Marshlink Line|roundabout route]] from [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford]], which opened 13 February 1851.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963 pp.2-3\">Bradley (1963) pp.2-3.</ref> From this line was a short branch to [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye Harbour]].\n\n===Ramsgate, Margate and Deal Lines===\nDuring 1846 the SER opened another secondary [[Ashford to Ramsgate (via Canterbury West) line|main line]] from [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford]] to [[Ramsgate railway station|Ramsgate]] with a branch from there to [[Margate railway station|Margate]] on 1 December 1846.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963 p.2\"/> A further branch from this [[Kent Coast Line|line]] from [[Minster-in-Thanet|Minster]] to [[Deal railway station|Deal]] was opened 7 July 1847.\n\n===Gravesend and Strood Lines (North Kent)===\nAs the SER was prevented from extending its Greenwich line, it opened a secondary [[North Kent Line|main line]] from [[Lewisham railway station|Lewisham]] to [[Gravesend railway station|Gravesend]] and then to [[Strood railway station|Strood]] on the banks of the [[Medway]] on 30 July 1849.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963 pp.2-3\"/> The second half between Gravesend and Strood had been built as the [[Gravesend and Rochester canal]] and a single track railway had been added to form the Gravesend and Rochester Railway. The SER offered to buy the canal and railway in 1845 and filled in the canal and doubled the track.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963, p.37\">Bradley (1963), p.37.</ref> The first section (built by the SER) connected [[Woolwich railway station|Woolwich]] and [[Dartford railway station|Dartford]] to the railway network.\n\nIn 1852 a freight branch was constructed from this line at Charlton to the Thames at [[Angerstein's Wharf]], used for landing coal.<ref>Bradshaw (1867), p. 306.</ref> A line opened on 18 June 1856 up the Medway valley to [[Maidstone West railway station|Maidstone West]].\n\n==Early Management of the Company 1843-1855==\nIn September 1845 the SER appointed [[James Macgregor (MP)|James Macgregor]] (sometimes spelled McGregor or M'Gregor) to a new post combining the roles of Chairman and Managing Director. He exercised absolute power over the company for the next nine years, until he was ultimately forced to resign in 1854 and leave the Board in 1855.<ref>Gray (1990), p.21.</ref> Macgregor's lack of accountability, his opaque and at times dubious working methods led to a number of strategic errors in the building of new lines and in the company's relations with its neighbours, which would have an adverse impact on the company for decades to come.<ref>Greaves (2008), pp.103-4.</ref>\n\n===Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway===\nIn 1846 the SER supported the formation of the Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway, a scheme to build a line connecting the London to Brighton main line at Redhill with the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) main line at [[Reading Southern railway station|Reading]],<ref>Nock (1961), p.20.</ref> and agreed to operate its services. The [[North Downs Line|new line]] was completed 4 July 1849, and in 1852 was absorbed by SER.<ref>White (1961), p.127.</ref> Both the LB&SCR and [[London and South Western Railway]] (L&SWR) regarded this line as a significant incursion into their areas of operation. Likewise the acquisition of a line so remote from its main area of operation, and of doubtful profitability, caused heated discussion and the resignation of several directors, who felt that the company should rather secure its territory and develop services in Kent, as the LB&SCR was doing in Sussex.<ref>Heap & van Riemdijk (1980), p.70.</ref> It would also ultimately bring about Macgregor's downfall.<ref>White (1961), p.39.</ref> Nevertheless, in 1858 the GWR, L&SWR, and SER made a three-year agreement to share traffic and provide a connecting line between their stations at Reading.<ref>Kidner (1953), p.9.</ref> The line now (2015) forms part of the [[North Downs Line]].\n\n===Early relations with the London Brighton and South Coast Railway===\nDuring the first years, relations between the SER, L&CR and L&BR were cordial, with the companies pooling locomotives and forming a joint locomotive committee.<ref>Bradley (1963), p.7.</ref> However, all three considered they were disadvantaged by this arrangement and in 1845 gave notice of withdrawal. The merger of the L&BR and L&CR to form the LB&SCR in July 1846 created a powerful rival to the SER in areas of east Sussex and east Surrey not yet connected to the railway. Relations between the two companies were bad from the outset, especially at those sites where they shared facilities, such as the approaches to London Bridge, [[East Croydon railway station|East Croydon]], and [[Redhill railway station|Redhill]]. Also the SER had long wanted to build a line to [[Brighton]],<ref>Turner (1978), p.31.</ref> and the LB&SCR had inherited plans for a line into mid-Kent from the L&CR,<ref>Turner (1977), p.278.</ref> and from [[Bulverhythe railway station|Bulverhythe (St Leonards)]] to [[Ashford (Kent) railway station|Ashford]] via [[Hastings railway station|Hastings]] from the L&BR. Matters were further complicated in 1846 when the SER was empowered to build a line from its existing branch at [[Tunbridge Wells railway station|Tunbridge Wells]] to Hastings.<ref>Turner (1977), p.222.</ref>\n\nUnsuccessful discussions took place regarding a merger of the two companies, but eventually an agreement on 10 July 1848 (ratified in Parliament in 1849) abolished tolls for using each other's lines and prevented further eastward expansion by the LB&SCR beyond Hastings and westward further expansion by the SER.<ref>Turner (1978) pp.29-34.</ref> Under this agreement the LB&SCR, would share the line from Bulverhythe to Hastings and transfer to the SER its rights to build a line to Ashford but at the same time it retained the right to use the Bricklayers Arms branch and construct its own {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} goods depot on the site for a rent of one shilling (\u00a30.05) per year.<ref>Sekon (1895), p.13.</ref>\n\nThe 1848/9 agreement did not prevent further squabbling between the two companies, notably with the opening of the railway from Ashford to Hastings in 1851. The LB&SCR had originally sought to build it and then had attempted to delay its completion by the SER. In retaliation, the SER attempted to deny LB&SCR access to its station at Hastings. The matter was resolved in court in favour of the LB&SCR, but victory was short-lived as the following year the SER opened its lines from Tunbridge Wells, reducing the distance by rail to Hastings from London.<ref>Turner (1978), p.222.</ref>\n\n===Closing the Capital Account===\nMacgregor's greatest strategic mistake was his failure to address the concerns of the proposers of the [[East Kent Railway]], which ultimately led to the creation of an important rival in northern Kent and also for the Continental rail traffic.\n\nBetween 1844 and 1858, the SER had a monopoly of rail transport in Kent, but served the north of the county poorly. The SER [[North Kent Line|line]] from [[Strood railway station|Strood]] into London had opened in 1849. A plan to continue this line as far as [[Chilham]] where it would join the [[Ashford to Ramsgate (via Canterbury West) Line|Ashford to Canterbury Line]], was rejected by Parliament in 1847 due to financial considerations and never resurrected.<ref>White (1961) p.38.</ref> One group of SER directors were anxious to 'close the capital account' and build no more lines,<ref>Smiles (1905), pp.233-4.</ref> even though this might leave the field open to rival projects, as would later prove to be the case. As a result, there was no planned service to the north Kent towns to the east of the [[River Medway]]. Likewise SER routes to [[Margate]], [[Deal railway station|Deal]], and [[Canterbury]] were circuitous and other towns had no railway at all.  As a result of the railway's unwillingness to act, plans for an independent line from the SER station at [[Strood railway station|Strood]] to [[Faversham railway station|Faversham]] and [[Canterbury]] were made following a public meeting at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in 1850.<ref>Nock (1961), p.45.</ref>\n\n==Factionalism and bad management 1854-1866==\nFollowing Macgregor's resignation in 1854, there followed a decade of factionalism among the directors and equally poor management, described by [[Samuel Smiles]] the Company Secretary as 'not so much business as speech-making, that seemed to be the work of the Board.'<ref>Nock (1961), 48.</ref> It was during this period that there was a continuing failure to deal with underlying problems in the company, and its relationships with its neighbours together with further strategic errors which weakened what might otherwise have been a profitable enterprise.\n\n===East Kent and London Chatham & Dover Railways===\nThe [[East Kent Railway]] (EKR) from Strood to Canterbury, proposed in 1850 achieved parliamentary approval in 1853, and also for an extension to [[Dover]] in 1855, but it failed to secure [[running powers]] over the SER line into London: instead the SER reluctantly agreed to handle London traffic from the line.<ref>Nock (1961), p.46-7.</ref> Many SER directors were convinced the line would never be built, or would go bankrupt, and so took no interest in the scheme or in suggestions that the line should amalgamate with their railway.<ref>Smiles (1905), pp.235-6.</ref> They were proved wrong.\n\nIn 1856 the EKR again unsuccessfully sought running powers over the SER into London, and then obtained powers to build its own route via [[St Mary Cray railway station]] and [[Bromley South railway station]]. The EKR secured running powers over the LB&SCR lines into Pimlico and, after 1860, to [[London Victoria railway station|Victoria Station]].<ref>White (1961), pp.39-40.</ref> The EKR became the [[London Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LCDR) in 1859 and completed its rival route to Dover on 22 July 1861. By July 1863 the LCDR had its own independent route to Victoria, and in 1864 its own terminus on the edge of the [[City of London]] at [[Ludgate Hill railway station|Ludgate Hill]].<ref>Bradley (1979), pp. 4-6.</ref> For 36 years it would be an important competitor of the SER both for Continental and also local traffic in Kent.\n\nA further serious strategic mistake was the refusal of the SER to accept the terms of the contract for the cross-channel carriage of mails in 1862, as this stipulated the use of Dover rather than Folkestone.<ref>White (1961), p.57</ref> This enabled the [[London Chatham and Dover Railway]] which had only reached Dover in 1861 to secure the contract and the following year would give it leverage when it came to negotiating the Continental Traffic Agreement.\n\n===Continued Bad Relations with the LB&SCR===\nA new and protracted dispute with the LB&SCR took place between 1855 and 1862 over the [[Caterham Line|Caterham branch line]], which was built by an independent company in SER territory but connected to the railway network at the former LB&SCR station at [[Purley railway station|Purley]]. The SER refused to allow the line to be leased to the LB&SCR, which in turn refused to re-open its station, delayed opening of the line for a year, and made the Caterham company bankrupt. The SER took over the line in 1859, but the LB&SCR made life difficult for passengers to London.\n\nThe SER objected to the LB&SCR agreement with the [[East Kent Railway]] (later the [[London Chatham and Dover Railway]]) to provide access over its lines to its [[Pimlico]] station and later the jointly owned [[London Victoria railway station|Victoria]] station (see below), and also for handling that company's freight traffic at 'Willow Walk', (a part of the [[Bricklayers Arms railway station|Bricklayers Arms]] goods facility). Further difficulties between occurred at [[East Croydon railway station]] in 1862. With completion of the LB&SCR line to [[London Victoria station|Victoria station]], extra platforms were needed to accommodate the service. The platforms were treated by the LB&SCR as a separate station, named \"New Croydon\", with its own ticket office, and ran exclusively LB&SCR services. This enabled the railway to offer cheaper fares from New Croydon to London than the SER which only had use of East Croydon station.<ref>Turner (1978), pp. 240-1.</ref> The SER responded by gaining Parliamentary approval to build its own [[Addiscombe Line|line]] from [[New Beckenham railway station|New Beckenham]] to a new station at Croydon ([[Addiscombe railway station|Addiscombe Road]]), which opened 1 April 1864.\n\nRelations with the LB&SCR reached a low point in 1863, when the general manager and secretary had to report the history of relations between the companies since the agreement of 1848\u20139.<ref>Eborall and Smiles (1863).</ref> This set out the history although from the SER perspective.\n\nA branch from Lewisham to [[Beckenham]] opened in 1857, becoming the temporary terminus of the [[East Kent Railway]]. Following the dispute with the LB&SCR over New Croydon (see below) an extension of this [[Addiscombe Line|line]] to [[Addiscombe railway station|Addiscombe (Croydon)]] was opened in 1864.<ref>Bradley (1963) p. 3.</ref>\n\n===Continental Traffic Agreement (1863)===\nThe SER and the LCDR agreed to pool Continental traffic receipts between [[Hastings railway station|Hastings]] and [[Margate railway station|Margate]], together with local receipts to Dover and Folkestone. It then re-allocated them to a formula which gave the SER two-thirds of the receipts in 1863, gradually reducing to one half in 1872.<ref>Nock (1961), pp.57-8.</ref> The agreement appeared to unduly favour the LCDR, particularly after 1870. It did not prevent competition as the railways could claim additional funds from the pool if they carried more than their proportion of customers. Both companies sought to get round the agreement - the LCDR by establishing a Continental service from [[Queenborough]] on the [[Isle of Sheppey]], which was outside the scope of the agreement. Similarly, the SER built a local station at [[Folkestone West railway station|Shorncliffe]] on the edge of Folkestone, which it claimed was not part of Folkestone, and from which it charged lower fares.<ref>White (1961), p.47-9</ref>\n\nFollowing establishment of a LCDR service from Queenborough to [[Flushing, Netherlands]] in 1876, the SER was allowed to build the [[Hundred of Hoo Railway]] from its line near Gravesend to a new port on the across the Medway from Queenborough, called [[Port Victoria railway station|Port Victoria]]. The line opened in September 1882.\n\n===Improvements to the main line===\nIn 1860 the LCDR had a more direct route to Dover than the SER, and  both the company's rivals had access to a London terminus in the prosperous [[West End of London]] while the SER only had its terminal on the south side of the river [[Thames]] at [[London Bridge railway station|London Bridge]].\n\n====Charing Cross and Cannon Street Stations====\n[[File:Charing Cross station, before it was built over - geograph.org.uk - 1717686.jpg|thumb|[[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] before it was built over with offices with the later [[Southern Railway (UK)|SR]] initials retained.]]\nThe SER converted part of London Bridge to through platforms and extended to [[Blackfriars railway station|near Waterloo]], over [[Hungerford Bridge]] to a station at [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] which opened on 11 January 1864.<ref>Sekon (1893), p.26.</ref> When the LCDR built a line to [[Ludgate Hill railway station]] in the [[City of London]] in 1865, the SER built a new  [[Cannon Street Railway Bridge|bridge]] over the [[Thames]] and a city terminus at [[Cannon Street railway station]], which opened 1 September 1866.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963, p.3\">Bradley (1963), p.3.</ref> These extensions were difficult to operate and were congested at peak times.\n\nOn 16 August 1866 the SER agreed with the [[London and North Western Railway]] to build a joint line between [[Euston railway station]] and Charing Cross, with interchange of traffic,<ref>Bradshaw (1867), Appendix p.17.</ref> but the scheme was abandoned as a result of the 1867 financial crisis.\n\n====Orpington cut-off & Dartford Loop====\nThe SER therefore constructed the direct line via [[Sevenoaks]] to [[Tonbridge]]. It involved crossing the [[North Downs]] by summits and long tunnels at [[Knockholt]] and Sevenoaks. The latter was the longest tunnel in southern England at {{convert|3451|yd|m|0}}. This cut-off line, {{convert|24|mi|km|0}} long, reached [[Chislehurst]] on 1 July 1865, but took three more years to reach [[Orpington]] and Sevenoaks (2 March 1868). The new main line opened on 1 May 1868 when the line reached Tonbridge.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963, p.3\"/>\n\nConstruction of the main line provided the opportunity to build an improved [[Dartford Loop Line|route]] to [[Dartford railway station|Dartford]] from [[Hither Green railway station|Hither Green]] via [[Sidcup]]. This opened 1 September 1866.\n\n====East London Railway====\nIn 1865 the SER joined a consortium of six railways to form the [[East London Line|East London Railway]], which used the existing [[Thames Tunnel]] to connect [[Wapping]] on the north bank of the Thames with [[Rotherhithe]] on the south.  The other partners were: the [[Great Eastern Railway]] (GER), the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&SCR), the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LCDR), the [[Metropolitan Railway]], and the [[District Railway]]. Over the next four years it was converted to railway use and connected with existing lines.<ref>{{cite news |title=Railway And Other Companies, East London |newspaper=The Times |date=2 September 1869}}</ref>\n\nThe line was principally used for freight across London but the SER introduced a service between {{Stnlnk|Addiscombe}} and Liverpool Street from April 1880 until March 1884. From March to September 1884 the service ran from Addiscombe to [[St Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station|St Mary's]] Whitechapel Road.\n\n==Chairmanship of Edward Watkin==\n\nThis period of factionalism was eventually ended with the appointment of a new and able Chairman in March 1866.<ref>Greaves (2008), pp.104-5.</ref> This was [[Edward Watkin|Edward (later Sir Edward) Watkin]] who was also chairman of the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] and the [[Metropolitan Railway]], as well as being a director of [[Chemin de Fer du Nord]] in France. However his appointment was quickly followed by the collapse of bankers [[Overend, Gurney and Company]] on 10 May 1866 and the subsequent financial crisis during the following year. This had a severe effect on expansion plans of several railways. No new lines were built by the SER until the opening of the [[Sandling]] to [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] branch line on 9 October 1874. The LCDR went bankrupt and was taken into administration 12 July 1866,<ref>White (1961), 48</ref> and in 1867 the LB&SCR was also on the brink of bankruptcy.<ref>Turner (1978) p.262</ref> The directors and shareholders saw that constant quarrelling between the three companies had damaged their interests and began talks to merge or to work together.<ref>London Brighton & South Coast Railway (1867)</ref> In 1868 a [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] was presented to Parliament to allow for co-operative working of railways of southern England (the SER, the LCDR, the LB&SCR and the L&SWR). However this failed at a late stage when Parliament sought to limit the fares charged by the SER to those of the LB&SCR, and the SER withdrew.<ref>White (1961), 49</ref> A further attempt to merge the SER and LCDR in 1875 failed when the latter withdrew after shareholders felt it favoured the SER.\n\nWatkin had long-term ambitions for the SER to become one link in a chain of 'Watkin' railways from the industrial north of England to the Continent via a proposed [[Channel Tunnel]]. His plans for a Channel Tunnel were ultimately blocked by the [[War Office]], and suspicion fell on [[James Staats Forbes]], chairman of the LCDR for having urged the decision.<ref name=\"Riemdijk 1980 p.72\">Heap and van Riemdijk (1980), p.72.</ref>\n\n===Oxted & Westerham Lines===\nOne result of improved relations between the SER and the LB&SCR during the 1870s was that the two collaborated in construction of a [[Oxted Line|line]] between [[South Croydon railway station|South Croydon]] on the main Brighton line and [[Oxted railway station|Oxted]]. The completion of the ''Orpington cut-off'' in 1866 reduced services to and from the growing town of [[Croydon]]. The LB&SCR had supported a plan to build the [[Surrey and Sussex Junction Railway]] along this route in 1865, but its involvement had been opposed by the SER as being contrary to their agreement, and the scheme was abandoned during the 1867 financial crisis. However, following a revised agreement, the scheme was revived as a joint venture. Beyond Oxted the LB&SCR linked with its lines to [[East Grinstead railway station|East Grinstead]] and [[Tunbridge Wells railway station|Tunbridge Wells]], while the SER joined its original main line to [[Tonbridge railway station|Tonbridge]] Tunbridge Wells and [[Hastings railway station|Hastings]]. Authority for construction of these lines was granted in 1878 and they opened in 1884.\n\nAs a part of the same scheme, the SER at last began to implement plans for the [[Westerham Valley Branch Line|a line]] from [[Dunton Green]] on its new main line to Oxted via [[Westerham railway station|Westerham]], the first phase of which opened on 7 July 1881.  Authorisation for line was first obtained in 1864, but no progress had been made by 1876, when local inhabitants sponsored a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] their own bill, forcing the hand of the SER.<ref>Searle, MV (1983) Lost Lines: Anthology of Britain's Lost Railways, New Cavendish Books P42</ref> In the event only the first phase (from Dunton Green to Westerham) was built, leaving a [[Branch line]] rather than a through route. The remaining four miles (6&nbsp;km) to the new [[Oxted Line]] (then still under construction) were never completed due to opposition in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the difficult terrain between Westerham and Oxted.<ref>Searle, MV (1983) Lost Lines: Anthology of Britain's Lost Railways, New Cavendish Books P43</ref>\n\n===Unpopularity of the SER===\n\nDuring the 1880s and 1890s the SER was accused of only caring about Continental travellers and of neglecting the interests of its other customers. A series of letters to [[The Times]] in London in 1883 demonstrated how unpopular the railway had become with its regular commuters.<ref>'Letters to the Editor' ''The Times'', 20 Sep 25 Sep, and 8 October 1883.</ref> Ernest Foxwell, also writing in 1883, stated 'The great blots on the South Eastern are its unpunctuality, its fares, its third class carriages, and the way in which ''local'' interests are sacrificed to Continental traffic.'<ref>Foxwell (1883), p.530.</ref> Hamilton Ellis later described both the SER and the LCDR at this time as 'bywords of poverty stricken inefficiency and dirtiness'.<ref>C. Hamilton Ellis, British Railway History, Vol.1. 1830-1876, George Allen and Unwin, 1954, p.41.</ref> In spite of these criticisms the shareholders stuck with their chairman, until they eventually realised that their own interests were suffering as well. A scathing article in ''The Investors Review'' for June 1894 demonstrated how poorly Watkin's railways had performed financially compared to others, and referred to the SER's 'bitter hatred towards all but first-class travellers, [and] their determined cultivation of the art of running empty coaches'. The article finished,\n:the Company is now almost too weak to turn round and adopt a wise policy. It might become bankrupt in the process ; so the best thing to do is to leave it severely alone. Just as none travel by it who can find another route, so none should touch its common stocks who are free to do otherwise.<ref>\"'Progress' on the South-Eastern Railway'\" (1894), ''The Investors Review'', XIV. June 1894, pp. 343-9.</ref>\n\nWatkin retired shortly afterwards.\n\nSome of the complaints of unpunctuality of the SER may have been exaggerated, or were at least soon remedied after Watkin's departure, since a statistical survey of the company's services conducted in 1895 by William Acworth found that, with the exception of the heavily congested and difficult to operate lines between London Bridge and Cannon Street and Charing Cross, the company did not perform significantly worse than others in London in terms of timekeeping.<ref>Acworth (1895).</ref>\n\n===Later branches and proposed lines===\nDuring the 1870s and the 1880s the railway attempted to exploit the potential of the East Kent coast as both holiday destinations and potential new channel ports. Thus branches were built from [[Sandling railway station|Sandling]] near Folkestone to [[Sandgate Branch|Hythe and Sandgate]], (opened 9 October 1874); from Dover to [[Deal railway station|Deal]] and [[Sandwich railway station|Sandwich]] ([[Kent Coast Line|jointly with the LCDR]], which opened 15 June 1881); from [[Appledore (Kent) railway station|Appledore]] to [[Dungeness railway station (SER)|Dungeness]] (1 April 1883) and [[New Romney and Littlestone-on-Sea railway station|New Romney]] (19 June 1884). (In 1897 the SER obtained powers to build a branch line from [[Crowhurst railway station]] to its own station at [[Bexhill-on-sea]] in opposition to the existing LB&SCR service to the town.) However this line was not completed until 1902.<ref>White (1961), p. 36.</ref>\n\nOn  4 July 1887 the railway opened the [[Elham Valley Railway|Elham Valley Line]] from [[Canterbury West railway station|Canterbury West]] to [[Folkestone West railway station|Shorncliffe]]. However, there was by then already an LCDR line from Canterbury to Dover and so the new line did not attract much traffic. Likewise on 1 October 1892 the [[Hawkhurst Branch]] from [[Paddock Wood]] to [[Goudhurst|Hope Mill]] was opened and extended to [[Hawkhurst]] on 4 September 1893.\n\nSimilarly the company also obtained Parliamentary Powers to build a line from [[Appledore (Kent)|Appledore]] to [[Maidstone]] via [[Headcorn railway station|Headcorn]] and the [[Loose, Kent|Loose Valley]].<ref>Sekon (1895), p.36.</ref>\n\n====Chatham extension====\nProbably the most wasteful competitive venture by the SER was a second bridge over the river Medway between [[Strood railway station|Strood]] leading to a branch to [[Rochester Common railway station|Rochester]] (opened July 1891) and to [[Chatham Central railway station|Chatham]]. The branch line only had a twenty-year life-span as the stations were less conveniently sited than the LCDR alternatives. The LCDR main line was however re-aligned after 1911 to use the newer bridge.<ref>White (1961), p.64.</ref>\n\n===London suburbs===\nUnlike the neighbouring LB&SCR, the SER failed to capitalise on the rapidly growing population of the South London suburbs during the 1870s and 1880s, and to develop effective suburban services. In particular, the area between the [[North Kent Line]] the [[Dartford Loop Line]] became well populated at this time, but the SER was reluctant to build a proposed [[Bexleyheath Line]], including stations at [[Blackheath railway station|Blackheath]], [[Eltham railway station|Eltham]], [[Bexleyheath railway station|Bexleyheath]] and [[Slade Green railway station|Slade Green]], in spite of public pressure in the 1880s. This line was eventually built as a private concern in 1895, and it was only after the original investors had gone bankrupt and Watkin had retired that the SER eventually agreed to incorporate it into its system.\n\nAs mentioned above, the line from London Bridge to Charing Cross and Cannon Street was particularly congested and difficult to operate. During the early 1890s the SER was actively considering extending the Bricklayers Arms branch into Charing Cross and Cannon Street as a means of relieving this congestion, but deferred making any decision to do so and ultimately the idea was dropped following the operating agreement with the LCDR in 1899, which provided the new 'joint railway' with two further pathways into London.\n\nOne of the last branch lines to be incorporated into the SER was between [[Purley railway station|Purley]] and [[Tattenham Corner railway station]]. The line as far as Chipstead and Kingswood were built by the Chipstead Valley Railway from 1893 and opened in 1897. The extension to Tattenham Corner was built by the Epsom Downs Extension Railway from 1894.  Both companies were acquired by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]].,<ref>{{cite web|title=Epsom Downs Branch - Early History (1865 - 1928)|publisher=Wymann.info|author=Adrian Wymann|year=2007|url=http://www.wymann.info/EpsomDowns/1865-1928.html|accessdate=18 April 2007}}</ref> but the line to Tattenham Corner was not completed until 1901, after the working agreement with the LCDR. This line was in the territory of the LB&SCR but provided the railway with access to a proportion of the lucrative [[Epsom Downs Racecourse]] traffic.\n\n==South Eastern and Chatham Railways Joint Management Committee==\n[[File:SERmap.jpg|thumb|left|A sketch map of the SER at the time of the creation of the SE&CR]]\n{{main|South Eastern and Chatham Railway}}\n\nDuring the early 1890s competition between the SER and the LCDR reached ruinous proportions with both companies offering nearly identical services to and from the same towns, which inevitably lost money for both companies.<ref name=\"Riemdijk 1980 p.72\"/> However, following the resignation of Watkin in 1894, relations between the two companies gradually improved under his successors Sir George Russell (1895) and, most notably, under [[Cosmo Bonsor]] (1897). Bonsor managed to persuade the two boards of governors to see sense and from 1 January 1899 the ''South Eastern and Chatham Railways Joint Management Committee'' was formed to oversee joint working, with Bonsor as its chairman. On 5 August 1899 the South Eastern and London, Chatham and Dover Railway Companies Act was passed, which resulted in the formation of the [[South Eastern and Chatham Railway]] (SE&CR). This was not a true merger since each company kept its individual board of directors within the organisation.\n\nThe quality of service of the SE&CR and the level of public estimation of its two constituent railways increased considerably during the next thirty-five years. The SER was however abolished on 1 January 1923 under the terms of the [[Railways Act 1921]].\n\n==Train services==\nThroughout its independent existence, the SER was primarily a passenger rather than a freight railway, with passenger receipts accounting for more than 72% of its revenues.<ref>Sekon (1895), p.27.</ref>\n\n===Freight services===\nPrior to 1862 the company carried international postal traffic. However, in 1862 they refused to renew the contract as it stipulated the Dover-Calais rather than the SER's preferred Folkestone-Boulogne route. As a result, the contract went to the LCDR.<ref>Nock (1961), pp.56-7.</ref>\n\nIt was not until after the formation of the SECR Management Committee in 1899 that the company began to take the development of its freight traffic seriously, with the ordering of a powerful new freight [[SECR C class]].<ref>Bradley (1980), p.8.</ref> Prior to that most freight on the system had either been products imported through the Channel ports, or else locally developed freight, such as farm produce travelling to London. The principal freight depot on the system was at Bricklayers Arms.\n\nThe [[cement]] industry based around [[Swanscombe#Cement industry|Swanscombe]] and the [[Medway Towns]] provided some minerals traffic, but again it was only after the foundation of [[Blue Circle Industries]] in 1900 that this was developed. Similarly, the [[Kent coalfield]] was not discovered until 1890 and only developed in the early twentieth century.\n\n===Passenger services===\nAs mentioned above, the SER was accused during the 1880s of concentrating on its [[Boat train]]s and Continental passenger traffic at the expense of its local services in Kent and the London suburbs.\n\n====London suburban services====\nOne area where the SER did fail compared with the LB&SCR and the L&SWR was in developing effective services to the rapidly growing suburbs of south east London. This was probably due to an unwillingness to generate even more traffic through the very restricted entry pathway into London between [[Deptford]] and London Bridge. The SER did however have the advantage of taking commuters far closer to the centres of business and commerce at Charing Cross and Cannon Street, whereas the LB&SCR and LS&WR deposited them south of the river Thames at London Bridge and [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo]] respectively.\n\n====Holiday traffic====\nThe SER served an area with a long coastline within easy travelling distance of London. During the 1860s the railway was an important factor in the development of holiday destinations such as [[Margate]] and [[Ramsgate]] in Kent and [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] and [[Hastings]] in East Sussex.\n\n====Continental excursions====\nIn May 1844 the SER organised the first of seven rail and ferry excursions that year from London to Boulogne which together carried more than 2,000 people.<ref>Christian Wolmar, Fire and steam: a new history of the railways in Britain, London, Atlantic Books, 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84354-629-0}} p.80.</ref>\n\n====Hop picking====\nBy the 1870s, the South Eastern Railway was running [[Hopper hut|Hop Pickers' Specials]] to transport large numbers of working-class Londoners to towns and villages in Kent and East Sussex for the season.\n\n==Communications, Signalling and Accidents==\n\n===Electric telegraph===\n[[Electric telegraph]] was installed throughout the SER by 1848.<ref name=\"Topham 1848 p.7\"/> These were sold to the [[General Post Office]] for \u00a3200,000 in 1870<ref>Sekon (1895), p.30.</ref> ({{Inflation|UK|200000|1870|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}\n\n===Signals and signal boxes===\n[[File:Borough Market Junction signal box National Railway Museum (1).jpg|thumb|Borough Market Junction signal box, a South Eastern Railway Type design on display outside the station hall at the National Railway Museum, York.]]\n\n===Accidents===\nThe SER did not have a good safety record with a large number of both major and minor accidents throughout its independent existence.\n\nOne of the most notable accidents occurred on 9 June 1865, when the [[boat train]] from [[Folkestone]] ran onto a partly dismantled bridge near [[Staplehurst]]. The locomotive and tender ran across the timber baulks to reach the far side, but the carriages were derailed and fell into the [[River Beult]]. The [[Staplehurst rail crash]] killed ten passengers and [[Charles Dickens]] narrowly avoided severe injury, or even death. He was travelling with [[Nelly Ternan]] and her mother at the front of the train in a first-class carriage, which escaped complete derailment when the locomotive and tender left the track as a result of repairs to the line. Timber baulks under the track were being replaced but the foreman mis-read the timetable, and two lengths of rail were missing on the viaduct. As the lead vehicles left the line, the impact on the remaining beams caused the cast iron girders below to fracture, and most of the following vehicles left the viaduct and ended up in the River Beult some {{convert|15|ft|m|1}} below. The foreman was indicted and convicted of [[manslaughter]], and served 6 months hard labour for his crime.<ref name=\"Sekon 1895, p.19\">Sekon (1895), p.19.</ref>\n\nOther significant accidents involving multiple fatalities were as follows:\n* 11 December 1844 the boiler explosion of locomotive No. 78 ''Forrester'' caused a bridge collapse near Bricklayers Arms, [[Surrey]] and killed two staff.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/eventsummary.php?eventID=1651 |title = Accident at Bricklayers Arms on 11th December 1844 :: The Railways Archive}}</ref><ref>Hewison (1983) pp.27-28.</ref>\n* 21 August 1854 a collision at [[East Croydon railway station]] killed three passengers. This accident also involved the LB&SCR signalman and was later judged to be partly the result of signalling error and poor communication, as well as the SER driver.\n* 12 September 1855 - a collision between two trains near [[Reading Southern railway station|Reading station]] killed five.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=1810 |title = Accident Returns: Extract for the Accident at Reading on 12th September 1855 :: The Railways Archive}}</ref>\n* 28 June 1857 - the [[Lewisham rail crash (1857)|Lewisham rail crash]] killed 11 people.

The company was formed to construct a route from [[London]] to [[Dover]]. Branch lines were later opened to [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Hastings]], [[Canterbury]] and other places in Kent. The SER absorbed or leased other railways, some older than itself, including the [[London and Greenwich Railway]] and the [[Canterbury and Whitstable Railway]]. Most of the company's routes were in [[Kent]], eastern [[Sussex]] and the London suburbs, with a long cross-country route from {{stnlnk|Redhill}} in Surrey to [[Reading, Berkshire]].\n\nMuch of the company's early history saw attempts at expansion and feuding with its neighbours; the [[London Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LBSCR) in the west and the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LCDR) to the north-east. However, in 1899 the SER agreed with the LCDR to share operation of the two railways, work them as a single system (marketed as the [[South Eastern and Chatham Railway]]) and pool receipts: but it was not a full amalgamation. The SER and LCDR remained separate companies until becoming constituents of the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] on 1 January 1923.\n\n==Origins of the company==\nThere had been proposals for a railway between London and Dover in 1825, 1832 and 1835, but they came to nothing due to opposition from landowners or the difficulties of bridging the [[River Medway]] near its mouth.<ref>Sekon (1895), pp.2-3.</ref> On 21 June 1836, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed a [[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Private Act]] (6 Wm.IV., cap.75) incorporating the ''South Eastern and Dover Railway,'' which shortly afterwards changed to the South Eastern Railway.<ref>Bradshaw (1867), p.305.</ref>\n\n===Choice of route from London to Dover===\n\n{{main|South Eastern Main Line}}\n\nAt the time of inauguration there were two potential rail pathways south from London, and the  [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] had said no further pathways would be permitted.<ref>Sekon (1895), p.3.</ref> The SER therefore considered routes to Dover from the proposed [[London and Southampton Railway]] line at [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], or from the existing [[London and Greenwich Railway]] (L&GR) at Greenwich. The former left London in the wrong direction and then on a roundabout route. The latter provided a useful way for a northern route via [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], and [[Canterbury]], except that lengthening the line beyond Greenwich was blocked by opposition from the [[Admiralty]], and this route would involve tunnelling through the [[North Downs]].\n\nThe engineer of the new line, [[William Cubitt]], was also engineer of the [[London and Croydon Railway]] (L&CR), which planned to use L&GR lines as far as Corbett\u2019s Lane in [[Bermondsey]] before turning south towards [[Croydon]]. A new connection on this line near to [[Norwood Junction railway station|Norwood]] could provide access to a southerly route to Dover via [[Tonbridge]], [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] and [[Folkestone]]. This was less direct than the northerly route but passed through easier country. It involved one significant {{convert|1387|yd|m|adj=on}} tunnel through the [[Shakespeare Cliff Halt railway station|Shakespeare Cliff]] near Dover. This was the route first chosen by the SER at its inauguration.\n\nDuring Parliamentary discussions on the proposed route of the [[London and Brighton Railway]] (L&BR) during 1837, pressure was put on the SER to divert its proposed route so it could also share the L&BR mainline between [[Norwood Junction railway station|Jolly Sailor (Norwood)]] and [[Earlswood Common]], and then travel eastwards to [[Tonbridge]]. Under the scheme proposed by Parliament, the railway from Croydon to [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] would be built by the L&BR but the SER would have the right to refund half the construction costs and own that part of the line between [[Merstham]] and Redhill. The SER gave way to this proposal as it reduced the construction costs, although it resulted in a route {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} longer than by road, running south for {{convert|14.5|mi|km|0}} and then turning east. It also meant that its trains from [[London Bridge railway station|London Bridge]] passed over the lines of three other companies: the L&GR to Corbett's Lane Junction, the L&CR as far as 'Jolly Sailor', and the L&BR to Merstham.<ref>White (1961), pp.26-7.</ref>\n\n==Construction of the Main Line==\n\nConstruction began in 1838 at several places simultaneously, and the Shakespeare Tunnel was complete by May 1841 . The L&BR line to Redhill opened on 12 July 1841 and the SER line from [[Redhill to Tonbridge Line|Redhill to Tonbridge]] on 26 May 1842,<ref name=\"Bradley 1963, p.2\">Bradley (1963), p.2.</ref> when SER train services began.<ref>White (1961), pp.28.</ref> The main line reached [[Ashford (Kent) railway station|Ashford]] on 1 December 1842; the outskirts of [[Folkestone]] by 28 June 1843; and [[Dover]] by 7 February 1844.<ref>White (1961), p.30.</ref>  On the same day the SER offered to lease the L&BR for 21 years at \u00a3100,000 per year, but the offer was turned down.<ref>Turner (1977), p.185.</ref> Later that year, the SER refunded to the L&BR \u00a3430,000 and took ownership of the southern half of the [[Brighton Main Line|Croydon-Redhill line]].<ref>Turner (1977), p.171.</ref> Trains ran toll-free to both companies on this stretch but still had pay on the L&CR from [[Norwood Junction railway station]] to Corbett's Lane Junction, and the L&GR into London Bridge.\n\n===Folkestone and Dover Harbours===\nIn 1843, when the railway reached the edge of Folkestone, the company bought the silted and nearly derelict harbour, built by [[Thomas Telford]] in 1809, for \u00a318,000.<ref name=\"White 1961, p.55\">White (1961), p.55</ref> The SER dredged the harbour and, after a trial with the paddle steamer ''[[Water Witch (1835 steamer)|Water Witch]]'', which also demonstrated that a [[day trip|day excursion]] from London to [[Boulogne]] was feasible, arranged for a [[Packet (sea transport)|packet]] company to provide a ferry to Boulogne.<ref>{{cite news |title=A trip to Boulogne and back in one day|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fKYcoP0vZ0sC&pg=PA253#v=onepage |accessdate=16 September 2018 |work=The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal - Scientific and Railway Gazette |issue=Vol VI, July 1843 |location=London |page=253}}</ref> The following year it established the independent ''South Eastern & Continental Steam Packet Company'', which it absorbed in 1853.<ref name=\"White 1961, p.55\"/> James Broadbridge Monger was the Master of the \"Water Witch\" from 1839 to 1844. From 1844 on, he was Master of three vessels which steamed from Dover and Folkestone to Boulogne, Calais and Ostend with passengers and cargo: \"Lord Warden\", \"Princess Helena\" and \"Princess Maude\". In December 1848 it opened a steeply graded branch from the [[Folkestone East railway station|Folkestone station]] to the [[Folkestone Harbour railway station|harbour]].<ref>Bradley, (1963), p.2</ref>\n\nThe SER opened [[List of railway stations in Dover#Dover Town|Dover (later Dover Town)]] station on 7 February 1844. This was originally a terminus, but in 1860 the line was continued to Admiralty Pier. Thereafter the SER concentrated most of its resources into developing Folkestone Harbour, which became its principal base for cross-channel ferries.<ref>Body (1989), pp.96-7</ref> The company had complete control of Folkestone whereas at Dover it had to negotiate with both the [[Admiralty]] and the local town council, and the rail route from Boulogne to Paris was better developed than that from Calais.\n\nIn 1848 the SER served two steam ships a day between Folkestone and Boulogne, one a day between Dover and Calais, and one between Dover and Ostend.<ref name=\"Topham 1848 p.7\">Topham's railway time-table and guide (1848), p.7.</ref>\n\n===Bricklayers Arms Terminus===\nDuring 1843, before the main line was complete, the SER and the L&CR became anxious about the charges imposed by the L&GR for the use of the terminus at London Bridge and its approaches. Parliament had relaxed restrictions on new railways into London and so SER sought authority to construct a branch from Corbett's Lane to a new temporary passenger terminus and goods station at [[Bricklayers Arms railway station]], for use by both railways, removing the need to use the Greenwich Railway.<ref>Turner (1977) pp. 192-204.</ref> This opened 1 May 1844.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963, p.2\"/> According to [[Charles Vignoles]], 'the making of Bricklayers Arms station was a matter of compulsion in driving the Greenwich people to reasonable terms'.<ref>Dendy Marshall (1963) p. 32.</ref> Plans to extend from Bricklayers Arms to a new SER terminus at [[Hungerford Bridge]], nearer the centre of London, were rejected by Parliament.<ref>Board of Trade (1845).</ref> Similarly, a revised proposal to extend the line to [[Waterloo Road, London|Waterloo Road]] in 1846 was rejected by a committee of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].<ref>South Eastern Railway (1847).</ref>\n\nThe L&GR was nearly bankrupt in 1844 and the SER leased its line from 1 January 1845. It became the [[Greenwich Line|Greenwich branch]] of that railway.<ref>Turner (1977), pp.201\u20133</ref> Thereafter further developments were at London Bridge, and following a shunting accident during August 1850 which caused the collapse of a large part of the station roof,<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (25 August 1850)</ref> the SER closed Bricklayers Arms terminus to passenger traffic in 1852 converting it into a goods facility.\n\n==Secondary Main lines and Branch lines==\nOver the next two decades the SER system spread throughout Kent and Surrey, building lines to connect towns to its main line or acquiring those already in existence.\n\n=== Canterbury & Whitstable Railway ===\nIn 1844 the SER took over the bankrupt [[Canterbury and Whitstable Railway]], which had opened in 1830. This continued to be worked as an isolated line until the SER reached Canterbury from Ashford in 1846, with its line to [[Ashford to Ramsgate (via Canterbury West) line|Ramsgate]].<ref>White (1961), pp.16-8.</ref>\n\n===Medway Valley Line===\nThe first branch built by the SER was the [[Medway Valley Line]] on 24 September 1844,  from [[Paddock Wood]] to [[Maidstone]]. This was continued to [[Strood railway station]] on 18 June 1856.<ref>Bradley (1963) p.2.</ref>\n\n===Greenwich Line===\nLeasing the London and Greenwich Railway from 1 January 1845 gave the company control of its main line into London and provided a branch [[Greenwich Line|line]] to [[Greenwich railway station|Greenwich]]. Further eastward extension was not possible due to opposition from the [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]], but it was eventually opened in 1878 when the line joined the [[North Kent Line]] at [[Charlton railway station|Charlton]].\n\n===Tunbridge Wells and Hastings Line===\nA secondary [[Hastings Line|main line]] from [[Tonbridge]] to the outskirts of [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]] opened 20 September 1845. It was extended to [[Tunbridge Wells railway station|Tunbridge Wells Central]] on 25 November 1846.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963 p.2\">Bradley (1963) p.2</ref> By 1 September 1851 [[Hastings Line|the line]] had reached [[Robertsbridge]] and was extended to [[Battle]], [[West St Leonards|Bopeep Junction]] and {{stnlink|Hastings}} on 1 February 1852. By this time Hastings had already been reached by the SER in a [[Marshlink Line|roundabout route]] from [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford]], which opened 13 February 1851.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963 pp.2-3\">Bradley (1963) pp.2-3.</ref> From this line was a short branch to [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye Harbour]].\n\n===Ramsgate, Margate and Deal Lines===\nDuring 1846 the SER opened another secondary [[Ashford to Ramsgate (via Canterbury West) line|main line]] from [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford]] to [[Ramsgate railway station|Ramsgate]] with a branch from there to [[Margate railway station|Margate]] on 1 December 1846.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963 p.2\"/> A further branch from this [[Kent Coast Line|line]] from [[Minster-in-Thanet|Minster]] to [[Deal railway station|Deal]] was opened 7 July 1847.\n\n===Gravesend and Strood Lines (North Kent)===\nAs the SER was prevented from extending its Greenwich line, it opened a secondary [[North Kent Line|main line]] from [[Lewisham railway station|Lewisham]] to [[Gravesend railway station|Gravesend]] and then to [[Strood railway station|Strood]] on the banks of the [[Medway]] on 30 July 1849.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963 pp.2-3\"/> The second half between Gravesend and Strood had been built as the [[Gravesend and Rochester canal]] and a single track railway had been added to form the Gravesend and Rochester Railway. The SER offered to buy the canal and railway in 1845 and filled in the canal and doubled the track.<ref>Bradley (1963), p.37.</ref> The first section (built by the SER) connected [[Woolwich railway station|Woolwich]] and [[Dartford railway station|Dartford]] to the railway network.\n\nIn 1852 a freight branch was constructed from this line at Charlton to the Thames at [[Angerstein's Wharf]], used for landing coal.<ref>Bradshaw (1867), p. 306.</ref> A line opened on 18 June 1856 up the Medway valley to [[Maidstone West railway station|Maidstone West]].\n\n==Early Management of the Company 1843-1855==\nIn September 1845 the SER appointed [[James Macgregor (MP)|James Macgregor]] (sometimes spelled McGregor or M'Gregor) to a new post combining the roles of Chairman and Managing Director. He exercised absolute power over the company for the next nine years, until he was ultimately forced to resign in 1854 and leave the Board in 1855.<ref>Gray (1990), p.21.</ref> Macgregor's lack of accountability, his opaque and at times dubious working methods led to a number of strategic errors in the building of new lines and in the company's relations with its neighbours, which would have an adverse impact on the company for decades to come.<ref>Greaves (2008), pp.103-4.</ref>\n\n===Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway===\nIn 1846 the SER supported the formation of the Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway, a scheme to build a line connecting the London to Brighton main line at Redhill with the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) main line at [[Reading Southern railway station|Reading]],<ref>Nock (1961), p.20.</ref> and agreed to operate its services. The [[North Downs Line|new line]] was completed 4 July 1849, and in 1852 was absorbed by SER.<ref>White (1961), p.127.</ref> Both the LB&SCR and [[London and South Western Railway]] (L&SWR) regarded this line as a significant incursion into their areas of operation. Likewise the acquisition of a line so remote from its main area of operation, and of doubtful profitability, caused heated discussion and the resignation of several directors, who felt that the company should rather secure its territory and develop services in Kent, as the LB&SCR was doing in Sussex.<ref>Heap & van Riemdijk (1980), p.70.</ref> It would also ultimately bring about Macgregor's downfall.<ref>White (1961), p.39.</ref> Nevertheless, in 1858 the GWR, L&SWR, and SER made a three-year agreement to share traffic and provide a connecting line between their stations at Reading.<ref>Kidner (1953), p.9.</ref> The line now (2015) forms part of the [[North Downs Line]].\n\n===Early relations with the London Brighton and South Coast Railway===\nDuring the first years, relations between the SER, L&CR and L&BR were cordial, with the companies pooling locomotives and forming a joint locomotive committee.<ref>Bradley (1963), p.7.</ref> However, all three considered they were disadvantaged by this arrangement and in 1845 gave notice of withdrawal. The merger of the L&BR and L&CR to form the LB&SCR in July 1846 created a powerful rival to the SER in areas of east Sussex and east Surrey not yet connected to the railway. Relations between the two companies were bad from the outset, especially at those sites where they shared facilities, such as the approaches to London Bridge, [[East Croydon railway station|East Croydon]], and [[Redhill railway station|Redhill]]. Also the SER had long wanted to build a line to [[Brighton]],<ref>Turner (1978), p.31.</ref> and the LB&SCR had inherited plans for a line into mid-Kent from the L&CR,<ref>Turner (1977), p.278.</ref> and from [[Bulverhythe railway station|Bulverhythe (St Leonards)]] to [[Ashford (Kent) railway station|Ashford]] via [[Hastings railway station|Hastings]] from the L&BR. Matters were further complicated in 1846 when the SER was empowered to build a line from its existing branch at [[Tunbridge Wells railway station|Tunbridge Wells]] to Hastings.<ref>Turner (1977), p.222.</ref>\n\nUnsuccessful discussions took place regarding a merger of the two companies, but eventually an agreement on 10 July 1848 (ratified in Parliament in 1849) abolished tolls for using each other's lines and prevented further eastward expansion by the LB&SCR beyond Hastings and westward further expansion by the SER.<ref>Turner (1978) pp.29-34.</ref> Under this agreement the LB&SCR, would share the line from Bulverhythe to Hastings and transfer to the SER its rights to build a line to Ashford but at the same time it retained the right to use the Bricklayers Arms branch and construct its own {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} goods depot on the site for a rent of one shilling (\u00a30.05) per year.<ref>Sekon (1895), p.13.</ref>\n\nThe 1848/9 agreement did not prevent further squabbling between the two companies, notably with the opening of the railway from Ashford to Hastings in 1851. The LB&SCR had originally sought to build it and then had attempted to delay its completion by the SER. In retaliation, the SER attempted to deny LB&SCR access to its station at Hastings. The matter was resolved in court in favour of the LB&SCR, but victory was short-lived as the following year the SER opened its lines from Tunbridge Wells, reducing the distance by rail to Hastings from London.<ref>Turner (1978), p.222.</ref>\n\n===Closing the Capital Account===\nMacgregor's greatest strategic mistake was his failure to address the concerns of the proposers of the [[East Kent Railway]], which ultimately led to the creation of an important rival in northern Kent and also for the Continental rail traffic.\n\nBetween 1844 and 1858, the SER had a monopoly of rail transport in Kent, but served the north of the county poorly. The SER [[North Kent Line|line]] from [[Strood railway station|Strood]] into London had opened in 1849. A plan to continue this line as far as [[Chilham]] where it would join the [[Ashford to Ramsgate (via Canterbury West) Line|Ashford to Canterbury Line]], was rejected by Parliament in 1847 due to financial considerations and never resurrected.<ref>White (1961) p.38.</ref> One group of SER directors were anxious to 'close the capital account' and build no more lines,<ref>Smiles (1905), pp.233-4.</ref> even though this might leave the field open to rival projects, as would later prove to be the case. As a result, there was no planned service to the north Kent towns to the east of the [[River Medway]]. Likewise SER routes to [[Margate]], [[Deal railway station|Deal]], and [[Canterbury]] were circuitous and other towns had no railway at all.  As a result of the railway's unwillingness to act, plans for an independent line from the SER station at [[Strood railway station|Strood]] to [[Faversham railway station|Faversham]] and [[Canterbury]] were made following a public meeting at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in 1850.<ref>Nock (1961), p.45.</ref>\n\n==Factionalism and bad management 1854-1866==\nFollowing Macgregor's resignation in 1854, there followed a decade of factionalism among the directors and equally poor management, described by [[Samuel Smiles]] the Company Secretary as 'not so much business as speech-making, that seemed to be the work of the Board.'<ref>Nock (1961), 48.</ref> It was during this period that there was a continuing failure to deal with underlying problems in the company, and its relationships with its neighbours together with further strategic errors which weakened what might otherwise have been a profitable enterprise.\n\n===East Kent and London Chatham & Dover Railways===\nThe [[East Kent Railway]] (EKR) from Strood to Canterbury, proposed in 1850 achieved parliamentary approval in 1853, and also for an extension to [[Dover]] in 1855, but it failed to secure [[running powers]] over the SER line into London: instead the SER reluctantly agreed to handle London traffic from the line.<ref>Nock (1961), p.46-7.</ref> Many SER directors were convinced the line would never be built, or would go bankrupt, and so took no interest in the scheme or in suggestions that the line should amalgamate with their railway.<ref>Smiles (1905), pp.235-6.</ref> They were proved wrong.\n\nIn 1856 the EKR again unsuccessfully sought running powers over the SER into London, and then obtained powers to build its own route via [[St Mary Cray railway station]] and [[Bromley South railway station]]. The EKR secured running powers over the LB&SCR lines into Pimlico and, after 1860, to [[London Victoria railway station|Victoria Station]].<ref>White (1961), pp.39-40.</ref> The EKR became the [[London Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LCDR) in 1859 and completed its rival route to Dover on 22 July 1861. By July 1863 the LCDR had its own independent route to Victoria, and in 1864 its own terminus on the edge of the [[City of London]] at [[Ludgate Hill railway station|Ludgate Hill]].<ref>Bradley (1979), pp. 4-6.</ref> For 36 years it would be an important competitor of the SER both for Continental and also local traffic in Kent.\n\nA further serious strategic mistake was the refusal of the SER to accept the terms of the contract for the cross-channel carriage of mails in 1862, as this stipulated the use of Dover rather than Folkestone.<ref>White (1961), p.57</ref> This enabled the [[London Chatham and Dover Railway]] which had only reached Dover in 1861 to secure the contract and the following year would give it leverage when it came to negotiating the Continental Traffic Agreement.\n\n===Continued Bad Relations with the LB&SCR===\nA new and protracted dispute with the LB&SCR took place between 1855 and 1862 over the [[Caterham Line|Caterham branch line]], which was built by an independent company in SER territory but connected to the railway network at the former LB&SCR station at [[Purley railway station|Purley]]. The SER refused to allow the line to be leased to the LB&SCR, which in turn refused to re-open its station, delayed opening of the line for a year, and made the Caterham company bankrupt. The SER took over the line in 1859, but the LB&SCR made life difficult for passengers to London.\n\nThe SER objected to the LB&SCR agreement with the [[East Kent Railway]] (later the [[London Chatham and Dover Railway]]) to provide access over its lines to its [[Pimlico]] station and later the jointly owned [[London Victoria railway station|Victoria]] station (see below), and also for handling that company's freight traffic at 'Willow Walk', (a part of the [[Bricklayers Arms railway station|Bricklayers Arms]] goods facility). Further difficulties between occurred at [[East Croydon railway station]] in 1862. With completion of the LB&SCR line to [[London Victoria station|Victoria station]], extra platforms were needed to accommodate the service. The platforms were treated by the LB&SCR as a separate station, named \"New Croydon\", with its own ticket office, and ran exclusively LB&SCR services. This enabled the railway to offer cheaper fares from New Croydon to London than the SER which only had use of East Croydon station.<ref>Turner (1978), pp. 240-1.</ref> The SER responded by gaining Parliamentary approval to build its own [[Addiscombe Line|line]] from [[New Beckenham railway station|New Beckenham]] to a new station at Croydon ([[Addiscombe railway station|Addiscombe Road]]), which opened 1 April 1864.\n\nRelations with the LB&SCR reached a low point in 1863, when the general manager and secretary had to report the history of relations between the companies since the agreement of 1848-9.<ref>Eborall and Smiles (1863).</ref> This set out the history although from the SER perspective.\n\nA branch from Lewisham to [[Beckenham]] opened in 1857, becoming the temporary terminus of the [[East Kent Railway]]. Following the dispute with the LB&SCR over New Croydon (see below) an extension of this [[Addiscombe Line|line]] to [[Addiscombe railway station|Addiscombe (Croydon)]] was opened in 1864.<ref>Bradley (1963) p. 3.</ref>\n\n===Continental Traffic Agreement (1863)===\nThe SER and the LCDR agreed to pool Continental traffic receipts between [[Hastings railway station|Hastings]] and [[Margate railway station|Margate]], together with local receipts to Dover and Folkestone. It then re-allocated them to a formula which gave the SER two-thirds of the receipts in 1863, gradually reducing to one half in 1872.<ref>Nock (1961), pp.57-8.</ref> The agreement appeared to unduly favour the LCDR, particularly after 1870. It did not prevent competition as the railways could claim additional funds from the pool if they carried more than their proportion of customers. Both companies sought to get round the agreement - the LCDR by establishing a Continental service from [[Queenborough]] on the [[Isle of Sheppey]], which was outside the scope of the agreement. Similarly, the SER built a local station at [[Folkestone West railway station|Shorncliffe]] on the edge of Folkestone, which it claimed was not part of Folkestone, and from which it charged lower fares.<ref>White (1961), p.47-9</ref>\n\nFollowing establishment of a LCDR service from Queenborough to [[Flushing, Netherlands]] in 1876, the SER was allowed to build the [[Hundred of Hoo Railway]] from its line near Gravesend to a new port on the across the Medway from Queenborough, called [[Port Victoria railway station|Port Victoria]]. The line opened in September 1882.\n\n===Improvements to the main line===\nIn 1860 the LCDR had a more direct route to Dover than the SER, and  both the company's rivals had access to a London terminus in the prosperous [[West End of London]] while the SER only had its terminal on the south side of the river [[Thames]] at [[London Bridge railway station|London Bridge]].\n\n====Charing Cross and Cannon Street Stations====\n[[File:Charing Cross station, before it was built over - geograph.org.uk - 1717686.jpg|thumb|[[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] before it was built over with offices with the later [[Southern Railway (UK)|SR]] initials retained.]]\nThe SER converted part of London Bridge to through platforms and extended to [[Blackfriars railway station|near Waterloo]], over [[Hungerford Bridge]] to a station at [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] which opened on 11 January 1864.<ref>Sekon (1893), p.26.</ref> When the LCDR built a line to [[Ludgate Hill railway station]] in the [[City of London]] in 1865, the SER built a new  [[Cannon Street Railway Bridge|bridge]] over the [[Thames]] and a city terminus at [[Cannon Street railway station]], which opened 1 September 1866.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963, p.3\">Bradley (1963), p.3.</ref> These extensions were difficult to operate and were congested at peak times.\n\nOn 16 August 1866 the SER agreed with the [[London and North Western Railway]] to build a joint line between [[Euston railway station]] and Charing Cross, with interchange of traffic,<ref>Bradshaw (1867), Appendix p.17.</ref> but the scheme was abandoned as a result of the 1867 financial crisis.\n\n====Orpington cut-off & Dartford Loop====\nThe SER therefore constructed the direct line via [[Sevenoaks]] to [[Tonbridge]]. It involved crossing the [[North Downs]] by summits and long tunnels at [[Knockholt]] and Sevenoaks. The latter was the longest tunnel in southern England at {{convert|3451|yd|m|0}}. This cut-off line, {{convert|24|mi|km|0}} long, reached [[Chislehurst]] on 1 July 1865, but took three more years to reach [[Orpington]] and Sevenoaks (2 March 1868). The new main line opened on 1 May 1868 when the line reached Tonbridge.<ref name=\"Bradley 1963, p.3\"/>\n\nConstruction of the main line provided the opportunity to build an improved [[Dartford Loop Line|route]] to [[Dartford railway station|Dartford]] from [[Hither Green railway station|Hither Green]] via [[Sidcup]]. This opened 1 September 1866.\n\n====East London Railway====\nIn 1865 the SER joined a consortium of six railways to form the [[East London Line|East London Railway]], which used the existing [[Thames Tunnel]] to connect [[Wapping]] on the north bank of the Thames with [[Rotherhithe]] on the south.  The other partners were: the [[Great Eastern Railway]] (GER), the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&SCR), the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LCDR), the [[Metropolitan Railway]], and the [[District Railway]]. Over the next four years it was converted to railway use and connected with existing lines.<ref>{{cite news |title=Railway And Other Companies, East London |newspaper=The Times |date=2 September 1869}}</ref>\n\nThe line was principally used for freight across London but the SER introduced a service between {{Stnlnk|Addiscombe}} and Liverpool Street from April 1880 until March 1884. From March to September 1884 the service ran from Addiscombe to [[St Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station|St Mary's]] Whitechapel Road.\n\n==Chairmanship of Edward Watkin==\n\nThis period of factionalism was eventually ended with the appointment of a new and able Chairman in March 1866.<ref>Greaves (2008), pp.104-5.</ref> This was [[Edward Watkin|Edward (later Sir Edward) Watkin]] who was also chairman of the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] and the [[Metropolitan Railway]], as well as being a director of [[Chemin de Fer du Nord]] in France. However his appointment was quickly followed by the collapse of bankers [[Overend, Gurney and Company]] on 10 May 1866 and the subsequent financial crisis during the following year. This had a severe effect on expansion plans of several railways. No new lines were built by the SER until the opening of the [[Sandling]] to [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] branch line on 9 October 1874. The LCDR went bankrupt and was taken into administration 12 July 1866,<ref>White (1961), 48</ref> and in 1867 the LB&SCR was also on the brink of bankruptcy.<ref>Turner (1978) p.262</ref> The directors and shareholders saw that constant quarrelling between the three companies had damaged their interests and began talks to merge or to work together.<ref>London Brighton & South Coast Railway (1867)</ref> In 1868 a [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] was presented to Parliament to allow for co-operative working of railways of southern England (the SER, the LCDR, the LB&SCR and the L&SWR). However this failed at a late stage when Parliament sought to limit the fares charged by the SER to those of the LB&SCR, and the SER withdrew.<ref>White (1961), 49</ref> A further attempt to merge the SER and LCDR in 1875 failed when the latter withdrew after shareholders felt it favoured the SER.\n\nWatkin had long-term ambitions for the SER to become one link in a chain of 'Watkin' railways from the industrial north of England to the Continent via a proposed [[Channel Tunnel]]. His plans for a Channel Tunnel were ultimately blocked by the [[War Office]], and suspicion fell on [[James Staats Forbes]], chairman of the LCDR for having urged the decision.<ref name=\"Riemdijk 1980 p.72\">Heap and van Riemdijk (1980), p.72.</ref>\n\n===Oxted & Westerham Lines===\nOne result of improved relations between the SER and the LB&SCR during the 1870s was that the two collaborated in construction of a [[Oxted Line|line]] between [[South Croydon railway station|South Croydon]] on the main Brighton line and [[Oxted railway station|Oxted]]. The completion of the ''Orpington cut-off'' in 1866 reduced services to and from the growing town of [[Croydon]]. The LB&SCR had supported a plan to build the [[Surrey and Sussex Junction Railway]] along this route in 1865, but its involvement had been opposed by the SER as being contrary to their agreement, and the scheme was abandoned during the 1867 financial crisis. However, following a revised agreement, the scheme was revived as a joint venture. Beyond Oxted the LB&SCR linked with its lines to [[East Grinstead railway station|East Grinstead]] and [[Tunbridge Wells railway station|Tunbridge Wells]], while the SER joined its original main line to [[Tonbridge railway station|Tonbridge]] Tunbridge Wells and [[Hastings railway station|Hastings]]. Authority for construction of these lines was granted in 1878 and they opened in 1884.\n\nAs a part of the same scheme, the SER at last began to implement plans for the [[Westerham Valley Branch Line|a line]] from [[Dunton Green]] on its new main line to Oxted via [[Westerham railway station|Westerham]], the first phase of which opened on 7 July 1881.  Authorisation for line was first obtained in 1864, but no progress had been made by 1876, when local inhabitants sponsored a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] their own bill, forcing the hand of the SER.<ref>Searle, MV (1983) Lost Lines: Anthology of Britain's Lost Railways, New Cavendish Books P42</ref> In the event only the first phase (from Dunton Green to Westerham) was built, leaving a [[Branch line]] rather than a through route. The remaining four miles (6&nbsp;km) to the new [[Oxted Line]] (then still under construction) were never completed due to opposition in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the difficult terrain between Westerham and Oxted.<ref>Searle, MV (1983) Lost Lines: Anthology of Britain's Lost Railways, New Cavendish Books P43</ref>\n\n===Unpopularity of the SER===\n\nDuring the 1880s and 1890s the SER was accused of only caring about Continental travellers and of neglecting the interests of its other customers. A series of letters to [[The Times]] in London in 1883 demonstrated how unpopular the railway had become with its regular commuters.<ref>'Letters to the Editor' ''The Times'', 20 Sep 25 Sep, and 8 October 1883.</ref> Ernest Foxwell, also writing in 1883, stated 'The great blots on the South Eastern are its unpunctuality, its fares, its third class carriages, and the way in which ''local'' interests are sacrificed to Continental traffic.'<ref>Foxwell (1883), p.530.</ref> Hamilton Ellis later described both the SER and the LCDR at this time as 'bywords of poverty stricken inefficiency and dirtiness'.<ref>C. Hamilton Ellis, British Railway History, Vol.1. 1830-1876, George Allen and Unwin, 1954, p.41.</ref> In spite of these criticisms the shareholders stuck with their chairman, until they eventually realised that their own interests were suffering as well. A scathing article in ''The Investors Review'' for June 1894 demonstrated how poorly Watkin's railways had performed financially compared to others, and referred to the SER's 'bitter hatred towards all but first-class travellers, [and] their determined cultivation of the art of running empty coaches'. The article finished,\n:the Company is now almost too weak to turn round and adopt a wise policy. It might become bankrupt in the process ; so the best thing to do is to leave it severely alone. Just as none travel by it who can find another route, so none should touch its common stocks who are free to do otherwise.<ref>\"'Progress' on the South-Eastern Railway'\" (1894), ''The Investors Review'', XIV. June 1894, pp. 343-9.</ref> \n\nWatkin retired shortly afterwards. \n\nSome of the complaints of unpunctuality of the SER may have been exaggerated, or were at least soon remedied after Watkin's departure, since a statistical survey of the company's services conducted in 1895 by William Acworth found that, with the exception of the heavily congested and difficult to operate lines between London Bridge and Cannon Street and Charing Cross, the company did not perform significantly worse than others in London in terms of timekeeping.<ref>Acworth (1895).</ref>\n\n===Later branches and proposed lines===\nDuring the 1870s and the 1880s the railway attempted to exploit the potential of the East Kent coast as both holiday destinations and potential new channel ports. Thus branches were built from [[Sandling railway station|Sandling]] near Folkestone to [[Sandgate Branch|Hythe and Sandgate]], (opened 9 October 1874); from Dover to [[Deal railway station|Deal]] and [[Sandwich railway station|Sandwich]] ([[Kent Coast Line|jointly with the LCDR]], which opened 15 June 1881); from [[Appledore (Kent) railway station|Appledore]] to [[Dungeness railway station (SER)|Dungeness]] (1 April 1883) and [[New Romney and Littlestone-on-Sea railway station|New Romney]] (19 June 1884). (In 1897 the SER obtained powers to build a branch line from [[Crowhurst railway station]] to its own station at [[Bexhill-on-sea]] in opposition to the existing LB&SCR service to the town.) However this line was not completed until 1902.<ref>White (1961), p. 36.</ref>\n\nOn  4 July 1887 the railway opened the [[Elham Valley Railway|Elham Valley Line]] from [[Canterbury West railway station|Canterbury West]] to [[Folkestone West railway station|Shorncliffe]]. However, there was by then already an LCDR line from Canterbury to Dover and so the new line did not attract much traffic. Likewise on 1 October 1892 the [[Hawkhurst Branch]] from [[Paddock Wood]] to [[Goudhurst|Hope Mill]] was opened and extended to [[Hawkhurst]] on 4 September 1893.\n\nSimilarly the company also obtained Parliamentary Powers to build a line from [[Appledore (Kent)|Appledore]] to [[Maidstone]] via [[Headcorn railway station|Headcorn]] and the [[Loose, Kent|Loose Valley]].<ref>Sekon (1895), p.36.</ref>\n\n====Chatham extension====\nProbably the most wasteful competitive venture by the SER was a second bridge over the river Medway between [[Strood railway station|Strood]] leading to a branch to [[Rochester Common railway station|Rochester]] (opened July 1891) and to [[Chatham Central railway station|Chatham]]. The branch line only had a twenty-year life-span as the stations were less conveniently sited than the LCDR alternatives. The LCDR main line was however re-aligned after 1911 to use the newer bridge.<ref>White (1961), p.64.</ref>\n\n===London suburbs===\nUnlike the neighbouring LB&SCR, the SER failed to capitalise on the rapidly growing population of the South London suburbs during the 1870s and 1880s, and to develop effective suburban services. In particular, the area between the [[North Kent Line]] the [[Dartford Loop Line]] became well populated at this time, but the SER was reluctant to build a proposed [[Bexleyheath Line]], including stations at [[Blackheath railway station|Blackheath]], [[Eltham railway station|Eltham]], [[Bexleyheath railway station|Bexleyheath]] and [[Slade Green railway station|Slade Green]], in spite of public pressure in the 1880s. This line was eventually built as a private concern in 1895, and it was only after the original investors had gone bankrupt and Watkin had retired that the SER eventually agreed to incorporate it into its system.\n\nAs mentioned above, the line from London Bridge to Charing Cross and Cannon Street was particularly congested and difficult to operate. During the early 1890s the SER was actively considering extending the Bricklayers Arms branch into Charing Cross and Cannon Street as a means of relieving this congestion, but deferred making any decision to do so and ultimately the idea was dropped following the operating agreement with the LCDR in 1899, which provided the new 'joint railway' with two further pathways into London.\n\nOne of the last branch lines to be incorporated into the SER was between [[Purley railway station|Purley]] and [[Tattenham Corner railway station]]. The line as far as Chipstead and Kingswood were built by the Chipstead Valley Railway from 1893 and opened in 1897. The extension to Tattenham Corner was built by the Epsom Downs Extension Railway from 1894.  Both companies were acquired by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]].,<ref>{{cite web|title=Epsom Downs Branch - Early History (1865 - 1928)|publisher=Wymann.info|author=Adrian Wymann|year=2007|url=http://www.wymann.info/EpsomDowns/1865-1928.html|accessdate=18 April 2007}}</ref> but the line to Tattenham Corner was not completed until 1901, after the working agreement with the LCDR. This line was in the territory of the LB&SCR but provided the railway with access to a proportion of the lucrative [[Epsom Downs Racecourse]] traffic.\n\n==South Eastern and Chatham Railways Joint Management Committee==\n[[File:SERmap.jpg|thumb|left|A sketch map of the SER at the time of the creation of the SE&CR]]\n{{main|South Eastern and Chatham Railway}}\n\nDuring the early 1890s competition between the SER and the LCDR reached ruinous proportions with both companies offering nearly identical services to and from the same towns, which inevitably lost money for both companies.<ref name=\"Riemdijk 1980 p.72\"/> However, following the resignation of Watkin in 1894, relations between the two companies gradually improved under his successors Sir George Russell (1895) and, most notably, under [[Cosmo Bonsor]] (1897). Bonsor managed to persuade the two boards of governors to see sense and from 1 January 1899 the ''South Eastern and Chatham Railways Joint Management Committee'' was formed to oversee joint working, with Bonsor as its chairman. On 5 August 1899 the South Eastern and London, Chatham and Dover Railway Companies Act was passed, which resulted in the formation of the [[South Eastern and Chatham Railway]] (SE&CR). This was not a true merger since each company kept its individual board of directors within the organisation.\n\nThe quality of service of the SE&CR and the level of public estimation of its two constituent railways increased considerably during the next thirty-five years. The SER was however abolished on 1 January 1923 under the terms of the [[Railways Act 1921]].\n\n==Train services==\nThroughout its independent existence, the SER was primarily a passenger rather than a freight railway, with passenger receipts accounting for more than 72% of its revenues.<ref>Sekon (1895), p.27.</ref>\n\n===Freight services===\nPrior to 1862 the company carried international postal traffic. However, in 1862 they refused to renew the contract as it stipulated the Dover-Calais rather than the SER's preferred Folkestone-Boulogne route. As a result, the contract went to the LCDR.<ref>Nock (1961), pp.56-7.</ref>\n\nIt was not until after the formation of the SECR Management Committee in 1899 that the company began to take the development of its freight traffic seriously, with the ordering of a powerful new freight [[SECR C class]].<ref>Bradley (1980), p.8.</ref> Prior to that most freight on the system had either been products imported through the Channel ports, or else locally developed freight, such as farm produce travelling to London. The principal freight depot on the system was at Bricklayers Arms.\n\nThe [[cement]] industry based around [[Swanscombe#Cement industry|Swanscombe]] and the [[Medway Towns]] provided some minerals traffic, but again it was only after the foundation of [[Blue Circle Industries]] in 1900 that this was developed. Similarly, the [[Kent coalfield]] was not discovered until 1890 and only developed in the early twentieth century.\n\n===Passenger services===\nAs mentioned above, the SER was accused during the 1880s of concentrating on its [[Boat train]]s and Continental passenger traffic at the expense of its local services in Kent and the London suburbs.\n\n====London suburban services====\nOne area where the SER did fail compared with the LB&SCR and the L&SWR was in developing effective services to the rapidly growing suburbs of south east London. This was probably due to an unwillingness to generate even more traffic through the very restricted entry pathway into London between [[Deptford]] and London Bridge. The SER did however have the advantage of taking commuters far closer to the centres of business and commerce at Charing Cross and Cannon Street, whereas the LB&SCR and LS&WR deposited them south of the river Thames at London Bridge and [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo]] respectively.\n\n====Holiday traffic====\nThe SER served an area with a long coastline within easy travelling distance of London. During the 1860s the railway was an important factor in the development of holiday destinations such as [[Margate]] and [[Ramsgate]] in Kent and [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] and [[Hastings]] in East Sussex.\n\n====Continental excursions====\nIn May 1844 the SER organised the first of seven rail and ferry excursions that year from London to Boulogne which together carried more than 2,000 people.<ref>Christian Wolmar, Fire and steam: a new history of the railways in Britain, London, Atlantic Books, 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84354-629-0}} p.80.</ref>\n\n====Hop picking====\nBy the 1870s, the South Eastern Railway was running [[Hopper hut|Hop Pickers' Specials]] to transport large numbers of working-class Londoners to towns and villages in Kent and East Sussex for the season.\n\n==Communications, Signalling and Accidents==\n\n===Electric telegraph===\n[[Electric telegraph]] was installed throughout the SER by 1848.<ref name=\"Topham 1848 p.7\"/> These were sold to the [[General Post Office]] for \u00a3200,000 in 1870<ref>Sekon (1895), p.30.</ref> ({{Inflation|UK|200000|1870|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}\n\n===Signals and signal boxes===\n[[File:Borough Market Junction signal box National Railway Museum (1).jpg|thumb|Borough Market Junction signal box, a South Eastern Railway Type design on display outside the station hall at the National Railway Museum, York.]]\n\n===Accidents===\nThe SER did not have a good safety record with a large number of both major and minor accidents throughout its independent existence.\n\nOne of the most notable accidents occurred on 9 June 1865, when the [[boat train]] from [[Folkestone]] ran onto a partly dismantled bridge near [[Staplehurst]]. The locomotive and tender ran across the timber baulks to reach the far side, but the carriages were derailed and fell into the [[River Beult]]. The [[Staplehurst rail crash]] killed ten passengers and [[Charles Dickens]] narrowly avoided severe injury, or even death. He was travelling with [[Nelly Ternan]] and her mother at the front of the train in a first-class carriage, which escaped complete derailment when the locomotive and tender left the track as a result of repairs to the line. Timber baulks under the track were being replaced but the foreman mis-read the timetable, and two lengths of rail were missing on the viaduct. As the lead vehicles left the line, the impact on the remaining beams caused the cast iron girders below to fracture, and most of the following vehicles left the viaduct and ended up in the River Beult some {{convert|15|ft|m|1}} below. The foreman was indicted and convicted of [[manslaughter]], and served 6 months hard labour for his crime.<ref name=\"Sekon 1895, p.19\">Sekon (1895), p.19.</ref>\n\nOther significant accidents involving multiple fatalities were as follows:\n* 11 December 1844 the boiler explosion of locomotive No. 78 ''Forrester'' caused a bridge collapse near Bricklayers Arms, [[Surrey]] and killed two staff.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/eventsummary.php?eventID=1651 |title = Accident at Bricklayers Arms on 11th December 1844 :: The Railways Archive}}</ref><ref>Hewison (1983) pp.27-28.</ref>\n* 21 August 1854 a collision at [[East Croydon railway station]] killed three passengers.

The locomotives were then under the supervision of [[Benjamin Cubitt]] at [[New Cross Gate railway station|New Cross Depot]]. In the latter month the pool was also joined by the L&BR. However all three railways felt themselves disadvantaged by the arrangement and in October 1844 the SER gave notice six months notice of withdrawal, which was later extended until 31 January 1846.<ref>Bradley (1969), pp.26-8.</ref> The existing locomotives and carriages, and those on order, were divided between the three companies.\n\n===Steam locomotives===\nThe SER owned fifteen locomotives and had a further eleven on order at the formation of the 'London & Croydon and South Eastern Railways Joint Committee' in 1842.<ref>Bradley (1963), pp. 7-13.</ref> Ten locomotives were built by this committee, and a further 45 were either built or ordered by the enlarged [[Brighton, Croydon and Dover Joint Committee]]. The SER received 67 of these existing locomotives at the dissolution of the latter committee in 1846.<ref>Baxter (1977) p.69.</ref> Having decided to withdraw from the locomotive pool, the SER appointed [[James Cudworth]] as Locomotive Superintendent on 22 May 1845. Four locomotives were acquired from the 'Gravesend and Rochester Railway in 1847,<ref>Bradley (1963), p.37.</ref> seven from the L&GR in 1848, but the [[Invicta (locomotive)|only original locomotive]] to work the [[Canterbury and Whitstable Railway]] was not added to stock.<ref>Baxter (1977) p.67.</ref> Between 1846 and 1898 the SER built or purchased 775 locomotives.<ref>Baxter (1977). pp.67-8.</ref> Of these, 459 were running on 31 December 1898 when they were handed over to the SE&CR.<ref>Bradley (1963), p.120.</ref>\n\nUnder Cudworth the railway was the largest British user of the experimental and ultimately unsuccessful [[Crampton locomotive]] type with twenty examples built between 1847 and 1851.<ref>Bradley (1963), pp. 43, and 44-53.</ref> He also patented a double-[[firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] which enabled locomotives to burn cheaper coal without smoke, but were considerably more expensive to build and maintain.<ref>Nock (1987), pp.7-8.</ref> Cudworth also provided several sound locomotive types for the railway, but resigned in 1876 after Sir Edward Watkin ordered 20 express locomotives against Cudworth's wishes, which subsequently proved to have been unsuccessful.<ref>Marshall (1978), p.62.</ref>\n\nAfter a brief interregnum [[James Stirling (1835\u20131917)|James Stirling]] was appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer on 28 March 1878. He modernised the locomotive stock and was responsible for the building or acquisition of 401 locomotives.<ref>Bradley (1961), p.119.</ref> Stirling designed some good quality locomotive classes, notably his [[SER R class|R]] [[0-6-0]], and [[SER Q class|Q]] [[0-4-4]] tank classes, and his [[SER O class|O]] [[0-6-0]] and [[SER F class|F]] [[4-4-0]] tender classes. However his determination to maintain standardisation meant that the introduction of larger locomotives was delayed too long and the SER locomotive fleet was underpowered by 1899.<ref>Marshall (1978), p.206.</ref> As a result, future SE&CR locomotive practice was based on developing LCDR rather than SER designs.\n\n== Locomotive Superintendents ==\n* - 1845 -   [[Benjamin Cubitt]]\n*1845 - 1876 [[James I'Anson Cudworth]]\n*1876 -      [[Alfred Mellor Watkin]]\n*1876 - 1878 [[Richard Mansell]]\n*1878 - 1898 [[James Stirling (1835-1917)|James Stirling]]\n\n==Ships==\nThe South Eastern Railway operated a number of ships from [[Folkestone]] and [[Dover]] to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], [[France]] and [[Ostend]], [[Belgium]].

When Jalaluddin became the Sultan of Delhi after deposing the [[Mamluk dynasty (Delhi)|Mamluks]], Alauddin was given the position of ''Amir-i-Tuzuk'' (equivalent to [[master of ceremonies]]). Alauddin obtained the governorship of [[Kara-Manikpur|Kara]] in 1291 after suppressing a revolt against Jalaluddin, and the governorship of [[Awadh]] in 1296 after a profitable [[Alauddin Khalji's raid on Bhilsa|raid on Bhilsa]]. In 1296, Alauddin [[Alauddin Khalji's raid on Devagiri|raided Devagiri]], and acquired loot to stage a successful revolt against Jalaluddin. After killing Jalaluddin, he consolidated his power in Delhi, and subjugated Jalaluddin's sons in [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Multan|Multan]].\n\nOver the next few years, Alauddin successfully fended off the [[Mongol invasions of India|Mongol invasions]] from the [[Chagatai Khanate]], at [[Mongol invasion of India, 1297-98|Jaran-Manjur]] (1297\u20131298), [[Mongol invasion of Sindh|Sivistan]] (1298), [[Battle of Kili|Kili]] (1299), [[Mongol invasion of India, 1303|Delhi]] (1303), and [[Battle of Amroha|Amroha]] (1305). In 1306, his forces achieved a decisive victory against the Mongols near the [[Mongol invasion of India, 1306|Ravi riverbank]], and later ransacked the Mongol territories in present-day [[Afghanistan]]. The military commanders that successfully led his army against the Mongols include [[Zafar Khan (Indian general)|Zafar Khan]], [[Ulugh Khan]], and his slave-general [[Malik Kafur]].\n\nAlauddin conquered the kingdoms of [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Gujarat|Gujarat]] (raided in 1299 and annexed in 1304), [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Ranthambore|Ranthambore]] (1301), [[Siege of Chittorgarh (1303)|Chittor]] (1303), [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Malwa|Malwa]] (1305), [[Siege of Siwana|Siwana]] (1308), and [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Jalore|Jalore]] (1311). These victories ended several Hindu dynasties, including the [[Paramara]]s, the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghelas]], the Chahamanas of [[Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura|Ranastambhapura]] and [[Chahamanas of Jalor|Jalore]], the Rawal branch of the [[Guhila dynasty|Guhilas]], and possibly the [[Yajvapala dynasty|Yajvapalas]]. His slave-general Malik Kafur led multiple campaigns to the south of the [[Vindhyas]], obtaining a considerable amount of wealth from [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Devagiri|Devagiri]] (1308), [[Siege of Warangal, 1310|Warangal]] (1310) and [[Siege of Dwarasamudra|Dwarasamudra]] (1311). These victories forced the [[Yadavas of Devagiri|Yadava]] king [[Ramachandra of Devagiri|Ramachandra]], the [[Kakatiya]] king [[Prataparudra]], and the [[Hoysala]] king [[Veera Ballala III|Ballala III]] to become Alauddin's [[tributary state|tributaries]]. Kafur also [[Malik Kafur's invasion of the Pandya kingdom|raided the Pandya kingdom]] (1311), obtaining much treasure and many elephants and horses.\n\nAt times, Alauddin exploited Muslim fanaticism against Hindu chieftains and the treatment of the ''[[dhimmi|zimmis]]''. He rarely heeded to the orthodox ''[[ulema]]'' but believed \"that the Hindu will never be submissive and obedient to the Musalman.\" He undertook measures to impoverish them and felt it was justified because he knew the Hindu chiefs and ''[[muqaddam]]s'' led a luxurious life but didn't pay a ''jital'' in taxes. Under the [[Mamluk dynasty (Delhi)|Mamluks]], Hindus were deprived of positions in higher bureaucracy. However, [[Amir Khusrau]] mentions a Hindu officer of his army despatched to repel the Mongols. In addition, many non-Muslims served in his army.\n\nDuring the last years of his life, Alauddin suffered from an illness, and relied on Malik Kafur to handle the administration. After his death in 1316, Malik Kafur appointed [[Shihab-ud-din Omar|Shihabuddin]], son of Alauddin and his Hindu wife Jhatyapali, as a [[puppet monarch]]. However, his elder son [[Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah|Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah]] seized the power shortly after his death.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nContemporary chroniclers did not write much about Alauddin's childhood. According to the 16th/17th-century chronicler Haji-ud-Dabir, Alauddin was 34 years old when he started his march to Ranthambore (1300\u20131301). Assuming this is correct, Alauddin's birth can be dated to 1266\u20131267.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|pp=40\u201341}} His original name was Ali Gurshasp. He was the eldest son of Shihabuddin Mas'ud, who was the elder brother of the [[Khalji dynasty]]'s founder Sultan [[Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji|Jalaluddin]]. He had three brothers: [[Almas Beg]] (later Ulugh Khan), Qutlugh Tigin and Muhammad.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=326}}\n\nAlauddin was brought up by Jalaluddin after Shihabuddin's death.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=321}} Both Alauddin and his younger brother Almas Beg married Jalaluddin's daughters. After Jalaluddin became the Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin was appointed as ''Amir-i-Tuzuk'' (equivalent to [[Master of ceremonies]]), while Almas Beg was given the post of ''Akhur-beg'' (equivalent to [[Master of the Horse]]).{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=41}}\n\n===Marriage to Jalaluddin's daughter===\nAlauddin married Jalaluddin's daughter, [[Malika-i-Jahan (wife of Alauddin Khalji)|Malika-i-Jahan]], long before the Khalji revolution of 1290. The marriage, however, was not a happy one. Having suddenly become a princess after Jalaluddin's rise as a monarch, she was very arrogant and tried to dominate Alauddin. According to Haji-ud-Dabir, Alauddin married a second woman, named Mahru, who was the sister of Malik Sanjar alias [[Alp Khan]].{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=42}} Malika-i-Jahan was greatly infuriated by the fact that her husband had taken a second wife. According to Dabir, this was the main cause of misunderstanding between Alauddin and his first wife.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=42}} Once, while Alauddin and Mahru were together in a garden, Jalaluddin's daughter attacked Mahru out of jealousy. In response, Alauddin assaulted her. The incident was reported to Jalaluddin, but the Sultan did not take any action against Alauddin.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=41}} Alauddin was not on good terms with his mother-in-law either, who wielded great influence over the Sultan. According to the 16th-century historian [[Firishta]], she warned Jalaluddin that Alauddin was planning to set up an independent kingdom in a remote part of the country. She kept a close watch on Alauddin, and encouraged her daughter's arrogant behavior towards him.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=43}}\n\n===Governor of Kara===\n\nIn 1291, Alauddin played an important role in crushing a revolt by the governor of [[Kara, Uttar Pradesh|Kara]] Malik Chajju. As a result, Jalaluddin appointed him as the new governor of Kara in 1291.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=41}} Malik Chajju's former ''[[Emir|Amirs]]'' (subordinate nobles) at Kara considered Jalaluddin as a weak and ineffective ruler, and instigated Alauddin to usurp the throne of Delhi.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=42}} This, combined with his unhappy domestic life, made Alauddin determined to dethrone Jalaluddin.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=321}}\n\n== Conspiracy against Jalaluddin ==\n[[File:THE ARMY OF ALA-UD-DEEN ON THE MARCH.gif|thumb|''The army of Alaudeen on March to Deccan'', a 20th-century [[artist's impression]]]]\nWhile instigating Alauddin to revolt against Jalaluddin, Malik Chajju's supporters emphasized that he needed a lot of money to raise a large army and stage a successful coup: Malik Chajju's revolt had failed for want of resources.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=42}} To finance his plan to dethrone Jalaluddin, Alauddin decided to raid the neighbouring Hindu kingdoms. In 1293, he [[Alauddin Khalji's raid on Bhilsa|raided Bhilsa]], a wealthy town in the [[Paramara]] kingdom of [[Malwa]], which had been weakened by multiple invasions.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=321}} At Bhilsa, he came to know about the immense wealth of the southern [[Yadavas of Devagiri|Yadava kingdom]] in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region, as well as about the routes leading to their capital [[Devagiri]]. Therefore, he shrewdly surrendered the loot from Bhilsa to Jalaluddin to win the Sultan's confidence, while withholding the information on the Yadava kingdom.{{sfn|A. B. M. Habibullah|1992|p=322}} A pleased Jalaluddin gave him the office of ''Ariz-i Mamalik'' (Minister of War), and also made him the governor of [[Awadh]].{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=45}} In addition, the Sultan granted Alauddin's request to use the revenue surplus for hiring additional troops.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=322}}\n\nAfter years of planning and preparation, Alauddin successfully [[Alauddin Khalji's raid on Devagiri|raided Devagiri]] in 1296. He left Devagiri with a huge amount of wealth, including precious metals, jewels, silk products, elephants, horses, and slaves.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=322\u2013323}} When the news of Alauddin's success reached Jalaluddin, the Sultan came to [[Gwalior]], hoping that Alauddin would present the loot to him there. However, Alauddin marched directly to Kara with all the wealth. Jalaluddin's advisors such as Ahmad Chap recommended intercepting Alauddin at Chanderi, but Jalaluddin had faith in his nephew. He returned to Delhi, believing that Alauddin would carry the wealth from Kara to Delhi. After reaching Kara, Alauddin sent a letter of apology to the Sultan, and expressed concern that his enemies may have poisoned the Sultan's mind against him during his absence. He requested a letter of pardon signed by the Sultan, which the Sultan immediately despatched through messengers. At Kara, Jalaluddin's messengers learned of Alauddin's military strength and of his plans to dethrone the Sultan. However, Alauddin detained them, and prevented them from communicating with the Sultan.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=323}}\n\nMeanwhile, Alauddin's younger brother Almas Beg (later Ulugh Khan), who was married to a daughter of Jalaluddin, assured the Sultan of Alauddin's loyalty. He convinced Jalaluddin to visit Kara and meet Alauddin, saying that Alauddin would commit suicide out of guilt if the Sultan didn't pardon him personally. A gullible Jalaluddin set out for Kara with his army. After reaching close to Kara, he directed Ahmad Chap to take his main army to Kara by the land route, while he himself decided to cross the [[Ganges river]] with a smaller body of around 1,000 soldiers. On 20 July 1296, Alauddin had Jalaluddin killed after pretending to greet the Sultan, and declared himself the new king. Jalaluddin's companions were also killed, while Ahmad Chap's army retreated to Delhi.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=324}}\n\n== Ascension and march to Delhi ==\n[[File:Delhi Sultanate under Jalaluddin Khalji - based on A Historical Atlas of South Asia.svg|thumb|280px|Extent of the Delhi Sultanate at the time of Jalaluddin Khalji's ascension (1290)]]\nAlauddin, known as Ali Gurshasp until his ascension in July 1296, was formally proclaimed as the new king with the title ''Alauddunya wad Din Muhammad Shah-us Sultan'' at [[Kara, Uttar Pradesh|Kara]]. Meanwhile, the head of Jalaluddin was paraded on a spear in his camp before being sent to [[Awadh]].{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=326}} Over the next two days, Alauddin formed a provisional government at Kara. He promoted the existing ''[[Emir|Amirs]]'' to the rank of ''[[Malik]]s'', and appointed his close friends as the new ''Amirs''.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=327}}\n\nAt that time, there were heavy rains, and the [[Ganga]] and the [[Yamuna]] rivers were flooded. But Alauddin made preparations for a march to Delhi, and ordered his officers to recruit as many soldiers as possible, without fitness tests or [[background check]]s.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=327}} His objective was to cause a change in the general political opinion, by portraying himself as someone with huge public support.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=328}} To portray himself as a generous king, he ordered 5 [[mann (unit)#Persia|manns]] of gold pieces to be shot from a ''manjaniq'' ([[catapult]]) at a crowd in Kara.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=327}}\n\nOne section of his army, led by himself and [[Nusrat Khan Jalesari|Nusrat Khan]], marched to Delhi via [[Badaun]] and Baran (modern [[Bulandshahr]]). The other section, led by [[Zafar Khan (Indian general)|Zafar Khan]], marched to Delhi via [[Kol Tehsil|Koil]] (modern [[Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh|Aligarh]]).{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=327}} As Alauddin marched to Delhi, the news spread in towns and villages that he was recruiting soldiers while distributing gold. Many people, from both military and non-military backgrounds, joined him. By the time he reached Badaun, he had a 56,000-strong cavalry and a 60,000-strong infantry.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=327}} At Baran, Alauddin was joined by seven powerful Jalaluddin's nobles who had earlier opposed him. These nobles were Tajul Mulk Kuchi, Malik Abaji Akhur-bek, Malik Amir Ali Diwana, Malik Usman Amir-akhur, Malik Amir Khan, Malik Umar Surkha and Malik Hiranmar. Alauddin gave each of them 30 to 50 ''mann''s of gold, and each of their soldiers 300 silver ''tanka''s (hammered coins).{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=328}}\n\nAlauddin's march to Delhi was interrupted by the flooding of the Yamuna river. Meanwhile, in Delhi, Jalaluddin's widow ''Malka-i-Jahan'' appointed her youngest son Qadr Khan as the new king with the title Ruknuddin Ibrahim, without consulting the nobles. This irked Arkali Khan, her elder son and the governor of [[Multan]]. When ''Malika-i-Jahan'' heard that Jalaluddin's nobles had joined Alauddin, she apologized to Arkali and offered him the throne, requesting him to march from Multan to Delhi. However, Arkali refused to come to her aid.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=328}}\n\nAlauddin resumed his march to Delhi in the second week of October 1296, when the Yamuna river subsided. When he reached [[Siri Fort|Siri]], Ruknuddin led an army against him. However, a section of Ruknuddin's army defected to Alauddin at midnight.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=328}} A dejected Ruknuddin then retreated and escaped to Multan with his mother and the loyal nobles. Alauddin then entered the city, where a number of nobles and officials accepted his authority. On 21 October 1296, Alauddin was formally proclaimed as the Sultan in Delhi.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=329}}\n\n== Consolidation of power ==\n\nInitially, Alauddin consolidated power by making generous grants and endowments, and appointing many people to government positions.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=330}} He balanced the power between the officers appointed by the [[Mamluk Dynasty (Delhi)|Mamluks]], the ones appointed by Jalaluddin, and his own appointees.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=329}} He also increased the strength of the Sultanate's army, and gifted every soldier the salary of a year and a half in cash. Of Alauddin's first year as the Sultan, chronicler [[Ziauddin Barani]] wrote that it was the happiest year that the people of Delhi had ever seen.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=330}}\n\nAt this time, Alauddin's could not exercise his authority over all of Jalaluddin's former territories. In the [[Punjab region]], his authority was limited to the areas east of the [[Ravi river]]. The region beyond [[Lahore]] suffered from [[Mongol invasions of India|Mongol raids]] and [[Khokhar]] rebellions. [[Multan]] was controlled by Jalaluddin's son Arkali, who harboured the fugitives from Delhi.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=330}} In November 1296, Alauddin sent an army led by [[Ulugh Khan]] and [[Zafar Khan (Indian general)|Zafar Khan]] to [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Multan|conquer Multan]]. On his orders, Nusrat Khan arrested, blinded and/or killed the surviving members of Jalaluddin's family.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=331}}{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=79}}\n\nShortly after the conquest of Multan, Alauddin appointed Nusrat Khan as his ''[[vizier|wazir]]'' (prime minister).{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=80}} Having strengthened his control over Delhi, the Sultan started eliminating the officers that were not his own appointees.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=332}} In 1297,{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=85}} the aristocrats (''[[malik]]s''), who had deserted Jalaluddin's family to join Alauddin, were arrested, blinded or killed. All their property, including the money earlier given to them by Alauddin, was confiscated. As a result of these confiscations, Nusrat Khan obtained a huge amount of cash for the royal treasury. Only three ''malik''s from Jalaluddin's time were spared: Malik Qutbuddin Alavi, Malik Nasiruddin Rana, Malik Amir Jamal Khalji.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=333}} The rest of the older aristocrats were replaced with the new nobles, who were extremely loyal to Alauddin.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=81}}\n\nMeanwhile, Ala-ul Mulk, who was Alaudidn's governor at Kara, came to Delhi with all the officers, elephants and wealth that Alauddin had left at Kara. Alauddin appointed Ala-ul Mulk as the [[kotwal]] of Delhi, and placed all the non-Turkic municipal employees under his charge.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=332}} Since Ala-ul Mulk had become very [[obesity|obese]], the fief of Kara was entrusted to Nusrat Khan, who had become unpopular in Delhi because of the confiscations.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=81}}\n\n== Mongol invasions and northern conquests, 1297\u20131306 ==\n\nIn the winter of 1297, the [[Mongols]] led by a [[noyan]] of the [[Chagatai Khanate]] raided Punjab, advancing as far as [[Kasur]]. Alauddin's forces, led by Ulugh Khan, [[Mongol invasion of India, 1297-98|defeated the Mongols]] on 6 February 1298. According to [[Amir Khusrow]], 20,000 Mongols were killed in the battle, and many more were killed in Delhi after being brought there as prisoners.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=221}} In 1298\u201399, another Mongol army (possibly [[Neguderi]] fugitives) [[Mongol invasion of Sindh|invaded Sindh]], and occupied the fort of [[Sehwan Sharif|Sivistan]]. This time, Alauddin's general [[Zafar Khan (Indian general)|Zafar Khan]] defeated the invaders, and recaptured the fort.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|pp=219\u2013220}}{{sfn|Mohammad Habib|1981|p=266}}\n\nIn early 1299, Alauddin sent Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan to [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Gujarat|invade Gujarat]], where the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] king [[Karna (Vaghela dynasty)|Karna]] offered a weak resistance. Alauddin's army plundered several towns including [[Somnath]], where it desecrated the famous Hindu temple. The Delhi army also captured several people, including the Vaghela queen Kamala Devi and  slave [[Malik Kafur]], who later led Alauddin's southern campaigns.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|pp=84-86}}{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=334-335}} During the army's return journey to Delhi, some of its Mongol soldiers staged an unsuccessful mutiny near [[Jalore]], after the generals forcibly tried to extract a share of loot (''[[khums]]'') from them. Alauddin's administration meted out brutal punishments to the mutineers' families in Delhi, including killings of children in front of their mothers.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=88}} According to [[Ziauddin Barani]], the practice of punishing wives and children for the crimes of men started with this incident in Delhi.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=335}}\n\nIn 1299, the Chagatai ruler [[Duwa]] sent a Mongol force led by [[Qutlugh Khwaja]] to conquer Delhi.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=338}} In the ensuing [[Battle of Kili]], Alauddin personally led the Delhi forces, but his general Zafar Khan attacked the Mongols without waiting for his orders.

He viewed their haughtiness and their direct and indirect resistance as the main difficulty affecting his reign. He also had to face talk of conspiracies at his court.{{sfn|Hermann Kulke|Dietmar Rothermund|2004|p=171-173}}\n\nAfter some initial conspiracies and Hindu revolts in rural areas during the early period of his reign, he struck the root of the problem by introducing reforms that also aimed at ensuring support of his army and food supply to his capital. He took away all landed properties of his courtiers and nobels and cancelled revenue assignments which were henceforth controlled by the central authorities. Henceforth, \"everybody was busy earning with earning a living so that nobody could even think of rebellion\". He also ordered \"to supply some rules and regulations for grinding down the Hindus, and for depriving them of that wealth and property which fosters rebellion. The Hindu was to be reduced to be so reduced as to be unable to keep a horse to ride on, wear fine clothes, or to enjoy any luxuries of life.\"{{sfn|Hermann Kulke|Dietmar Rothermund|2004|p=171-173}}\n\nAlauddin brought a large tract of fertile land under the directly-governed crown territory, by eliminating [[iqta']]s, [[land grant]]s and vassals in the [[Ganga-Yamuna Doab]] region.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2007|p=102}} He imposed a 50% ''[[kharaj]]'' tax on the agricultural produce in a substantial part of northern India: this was the maximum amount allowed by the [[Hanafi]] school of Islam, which was dominant in Delhi at that time.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=242}}\n\n{{quote|Alauddin Khalji's taxation system was probably the one institution from his reign that lasted the longest, surviving indeed into the nineteenth or even the twentieth century.

His government recruited many accountants, collectors and agents. These officials were well-paid but were subject to severe punishment if found to be taking bribes. Account books were audited and even small discrepancies were punished. The effect was both large landowners and small-scale cultivators were fearful of missing out on paying their assessed taxes.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2004|p=80}}\n\nAlauddin's government imposed the ''[[jizya]]'' tax on its non-Muslim subjects, and his Muslim subjects were obligated to contribute ''[[zakat]]''.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=250}} He also levied taxes on residences (''ghari'') and [[grazing]] (''chara'i''), which were not sanctioned by the Islamic law.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=243}} In addition, Alauddin demanded four-fifth share of the spoils of war from his soldiers, instead of the traditional one-fifth share (''[[khums]]'').{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=250}}\n\n=== Market reforms ===\n\n{{main|Market reforms of Alauddin Khalji}}\n\nAlauddin implemented [[price control]] measures for a wide variety of market goods.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2007|p=105}} Alauddin's courtier [[Amir Khusrau]] and the 14th century writer Hamid Qalandar suggest that Alauddin introduced these changes for public welfare.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=374\u2013376}} However, Barani states that Alauddin wanted to reduce the prices so that low salaries were acceptable to his soldiers, and thus, to maintain a large army.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2014|p=103}}{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=166}} In addition, Barani suggests that the Hindu traders indulged in [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]], and Alauddin's market reforms resulted from the Sultan's desire to punish the Hindus.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2007|p=104}}\n\nTo ensure that the goods were sold at regulated prices, Alauddin appointed market supervisors and spies, and received independent reports from them. To prevent a [[black market]], his administration prohibited peasants and traders from storing the grains, and established government-run granaries, where government's share of the grain was stored. The government also forced the transport workers to re-settle in villages at specific distances along the Yamuna river to enable rapid transport of grain to Delhi.{{sfn|Hermann Kulke|Dietmar Rothermund|2004|p=173}}\n\nChroniclers such as Khusrau and Barani state that the prices were not allowed to increase during Alauddin's lifetime, even when the rainfall was scarce.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=379}} The shopkeepers who violated the price control regulations or tried to circumvent them (such as, by using false weights) were given severe punishments.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=387}}\n\n=== Military reforms ===\n\nAlauddin maintained a large [[standing army]], which included 475,000 horseman according to the 16th-century chronicler [[Firishta]].{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=257}} He managed to raise such a large army by paying relatively low salaries to his soldiers, and introduced [[market reforms of Alauddin Khalji|market price controls]] to ensure that the low salaries were acceptable to his soldiers.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=166}} Although he was opposed to granting lands to his generals and soldiers, he generously rewarded them after successful campaigns, especially those in [[Deccan]].{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=260}}\n\nAlauddin's government maintained a descriptive roll of every soldier, and occasionally conducted strict reviews of the army to examine the horses and arms of the soldiers. To ensure that no horse could be presented twice or replaced by a poor-quality horse during the review, Alauddin established a system of [[Livestock branding|branding]] the horses.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|pp=256\u2013257}}\n\n=== Social reforms ===\n\n{{main|Rebellions against Alauddin Khalji#Measures for preventing rebellions}}\n\nAlthough Islam bans [[alcoholic drink]]s, drinking was common among the Muslim royals and nobles of the Delhi Sultanate in the 13th century, and Alauddin himself was a heavy drinker. As part of his measures to prevent rebellions, Alauddin imposed [[prohibition]], because he believed that the rampant use of alcoholic drinks enabled people to assemble, lose their senses and think of rebellion. According to [[Isami (historian)|Isami]], Alauddin banned alcohol, after a noble condemned him for merrymaking when his subjects were suffering from a famine. However, this account appears to be hearsay.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=261}}\n\nSubsequently, Alauddin also banned other intoxicants, including [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=261}} He also banned [[gambling]], and excommunicated drunkards and gamblers from Delhi, along with vendors of intoxicants.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=262}} Alauddin's administration strictly punished the violators, and ensured non-availability of alcohol not only in Delhi, but also in its surrounding areas. Nevertheless, alcohol continued to be illegally produced in and smuggled into Delhi.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|pp=262\u2013263}} Sometime later, Alauddin relented, and allowed distillation and drinking in private. However, public distribution and drinking of wine remained prohibited.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=263}}\n\nAlauddin also increased his level of control over the nobility. To prevent rebellions by the nobles, he confiscated their wealth and removed them from their bases of power. Even charitable lands administered by nobles were confiscated. Severe punishments were given for disloyalty. Even wives and children of soldiers rebelling for greater war spoils were imprisoned. An efficient spy network was set up that reached into the private households of nobles. Marriage alliances made between noble families had to be approved by the king.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2004|p=76-77}}\n\nAlauddin banned [[prostitution]], and ordered all existing prostitutes of Delhi to be married.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=262}} Firishta states that he classified prostitutes into three grades, and fixed their fees accordingly. However, historian Kishori Saran Lal dismisses this account as inaccurate. Alauddin also took steps to curb [[adultery]] by ordering the male adulterer to be castrated and the female adulterer to be [[stoning|stoned to death]].{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=264}}\n\nAlauddin banned [[charlatan]]s, and ordered [[magic (paranormal)|sorcerers]] (called \"blood-sucking magicians\" by his courtier Amir Khusrau) to be stoned to death.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=265}}\n\n== Last days ==\n[[File:Tomb of Alauddin Khilji, Qutub Minar complex, Delhi.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Alauddin Khalji, [[Qutb complex]], Delhi.]]\n\nDuring the last years of his life, Alauddin suffered from an illness, and became very distrustful of his officers. He started concentrating all the power in the hands of his family and his slaves.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=176}}  He became infatuated with his slave-general [[Malik Kafur]], who became the de facto ruler of the Sultanate after being promoted to the rank of viceroy (''Na'ib'').{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=177-8}}{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1970|p=421}}\n\nAlauddin removed several experienced administrators, abolished the office of ''[[vizier|wazir]]'' (prime minister), and even executed the minister Sharaf Qa'ini. It appears that Malik Kafur, who considered these officers as his rivals and a threat, convinced Alauddin to carry out this purge.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=176}} Kafur had Alauddin's eldest sons Khizr Khan and Shadi Khan blinded. He also convinced Alauddin to order the killing of his brother-in-law Alp Khan, an influential noble who could rival Malik Kafur's power. The victims allegedly hatched a conspiracy to overthrow Alauddin, but this might be Kafur's propaganda.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=176}}\n\nAlauddin died on the night of 4 January 1316.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1970|p=425}} Barani claims that according to \"some people\", Kafur murdered him.{{sfn|R.

Gradually, it became filled with mud, and was [[silt|desilted]] by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]] around 1354. The autobiographical memoirs of [[Timur]], who invaded Delhi in 1398, mention that the reservoir was a source of water for the city throughout the year.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=375}}\n\nIn the early years of the 14th century, Alauddin built the [[Siri Fort]]. The fort walls were mainly constructed using [[rubble]] (in mud), although there are some traces of [[ashlar]] [[masonry]] (in [[lime (material)|lime]] and [[lime plaster]]).{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=375}} Alauddin camped in Siri during the [[Mongol invasion of India, 1303|1303 Mongol invasion]], and after the Mongols left, he built the Qasr-i-Hazar Situn palace at the site of his camp. The fortified city of Siri existed in the time of Timur, whose memoirs state that it had seven gates.

His administration persecuted the [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] ([[Shia]]) minorities, after the orthodox Sunnis falsely accused them of permitting incest in their \"secret assemblies\". Alauddin ordered an inquiry against them sometime before 1311. The inquiry was conducted by the orthodox ''[[ulama]]'', who found several Ismailis guilty. Alauddin ordered the convicts to be [[saw]]n into two.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=399}}\n\n[[Ziauddin Barani]], writing half-a-century after his death, mentions that Alauddin did not patronize the Muslim ''ulama'', and that \"his faith in [[Islam]] was firm like the faith of the illiterate and the ignorant\". He further states that Alauddin once thought of establishing a new religion. Just like the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]'s four [[Rashidun]] [[caliph]]s helped spread Islam, Alauddin believed that he too had four [[Khan (title)|Khans]] ([[Ulugh Khan|Ulugh]], [[Nusrat Khan Jalesari|Nusrat]], [[Zafar Khan (Indian general)|Zafar]] and [[Alp Khan|Alp]]), with whose help he could establish a new religion.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=336\u2013337}} Barani's uncle Alaul Mulk convinced him to drop this idea, stating that a new religion could only be found based on a revelation from god, not based on human wisdom.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=90}} Alaul Mulk also argued that even great conquerors like [[Genghis Khan]] had not been able to subvert Islam, and people would revolt against Alauddin for founding a new religion.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=91}} Barani's claim that Alauddin thought of founding a religion has been repeated by several later chroniclers as well as later historians. Historian [[Banarsi Prasad Saksena]] doubts the authenticity of this claim, arguing that it is not supported by Alauddin's contemporary writers.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=336\u2013337}}\n\nAccording to Barani, Alauddin was the first sultan to separate religion from the state. Barani wrote that he:<ref name=Mehta/>\n\n{{blockquote|came to the conclusion that polity and government are one thing, and the rules and decrees of law are another.

These temples included the ones at [[Bhilsa]] (1292), [[Devagiri]] (1295), [[Vijapur]] (1298\u20131310), [[Somnath]] (1299), [[Jhain]] (1301), [[Chidambaram]] (1311) and [[Madurai]] (1311).{{sfn|Richard M. Eaton|2001|pp=72\u201373}}\n\nHe compromised with the Hindu chiefs who were willing to accept his suzerainty. In a 1305 document, Khusrau mentions that Alauddin treated the obedient Hindu [[zamindar]]s (feudal landlords) kindly, and granted more favours to them than they had expected. In his poetic style, Khusrau states that by this time, all the insolent Hindus in the realm of [[Hindustan|Hind]] had died on the battlefield, and the other Hindus had bowed their heads before Alauddin. Describing a court held on 19 October 1312, Khusrau writes the ground had become [[saffron (color)|saffron]]-coloured from the [[tilaka|tilaks]] of the Hindu chiefs bowing before Alauddin.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=354}} This policy of compromise with Hindus was greatly criticized by a small but vocal set of Muslim extremists, as apparent from Barani's writings.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=355\u2013356}}\n\nAlauddin rarely listened to the advice of the orthodox ulama. When he had asked about the position of Hindus under an Islamic state, the ''qazi'' Mughis replied that the Hindu \"should pay the taxes with meekness and humility coupled with the utmost respect and free from all reluctance. Should the collector choose to spit in his mouth, he should open the same without hesitation, so that the official may spit into it... The purport of this extreme meekness and humility on his part... is to show the extreme submissiveness incumbent upon this race. God Almighty Himself (in the Quran) commands their complete degradation in as much as these Hindus are the deadliest foes of the true prophet. [[Muhammad|Mustafa]] has given orders regarding the slaying, plundering and imprisoning of them, ordaining that they must either follow the true faith, or else be slain or imprisoned, and have all their wealth and property confiscated.\"<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|volume=9|title=Political conditions of the Hindus under the Khaljis|publisher=[[Indian History Congress]]|author=[[Kishori Saran Lal]]|pages= 234}}</ref>\n\nAlauddin believed \"that the Hindu will never be submissive and obedient to the Musalman unless he is reduced to abject poverty.\" He undertook measures to impoverish them and felt it was justified because he knew that the chiefs and ''[[muqaddam]]s'' led a luxurious life but never paid a jital in taxes.

Alauddin instituted a number of significant administrative changes, related to [[revenue reforms of Alauddin Khalji|revenues]], [[market reforms of Alauddin Khalji|price controls]], and [[rebellions against Alauddin Khalji#Measures for preventing rebellions|society]].   He is noted for thwarting the [[Mongol invasions of India]].\n\nAlauddin was a nephew and a son-in-law of his predecessor [[Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji|Jalaluddin]]. When Jalaluddin became the Sultan of Delhi after deposing the [[Mamluk dynasty (Delhi)|Mamluks]], Alauddin was given the position of ''Amir-i-Tuzuk'' (equivalent to [[master of ceremonies]]). Alauddin obtained the governorship of [[Kara-Manikpur|Kara]] in 1291 after suppressing a revolt against Jalaluddin, and the governorship of [[Awadh]] in 1296 after a profitable [[Alauddin Khalji's raid on Bhilsa|raid on Bhilsa]]. In 1296, Alauddin [[Alauddin Khalji's raid on Devagiri|raided Devagiri]], and acquired loot to stage a successful revolt against Jalaluddin. After killing Jalaluddin, he consolidated his power in Delhi, and subjugated Jalaluddin's sons in [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Multan|Multan]].\n\nOver the next few years, Alauddin successfully fended off the [[Mongol invasions of India|Mongol invasions]] from the [[Chagatai Khanate]], at [[Mongol invasion of India, 1297-98|Jaran-Manjur]] (1297\u20131298), [[Mongol invasion of Sindh|Sivistan]] (1298), [[Battle of Kili|Kili]] (1299), [[Mongol invasion of India, 1303|Delhi]] (1303), and [[Battle of Amroha|Amroha]] (1305). In 1306, his forces achieved a decisive victory against the Mongols near the [[Mongol invasion of India, 1306|Ravi riverbank]], and later ransacked the Mongol territories in present-day [[Afghanistan]]. The military commanders that successfully led his army against the Mongols include [[Zafar Khan (Indian general)|Zafar Khan]], [[Ulugh Khan]], and his slave-general [[Malik Kafur]].\n\nAlauddin conquered the kingdoms of [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Gujarat|Gujarat]] (raided in 1299 and annexed in 1304), [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Ranthambore|Ranthambore]] (1301), [[Siege of Chittorgarh (1303)|Chittor]] (1303), [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Malwa|Malwa]] (1305), [[Siege of Siwana|Siwana]] (1308), and [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Jalore|Jalore]] (1311). These victories ended several Hindu dynasties, including the [[Paramara]]s, the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghelas]], the Chahamanas of [[Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura|Ranastambhapura]] and [[Chahamanas of Jalor|Jalore]], the Rawal branch of the [[Guhila dynasty|Guhilas]], and possibly the [[Yajvapala dynasty|Yajvapalas]]. His slave-general Malik Kafur led multiple campaigns to the south of the [[Vindhyas]], obtaining a considerable amount of wealth from [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Devagiri|Devagiri]] (1308), [[Siege of Warangal, 1310|Warangal]] (1310) and [[Siege of Dwarasamudra|Dwarasamudra]] (1311). These victories forced the [[Yadavas of Devagiri|Yadava]] king [[Ramachandra of Devagiri|Ramachandra]], the [[Kakatiya]] king [[Prataparudra]], and the [[Hoysala]] king [[Veera Ballala III|Ballala III]] to become Alauddin's [[tributary state|tributaries]]. Kafur also [[Malik Kafur's invasion of the Pandya kingdom|raided the Pandya kingdom]] (1311), obtaining much treasure and many elephants and horses.\n\nAt times, Alauddin exploited Muslim fanaticism against Hindu chieftains and the treatment of the ''[[dhimmi|zimmis]]''. He rarely heeded to the orthodox ''[[ulema]]'' but believed \"that the Hindu will never be submissive and obedient to the Musalman.\" He undertook measures to impoverish them and felt it was justified because he knew the Hindu chiefs and ''[[muqaddam]]s'' led a luxurious life but didn't pay a ''jital'' in taxes. Under the [[Mamluk dynasty (Delhi)|Mamluks]], Hindus were deprived of positions in higher bureaucracy. However, [[Amir Khusrau]] mentions a Hindu officer of his army despatched to repel the Mongols. In addition, many non-Muslims served in his army.\n\nDuring the last years of his life, Alauddin suffered from an illness, and relied on Malik Kafur to handle the administration. After his death in 1316, Malik Kafur appointed [[Shihab-ud-din Omar|Shihabuddin]], son of Alauddin and his Hindu wife Jhatyapali, as a [[puppet monarch]]. However, his elder son [[Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah|Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah]] seized the power shortly after his death.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nContemporary chroniclers did not write much about Alauddin's childhood. According to the 16th/17th-century chronicler Haji-ud-Dabir, Alauddin was 34 years old when he started his march to Ranthambore (1300\u20131301). Assuming this is correct, Alauddin's birth can be dated to 1266\u20131267.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|pp=40\u201341}} His original name was Ali Gurshasp. He was the eldest son of Shihabuddin Mas'ud, who was the elder brother of the [[Khalji dynasty]]'s founder Sultan [[Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji|Jalaluddin]]. He had three brothers: [[Almas Beg]] (later Ulugh Khan), Qutlugh Tigin and Muhammad.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=326}}\n\nAlauddin was brought up by Jalaluddin after Shihabuddin's death.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=321}} Both Alauddin and his younger brother Almas Beg married Jalaluddin's daughters. After Jalaluddin became the Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin was appointed as ''Amir-i-Tuzuk'' (equivalent to [[Master of ceremonies]]), while Almas Beg was given the post of ''Akhur-beg'' (equivalent to [[Master of the Horse]]).{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=41}}\n\n===Marriage to Jalaluddin's daughter===\nAlauddin married Jalaluddin's daughter, [[Malika-i-Jahan (wife of Alauddin Khalji)|Malika-i-Jahan]], long before the Khalji revolution of 1290. The marriage, however, was not a happy one. Having suddenly become a princess after Jalaluddin's rise as a monarch, she was very arrogant and tried to dominate Alauddin. According to Haji-ud-Dabir, Alauddin married a second woman, named Mahru, who was the sister of Malik Sanjar alias [[Alp Khan]].{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=42}} Malika-i-Jahan was greatly infuriated by the fact that her husband had taken a second wife. According to Dabir, this was the main cause of misunderstanding between Alauddin and his first wife.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=42}} Once, while Alauddin and Mahru were together in a garden, Jalaluddin's daughter attacked Mahru out of jealousy. In response, Alauddin assaulted her. The incident was reported to Jalaluddin, but the Sultan did not take any action against Alauddin.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=41}} Alauddin was not on good terms with his mother-in-law either, who wielded great influence over the Sultan. According to the 16th-century historian [[Firishta]], she warned Jalaluddin that Alauddin was planning to set up an independent kingdom in a remote part of the country. She kept a close watch on Alauddin, and encouraged her daughter's arrogant behavior towards him.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=43}}\n\n===Governor of Kara===\n\nIn 1291, Alauddin played an important role in crushing a revolt by the governor of [[Kara, Uttar Pradesh|Kara]] Malik Chajju. As a result, Jalaluddin appointed him as the new governor of Kara in 1291.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=41}} Malik Chajju's former ''[[Emir|Amirs]]'' (subordinate nobles) at Kara considered Jalaluddin as a weak and ineffective ruler, and instigated Alauddin to usurp the throne of Delhi.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=42}} This, combined with his unhappy domestic life, made Alauddin determined to dethrone Jalaluddin.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=321}}\n\n== Conspiracy against Jalaluddin ==\n[[File:THE ARMY OF ALA-UD-DEEN ON THE MARCH.gif|thumb|''The army of Alaudeen on March to Deccan'', a 20th-century [[artist's impression]]]]\nWhile instigating Alauddin to revolt against Jalaluddin, Malik Chajju's supporters emphasized that he needed a lot of money to raise a large army and stage a successful coup: Malik Chajju's revolt had failed for want of resources.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=42}} To finance his plan to dethrone Jalaluddin, Alauddin decided to raid the neighbouring Hindu kingdoms. In 1293, he [[Alauddin Khalji's raid on Bhilsa|raided Bhilsa]], a wealthy town in the [[Paramara]] kingdom of [[Malwa]], which had been weakened by multiple invasions.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=321}} At Bhilsa, he came to know about the immense wealth of the southern [[Yadavas of Devagiri|Yadava kingdom]] in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region, as well as about the routes leading to their capital [[Devagiri]]. Therefore, he shrewdly surrendered the loot from Bhilsa to Jalaluddin to win the Sultan's confidence, while withholding the information on the Yadava kingdom.{{sfn|A. B. M. Habibullah|1992|p=322}} A pleased Jalaluddin gave him the office of ''Ariz-i Mamalik'' (Minister of War), and also made him the governor of [[Awadh]].{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=45}} In addition, the Sultan granted Alauddin's request to use the revenue surplus for hiring additional troops.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=322}}\n\nAfter years of planning and preparation, Alauddin successfully [[Alauddin Khalji's raid on Devagiri|raided Devagiri]] in 1296. He left Devagiri with a huge amount of wealth, including precious metals, jewels, silk products, elephants, horses, and slaves.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=322\u2013323}} When the news of Alauddin's success reached Jalaluddin, the Sultan came to [[Gwalior]], hoping that Alauddin would present the loot to him there. However, Alauddin marched directly to Kara with all the wealth. Jalaluddin's advisors such as Ahmad Chap recommended intercepting Alauddin at Chanderi, but Jalaluddin had faith in his nephew. He returned to Delhi, believing that Alauddin would carry the wealth from Kara to Delhi. After reaching Kara, Alauddin sent a letter of apology to the Sultan, and expressed concern that his enemies may have poisoned the Sultan's mind against him during his absence. He requested a letter of pardon signed by the Sultan, which the Sultan immediately despatched through messengers. At Kara, Jalaluddin's messengers learned of Alauddin's military strength and of his plans to dethrone the Sultan. However, Alauddin detained them, and prevented them from communicating with the Sultan.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=323}}\n\nMeanwhile, Alauddin's younger brother Almas Beg (later Ulugh Khan), who was married to a daughter of Jalaluddin, assured the Sultan of Alauddin's loyalty. He convinced Jalaluddin to visit Kara and meet Alauddin, saying that Alauddin would commit suicide out of guilt if the Sultan didn't pardon him personally. A gullible Jalaluddin set out for Kara with his army. After reaching close to Kara, he directed Ahmad Chap to take his main army to Kara by the land route, while he himself decided to cross the [[Ganges river]] with a smaller body of around 1,000 soldiers. On 20 July 1296, Alauddin had Jalaluddin killed after pretending to greet the Sultan, and declared himself the new king. Jalaluddin's companions were also killed, while Ahmad Chap's army retreated to Delhi.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=324}}\n\n== Ascension and march to Delhi ==\n[[File:Delhi Sultanate under Jalaluddin Khalji - based on A Historical Atlas of South Asia.svg|thumb|280px|Extent of the Delhi Sultanate at the time of Jalaluddin Khalji's ascension (1290)]]\nAlauddin, known as Ali Gurshasp until his ascension in July 1296, was formally proclaimed as the new king with the title ''Alauddunya wad Din Muhammad Shah-us Sultan'' at [[Kara, Uttar Pradesh|Kara]]. Meanwhile, the head of Jalaluddin was paraded on a spear in his camp before being sent to [[Awadh]].{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=326}} Over the next two days, Alauddin formed a provisional government at Kara. He promoted the existing ''[[Emir|Amirs]]'' to the rank of ''[[Malik]]s'', and appointed his close friends as the new ''Amirs''.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=327}}\n\nAt that time, there were heavy rains, and the [[Ganga]] and the [[Yamuna]] rivers were flooded. But Alauddin made preparations for a march to Delhi, and ordered his officers to recruit as many soldiers as possible, without fitness tests or [[background check]]s.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=327}} His objective was to cause a change in the general political opinion, by portraying himself as someone with huge public support.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=328}} To portray himself as a generous king, he ordered 5 [[mann (unit)#Persia|manns]] of gold pieces to be shot from a ''manjaniq'' ([[catapult]]) at a crowd in Kara.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=327}}\n\nOne section of his army, led by himself and [[Nusrat Khan Jalesari|Nusrat Khan]], marched to Delhi via [[Badaun]] and Baran (modern [[Bulandshahr]]). The other section, led by [[Zafar Khan (Indian general)|Zafar Khan]], marched to Delhi via [[Kol Tehsil|Koil]] (modern [[Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh|Aligarh]]).{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=327}} As Alauddin marched to Delhi, the news spread in towns and villages that he was recruiting soldiers while distributing gold. Many people, from both military and non-military backgrounds, joined him. By the time he reached Badaun, he had a 56,000-strong cavalry and a 60,000-strong infantry.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=327}} At Baran, Alauddin was joined by seven powerful Jalaluddin's nobles who had earlier opposed him. These nobles were Tajul Mulk Kuchi, Malik Abaji Akhur-bek, Malik Amir Ali Diwana, Malik Usman Amir-akhur, Malik Amir Khan, Malik Umar Surkha and Malik Hiranmar. Alauddin gave each of them 30 to 50 ''mann''s of gold, and each of their soldiers 300 silver ''tanka''s (hammered coins).{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=328}}\n\nAlauddin's march to Delhi was interrupted by the flooding of the Yamuna river. Meanwhile, in Delhi, Jalaluddin's widow ''Malka-i-Jahan'' appointed her youngest son Qadr Khan as the new king with the title Ruknuddin Ibrahim, without consulting the nobles. This irked Arkali Khan, her elder son and the governor of [[Multan]]. When ''Malika-i-Jahan'' heard that Jalaluddin's nobles had joined Alauddin, she apologized to Arkali and offered him the throne, requesting him to march from Multan to Delhi. However, Arkali refused to come to her aid.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=328}}\n\nAlauddin resumed his march to Delhi in the second week of October 1296, when the Yamuna river subsided. When he reached [[Siri Fort|Siri]], Ruknuddin led an army against him. However, a section of Ruknuddin's army defected to Alauddin at midnight.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=328}} A dejected Ruknuddin then retreated and escaped to Multan with his mother and the loyal nobles. Alauddin then entered the city, where a number of nobles and officials accepted his authority. On 21 October 1296, Alauddin was formally proclaimed as the Sultan in Delhi.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=329}}\n\n== Consolidation of power ==\n\nInitially, Alauddin consolidated power by making generous grants and endowments, and appointing many people to government positions.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=330}} He balanced the power between the officers appointed by the [[Mamluk Dynasty (Delhi)|Mamluks]], the ones appointed by Jalaluddin, and his own appointees.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=329}} He also increased the strength of the Sultanate's army, and gifted every soldier the salary of a year and a half in cash. Of Alauddin's first year as the Sultan, chronicler [[Ziauddin Barani]] wrote that it was the happiest year that the people of Delhi had ever seen.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=330}}\n\nAt this time, Alauddin's could not exercise his authority over all of Jalaluddin's former territories. In the [[Punjab region]], his authority was limited to the areas east of the [[Ravi river]]. The region beyond [[Lahore]] suffered from [[Mongol invasions of India|Mongol raids]] and [[Khokhar]] rebellions.

He viewed their haughtiness and their direct and indirect resistance as the main difficulty affecting his reign. He also had to face talk of conspiracies at his court.{{sfn|Hermann Kulke|Dietmar Rothermund|2004|p=171-173}}\n\nAfter some initial conspiracies and Hindu revolts in rural areas during the early period of his reign, he struck the root of the problem by introducing reforms that also aimed at ensuring support of his army and food supply to his capital. He took away all landed properties of his courtiers and nobels and cancelled revenue assignments which were henceforth controlled by the central authorities. Henceforth, \"everybody was busy earning with earning a living so that nobody could even think of rebellion\". He also ordered \"to supply some rules and regulations for grinding down the Hindus, and for depriving them of that wealth and property which fosters rebellion.

His government recruited many accountants, collectors and agents. These officials were well-paid but were subject to severe punishment if found to be taking bribes. Account books were audited and even small discrepancies were punished. The effect was both large landowners and small-scale cultivators were fearful of missing out on paying their assessed taxes.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2004|p=80}}\n\nAlauddin's government imposed the ''[[jizya]]'' tax on its non-Muslim subjects, and his Muslim subjects were obligated to contribute ''[[zakat]]''.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=250}} He also levied taxes on residences (''ghari'') and [[grazing]] (''chara'i''), which were not sanctioned by the Islamic law.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=243}} In addition, Alauddin demanded four-fifth share of the spoils of war from his soldiers, instead of the traditional one-fifth share (''[[khums]]'').{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=250}}\n\n=== Market reforms ===\n\n{{main|Market reforms of Alauddin Khalji}}\n\nAlauddin implemented [[price control]] measures for a wide variety of market goods.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2007|p=105}} Alauddin's courtier [[Amir Khusrau]] and the 14th century writer Hamid Qalandar suggest that Alauddin introduced these changes for public welfare.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=374\u2013376}} However, Barani states that Alauddin wanted to reduce the prices so that low salaries were acceptable to his soldiers, and thus, to maintain a large army.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2014|p=103}}{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=166}} In addition, Barani suggests that the Hindu traders indulged in [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]], and Alauddin's market reforms resulted from the Sultan's desire to punish the Hindus.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2007|p=104}}\n\nTo ensure that the goods were sold at regulated prices, Alauddin appointed market supervisors and spies, and received independent reports from them. To prevent a [[black market]], his administration prohibited peasants and traders from storing the grains, and established government-run granaries, where government's share of the grain was stored. The government also forced the transport workers to re-settle in villages at specific distances along the Yamuna river to enable rapid transport of grain to Delhi.{{sfn|Hermann Kulke|Dietmar Rothermund|2004|p=173}}\n\nChroniclers such as Khusrau and Barani state that the prices were not allowed to increase during Alauddin's lifetime, even when the rainfall was scarce.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=379}} The shopkeepers who violated the price control regulations or tried to circumvent them (such as, by using false weights) were given severe punishments.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=387}}\n\n=== Military reforms ===\n\nAlauddin maintained a large [[standing army]], which included 475,000 horseman according to the 16th-century chronicler [[Firishta]].{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=257}} He managed to raise such a large army by paying relatively low salaries to his soldiers, and introduced [[market reforms of Alauddin Khalji|market price controls]] to ensure that the low salaries were acceptable to his soldiers.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=166}} Although he was opposed to granting lands to his generals and soldiers, he generously rewarded them after successful campaigns, especially those in [[Deccan]].{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=260}}\n\nAlauddin's government maintained a descriptive roll of every soldier, and occasionally conducted strict reviews of the army to examine the horses and arms of the soldiers.

As part of his measures to prevent rebellions, Alauddin imposed [[prohibition]], because he believed that the rampant use of alcoholic drinks enabled people to assemble, lose their senses and think of rebellion. According to [[Isami (historian)|Isami]], Alauddin banned alcohol, after a noble condemned him for merrymaking when his subjects were suffering from a famine. However, this account appears to be hearsay.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=261}}\n\nSubsequently, Alauddin also banned other intoxicants, including [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=261}} He also banned [[gambling]], and excommunicated drunkards and gamblers from Delhi, along with vendors of intoxicants.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=262}} Alauddin's administration strictly punished the violators, and ensured non-availability of alcohol not only in Delhi, but also in its surrounding areas. Nevertheless, alcohol continued to be illegally produced in and smuggled into Delhi.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|pp=262\u2013263}} Sometime later, Alauddin relented, and allowed distillation and drinking in private. However, public distribution and drinking of wine remained prohibited.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=263}}\n\nAlauddin also increased his level of control over the nobility. To prevent rebellions by the nobles, he confiscated their wealth and removed them from their bases of power. Even charitable lands administered by nobles were confiscated. Severe punishments were given for disloyalty. Even wives and children of soldiers rebelling for greater war spoils were imprisoned. An efficient spy network was set up that reached into the private households of nobles.

He also convinced Alauddin to order the killing of his brother-in-law Alp Khan, an influential noble who could rival Malik Kafur's power.

Gradually, it became filled with mud, and was [[silt|desilted]] by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]] around 1354.

The fort walls were mainly constructed using [[rubble]] (in mud), although there are some traces of [[ashlar]] [[masonry]] (in [[lime (material)|lime]] and [[lime plaster]]).{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=375}} Alauddin camped in Siri during the [[Mongol invasion of India, 1303|1303 Mongol invasion]], and after the Mongols left, he built the Qasr-i-Hazar Situn palace at the site of his camp. The fortified city of Siri existed in the time of Timur, whose memoirs state that it had seven gates.

His administration persecuted the [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] ([[Shia]]) minorities, after the orthodox Sunnis falsely accused them of permitting incest in their \"secret assemblies\". Alauddin ordered an inquiry against them sometime before 1311. The inquiry was conducted by the orthodox ''[[ulama]]'', who found several Ismailis guilty. Alauddin ordered the convicts to be [[saw]]n into two.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=399}}\n\n[[Ziauddin Barani]], writing half-a-century after his death, mentions that Alauddin did not patronize the Muslim ''ulama'', and that \"his faith in [[Islam]] was firm like the faith of the illiterate and the ignorant\". He further states that Alauddin once thought of establishing a new religion. Just like the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]'s four [[Rashidun]] [[caliph]]s helped spread Islam, Alauddin believed that he too had four [[Khan (title)|Khans]] ([[Ulugh Khan|Ulugh]], [[Nusrat Khan Jalesari|Nusrat]], [[Zafar Khan (Indian general)|Zafar]] and [[Alp Khan|Alp]]), with whose help he could establish a new religion.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=336\u2013337}} Barani's uncle Alaul Mulk convinced him to drop this idea, stating that a new religion could only be found based on a revelation from god, not based on human wisdom.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=90}} Alaul Mulk also argued that even great conquerors like [[Genghis Khan]] had not been able to subvert Islam, and people would revolt against Alauddin for founding a new religion.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=91}} Barani's claim that Alauddin thought of founding a religion has been repeated by several later chroniclers as well as later historians. Historian [[Banarsi Prasad Saksena]] doubts the authenticity of this claim, arguing that it is not supported by Alauddin's contemporary writers.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=336\u2013337}}\n\nAccording to Barani, Alauddin was the first sultan to separate religion from the state. Barani wrote that he:<ref name=Mehta/>\n\n{{blockquote|came to the conclusion that polity and government are one thing, and the rules and decrees of law are another.

These temples included the ones at [[Bhilsa]] (1292), [[Devagiri]] (1295), [[Vijapur]] (1298\u20131310), [[Somnath]] (1299), [[Jhain]] (1301), [[Chidambaram]] (1311) and [[Madurai]] (1311).{{sfn|Richard M.

In a 1305 document, Khusrau mentions that Alauddin treated the obedient Hindu [[zamindar]]s (feudal landlords) kindly, and granted more favours to them than they had expected. In his poetic style, Khusrau states that by this time, all the insolent Hindus in the realm of [[Hindustan|Hind]] had died on the battlefield, and the other Hindus had bowed their heads before Alauddin. Describing a court held on 19 October 1312, Khusrau writes the ground had become [[saffron (color)|saffron]]-coloured from the [[tilaka|tilaks]] of the Hindu chiefs bowing before Alauddin.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=354}} This policy of compromise with Hindus was greatly criticized by a small but vocal set of Muslim extremists, as apparent from Barani's writings.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=355\u2013356}}\n\nAlauddin rarely listened to the advice of the orthodox ulama. When he had asked about the position of Hindus under an Islamic state, the ''qazi'' Mughis replied that the Hindu \"should pay the taxes with meekness and humility coupled with the utmost respect and free from all reluctance. Should the collector choose to spit in his mouth, he should open the same without hesitation, so that the official may spit into it... The purport of this extreme meekness and humility on his part... is to show the extreme submissiveness incumbent upon this race. God Almighty Himself (in the Quran) commands their complete degradation in as much as these Hindus are the deadliest foes of the true prophet.
