He also wrote the comic strips ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'' (in the years 1937\u201345) and ''[[Long Sam]]'' (1954). He won the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben Award]] in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year, and their 1979 [[E. C. Segar|Elzie Segar Award]], posthumously for his \"unique and outstanding contribution to the profession of cartooning\". Comic strips dealt with northern urban experiences until the year Capp introduced \"Li'l Abner\", the first strip based in the South. Although Capp was from Connecticut, he spent 43 years teaching the world about Dogpatch, reaching an estimated 60 million readers in more than 900 American newspapers and 100 foreign papers in 28 countries. [[M. Thomas Inge]] says Capp made a large personal fortune through the strip and \"had a profound influence on the way the world viewed the American South\".<ref>M.

Capp's parents were both natives of [[Latvia]] whose families had migrated to New Haven in the 1880s. \"My mother and father had been brought to this country from Russia when they were infants\", wrote Capp in 1978. \"Their fathers had found that the great promise of America was true&nbsp;\u2014 it was no crime to be a Jew.\" The Caplins were dirt-poor, and Capp later recalled stories of his mother going out in the night to sift through ash barrels for reusable bits of coal.\n\nIn August 1919, at the age of nine, Capp was run down by a [[Tram|trolley car]] and had to have his left leg amputated, well above the knee.<ref>See [http://lil-abner.com/al-capp/ Li'l Abner Official Site: Al Capp biography]</ref> According to his father Otto's unpublished autobiography, young Capp was not prepared for the amputation beforehand; having been in a coma for days, he suddenly awoke to discover that his leg was removed.<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) p. 4</ref> He was eventually given a prosthetic leg, but only learned to use it by adopting a slow way of walking which became increasingly painful as he grew older.<ref>See [http://www.tcj.com/reviews/al-capp-a-life-to-the-contrary/ Review: \"Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary,\" by R.C. Harvey, published March 14, 2013]</ref> The childhood tragedy of losing a leg likely helped shape Capp's cynical worldview, which was darker and more sardonic than that of the average newspaper cartoonist.<ref>see [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811832,00.html \"Inhuman Man,\" ''Time'', February 6, 1950]</ref> \"I was indignant as hell about that leg\", he would reveal in a November 1950 interview in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.\n\n\"The secret of how to live without resentment or embarrassment in a world in which I was different from everyone else\", Capp philosophically wrote (in ''[[Life magazine]]'' on May 23, 1960), \"was to be indifferent to that difference.\"<ref>see [https://books.google.com/books?id=3k4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA129&dq=Al+Capp&as_pt=MAGAZINES#v=onepage&q=Al%20Capp&f=false ''Life'', 23 May 1960, pp. 129\u2013140]</ref> The prevailing opinion among his friends was that Capp's [[Jonathan Swift|Swiftian]] satire was, to some degree, a creatively channeled, compensatory response to his disability.\n[[File:Al Capp Self-portrait April 1951.JPG|right|450px|thumb|\"I do ''Li'l Abner!!'',\" a self-portrait by Al Capp, excerpted from the<br />April 16\u201317, 1951 ''Li'l Abner'' strips; note the reference to [[Milton Caniff]]]]\nCapp's father, a failed businessman and an amateur cartoonist, introduced him to drawing as a form of therapy. He became quite proficient, advancing mostly on his own. Among his earliest influences were ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoonist\u2013illustrator [[Phil May (caricaturist)|Phil May]], and American comic strip cartoonists [[Thomas Aloysius Dorgan|Tad Dorgan]], [[Cliff Sterrett]], [[Rube Goldberg]], [[Rudolph Dirks]], [[Frederick Burr Opper|Fred Opper]], [[Billy DeBeck]], [[George McManus]], and [[Milt Gross]]. At about this same time, Capp became a voracious reader. According to Capp's brother Elliot, Alfred had finished all of Shakespeare and [[George Bernard Shaw]] by the time he turned 13. Among his childhood favorites were [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Booth Tarkington]], and later, [[Robert Benchley]] and [[S. J. Perelman]].\n\nCapp spent five years at Bridgeport High School in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], without receiving a diploma. He liked to joke about how he failed geometry for nine straight terms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bridgeport.ct.schoolwebpages.com/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=5111 |title=Web page at Bridgeport Central High School devoted to Al Capp |access-date=2006-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185724/http://bridgeport.ct.schoolwebpages.com/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=5111 |archive-date=2007-09-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His formal training came from a series of art schools in the [[New England]] area. Attending three of them in rapid succession, the impoverished Capp was thrown out of each for nonpayment of tuition&mdash;the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum School of Fine Arts]], the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], and Designers Art School in Boston&mdash;the last before launching his career. Capp already had decided to become a cartoonist. \"I heard that [[Bud Fisher]] (creator of ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'') got $3,000 a week and was constantly marrying French countesses\", Capp said. \"I decided that was for me.\"\n\nIn early 1932, Capp hitchhiked to [[New York City]]. He lived in \"airless rat holes\" in [[Greenwich Village]] and turned out advertising strips at $2-apiece while scouring the city hunting for jobs. He eventually found work at the [[Associated Press]] when he was 23 years old. By March 1932, Capp was drawing ''Colonel Gilfeather'', a single-panel, AP-owned property created in 1930 by [[Richard Dorgan|Dick Dorgan]]. Capp changed the focus and title to ''Mister Gilfeather'', but soon grew to hate the feature. He left the Associated Press in September 1932. Before leaving, he met [[Milton Caniff]] and the two became lifelong friends. Capp moved to [[Boston]] and married Catherine Wingate Cameron, whom he had met earlier in art class. She died in 2006 at the age of 96.\n\nLeaving his new wife with her parents in [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]], he subsequently returned to New York in 1933, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]]. \"I was 23, I carried a mass of drawings, and I had nearly five dollars in my pocket. People were sleeping in alleys then, willing to work at anything.\" There he met [[Ham Fisher]], who hired him to ghost on ''[[Joe Palooka]]''. During one of Fisher's extended vacations, Capp's ''Joe Palooka'' [[story arc]] introduced a stupid, coarse, oafish mountaineer named \"Big Leviticus,\" a crude [[prototype]]. (Leviticus was much closer to Capp's later villains Lem and Luke Scragg, than to the much more appealing and innocent Li'l Abner.)\n\nAlso during this period, Capp was working at night on samples for the strip that would eventually become ''[[Li'l Abner]]''. He based his cast of characters on the authentic mountain-dwellers he met while hitchhiking through rural [[West Virginia]] and the [[Cumberland Valley]] as a teenager. (This was years before the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Act brought basic utilities such as electricity and running water to the region.) Leaving ''Joe Palooka'', Capp sold ''Li'l Abner'' to [[United Feature Syndicate]] (later known as [[United Media]]). The feature was launched on Monday, August 13, 1934, in eight North American newspapers&mdash;including the ''[[New York Mirror]]''&mdash;and was an immediate success. Alfred G. Caplin eventually became \"Al Capp\" because the syndicate felt the original would not fit in a cartoon frame.<ref>A review of the 1934 strips reveals that the earliest strips were signed \"Al G. Cap\", which became \"Al G. Capp\" and, finally, \"Al Capp\". However, the middle initial (\"Al G. Capp\") appeared from time to time during the first year.</ref> Capp had his name changed legally in 1949.\n\nHis younger brother [[Elliot Caplin]] also became a comic strip writer, best known for co-creating the [[soap opera]] strip ''[[The Heart of Juliet Jones]]'' with artist [[Stan Drake]] and conceiving the comic strip character ''[[Broom-Hilda]]'' with cartoonist [[Russell Myers]]. Elliot also authored several off-Broadway plays, including ''A Nickel for Picasso'' (1981), which was based on and dedicated to his mother and his famous brother.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/nyregion/theater-a-new-play-explores-fantasies-of-a-man-at-60.html ''New York Times'' theater column by Alvin Klein, November 8, 1987]</ref>\n\n==''Li'l Abner''==\n{{Main|Li'l Abner}}\nWhat began as a [[hillbilly]] [[burlesque]] soon evolved into one of the most imaginative, popular, and well-drawn strips of the twentieth century. Featuring vividly outlandish characters, bizarre situations, and equal parts [[suspense]], [[slapstick]], [[irony]], [[satire]], [[black humor]], and biting [[social commentary]], ''Li'l Abner'' is considered a classic of the genre. The comic strip stars Li'l Abner Yokum\u2014the simple-minded, loutish but good-natured, and eternally innocent hayseed who lives with his parents\u2014scrawny but superhuman Mammy Yokum, and shiftless, childlike Pappy Yokum.\n\n\"Yokum\" was a combination of ''yokel'' and ''hokum'', although Capp established a deeper meaning for the name during a series of visits around 1965\u20131970 with comics historians George E. Turner and Michael H. Price. \"It's phonetic [[Hebrew]]\u2014that's what it is, all right\u2014and that's what I was getting at with the name Yokum, more so than any attempt to sound ''hickish''\", said Capp. \"That was a fortunate coincidence, of course, that the name should pack a backwoods connotation. But it's a godly conceit, really, playing off a godly name\u2014''[[Joachim]]'' means 'God's determination', something like that\u2014that also happens to have a rustic ring to it.\"<ref>[http://www.comicmix.com/news/2007/11/11/li-l-abner-lost-in-hollywood-shuffle-by-michael-h-price/ \"Li'l Abner Lost In Hollywood\" by Michael H. Price]</ref>\n\nThe Yokums live in the backwater hamlet of [[Dogpatch]], [[Kentucky]]. Described by its creator as \"an average stone-age community\", Dogpatch mostly consists of hopelessly ramshackle log cabins, pine trees, \"tarnip\" fields, and \"hawg\" wallows. Whatever energy Abner had went into evading the marital goals of Daisy Mae Scragg, his sexy, well-endowed (but virtuous) girlfriend\u2014until Capp finally gave in to reader pressure and allowed the couple to marry. This newsworthy event made the cover of ''Life'' on March 31, 1952.\n\nCapp peopled his comic strip with an assortment of memorable characters, including Marryin' Sam, Hairless Joe, Lonesome Polecat, Evil-Eye Fleegle, General Bullmoose, Lena the Hyena, Senator Jack S. Phogbound (Capp's caricature of the anti-[[New Deal]] [[Dixiecrats]]), the ''(shudder!)'' Scraggs, Available Jones, Nightmare Alice, Earthquake McGoon, and a host of others. Most notably, certainly from a [[GI (military)|G.I.]] point of view, are the beautiful, full-figured women such as Daisy Mae, Wolf Gal, Stupefyin' Jones, and Moonbeam McSwine (a caricature of his wife Catherine, aside from the dirt)\u2014all of whom found their way onto the [[nose art|painted noses]] of [[bomber aircraft|bomber planes]] during World War II and the Korean War. Perhaps Capp's most popular creations were the [[Shmoo]]s, creatures whose incredible usefulness and generous nature made them a threat to civilization as we know it. Another famous character was [[Joe Btfsplk]], who wants to be a loving friend, but is \"the world's worst jinx\", bringing bad luck to all those nearby. Btfsplk (his name is \"pronounced\" by simply blowing a \"raspberry\" or [[Bronx cheer (gesture)|Bronx cheer]]) always has an iconic dark cloud over his head.\n\nDogpatch residents regularly combat the likes of city slickers, business tycoons, government officials, and intellectuals with their homespun simplicity. Situations often take the characters to other destinations, including New York City, Washington, D.C., Hollywood, tropical islands, the Moon, Mars, and some purely fanciful worlds of Capp's invention. The last includes El Passionato, Kigmyland, The Republic of Crumbumbo, Skunk Hollow, The Valley of the Shmoon, Planets Pincus Number 2 and 7, and a miserable frozen wasteland known as [[Lower Slobbovia]], a pointedly political satire of backward nations and foreign diplomacy that remains a contemporary reference.<ref>{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Russell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/13/opinion/observer-hillary-in-lower-slobbovia.html |title=Hillary in Lower Slobbovia - '&#39;NY Times'&#39; Jan. 13, 1996 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1996-01-13 |access-date=2009-08-29}}</ref> \"Indeed, ''Li'l Abner'' incorporates such a panoply of characters and ideas that it defies summary\", according to cultural historian Anthony Harkins. \"Yet though Capp's storylines often wandered far afield, his hillbilly setting remained a central touchstone, serving both as a microcosm and a distorting carnival mirror of broader American society.\"<ref>''Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon'' by Anthony Harkins (2004, Oxford Univ. Press) pp. 124\u2013136</ref>\n\nThe strip's popularity grew from an original eight papers, to ultimately more than 900. At its peak, ''Li'l Abner'' was estimated to have been read daily in the United States by 60 to 70 million people (the U.S. population at the time was only 180 million), with adult readers far outnumbering children. Many communities, high schools and colleges staged [[Sadie Hawkins dance]]s, patterned after the similar annual event in the strip.\n\nLi'l Abner has one odd design quirk that has puzzled readers for decades: the part in his hair always faces the viewer, no matter which direction Abner is facing. In response to the question \"Which side does Abner part his hair on?\", Capp would answer, \"Both.\" Capp said he finally found the right \"look\" for Li'l Abner with [[Henry Fonda]]'s character Dave Tolliver, in ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936 film)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'' (1936).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=U99JAAAAMAAJ&q=fonda+%22li%27l+abner%22&dq=fonda+%22li%27l+abner%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=0 Steen, Mike ''Hollywood Speaks: An Oral History'' Putnam, 1974]</ref> In later years, Capp always claimed to have effectively created the [[miniskirt]], when he first put one on Daisy Mae in 1934.\n\n==Parodies, toppers, and alternate strips==\n''Li'l Abner'' also features a comic strip-within-the-strip: ''[[Fearless Fosdick]]'' is a parody of [[Chester Gould]]'s ''[[Dick Tracy]]''. It first appeared in 1942, and proved so popular that it ran intermittently during the next 35 years. Gould was parodied personally in the series as cartoonist \"Lester Gooch\"\u2014the diminutive, much-harassed and occasionally deranged \"creator\" of Fosdick. The style of the ''Fosdick'' sequences closely mimicks ''Tracy'', including the urban setting, the outrageous villains, the galloping [[mortality rate]], the crosshatched shadows, and even the lettering style. In 1952, Fosdick was the star of his own short-lived [[puppet show]] on [[NBC]], featuring the Mary Chase [[marionette]]s.\n\nBesides ''Dick Tracy'', Capp parodied many other comic strips in ''Li'l Abner''\u2014including ''[[Steve Canyon]]'', ''[[Superman (comic strip)|Superman]]'' (at least twice; first as \"Jack Jawbreaker\" in 1947, and again in 1966 as \"Chickensouperman\"), ''[[Mary Worth]]'' as \"Mary Worm\", ''[[Peanuts]]'' {with \"Peewee\" a parody of Charlie Brown with \"Croopy\" parody of [[Snoopy]]\" {1968} drawn by Bedley Damp a parody of [[Charles Schulz]]}, ''[[Rex Morgan, M.D.]]'', ''[[Little Annie Rooney]]'', and ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' (in which Punjab became \"Punjbag,\" an oleaginous slob). ''Fearless Fosdick''\u2014and Capp's other spoofs such as \"Little Fanny Gooney\" (1952) and \"Jack Jawbreaker\"\u2014were almost certainly an early inspiration for [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s ''[[Mad Magazine]]'', which began in 1952 as a [[comic book]] that specifically parodied other comics in the same distinctive style and subversive manner.\n\nCapp also lampooned popular recording idols of the day, such as [[Elvis Presley]] (\"Hawg McCall\", 1957), [[Liberace]] (\"Loverboynik\", 1956), [[the Beatles]] (\"the Beasties\", 1964)\u2014and in 1944, [[Frank Sinatra]]. \"Sinatra was the first great public figure I ever wrote about,\" Capp once said. \"I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' I remember my news syndicate was so worried about what his reaction might be, and we were all surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always made it a point to send me a spent condom whenever he happened to see me in a restaurant{{nbsp}}...\" (from ''Frank Sinatra, My Father'' by [[Nancy Sinatra]], 1985). On the other hand, Liberace was \"cut to the quick\" over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal action\u2014as would [[Joan Baez]] later, over \"Joanie Phoanie\" in 1967.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/topic/Al_Capp/ UPI Photo/Files Al Capp Jan. 11, 1967]</ref>\n\nCapp was just as likely to parody himself; his self-caricature made frequent, tongue-in-cheek appearances in ''Li'l Abner''.<ref>''Anything Can Happen in a Comic Strip: Centennial Reflections on an American Art Form'' by [[M. Thomas Inge]] (1995) University Press of Mississippi, pp. 18\u201319</ref> The gag was often at his own expense, as in the above 1951 sequence showing Capp's interaction with \"fans\" (see excerpt), or in his 1955 [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] parody, \"Hal Yappland\". Just about anything could be a target for Capp's satire\u2014in one storyline Li'l Abner is revealed to be the [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]] between ape and man. In another, the search is on in Dogpatch for a pair of missing socks knitted by the first president of the United States.\n \nIn addition to creating ''Li'l Abner'', Capp also co-created two other newspaper strips: ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'' with magazine illustrator [[Raeburn van Buren]] in 1937, and ''[[Long Sam]]'' with cartoonist [[Bob Lubbers]] in 1954, as well as the Sunday \"[[topper (comic strip)|topper]]\" strips ''Washable Jones'', ''Small Fry'' (a.k.a. ''Small Change''), and ''Advice fo' Chillun''.\n\n==Critical recognition==\nAccording to comics historian [[Coulton Waugh]], a 1947 poll of newspaper readers who claimed they ignored the comics page altogether revealed that many confessed to making a single exception: ''Li'l Abner''. \"When ''Li'l Abner'' made its debut in 1934, the vast majority of comic strips were designed chiefly to amuse or thrill their readers. Capp turned that world upside-down by routinely injecting politics and social commentary into ''Li'l Abner''. The strip was the first to regularly introduce characters and story lines having nothing to do with the nominal stars of the strip. The technique\u2014as invigorating as it was unorthodox\u2014was later adopted by cartoonists such as [[Walt Kelly]] [''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''] and [[Garry Trudeau]] [''[[Doonesbury]]'']\", wrote comic strip historian [[Rick Marschall]]. According to Marschall, ''Li'l Abner'' gradually evolved into a broad satire of [[human nature]]. In his book ''America's Great Comic Strip Artists'' (1989), Marschall's analysis revealed a decidedly [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] subtext.\n\nOver the years, ''Li'l Abner'' has been adapted to radio, [[Character animation|animated cartoons]], stage production, [[motion pictures]], and television. Capp has been compared, at various times, to Mark Twain, [[Dostoevski]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Lawrence Sterne]], and [[Rabelais]].<ref>Brown, Rodger, \"Dogpatch USA: The Road to Hokum\" article, ''Southern Changes: The Journal of the Southern Regional Council'', Vol. 15, No. 3, 1993, pp. 18-26</ref> Fans of the strip ranged from novelist [[John Steinbeck]], who called Capp \"possibly the best writer in the world today\" in 1953, and even earnestly recommended him for the Nobel Prize in literature\u2014to media critic and theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]], who considered Capp \"the only robust satirical force in American life\". [[John Updike]], comparing Abner to a \"hillbilly [[Candide]]\", added that the strip's \"richness of social and philosophical commentary approached the [[Voltairean]]\".<ref>[http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_2_urb-al-capp.html Exile in Dogpatch: The Curious Neglect of Cartoonist Al Capp, ''City Journal,'' Spring 2010]</ref> [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[William F.

''Li'l Abner: A Study in American Satire'' by [[Arthur Asa Berger]] (Twayne, 1969) contained serious analyses of Capp's narrative technique, his use of dialogue, self-caricature, and grotesquerie, the place of ''Li'l Abner'' in American satire, and the significance of social criticism and the graphic image. \"One of the few strips ever taken seriously by students of American culture,\" wrote Professor Berger, \"''Li'l Abner'' is worth studying ... because of Capp's imagination and artistry, and because of the strip's very obvious social relevance.\" It was reprinted by the [[University Press of Mississippi]] in 1994.\n\n==The 1940s and 1950s==\n[[File:Cappbio46.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Al Capp drew his own autobiography, the 34-page ''Al Capp by Li'l Abner'' (1946), that was distributed to returning World War II amputee veterans.]]\nDuring World War II and for many years afterward, Capp worked tirelessly going to [[hospital]]s to entertain patients, especially to cheer recent amputees and explain to them that the loss of a limb did not mean an end to a happy and productive life. Making no secret of his own disability, Capp openly joked about his [[prosthetic]] leg his whole life. In 1946, Capp created a special full-color comic book, ''Al Capp by Li'l Abner'', to be distributed by the [[Red Cross]] to encourage the thousands of amputee veterans returning from the war. Capp also was involved with the [[Elizabeth Kenny|Sister Kenny Foundation]], which pioneered new treatments for [[polio]] in the 1940s. Serving in his capacity as honorary chairman, Capp made public appearances on its behalf for years, contributed free artwork for its annual fundraising appeals, and entertained crippled and [[paraplegic]] children in children's hospitals with inspirational pep talks, humorous stories, and sketches.<ref>[http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/05/dont-keep-remembering-what-youve-lost.html Letters of Note: Dear Chip... (Columbus Hospital, 28 May 1964)]</ref>\n\nIn 1940, an [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] [[Li'l Abner (1940 film)|movie adaptation]] starred Granville Owen (later known as [[Jeff York]]) as Li'l Abner, with [[Buster Keaton]] taking the role of Lonesome Polecat, and featuring a title song with lyrics by [[Milton Berle]]. A successful musical comedy adaptation of the strip opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the St. James Theater on November 15, 1956, and had a long run of 693 performances, followed by a nationwide tour. The [[Li'l Abner (musical)|stage musical]], with music and lyrics by [[Gene de Paul]] and [[Johnny Mercer]], was adapted into a [[Technicolor]] [[Li'l Abner (1959 film)|motion picture]] at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in 1959 by producer [[Norman Panama]] and director [[Melvin Frank]], with a score by [[Nelson Riddle]]. Several performers repeated their Broadway roles in the film, most memorably [[Julie Newmar]] as Stupefyin' Jones and [[Stubby Kaye]] as Marryin' Sam.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F04E3D9103CE63BBC4A52DFB4678382649EDE The Screen 'Li'l Abner' - New York Times Review]</ref>\n\nOther highlights of that decade included the 1942 debut of Fearless Fosdick as Abner's \"ideel\" (hero); the 1946 Lena the Hyena Contest, in which a hideous Lower Slobbovian gal was ultimately revealed in the harrowing winning entry (as judged by Frank Sinatra, [[Boris Karloff]], and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]) drawn by noted cartoonist [[Basil Wolverton]]; and an ill-fated Sunday parody of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone With the Wind]]'' that aroused anger and legal threats from author [[Margaret Mitchell]], and led to a printed apology within the strip. In October 1947, Li'l Abner met Rockwell P. Squeezeblood, head of the abusive and corrupt Squeezeblood Comic Strip Syndicate. The resulting sequence, \"Jack Jawbreaker Fights Crime!\", was a devastating satire of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s notorious exploitation by [[DC Comics]] over ''[[Superman]]''. It was later reprinted in ''The World of Li'l Abner'' (1953). (Siegel and Shuster had earlier poked fun at Capp in a ''Superman'' story in ''[[Action Comics]] #55'', December 1942, in which a cartoonist named \"Al Hatt\" invents a comic strip featuring the hillbilly \"Tiny Rufe\".)\n\nIn 1947, Capp earned a ''[[Newsweek]]'' cover story. That same year the ''[[New Yorker magazine|New Yorker's]]'' profile on him was so long that it ran in consecutive issues. In 1948, Capp reached a creative peak with the introduction of the [[Shmoo]]s, lovable and innocent fantasy creatures who reproduced at amazing speed and brought so many benefits that, ironically, the world economy was endangered. The much-copied storyline was a [[parable]] that was [[metaphor]]ically interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the [[Cold War]].\n\nFollowing his close friend Milton Caniff's lead (with ''[[Steve Canyon]]''), Capp had recently fought a successful battle with the syndicate to gain complete ownership of his feature when the Shmoos debuted. As a result, he reaped enormous financial rewards from the unexpected (and almost unprecedented) merchandising phenomenon that followed. As in the strip, Shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950\u2014including a ''Time'' cover story. A paperback collection of the original sequence, ''The Life and Times of the Shmoo'', became a bestseller for [[Simon & Schuster]]. Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, [[Halloween]] masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens, and other Shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in [[Baltimore]] turned out a whole line of Shmoo apparel, including \"Shmooveralls\". The original sequence and its 1959 sequel, ''The Return of the Shmoo'', have been collected in print many times since, most recently in 2011, always to high sales figures. The Shmoos would later have their own animated television series.\n\nCapp followed this success with other [[allegory|allegorical]] fantasy critters, including the aboriginal and [[Self-defeating personality disorder|masochistic]] \"Kigmies\", who craved abuse (a story that began as a veiled comment on racial and religious oppression), the dreaded \"Nogoodniks\" (or ''bad'' shmoos), and the irresistible \"Bald Iggle\", a guileless creature whose sad-eyed countenance compelled involuntary truthfulness\u2014with predictably disastrous results.\n\n''Li'l Abner'' was [[censorship|censored]] for the first, but not the last time in September 1947, and was pulled from papers by [[Scripps-Howard]]. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centered on Capp's portrayal of the [[United States Senate]]. Edward Leech of Scripps said, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks&nbsp;... boobs and undesirables.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html Tain't Funny - TIME]</ref> Capp criticized [[Senator Joseph McCarthy]] in 1954, calling him a \"poet\". \"He uses [[poetic license]] to try to create the beautifully ordered world of good guys and bad guys that he wants,\" said Capp. \"He seems at his best when terrifying the helpless and na\u00efve.\"<ref>\"Poet: Cartoonist Al Capp said in New York{{nbsp}}...\" quoted in ''The Argus'', 10 May 1954</ref>\n\nCapp received the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s [[National Cartoonists Society#Billy DeBeck Memorial Award|Billy DeBeck Memorial Award]] in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year. (When the award name was changed in 1954, Capp also retroactively received a [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben]] statuette.) He was an outspoken pioneer in favor of diversifying the NCS by admitting women cartoonists. Originally, the Society had disallowed female members. Capp briefly resigned his membership in 1949 to protest their refusal of admission to [[Hilda Terry]], creator of the comic strip ''[[Teena]]''. According to Tom Roberts, author of ''[[Alex Raymond]]: His Life and Art'' (2007), Capp delivered a stirring speech that was instrumental in changing those rules. The NCS finally accepted female members the following year. In December 1952, Capp published an article in ''Real'' magazine entitled \"The REAL Powers in America\" that further challenged the conventional attitudes of the day: \"The real powers in America are ''women''\u2014the wives and sweethearts behind the masculine dummies&nbsp;...\"\n\nHighlights of the 1950s included the much-heralded marriage of Abner and Daisy Mae in 1952, the birth of their son \"Honest Abe\" Yokum in 1953, and in 1954, the introduction of Abner's enormous, long-lost kid brother Tiny Yokum, who filled Abner's place as a bachelor in the annual Sadie Hawkins Day race. In 1952, Capp and his characters graced the covers of both ''Life'' and ''[[TV Guide]]''. 1956 saw the debut of Bald Iggle, considered by some ''Abner'' enthusiasts to be the creative high point of the strip, as well as Mammy's revelatory encounter with the \"Square Eyes\" Family\u2014Capp's thinly-veiled appeal for racial tolerance. (This [[fable]]-like story was collected into an educational comic book called ''Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!'', and distributed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]] later that year.) Two years later, Capp's studio issued ''[[Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story]]'', a biographical comic book distributed by the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]].<ref name=Grio>Love, David A.

Roaringham Fatback had figured prominently in wiping out the Shmoos. But in 1952, when [[General Motors]] president [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Charles E. Wilson]], nominated for a cabinet post, told [[United States Congress|Congress]] \"...&nbsp;what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa\", he inspired one of Capp's greatest satires\u2014the introduction of General Bullmoose, the robust, ruthless, and ageless business tycoon. The blustering Bullmoose, who seemed to own and control nearly everything, justified his far-reaching and mercenary excesses by saying \"What's good for General Bullmoose is good for ''everybody!''\" Bullmoose's corrupt interests were often pitted against those of the pathetic Lower Slobbovians in a classic mismatch of \"haves\" versus \"have-nots\". This character, along with the Shmoos, helped cement Capp's favor with the [[Left-wing politics|Left]], and would increase their outrage a decade later when Capp, a former [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] liberal, switched targets. Nonetheless, General Bullmoose continued to appear, undaunted and unredeemed, during the strip's final right-wing phase and into the 1970s.\n\n==Feud with Ham Fisher==\nAfter Capp quit his ghosting job on [[Ham Fisher]]'s ''Joe Palooka'' in 1934 to launch his own strip, Fisher badmouthed him to colleagues and editors, claiming that Capp had \"stolen\" his idea. For years, Fisher would bring the characters back to his strip, billing them as \"The ORIGINAL Hillbilly Characters\" and advising readers not to be \"fooled by imitations\". (In fact, Fisher's brutish hillbilly character\u2014Big Leviticus, created by Capp in Fisher's absence\u2014bore little resemblance to Li'l Abner.) According to a November 1950 ''Time'' article, \"Capp parted from Fisher with a definite impression, (to put it mildly) that he had been underpaid and unappreciated. Fisher, a man of Roman self esteem, considered Capp an ingrate and a whippersnapper, and watched his rise to fame with unfeigned horror.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813720-7,00.html Die Monstersinger - TIME]</ref>\n\n\"Fisher repeatedly brought Leviticus and his clan back, claiming their primacy as comics' first hillbilly family&nbsp;\u2014 but he was missing the point. It wasn't the setting that made Capp's strip such a huge success. It was Capp's finely tuned sense of the absurd, his ability to milk an outrageous situation for every laugh in it and then, impossibly, to squeeze even more laughs from it, that found such favor with the public,\" (from [[Don Markstein]]'s ''[[Toonopedia]]'').<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/abner.htm Don Markstein's Toonopedia / Li'l Abner]</ref>\n\nThe Capp-Fisher feud was well known in cartooning circles, and it grew more personal as Capp's strip eclipsed ''Joe Palooka'' in popularity. Fisher hired away Capp's top assistant, [[Moe Leff]]. After Fisher underwent [[plastic surgery]], Capp included a racehorse in ''Li'l Abner'' named \"Ham's Nose-Bob\". In 1950, Capp introduced a cartoonist character named \"Happy Vermin\"\u2014a caricature of Fisher\u2014who hired Abner to draw his comic strip in a dimly lit closet, (after sacking his previous \"temporary\" assistant of 20 years, who had been cut off from all his friends in the process). Instead of using Vermin's tired characters, Abner inventively peopled the strip with hillbillies. A bighearted Vermin told his slaving assistant: \"I'm proud of having created these characters!! They'll make millions for me!! And if they do&nbsp;\u2014 I'll get ''you'' a new light bulb!!\"\n\nTraveling in the same social circles, the two men engaged in a 20-year mutual vendetta, as described by the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' in 1998: \"They crossed paths often, in the midtown watering holes and at National Cartoonists Society banquets, and the city's gossip columns were full of their snarling public donnybrooks.\"<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/09/18/1998-09-18_spitting_on_pictures_funny_p.html Maeder, Jay. \u201cSpitting on Pictures Funny Papers, 1955\u201d, ''Daily News'', September 18, 1998.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008035428/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/09/18/1998-09-18_spitting_on_pictures_funny_p.html |date=October 8, 2009 }}</ref> In 1950, Capp wrote a nasty article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', entitled \"I Remember Monster\". The article recounted Capp's days working for an unnamed \"benefactor\" with a miserly, swinish personality, who Capp claimed was a never-ending source of inspiration when it came time to create a new unregenerate villain for his comic strip. The thinly-veiled boss was understood to be Ham Fisher.\n\nFisher retaliated, doctoring photostats of ''Li'l Abner'' and falsely accusing Capp of sneaking obscenities into his comic strip. Fisher submitted examples of ''Li'l Abner'' to Capp's syndicate and to the New York courts, in which Fisher had identified pornographic images that were hidden in the background art. However, the X-rated material had been drawn there by Fisher. Capp was able to refute the accusation by simply showing the original artwork.\n\nIn 1954, when Capp was applying for a Boston television license, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) received an anonymous packet of pornographic ''Li'l Abner'' drawings. The National Cartoonists Society (NCS) convened an ethics hearing, and Fisher was expelled for the forgery from the same organization that he had helped found; Fisher's scheme had backfired in spectacular fashion. Around the same time, his mansion in Wisconsin was destroyed by a storm. On December 27, 1955, Fisher committed suicide in his studio. The feud and Fisher's suicide were used as the basis for a lurid, highly fictionalized murder mystery, ''Strip for Murder'' by [[Max Allan Collins]].\n\nAnother \"feud\" seemed to be looming when, in one run of Sunday strips in 1957, Capp lampooned the comic strip ''[[Mary Worth]]'' as \"Mary Worm\". The title character was depicted as a nosy, interfering busybody. [[Allen Saunders]], the creator of the ''Mary Worth'' strip, returned Capp's fire with the introduction of the character \"Hal Rapp\", a foul-tempered, ill-mannered, and (ironically) inebriated cartoonist, (Capp was a [[teetotaler]]{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}). Later, the \"feud\" was revealed to be a collaborative hoax that Capp and his longtime pal Saunders had cooked up together. The Capp-Saunders \"feud\" fooled both editors and readers, generated plenty of free publicity for both strips\u2014and Capp and Saunders had a good laugh when all was revealed.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893653,00.html Rap for Capp - TIME]</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nCapp is often associated with two other giants of the medium: [[Milton Caniff]] (''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'', ''Steve Canyon'') and [[Walt Kelly]] (''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]''). The three cartoonists were close personal friends and professional associates throughout their adult lives, and occasionally, referenced each other in their strips. According to one [[anecdote]] (from ''Al Capp Remembered'', 1994), Capp and his brother Elliot ducked out of a dull party at Capp's home\u2014leaving Walt Kelly alone to fend for himself entertaining a group of Argentine envoys who didn't speak English. Kelly retaliated by giving away Capp's [[baby grand piano]]. According to Capp, who loved to relate the story, Kelly's two perfectly logical reasons for doing so were: a. to cement diplomatic relations between [[Argentina]] and the United States, and b. \"Because you can't play the piano, anyway!\" (''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' creator [[Mort Walker]] confirmed the story, relating a slightly expanded version in his autobiography, ''Mort Walker's Private Scrapbook'', 2001.)\n\nMilton Caniff offered another anecdote (from ''Phi Beta Pogo'', 1989) involving Capp and Walt Kelly, \"two boys from [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], nose to nose,\" onstage at a meeting of the Newspaper Comics Council in the sixties. \"Walt would say to Al, 'Of course, Al, this is really how you should draw Daisy Mae, I'm only showing you this for your own good.' Then Walt would do a sketch. Capp, of course, got ticked off by this, as you can imagine! So he retaliated by doing ''his'' version of Pogo. Unfortunately, the drawings are long gone; no recording was made. What a shame! Nobody anticipated there'd be this dueling back and forth between the two of them&nbsp;...\"\n\nAlthough he was often considered a difficult person,<ref name=\"printmag.com\">http://www.printmag.com/interviews/lil-abner-al-capp-monster-cartoonist/</ref> some acquaintances of Capp have stressed that the cartoonist also had a sensitive side. In 1973, when learning that the son of his political rival, [[Ted Kennedy]], had his right leg amputated, Capp wrote the boy a letter of encouragement, giving candid advice as to how to deal with the loss of a limb,<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], p.243</ref> which he had experienced as a boy. One of Capp's grandchildren recalls that at one point, tears were streaming down the cartoonist's cheeks while he was watching a documentary about the [[Jonestown]] massacre.<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], p.244</ref> Also, it is reported that Capp gave money anonymously to charities and \"people in need\" at various points in his life.<ref name=\"printmag.com\"/>\n\n==Sexual misconduct claims==\nIn her autobiography, American actress [[Goldie Hawn]] stated that Capp sexually propositioned her on a [[casting couch]] and exposed himself to her when she was nineteen years old. When she refused his advances, Capp became angry and told her that she was \"never gonna make anything in your life\" and that she should \"go and marry a Jewish dentist. You'll never get anywhere in this business.\"<ref name=couch>[http://people.com/movies/goldie-hawn-remembers-casting-couch-sexual-predator-who-left-her-in-tears-at-19/ Goldie Hawn Remembers the Casting-Couch Sexual Predator Who Left Her in Tears]</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LrI-86BHE0QC&pg=PT113&lpg=PT113&dq=a+lotus+grows+in+the+mud+al+capp#v=onepage&q=a%20lotus%20grows%20in%20the%20mud%20al%20capp&f=false |title=A Lotus Grows in the Mud |last=Hawn |first=Goldie |date=2006-02-28 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9781101205327 |language=en}}</ref>\nTwo biographies, one about Goldie Hawn and the other about [[Grace Kelly]], describe Capp as trying to force Kelly into having sex with him, and he later tried to do the same with Hawn.<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/07/12/cartoonist-al-capp-exposed-in-new-bio/2511355/</ref>\n\nIn 1971, investigative journalist [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] wrote that Capp had exposed his genitals to four female students at the University of Alabama.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/07/12/cartoonist-al-capp-exposed-in-new-bio/2511355/|title=Cartoonist Al Capp exposed in \u2018Life to the Contrary\u2019|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> Then, after an incident at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire, Capp was arrested.

During the extended peak of the strip, the workload grew to include advertising, merchandising, promotional work, public service comics, and other specialty work\u2014in addition to the regular six dailies and one [[Sunday strip]] per week. From the early 1940s to the late 1950s, there were scores of Sunday strip-style magazine ads for [[Cream of Wheat]] using the ''Abner'' characters, and in the 1950s, Fearless Fosdick became a spokesman for Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic in a series of daily strip-style print ads. The characters also sold chainsaws, underwear, ties, detergent, candy, soft drinks\u2014including a licensed version of Capp's moonshine creation, [[Kickapoo Joy Juice]]\u2014and [[General Electric]] and [[Procter & Gamble]] products, all requiring special artwork.\n\nNo matter how much help he had, Capp insisted on his drawing and inking the characters' faces and hands\u2014especially of Abner and Daisy Mae\u2014and his distinctive touch is often discernible. \"He had ''the touch,''\" Frazetta said of Capp in 2008. \"He knew how to take an otherwise ordinary drawing and really make it ''pop''. I'll never knock his talent.\"\n\nAs is usual with collaborative efforts in comic strips, his name was the only one credited\u2014 although, sensitive to his own experience working on ''Joe Palooka'', Capp frequently drew attention to his assistants in interviews and publicity pieces. A 1950 cover story in ''Time'' even included photographs of two of his employees, whose roles in the production were detailed by Capp. Ironically, this highly irregular policy (along with the subsequent fame of Frank Frazetta) has led to the misconception that his strip was \"ghosted\" by other hands. The production of ''Li'l Abner'' has been well documented, however. In point of fact, Capp maintained creative control over every stage of production for virtually the entire run of the strip. Capp originated the stories, wrote the dialogue, designed the major characters, rough penciled the preliminary staging and action of each panel, oversaw the finished pencils, and drew and inked the hands and faces of the characters. Frazetta authority David Winiewicz described the everyday working mode of operation in ''Li'l Abner Dailies: 1954 Volume 20'' (Kitchen Sink, 1994):\n\n{{quote|text=By the time Frazetta began working on the strip, the work of producing ''Li'l Abner'' was too much for one person. Capp had a group of assistants who he taught to reproduce his distinctive individual style, working under his direct supervision. Actual production of the strip began with a rough layout in pencil done by Al Capp, from Capp's script or a co-authored script, and the page would pass to Andy Amato and Walter Johnson. Amato would ink the figures, then Johnson added backgrounds and any mechanical objects. Harvey Curtis was responsible for the lettering and also shared inking duties with Amato&nbsp;... In order to make sure that the work stayed true to his style, the final touches would be added by Capp himself. He enjoyed adding a distinctive glint to an eye or an idiosyncratic contortion to a character's face. The finished strip was truly an ensemble effort, a skillful blending of talents.}}\n\nThere was also a separate line of comic book titles published by the Caplin family-owned [[Toby Press]], including ''Shmoo Comics'' featuring Washable Jones. Cartoonist [[Mell Lazarus]], creator of ''[[Miss Peach]]'' and ''[[Momma]]'', wrote a comic novel in 1963 entitled ''The Boss Is Crazy, Too'' which was partly inspired by his apprenticeship days working with Capp and his brother Elliot at Toby. In a seminar at the [[Charles Schulz Museum]] on November 8, 2008, Lazarus called his experience at Toby \"the five funniest years of my life\". Lazarus went on to cite Capp as one of the \"four essentials\" in the field of newspaper cartoonists, along with Walt Kelly, [[Charles Schulz]], and [[Milton Caniff]].\n\nCapp detailed his approach to writing and drawing the stories in an instructional course book for the [[Famous Artists School]], beginning in 1956. In 1959, Capp recorded and released an album for [[Folkways Records]] (now owned by the [[Smithsonian]]) on which he identified and described \"The Mechanics of the Comic Strip\".<ref>[http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=1284 An Interview with Al Capp - Smithsonian Folkways]</ref>\n\nFrazetta, later famous as a [[fantasy art]]ist, assisted on the strip from 1954 to December, 1961. Fascinated by Frazetta's abilities, Capp initially gave him a free hand in an extended daily sequence (about a biker named \"Frankie,\" a caricature of Frazetta) to experiment with the basic look of the strip by adding a bit more realism and detail (particularly to the inking). After editors complained about the stylistic changes, the strip's previous look was restored. During most of his tenure with Capp, Frazetta's primary responsibility\u2014along with various specialty art, such as a series of ''Li'l Abner'' greeting cards\u2014was tight-penciling the Sunday pages from studio roughs. This work was collected by [[Dark Horse Comics]] in a four-volume hardcover series entitled ''Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Frazetta Years''. In 1961, Capp, complaining of declining revenue, wanted to have Frazetta continue with a 50% pay cut. \"[Capp] said he would cut the salary in half. Goodbye. That was that. ''I'' said goodbye,\" (from ''Frazetta: Painting with Fire''). However, Frazetta returned briefly a few years later to draw a public service comic book called ''Li'l Abner and the Creatures from Drop-Outer Space'', distributed by the [[Job Corps]] in 1965.\n\n==Public service works==\nCapp provided specialty artwork for civic groups, government agencies, and charitable or nonprofit organizations, spanning several decades.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/2012/05/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/\"Presarvin' Freedom: Al Capp, Treasury Man,\" ''Hogan's Alley Online Magazine'', 9 May 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708021015/http://cartoonician.com/2012/05/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/ |date=8 July 2012 }}</ref> The following titles are all single-issue, educational comic books and pamphlets produced for various [[public services]]:\n\n*''Al Capp by Li'l Abner''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] (1946)\n*''Yo' Bets Yo' Life!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Army]] (circa 1950)\n*''Li'l Abner Joins the Navy''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Navy|Dept. of the Navy]] (1950)\n*''Fearless Fosdick and the Case of the Red Feather''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by Red Feather Services, a forerunner of [[United Way of America|United Way]] (1951)\n*''The Youth You Supervise''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (1956)\n*''Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]] (1956)\n*''Operation: Survival!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Civil Defense|Dept. of Civil Defense]] (1957)\n*''Natural Disasters!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the Department of Civil Defense (1957)\n*''[[Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story]]''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by [[The Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (1958)<ref name=Grio />\n*''Li'l Abner and the Creatures from Drop-Outer Space''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Job Corps]] (1965)\n\nIn addition, Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the [[U.S. Treasury]], the Cancer Foundation, the [[March of Dimes]], the National Heart Fund, the Sister Kenny Foundation, the [[Boy Scouts of America]], [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]], the National Reading Council, Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, [[Christmas Seal & Charity Stamp Society|Christmas Seals]], the National Amputation Foundation, and [[Disabled American Veterans]],<ref name=\"news.google.com\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19500511&id=DZZIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4AkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4808,2345975 \"Al Capp Replies to Critic of Newspaper Comic Strips;\" ''The News and Courier'', 11 May 1950]</ref> among others.\n\n==Public figure==\nIn the Golden Age of the American comic strip, successful cartoonists received a great deal of attention; their professional and private lives were reported in the press, and their celebrity was often nearly sufficient to rival their creations. As ''Li'l Abner'' reached its peak years, and following the success of the Shmoos and other high moments in his work, Al Capp achieved a public profile that is still unparalleled in his profession, and arguably exceeded the fame of his strip. \"Capp was the best known, most influential and most controversial cartoonist of his era,\" writes publisher (and leading Shmoo collector) [[Denis Kitchen]]. \"His personal celebrity transcended comics, reaching the public and influencing the culture in a variety of media. For many years he simultaneously produced the daily strip, a weekly syndicated [[newspaper column]], and a 500-station [[radio program]]{{nbsp}}...\" He ran the Boston Summer Theatre with ''[[The Phantom (comics)|The Phantom]]'' cartoonist [[Lee Falk]], bringing in Hollywood actors such as [[Mae West]], [[Melvyn Douglas]], and [[Claude Rains]] to star in their live productions. He even briefly considered running for a Massachusetts Senate seat. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew]] urged Capp to run in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Massachusetts]] primary in 1970 against [[Ted Kennedy]], but Capp ultimately declined. (He did, however, donate his services as a speaker at a $100-a-plate fundraiser for Republican Congressman [[Jack Kemp]].)\n[[File:Al Capp at 1966 Art Festival in Florida.jpg|thumb|Al Capp at 1966 Art Festival in Florida]]\nBesides his use of the comic strip to voice his opinions and display his humor, Capp was a popular guest speaker at universities, and on radio<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779734,00.html The Press: Bane of the Bassinet, ''Time'', 15 March 1948]</ref> and [[television]]. He remains the only cartoonist to be embraced by television; no other comic artist to date has come close to Capp's televised exposure.<ref>[http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reportsitem.aspx?id=102060 Al Capp Views the Networks (April 1952) ''Nieman Reports'']</ref> Capp appeared as a regular on ''[[The Author Meets the Critics]]'' (1948\u2013'54) and made regular, weekly appearances on ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' in 1953. He was also a periodic panelist on ABC and NBC's ''[[Who Said That?]]'' (1948\u2013'55), and co-hosted DuMont's ''[[What's the Story|What's the Story?]]'' (1953). Between 1952 and 1972, he hosted at least ''five'' television shows\u2013three different [[talk show]]s called ''The Al Capp Show'' (1952 and 1968) and ''Al Capp'' (1971\u2013'72), ''Al Capp's America'' (a live \"chalk talk,\" with Capp providing a barbed commentary while sketching cartoons, 1954), and a CBS game show called ''Anyone Can Win'' (1953). He also hosted similar vehicles on the radio\u2014and was a familiar celebrity guest on various other broadcast programs, including the long-running NBC Radio Monitor Beacon as a commentator dubbed \"An expert of nothing with opinions on everything\", ''[[Monitor (NBC radio)|Monitor]]''.\n\nHis frequent appearances on NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' spanned three emcees ([[Steve Allen]], [[Jack Paar]], and [[Johnny Carson]]), from the 1950s to the 1970s. One memorable story, as recounted to Johnny Carson, was about his meeting with then-President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. As Capp was ushered into the [[Oval Office]], his [[Prosthesis|prosthetic leg]] suddenly collapsed into a pile of disengaged parts and hinges on the floor. The President immediately turned to an aide and said, \"Call [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed]] (Hospital), or maybe [[National Naval Medical Center|Bethesda]],\" to which Capp replied, \"Hell no, just call a good local mechanic!\" (Capp also spoofed Carson in his strip, in a 1970 episode called \"The Tommy Wholesome Show\".)\n\nCapp portrayed himself in a cameo role in the [[Bob Hope]] film ''That Certain Feeling'', for which he also provided promotional art. He was interviewed live on ''[[Person to Person]]'' on November 27, 1959, by host [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]]. He also appeared as himself on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', [[Sid Caesar]]'s ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'', ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', and guested on [[Ralph Edwards]]' ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' on February 12, 1961, with honoree Peter Palmer. Capp also freelanced very successfully as a magazine writer and newspaper columnist, in a wide variety of publications including ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'', ''Show'', ''Pageant'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''Coronet'', and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Capp was impersonated by comedians [[Rich Little]] and [[David Frye]]. Although Capp's endorsement activities never rivaled Li'l Abner's or Fearless Fosdick's, he was a celebrity spokesman in print ads for Sheaffer Snorkel fountain pens (along with colleagues and close friends [[Milton Caniff]] and Walt Kelly), and\u2014with an irony that would become apparent later\u2014a brand of cigarettes, ([[Chesterfield cigarettes|Chesterfield]]).\n\nCapp resumed visiting war amputees during the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]]. He toured Vietnam with the [[USO]], entertaining troops along with [[Art Buchwald]] and [[George Plimpton]]. He served as chairman of the Cartoonists' Committee in President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s People-to-People program in 1954 (although Capp had supported [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] for president in 1952 and 1956),<ref>[http://www.reuben.org/ncs/members/memorium/capp.jpg Al Capp's biography card from the National Cartoonists Society]</ref> which was organized to promote [[Savings bond]]s for the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]]. Capp had earlier provided the Shmoo for a special Children's Savings Bond in 1949, accompanying President [[Harry S. Truman]] at the bond's unveiling ceremony.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/\"Presarvin' Freedom: Al Capp, Treasury Man,\" ''Hogan's Alley Online Magazine'', 9 May 2012]</ref> During the [[Soviet Union]]'s blockade of [[West Berlin]] in 1948, the commanders of the Berlin airlift had cabled Capp, requesting inflatable shmoos as part of \"Operation: Little Vittles\". Candy-filled shmoos were air-dropped to hungry West Berliners by America's 17th Military Airport Squadron during the [[humanitarian]] effort. \"When the candy-chocked shmoos were dropped, a near-riot resulted,\" (reported in ''[[Newsweek]]''\u2014October 11, 1948).\n\nIn addition to his public service work for charitable organizations for the handicapped, Capp also served on the National Reading Council, which was organized to combat illiteracy. He published a column (\"Wrong Turn Onto Sesame Street\") challenging federally funded [[public television]] endowments in favor of educational comics\u2014which, according to Capp, \"didn't cost a dime in taxes and never had. I pointed out that a kid could enjoy ''[[Sesame Street]]'' ''without'' learning how to read, but he couldn't enjoy comic strips ''unless'' he could read; and that a smaller investment in getting kids to read by supplying them with educational matter in such ''reading'' form might make better sense.\"\n\nCapp's academic interests included being one of nineteen original \"Trustees and Advisors\" for \"Endicott, Junior College for Young Woman\", located in Pride's Crossing (Beverly), Massachusetts, which was founded in 1939. Al Capp is listed in the 1942 Mingotide Yearbook, representing the first graduating class from Endicott Junior College. The yearbook entry includes his credential as a \"Cartoonist for United Feature Syndicate\" and a resident of New York City.\n\n\"Comics,\" wrote Capp in 1970, \"can be a combination of the highest quality of art and text, and many of them are.\" Capp would produce many giveaway educational comic books and [[public services]] pamphlets, spanning several decades, for the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]], the [[United States civil defense|Department of Civil Defense]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]], the [[U.S. Army]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]] (a forerunner of [[United Way of America|United Way]]), and the [[Job Corps]]. Capp's studio provided special artwork for various civic groups and [[nonprofit organizations]] as well. Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the Cancer Foundation, the [[March of Dimes]], the National Heart Fund, the [[Boy Scouts of America]], Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, the National Amputation Foundation, and [[Disabled American Veterans]], among others.<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/> They were also used to help sell [[Christmas Seals]].\n\nIn the early 1960s, Capp regularly wrote a column entitled ''Al Capp's Column'' for the newspaper ''The Schenectady Gazette'' (currently ''[[The Daily Gazette]]''). He was the ''[[Playboy]]'' interview subject in December 1965, in a conversation conducted by [[Alvin Toffler]]. In August 1967, Capp was the narrator and host of an ABC network special called ''Do Blondes Have More Fun?''. In 1970, he was the subject of a provocative NBC documentary called ''This Is Al Capp''.\n\n==The 1960s and 1970s==\nCapp and his family lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], near [[Harvard]] during the entire Vietnam War protest era. The turmoil that Americans were watching on their television sets was happening live\u2014right in his own neighborhood. Campus [[Far left|radicals]] and \"[[hippies]]\" inevitably became one of Capp's favorite targets in the sixties. Alongside his long-established caricatures of right-wing, big business types such as General Bullmoose and J. Roaringham Fatback, Capp began spoofing [[counterculture]] icons such as [[Joan Baez]] (in the character of Joanie Phoanie, a wealthy folksinger who offers an impoverished orphanage ten thousand dollars' worth of \"protest songs\").<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843312,00.html Which One Is the Phoanie? - Time]</ref> The sequence implicitly labeled Baez a [[limousine liberal]], a charge she took to heart, as detailed years later in her 1987 autobiography, ''And A Voice To Sing With: A Memoir''. Another target was Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], parodied as \"Senator O. Noble McGesture\", resident of \"Hyideelsport\". The town name is a play on [[Hyannisport, Massachusetts]], where a number of the Kennedy clan have lived.\n\nCapp became a popular public speaker on college campuses, where he reportedly relished hecklers. He attacked militant antiwar demonstrators, both in his personal appearances and in his strip. He also satirized student political groups. The [[Youth International Party]] (YIP) and [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) emerged in ''Li'l Abner'' as \"Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything!\" (SWINE). In an April 1969 letter to ''Time'', Capp insisted, \"The students I blast are not the dissenters, but the destroyers\u2014the less than 4% who lock up deans in washrooms, who burn manuscripts of unpublished books, who make combination pigpens and playpens of their universities. The remaining 96% detest them as heartily as I do.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844734-3,00.html Letters page April 18, 1969 - TIME]</ref>\n\nCapp's increasingly controversial remarks at his campus speeches and during television appearances cost him his semi-regular spot on the ''Tonight Show''. His contentious public persona during this period was captured on a late sixties comedy LP called ''Al Capp On Campus''. The album features his interaction with students at Fresno State College (now [[California State University, Fresno]]) on such topics as \"sensitivity training,\" \"humanitarianism,\" \"abstract art\" (Capp hated it), and \"student protest\". The cover features a cartoon drawing by Capp of wildly dressed, angry hippies carrying protest signs with slogans like \"End Capp Brutality\", \"Abner and Daisy Mae Smoke Pot\", \"Capp Is Over [30, 40, 50\u2014all crossed out] the Hill!!\", and \"If You Like Crap, You'll Like Capp!\"\n\nHighlights of the strip's final decades include \"Boomchik\" (1961), in which America's international prestige is saved by Mammy Yokum, \"Daisy Mae Steps Out\" (1966), a female-empowering tale of Daisy's brazenly audacious \"homewrecker gland\", \"The Lips of Marcia Perkins\" (1967), a satirical, thinly-veiled commentary on [[venereal disease]] and public health warnings, \"Ignoble Savages\" (1968), in which [[Mafia|the Mob]] takes over Harvard, and \"Corporal Crock\" (1973), in which Bullmoose reveals his reactionary cartoon role model, in a tale of obsession and the fanatical world of comic book collecting.\n\nThe cartoonist visited [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] at their 1969 [[Bed-In for Peace]] in [[Montreal]], and their testy exchange later appeared in the documentary film ''[[Imagine: John Lennon]]'' (1988). Introducing himself with the words \"I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist. How do you do?,\" Capp sardonically congratulated Lennon and Ono on their ''[[Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins|Two Virgins]]'' nude album cover: \"I think that everybody owes it to the world to prove they have pubic hair. You've done it, and I tell you that I applaud you for it.\" Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono (\"Good God, you've gotta live with that?\"), and was asked to \"get out\" by [[Derek Taylor]]. Lennon allowed him to stay, however, but the conversation had soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his ''[[Ballad of John and Yoko]]'' song with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: \"Christ, you know it ain't easy / You know how hard it can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify ''Capp!'' \"<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/i/imagine-john-lennon-script-transcript.html Imagine: John Lennon Script - transcript from the screenplay and/or documentary movie about John Lennon]</ref>\n\nDespite his political conservatism in the last decade of his life, Capp is reported to have been liberal in some particular causes; he supported [[gay rights]], and did not tolerate any attempts at homophobic jokes.<ref name=\"printmag.com\"/> He is also said to have supported [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the fight for racial equality in American society, although he was very sceptical of the tactics of [[Black Panthers]] and [[Malcolm X]].<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary (2013) Bloomsbury Publishing, p. 196</ref>\n\nIn 1968, a [[theme park]] called [[Dogpatch USA]] opened at Marble Falls, [[Arkansas]], based on Capp's work and with his support. The park was a popular attraction during the 1970s, but was abandoned in 1993 due to financial difficulties. By 2005, the area once devoted to a live-action facsimile of Dogpatch (including a lifesize statue in the town square of Dogpatch \"founder\" General Jubilation T. Cornpone) had been heavily stripped by vandals and souvenir hunters, and was slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding Arkansas wilderness.\n\nOn April 22, 1971, syndicated [[columnist]] Jack Anderson reported allegations that Capp made indecent advances to four female students when he was invited to speak at the [[University of Alabama]] in February 1968. Anderson and an associate confirmed that Capp was shown out of town by university police, but that the incident had been hushed up by the university to avoid negative publicity.<ref>[[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Anderson, Jack]], \"Washington Merry-Go-Round,\" April 22, 1971</ref>\n\nThe following month, Capp was charged in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]], in connection with another alleged incident following his April 1 lecture at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire|University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire]].<ref>\"Al Capp Accused on Moral Counts at Eau Claire U.\"; ''[[The Capital Times]]'', May 7, 1971</ref> Capp was accused of propositioning a married woman in his hotel room. Although no sexual act was alleged to have resulted, the original charge included [[Sodomy laws in the United States|\"sodomy\"]]. As part of a plea agreement, Capp pleaded guilty to the charge of \"attempted adultery\" (adultery was a felony in Wisconsin <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vanwagnerwood.com/CM/Custom/Adultery.asp |title= Adultery is a crime in Wisconsin {{!}} Law Offices of criminal defense attorneys Christopher Van Wagner and Tracey Wood, Madison WI |access-date= 2008-06-30 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516092007/http://www.vanwagnerwood.com/CM/Custom/Adultery.asp |archive-date= 2008-05-16 |url-status= dead }}</ref>) and the other charges were dropped. Capp was fined $500 and court costs.<ref>\"Al Capp Admits One Morals Count; Pays $500 Fine\"; ''[[The Capital Times]],'' February 12, 1972</ref> In a December 1992 article for ''[[The New Yorker]],'' [[Seymour Hersh]] reported that President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Charles Colson]] had repeatedly discussed the Capp case in Oval Office recordings that had recently been made available by the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]. Nixon and Capp were on friendly terms, Hersh wrote, and Nixon and Colson had worked to find a way for Capp to run against [[Ted Kennedy]] for the U.S. Senate. \"Nixon was worried about the allegations, fearing that Capp's very close links to the White House would become embarrassingly public\", Hersh wrote. \"The White House tapes and documents show that he and Colson discussed the issue repeatedly, and that Colson eventually reassured the president by saying that he had, in essence, fixed the case. Specifically, the president was told that one of Colson's people had gone to Wisconsin and tried to talk to the prosecutors.\" Colson's efforts failed, however. The Eau Claire district attorney, a Republican, refused to dismiss the attempted adultery charge.<ref>[[Seymour Hersh|Hersh, Seymour]], \"Nixon's Last Cover-Up: The Tapes He Wants the Archives to Suppress\"; ''[[The New Yorker]]'', December 14, 1992, pp. 80\u201381</ref> In passing sentence in February 1972, the judge rejected the D.A.'s motion that Capp agree to undergo psychiatric treatment.\n\nThe resulting publicity led to hundreds of papers dropping his comic strip,<ref name=\"salon\">[http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/09/30/capp/index.html?pn= Dogpatch confidential - Salon.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304230031/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/09/30/capp/index.html?pn= |date=2008-03-04}}</ref> and Capp, already in failing health, withdrew from public speaking. [[Celebrity biographer]] James Spada has claimed that similar allegations were made by actress [[Grace Kelly]]. However, no firsthand allegation has ever surfaced.<ref>Spada, James, ''Grace: The Secret Lives of a Princess''. Garden City, NY: Doubleday & Company, 1987, p.37</ref>\n\n\"From beginning to end, Capp was acid-tongued toward the targets of his wit, intolerant of hypocrisy, and always wickedly funny. After about 40 years, however, Capp's interest in ''Abner'' waned, and this showed in the strip itself,\" according to [[Don Markstein]]'s ''[[Toonopedia]]''. On November 13, 1977, Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the recently declining quality of the strip, which he said had been the best he could manage due to declining health. \"If you have any sense of humor about your strip\u2014and I had a sense of humor about mine\u2014you knew that for three or four years ''Abner'' was wrong. Oh hell, it's like a fighter retiring. I stayed on longer than I should have,\" he admitted,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948819,00.html Mr. Dogpatch - 1979 TIME obituary]</ref> adding that he couldn't breathe anymore. \"When he retired ''Li'l Abner'', newspapers ran expansive articles and television commentators talked about the passing of an era. ''[[People magazine]]'' ran a substantial feature, and even the comics-free ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' devoted nearly a full page to the event\", wrote publisher [[Denis Kitchen]].\n\nCapp's final years were marked by advancing illness and by family tragedy. In October 1977, one of his two daughters died; a few weeks later, a beloved granddaughter was killed in a car accident. A lifelong chain smoker, Capp died in 1979 from [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]] at his home in [[South Hampton, New Hampshire]].<ref>[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x546276190/Al-Capp-was-here Al Capp Was Here ''Newburyport Daily News'' Sept. 27, 2009]</ref> Capp is buried in Mount Prospect Cemetery in Amesbury, Massachusetts. Engraved on his headstone is a stanza from [[Thomas Gray]]: ''The plowman homeward plods his weary way / And leaves the world to darkness and to me'' (from ''[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]'', 1751).\n\n==Legacy==\n\"Neither the strip's shifting political leanings nor the slide of its final few years had any bearing on its status as a classic; and in 1995, it was recognized as such by the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]]\", according to ''Toonopedia''. ''Li'l Abner'' was one of 20 American comic strips included in the [[Comic Strip Classics]] series of USPS [[commemorative stamp]]s. Al Capp, an inductee into the [[National Cartoon Museum]] (formerly the International Museum of Cartoon Art), is one of only 31 artists selected to their [[Hall of Fame]]. Capp was also inducted into the [[Will Eisner Award]] Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\n[[Sadie Hawkins Day]] and [[:wikt:double whammy|double whammy]] are two terms attributed to Al Capp that have entered the English language. Other, less ubiquitous Cappisms include [[skunk works]] and [[Lower Slobbovia]]. The term [[shmoo]] also has entered the [[lexicon]], defining highly technical concepts in no fewer than ''four'' separate fields of science, including the variations [[Mating of yeast|shmooing]] (a [[microbiological]] term for the \"budding\" process in yeast reproduction), and [[shmoo plot]] (a technical term in the field of [[electrical engineering]]). In [[socioeconomics]], a \"shmoo\" refers to any generic kind of good that reproduces itself, (as opposed to \"[[widget (economics)|widget]]s\" which require resources and active production). In the field of [[particle physics]], \"shmoo\" refers to a high energy survey instrument, as used at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] to capture subatomic [[cosmic ray]] particles emitted from the [[Cygnus X-3]] [[constellation]]. Capp also had a knack for popularizing certain uncommon terms, such as [[List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom|druthers]], [[schmooze]], and [[-nik|nogoodnik, neatnik, etc.]] In his book ''[[The American Language]]'', [[H.L. Mencken]] credits the postwar mania for adding \"-nik\" to the ends of adjectives to create nouns as beginning\u2014not with [[beatnik]] or [[Sputnik]]\u2014but earlier, in the pages of ''Li'l Abner''.\n\nAl Capp's life and career are the subjects of a new life-sized [[mural]] commemorating the 100th anniversary of his birth. Created by resident artist [[Jon P. Mooers]], the mural was unveiled in downtown [[Amesbury, Massachusetts|Amesbury]] on May 15, 2010.<ref>[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x1612544031/Town-to-honor-famous-cartoonist-who-lived-worked-in-Amesbury#comment-45683673 Town to Honor Famous Cartoonist Who Lived, Worked in Amesbury ''Newburyport Daily News'' April 20, 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2010/05/15/amesbury_gives_lil_abner_his_due/?page=full Amesbury Gives Li'l Abner His Due ''Boston Globe'' May 15, 2010]</ref> According to the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' (as reported on May 18, 2010), the town has renamed its amphitheater in the artist's honor, and is looking to develop an Al Capp Museum. Capp is also the subject of an upcoming [[WNET-TV]] ''[[American Masters]]'' [[documentary]], ''The Life and Times of Al Capp'', produced by his granddaughter, independent filmmaker Caitlin Manning.\n\nSince his death in 1979, Al Capp and his work have been the subject of more than 40 books, including three biographies. [[Underground comix|Underground cartoonist]] and ''Li'l Abner'' expert [[Denis Kitchen]] has published, co-published, edited, or otherwise served as consultant on nearly all of them. Kitchen is currently compiling a biographical [[monograph]] on Al Capp.\n\nAt the [[San Diego Comic Con]] in July 2009, [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] announced the upcoming publication of ''Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Complete Dailies and Color Sundays'' as part of their ongoing [[The Library of American Comics]] series. The comprehensive series, a reprinting of the entire 43-year history of ''Li'l Abner'' spanning a projected 20 volumes, began on April 7, 2010.<ref>[http://www.libraryofamericancomics.com/catalog/series/1101/ IDW Library of American Comics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511032402/http://www.libraryofamericancomics.com/catalog/series/1101/ |date=2010-05-11 }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category-inline|Al Capp}}\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*Capp, Al, ''Li'l Abner in New York'' (1936) [[Whitman Publishing]]\n*Capp, Al, ''Li'l Abner Among the Millionaires'' (1939) Whitman Publishing\n*Capp, Al, ''Li'l Abner and Sadie Hawkins Day'' (1940) [[Saalfield Publishing]]\n*Capp, Al, ''Li'l Abner and the Ratfields'' (1940) Saalfield Publishing\n*Sheridan, Martin, ''Comics and Their Creators'' (1942) R.T.

He also wrote the comic strips ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'' (in the years 1937\u201345) and ''[[Long Sam]]'' (1954). He won the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben Award]] in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year, and their 1979 [[E. C. Segar|Elzie Segar Award]], posthumously for his \"unique and outstanding contribution to the profession of cartooning\". Comic strips dealt with northern urban experiences until the year Capp introduced \"Li'l Abner\", the first strip based in the South. Although Capp was from Connecticut, he spent 43 years teaching the world about Dogpatch, reaching an estimated 60 million readers in more than 900 American newspapers and 100 foreign papers in 28 countries. [[M. Thomas Inge]] says Capp made a large personal fortune through the strip and \"had a profound influence on the way the world viewed the American South\".<ref>M. Thomas Inge, \"Li'l Abner, Snuffy, Pogo, and Friends: The South in the American Comic Strip,\" ''Southern Quarterly'' (2011) 48#2 pp 6-74</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], of East European Jewish heritage, Capp was the eldest child of Otto Philip Caplin (1885-1964)<ref>[https://www.geni.com/people/Otto-Caplin/6000000003443607986 Otto Philip Caplin at Geni.com]</ref> and Matilda (Davidson) Caplin (1884-1948).<ref>[https://www.geni.com/people/Matilda-Davidson/6000000003443619277 Matilda Davidson at Geni.com]</ref> His brothers, Elliott and Jerome, were cartoonists, and his sister, Madeline, was a publicist. Capp's parents were both natives of [[Latvia]] whose families had migrated to New Haven in the 1880s. \"My mother and father had been brought to this country from Russia when they were infants\", wrote Capp in 1978. \"Their fathers had found that the great promise of America was true&nbsp;\u2014 it was no crime to be a Jew.\" The Caplins were dirt-poor, and Capp later recalled stories of his mother going out in the night to sift through ash barrels for reusable bits of coal.\n\nIn August 1919, at the age of nine, Capp was run down by a [[Tram|trolley car]] and had to have his left leg amputated, well above the knee.<ref>See [http://lil-abner.com/al-capp/ Li'l Abner Official Site: Al Capp biography]</ref> According to his father Otto's unpublished autobiography, young Capp was not prepared for the amputation beforehand; having been in a coma for days, he suddenly awoke to discover that his leg was removed.<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) p. 4</ref> He was eventually given a prosthetic leg, but only learned to use it by adopting a slow way of walking which became increasingly painful as he grew older.<ref>See [http://www.tcj.com/reviews/al-capp-a-life-to-the-contrary/ Review: \"Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary,\" by R.C. Harvey, published March 14, 2013]</ref> The childhood tragedy of losing a leg likely helped shape Capp's cynical worldview, which was darker and more sardonic than that of the average newspaper cartoonist.<ref>see [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811832,00.html \"Inhuman Man,\" ''Time'', February 6, 1950]</ref> \"I was indignant as hell about that leg\", he would reveal in a November 1950 interview in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.\n\n\"The secret of how to live without resentment or embarrassment in a world in which I was different from everyone else\", Capp philosophically wrote (in ''[[Life magazine]]'' on May 23, 1960), \"was to be indifferent to that difference.\"<ref>see [https://books.google.com/books?id=3k4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA129&dq=Al+Capp&as_pt=MAGAZINES#v=onepage&q=Al%20Capp&f=false ''Life'', 23 May 1960, pp. 129\u2013140]</ref> The prevailing opinion among his friends was that Capp's [[Jonathan Swift|Swiftian]] satire was, to some degree, a creatively channeled, compensatory response to his disability.\n[[File:Al Capp Self-portrait April 1951.JPG|right|450px|thumb|\"I do ''Li'l Abner!!'',\" a self-portrait by Al Capp, excerpted from the<br />April 16\u201317, 1951 ''Li'l Abner'' strips, note the reference to [[Milton Caniff]]]]\nCapp's father, a failed businessman and an amateur cartoonist, introduced him to drawing as a form of therapy. He became quite proficient, advancing mostly on his own. Among his earliest influences were ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoonist\u2013illustrator [[Phil May (caricaturist)|Phil May]], and American comic strip cartoonists [[Thomas Aloysius Dorgan|Tad Dorgan]], [[Cliff Sterrett]], [[Rube Goldberg]], [[Rudolph Dirks]], [[Frederick Burr Opper|Fred Opper]], [[Billy DeBeck]], [[George McManus]], and [[Milt Gross]]. At about this same time, Capp became a voracious reader. According to Capp's brother Elliot, Alfred had finished all of Shakespeare and [[George Bernard Shaw]] by the time he turned 13. Among his childhood favorites were [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Booth Tarkington]], and later, [[Robert Benchley]] and [[S. J. Perelman]].\n\nCapp spent five years at Bridgeport High School in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], without receiving a diploma. He liked to joke about how he failed geometry for nine straight terms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bridgeport.ct.schoolwebpages.com/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=5111 |title=Web page at Bridgeport Central High School devoted to Al Capp |access-date=2006-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185724/http://bridgeport.ct.schoolwebpages.com/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=5111 |archive-date=2007-09-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His formal training came from a series of art schools in the [[New England]] area. Attending three of them in rapid succession, the impoverished Capp was thrown out of each for nonpayment of tuition&mdash;the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum School of Fine Arts]], the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], and Designers Art School in Boston&mdash;the last before launching his career. Capp already had decided to become a cartoonist. \"I heard that [[Bud Fisher]] (creator of ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'') got $3,000 a week and was constantly marrying French countesses\", Capp said. \"I decided that was for me.\"\n\nIn early 1932, Capp hitchhiked to [[New York City]]. He lived in \"airless rat holes\" in [[Greenwich Village]] and turned out advertising strips at $2-apiece while scouring the city hunting for jobs. He eventually found work at the [[Associated Press]] when he was 23 years old. By March 1932, Capp was drawing ''Colonel Gilfeather'', a single-panel, AP-owned property created in 1930 by [[Richard Dorgan|Dick Dorgan]]. Capp changed the focus and title to ''Mister Gilfeather'', but soon grew to hate the feature. He left the Associated Press in September 1932. Before leaving, he met [[Milton Caniff]] and the two became lifelong friends. Capp moved to [[Boston]] and married Catherine Wingate Cameron, whom he had met earlier in art class. She died in 2006 at the age of 96.\n\nLeaving his new wife with her parents in [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]], he subsequently returned to New York in 1933, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]]. \"I was 23, I carried a mass of drawings, and I had nearly five dollars in my pocket. People were sleeping in alleys then, willing to work at anything.\" There he met [[Ham Fisher]], who hired him to ghost on ''[[Joe Palooka]]''. During one of Fisher's extended vacations, Capp's ''Joe Palooka'' [[story arc]] introduced a stupid, coarse, oafish mountaineer named \"Big Leviticus,\" a crude [[prototype]]. (Leviticus was much closer to Capp's later villains Lem and Luke Scragg, than to the much more appealing and innocent Li'l Abner.)\n\nAlso during this period, Capp was working at night on samples for the strip that would eventually become ''[[Li'l Abner]]''. He based his cast of characters on the authentic mountain-dwellers he met while hitchhiking through rural [[West Virginia]] and the [[Cumberland Valley]] as a teenager. (This was years before the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Act brought basic utilities such as electricity and running water to the region.) Leaving ''Joe Palooka'', Capp sold ''Li'l Abner'' to [[United Feature Syndicate]] (later known as [[United Media]]). The feature was launched on Monday, August 13, 1934, in eight North American newspapers&mdash;including the ''[[New York Mirror]]''&mdash;and was an immediate success. Alfred G. Caplin eventually became \"Al Capp\" because the syndicate felt the original would not fit in a cartoon frame.<ref>A review of the 1934 strips reveals that the earliest strips were signed \"Al G. Cap\", which became \"Al G. Capp\" and, finally, \"Al Capp\". However, the middle initial (\"Al G. Capp\") appeared from time to time during the first year.</ref> Capp had his name changed legally in 1949.\n\nHis younger brother [[Elliot Caplin]] also became a comic strip writer, best known for co-creating the [[soap opera]] strip ''[[The Heart of Juliet Jones]]'' with artist [[Stan Drake]] and conceiving the comic strip character ''[[Broom-Hilda]]'' with cartoonist [[Russell Myers]]. Elliot also authored several off-Broadway plays, including ''A Nickel for Picasso'' (1981), which was based on and dedicated to his mother and his famous brother.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/nyregion/theater-a-new-play-explores-fantasies-of-a-man-at-60.html ''New York Times'' theater column by Alvin Klein, November 8, 1987]</ref>\n\n==''Li'l Abner''==\n{{Main|Li'l Abner}}\nWhat began as a [[hillbilly]] [[burlesque]] soon evolved into one of the most imaginative, popular, and well-drawn strips of the twentieth century. Featuring vividly outlandish characters, bizarre situations, and equal parts [[suspense]], [[slapstick]], [[irony]], [[satire]], [[black humor]], and biting [[social commentary]], ''Li'l Abner'' is considered a classic of the genre. The comic strip stars Li'l Abner Yokum\u2014the simple-minded, loutish but good-natured, and eternally innocent hayseed who lives with his parents\u2014scrawny but superhuman Mammy Yokum, and shiftless, childlike Pappy Yokum.\n\n\"Yokum\" was a combination of ''yokel'' and ''hokum'', although Capp established a deeper meaning for the name during a series of visits around 1965\u20131970 with comics historians George E. Turner and Michael H. Price. \"It's phonetic [[Hebrew]]\u2014that's what it is, all right\u2014and that's what I was getting at with the name Yokum, more so than any attempt to sound ''hickish''\", said Capp. \"That was a fortunate coincidence, of course, that the name should pack a backwoods connotation. But it's a godly conceit, really, playing off a godly name\u2014''[[Joachim]]'' means 'God's determination', something like that\u2014that also happens to have a rustic ring to it.\"<ref>[http://www.comicmix.com/news/2007/11/11/li-l-abner-lost-in-hollywood-shuffle-by-michael-h-price/ \"Li'l Abner Lost In Hollywood\" by Michael H. Price]</ref>\n\nThe Yokums live in the backwater hamlet of [[Dogpatch]], [[Kentucky]]. Described by its creator as \"an average stone-age community\", Dogpatch mostly consists of hopelessly ramshackle log cabins, pine trees, \"tarnip\" fields, and \"hawg\" wallows. Whatever energy Abner had went into evading the marital goals of Daisy Mae Scragg, his sexy, well-endowed (but virtuous) girlfriend\u2014until Capp finally gave in to reader pressure and allowed the couple to marry. This newsworthy event made the cover of ''Life'' on March 31, 1952.\n\nCapp peopled his comic strip with an assortment of memorable characters, including Marryin' Sam, Hairless Joe, Lonesome Polecat, Evil-Eye Fleegle, General Bullmoose, Lena the Hyena, Senator Jack S. Phogbound (Capp's caricature of the anti-[[New Deal]] [[Dixiecrats]]), the ''(shudder!)'' Scraggs, Available Jones, Nightmare Alice, Earthquake McGoon, and a host of others. Most notably, certainly from a [[GI (military)|G.I.]] point of view, are the beautiful, full-figured women such as Daisy Mae, Wolf Gal, Stupefyin' Jones, and Moonbeam McSwine (a caricature of his wife Catherine, aside from the dirt)\u2014all of whom found their way onto the [[nose art|painted noses]] of [[bomber aircraft|bomber planes]] during World War II and the Korean War. Perhaps Capp's most popular creations were the [[Shmoo]]s, creatures whose incredible usefulness and generous nature made them a threat to civilization as we know it. Another famous character was [[Joe Btfsplk]], who wants to be a loving friend, but is \"the world's worst jinx\", bringing bad luck to all those nearby. Btfsplk (his name is \"pronounced\" by simply blowing a \"raspberry\" or [[Bronx cheer (gesture)|Bronx cheer]]) always has an iconic dark cloud over his head.\n\nDogpatch residents regularly combat the likes of city slickers, business tycoons, government officials, and intellectuals with their homespun simplicity. Situations often take the characters to other destinations, including New York City, Washington, D.C., Hollywood, tropical islands, the Moon, Mars, and some purely fanciful worlds of Capp's invention. The last includes El Passionato, Kigmyland, The Republic of Crumbumbo, Skunk Hollow, The Valley of the Shmoon, Planets Pincus Number 2 and 7, and a miserable frozen wasteland known as [[Lower Slobbovia]], a pointedly political satire of backward nations and foreign diplomacy that remains a contemporary reference.<ref>{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Russell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/13/opinion/observer-hillary-in-lower-slobbovia.html |title=Hillary in Lower Slobbovia - '&#39;NY Times'&#39; Jan. 13, 1996 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1996-01-13 |access-date=2009-08-29}}</ref> \"Indeed, ''Li'l Abner'' incorporates such a panoply of characters and ideas that it defies summary\", according to cultural historian Anthony Harkins. \"Yet though Capp's storylines often wandered far afield, his hillbilly setting remained a central touchstone, serving both as a microcosm and a distorting carnival mirror of broader American society.\"<ref>''Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon'' by Anthony Harkins (2004, Oxford Univ. Press) pp. 124\u2013136</ref>\n\nThe strip's popularity grew from an original eight papers, to ultimately more than 900. At its peak, ''Li'l Abner'' was estimated to have been read daily in the United States by 60 to 70 million people (the U.S. population at the time was only 180 million), with adult readers far outnumbering children. Many communities, high schools and colleges staged [[Sadie Hawkins dance]]s, patterned after the similar annual event in the strip.\n\nLi'l Abner has one odd design quirk that has puzzled readers for decades: the part in his hair always faces the viewer, no matter which direction Abner is facing. In response to the question \"Which side does Abner part his hair on?\", Capp would answer, \"Both.\" Capp said he finally found the right \"look\" for Li'l Abner with [[Henry Fonda]]'s character Dave Tolliver, in ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936 film)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'' (1936).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=U99JAAAAMAAJ&q=fonda+%22li%27l+abner%22&dq=fonda+%22li%27l+abner%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=0 Steen, Mike ''Hollywood Speaks: An Oral History'' Putnam, 1974]</ref> In later years, Capp always claimed to have effectively created the [[miniskirt]], when he first put one on Daisy Mae in 1934.\n\n==Parodies, toppers, and alternate strips==\n''Li'l Abner'' also features a comic strip-within-the-strip: ''[[Fearless Fosdick]]'' is a parody of [[Chester Gould]]'s ''[[Dick Tracy]]''. It first appeared in 1942, and proved so popular that it ran intermittently during the next 35 years. Gould was parodied personally in the series as cartoonist \"Lester Gooch\"\u2014the diminutive, much-harassed and occasionally deranged \"creator\" of Fosdick. The style of the ''Fosdick'' sequences closely mimicks ''Tracy'', including the urban setting, the outrageous villains, the galloping [[mortality rate]], the crosshatched shadows, and even the lettering style. In 1952, Fosdick was the star of his own short-lived [[puppet show]] on [[NBC]], featuring the Mary Chase [[marionette]]s.\n\nBesides ''Dick Tracy'', Capp parodied many other comic strips in ''Li'l Abner''\u2014including ''[[Steve Canyon]]'', ''[[Superman (comic strip)|Superman]]'' (at least twice; first as \"Jack Jawbreaker\" in 1947, and again in 1966 as \"Chickensouperman\"), ''[[Mary Worth]]'' as \"Mary Worm\", ''[[Peanuts]]'' {with \"Peewee\" a parody of Charlie Brown with \"Croopy\" parody of [[Snoopy]]\" {1968} drawn by Bedley Damp a parody of [[Charles Schulz]]}, ''[[Rex Morgan, M.D.]]'', ''[[Little Annie Rooney]]'', and ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' (in which Punjab became \"Punjbag,\" an oleaginous slob). ''Fearless Fosdick''\u2014and Capp's other spoofs such as \"Little Fanny Gooney\" (1952) and \"Jack Jawbreaker\"\u2014were almost certainly an early inspiration for [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s ''[[Mad Magazine]]'', which began in 1952 as a [[comic book]] that specifically parodied other comics in the same distinctive style and subversive manner.\n\nCapp also lampooned popular recording idols of the day, such as [[Elvis Presley]] (\"Hawg McCall\", 1957), [[Liberace]] (\"Loverboynik\", 1956), [[the Beatles]] (\"the Beasties\", 1964)\u2014and in 1944, [[Frank Sinatra]]. \"Sinatra was the first great public figure I ever wrote about,\" Capp once said. \"I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' I remember my news syndicate was so worried about what his reaction might be, and we were all surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always made it a point to send me a spent condom whenever he happened to see me in a restaurant{{nbsp}}...\" (from ''Frank Sinatra, My Father'' by [[Nancy Sinatra]], 1985). On the other hand, Liberace was \"cut to the quick\" over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal action\u2014as would [[Joan Baez]] later, over \"Joanie Phoanie\" in 1967.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/topic/Al_Capp/ UPI Photo/Files Al Capp Jan. 11, 1967]</ref>\n\nCapp was just as likely to parody himself; his self-caricature made frequent, tongue-in-cheek appearances in ''Li'l Abner''.<ref>''Anything Can Happen in a Comic Strip: Centennial Reflections on an American Art Form'' by [[M. Thomas Inge]] (1995) University Press of Mississippi, pp. 18\u201319</ref> The gag was often at his own expense, as in the above 1951 sequence showing Capp's interaction with \"fans\" (see excerpt), or in his 1955 [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] parody, \"Hal Yappland\". Just about anything could be a target for Capp's satire\u2014in one storyline Li'l Abner is revealed to be the [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]] between ape and man. In another, the search is on in Dogpatch for a pair of missing socks knitted by the first president of the United States.\n \nIn addition to creating ''Li'l Abner'', Capp also co-created two other newspaper strips: ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'' with magazine illustrator [[Raeburn van Buren]] in 1937, and ''[[Long Sam]]'' with cartoonist [[Bob Lubbers]] in 1954, as well as the Sunday \"[[topper (comic strip)|topper]]\" strips ''Washable Jones'', ''Small Fry'' (a.k.a. ''Small Change''), and ''Advice fo' Chillun''.\n\n==Critical recognition==\nAccording to comics historian [[Coulton Waugh]], a 1947 poll of newspaper readers who claimed they ignored the comics page altogether revealed that many confessed to making a single exception: ''Li'l Abner''. \"When ''Li'l Abner'' made its debut in 1934, the vast majority of comic strips were designed chiefly to amuse or thrill their readers. Capp turned that world upside-down by routinely injecting politics and social commentary into ''Li'l Abner''. The strip was the first to regularly introduce characters and story lines having nothing to do with the nominal stars of the strip. The technique\u2014as invigorating as it was unorthodox\u2014was later adopted by cartoonists such as [[Walt Kelly]] [''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''] and [[Garry Trudeau]] [''[[Doonesbury]]'']\", wrote comic strip historian [[Rick Marschall]]. According to Marschall, ''Li'l Abner'' gradually evolved into a broad satire of [[human nature]]. In his book ''America's Great Comic Strip Artists'' (1989), Marschall's analysis revealed a decidedly [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] subtext.\n\nOver the years, ''Li'l Abner'' has been adapted to radio, [[Character animation|animated cartoons]], stage production, [[motion pictures]], and television. Capp has been compared, at various times, to Mark Twain, [[Dostoevski]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Lawrence Sterne]], and [[Rabelais]].<ref>Brown, Rodger, \"Dogpatch USA: The Road to Hokum\" article, ''Southern Changes: The Journal of the Southern Regional Council'', Vol. 15, No. 3, 1993, pp. 18-26</ref> Fans of the strip ranged from novelist [[John Steinbeck]], who called Capp \"possibly the best writer in the world today\" in 1953, and even earnestly recommended him for the Nobel Prize in literature\u2014to media critic and theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]], who considered Capp \"the only robust satirical force in American life\". [[John Updike]], comparing Abner to a \"hillbilly [[Candide]]\", added that the strip's \"richness of social and philosophical commentary approached the [[Voltairean]]\".<ref>[http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_2_urb-al-capp.html Exile in Dogpatch: The Curious Neglect of Cartoonist Al Capp, ''City Journal,'' Spring 2010]</ref> [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[William F.

''Li'l Abner: A Study in American Satire'' by [[Arthur Asa Berger]] (Twayne, 1969) contained serious analyses of Capp's narrative technique, his use of dialogue, self-caricature, and grotesquerie, the place of ''Li'l Abner'' in American satire, and the significance of social criticism and the graphic image. \"One of the few strips ever taken seriously by students of American culture,\" wrote Professor Berger, \"''Li'l Abner'' is worth studying ... because of Capp's imagination and artistry, and because of the strip's very obvious social relevance.\" It was reprinted by the [[University Press of Mississippi]] in 1994.\n\n==The 1940s and 1950s==\n[[File:Cappbio46.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Al Capp drew his own autobiography, the 34-page ''Al Capp by Li'l Abner'' (1946), that was distributed to returning World War II amputee veterans.]]\nDuring World War II and for many years afterward, Capp worked tirelessly going to [[hospital]]s to entertain patients, especially to cheer recent amputees and explain to them that the loss of a limb did not mean an end to a happy and productive life. Making no secret of his own disability, Capp openly joked about his [[prosthetic]] leg his whole life. In 1946, Capp created a special full-color comic book, ''Al Capp by Li'l Abner'', to be distributed by the [[Red Cross]] to encourage the thousands of amputee veterans returning from the war. Capp also was involved with the [[Elizabeth Kenny|Sister Kenny Foundation]], which pioneered new treatments for [[polio]] in the 1940s. Serving in his capacity as honorary chairman, Capp made public appearances on its behalf for years, contributed free artwork for its annual fundraising appeals, and entertained crippled and [[paraplegic]] children in children's hospitals with inspirational pep talks, humorous stories, and sketches.<ref>[http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/05/dont-keep-remembering-what-youve-lost.html Letters of Note: Dear Chip... (Columbus Hospital, 28 May 1964)]</ref>\n\nIn 1940, an [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] [[Li'l Abner (1940 film)|movie adaptation]] starred Granville Owen (later known as [[Jeff York]]) as Li'l Abner, with [[Buster Keaton]] taking the role of Lonesome Polecat, and featuring a title song with lyrics by [[Milton Berle]]. A successful musical comedy adaptation of the strip opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the St. James Theater on November 15, 1956, and had a long run of 693 performances, followed by a nationwide tour. The [[Li'l Abner (musical)|stage musical]], with music and lyrics by [[Gene de Paul]] and [[Johnny Mercer]], was adapted into a [[Technicolor]] [[Li'l Abner (1959 film)|motion picture]] at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in 1959 by producer [[Norman Panama]] and director [[Melvin Frank]], with a score by [[Nelson Riddle]]. Several performers repeated their Broadway roles in the film, most memorably [[Julie Newmar]] as Stupefyin' Jones and [[Stubby Kaye]] as Marryin' Sam.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F04E3D9103CE63BBC4A52DFB4678382649EDE The Screen 'Li'l Abner' - New York Times Review]</ref>\n\nOther highlights of that decade included the 1942 debut of Fearless Fosdick as Abner's \"ideel\" (hero); the 1946 Lena the Hyena Contest, in which a hideous Lower Slobbovian gal was ultimately revealed in the harrowing winning entry (as judged by Frank Sinatra, [[Boris Karloff]], and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]) drawn by noted cartoonist [[Basil Wolverton]]; and an ill-fated Sunday parody of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone With the Wind]]'' that aroused anger and legal threats from author [[Margaret Mitchell]], and led to a printed apology within the strip. In October 1947, Li'l Abner met Rockwell P. Squeezeblood, head of the abusive and corrupt Squeezeblood Comic Strip Syndicate. The resulting sequence, \"Jack Jawbreaker Fights Crime!\", was a devastating satire of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s notorious exploitation by [[DC Comics]] over ''[[Superman]]''. It was later reprinted in ''The World of Li'l Abner'' (1953). (Siegel and Shuster had earlier poked fun at Capp in a ''Superman'' story in ''[[Action Comics]] #55'', December 1942, in which a cartoonist named \"Al Hatt\" invents a comic strip featuring the hillbilly \"Tiny Rufe\".)\n\nIn 1947, Capp earned a ''[[Newsweek]]'' cover story. That same year the ''[[New Yorker magazine|New Yorker's]]'' profile on him was so long that it ran in consecutive issues. In 1948, Capp reached a creative peak with the introduction of the [[Shmoo]]s, lovable and innocent fantasy creatures who reproduced at amazing speed and brought so many benefits that, ironically, the world economy was endangered. The much-copied storyline was a [[parable]] that was [[metaphor]]ically interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the [[Cold War]].\n\nFollowing his close friend Milton Caniff's lead (with ''[[Steve Canyon]]''), Capp had recently fought a successful battle with the syndicate to gain complete ownership of his feature when the Shmoos debuted. As a result, he reaped enormous financial rewards from the unexpected (and almost unprecedented) merchandising phenomenon that followed. As in the strip, Shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950\u2014including a ''Time'' cover story. A paperback collection of the original sequence, ''The Life and Times of the Shmoo'', became a bestseller for [[Simon & Schuster]]. Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, [[Halloween]] masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens, and other Shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in [[Baltimore]] turned out a whole line of Shmoo apparel, including \"Shmooveralls\". The original sequence and its 1959 sequel, ''The Return of the Shmoo'', have been collected in print many times since, most recently in 2011, always to high sales figures. The Shmoos would later have their own animated television series.\n\nCapp followed this success with other [[allegory|allegorical]] fantasy critters, including the aboriginal and [[Self-defeating personality disorder|masochistic]] \"Kigmies\", who craved abuse (a story that began as a veiled comment on racial and religious oppression), the dreaded \"Nogoodniks\" (or ''bad'' shmoos), and the irresistible \"Bald Iggle\", a guileless creature whose sad-eyed countenance compelled involuntary truthfulness\u2014with predictably disastrous results.\n\n''Li'l Abner'' was [[censorship|censored]] for the first, but not the last time in September 1947, and was pulled from papers by [[Scripps-Howard]]. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centered on Capp's portrayal of the [[United States Senate]]. Edward Leech of Scripps said, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks&nbsp;... boobs and undesirables.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html Tain't Funny - TIME]</ref> Capp criticized [[Senator Joseph McCarthy]] in 1954, calling him a \"poet\". \"He uses [[poetic license]] to try to create the beautifully ordered world of good guys and bad guys that he wants,\" said Capp. \"He seems at his best when terrifying the helpless and na\u00efve.\"<ref>\"Poet: Cartoonist Al Capp said in New York{{nbsp}}...\" quoted in ''The Argus'', 10 May 1954</ref>\n\nCapp received the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s [[National Cartoonists Society#Billy DeBeck Memorial Award|Billy DeBeck Memorial Award]] in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year. (When the award name was changed in 1954, Capp also retroactively received a [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben]] statuette.) He was an outspoken pioneer in favor of diversifying the NCS by admitting women cartoonists. Originally, the Society had disallowed female members. Capp briefly resigned his membership in 1949 to protest their refusal of admission to [[Hilda Terry]], creator of the comic strip ''[[Teena]]''. According to Tom Roberts, author of ''[[Alex Raymond]]: His Life and Art'' (2007), Capp delivered a stirring speech that was instrumental in changing those rules. The NCS finally accepted female members the following year. In December 1952, Capp published an article in ''Real'' magazine entitled \"The REAL Powers in America\" that further challenged the conventional attitudes of the day: \"The real powers in America are ''women''\u2014the wives and sweethearts behind the masculine dummies&nbsp;...\"\n\nHighlights of the 1950s included the much-heralded marriage of Abner and Daisy Mae in 1952, the birth of their son \"Honest Abe\" Yokum in 1953, and in 1954, the introduction of Abner's enormous, long-lost kid brother Tiny Yokum, who filled Abner's place as a bachelor in the annual Sadie Hawkins Day race. In 1952, Capp and his characters graced the covers of both ''Life'' and ''[[TV Guide]]''. 1956 saw the debut of Bald Iggle, considered by some ''Abner'' enthusiasts to be the creative high point of the strip, as well as Mammy's revelatory encounter with the \"Square Eyes\" Family\u2014Capp's thinly-veiled appeal for racial tolerance. (This [[fable]]-like story was collected into an educational comic book called ''Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!'', and distributed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]] later that year.) Two years later, Capp's studio issued ''[[Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story]]'', a biographical comic book distributed by the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]].<ref name=Grio>Love, David A.

Roaringham Fatback had figured prominently in wiping out the Shmoos. But in 1952, when [[General Motors]] president [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Charles E. Wilson]], nominated for a cabinet post, told [[United States Congress|Congress]] \"...&nbsp;what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa\", he inspired one of Capp's greatest satires\u2014the introduction of General Bullmoose, the robust, ruthless, and ageless business tycoon. The blustering Bullmoose, who seemed to own and control nearly everything, justified his far-reaching and mercenary excesses by saying \"What's good for General Bullmoose is good for ''everybody!''\" Bullmoose's corrupt interests were often pitted against those of the pathetic Lower Slobbovians in a classic mismatch of \"haves\" versus \"have-nots\". This character, along with the Shmoos, helped cement Capp's favor with the [[Left-wing politics|Left]], and would increase their outrage a decade later when Capp, a former [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] liberal, switched targets. Nonetheless, General Bullmoose continued to appear, undaunted and unredeemed, during the strip's final right-wing phase and into the 1970s.\n\n==Feud with Ham Fisher==\nAfter Capp quit his ghosting job on [[Ham Fisher]]'s ''Joe Palooka'' in 1934 to launch his own strip, Fisher badmouthed him to colleagues and editors, claiming that Capp had \"stolen\" his idea. For years, Fisher would bring the characters back to his strip, billing them as \"The ORIGINAL Hillbilly Characters\" and advising readers not to be \"fooled by imitations\". (In fact, Fisher's brutish hillbilly character\u2014Big Leviticus, created by Capp in Fisher's absence\u2014bore little resemblance to Li'l Abner.) According to a November 1950 ''Time'' article, \"Capp parted from Fisher with a definite impression, (to put it mildly) that he had been underpaid and unappreciated. Fisher, a man of Roman self esteem, considered Capp an ingrate and a whippersnapper, and watched his rise to fame with unfeigned horror.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813720-7,00.html Die Monstersinger - TIME]</ref>\n\n\"Fisher repeatedly brought Leviticus and his clan back, claiming their primacy as comics' first hillbilly family&nbsp;\u2014 but he was missing the point. It wasn't the setting that made Capp's strip such a huge success. It was Capp's finely tuned sense of the absurd, his ability to milk an outrageous situation for every laugh in it and then, impossibly, to squeeze even more laughs from it, that found such favor with the public,\" (from [[Don Markstein]]'s ''[[Toonopedia]]'').<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/abner.htm Don Markstein's Toonopedia / Li'l Abner]</ref>\n\nThe Capp-Fisher feud was well known in cartooning circles, and it grew more personal as Capp's strip eclipsed ''Joe Palooka'' in popularity. Fisher hired away Capp's top assistant, [[Moe Leff]]. After Fisher underwent [[plastic surgery]], Capp included a racehorse in ''Li'l Abner'' named \"Ham's Nose-Bob\". In 1950, Capp introduced a cartoonist character named \"Happy Vermin\"\u2014a caricature of Fisher\u2014who hired Abner to draw his comic strip in a dimly lit closet, (after sacking his previous \"temporary\" assistant of 20 years, who had been cut off from all his friends in the process). Instead of using Vermin's tired characters, Abner inventively peopled the strip with hillbillies. A bighearted Vermin told his slaving assistant: \"I'm proud of having created these characters!! They'll make millions for me!! And if they do&nbsp;\u2014 I'll get ''you'' a new light bulb!!\"\n\nTraveling in the same social circles, the two men engaged in a 20-year mutual vendetta, as described by the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' in 1998: \"They crossed paths often, in the midtown watering holes and at National Cartoonists Society banquets, and the city's gossip columns were full of their snarling public donnybrooks.\"<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/09/18/1998-09-18_spitting_on_pictures_funny_p.html Maeder, Jay. \u201cSpitting on Pictures Funny Papers, 1955\u201d, ''Daily News'', September 18, 1998.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008035428/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/09/18/1998-09-18_spitting_on_pictures_funny_p.html |date=October 8, 2009 }}</ref> In 1950, Capp wrote a nasty article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', entitled \"I Remember Monster\". The article recounted Capp's days working for an unnamed \"benefactor\" with a miserly, swinish personality, who Capp claimed was a never-ending source of inspiration when it came time to create a new unregenerate villain for his comic strip. The thinly-veiled boss was understood to be Ham Fisher.\n\nFisher retaliated, doctoring photostats of ''Li'l Abner'' and falsely accusing Capp of sneaking obscenities into his comic strip. Fisher submitted examples of ''Li'l Abner'' to Capp's syndicate and to the New York courts, in which Fisher had identified pornographic images that were hidden in the background art. However, the X-rated material had been drawn there by Fisher. Capp was able to refute the accusation by simply showing the original artwork.\n\nIn 1954, when Capp was applying for a Boston television license, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) received an anonymous packet of pornographic ''Li'l Abner'' drawings. The National Cartoonists Society (NCS) convened an ethics hearing, and Fisher was expelled for the forgery from the same organization that he had helped found; Fisher's scheme had backfired in spectacular fashion. Around the same time, his mansion in Wisconsin was destroyed by a storm. On December 27, 1955, Fisher committed suicide in his studio. The feud and Fisher's suicide were used as the basis for a lurid, highly fictionalized murder mystery, ''Strip for Murder'' by [[Max Allan Collins]].\n\nAnother \"feud\" seemed to be looming when, in one run of Sunday strips in 1957, Capp lampooned the comic strip ''[[Mary Worth]]'' as \"Mary Worm\". The title character was depicted as a nosy, interfering busybody. [[Allen Saunders]], the creator of the ''Mary Worth'' strip, returned Capp's fire with the introduction of the character \"Hal Rapp\", a foul-tempered, ill-mannered, and (ironically) inebriated cartoonist, (Capp was a [[teetotaler]]{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}). Later, the \"feud\" was revealed to be a collaborative hoax that Capp and his longtime pal Saunders had cooked up together. The Capp-Saunders \"feud\" fooled both editors and readers, generated plenty of free publicity for both strips\u2014and Capp and Saunders had a good laugh when all was revealed.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893653,00.html Rap for Capp - TIME]</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nCapp is often associated with two other giants of the medium: [[Milton Caniff]] (''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'', ''Steve Canyon'') and [[Walt Kelly]] (''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]''). The three cartoonists were close personal friends and professional associates throughout their adult lives, and occasionally, referenced each other in their strips. According to one [[anecdote]] (from ''Al Capp Remembered'', 1994), Capp and his brother Elliot ducked out of a dull party at Capp's home\u2014leaving Walt Kelly alone to fend for himself entertaining a group of Argentine envoys who didn't speak English. Kelly retaliated by giving away Capp's [[baby grand piano]]. According to Capp, who loved to relate the story, Kelly's two perfectly logical reasons for doing so were: a. to cement diplomatic relations between [[Argentina]] and the United States, and b. \"Because you can't play the piano, anyway!\" (''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' creator [[Mort Walker]] confirmed the story, relating a slightly expanded version in his autobiography, ''Mort Walker's Private Scrapbook'', 2001.)\n\nMilton Caniff offered another anecdote (from ''Phi Beta Pogo'', 1989) involving Capp and Walt Kelly, \"two boys from [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], nose to nose,\" onstage at a meeting of the Newspaper Comics Council in the sixties. \"Walt would say to Al, 'Of course, Al, this is really how you should draw Daisy Mae, I'm only showing you this for your own good.' Then Walt would do a sketch. Capp, of course, got ticked off by this, as you can imagine! So he retaliated by doing ''his'' version of Pogo. Unfortunately, the drawings are long gone; no recording was made. What a shame! Nobody anticipated there'd be this dueling back and forth between the two of them&nbsp;...\"\n\nAlthough he was often considered a difficult person,<ref name=\"printmag.com\">http://www.printmag.com/interviews/lil-abner-al-capp-monster-cartoonist/</ref> some acquaintances of Capp have stressed that the cartoonist also had a sensitive side. In 1973, when learning that the son of his political rival, [[Ted Kennedy]], had his right leg amputated, Capp wrote the boy a letter of encouragement, giving candid advice as to how to deal with the loss of a limb,<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], p.243</ref> which he had experienced as a boy. One of Capp's grandchildren recalls that at one point, tears were streaming down the cartoonist's cheeks while he was watching a documentary about the [[Jonestown]] massacre.<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], p.244</ref> Also, it is reported that Capp gave money anonymously to charities and \"people in need\" at various points in his life.<ref name=\"printmag.com\"/>\n\n==Sexual misconduct claims==\nIn her autobiography, American actress [[Goldie Hawn]] stated that Capp sexually propositioned her on a [[casting couch]] and exposed himself to her when she was nineteen years old. When she refused his advances, Capp became angry and told her that she was \"never gonna make anything in your life\" and that she should \"go and marry a Jewish dentist. You'll never get anywhere in this business.\"<ref name=couch>[http://people.com/movies/goldie-hawn-remembers-casting-couch-sexual-predator-who-left-her-in-tears-at-19/ Goldie Hawn Remembers the Casting-Couch Sexual Predator Who Left Her in Tears]</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LrI-86BHE0QC&pg=PT113&lpg=PT113&dq=a+lotus+grows+in+the+mud+al+capp#v=onepage&q=a%20lotus%20grows%20in%20the%20mud%20al%20capp&f=false |title=A Lotus Grows in the Mud |last=Hawn |first=Goldie |date=2006-02-28 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9781101205327 |language=en}}</ref>\nTwo biographies, one about Goldie Hawn and the other about [[Grace Kelly]], describe Capp as trying to force Kelly into having sex with him, and he later tried to do the same with Hawn.<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/07/12/cartoonist-al-capp-exposed-in-new-bio/2511355/</ref>\n\nIn 1971, investigative journalist [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] wrote that Capp had exposed his genitals to four female students at the University of Alabama.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/07/12/cartoonist-al-capp-exposed-in-new-bio/2511355/|title=Cartoonist Al Capp exposed in \u2018Life to the Contrary\u2019|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> Then, after an incident at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire, Capp was arrested.

During the extended peak of the strip, the workload grew to include advertising, merchandising, promotional work, public service comics, and other specialty work\u2014in addition to the regular six dailies and one [[Sunday strip]] per week. From the early 1940s to the late 1950s, there were scores of Sunday strip-style magazine ads for [[Cream of Wheat]] using the ''Abner'' characters, and in the 1950s, Fearless Fosdick became a spokesman for Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic in a series of daily strip-style print ads. The characters also sold chainsaws, underwear, ties, detergent, candy, soft drinks\u2014including a licensed version of Capp's moonshine creation, [[Kickapoo Joy Juice]]\u2014and [[General Electric]] and [[Procter & Gamble]] products, all requiring special artwork.\n\nNo matter how much help he had, Capp insisted on his drawing and inking the characters' faces and hands\u2014especially of Abner and Daisy Mae\u2014and his distinctive touch is often discernible. \"He had ''the touch,''\" Frazetta said of Capp in 2008. \"He knew how to take an otherwise ordinary drawing and really make it ''pop''. I'll never knock his talent.\"\n\nAs is usual with collaborative efforts in comic strips, his name was the only one credited\u2014 although, sensitive to his own experience working on ''Joe Palooka'', Capp frequently drew attention to his assistants in interviews and publicity pieces. A 1950 cover story in ''Time'' even included photographs of two of his employees, whose roles in the production were detailed by Capp. Ironically, this highly irregular policy (along with the subsequent fame of Frank Frazetta) has led to the misconception that his strip was \"ghosted\" by other hands. The production of ''Li'l Abner'' has been well documented, however. In point of fact, Capp maintained creative control over every stage of production for virtually the entire run of the strip. Capp originated the stories, wrote the dialogue, designed the major characters, rough penciled the preliminary staging and action of each panel, oversaw the finished pencils, and drew and inked the hands and faces of the characters. Frazetta authority David Winiewicz described the everyday working mode of operation in ''Li'l Abner Dailies: 1954 Volume 20'' (Kitchen Sink, 1994):\n\n{{quote|text=By the time Frazetta began working on the strip, the work of producing ''Li'l Abner'' was too much for one person. Capp had a group of assistants who he taught to reproduce his distinctive individual style, working under his direct supervision. Actual production of the strip began with a rough layout in pencil done by Al Capp, from Capp's script or a co-authored script, and the page would pass to Andy Amato and Walter Johnson. Amato would ink the figures, then Johnson added backgrounds and any mechanical objects. Harvey Curtis was responsible for the lettering and also shared inking duties with Amato&nbsp;... In order to make sure that the work stayed true to his style, the final touches would be added by Capp himself. He enjoyed adding a distinctive glint to an eye or an idiosyncratic contortion to a character's face. The finished strip was truly an ensemble effort, a skillful blending of talents.}}\n\nThere was also a separate line of comic book titles published by the Caplin family-owned [[Toby Press]], including ''Shmoo Comics'' featuring Washable Jones. Cartoonist [[Mell Lazarus]], creator of ''[[Miss Peach]]'' and ''[[Momma]]'', wrote a comic novel in 1963 entitled ''The Boss Is Crazy, Too'' which was partly inspired by his apprenticeship days working with Capp and his brother Elliot at Toby. In a seminar at the [[Charles Schulz Museum]] on November 8, 2008, Lazarus called his experience at Toby \"the five funniest years of my life\". Lazarus went on to cite Capp as one of the \"four essentials\" in the field of newspaper cartoonists, along with Walt Kelly, [[Charles Schulz]], and [[Milton Caniff]].\n\nCapp detailed his approach to writing and drawing the stories in an instructional course book for the [[Famous Artists School]], beginning in 1956. In 1959, Capp recorded and released an album for [[Folkways Records]] (now owned by the [[Smithsonian]]) on which he identified and described \"The Mechanics of the Comic Strip\".<ref>[http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=1284 An Interview with Al Capp - Smithsonian Folkways]</ref>\n\nFrazetta, later famous as a [[fantasy art]]ist, assisted on the strip from 1954 to December, 1961. Fascinated by Frazetta's abilities, Capp initially gave him a free hand in an extended daily sequence (about a biker named \"Frankie,\" a caricature of Frazetta) to experiment with the basic look of the strip by adding a bit more realism and detail (particularly to the inking). After editors complained about the stylistic changes, the strip's previous look was restored. During most of his tenure with Capp, Frazetta's primary responsibility\u2014along with various specialty art, such as a series of ''Li'l Abner'' greeting cards\u2014was tight-penciling the Sunday pages from studio roughs. This work was collected by [[Dark Horse Comics]] in a four-volume hardcover series entitled ''Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Frazetta Years''. In 1961, Capp, complaining of declining revenue, wanted to have Frazetta continue with a 50% pay cut. \"[Capp] said he would cut the salary in half. Goodbye. That was that. ''I'' said goodbye,\" (from ''Frazetta: Painting with Fire''). However, Frazetta returned briefly a few years later to draw a public service comic book called ''Li'l Abner and the Creatures from Drop-Outer Space'', distributed by the [[Job Corps]] in 1965.\n\n==Public service works==\nCapp provided specialty artwork for civic groups, government agencies, and charitable or nonprofit organizations, spanning several decades.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/2012/05/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/\"Presarvin' Freedom: Al Capp, Treasury Man,\" ''Hogan's Alley Online Magazine'', 9 May 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708021015/http://cartoonician.com/2012/05/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/ |date=8 July 2012 }}</ref> The following titles are all single-issue, educational comic books and pamphlets produced for various [[public services]]:\n\n*''Al Capp by Li'l Abner''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] (1946)\n*''Yo' Bets Yo' Life!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Army]] (circa 1950)\n*''Li'l Abner Joins the Navy''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Navy|Dept. of the Navy]] (1950)\n*''Fearless Fosdick and the Case of the Red Feather''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by Red Feather Services, a forerunner of [[United Way of America|United Way]] (1951)\n*''The Youth You Supervise''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (1956)\n*''Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]] (1956)\n*''Operation: Survival!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Civil Defense|Dept. of Civil Defense]] (1957)\n*''Natural Disasters!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the Department of Civil Defense (1957)\n*''[[Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story]]''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by [[The Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (1958)<ref name=Grio />\n*''Li'l Abner and the Creatures from Drop-Outer Space''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Job Corps]] (1965)\n\nIn addition, Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the [[U.S. Treasury]], the Cancer Foundation, the [[March of Dimes]], the National Heart Fund, the Sister Kenny Foundation, the [[Boy Scouts of America]], [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]], the National Reading Council, Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, [[Christmas Seal & Charity Stamp Society|Christmas Seals]], the National Amputation Foundation, and [[Disabled American Veterans]],<ref name=\"news.google.com\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19500511&id=DZZIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4AkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4808,2345975 \"Al Capp Replies to Critic of Newspaper Comic Strips;\" ''The News and Courier'', 11 May 1950]</ref> among others.\n\n==Public figure==\nIn the Golden Age of the American comic strip, successful cartoonists received a great deal of attention; their professional and private lives were reported in the press, and their celebrity was often nearly sufficient to rival their creations. As ''Li'l Abner'' reached its peak years, and following the success of the Shmoos and other high moments in his work, Al Capp achieved a public profile that is still unparalleled in his profession, and arguably exceeded the fame of his strip. \"Capp was the best known, most influential and most controversial cartoonist of his era,\" writes publisher (and leading Shmoo collector) [[Denis Kitchen]]. \"His personal celebrity transcended comics, reaching the public and influencing the culture in a variety of media. For many years he simultaneously produced the daily strip, a weekly syndicated [[newspaper column]], and a 500-station [[radio program]]{{nbsp}}...\" He ran the Boston Summer Theatre with ''[[The Phantom (comics)|The Phantom]]'' cartoonist [[Lee Falk]], bringing in Hollywood actors such as [[Mae West]], [[Melvyn Douglas]], and [[Claude Rains]] to star in their live productions. He even briefly considered running for a Massachusetts Senate seat. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew]] urged Capp to run in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Massachusetts]] primary in 1970 against [[Ted Kennedy]], but Capp ultimately declined. (He did, however, donate his services as a speaker at a $100-a-plate fundraiser for Republican Congressman [[Jack Kemp]].)\n[[File:Al Capp at 1966 Art Festival in Florida.jpg|thumb|Al Capp at 1966 Art Festival in Florida]]\nBesides his use of the comic strip to voice his opinions and display his humor, Capp was a popular guest speaker at universities, and on radio<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779734,00.html The Press: Bane of the Bassinet, ''Time'', 15 March 1948]</ref> and [[television]]. He remains the only cartoonist to be embraced by television; no other comic artist to date has come close to Capp's televised exposure.<ref>[http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reportsitem.aspx?id=102060 Al Capp Views the Networks (April 1952) ''Nieman Reports'']</ref> Capp appeared as a regular on ''[[The Author Meets the Critics]]'' (1948\u2013'54) and made regular, weekly appearances on ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' in 1953. He was also a periodic panelist on ABC and NBC's ''[[Who Said That?]]'' (1948\u2013'55), and co-hosted DuMont's ''[[What's the Story|What's the Story?]]'' (1953). Between 1952 and 1972, he hosted at least ''five'' television shows\u2013three different [[talk show]]s called ''The Al Capp Show'' (1952 and 1968) and ''Al Capp'' (1971\u2013'72), ''Al Capp's America'' (a live \"chalk talk,\" with Capp providing a barbed commentary while sketching cartoons, 1954), and a CBS game show called ''Anyone Can Win'' (1953). He also hosted similar vehicles on the radio\u2014and was a familiar celebrity guest on various other broadcast programs, including the long-running NBC Radio Monitor Beacon as a commentator dubbed \"An expert of nothing with opinions on everything\", ''[[Monitor (NBC radio)|Monitor]]''.\n\nHis frequent appearances on NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' spanned three emcees ([[Steve Allen]], [[Jack Paar]], and [[Johnny Carson]]), from the 1950s to the 1970s. One memorable story, as recounted to Johnny Carson, was about his meeting with then-President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. As Capp was ushered into the [[Oval Office]], his [[Prosthesis|prosthetic leg]] suddenly collapsed into a pile of disengaged parts and hinges on the floor. The President immediately turned to an aide and said, \"Call [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed]] (Hospital), or maybe [[National Naval Medical Center|Bethesda]],\" to which Capp replied, \"Hell no, just call a good local mechanic!\" (Capp also spoofed Carson in his strip, in a 1970 episode called \"The Tommy Wholesome Show\".)\n\nCapp portrayed himself in a cameo role in the [[Bob Hope]] film ''That Certain Feeling'', for which he also provided promotional art. He was interviewed live on ''[[Person to Person]]'' on November 27, 1959, by host [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]]. He also appeared as himself on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', [[Sid Caesar]]'s ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'', ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', and guested on [[Ralph Edwards]]' ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' on February 12, 1961, with honoree Peter Palmer. Capp also freelanced very successfully as a magazine writer and newspaper columnist, in a wide variety of publications including ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'', ''Show'', ''Pageant'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''Coronet'', and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Capp was impersonated by comedians [[Rich Little]] and [[David Frye]]. Although Capp's endorsement activities never rivaled Li'l Abner's or Fearless Fosdick's, he was a celebrity spokesman in print ads for Sheaffer Snorkel fountain pens (along with colleagues and close friends [[Milton Caniff]] and Walt Kelly), and\u2014with an irony that would become apparent later\u2014a brand of cigarettes, ([[Chesterfield cigarettes|Chesterfield]]).\n\nCapp resumed visiting war amputees during the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]]. He toured Vietnam with the [[USO]], entertaining troops along with [[Art Buchwald]] and [[George Plimpton]]. He served as chairman of the Cartoonists' Committee in President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s People-to-People program in 1954 (although Capp had supported [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] for president in 1952 and 1956),<ref>[http://www.reuben.org/ncs/members/memorium/capp.jpg Al Capp's biography card from the National Cartoonists Society]</ref> which was organized to promote [[Savings bond]]s for the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]]. Capp had earlier provided the Shmoo for a special Children's Savings Bond in 1949, accompanying President [[Harry S. Truman]] at the bond's unveiling ceremony.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/\"Presarvin' Freedom: Al Capp, Treasury Man,\" ''Hogan's Alley Online Magazine'', 9 May 2012]</ref> During the [[Soviet Union]]'s blockade of [[West Berlin]] in 1948, the commanders of the Berlin airlift had cabled Capp, requesting inflatable shmoos as part of \"Operation: Little Vittles\". Candy-filled shmoos were air-dropped to hungry West Berliners by America's 17th Military Airport Squadron during the [[humanitarian]] effort. \"When the candy-chocked shmoos were dropped, a near-riot resulted,\" (reported in ''[[Newsweek]]''\u2014October 11, 1948).\n\nIn addition to his public service work for charitable organizations for the handicapped, Capp also served on the National Reading Council, which was organized to combat illiteracy. He published a column (\"Wrong Turn Onto Sesame Street\") challenging federally funded [[public television]] endowments in favor of educational comics\u2014which, according to Capp, \"didn't cost a dime in taxes and never had. I pointed out that a kid could enjoy ''[[Sesame Street]]'' ''without'' learning how to read, but he couldn't enjoy comic strips ''unless'' he could read; and that a smaller investment in getting kids to read by supplying them with educational matter in such ''reading'' form might make better sense.\"\n\nCapp's academic interests included being one of nineteen original \"Trustees and Advisors\" for \"Endicott, Junior College for Young Woman\", located in Pride's Crossing (Beverly), Massachusetts, which was founded in 1939. Al Capp is listed in the 1942 Mingotide Yearbook, representing the first graduating class from Endicott Junior College. The yearbook entry includes his credential as a \"Cartoonist for United Feature Syndicate\" and a resident of New York City.\n\n\"Comics,\" wrote Capp in 1970, \"can be a combination of the highest quality of art and text, and many of them are.\" Capp would produce many giveaway educational comic books and [[public services]] pamphlets, spanning several decades, for the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]], the [[United States civil defense|Department of Civil Defense]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]], the [[U.S. Army]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]] (a forerunner of [[United Way of America|United Way]]), and the [[Job Corps]]. Capp's studio provided special artwork for various civic groups and [[nonprofit organizations]] as well. Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the Cancer Foundation, the [[March of Dimes]], the National Heart Fund, the [[Boy Scouts of America]], Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, the National Amputation Foundation, and [[Disabled American Veterans]], among others.<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/> They were also used to help sell [[Christmas Seals]].\n\nIn the early 1960s, Capp regularly wrote a column entitled ''Al Capp's Column'' for the newspaper ''The Schenectady Gazette'' (currently ''[[The Daily Gazette]]''). He was the ''[[Playboy]]'' interview subject in December 1965, in a conversation conducted by [[Alvin Toffler]]. In August 1967, Capp was the narrator and host of an ABC network special called ''Do Blondes Have More Fun?''. In 1970, he was the subject of a provocative NBC documentary called ''This Is Al Capp''.\n\n==The 1960s and 1970s==\nCapp and his family lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], near [[Harvard]] during the entire Vietnam War protest era. The turmoil that Americans were watching on their television sets was happening live\u2014right in his own neighborhood. Campus [[Far left|radicals]] and \"[[hippies]]\" inevitably became one of Capp's favorite targets in the sixties. Alongside his long-established caricatures of right-wing, big business types such as General Bullmoose and J. Roaringham Fatback, Capp began spoofing [[counterculture]] icons such as [[Joan Baez]] (in the character of Joanie Phoanie, a wealthy folksinger who offers an impoverished orphanage ten thousand dollars' worth of \"protest songs\").<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843312,00.html Which One Is the Phoanie? - Time]</ref> The sequence implicitly labeled Baez a [[limousine liberal]], a charge she took to heart, as detailed years later in her 1987 autobiography, ''And A Voice To Sing With: A Memoir''. Another target was Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], parodied as \"Senator O. Noble McGesture\", resident of \"Hyideelsport\". The town name is a play on [[Hyannisport, Massachusetts]], where a number of the Kennedy clan have lived.\n\nCapp became a popular public speaker on college campuses, where he reportedly relished hecklers. He attacked militant antiwar demonstrators, both in his personal appearances and in his strip. He also satirized student political groups. The [[Youth International Party]] (YIP) and [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) emerged in ''Li'l Abner'' as \"Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything!\" (SWINE). In an April 1969 letter to ''Time'', Capp insisted, \"The students I blast are not the dissenters, but the destroyers\u2014the less than 4% who lock up deans in washrooms, who burn manuscripts of unpublished books, who make combination pigpens and playpens of their universities. The remaining 96% detest them as heartily as I do.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844734-3,00.html Letters page April 18, 1969 - TIME]</ref>\n\nCapp's increasingly controversial remarks at his campus speeches and during television appearances cost him his semi-regular spot on the ''Tonight Show''. His contentious public persona during this period was captured on a late sixties comedy LP called ''Al Capp On Campus''. The album features his interaction with students at Fresno State College (now [[California State University, Fresno]]) on such topics as \"sensitivity training,\" \"humanitarianism,\" \"abstract art\" (Capp hated it), and \"student protest\". The cover features a cartoon drawing by Capp of wildly dressed, angry hippies carrying protest signs with slogans like \"End Capp Brutality\", \"Abner and Daisy Mae Smoke Pot\", \"Capp Is Over [30, 40, 50\u2014all crossed out] the Hill!!\", and \"If You Like Crap, You'll Like Capp!\"\n\nHighlights of the strip's final decades include \"Boomchik\" (1961), in which America's international prestige is saved by Mammy Yokum, \"Daisy Mae Steps Out\" (1966), a female-empowering tale of Daisy's brazenly audacious \"homewrecker gland\", \"The Lips of Marcia Perkins\" (1967), a satirical, thinly-veiled commentary on [[venereal disease]] and public health warnings, \"Ignoble Savages\" (1968), in which [[Mafia|the Mob]] takes over Harvard, and \"Corporal Crock\" (1973), in which Bullmoose reveals his reactionary cartoon role model, in a tale of obsession and the fanatical world of comic book collecting.\n\nThe cartoonist visited [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] at their 1969 [[Bed-In for Peace]] in [[Montreal]], and their testy exchange later appeared in the documentary film ''[[Imagine: John Lennon]]'' (1988). Introducing himself with the words \"I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist. How do you do?,\" Capp sardonically congratulated Lennon and Ono on their ''[[Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins|Two Virgins]]'' nude album cover: \"I think that everybody owes it to the world to prove they have pubic hair. You've done it, and I tell you that I applaud you for it.\" Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono (\"Good God, you've gotta live with that?\"), and was asked to \"get out\" by [[Derek Taylor]]. Lennon allowed him to stay, however, but the conversation had soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his ''[[Ballad of John and Yoko]]'' song with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: \"Christ, you know it ain't easy / You know how hard it can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify ''Capp!'' \"<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/i/imagine-john-lennon-script-transcript.html Imagine: John Lennon Script - transcript from the screenplay and/or documentary movie about John Lennon]</ref>\n\nDespite his political conservatism in the last decade of his life, Capp is reported to have been liberal in some particular causes; he supported [[gay rights]], and did not tolerate any attempts at homophobic jokes.<ref name=\"printmag.com\"/> He is also said to have supported [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the fight for racial equality in American society, although he was very sceptical of the tactics of [[Black Panthers]] and [[Malcolm X]].<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary (2013) Bloomsbury Publishing, p. 196</ref>\n\nIn 1968, a [[theme park]] called [[Dogpatch USA]] opened at Marble Falls, [[Arkansas]], based on Capp's work and with his support. The park was a popular attraction during the 1970s, but was abandoned in 1993 due to financial difficulties. By 2005, the area once devoted to a live-action facsimile of Dogpatch (including a lifesize statue in the town square of Dogpatch \"founder\" General Jubilation T. Cornpone) had been heavily stripped by vandals and souvenir hunters, and was slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding Arkansas wilderness.\n\nOn April 22, 1971, syndicated [[columnist]] Jack Anderson reported allegations that Capp made indecent advances to four female students when he was invited to speak at the [[University of Alabama]] in February 1968. Anderson and an associate confirmed that Capp was shown out of town by university police, but that the incident had been hushed up by the university to avoid negative publicity.<ref>[[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Anderson, Jack]], \"Washington Merry-Go-Round,\" April 22, 1971</ref>\n\nThe following month, Capp was charged in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]], in connection with another alleged incident following his April 1 lecture at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire|University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire]].<ref>\"Al Capp Accused on Moral Counts at Eau Claire U.\"; ''[[The Capital Times]]'', May 7, 1971</ref> Capp was accused of propositioning a married woman in his hotel room. Although no sexual act was alleged to have resulted, the original charge included [[Sodomy laws in the United States|\"sodomy\"]]. As part of a plea agreement, Capp pleaded guilty to the charge of \"attempted adultery\" (adultery was a felony in Wisconsin <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vanwagnerwood.com/CM/Custom/Adultery.asp |title= Adultery is a crime in Wisconsin {{!}} Law Offices of criminal defense attorneys Christopher Van Wagner and Tracey Wood, Madison WI |access-date= 2008-06-30 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516092007/http://www.vanwagnerwood.com/CM/Custom/Adultery.asp |archive-date= 2008-05-16 |url-status= dead }}</ref>) and the other charges were dropped. Capp was fined $500 and court costs.<ref>\"Al Capp Admits One Morals Count; Pays $500 Fine\"; ''[[The Capital Times]],'' February 12, 1972</ref> In a December 1992 article for ''[[The New Yorker]],'' [[Seymour Hersh]] reported that President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Charles Colson]] had repeatedly discussed the Capp case in Oval Office recordings that had recently been made available by the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]. Nixon and Capp were on friendly terms, Hersh wrote, and Nixon and Colson had worked to find a way for Capp to run against [[Ted Kennedy]] for the U.S. Senate. \"Nixon was worried about the allegations, fearing that Capp's very close links to the White House would become embarrassingly public\", Hersh wrote. \"The White House tapes and documents show that he and Colson discussed the issue repeatedly, and that Colson eventually reassured the president by saying that he had, in essence, fixed the case. Specifically, the president was told that one of Colson's people had gone to Wisconsin and tried to talk to the prosecutors.\" Colson's efforts failed, however. The Eau Claire district attorney, a Republican, refused to dismiss the attempted adultery charge.<ref>[[Seymour Hersh|Hersh, Seymour]], \"Nixon's Last Cover-Up: The Tapes He Wants the Archives to Suppress\"; ''[[The New Yorker]]'', December 14, 1992, pp. 80\u201381</ref> In passing sentence in February 1972, the judge rejected the D.A.'s motion that Capp agree to undergo psychiatric treatment.\n\nThe resulting publicity led to hundreds of papers dropping his comic strip,<ref name=\"salon\">[http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/09/30/capp/index.html?pn= Dogpatch confidential - Salon.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304230031/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/09/30/capp/index.html?pn= |date=2008-03-04}}</ref> and Capp, already in failing health, withdrew from public speaking. [[Celebrity biographer]] James Spada has claimed that similar allegations were made by actress [[Grace Kelly]]. However, no firsthand allegation has ever surfaced.<ref>Spada, James, ''Grace: The Secret Lives of a Princess''. Garden City, NY: Doubleday & Company, 1987, p.37</ref>\n\n\"From beginning to end, Capp was acid-tongued toward the targets of his wit, intolerant of hypocrisy, and always wickedly funny. After about 40 years, however, Capp's interest in ''Abner'' waned, and this showed in the strip itself,\" according to [[Don Markstein]]'s ''[[Toonopedia]]''. On November 13, 1977, Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the recently declining quality of the strip, which he said had been the best he could manage due to declining health. \"If you have any sense of humor about your strip\u2014and I had a sense of humor about mine\u2014you knew that for three or four years ''Abner'' was wrong. Oh hell, it's like a fighter retiring. I stayed on longer than I should have,\" he admitted,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948819,00.html Mr. Dogpatch - 1979 TIME obituary]</ref> adding that he couldn't breathe anymore. \"When he retired ''Li'l Abner'', newspapers ran expansive articles and television commentators talked about the passing of an era. ''[[People magazine]]'' ran a substantial feature, and even the comics-free ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' devoted nearly a full page to the event\", wrote publisher [[Denis Kitchen]].\n\nCapp's final years were marked by advancing illness and by family tragedy. In October 1977, one of his two daughters died; a few weeks later, a beloved granddaughter was killed in a car accident. A lifelong chain smoker, Capp died in 1979 from [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]] at his home in [[South Hampton, New Hampshire]].<ref>[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x546276190/Al-Capp-was-here Al Capp Was Here ''Newburyport Daily News'' Sept. 27, 2009]</ref> Capp is buried in Mount Prospect Cemetery in Amesbury, Massachusetts. Engraved on his headstone is a stanza from [[Thomas Gray]]: ''The plowman homeward plods his weary way / And leaves the world to darkness and to me'' (from ''[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]'', 1751).\n\n==Legacy==\n\"Neither the strip's shifting political leanings nor the slide of its final few years had any bearing on its status as a classic; and in 1995, it was recognized as such by the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]]\", according to ''Toonopedia''. ''Li'l Abner'' was one of 20 American comic strips included in the [[Comic Strip Classics]] series of USPS [[commemorative stamp]]s. Al Capp, an inductee into the [[National Cartoon Museum]] (formerly the International Museum of Cartoon Art), is one of only 31 artists selected to their [[Hall of Fame]]. Capp was also inducted into the [[Will Eisner Award]] Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\n[[Sadie Hawkins Day]] and [[:wikt:double whammy|double whammy]] are two terms attributed to Al Capp that have entered the English language. Other, less ubiquitous Cappisms include [[skunk works]] and [[Lower Slobbovia]]. The term [[shmoo]] also has entered the [[lexicon]], defining highly technical concepts in no fewer than ''four'' separate fields of science, including the variations [[Mating of yeast|shmooing]] (a [[microbiological]] term for the \"budding\" process in yeast reproduction), and [[shmoo plot]] (a technical term in the field of [[electrical engineering]]). In [[socioeconomics]], a \"shmoo\" refers to any generic kind of good that reproduces itself, (as opposed to \"[[widget (economics)|widget]]s\" which require resources and active production). In the field of [[particle physics]], \"shmoo\" refers to a high energy survey instrument, as used at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] to capture subatomic [[cosmic ray]] particles emitted from the [[Cygnus X-3]] [[constellation]]. Capp also had a knack for popularizing certain uncommon terms, such as [[List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom|druthers]], [[schmooze]], and [[-nik|nogoodnik, neatnik, etc.]] In his book ''[[The American Language]]'', [[H.L. Mencken]] credits the postwar mania for adding \"-nik\" to the ends of adjectives to create nouns as beginning\u2014not with [[beatnik]] or [[Sputnik]]\u2014but earlier, in the pages of ''Li'l Abner''.\n\nAl Capp's life and career are the subjects of a new life-sized [[mural]] commemorating the 100th anniversary of his birth. Created by resident artist [[Jon P. Mooers]], the mural was unveiled in downtown [[Amesbury, Massachusetts|Amesbury]] on May 15, 2010.<ref>[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x1612544031/Town-to-honor-famous-cartoonist-who-lived-worked-in-Amesbury#comment-45683673 Town to Honor Famous Cartoonist Who Lived, Worked in Amesbury ''Newburyport Daily News'' April 20, 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2010/05/15/amesbury_gives_lil_abner_his_due/?page=full Amesbury Gives Li'l Abner His Due ''Boston Globe'' May 15, 2010]</ref> According to the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' (as reported on May 18, 2010), the town has renamed its amphitheater in the artist's honor, and is looking to develop an Al Capp Museum. Capp is also the subject of an upcoming [[WNET-TV]] ''[[American Masters]]'' [[documentary]], ''The Life and Times of Al Capp'', produced by his granddaughter, independent filmmaker Caitlin Manning.\n\nSince his death in 1979, Al Capp and his work have been the subject of more than 40 books, including three biographies. [[Underground comix|Underground cartoonist]] and ''Li'l Abner'' expert [[Denis Kitchen]] has published, co-published, edited, or otherwise served as consultant on nearly all of them.

This natural process is caused by the dynamic activity of erosive agents, that is, water, ice (glaciers), snow, air (wind), plants, animals, and humans.

Excessive (or accelerated) erosion causes both \"on-site\" and \"off-site\" problems. On-site impacts include decreases in [[agricultural productivity]] and (on [[natural landscape]]s) [[ecological collapse]], both because of loss of the nutrient-rich upper [[soil horizon|soil layers]]. In some cases, the eventual end result is [[desertification]]. Off-site effects include [[Sediment#Erosion and agricultural sediment delivery to rivers|sedimentation of waterways]] and [[eutrophication]] of water bodies, as well as sediment-related damage to roads and houses.

Valley erosion is occurring due to the flow of the stream, and the boulders and stones (and much of the soil) that are lying on the edges are [[glacial till]] that was left behind as ice age glaciers flowed over the terrain.]]\n''Valley'' or ''stream erosion'' occurs with continued water flow along a linear feature. The erosion is both [[Downcutting|downward]], deepening the valley, and [[headward erosion|headward]], extending the valley into the hillside, creating [[Head Cut (stream geomorphology)|head cuts]] and steep banks. In the earliest stage of stream erosion, the erosive activity is dominantly vertical, the valleys have a typical '''V''' cross-section and the stream gradient is relatively steep. When some [[base level]] is reached, the erosive activity switches to lateral erosion, which widens the valley floor and creates a narrow floodplain. The stream gradient becomes nearly flat, and lateral deposition of sediments becomes important as the stream [[meander]]s across the valley floor. In all stages of stream erosion, by far the most erosion occurs during times of flood, when more and faster-moving water is available to carry a larger sediment load. In such processes, it is not the water alone that erodes: suspended abrasive particles, [[pebble]]s and [[boulder]]s can also act erosively as they traverse a [[Erosion surface|surface]], in a process known as ''traction''.<ref>Ritter, Michael E.

The relationship is particularly strong if heavy rainfall occurs at times when, or in locations where, the soil's surface is not well protected by [[vegetation]]. This might be during periods when [[agriculture|agricultural activities]] leave the soil bare, or in [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] regions where vegetation is naturally sparse. Wind erosion requires strong winds, particularly during times of drought when vegetation is sparse and soil is dry (and so is more erodible). Other climatic factors such as average temperature and temperature range may also affect erosion, via their effects on vegetation and soil properties. In general, given similar vegetation and ecosystems, areas with more precipitation (especially high-intensity rainfall), more wind, or more storms are expected to have more erosion.\n\nIn some areas of the world (e.g. the [[Midwestern United States|mid-western USA]]), rainfall intensity is the primary determinant of erosivity, with higher intensity rainfall generally resulting in more soil erosion by water. The size and velocity of [[rain drop]]s is also an important factor. Larger and higher-velocity rain drops have greater [[kinetic energy]], and thus their impact will displace soil particles by larger distances than smaller, slower-moving rain drops.<ref>{{cite book|author=Blanco, Humberto|author2=Lal, Rattan|last-author-amp=yes|chapter=Water erosion|title=Principles of Soil Conservation and Management|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-8529-0|pages=29\u201331|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj3690PbDY0C&pg=PA29}}</ref>\n\nIn other regions of the world (e.g. [[Western europe|western Europe]]), runoff and erosion result from relatively low intensities of [[Precipitation types#Stratiform|stratiform rainfall]] falling onto previously saturated soil. In such situations, rainfall amount rather than intensity is the main factor determining the severity of soil erosion by water.<ref>Boardman, John & Poesen, Jean. Soil Erosion in Europe.

Thus, if rainfall amounts and intensities increase in many parts of the world as expected, erosion will also increase, unless amelioration measures are taken. Soil erosion rates are expected to change in response to changes in climate for a variety of reasons. The most direct is the change in the erosive power of rainfall. Other reasons include: a) changes in plant canopy caused by shifts in plant biomass production associated with moisture regime; b) changes in litter cover on the ground caused by changes in both plant residue decomposition rates driven by temperature and moisture dependent soil microbial activity as well as plant biomass production rates; c) changes in soil moisture due to shifting precipitation regimes and evapo-transpiration rates, which changes infiltration and runoff ratios; d) soil [[erodibility]] changes due to decrease in [[soil organic matter]] concentrations in soils that lead to a soil structure that is more susceptible to erosion and increased runoff due to increased soil surface sealing and crusting; e) a shift of winter precipitation from non-erosive snow to erosive rainfall due to increasing winter temperatures; f) melting of permafrost, which induces an erodible soil state from a previously non-erodible one; and g) shifts in land use made necessary to accommodate new climatic regimes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nStudies by Pruski and Nearing indicated that, other factors such as land use unconsidered, it is reasonable to expect approximately a 1.7% change in soil erosion for each 1% change in total precipitation under climate change.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pruski |first=F.

The erosion is both [[Downcutting|downward]], deepening the valley, and [[headward erosion|headward]], extending the valley into the hillside, creating [[Head Cut (stream geomorphology)|head cuts]] and steep banks. In the earliest stage of stream erosion, the erosive activity is dominantly vertical, the valleys have a typical '''V''' cross-section and the stream gradient is relatively steep. When some [[base level]] is reached, the erosive activity switches to lateral erosion, which widens the valley floor and creates a narrow floodplain. The stream gradient becomes nearly flat, and lateral deposition of sediments becomes important as the stream [[meander]]s across the valley floor. In all stages of stream erosion, by far the most erosion occurs during times of flood, when more and faster-moving water is available to carry a larger sediment load. In such processes, it is not the water alone that erodes: suspended abrasive particles, [[pebble]]s and [[boulder]]s can also act erosively as they traverse a [[Erosion surface|surface]], in a process known as ''traction''.<ref>Ritter, Michael E.

The relationship is particularly strong if heavy rainfall occurs at times when, or in locations where, the soil's surface is not well protected by [[vegetation]]. This might be during periods when [[agriculture|agricultural activities]] leave the soil bare, or in [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] regions where vegetation is naturally sparse. Wind erosion requires strong winds, particularly during times of drought when vegetation is sparse and soil is dry (and so is more erodible). Other climatic factors such as average temperature and temperature range may also affect erosion, via their effects on vegetation and soil properties. In general, given similar vegetation and ecosystems, areas with more precipitation (especially high-intensity rainfall), more wind, or more storms are expected to have more erosion.\n\nIn some areas of the world (e.g. the [[Midwestern United States|mid-western USA]]), rainfall intensity is the primary determinant of erosivity, with higher intensity rainfall generally resulting in more soil erosion by water. The size and velocity of [[rain drop]]s is also an important factor. Larger and higher-velocity rain drops have greater [[kinetic energy]], and thus their impact will displace soil particles by larger distances than smaller, slower-moving rain drops.<ref>{{cite book|author=Blanco, Humberto|author2=Lal, Rattan|last-author-amp=yes|chapter=Water erosion|title=Principles of Soil Conservation and Management|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-8529-0|pages=29\u201331|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj3690PbDY0C&pg=PA29}}</ref>\n\nIn other regions of the world (e.g. [[Western europe|western Europe]]), runoff and erosion result from relatively low intensities of [[Precipitation types#Stratiform|stratiform rainfall]] falling onto previously saturated soil. In such situations, rainfall amount rather than intensity is the main factor determining the severity of soil erosion by water.<ref>Boardman, John & Poesen, Jean. Soil Erosion in Europe.

Thus, if rainfall amounts and intensities increase in many parts of the world as expected, erosion will also increase, unless amelioration measures are taken. Soil erosion rates are expected to change in response to changes in climate for a variety of reasons. The most direct is the change in the erosive power of rainfall. Other reasons include: a) changes in plant canopy caused by shifts in plant biomass production associated with moisture regime; b) changes in litter cover on the ground caused by changes in both plant residue decomposition rates driven by temperature and moisture dependent soil microbial activity as well as plant biomass production rates; c) changes in soil moisture due to shifting precipitation regimes and evapo-transpiration rates, which changes infiltration and runoff ratios; d) soil [[erodibility]] changes due to decrease in [[soil organic matter]] concentrations in soils that lead to a soil structure that is more susceptible to erosion and increased runoff due to increased soil surface sealing and crusting; e) a shift of winter precipitation from non-erosive snow to erosive rainfall due to increasing winter temperatures; f) melting of permafrost, which induces an erodible soil state from a previously non-erodible one; and g) shifts in land use made necessary to accommodate new climatic regimes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nStudies by Pruski and Nearing indicated that, other factors such as land use unconsidered, it is reasonable to expect approximately a 1.7% change in soil erosion for each 1% change in total precipitation under climate change.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pruski |first=F.

Gresley play in the {{English football updater|Gresley}}, playing their home games at the Moat Ground. They were known as '''Gresley Rovers''' until 2009, when they were reformed under their current name.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nGresley Rovers were formed in 1882 in the small mining village of Church Gresley, near to Swadlincote, Derbyshire. The club's first ground was at Mushroom Lane in [[Albert Village]] a mile or so from Church Gresley. Gresley played only [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] and cup games before joining the Burton Junior League for the 1892\u201393 season, winning their first title in 1894\u201395. Rovers acquired a new home, the Church Street Ground, in time for the 1895\u201396 season. Despite the ground's lack of facilities (the teams changed at the nearby Boot Hotel) the club were accepted into the [[Midland League]] for the 1903\u201304 season where they struggled for three seasons, to the local league in 1905. At the end of the 1907\u201308 season the Church Street Ground was required for building, so the club moved across the road onto the newly acquired Moat Ground, where Gresley continue to play to the present.\n\n===Moving up===\nRovers stepped up a couple of grades to join the Central Alliance and then moved up again as they joined the powerful [[Birmingham Combination]] in 1925. However, despite reaching the First Round Proper of the [[FA Cup]] in 1930\u201331, they experienced financial difficulties and these forced them to leave the Birmingham Combination and join the more local Central Alliance in 1933.\n\nA couple of seasons later they moved to the [[Leicestershire Senior League]] and enjoyed success in the immediate post-war years as they won the title in 1946\u201347 and 1947\u201348 and were runners-up in 1948\u201349. At the start of the '50s the club made the decision to join the Central Alliance. However, on this occasion, their stay in that League was only brief and they joined the Birmingham & District League in 1954\u201355. They then rejoined the Central Alliance in 1959\u201360 and stayed in that League until 1974\u201375 during which time the League changed its title to the East Midlands Regional League.\n\n===Glory years===\nGresley dominated that League and in the fourteen seasons from 1961 to 1975 the lowest they finished was in fifth place as they won the title on four occasions, finished runners-up on four occasions, ended in third place on three occasions, fourth on two occasions and fifth only once. At the start of the 1975\u201376, they moved to the [[West Midlands (Regional) League]], which was a much stronger League, and in the early years they always ended in the lower regions of the table. However, after much hard work off the field, runners-up spot was achieved in 1985\u201386 and the following six seasons saw Gresley finish 4th, 4th, 2nd, 3rd, 1st and 1st. During that period they also won the [[Derbyshire Senior Cup]] on four successive occasions. Season 1990\u201391 was a particularly good one for Gresley\n\n===FA Vase finalists===\nIn addition to the league title and the Derbyshire Senior Cup win they also reached the final of the [[FA Vase]] and so had the honour of playing at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. Their opponents were Guiseley and some national newspapers reported it as 'the most exciting Wembley Cup Final ever'. When one looks at the goals' sequence one can see how the game earned that accolade: After 31 minutes the score was [[Guiseley F.C.|Guiseley]] 3\u20130 Gresley, but Gresley came back and grabbed a very dramatic equaliser in injury time at the end of the ninety minutes. Then in extra time Gresley went 4\u20133 in front but this time Guiseley scored a very dramatic equaliser as they levelled things in injury time at the end of the second half of extra time.\n\nThe replay at [[Bramall Lane]] saw Gresley lose by 3\u20131. However, despite that tremendous season their application to join the Southern League was not successful but they battled on to win the league again the following season. This time their application to the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] was successful and they were placed in the Midland Division for the 1992\u201393 season.\n\n===Disappointment and success===\nThat 1993\u201394 season had some disappointment for Gresley as they lost in the semi-final of the FA Vase and so narrowly missed another trip to [[Wembley]], but in the League they confounded everyone by finishing as runners-up and so gained promotion to the Premier Division at the first attempt. The 1993\u201394 season saw them consolidate in 14th position but medals did come to the club as they again won the [[Derbyshire]] Senior Cup and reached the Final of the Southern League Cup. An improved League position of 8th was achieved in 1994\u201395 and that season saw them reaching the First Round Proper of the [[FA Cup]] for only the second time ever before losing away to [[Crewe]].\n\n[[Paul Futcher]] was appointed manager with [[Garry Birtles]], the former England International, his assistant on 2 November 1995. Rovers improved their League position yet again in 1995\u201396 as they ended the season in 5th place and had the bonus of winning the [[Derbyshire Senior Cup]] yet again.\n\nThe season 1996\u201397 was the best in the club's long history because in addition to retaining the Derbyshire Senior Cup they also won the Southern League Premier Division championship. Rovers were unbeaten in their first seventeen league games (won 10 drawn 7) and were league leaders for 31 weeks.\n\nThe title was finally won with a 3\u20131 home victory against [[Gloucester City A.F.C.|Gloucester City]] at the Moat Ground on 26 April 1997. Gresley Rovers became the first [[Derbyshire]] side and first village side to win this prestigious trophy but ground grading meant that they were unable to gain promotion to the [[Football Conference]]. The game was also notable for serious crowd disorder between the two sets of fans after Gresley's opening goal which led to the game being delayed for 25 minutes as fighting spilled onto the pitch. Derby County were willing to lend Gresley their recently vacated [[Baseball Ground]] until the required standards could be met but this was rejected by the footballing authorities.\n\nPaul Futcher the Manager during that campaign left during the close season and his Assistant Manager Garry Birtles stepped up into the Manager's position. The disappointment of not being promoted to the Football Conference saw many of Gresley's players leave the club. The 1997\u201398 season saw Gresley finish in the bottom half of the Southern League Premier Division.\n\n===Relegation===\n[[Image:Elvis gresley.jpg|thumb|right|Elvis Gresley, the club's mascot]]\nThe 1998\u201399 season will go down in the history of Gresley Rovers as one of the worst. At the end of 1998 they were in the top six. By the end of April they were relegated. The season started well and 13 points from their September games saw them in third place just four points adrift of the leaders [[Nuneaton Borough F.C.|Nuneaton Borough]]. In November Gresley Rovers were drawn to meet [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] at the [[Bescot Stadium]] in the first round of the FA Cup. Gresley went close to causing an upset but were denied at least a replay by a goal 11 minutes from the end. Victories over [[King's Lynn F.C.|King's Lynn]] and [[Hastings Town F.C.|Hastings Town]] got December off to a fine start; however, three defeats saw them drop to 6th place. After a disastrous run of 6 successive defeats in January saw them slump to 17th place just 5 points above the relegation places. In February two successive draws and three defeats proved to be Garry Birtles downfall and he and his assistant, [[Paul Fitzpatrick]] were dismissed. [[Stuart Ford]] took charge temporarily and saw the team beat [[Atherstone Town F.C.|Atherstone United]] 2\u20131 that ended a run of 14 games without a win. In March 1999 [[Brian Kenning]] was appointed manager. The opening game of April produced a comfortable 3\u20130 victory over [[Cambridge City F.C.|Cambridge City]]. But three defeats followed against Nuneaton Borough, [[Crawley Town F.C.|Crawley Town]] and [[Rothwell Town F.C.|Rothwell Town]]. Vital game at [[Dorchester Town F.C.|Dorchester Town]] and [[Salisbury City F.C.|Salisbury City]] yielded only one point. The defeat on the final day against [[Bath City F.C.|Bath City]] pushed Gresley into the Midlands Division just two years after winning the Southern League Premier Division Championship by 11 points. The last time Gresley were relegated was in the 1958\u201359 season when they went down from the Birmingham League Division one to Division two.\n\n===Reformation===\nAfter financial difficulties, Gresley Rovers liquidated at the end of the 2008\u201309 season, forming a new football club, Gresley F.C. In the 2009\u201310 season, they were placed in the [[East Midlands Counties Football League|East Midlands Counties League]]. After finishing their first season in second place they went one better by winning it in 2010\u201311. The following season they also won the Midland Football Alliance earning a place at Step 4 of the pyramid.\n\nIn the 2013\u201314 season Gresley finished 9th in the [[Northern Premier League Division One South]]. In the following season Gresley F.C. achieved their biggest ever league win 10\u20130 at home to [[Brigg Town F.C.|Brigg Town]] on 13 September 2014. However, a week later manager Martin Rowe resigned due to personal reasons. After a successful Caretaker Manager reign, Wayne Thornhill took charge with hopes to reach the play-offs by the end of the season. The 2014\u201315 season also saw Gresley go on their best Derbyshire Senior Cup run since reformation, finishing runners up and knocking out holders [[Ilkeston F.C.|Ilkeston]]. The Moatmen reached the play-off semi finals in 2014-15 but lost narrowly away to [[Leek Town F.C.|Leek Town]].\n\nIn pre-season the Moatmen lost key players Mitch Hanson and Kieran O'Connell to long-term injuries and a number of influential players left the club including Eric Graves. After a tough start to the 2015-16 campaign. Wayne Thornhill resigned on 22 September 2015. Dave Langston enjoyed a successful interim campaign but could not take on the job full-time due to work commitments. His interim spell lasted until 17 October when Scott Goodwin took charge. Scott Goodwin achieved one win and six losses in his short tenure at the club and was relieved of his duties on 5 December 2015. Between the 28 November and 26 January, the Moatmen had no home league games due to numerous postponements. Gary Ricketts immediately took over as Player/Manager with Dave Langston appointed as assistant. His tenure started in promising fashion, with a victory over [[Mickleover Sports F.C.|Mickleover Sports]] booking the Moatmen a semi-final berth in the Derbyshire Senior Cup and five straight home NPL Division One victories - their best run of the season - giving them faint hopes of a play-off push. Gresley had a thin squad due to the loss of income the postponements brought and were also playing twice a week most weeks from February to the end of the season. A lot of the re-arranged home games were on Tuesday nights meaning attendances fell but this was also due to poor form. A run of nine straight losses came in March, as injuries, suspensions and availability issues - as well as some below-par displays - took their toll, Gresley eventually ending the season in 16th place. On the 23rd May 2016 Gary Ricketts resigned due to personal reasons and Dave Langston left the club to become manager of [[Lichfield City F.C.|Lichfield City]].\n\nFor the 2016\u201317 season the main stand was renamed after Pat Murray, a local councillor, as he agreed to donate \u00a31,500 to the club. Pre-season saw the departure of the two best performing 2015-16 players as voted by supporters. Supporters player of the year runner up Jack Langston and the Supporters' ''player-of-the-year'' John Guy both moved to [[Belper Town F.C.|Belper Town]] to join up with former Moatmen Eric Graves, Alex Steadman, Jordan Ball, Kyle Bryant, Luke Edwards and Bradley Wells. On 10 June 2016, Gresley appointed, former St. Kitts and Nevis international, Damion Beckford-Quailey as their new manager. Damion named Hannah Dingley as his assistant manager and [[Brian Quailey]] and Chris Cowan as coaches. Further players departed the club including highly rated teenager Ryan King. The 2016/17 season began strong with 16 points from the first 8 games. However, only five wins followed from the next 32 games which lead to influential forwards Pearson Mwanyongo and Tendai Chitiza leaving the club. Damion's side went on a good run in the Derbyshire Senior Cup reaching the final. However, Gresley finished the season in 18th place.\n\nThe following pre-season saw star forward Reece Morris leave the club after picking up 4 awards for the 2016\u201317 season. The 2017\u201318 season was one to forget for Gresley supporters. Gresley featured towards the bottom of the table all season but they retained their place in the [[Northern Premier League Division One South]] with 4 games remaining. The following week saw the Chairman, Vice Chairman and manager all step down with most of the first team squad leaving with 3 matches still to play.\n\n==Stadium==\nThe club has played at the '''Moat Ground''' since 1909.

Gresley play in the {{English football updater|Gresley}}, playing their home games at the Moat Ground. They were known as '''Gresley Rovers''' until 2009, when they were reformed under their current name.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nGresley Rovers were formed in 1882 in the small mining village of Church Gresley, near to Swadlincote, Derbyshire. The club's first ground was at Mushroom Lane in [[Albert Village]] a mile or so from Church Gresley. Gresley played only [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] and cup games before joining the Burton Junior League for the 1892\u201393 season, winning their first title in 1894\u201395. Rovers acquired a new home, the Church Street Ground, in time for the 1895\u201396 season. Despite the ground's lack of facilities (the teams changed at the nearby Boot Hotel) the club were accepted into the [[Midland League]] for the 1903\u201304 season where they struggled for three seasons, to the local league in 1905. At the end of the 1907\u201308 season the Church Street Ground was required for building, so the club moved across the road onto the newly acquired Moat Ground, where Gresley continue to play to the present.\n\n===Moving up===\nRovers stepped up a couple of grades to join the Central Alliance and then moved up again as they joined the powerful [[Birmingham Combination]] in 1925. However, despite reaching the First Round Proper of the [[FA Cup]] in 1930\u201331, they experienced financial difficulties and these forced them to leave the Birmingham Combination and join the more local Central Alliance in 1933.\n\nA couple of seasons later they moved to the [[Leicestershire Senior League]] and enjoyed success in the immediate post-war years as they won the title in 1946\u201347 and 1947\u201348 and were runners-up in 1948\u201349. At the start of the '50s the club made the decision to join the Central Alliance. However, on this occasion, their stay in that League was only brief and they joined the Birmingham & District League in 1954\u201355. They then rejoined the Central Alliance in 1959\u201360 and stayed in that League until 1974\u201375 during which time the League changed its title to the East Midlands Regional League.\n\n===Glory years===\nGresley dominated that League and in the fourteen seasons from 1961 to 1975 the lowest they finished was in fifth place as they won the title on four occasions, finished runners-up on four occasions, ended in third place on three occasions, fourth on two occasions and fifth only once. At the start of the 1975\u201376, they moved to the [[West Midlands (Regional) League]], which was a much stronger League, and in the early years they always ended in the lower regions of the table. However, after much hard work off the field, runners-up spot was achieved in 1985\u201386 and the following six seasons saw Gresley finish 4th, 4th, 2nd, 3rd, 1st and 1st. During that period they also won the [[Derbyshire Senior Cup]] on four successive occasions. Season 1990\u201391 was a particularly good one for Gresley\n\n===FA Vase finalists===\nIn addition to the league title and the Derbyshire Senior Cup win they also reached the final of the [[FA Vase]] and so had the honour of playing at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. Their opponents were Guiseley and some national newspapers reported it as 'the most exciting Wembley Cup Final ever'. When one looks at the goals' sequence one can see how the game earned that accolade: After 31 minutes the score was [[Guiseley F.C.|Guiseley]] 3\u20130 Gresley, but Gresley came back and grabbed a very dramatic equaliser in injury time at the end of the ninety minutes. Then in extra time Gresley went 4\u20133 in front but this time Guiseley scored a very dramatic equaliser as they levelled things in injury time at the end of the second half of extra time.\n\nThe replay at [[Bramall Lane]] saw Gresley lose by 3\u20131. However, despite that tremendous season their application to join the Southern League was not successful but they battled on to win the league again the following season. This time their application to the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] was successful and they were placed in the Midland Division for the 1992\u201393 season.\n\n===Disappointment and success===\nThat 1993\u201394 season had some disappointment for Gresley as they lost in the semi-final of the FA Vase and so narrowly missed another trip to [[Wembley]], but in the League they confounded everyone by finishing as runners-up and so gained promotion to the Premier Division at the first attempt. The 1993\u201394 season saw them consolidate in 14th position but medals did come to the club as they again won the [[Derbyshire]] Senior Cup and reached the Final of the Southern League Cup. An improved League position of 8th was achieved in 1994\u201395 and that season saw them reaching the First Round Proper of the [[FA Cup]] for only the second time ever before losing away to [[Crewe]].\n\n[[Paul Futcher]] was appointed manager with [[Garry Birtles]], the former England International, his assistant on 2 November 1995. Rovers improved their League position yet again in 1995\u201396 as they ended the season in 5th place and had the bonus of winning the [[Derbyshire Senior Cup]] yet again.\n\nThe season 1996\u201397 was the best in the club's long history because in addition to retaining the Derbyshire Senior Cup they also won the Southern League Premier Division championship. Rovers were unbeaten in their first seventeen league games (won 10 drawn 7) and were league leaders for 31 weeks.\n\nThe title was finally won with a 3\u20131 home victory against [[Gloucester City A.F.C.|Gloucester City]] at the Moat Ground on 26 April 1997. Gresley Rovers became the first [[Derbyshire]] side and first village side to win this prestigious trophy but ground grading meant that they were unable to gain promotion to the [[Football Conference]]. The game was also notable for serious crowd disorder between the two sets of fans after Gresley's opening goal which led to the game being delayed for 25 minutes as fighting spilled onto the pitch. Derby County were willing to lend Gresley their recently vacated [[Baseball Ground]] until the required standards could be met but this was rejected by the footballing authorities.\n\nPaul Futcher the Manager during that campaign left during the close season and his Assistant Manager Garry Birtles stepped up into the Manager's position. The disappointment of not being promoted to the Football Conference saw many of Gresley's players leave the club. The 1997\u201398 season saw Gresley finish in the bottom half of the Southern League Premier Division.\n\n===Relegation===\n[[Image:Elvis gresley.jpg|thumb|right|Elvis Gresley, the club's mascot]]\nThe 1998\u201399 season will go down in the history of Gresley Rovers as one of the worst.

Gresley had a thin squad due to the loss of income the postponements brought and were also playing twice a week most weeks from February to the end of the season. A lot of the re-arranged home games were on Tuesday nights meaning attendances fell but this was also due to poor form. A run of nine straight losses came in March, as injuries, suspensions and availability issues - as well as some below-par displays - took their toll, Gresley eventually ending the season in 16th place. On the 23rd May 2016 Gary Ricketts resigned due to personal reasons and Dave Langston left the club to become manager of [[Lichfield City F.C.|Lichfield City]].\n\nFor the 2016\u201317 season the main stand was renamed after Pat Murray, a local councillor, as he agreed to donate \u00a31,500 to the club. Pre-season saw the departure of the two best performing 2015-16 players as voted by supporters. Supporters player of the year runner up Jack Langston and the Supporters' ''player-of-the-year'' John Guy both moved to [[Belper Town F.C.|Belper Town]] to join up with former Moatmen Eric Graves, Alex Steadman, Jordan Ball, Kyle Bryant, Luke Edwards and Bradley Wells. On 10 June 2016, Gresley appointed, former St. Kitts and Nevis international, Damion Beckford-Quailey as their new manager. Damion named Hannah Dingley as his assistant manager and [[Brian Quailey]] and Chris Cowan as coaches. Further players departed the club including highly rated teenager Ryan King. The 2016/17 season began strong with 16 points from the first 8 games. However, only five wins followed from the next 32 games which lead to influential forwards Pearson Mwanyongo and Tendai Chitiza leaving the club. Damion's side went on a good run in the Derbyshire Senior Cup reaching the final. However, Gresley finished the season in 18th place.\n\nThe following pre-season saw star forward Reece Morris leave the club after picking up 4 awards for the 2016\u201317 season. The 2017\u201318 season was one to forget for Gresley supporters. Gresley featured towards the bottom of the table all season but they retained their place in the [[Northern Premier League Division One South]] with 4 games remaining. The following week saw the Chairman, Vice Chairman and manager all step down with most of the first team squad leaving with 3 matches still to play.\n\n==Stadium==\nThe club has played at the '''Moat Ground''' since 1909.

[[Japanese language|Japanese]]\n| shi || shi\n|-\n|}\nThe [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word for ''four'' ({{linktext|\u56db}}, [[pinyin]]: s\u00ec, [[jyutping]]: sei<sup>3</sup>), sounds quite similar to the word for ''death'' ({{linktext|\u6b7b}}, [[pinyin]]: s\u01d0, [[jyutping]]: sei<sup>2</sup>), in many [[varieties of Chinese]]. Similarly, the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]], [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] and [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] words for ''four'', shi (\u3057, [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) and sa (\uc0ac, [[Korean language|Korean]]), sound similar or identical to ''death'' in each language (see [[Korean numerals]], [[Japanese numerals]], [[Vietnamese numerals]]). Tetraphobia is known to occur in Korea and Japan since the two words sound identical, but not at all in Vietnam because they carry different [[Vietnamese phonology#Tone|tones]] (in the case of the word for \"four\", whether it is the Sino-Vietnamese reading ''t\u1ee9'' or the more common non-Sino-Vietnamese reading ''t\u01b0'', neither sounds like the word for \"death\" which is ''t\u1eed'') and Vietnamese does not use Sino-Vietnamese numerals as often in the first place.\n\nSpecial care may be taken to avoid occurrences or reminders of the number 4 during everyday life, especially during festive holidays or when a family member is ill. Mentioning the number 4 around a sick relative is strongly avoided. Giving four of something is strongly discouraged. [[Elevator]]s in Asia and Asian neighborhoods often skip the 4th floor. Military aircraft and ships also avoid the number 4 (such as in the South Korean and Taiwanese navies). April 4 is also considered an exceptionally unlucky day, much like [[Friday the 13th]] in the West.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nSimilarly, {{num|14}}, {{num|24}}, {{num|42}}, etc. are also to be avoided due to the presence of the digit 4 in these numbers. In these countries, these floor numbers are often skipped in buildings, ranging from hotels to offices to apartments, as well as hospitals. Table number 4, 14, 24, 42, etc. are also often left out in wedding dinners or other social gatherings in these countries. In many residential complexes, building block 4, 14, 24, etc. are either omitted or replaced with block 3A, 13A and 23A. Hospitals are of grave concern and the number 4 is regularly avoided altogether. Tetraphobia can dictate property prices. Neighborhoods have removed four from their street names and become more profitable as a result.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In the same way, buildings with multiple fours can suffer price cuts.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Four is also avoided in phone numbers, security numbers, business cards, addresses, ID numbers and other numbers and are considered severe as they are personally attached to the person.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nTetraphobia far surpasses [[triskaidekaphobia]] (Western superstitions around the number 13). It even permeates the business world in these regions of Asia.<ref name=\"TetraBiz\">{{cite web |url=http://www.acclaro.com/translation-localization-blog/tetraphobia-and-doing-business-in-asia-252 |title=Doing business in Tetraphobic Asia}}</ref>\n\n== Cultural examples by regions ==\n\n===In Mainland China===\n{{See also|Numbers in Chinese culture#Unlucky numbers}}\nChinese is a tonal language with a comparatively small inventory of permitted syllables, resulting in an exceptionally large number of [[homophone]] words. Many of the numbers are homophones or near-homophones of other words and have therefore acquired superstitious meanings.\n\nThe Chinese avoid phone numbers and addresses with fours because four means \"death\" in Chinese  (tetrathanaticism is unique to [[Sino-Tibetan]] languages), especially when they are combined with another number that changes the meaning. Example: \u201c94\u201d could be interpreted as being dead for a long time.\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]] makes free use of the number 4 in many military designations for [[People's Liberation Army]] equipment, with examples including the [[Dongfeng-4]] ICBM, [[Type 094 submarine]], and [[Type 054A frigate]], although the practice of starting aircraft designations with 5 leads some{{who|date=February 2017}} to speculate that it avoids the starting numeral 4 for aircraft designations much as the United States avoids use of the number 13 in that context.<ref name=\"SecT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/4.htm |title=Chinese Military Tetraphobia}}</ref> By contrast, the navies of the [[Republic of China Navy|Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and of [[Republic of Korea Navy|South Korea]] refrain from using the number 4 when assigning [[pennant number]]s to their ships.\n\nWhile in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking regions in China, 14 and 74 are considered more unlucky than the individual 4, since 14 (\u5341\u56db, pinyin: sh\u00ed s\u00ec) sounds like \"is dead\" (\u662f\u6b7b, pinyin: sh\u00ec s\u01d0) and 74 (\u4e03\u5341\u56db, pinyin: q\u012b sh\u00ed s\u00ec) like \"is already dead\" (\u5176\u5b9e\u6b7b, pinyin: q\u012b sh\u00ed s\u01d0) or \"will die in anger\" (\u6c23\u6b7b, pinyin: q\u00ec s\u01d0).\n\nWhen [[Beijing]] lost its bid to stage the [[2000 Olympic Games]], it was speculated that the reason China did not pursue a bid for the following [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Games]] was due to the unpopularity of the number 4 in China. Instead, the city waited another four years, and would eventually host the [[2008 Olympic Games]], the number eight being a lucky number in Chinese culture.\n\nIn recent years China has also avoided using the number 4 in aircraft registrations. An example is China Southern Airlines, with their A330s. One A330 is registered as B-8363, while the next is B-8365 and following B-8366. After B-8366 there is B-1062, B-1063 then B-1065, to avoid using the number 4 as in B-8364 and 1064. However this policy only applies for aircraft that end with 4, so you'll see B-8426 but not B-8264. <ref>https://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/China%20Southern%20Airlines-active-a330-35.htm</ref>\n\n===In Hong Kong===\nIn [[Hong Kong]], some apartments such as Vista Paradiso and [[Union Square (Hong Kong)#The Arch|The Arch]] skip all the floors from 40 to 49, which is the entire 40s. Immediately above the 39th floor is the 50th floor, leading many who are not aware of tetraphobia to believe that some floors are missing. Tetraphobia is not the main reason, but rather as an excuse to have apartments with 'higher' floors, thus increasing the price, because higher floors in Hong Kong apartments are usually more expensive (see [[39 Conduit Road]]). For [[Cantonese]] speakers, 14 and 24 are considered more unlucky than the individual 4, since 14 ({{zh|cy=sahp sei}}) sounds like \"will certainly die\" ({{lang|zh-hk|\u5be6\u6b7b}}, {{zh|cy=saht s\u00e9i}}), and 24 ({{zh|cy=yih sei}}) sounds like \"easy to die\" ({{lang|zh-hk|\u6613\u6b7b}}, {{zh|cy=yih s\u00e9i}}).\n\nDue to the blending of East Asian and Western cultures, it is possible in some buildings that both the [[thirteenth floor]] and the fourteenth floor are skipped, causing the twelfth floor to precede the fifteenth floor, along with all the other 4s. Thus a building whose top floor is numbered 100 would, in fact, have just eighty floors.\n\n===In Taiwan===\nIn Taiwan not using house numbers ending in 4 without remembering to occasionally skip numbers on the opposite side too, often results in the two sides of a street getting more and more out of sync as one advances.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jidanni.org/geo/house_numbering/four.html |title=\u9580\u724c\u5fcc\u56db\u4e4b\u914d\u5957\uff0c \u4ee5\u7dad\u6301\u5de6\u53f3\u5354\u8abf Methods to balance house numbers opposite skipped 4|website=jidanni.org}}</ref>\n\n===In Southeast Asia===\nBecause of the significant population of Chinese and influence of Chinese culture in Southeast Asia, 4 is also considered to be unlucky.\n\nIn buildings of [[Malaysia]], where Chinese are significant in population with 25% of Malaysians and 75% of Singaporeans being Chinese, the floor number 4 or house address with number 4 is occasionally skipped.\n\nSingaporean public transport operator [[SBS Transit]] has omitted the number plates for some of its buses whose numbers end with '4' due to this, so if a bus is registered as SBS***3*, SBS***4* will be omitted and the next bus to be registered will be SBS***5*.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Issue/straitstimes20080611-1# |title=Straits Times: DRIVER TRAPPED IN BUS AFTER COLLISION |last= |first= |date=June 11, 2008 |work= |page=34 |access-date=December 2, 2016 |via=NLB E-resources}}</ref> Note that this only applies to certain buses and not others and that the final asterisk is the checksum letter and not a number. For example, if the bus is registered as SBS7533J, SBS7534G will be omitted and the next bus to be registered will be SBS7535D.\n\nSingaporean public transport operator [[SMRT Corporation|SMRT]] has omitted the '4' as the first digit of the serial number of the train cars as well as the [[SMRT Buses]] NightRider services {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}.\n\nIn [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], several skyscraper buildings skip 4th and 14th floor, especially those which are funded by Chinese descendants. For example in [[The Plaza Semanggi|Plaza Semanggi]], 4th floor is replaced by 3A. In [[The Energy Tower]], 39th floor is followed by 50th floor. Some buildings, mostly owned by non-Chinese, have a 4th floor. Popular examples are government buildings, the [[Sarinah]] department store and [[Pacific Place Jakarta|Pacific Place]].\n\nIn [[Vietnam]], the [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] words for \"four\" (t\u1ee9) is used more in formal context than in everyday life and its spoken sound is clearly different from word for \"death\" (t\u1eed). The [[Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]] word \"b\u1ed1n\" equivalent to word \"t\u1ee9\" is often used, therefore the number 4 is rarely avoided. Even so, in the past Vietnamese people often named their children \"t\u01b0\" or \"t\u1ee9\", which means \"the fourth child born in family\".\n\n===In South Korea===\nIn [[South Korea]], tetraphobia is less extreme; the number 4 sounds like \"decease\" and \"died\" (\uc0ac), but the floor number 4 or room number 4 is almost always skipped in hospitals, funeral halls, and similar public buildings. In other buildings, the fourth floor is sometimes labelled \"F\" (Four) instead of \"4\" in elevators. Apartment numbers containing multiple occurrences of the number 4 (such as 404) are likely to be avoided to an extent that the value of the property is adversely affected. The national railroad, [[Korail]], left out the locomotive number 4444 when numbering a locomotive class from 4401 upwards. Some of these combinations were considered more unlucky than the individual 4, 14 sounds like \"Time to be deceased\" ('''\uc0ac'''\ub9dd \ud560 '''\uc2dc'''\uac04), 44 sounds like \"Died and Deceased\" ('''\uc0ac'''\ub9dd \ubc0f '''\uc0ac'''\ub9dd\uc790).\n\n===Outside Asia===\nEfforts to accommodate tetraphobia-related sensitivities have been seen in [[Canada]] which has a significant population of [[Chinese Canadians|Chinese descent]]. [[Richmond Hill, Ontario]], banned the number four on new houses in June 2013. Property developers in [[Vancouver]] omitted the number from new buildings until October 2015, when the city banned non-sequential numbering schemes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tetraphobia: Nothing to fear... |url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21679535-fear-itself-nothing-fear |accessdate=4 December 2015 |work=[[The Economist]] |date=4 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=No. 4 banned from new Richmond Hill, Ont., street addresses |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/06/04/richmond-hill-4.html |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=9 June 2013 |date=June 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nTetraphobia also plays a big role in [[Australia|Australian]] realty. According to Daily Mail Australia, Australian real estate property prices grew 10.5% in 2015.

[[Japanese language|Japanese]]\n| shi || shi\n|-\n|}\nThe [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word for ''four'' ({{linktext|\u56db}}, [[pinyin]]: s\u00ec, [[jyutping]]: sei<sup>3</sup>), sounds quite similar to the word for ''death'' ({{linktext|\u6b7b}}, [[pinyin]]: s\u01d0, [[jyutping]]: sei<sup>2</sup>), in many [[varieties of Chinese]]. Similarly, the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]], [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] and [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] words for ''four'', shi (\u3057, [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) and sa (\uc0ac, [[Korean language|Korean]]), sound similar or identical to ''death'' in each language (see [[Korean numerals]], [[Japanese numerals]], [[Vietnamese numerals]]). Tetraphobia is known to occur in Korea and Japan since the two words sound identical, but not at all in Vietnam because they carry different [[Vietnamese phonology#Tone|tones]] (in the case of the word for \"four\", whether it is the Sino-Vietnamese reading ''t\u1ee9'' or the more common non-Sino-Vietnamese reading ''t\u01b0'', neither sounds like the word for \"death\" which is ''t\u1eed'') and Vietnamese does not use Sino-Vietnamese numerals as often in the first place.\n\nSpecial care may be taken to avoid occurrences or reminders of the number 4 during everyday life, especially during festive holidays or when a family member is ill. Mentioning the number 4 around a sick relative is strongly avoided. Giving four of something is strongly discouraged. [[Elevator]]s in Asia and Asian neighborhoods often skip the 4th floor. Military aircraft and ships also avoid the number 4 (such as in the South Korean and Taiwanese navies). April 4 is also considered an exceptionally unlucky day, much like [[Friday the 13th]] in the West.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nSimilarly, {{num|14}}, {{num|24}}, {{num|42}}, etc. are also to be avoided due to the presence of the digit 4 in these numbers. In these countries, these floor numbers are often skipped in buildings, ranging from hotels to offices to apartments, as well as hospitals. Table number 4, 14, 24, 42, etc. are also often left out in wedding dinners or other social gatherings in these countries. In many residential complexes, building block 4, 14, 24, etc. are either omitted or replaced with block 3A, 13A and 23A. Hospitals are of grave concern and the number 4 is regularly avoided altogether. Tetraphobia can dictate property prices. Neighborhoods have removed four from their street names and become more profitable as a result.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In the same way, buildings with multiple fours can suffer price cuts.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Four is also avoided in phone numbers, security numbers, business cards, addresses, ID numbers and other numbers and are considered severe as they are personally attached to the person.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nTetraphobia far surpasses [[triskaidekaphobia]] (Western superstitions around the number 13). It even permeates the business world in these regions of Asia.<ref name=\"TetraBiz\">{{cite web |url=http://www.acclaro.com/translation-localization-blog/tetraphobia-and-doing-business-in-asia-252 |title=Doing business in Tetraphobic Asia}}</ref>\n\n== Cultural examples by regions ==\n\n===In Mainland China===\n{{See also|Numbers in Chinese culture#Unlucky numbers}}\nChinese is a tonal language with a comparatively small inventory of permitted syllables, resulting in an exceptionally large number of [[homophone]] words. Many of the numbers are homophones or near-homophones of other words and have therefore acquired superstitious meanings.\n\nThe Chinese avoid phone numbers and addresses with fours because four means \"death\" in Chinese  (tetrathanaticism is unique to [[Sino-Tibetan]] languages), especially when they are combined with another number that changes the meaning. Example: \u201c94\u201d could be interpreted as being dead for a long time.\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]] makes free use of the number 4 in many military designations for [[People's Liberation Army]] equipment, with examples including the [[Dongfeng-4]] ICBM, [[Type 094 submarine]], and [[Type 054A frigate]], although the practice of starting aircraft designations with 5 leads some{{who|date=February 2017}} to speculate that it avoids the starting numeral 4 for aircraft designations much as the United States avoids use of the number 13 in that context.<ref name=\"SecT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/4.htm |title=Chinese Military Tetraphobia}}</ref> By contrast, the navies of the [[Republic of China Navy|Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and of [[Republic of Korea Navy|South Korea]] refrain from using the number 4 when assigning [[pennant number]]s to their ships.\n\nWhile in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking regions in China, 14 and 74 are considered more unlucky than the individual 4, since 14 (\u5341\u56db, pinyin: sh\u00ed s\u00ec) sounds like \"is dead\" (\u662f\u6b7b, pinyin: sh\u00ec s\u01d0) and 74 (\u4e03\u5341\u56db, pinyin: q\u012b sh\u00ed s\u00ec) like \"is already dead\" (\u5176\u5b9e\u6b7b, pinyin: q\u012b sh\u00ed s\u01d0) or \"will die in anger\" (\u6c23\u6b7b, pinyin: q\u00ec s\u01d0).\n\nWhen [[Beijing]] lost its bid to stage the [[2000 Olympic Games]], it was speculated that the reason China did not pursue a bid for the following [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Games]] was due to the unpopularity of the number 4 in China. Instead, the city waited another four years, and would eventually host the [[2008 Olympic Games]], the number eight being a lucky number in Chinese culture.\n\nIn recent years China has also avoided using the number 4 in aircraft registrations. An example is China Southern Airlines, with their A330s. One A330 is registered as B-8363, while the next is B-8365 and following B-8366. After B-8366 there is B-1062, B-1063 then B-1065, to avoid using the number 4 as in B-8364 and 1064. However this policy only applies for aircraft that end with 4, so you'll see B-8426 but not B-8264. <ref>https://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/China%20Southern%20Airlines-active-a330-35.htm</ref>\n\n===In Hong Kong===\nIn [[Hong Kong]], some apartments such as Vista Paradiso and [[Union Square (Hong Kong)#The Arch|The Arch]] skip all the floors from 40 to 49, which is the entire 40s. Immediately above the 39th floor is the 50th floor, leading many who are not aware of tetraphobia to believe that some floors are missing. Tetraphobia is not the main reason, but rather as an excuse to have apartments with 'higher' floors, thus increasing the price, because higher floors in Hong Kong apartments are usually more expensive (see [[39 Conduit Road]]). For [[Cantonese]] speakers, 14 and 24 are considered more unlucky than the individual 4, since 14 ({{zh|cy=sahp sei}}) sounds like \"will certainly die\" ({{lang|zh-hk|\u5be6\u6b7b}}, {{zh|cy=saht s\u00e9i}}), and 24 ({{zh|cy=yih sei}}) sounds like \"easy to die\" ({{lang|zh-hk|\u6613\u6b7b}}, {{zh|cy=yih s\u00e9i}}).\n\nDue to the blending of East Asian and Western cultures, it is possible in some buildings that both the [[thirteenth floor]] and the fourteenth floor are skipped, causing the twelfth floor to precede the fifteenth floor, along with all the other 4s. Thus a building whose top floor is numbered 100 would, in fact, have just eighty floors.\n\n===In Taiwan===\nIn Taiwan not using house numbers ending in 4 without remembering to occasionally skip numbers on the opposite side too, often results in the two sides of a street getting more and more out of sync as one advances.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jidanni.org/geo/house_numbering/four.html |title=\u9580\u724c\u5fcc\u56db\u4e4b\u914d\u5957\uff0c \u4ee5\u7dad\u6301\u5de6\u53f3\u5354\u8abf Methods to balance house numbers opposite skipped 4|website=jidanni.org}}</ref>\n\n===In Southeast Asia===\nBecause of the significant population of Chinese and influence of Chinese culture in Southeast Asia, 4 is also considered to be unlucky.\n\nIn buildings of [[Malaysia]], where Chinese are significant in population with 25% of Malaysians and 75% of Singaporeans being Chinese, the floor number 4 or house address with number 4 is occasionally skipped.\n\nSingaporean public transport operator [[SBS Transit]] has omitted the number plates for some of its buses whose numbers end with '4' due to this, so if a bus is registered as SBS***3*, SBS***4* will be omitted and the next bus to be registered will be SBS***5*.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Issue/straitstimes20080611-1# |title=Straits Times: DRIVER TRAPPED IN BUS AFTER COLLISION |last= |first= |date=June 11, 2008 |work= |page=34 |access-date=December 2, 2016 |via=NLB E-resources}}</ref> Note that this only applies to certain buses and not others and that the final asterisk is the checksum letter and not a number. For example, if the bus is registered as SBS7533J, SBS7534G will be omitted and the next bus to be registered will be SBS7535D.\n\nSingaporean public transport operator [[SMRT Corporation|SMRT]] has omitted the '4' as the first digit of the serial number of the train cars as well as the [[SMRT Buses]] NightRider services {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}.\n\nIn [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], several skyscraper buildings skip 4th and 14th floor, especially those which are funded by Chinese descendants. For example in [[The Plaza Semanggi|Plaza Semanggi]], 4th floor is replaced by 3A. In [[The Energy Tower]], 39th floor is followed by 50th floor. Some buildings, mostly owned by non-Chinese, have a 4th floor. Popular examples are government buildings, the [[Sarinah]] department store and [[Pacific Place Jakarta|Pacific Place]].\n\nIn [[Vietnam]], the [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] words for \"four\" (t\u1ee9) is used more in formal context than in everyday life and its spoken sound is clearly different from word for \"death\" (t\u1eed). The [[Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]] word \"b\u1ed1n\" equivalent to word \"t\u1ee9\" is often used, therefore the number 4 is rarely avoided. Even so, in the past Vietnamese people often named their children \"t\u01b0\" or \"t\u1ee9\", which means \"the fourth child born in family\".\n\n===In South Korea===\nIn [[South Korea]], tetraphobia is less extreme; the number 4 sounds like \"decease\" and \"died\" (\uc0ac), but the floor number 4 or room number 4 is almost always skipped in hospitals, funeral halls, and similar public buildings. In other buildings, the fourth floor is sometimes labelled \"F\" (Four) instead of \"4\" in elevators. Apartment numbers containing multiple occurrences of the number 4 (such as 404) are likely to be avoided to an extent that the value of the property is adversely affected. The national railroad, [[Korail]], left out the locomotive number 4444 when numbering a locomotive class from 4401 upwards. Some of these combinations were considered more unlucky than the individual 4, 14 sounds like \"Time to be deceased\" ('''\uc0ac'''\ub9dd \ud560 '''\uc2dc'''\uac04), 44 sounds like \"Died and Deceased\" ('''\uc0ac'''\ub9dd \ubc0f '''\uc0ac'''\ub9dd\uc790).\n\n===Outside Asia===\nEfforts to accommodate tetraphobia-related sensitivities have been seen in [[Canada]] which has a significant population of [[Chinese Canadians|Chinese descent]]. [[Richmond Hill, Ontario]], banned the number four on new houses in June 2013. Property developers in [[Vancouver]] omitted the number from new buildings until October 2015, when the city banned non-sequential numbering schemes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tetraphobia: Nothing to fear... |url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21679535-fear-itself-nothing-fear |accessdate=4 December 2015 |work=[[The Economist]] |date=4 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=No. 4 banned from new Richmond Hill, Ont., street addresses |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/06/04/richmond-hill-4.html |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=9 June 2013 |date=June 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nTetraphobia also plays a big role in [[Australia|Australian]] realty. According to Daily Mail Australia, Australian real estate property prices grew 10.5% in 2015. This jump in prices came from the new business buildings and high rises built in Sydney Australia avoiding any reference to the number four. They do not have four in their address nor in their floor numbers. They skip 4, 14, 24 and so on. One business building is a cooperate building under the company Sun Corporation.

In this sense, Jacobi can be seen to have anticipated present-day writers who criticize secular philosophy as [[Relativism|relativistic]] and dangerous for religious faith.\n\nIn his time, he was also well known among literary circles for his critique of the ''[[Sturm and Drang]]'' movement, and implicitly close associate and intimate partner of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], and his visions of atomized [[individualism]]. His literary projects were devoted to the reconciliation of Enlightenment individualism with social obligation.\n\nHe was the younger brother of poet [[Johann Georg Jacobi]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHe was born at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], the second son of a wealthy sugar merchant, and was educated for a commercial career which included a brief apprenticeship at a merchant house in Frankfurt-am-Main during 1759. Following, he was sent to [[Geneva]] for general education. Jacobi, of a retiring, meditative disposition, associated himself at Geneva mainly with the literary and scientific circle (of which the most prominent member was Le Sage).\n\nHe studied the works of [[Charles Bonnet]] closely, as well as the political ideas of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]]. In 1763 he was recalled to D\u00fcsseldorf and in the following year he married Elisbeth von Clermont and took over the management of his father's business.\n\nAfter a short time, he gave up his commercial career and in 1770 he became a member of the council for the duchies of J\u00fclich and Berg.  He distinguished himself by his ability in financial affairs and his zeal in social reform. Jacobi kept up his interest in literary and philosophic matters by an extensive correspondence. His mansion at Pempelfort, near D\u00fcsseldorf, was the centre of a distinguished literary circle. he helped to found a new literary journal with [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]. Some his earliest writings, mainly on practical or economic subjects, were published in this journal: ''[[Der Teutsche Merkur]].''\n\nHere too appeared in part the first of his philosophic works, ''Edward Allwill's Briefsammlung'' (1776), a combination of romance and speculation. This was followed in 1779 by ''Woldemar'', a philosophic novel, of very imperfect structure, but full of genial ideas, and giving the most complete picture of Jacobi's method of philosophizing.\n\nIn 1779, he visited [[Munich]] following his appointment as minister and privy councillor for the Bavarian department of customs and commerce. He opposed the mercantilistic policies of Bavaria and intended to liberalize local customs and taxes; but, after a short stay there, differences with his colleagues and with the authorities of [[Bavaria]], as well as his unwillingness to engage in a power struggle, drove him back to Pempelfort. The experience as well as its aftermath led to the publication of two essays in which Jacobi defended Adam Smith's theories of political economy. These essays were followed in 1785 by the work which first brought Jacobi into prominence as a philosopher.\n\n===Pantheism controversy===\n{{Main|Pantheism controversy}}\nA conversation with [[Gotthold Lessing]] in 1780 in which Lessing avowed that he knew no philosophy in the true sense of that word, save Spinozism, led him to a protracted study of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s works. After Lessing's death, just a couple of months later, Jacobi continued to engage with Spinozism in an exchange of letters with Lessing's close friend [[Moses Mendelssohn]], which began in 1783. These letters, published with commentary by Jacobi as ''Briefe \u00fcber die Lehre Spinozas'' (1785; 2nd ed., much enlarged and with important Appendices, 1789), expressed sharply and clearly Jacobi's strenuous objection to a dogmatic system in philosophy, and drew upon him the vigorous enmity of the [[Aufkl\u00e4rer]].\n\nJacobi was ridiculed for trying to reintroduce into philosophy the antiquated notion of unreasoning belief, was denounced as an enemy of reason, as a pietist, and as a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] in disguise, and was especially attacked for his use of the ambiguous term \"belief\". His next important work, ''David Hume \u00fcber den Glauben, oder Idealismus und Realismus'' (1787), was an attempt to show not only that the term ''[[wikt:Glaube#Noun|Glaube]]'' had been used by the most eminent writers to denote what he had employed it for in the ''Letters on Spinoza'', but that the nature of the cognition of facts as opposed to the construction of inferences could not be otherwise expressed. In this writing, and especially in the Appendix, Jacobi came into contact with the critical philosophy, and subjected the Kantian view of knowledge to searching examination.\n\nIn 1787, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi addressed, in his book On Faith, or Idealism and Realism, Kant's concept of \"thing-in-itself.\" Jacobi agreed that the objective thing-in-itself cannot be directly known. However, he stated, it must be taken on faith. A subject must believe that there is a real object in the external world that is related to the representation or mental idea that is directly known. This faith or belief is a result of revelation or immediately known, but logically unproved, truth. The real existence of a thing-in-itself is revealed or disclosed to the observing subject. In this way, the subject directly knows the ideal, subjective representations that appear in the mind, and strongly believes in the real, objective thing-in-itself that exists outside of the mind. By presenting the external world as an object of faith, Jacobi legitimized belief and its theological associations. \"\u2026[B]y reducing the external world to a matter of faith, he wanted merely to open a little door for faith in general\u2026.<ref>Schopenhauer, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, Ch. I</ref>\"\n\nIronically, the Pantheism Controversy led later German philosophers and writers to take an interest in [[pantheism]] and [[Spinozism]]. Jacobi's [[fideism]] remained unpopular, and instead his critique of Enlightenment rationalism led more German philosophers to explore [[atheism]] and wrestle with the perceived loss of philosophical foundations for [[theism]], [[myth]], and [[morality]]. Jacobi and the Pantheism Controversy he ignited remain important in European intellectual history, because he formulated (albeit critically) one of the first systematic statements of nihilism and represents an early example of the [[God is dead|death of God]] discourse.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 69\u201374 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nThe Pempelfort era came to an end in 1794 when the [[French Revolution]] spilled over into Germany following the [[French Revolutionary Wars|outbreak of war]] with the French Republic. The occupation of D\u00fcsseldorf by French Troops forced him to resettle and for nearly ten years live in Holstein. There he became intimately acquainted with [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]] (in whose Beitrage his important work, ''Uber das Unternehmen des Kriticismus, die Vernunft zu Verstande zu bringen'', was first published), and with [[Matthias Claudius]], the editor of the ''Wandsbecker Bote''.\n\n==== Atheism dispute ====\n{{Main|Atheism dispute}}\n[[Gottlieb Fichte]] was dismissed from [[university of Jena|Jena]] in 1799 as a result of a charge of atheism. He was accused of this in 1798, after publishing his essay \"Ueber den Grund unsers Glaubens an eine g\u00f6ttliche Weltregierung\" (\"On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance\"), which he had written in response to [[Friedrich Karl Forberg]]'s essay \"Development of the Concept of Religion\", in his ''Philosophical Journal''. For Fichte, God should be conceived primarily in moral terms: \"The living and efficaciously acting moral order is itself God.

Fichte's intemperate \"Appeal to the Public\" (\"Appellation an das Publikum\", 1799) as well as a more thoughtful response entitled \u201cFrom a Private Letter\u201d (1799), provoked [[F. H. Jacobi]] to publish ''Letter to Fichte'' (1799), in which he equated philosophy in general and Fichte's [[transcendental philosophy]] in particular with [[nihilism]] and the relation of his own philosophic principles to [[theology]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Breazeale|first=Dan|date=2001-08-30|title=Johann Gottlieb Fichte|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/johann-fichte/#1|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== President of Academy of sciences and retirement ====\nSoon after his return to Germany, Jacobi received a call to Munich in connection with the new academy of sciences just founded there. The loss of a considerable portion of his fortune induced him to accept this offer; he settled in Munich in 1804, and in 1807 became president of the academy.\n\nIn 1811 appeared his last philosophic work, directed against [[Friedrich Schelling]] specially (''Von den g\u00f6ttlichen Dingen und ihrer Offenbarung''), the first part of which, a review of the ''Wandsbecker Bote,'' had been written in 1798. A bitter reply from Schelling was left without answer by Jacobi, but gave rise to an animated controversy in which [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]] and [[Franz Xaver von Baader|Baader]] took prominent part.\n\nIn 1812 Jacobi retired from the office of president, and began to prepare a collected edition of his works. He died before this was completed. The edition of his writings was continued by his friend F Koppen, and was completed in 1825. The works fill six volumes, of which the fourth is in three parts. To the second is prefixed an introduction by Jacobi, which is at the same time an introduction to his philosophy. The fourth volume has also an important preface.\n\n==Thought==\nJacobi's philosophy is essentially un[[Systematic philosophy|systematic]]. A fundamental view which underlies all his thinking is brought to bear in succession upon those systematic doctrines which appear to stand most sharply in contradiction to it, and any positive philosophic results are given only occasionally. The leading idea of the whole is that of the complete separation between understanding [comprehension] and apprehension of real fact. For Jacobi, Understanding, or the logical faculty, is purely formal or elaborative, and its results never transcend the given material supplied to it. From the basis of immediate experience or perception thought proceeds by comparison and abstraction, establishing connections among facts, but remaining in its nature mediate and finite.\n\nThe principle of reason and consequent, the necessity of thinking each given fact of perception as conditioned, impels understanding towards an endless series of identical propositions, the records of successive comparisons and abstractions. The province of the understanding is therefore strictly the region of the conditioned; to it the world must present itself as a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]. If, then, there is objective truth at all, the existence of real facts must be made known to us otherwise than through the logical faculty of thought; and, as the regress from conclusion to premises must depend upon something not itself capable of logical grounding, mediate thought implies the consciousness of immediate truth.\n\nPhilosophy therefore must resign the hopeless ideal of a systematic (i.e. intelligible) explanation of things, and must content itself with the examination of the facts of consciousness. It is a mere prejudice of philosophic thinkers, a prejudice which has descended from [[Aristotle]], that mediate or demonstrated cognition is superior in cogency and value to the immediate perception of truths or facts.\n\nAs Jacobi starts with the doctrine that thought is partial and limited, applicable only to connect facts, but incapable of explaining their existence, it is evident that for him any demonstrative system of metaphysic which should attempt to subject all existence to the principle of logical ground must be repulsive. Now in modern philosophy the first and greatest demonstrative system of metaphysic is that of Spinoza{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}; it is, therefore, sensible that upon Spinoza's system Jacobi should first direct his criticism. A summary of the results of his examination is thus presented (''Werke'', i. 216-223):\n#[[Spinozism]] is [[atheism]];\n#the Kabbalistic philosophy, insofar as it is philosophy, is nothing but undeveloped or confused Spinozism;\n#the philosophy of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]] is not less [[fatalism|fatalistic]] than that of Spinoza, and carries a resolute thinker to the very principles of Spinoza;\n#every demonstrative method ends in [[fatalism]] ([[nihilism]]);\n#we can demonstrate only similarities (agreements, truths conditionally necessary), proceeding always in identical propositions; every proof presupposes something already proved, the principle of which is immediately given (''Offenbarung'', [[revelation]], is the term here employed by Jacobi, as by many later writers, e.g. [[Hermann Lotze|Lotze]], to denote the peculiar character of an immediate, unproved, given truth);\n#the keystone (''Element'') of all human knowledge and activity is belief (''Glaube,'' or \"[[faith]]\").\n\nOf these propositions, only the first and fourth require further explanation.\n\nJacobi, accepting the law of reason and consequent as the fundamental rule of demonstrative reasoning, and as the rule explicitly followed by Spinoza, points out that, if we proceed by applying this principle so as to recede from particular and qualified facts to the more general and abstract conditions, we land ourselves, not in the notion of an active, intelligent creator of the system of things, but in the notion of an all-comprehensive, indeterminate Nature, devoid of will or intelligence. Our unconditioned is either a pure abstraction, or else the impossible notion of a completed system of conditions. In either case the result is [[atheism]], and this result is necessary if the demonstrative method, the method of understanding, is regarded as the only possible means of knowledge.\n\nMoreover, the same method inevitably lands in [[fatalism]]/[[nihilism]]. For, if the action of the human will is to be made intelligible to understanding, it must be thought as a conditioned phenomenon, having its sufficient ground in preceding circumstances, and, in ultimate abstraction, as the outflow from nature which is the sum of conditions. But this is the fatalist conception, and any philosophy which accepts the law of reason and consequent as the essence of understanding is fatalistic/nihilistic. Thus for the scientific understanding there can be no [[God]] and no [[liberty]].\n\nIt is impossible that there should be a God, for if so he would of necessity be finite. But a finite God, a God that is known, is no God. It is impossible that there should be liberty, for if so the mechanical order of phenomena, by means of which they are comprehensible, would be disturbed, and we should have an unintelligible world, coupled with the requirement that it shall be understood. Cognition, then, in the strict sense, occupies the middle place between sense perception, which is belief in matters of sense, and reason, which is belief in supersensuous fact.\n\n==Works==\n*Early essays in ''[[Der Teutsche Merkur]]''.

In this sense, Jacobi can be seen to have anticipated present-day writers who criticize secular philosophy as [[Relativism|relativistic]] and dangerous for religious faith.\n\nIn his time, he was also well known among literary circles for his critique of the ''[[Sturm and Drang]]'' movement, and implicitly close associate and intimate partner of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], and his visions of atomized [[individualism]]. His literary projects were devoted to the reconciliation of Enlightenment individualism with social obligation.\n\nHe was the younger brother of poet [[Johann Georg Jacobi]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHe was born at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], the second son of a wealthy sugar merchant, and was educated for a commercial career which included a brief apprenticeship at a merchant house in Frankfurt-am-Main during 1759. Following, he was sent to [[Geneva]] for general education. Jacobi, of a retiring, meditative disposition, associated himself at Geneva mainly with the literary and scientific circle (of which the most prominent member was Le Sage).\n\nHe studied the works of [[Charles Bonnet]] closely, as well as the political ideas of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]]. In 1763 he was recalled to D\u00fcsseldorf and in the following year he married Elisbeth von Clermont and took over the management of his father's business.\n\nAfter a short time, he gave up his commercial career and in 1770 he became a member of the council for the duchies of J\u00fclich and Berg.  He distinguished himself by his ability in financial affairs and his zeal in social reform. Jacobi kept up his interest in literary and philosophic matters by an extensive correspondence. His mansion at Pempelfort, near D\u00fcsseldorf, was the centre of a distinguished literary circle. he helped to found a new literary journal with [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]. Some his earliest writings, mainly on practical or economic subjects, were published in this journal: ''[[Der Teutsche Merkur]].''\n\nHere too appeared in part the first of his philosophic works, ''Edward Allwill's Briefsammlung'' (1776), a combination of romance and speculation. This was followed in 1779 by ''Woldemar'', a philosophic novel, of very imperfect structure, but full of genial ideas, and giving the most complete picture of Jacobi's method of philosophizing.\n\nIn 1779, he visited [[Munich]] following his appointment as minister and privy councillor for the Bavarian department of customs and commerce. He opposed the mercantilistic policies of Bavaria and intended to liberalize local customs and taxes; but, after a short stay there, differences with his colleagues and with the authorities of [[Bavaria]], as well as his unwillingness to engage in a power struggle, drove him back to Pempelfort. The experience as well as its aftermath led to the publication of two essays in which Jacobi defended Adam Smith's theories of political economy. These essays were followed in 1785 by the work which first brought Jacobi into prominence as a philosopher.\n\n===Pantheism controversy===\n{{Main|Pantheism controversy}}\nA conversation with [[Gotthold Lessing]] in 1780 in which Lessing avowed that he knew no philosophy in the true sense of that word, save Spinozism, led him to a protracted study of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s works. After Lessing's death, just a couple of months later, Jacobi continued to engage with Spinozism in an exchange of letters with Lessing's close friend [[Moses Mendelssohn]], which began in 1783. These letters, published with commentary by Jacobi as ''Briefe \u00fcber die Lehre Spinozas'' (1785; 2nd ed., much enlarged and with important Appendices, 1789), expressed sharply and clearly Jacobi's strenuous objection to a dogmatic system in philosophy, and drew upon him the vigorous enmity of the [[Aufkl\u00e4rer]].\n\nJacobi was ridiculed for trying to reintroduce into philosophy the antiquated notion of unreasoning belief, was denounced as an enemy of reason, as a pietist, and as a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] in disguise, and was especially attacked for his use of the ambiguous term \"belief\". His next important work, ''David Hume \u00fcber den Glauben, oder Idealismus und Realismus'' (1787), was an attempt to show not only that the term ''[[wikt:Glaube#Noun|Glaube]]'' had been used by the most eminent writers to denote what he had employed it for in the ''Letters on Spinoza'', but that the nature of the cognition of facts as opposed to the construction of inferences could not be otherwise expressed. In this writing, and especially in the Appendix, Jacobi came into contact with the critical philosophy, and subjected the Kantian view of knowledge to searching examination.\n\nIn 1787, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi addressed, in his book On Faith, or Idealism and Realism, Kant's concept of \"thing-in-itself.\" Jacobi agreed that the objective thing-in-itself cannot be directly known. However, he stated, it must be taken on faith. A subject must believe that there is a real object in the external world that is related to the representation or mental idea that is directly known. This faith or belief is a result of revelation or immediately known, but logically unproved, truth. The real existence of a thing-in-itself is revealed or disclosed to the observing subject. In this way, the subject directly knows the ideal, subjective representations that appear in the mind, and strongly believes in the real, objective thing-in-itself that exists outside of the mind. By presenting the external world as an object of faith, Jacobi legitimized belief and its theological associations. \"\u2026[B]y reducing the external world to a matter of faith, he wanted merely to open a little door for faith in general\u2026.<ref>Schopenhauer, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, Ch. I</ref>\"\n\nIronically, the Pantheism Controversy led later German philosophers and writers to take an interest in [[pantheism]] and [[Spinozism]]. Jacobi's [[fideism]] remained unpopular, and instead his critique of Enlightenment rationalism led more German philosophers to explore [[atheism]] and wrestle with the perceived loss of philosophical foundations for [[theism]], [[myth]], and [[morality]]. Jacobi and the Pantheism Controversy he ignited remain important in European intellectual history, because he formulated (albeit critically) one of the first systematic statements of nihilism and represents an early example of the [[God is dead|death of God]] discourse.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 69\u201374 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nThe Pempelfort era came to an end in 1794 when the [[French Revolution]] spilled over into Germany following the [[French Revolutionary Wars|outbreak of war]] with the French Republic. The occupation of D\u00fcsseldorf by French Troops forced him to resettle and for nearly ten years live in Holstein. There he became intimately acquainted with [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]] (in whose Beitrage his important work, ''Uber das Unternehmen des Kriticismus, die Vernunft zu Verstande zu bringen'', was first published), and with [[Matthias Claudius]], the editor of the ''Wandsbecker Bote''.\n\n==== Atheism dispute ====\n{{Main|Atheism dispute}}\n[[Gottlieb Fichte]] was dismissed from [[university of Jena|Jena]] in 1799 as a result of a charge of atheism. He was accused of this in 1798, after publishing his essay \"Ueber den Grund unsers Glaubens an eine g\u00f6ttliche Weltregierung\" (\"On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance\"), which he had written in response to [[Friedrich Karl Forberg]]'s essay \"Development of the Concept of Religion\", in his ''Philosophical Journal''. For Fichte, God should be conceived primarily in moral terms: \"The living and efficaciously acting moral order is itself God. We require no other God, nor can we grasp any other\" (\"On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance\"). Fichte's intemperate \"Appeal to the Public\" (\"Appellation an das Publikum\", 1799) as well as a more thoughtful response entitled \u201cFrom a Private Letter\u201d (1799), provoked [[F. H. Jacobi]] to publish ''Letter to Fichte'' (1799), in which he equated philosophy in general and Fichte's [[transcendental philosophy]] in particular with [[nihilism]] and the relation of his own philosophic principles to [[theology]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Breazeale|first=Dan|date=2001-08-30|title=Johann Gottlieb Fichte|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/johann-fichte/#1|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== President of Academy of sciences and retirement ====\nSoon after his return to Germany, Jacobi received a call to Munich in connection with the new academy of sciences just founded there. The loss of a considerable portion of his fortune induced him to accept this offer; he settled in Munich in 1804, and in 1807 became president of the academy.\n\nIn 1811 appeared his last philosophic work, directed against [[Friedrich Schelling]] specially (''Von den g\u00f6ttlichen Dingen und ihrer Offenbarung''), the first part of which, a review of the ''Wandsbecker Bote,'' had been written in 1798.

But a finite God, a God that is known, is no God. It is impossible that there should be liberty, for if so the mechanical order of phenomena, by means of which they are comprehensible, would be disturbed, and we should have an unintelligible world, coupled with the requirement that it shall be understood. Cognition, then, in the strict sense, occupies the middle place between sense perception, which is belief in matters of sense, and reason, which is belief in supersensuous fact.\n\n==Works==\n*Early essays in ''[[Der Teutsche Merkur]]''.

Following the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], he exhibited great military talent, rapidly rising through the ranks and was made a [[brigadier general]] by 1794. He served with distinction in Italy and Germany, and was briefly Minister of War. His relationship with [[Napoleon]] was turbulent; nevertheless, Napoleon named him a [[Marshal of the Empire]] on the proclamation of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. Bernadotte played a significant role in the French victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], and was made [[Principality of Pontecorvo|Prince of Pontecorvo]] as a reward.\n\nIn 1810, Bernadotte was unexpectedly elected the [[heir-presumptive]] to the childless King [[Charles XIII of Sweden]], thanks to the advocacy of Baron [[Carl Otto M\u00f6rner]], a Swedish courtier and obscure member of the [[Riksdag of the Estates]].{{sfn|Cronholm|1902|pp=249\u201371}} He assumed the name Charles John and became the ''[[de facto]]'' regent and head of state. In 1813, following the sudden unprovoked French invasion of [[Swedish Pomerania]], Crown Prince Charles John aligned Sweden with Napoleon's enemies in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]], wherein he authored the Allied campaign plan, and commanded the Allied Army of the North that made the decisive attack on the last day of the catastrophic French defeat at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. He went on to defeat Denmark and forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]].\n\nUpon the death of [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] in 1818, Charles John ascended to the throne as the first monarch from the [[House of Bernadotte]]. He presided over a period of peace and prosperity, and reigned until his death in 1844.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Pau Bernadotte.JPG|100px|thumb|left|Bernadotte's birthplace in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France]]\nBernadotte was born in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, as the son of Jean Henri Bernadotte (1711\u20131780), [[prosecutor]] at Pau, and his wife (married at [[Boeil-Bezing|Boeil]], 20 February 1754) Jeanne de Saint-Jean (1728\u20131809), [[niece]] of the [[Lay Abbot]] of [[Sireix]]. The family name was originally du Poey (or de Pouey), but was changed to Bernadotte\u2014a surname of an ancestress at the beginning of the 17th century.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Soon after his birth, Baptiste was added to his name, to distinguish him from his elder brother Jean \u00c9vangeliste. Bernadotte himself added Jules to his first names as a tribute to the French Empire under [[Napoleon I]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}\n\nAt the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a local attorney. However, the death of his father when Bernadotte was just 17 stopped the youth from following his father's career.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 6</ref>\n\n==Early military career==\nBernadotte joined the army as a private in the [[R\u00e9giment Royal\u2013La Marine]] on 3 September 1780,<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 5</ref> and first served in the newly conquered territory of [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Subsequently, the R\u00e9giment stationed in [[Besan\u00e7on]], [[Grenoble]], [[Vienne]], [[Marseille]] and [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 8\u201313</ref><ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 14</ref> He reached the rank of sergeant in August 1785 and was nicknamed ''Sergeant Belle-Jambe'', for his smart appearance.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 11</ref> In early 1790 he was promoted to [[Adjudant-Major]], the highest rank for [[non-commissioned officer]]s in the Ancien R\u00e9gime.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 15</ref>\n\n==Revolutionary Wars==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], his eminent military qualities brought him speedy promotion.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Bernadotte's promotions came both from the esteem of his commanders as well as from his men; having been elected to the rank of lieutenant colonel and colonel by his men, though he refused both nominations in favor of traditional advancement.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 50\u201352, 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period of rapid advancement that the military qualities he became known for, daring assaults and Gasconades, came to the fore. Of the latter, Bernadotte was gifted in his ability to inspire his men to prodigious feats of valor. As Colonel and commander of the 71st Demi-Brigade, Bernadotte rallied his men, who were retreating in disorder before an Austrian attack, by tearing off his epaulettes, throwing them to the ground before his men and shouting \u201cIf you dishonor yourselves by flight, I refuse to remain your colonel!\u201d Soldiers left the ranks, gathered his epaulettes, pressed them into his hands, formed ranks and reformed the line and counter-attacked.<ref>Ibid, pp. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nBy 1794 he was promoted to brigadier, attached to the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} After [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] (26 June 1794), where he distinguished himself with a decisive attack and seizure of key terrain that led to the Austrian retreat, he then became a divisional general.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 92\u201394</ref>\n\nBernadotte played key roles throughout the next 18 months during the three French invasions into Germany; often employed in the place of honor during offensives leading the vanguard, and in retreat as a defensive specialist commanding the rearguard.<ref>Ibid. pp. 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nAt the [[Battle of Theiningen]] (1796), Bernadotte contributed, more than anyone else, to the successful retreat of the French army over the [[Rhine]] after its defeat by the [[Archduke Charles of Austria]].<ref>Ibid. pp. 110\u201314.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1797 he was ordered by the Directory to march with 20,000 men as reinforcements to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army in Italy.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} His successful crossing of the Alps through the storm in midwinter was highly praised but coldly received by the Italian Army.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 42</ref><ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 42</ref> Upon receiving insult from [[Dominique Martin Dupuy]], the commander of Milan, Bernadotte was to arrest him for insubordination.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 42\u201343</ref> However, Dupuy was a close friend of [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] and this started a long-lasting feud between Bernadotte and Napoleon's Chief of Staff.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 44</ref>\n\nHe had his first interview with Napoleon in Mantua and was appointed the commander of the 4th division.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 43</ref> During the invasion of Friuli and Istria, Bernadotte distinguished himself greatly at the passage of the [[Tagliamento]] where he led the vanguard, and at the capture of the fortress of Gradisca (19 March 1797).{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} After the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|18th Fructidor]], Napoleon ordered his generals to collect from their respective divisions' addresses in favor of the coup d'\u00e9tat of that day; but Bernadotte sent an address to the directory different from that which Napoleon wished for and without conveying it through Napoleon's hands.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter the [[treaty of Campo Formio]], Napoleon gave Bernadotte a friendly visit at his headquarters at Udine, but immediately after deprived him of half his division of the army of the Rhine, and commanded him to march the other half back to France.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} [[Paul Barras]], one of five directors, was cautious that Napoleon would overturn the Republic, so he appointed Bernadotte commander-in-chief of the Italian Army in order to offset Napoleon's power.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 60\u201361</ref> Bernadotte was pleased with this appointment but Napoleon lobbied [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to appoint him to the embassy of [[Vienna]] instead.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 61</ref> Bernadotte was very dissatisfied; he finally accepted the post in Vienna, but had to quit owing to the disturbances caused by his hoisting the [[Flag of France|tricolour]] over the [[embassy]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter returning from Vienna, he resided in Paris. He married [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary]] in August 1798, the daughter of a Marseilles merchant and [[Joseph Bonaparte]]'s sister-in-law.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} In November of the same year he was made commander of the army of observation on the upper Rhine. Although solicited to do so by Barras and Joseph Bonaparte, he did not take part in [[Coup of 30 Prairial VII|the coup d'\u00e9tat of the 30th Prairial]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 84</ref> From 2 July to 14 September he was [[List of Defence Ministers of France|Minister of War]], in which capacity he displayed great ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} However, his popularity and contacts with radical Jacobins aroused antipathy towards him in the government.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 88</ref> On the morning of 13 September he found his resignation announced in the Moniteur before he was aware that he had tendered it. This was a trick; played upon him by [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Siey\u00e8s]] and [[Roger Ducos]], the directors allied to Napoleon.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHe declined to help Napoleon Bonaparte stage his [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of November 1799]] but nevertheless accepted employment from the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and from April 1800 to 18 August 1801 Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the West, in the rebellious [[Vend\u00e9e]], and successfully restored its tranquility.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte proposed that Bernadotte head to New France to serve as governor of [[Louisiana]], which was to be transferred back to French control following the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. In accepting the position, Bernadotte requested additional soldiers, settlers, and funding to support the colony, but Napoleon refused. In response, Bernadotte, declined the posting and instead was named plenipotentiary ambassador to the United States.

In this capacity, as well as during his later command of the army of northern Germany, he created for himself a reputation for independence, incorruptibility, moderation, and administrative ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nDuring the campaign of 1805, Bernadotte, with his army corps from Hanover formed into the I Corps, commanded the Left Wing of the Grand Army overseeing Marmont's II Corps and having the majority of the Bavarian Army attached to his command; some 65,000 men or 1/4th of the Army. Bernadotte was also tasked with assuring France's newest ally, the Elector of Bavaria, [[Maximilian_I_Joseph_of_Bavaria|Maximillian Joseph]], that the Austrians would be driven from his country.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 150-151</ref><ref>Barton, D.

In pursuance of these orders, Bernadotte, separately from Davout, left Naumburg at dawn on the morning of the 14th for [[Dornburg]] and marched towards [[Apolda]], which he reached by 16:00. Hampered by the very poor state of the roads, he could not engage in the Battle of Jena, though he effectively compelled the Prussians to retreat from both battlefields by posting his troops on the heights of Apolda.{{sfn|Titeux, Eugene|1903|pp=86\u2013104}}{{sfn|Foucart, Paul Jean|1887|pp=694\u201397}}{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|pp=758, 764\u201365}}\nAfterwards, Bernadotte was accused of deliberately refusing to support Davout, who had unexpectedly encountered the Prussian main army at Auerst\u00e4dt, out of jealousy, and Napoleon, if reminiscences from St. Helena may be believed, once intended to put Bernadotte before a court-martial.{{sfn|Favier, Franck|2010|pp=137\u201339}}{{sfn|Palmer, Alan|1990|p=135}} In fact, he did what he had been ordered to do, and more fundamental responsibility for his absence rests upon the ambiguous and indirect orders issued by Berthier and Napoleon's unawareness of the Prussian position.{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|p=765}}{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Jena, Bernadotte crushed the Prussian Reserve Army, all fresh troops fortified behind a marsh and the River Saale, under [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1758\u20131822)|Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg]] at [[Battle of Halle|Halle]] (17 October 1806), though Imperial Headquarters did not much appreciate this victory.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 193</ref> When visiting Halle after the battle, and commenting on the degree of difficulty of storming a fortified position accessible only by a single bridge, Napoleon enigmatically commented \"Bernadotte stops at nothing.

As a consequence, Bernadotte's I Corps was too far away to take part in the [[Battle of Eylau]] (7 to 8 February 1807). Napoleon rebuked him for his absence but it became acknowledged that it was not due to Bernadotte, but Berthier's carelessness in dispatching the orderly.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 140\u201341</ref> The Russians resumed the offensive that summer and Bernadotte was attacked by, and defeated, a strong Prussian Corps at  [[Battle of Guttstadt-Deppen|Spanden]], preserving the French bridgehead over the [[Pas\u0142\u0119ka]], where he was nearly killed when a spent ball struck him in the neck.<ref>Barton, D.

However, Bernadotte maintained strict discipline amongst his troops and his good treatment of the Danes made him popular with the populace and Danish Royal Family. Upon his departure from Denmark he was one of few Frenchmen of the period to be awarded the [[Order of the Elephant]].<ref>Barton, pp. 194\u201396</ref>\n\nDuring Bernadotte's time as governor of the Hanseatic cities, the [[Abdications of Bayonne]] occurred, an event that triggered the [[Peninsular War]] that would play so large a role in Napoleon's defeat. For a time Napoleon considered the notion of placing Bernadotte on the Spanish throne; going so far as to hint at it in a letter to him. However, Bernadotte made it known to Napoleon that he didn't want the Spanish Crown.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 192\u201393.</ref> [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Bernadotte's friend and brother-in-law, was chosen instead. It was not the first, or last time, that Napoleon thought of placing Bernadotte on a foreign throne. Indeed, Napoleon on several occasions, both during his days as First Consul and then as Emperor, thought of naming Bernadotte (Napoleon also considered Murat) as his successor by adoption. Despite their rivalry, Napoleon felt that Bernadotte alone had the popularity, administrative and military skill to safeguard the Empire he had built. However, the birth of the [[Napoleon II|King of Rome]] put an end to Napoleon's need for an heir.<ref>Ibid. p. 209.</ref> Ironically, Bernadotte did eventually wear a crown, not through the auspices of Napoleon, but as an enemy of France.<ref>Ibid, pp. 192\u201395</ref>\n\nBeing recalled to Germany to assist in the new war between France and Austria, he received the command of the 9th Corps, which was mainly composed of [[Saxony|Saxons]].{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}  Further difficulties with Berthier, and being saddled with ill-prepared Saxons, combined with an illness, compelled Bernadotte to beg for release from service.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}} Bernadotte wrote to Napoleon that \"I see my efforts perpetually paralyzed by a hidden force over which I can not prevail.\"{{sfn|Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket |1930|pp=216\u201317}} Napoleon disregarded these appeals and Bernadotte proceeded with the campaign, commanding mostly foreign troops with few French troops under his command.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|pp=284\u201385}}\nAt the [[Battle of Wagram]] (5 July 1809), he entered battle with his Saxon corps, to which the division of [[Pierre-Louis Dupas|Dupas]] was attached and which formed his reserve. Resting on the French Left, Bernadotte's corps was battered during the night but resisted the full fury of the Austrian attack facing superior numbers. At a critical moment he ordered Dupas forward to his support; the latter replied that he had orders from the emperor to remain where he was. Having been badly mauled, and fully exposed ahead of the main French line, IX Corps withdrew from the village of Aderklaa against Napoleon's orders. On the second day of battle, 6 July 1809, IX Corps, having been mauled the night before, wherein Bernadotte struggled to rally his demoralized Saxons, was attacked by two Austrian corps, as part of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles's]] effort to break the French line. This time Bernadotte's depleted forces - he had only 6,000 infantry left - broke and fled (Bernadotte's Corps was not the only one to have broken that day, Mass\u00e9na's troops were also routed by the attack). The routed Saxons retreated in disorder toward Raasdorf as Bernadotte attempted to rally his men, where he encountered Napoleon. IX Corps rallied and played a further role in the battle. Rumors that Napoleon relieved Bernadotte of command on the spot at Raasdorf have long been the stuff of legend, but are not verified.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 223\u201325.</ref> After the battle, Bernadotte complained to Napoleon for having, in violation of all military rules, ordered Dupas to act independently of his command, and for having thereby caused great loss of life to the Saxons, and tendered his resignation. Napoleon accepted after he had become aware of an order of the day issued by Bernadotte in which he gave the Saxons credit for their courage in terms inconsistent with the emperor's official bulletin.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} Accounts of Bernadotte's role at Wagram are contradictory. While it is true that IX Corps broke on 6 July, as did other French formations, they later rallied and played a part in the victory. Moreover, Bernadotte fought with exceptional personal courage, at the head of his troops, and narrowly averted death when attacked by Austrian cavalry. It is likely that IX Corps' poor performance would have been forgotten, and Bernadotte would have retained his command, had he never published the controversial Order of the Day.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 227\u201328.</ref> However, Bernadotte's praise for the Saxons, as well as his mild and courteous treatment of them while under his command, was never forgotten by the Saxon officers and this would later have disastrous consequences for the French when a whole Saxon division defected to Bernadotte's Army of the North during a key moment of the [[Battle of Leipzig]].<ref>Smith, Digby (2001). pp. 225\u201329</ref>\n\nWith Bernadotte having returned to Paris, the [[Walcheren Campaign]] (July 1809) caused the French ministry in the absence of the emperor to entrust him with the defense of [[Antwerp]] with both regular French and Dutch troops along with the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 153</ref> Bernadotte, with his customary skill, took command of a chaotic situation wherein troops from all over the Empire and its vassal states, and raw conscripts, were sent to Holland under divided command. He re-organized and trained his forces, named by the Emperor as the Army of Antwerp, by instilling discipline in old soldiers too long at the depots and teaching raw conscripts their trade. Everywhere he instilled a fighting spirit, making an army out of a mob, and thus he rapidly brought the defenses of Antwerp to a high order of readiness.<ref>Barton, Plunkett (1921). pp. 237\u201340</ref> With Antwerp bristling with cannon and numerous defenders, and with the Army of Antwerp whipped into fighting shape, the British, vexed by poor leadership and with half the army immobilized with fever thanks to the insalubrious islands upon which they were quartered, realized that it was no longer possible to close the [[Scheldt]], or take Antwerp, and withdrew their forces.<ref>Howard, Martin (2012). pp. 139\u201347.</ref> In a proclamation issued to his troops at Antwerp he made an implied charge against Napoleon of having neglected to prepare the proper means of defense for the Belgian coast.

He was 61 years old and in poor health. He was also childless; [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Queen Charlotte]] had given birth to two children who had died in infancy, and there was no prospect of her bearing another child. The king had adopted a Danish prince, [[Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden|Charles August]], as his son soon after his coronation, but he had died just a few months after his arrival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/107273/Charles-XIII|title=Charles XIII \u2013 king of Sweden|publisher=}}</ref> Despite the fact that Napoleon favored his ally Danish King Frederick VI, Danish Prince [[Frederick Christian II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg|Frederick Christian]] initially had the most support to become Swedish Crown Prince as well.<ref name=norgoal>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JSZ8CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA221&lpg=PA221&dq=napoleon+prince+charles+john#v=onepage&q=napoleon%20prince%20charles%20john&f=false|title=Napoleon's Empire: European Politics in Global Perspective|first=Ute|last=Planert|page=221|date= 2015|accessdate=27 December 2018|isbn=978-1137455475}}</ref>\n\nThe Swedish court initially sounded out the emperor for his preferences on candidates for crown prince, whereupon Napoleon made it clear he preferred his son-in-law [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]], one of his nephews or one of his brothers. However, Eug\u00e8ne, serving as viceroy in Italy, did not wish to convert to Lutheranism, a prerequisite for accepting the Swedish offer. Moreover, none of Napoleon's brothers was interested in going to Sweden and his nephews were too young, as the Swedes did not want the hazards of minority rule in the event King Charles died prematurely.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 250\u201356, 268\u201372.</ref> The matter was decided by an obscure Swedish courtier, son of Baron Gustav M\u00f6rner, a commander of the Swedish force captured by Bernadotte at L\u00fcbeck, Baron [[Karl Otto M\u00f6rner]], who, entirely on his own initiative, offered the succession to the Swedish crown to Bernadotte.

Following his first meeting with his new heir, Charles XIII (who had initially opposed Bernadotte's candidacy) remarked to his aide-de-camp count [[Charles de Suremain]] \"My dear Suremain, I have gambled heavily, and I believe that after all I have won.\"<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 251</ref>  He also made himself well liked by Queen Charlotte, who regarded him a \"gentleman in every sense of the word\",<ref name=\"autogenerated1942\">Hedvig Elisabet Charlotta, Hedvig Elisabeth Charlottas dagbok. 9, 1812\u20131817, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1942</ref> and established a net of contact within the Swedish aristocracy, befriending in particular the Brahe family through his favorite [[Magnus Brahe (1790-1844)|Magnus Brahe]] and countess [[Aurora Wilhelmina Brahe]], whose cousin [[Mariana Koskull]] became his lover.<ref name=\"autogenerated1942\"/>\n\nThe infirmity of the old King and the dissensions in the [[Privy Council of Sweden]] placed the government, and especially the control of [[foreign policy]], entirely in his hands. The keynote of his whole policy was the acquisition of Norway as a compensation for the loss of Finland and Bernadotte proved anything but a puppet of France.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Many Swedes expected him to reconquer Finland, which had been ceded to Russia; however, the Crown Prince was aware of its difficulty for reasons of the desperate situation of the state finance and the reluctance of the Finnish people to return to Sweden.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). p. 39</ref> Even if Finland was regained, he thought, it would put Sweden into a new cycle of conflicts with a powerful neighbor because there was no guarantee Russia would accept the loss as final.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 181</ref> Therefore, he made up his mind to make a united [[Scandinavian Peninsula|Scandinavian peninsula]], which was easier to defend, by taking Norway (intentionally without the ancient and remote provinces of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]) from Denmark and uniting her to Sweden.

This demand would mean a hard blow to the national economy and the Swedish population. Sweden reluctantly declared war against Great Britain but it was treated by both countries as being merely nominal, although Swedish imports of British goods decreased from \u00a34,871 million in 1810 to \u00a3523 million in the following year.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). pp. 40\u201341</ref><ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 259</ref>\n\nIn January 1812, French troops suddenly invaded [[Swedish Pomerania]] and the [[island of R\u00fcgen]].<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 265</ref> The decisive reason was that Napoleon, before marching to Moscow, had to secure his rear and dared not trust a Swedish continental foothold behind him.<ref name=\"Scott, Franklin D.1988.

Following the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], he exhibited great military talent, rapidly rising through the ranks and was made a [[brigadier general]] by 1794. He served with distinction in Italy and Germany, and was briefly Minister of War. His relationship with [[Napoleon]] was turbulent; nevertheless, Napoleon named him a [[Marshal of the Empire]] on the proclamation of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. Bernadotte played a significant role in the French victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], and was made [[Principality of Pontecorvo|Prince of Pontecorvo]] as a reward.\n\nIn 1810, Bernadotte was unexpectedly elected the [[heir-presumptive]] to the childless King [[Charles XIII of Sweden]], thanks to the advocacy of Baron [[Carl Otto M\u00f6rner]], a Swedish courtier and obscure member of the [[Riksdag of the Estates]].{{sfn|Cronholm|1902|pp=249\u201371}} He assumed the name Charles John and became the ''[[de facto]]'' regent and head of state. In 1813, following the sudden unprovoked French invasion of [[Swedish Pomerania]], Crown Prince Charles John aligned Sweden with Napoleon's enemies in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]], wherein he authored the Allied campaign plan, and commanded the Allied Army of the North that made the decisive attack on the last day of the catastrophic French defeat at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. He went on to defeat Denmark and forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]].\n\nUpon the death of [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] in 1818, Charles John ascended to the throne as the first monarch from the [[House of Bernadotte]]. He presided over a period of peace and prosperity, and reigned until his death in 1844.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Pau Bernadotte.JPG|100px|thumb|left|Bernadotte's birthplace in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France]]\nBernadotte was born in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, as the son of Jean Henri Bernadotte (1711\u20131780), [[prosecutor]] at Pau, and his wife (married at [[Boeil-Bezing|Boeil]], 20 February 1754) Jeanne de Saint-Jean (1728\u20131809), [[niece]] of the [[Lay Abbot]] of [[Sireix]]. The family name was originally du Poey (or de Pouey), but was changed to Bernadotte\u2014a surname of an ancestress at the beginning of the 17th century.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Soon after his birth, Baptiste was added to his name, to distinguish him from his elder brother Jean \u00c9vangeliste. Bernadotte himself added Jules to his first names as a tribute to the French Empire under [[Napoleon I]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}\n\nAt the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a local attorney. However, the death of his father when Bernadotte was just 17 stopped the youth from following his father's career.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 6</ref>\n\n==Early military career==\nBernadotte joined the army as a private in the [[R\u00e9giment Royal\u2013La Marine]] on 3 September 1780,<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 5</ref> and first served in the newly conquered territory of [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Subsequently, the R\u00e9giment stationed in [[Besan\u00e7on]], [[Grenoble]], [[Vienne]], [[Marseille]] and [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 8\u201313</ref><ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 14</ref> He reached the rank of sergeant in August 1785 and was nicknamed ''Sergeant Belle-Jambe'', for his smart appearance.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 11</ref> In early 1790 he was promoted to [[Adjudant-Major]], the highest rank for [[non-commissioned officer]]s in the Ancien R\u00e9gime.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 15</ref>\n\n==Revolutionary Wars==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], his eminent military qualities brought him speedy promotion.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} Bernadotte's promotions came both from the esteem of his commanders as well as from his men; having been elected to the rank of lieutenant colonel and colonel by his men, though he refused both nominations in favor of traditional advancement.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 50\u201352, 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period of rapid advancement that the military qualities he became known for, daring assaults and Gasconades, came to the fore. Of the latter, Bernadotte was gifted in his ability to inspire his men to prodigious feats of valor. As Colonel and commander of the 71st Demi-Brigade, Bernadotte rallied his men, who were retreating in disorder before an Austrian attack, by tearing off his epaulettes, throwing them to the ground before his men and shouting \u201cIf you dishonor yourselves by flight, I refuse to remain your colonel!\u201d Soldiers left the ranks, gathered his epaulettes, pressed them into his hands, formed ranks and reformed the line and counter-attacked.<ref>Ibid, pp. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nBy 1794 he was promoted to brigadier, attached to the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}} After [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]'s victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] (26 June 1794), where he distinguished himself with a decisive attack and seizure of key terrain that led to the Austrian retreat, he then became a divisional general.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1914). ''Bernadotte: The First Phase''. pp. 92\u201394</ref>\n\nBernadotte played key roles throughout the next 18 months during the three French invasions into Germany; often employed in the place of honor during offensives leading the vanguard, and in retreat as a defensive specialist commanding the rearguard.<ref>Ibid. pp. 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nAt the [[Battle of Theiningen]] (1796), Bernadotte contributed, more than anyone else, to the successful retreat of the French army over the [[Rhine]] after its defeat by the [[Archduke Charles of Austria]].<ref>Ibid. pp. 110\u201314.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1797 he was ordered by the Directory to march with 20,000 men as reinforcements to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army in Italy.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} His successful crossing of the Alps through the storm in midwinter was highly praised but coldly received by the Italian Army.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 42</ref><ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 42</ref> Upon receiving insult from [[Dominique Martin Dupuy]], the commander of Milan, Bernadotte was to arrest him for insubordination.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 42\u201343</ref> However, Dupuy was a close friend of [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] and this started a long-lasting feud between Bernadotte and Napoleon's Chief of Staff.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 44</ref>\n\nHe had his first interview with Napoleon in Mantua and was appointed the commander of the 4th division.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 43</ref> During the invasion of Friuli and Istria, Bernadotte distinguished himself greatly at the passage of the [[Tagliamento]] where he led the vanguard, and at the capture of the fortress of Gradisca (19 March 1797).{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} After the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|18th Fructidor]], Napoleon ordered his generals to collect from their respective divisions' addresses in favor of the coup d'\u00e9tat of that day; but Bernadotte sent an address to the directory different from that which Napoleon wished for and without conveying it through Napoleon's hands.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter the [[treaty of Campo Formio]], Napoleon gave Bernadotte a friendly visit at his headquarters at Udine, but immediately after deprived him of half his division of the army of the Rhine, and commanded him to march the other half back to France.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} [[Paul Barras]], one of five directors, was cautious that Napoleon would overturn the Republic, so he appointed Bernadotte commander-in-chief of the Italian Army in order to offset Napoleon's power.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 60\u201361</ref> Bernadotte was pleased with this appointment but Napoleon lobbied [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to appoint him to the embassy of [[Vienna]] instead.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 61</ref> Bernadotte was very dissatisfied; he finally accepted the post in Vienna, but had to quit owing to the disturbances caused by his hoisting the [[Flag of France|tricolour]] over the [[embassy]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nAfter returning from Vienna, he resided in Paris. He married [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary]] in August 1798, the daughter of a Marseilles merchant and [[Joseph Bonaparte]]'s sister-in-law.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} In November of the same year he was made commander of the army of observation on the upper Rhine. Although solicited to do so by Barras and Joseph Bonaparte, he did not take part in [[Coup of 30 Prairial VII|the coup d'\u00e9tat of the 30th Prairial]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 84</ref> From 2 July to 14 September he was [[List of Defence Ministers of France|Minister of War]], in which capacity he displayed great ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} However, his popularity and contacts with radical Jacobins aroused antipathy towards him in the government.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 88</ref> On the morning of 13 September he found his resignation announced in the Moniteur before he was aware that he had tendered it. This was a trick; played upon him by [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Siey\u00e8s]] and [[Roger Ducos]], the directors allied to Napoleon.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHe declined to help Napoleon Bonaparte stage his [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of November 1799]] but nevertheless accepted employment from the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and from April 1800 to 18 August 1801 Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the West, in the rebellious [[Vend\u00e9e]], and successfully restored its tranquility.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=931}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte proposed that Bernadotte head to New France to serve as governor of [[Louisiana]], which was to be transferred back to French control following the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. In accepting the position, Bernadotte requested additional soldiers, settlers, and funding to support the colony, but Napoleon refused. In response, Bernadotte, declined the posting and instead was named plenipotentiary ambassador to the United States. His posting was cancelled, however, after the [[Louisiana Purchase|Sale of Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite conference | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00974220/document | title = Bernadotte, Bonaparte, and Louisiana: the last dream of a French Empire in North America | first = Jean-Marc | last = Olivier | date = 2010 | editor-last = Belaubre | editor-first = Christope | editor-last2 = Dym | editor-first2 = Jordana | editor-last3 = Savage | editor-first3 = John | book-title = Napoleon's Atlantic: The Impact of Napoleonic Empire in the Atlantic World | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden, Netherlands | pages = 141\u201350 | format = PDF | isbn = 978-9004181540 | access-date = 11 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Marshal of the French Empire==\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte.jpg|180px|thumbnail|left|Bernadotte as a Marshal of the Empire]]On the introduction of the [[First French Empire]], Bernadotte became one of the eighteen [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshals of the Empire]], and from June 1804 to September 1805 served as governor of the recently occupied [[Hanover]]. In this capacity, as well as during his later command of the army of northern Germany, he created for himself a reputation for independence, incorruptibility, moderation, and administrative ability.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nDuring the campaign of 1805, Bernadotte, with his army corps from Hanover formed into the I Corps, commanded the Left Wing of the Grand Army overseeing Marmont's II Corps and having the majority of the Bavarian Army attached to his command; some 65,000 men or 1/4th of the Army. Bernadotte was also tasked with assuring France's newest ally, the Elector of Bavaria, [[Maximilian_I_Joseph_of_Bavaria|Maximillian Joseph]], that the Austrians would be driven from his country.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 150-151</ref><ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 106-109</ref>\n\nBernadotte, with Davout's III Corps attached to his command, and the Bavarians, gained a victory over the Austrians driving them out of Munich on October 12th, taking some 3000 prisoners and 19 guns and installing Maximillian Joseph back onto his throne.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 108-109</ref> I Corps then co-operated in the great movement which resulted in the shutting off of [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] in the Battle of [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]]. Bernadotte's troops then captured [[Salzburg]] on 30 October.<ref>Maude, F.A (1912) pp. 222-226</ref>\n\nIn the Battle of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (2 December 1805) he was posted with his corps in the center between [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] and [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]], and contributed to defeating the attempt of the right wing of the allies to outflank the French army.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} As a reward for his services at Austerlitz, he became the 1st Sovereign [[Prince]] of [[Ponte Corvo]] (5 June 1806), a district of Naples formerly subject to the Pope.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}}{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}\n\nHowever, during the campaign against [[Prussia]], in the same year, he was severely reproached by Napoleon for not participating with his army corps in the battles of [[Battle of Jena|Jena]] and [[Battle of Auerst\u00e4dt|Auerst\u00e4dt]] (14 October 1806).{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Napoleon, on the night of 13 October, thinking he had faced the whole Prussian army at Jena, sent orders to Bernadotte and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] to fall back from [[Naumburg]] and get across the Prussian line of retreat. In pursuance of these orders, Bernadotte, separately from Davout, left Naumburg at dawn on the morning of the 14th for [[Dornburg]] and marched towards [[Apolda]], which he reached by 16:00. Hampered by the very poor state of the roads, he could not engage in the Battle of Jena, though he effectively compelled the Prussians to retreat from both battlefields by posting his troops on the heights of Apolda.{{sfn|Titeux, Eugene|1903|pp=86\u2013104}}{{sfn|Foucart, Paul Jean|1887|pp=694\u201397}}{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|pp=758, 764\u201365}}\nAfterwards, Bernadotte was accused of deliberately refusing to support Davout, who had unexpectedly encountered the Prussian main army at Auerst\u00e4dt, out of jealousy, and Napoleon, if reminiscences from St. Helena may be believed, once intended to put Bernadotte before a court-martial.{{sfn|Favier, Franck|2010|pp=137\u201339}}{{sfn|Palmer, Alan|1990|p=135}} In fact, he did what he had been ordered to do, and more fundamental responsibility for his absence rests upon the ambiguous and indirect orders issued by Berthier and Napoleon's unawareness of the Prussian position.{{sfn|Alison, Sir Archibald|1836|p=765}}{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Jena, Bernadotte crushed the Prussian Reserve Army, all fresh troops fortified behind a marsh and the River Saale, under [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1758\u20131822)|Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg]] at [[Battle of Halle|Halle]] (17 October 1806), though Imperial Headquarters did not much appreciate this victory.<ref>Barton, Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 193</ref> When visiting Halle after the battle, and commenting on the degree of difficulty of storming a fortified position accessible only by a single bridge, Napoleon enigmatically commented \"Bernadotte stops at nothing. Someday the Gascon will get caught.\"<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 135</ref> Subsequently, Bernadotte pursued, conjointly with Soult and [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] (known as the \"Pursuit of the Three Marshals\"), Prussian general [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher's]] Corps to [[Battle of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]], where his troops stormed the Prussian defenses, taking the city<ref>Barton, D.

The impressed Swedes went home with a tale of Bernadotte's fairness in maintaining order within the city.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 136\u201337</ref>\n\nThereafter he marched to Poland in command of the French Left Wing, composed of his I Corps and Ney's VI Corps. Left unsupported by Ney's unexpected movement toward [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], the Russians under [[Levin August von Bennigsen]], passed over to the offensive and attempted to destroy Bernadotte's and Ney's isolated Corps.<ref>Barton, D.

As a consequence, Bernadotte's I Corps was too far away to take part in the [[Battle of Eylau]] (7 to 8 February 1807). Napoleon rebuked him for his absence but it became acknowledged that it was not due to Bernadotte, but Berthier's carelessness in dispatching the orderly.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). pp. 140\u201341</ref> The Russians resumed the offensive that summer and Bernadotte was attacked by, and defeated, a strong Prussian Corps at  [[Battle of Guttstadt-Deppen|Spanden]], preserving the French bridgehead over the [[Pas\u0142\u0119ka]], where he was nearly killed when a spent ball struck him in the neck.<ref>Barton, D.

However, Bernadotte maintained strict discipline amongst his troops and his good treatment of the Danes made him popular with the populace and Danish Royal Family. Upon his departure from Denmark he was one of few Frenchmen of the period to be awarded the [[Order of the Elephant]].<ref>Barton, pp. 194\u201396</ref>\n\nDuring Bernadotte's time as governor of the Hanseatic cities, the [[Abdications of Bayonne]] occurred, an event that triggered the [[Peninsular War]] that would play so large a role in Napoleon's defeat. For a time Napoleon considered the notion of placing Bernadotte on the Spanish throne; going so far as to hint at it in a letter to him. However, Bernadotte made it known to Napoleon that he didn't want the Spanish Crown.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921) pp. 192\u201393.</ref> [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Bernadotte's friend and brother-in-law, was chosen instead. It was not the first, or last time, that Napoleon thought of placing Bernadotte on a foreign throne. Indeed, Napoleon on several occasions, both during his days as First Consul and then as Emperor, thought of naming Bernadotte (Napoleon also considered Murat) as his successor by adoption. Despite their rivalry, Napoleon felt that Bernadotte alone had the popularity, administrative and military skill to safeguard the Empire he had built. However, the birth of the [[Napoleon II|King of Rome]] put an end to Napoleon's need for an heir.<ref>Ibid. p. 209.</ref> Ironically, Bernadotte did eventually wear a crown, not through the auspices of Napoleon, but as an enemy of France.<ref>Ibid, pp. 192\u201395</ref>\n\nBeing recalled to Germany to assist in the new war between France and Austria, he received the command of the 9th Corps, which was mainly composed of [[Saxony|Saxons]].{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}}  Further difficulties with Berthier, and being saddled with ill-prepared Saxons, combined with an illness, compelled Bernadotte to beg for release from service.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|p=284}} Bernadotte wrote to Napoleon that \"I see my efforts perpetually paralyzed by a hidden force over which I can not prevail.\"{{sfn|Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket |1930|pp=216\u201317}} Napoleon disregarded these appeals and Bernadotte proceeded with the campaign, commanding mostly foreign troops with few French troops under his command.{{sfn|Scott, Franklin D.|1962|pp=284\u201385}}\nAt the [[Battle of Wagram]] (5 July 1809), he entered battle with his Saxon corps, to which the division of [[Pierre-Louis Dupas|Dupas]] was attached and which formed his reserve. Resting on the French Left, Bernadotte's corps was battered during the night but resisted the full fury of the Austrian attack facing superior numbers. At a critical moment he ordered Dupas forward to his support; the latter replied that he had orders from the emperor to remain where he was. Having been badly mauled, and fully exposed ahead of the main French line, IX Corps withdrew from the village of Aderklaa against Napoleon's orders. On the second day of battle, 6 July 1809, IX Corps, having been mauled the night before, wherein Bernadotte struggled to rally his demoralized Saxons, was attacked by two Austrian corps, as part of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles's]] effort to break the French line. This time Bernadotte's depleted forces - he had only 6,000 infantry left - broke and fled (Bernadotte's Corps was not the only one to have broken that day, Mass\u00e9na's troops were also routed by the attack). The routed Saxons retreated in disorder toward Raasdorf as Bernadotte attempted to rally his men, where he encountered Napoleon. IX Corps rallied and played a further role in the battle. Rumors that Napoleon relieved Bernadotte of command on the spot at Raasdorf have long been the stuff of legend, but are not verified.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 223\u201325.</ref> After the battle, Bernadotte complained to Napoleon for having, in violation of all military rules, ordered Dupas to act independently of his command, and for having thereby caused great loss of life to the Saxons, and tendered his resignation. Napoleon accepted after he had become aware of an order of the day issued by Bernadotte in which he gave the Saxons credit for their courage in terms inconsistent with the emperor's official bulletin.{{sfn|The American Cyclop\u00e6dia |1879|p=571}} Accounts of Bernadotte's role at Wagram are contradictory. While it is true that IX Corps broke on 6 July, as did other French formations, they later rallied and played a part in the victory. Moreover, Bernadotte fought with exceptional personal courage, at the head of his troops, and narrowly averted death when attacked by Austrian cavalry. It is likely that IX Corps' poor performance would have been forgotten, and Bernadotte would have retained his command, had he never published the controversial Order of the Day.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 227\u201328.</ref> However, Bernadotte's praise for the Saxons, as well as his mild and courteous treatment of them while under his command, was never forgotten by the Saxon officers and this would later have disastrous consequences for the French when a whole Saxon division defected to Bernadotte's Army of the North during a key moment of the [[Battle of Leipzig]].<ref>Smith, Digby (2001). pp. 225\u201329</ref>\n\nWith Bernadotte having returned to Paris, the [[Walcheren Campaign]] (July 1809) caused the French ministry in the absence of the emperor to entrust him with the defense of [[Antwerp]] with both regular French and Dutch troops along with the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]].<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 153</ref> Bernadotte, with his customary skill, took command of a chaotic situation wherein troops from all over the Empire and its vassal states, and raw conscripts, were sent to Holland under divided command. He re-organized and trained his forces, named by the Emperor as the Army of Antwerp, by instilling discipline in old soldiers too long at the depots and teaching raw conscripts their trade. Everywhere he instilled a fighting spirit, making an army out of a mob, and thus he rapidly brought the defenses of Antwerp to a high order of readiness.<ref>Barton, Plunkett (1921). pp. 237\u201340</ref> With Antwerp bristling with cannon and numerous defenders, and with the Army of Antwerp whipped into fighting shape, the British, vexed by poor leadership and with half the army immobilized with fever thanks to the insalubrious islands upon which they were quartered, realized that it was no longer possible to close the [[Scheldt]], or take Antwerp, and withdrew their forces.<ref>Howard, Martin (2012). pp. 139\u201347.</ref> In a proclamation issued to his troops at Antwerp he made an implied charge against Napoleon of having neglected to prepare the proper means of defense for the Belgian coast.

He was 61 years old and in poor health. He was also childless; [[Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Queen Charlotte]] had given birth to two children who had died in infancy, and there was no prospect of her bearing another child.

However, Eug\u00e8ne, serving as viceroy in Italy, did not wish to convert to Lutheranism, a prerequisite for accepting the Swedish offer. Moreover, none of Napoleon's brothers was interested in going to Sweden and his nephews were too young, as the Swedes did not want the hazards of minority rule in the event King Charles died prematurely.<ref>Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). pp. 250\u201356, 268\u201372.</ref> The matter was decided by an obscure Swedish courtier, son of Baron Gustav M\u00f6rner, a commander of the Swedish force captured by Bernadotte at L\u00fcbeck, Baron [[Karl Otto M\u00f6rner]], who, entirely on his own initiative, offered the succession to the Swedish crown to Bernadotte.

The keynote of his whole policy was the acquisition of Norway as a compensation for the loss of Finland and Bernadotte proved anything but a puppet of France.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=932}} Many Swedes expected him to reconquer Finland, which had been ceded to Russia; however, the Crown Prince was aware of its difficulty for reasons of the desperate situation of the state finance and the reluctance of the Finnish people to return to Sweden.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). p. 39</ref> Even if Finland was regained, he thought, it would put Sweden into a new cycle of conflicts with a powerful neighbor because there was no guarantee Russia would accept the loss as final.<ref>Palmer, Alan (1990). p. 181</ref> Therefore, he made up his mind to make a united [[Scandinavian Peninsula|Scandinavian peninsula]], which was easier to defend, by taking Norway (intentionally without the ancient and remote provinces of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]) from Denmark and uniting her to Sweden.

This demand would mean a hard blow to the national economy and the Swedish population. Sweden reluctantly declared war against Great Britain but it was treated by both countries as being merely nominal, although Swedish imports of British goods decreased from \u00a34,871 million in 1810 to \u00a3523 million in the following year.<ref>Berdah, Jean-Francois (2009). pp. 40\u201341</ref><ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 259</ref>\n\nIn January 1812, French troops suddenly invaded [[Swedish Pomerania]] and the [[island of R\u00fcgen]].<ref>Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunket (1930). p. 265</ref> The decisive reason was that Napoleon, before marching to Moscow, had to secure his rear and dared not trust a Swedish continental foothold behind him.<ref name=\"Scott, Franklin D.1988.

He tells the story of his experience of love in a flashback. A few years ago, in [[London]], a chance meeting in a disco between Ayan, the son of a millionaire, a novice in terms of sex-related matters, and Alizeh Khan ([[Anushka Sharma]]), who knows about sex a little more, ends up with them trying to make out, and it turning into a comedy. They get to know about each other and become friends. Later, when they discover their respective partners are cheating on them, they break up with their lovers: Ayan with Lisa D'Souza and Alizeh with \"Dr.\" Faisal Khan and the two go to Paris to spend a week together. While Ayan falls in love with Alizeh but does not tell her while she considers him to be only a \"friend\". One day, Alizeh stumbles upon DJ Ali, her ex-boyfriend/lover, who wants to reconcile. Partially confused, but still in love with him, Alizeh decides to go with DJ Ali, and so unintentionally stops hanging out with Ayan and they cease communication.\n\nA few days later, Alizeh calls and invites Ayan to her wedding with DJ Ali in [[Lucknow]]. Ayan is petrified on hearing this but agrees to the invitation. At the wedding, he tells Alizeh he loves her but she rejects his feelings causing Ayan to leave the ceremony heartbroken. At the airport to board a flight to [[Dubai]], he meets Saba Taliyar Khan ([[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]]), a poet, who is leaving for [[Vienna]]. She consoles Ayan and gives him a book with her poetry and number on it. Ayan calls after three months stating that he is in Vienna and wants to meet her. He learns that Saba is divorced and has no place for love in her heart. Later, he also meets Saba's ex-husband, Tahir Taliyar Khan ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) in a fine arts gallery, who tells him that one-sided love is not a weakness but empowering. Ayan, who had blocked Alizeh from contacting him in all ways, finally calls and reconnects with her. He begins to send pictures of Saba to her to try and induce jealousy.\n\nOne day Alizeh informs Ayan that she's coming to Vienna and wants to meet him. Ayan invites her for dinner with Saba to provoke Alizeh into loving him, but Alizeh thinks Ayan has found love in Saba and is happy for him. Meanwhile, Saba begins to develop feelings for Ayan, but he loves Alizeh. Seeing his love for Alizeh, Saba asks him to leave.\n\nAyan continues to harbor love for Alizeh and becomes a famous singer with his channel. He meets Ali one day and realizes that Ali and Alizeh  have parted ways. Ayan goes to Alizeh's favorite spot and waits there until she arrives. Alizeh tells Ayan that she is diagnosed with cancer stage IV and will not live much longer. Ayan and Alizeh try to make the best of their time together. Ayan tries to make Alizeh love him, to no avail. This leads to a fight between the two, and Alizeh decides to leave Ayan. Next morning Ayan tries to search for Alizeh, apparently reaching the airport and thus fulfilling her last wish also before death. Eventually, Ayan makes peace with the fact that he and Alizeh can at least be friends and nothing more. Alizeh dies soon. The screen blacks out and comes back to the present where Ayan, still a popular singer, is giving an interview based on the love of his life. Ayan sings the song ''\"[[Channa Mereya]]\"'', which is inspired by his one-sided love story, and finishes the interview.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main cast===\n* [[Ranbir Kapoor]] as Ayan Sanger\n* [[Anushka Sharma]] as Alizeh Khan\n* [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] as Saba Taliyar Khan\n*[[Fawad Khan]] as DJ Ali\n\n===Cameo appearances===\n*[[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Tahir Taliyar Khan, Saba's ex-husband\n* [[Imran Abbas]] as Dr. Faisal Khan, Alizeh's boyfriend\n* [[Lisa Haydon]] as Lisa D'Souza, Ayan's girlfriend\n* [[Alia Bhatt]] as Nisha (Alizeh's DJ friend) in the song \"The Breakup Song\"\n*[[Neha Dhupia]] as the reporter (voiceover)\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n{{Quote box\n |quote=\"...it is not a conventional love story or love triangle.

When he came back to India, he spoke to the three lead actors and they all signed on immediately.

Citing the casting of Pakistani actor [[Fawad Khan]] in the film, the MNS warned theater owners around the country to not screen the film, threatening them with vandalism. Announcing that security will be tightened at theaters along with sufficient police protection, Maharashtra chief minister, [[Devendra Fadnavis]], commented on the issue, saying, \"Anyone found taking the law into their hands will be dealt with firmly.\" He also informed that 12 MNS members were sent to judicial custody after they barged into a Mumbai theater and held a protest on 19 October 2016.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Cops-set-up-helpline-for-movie-theatres-as-MNS-threat-looms/articleshow/54948796.cms MNS: Ae Dil Hai Mushkil: Cops set up helpline for movie theatres as MNS threat looms \u2013 Times of India].

But with that same energy, I beseech you to know one thing \u2013 that over 300 people in my Indian crew have put their blood, sweat, and tears into making my film, ''Ae Dil Hai Mushkil''.

He tells the story of his experience of love in a flashback. A few years ago, in [[London]], a chance meeting in a disco between Ayan, the son of a millionaire, a novice in terms of sex-related matters, and Alizeh Khan ([[Anushka Sharma]]), who knows about sex a little more, ends up with them trying to make out, and it turning into a comedy. They get to know about each other and become friends. Later, when they discover their respective partners are cheating on them, they break up with their lovers: Ayan with Lisa D'Souza and Alizeh with \"Dr.\" Faisal Khan and the two go to Paris to spend a week together. While Ayan falls in love with Alizeh but does not tell her while she considers him to be only a \"friend\". One day, Alizeh stumbles upon DJ Ali, her ex-boyfriend/lover, who wants to reconcile. Partially confused, but still in love with him, Alizeh decides to go with DJ Ali, and so unintentionally stops hanging out with Ayan and they cease communication.\n\nA few days later, Alizeh calls and invites Ayan to her wedding with DJ Ali in [[Lucknow]]. Ayan is petrified on hearing this but agrees to the invitation. At the wedding, he tells Alizeh he loves her but she rejects his feelings causing Ayan to leave the ceremony heartbroken. At the airport to board a flight to [[Dubai]], he meets Saba Taliyar Khan ([[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]]), a poet, who is leaving for [[Vienna]]. She consoles Ayan and gives him a book with her poetry and number on it. Ayan calls after three months stating that he is in Vienna and wants to meet her. He learns that Saba is divorced and has no place for love in her heart. Later, he also meets Saba's ex-husband, Tahir Taliyar Khan ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) in a fine arts gallery, who tells him that one-sided love is not a weakness but empowering. Ayan, who had blocked Alizeh from contacting him in all ways, finally calls and reconnects with her. He begins to send pictures of Saba to her to try and induce jealousy.\n\nOne day Alizeh informs Ayan that she's coming to Vienna and wants to meet him. Ayan invites her for dinner with Saba to provoke Alizeh into loving him, but Alizeh thinks Ayan has found love in Saba and is happy for him. Meanwhile, Saba begins to develop feelings for Ayan, but he loves Alizeh. Seeing his love for Alizeh, Saba asks him to leave.\n\nAyan continues to harbor love for Alizeh and becomes a famous singer with his channel. He meets Ali one day and realizes that Ali and Alizeh  have parted ways. Ayan goes to Alizeh's favorite spot and waits there until she arrives. Alizeh tells Ayan that she is diagnosed with [[Cancer staging|cancer stage IV]] and will not live much longer. Ayan and Alizeh try to make the best of their time together. Ayan tries to make Alizeh love him, to no avail. This leads to a fight between the two, and Alizeh decides to leave Ayan. Next morning Ayan tries to search for Alizeh, apparently reaching the airport and thus fulfilling her last wish also before death. Eventually, Ayan makes peace with the fact that he and Alizeh can at least be friends and nothing more. Alizeh dies soon. The screen blacks out and comes back to the present where Ayan, still a popular singer, is giving an interview based on the love of his life. Ayan sings the song ''\"Channa Mereya\"'', which is inspired by his one-sided love story, and finishes the interview.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main cast===\n* [[Ranbir Kapoor]] as Ayan Sanger\n* [[Anushka Sharma]] as Alizeh Khan\n* [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] as Saba Taliyar Khan\n*[[Fawad Khan]] as DJ Ali\n\n===Cameo appearances===\n*[[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Tahir Taliyar Khan, Saba's ex-husband\n* [[Imran Abbas]] as Dr. Faisal Khan, Alizeh's boyfriend\n* [[Lisa Haydon]] as Lisa D'Souza, Ayan's girlfriend\n* [[Alia Bhatt]] as Nisha (Alizeh's DJ friend) in the song \"The Breakup Song\"\n*[[Neha Dhupia]] as the reporter (voiceover)\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n{{Quote box\n |quote=\"...it is not a conventional love story or love triangle.

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.
