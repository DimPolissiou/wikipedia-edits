The Ranger spacecraft were designed to take images of the lunar surface, transmitting those images to Earth until the spacecraft were destroyed upon impact. Burke was in charge of spacecraft design, deep space tracking and control network, space flight operations and data reduction support systems, while the Space Science Division was in charge of the scientific experiments.\nBurke could combine the technological and theoretical to integrate mechanical and electrical features to achieve the difficult technical objectives. Along with his two associates, Burke had solved the major guidance problem, velocity control, associated with solid-propellant ballistic missiles.

Steven Bogos of ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' positively referred to the game as \"Banjo-Threeie\", calling it \"a nostalgic ride through time, bringing the collect-a-thons from the N64 era into the modern age\".<ref name=\"escapereview\"/> James Kozanitis of [[Game Revolution]] felt that ''Yooka-Laylee'' improved on the gameplay and structure of classic titles, in particular the relevance and importance of the collectables.<ref name=\"gamerevreview\"/> Chris Carter of ''[[Destructoid]]'' praised the expansive levels and the colorful design, but concluded that due to the throwback designs, it would not be for everyone.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Marty Sliva of [[IGN]] called ''Yooka-Laylee'' \"a good reminder that this genre, once thought to be dead, still has some life left in it\". He also noted different aspects of the game that felt authentic to games from the 90s, praising the level design, soundtrack and characters while also criticizing how the game controlled at certain points and stated it was \"not 1998 anymore\" regarding frustrating camera movement.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Kallie Plagge of [[GameSpot]] similarly praised certain aspects such as the collectibles and non-linear structure, while also criticizing the uncooperative camera and in some instances convoluted level design.<ref name=\"GSpot\"/>\n\nOn the other hand, Colm Ahern was more negative about the game's intention to capitalize on people's nostalgia, especially noting \"camera issues, ambiguous puzzles, a distinct lack of signposting, and voices that will make your ears bleed\",<ref name=\"VG\"/> while the game itself could not decide whether it was aiming at children or adults as an audience.

Steven Bogos of ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' positively referred to the game as \"Banjo-Threeie\", calling it \"a nostalgic ride through time, bringing the collect-a-thons from the N64 era into the modern age\".<ref name=\"escapereview\"/> James Kozanitis of [[Game Revolution]] felt that ''Yooka-Laylee'' improved on the gameplay and structure of classic titles, in particular the relevance and importance of the collectables.<ref name=\"gamerevreview\"/> Chris Carter of ''[[Destructoid]]'' praised the expansive levels and the colorful design, but concluded that due to the throwback designs, it would not be for everyone.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Marty Sliva of [[IGN]] called ''Yooka-Laylee'' \"a good reminder that this genre, once thought to be dead, still has some life left in it\". He also noted different aspects of the game that felt authentic to games from the 90s, praising the level design, soundtrack and characters while also criticizing how the game controlled at certain points and stated it was \"not 1998 anymore\" regarding frustrating camera movement.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Kallie Plagge of [[GameSpot]] similarly praised certain aspects such as the collectibles and non-linear structure, while also criticizing the uncooperative camera and in some instances convoluted level design.<ref name=\"GSpot\"/>\n\nOn the other hand, Colm Ahern was more negative about the game's intention to capitalize on people's nostalgia, especially noting \"camera issues, ambiguous puzzles, a distinct lack of signposting, and voices that will make your ears bleed\",<ref name=\"VG\"/> while the game itself could not decide whether it was aiming at children or adults as an audience. Furthermore, while he was positive about the first level, he claimed that all other levels in the game were falling short, finding them repetitive and confusing.<ref name=\"VG\"/> Chelsea Stark of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' noted that ''Yooka-Laylee'' was \"proof that sometimes our fondest memories should stay in the past\".<ref name=\"Polygon\"/> She called the game's combat mechanics \"a chore\" and was critical of the controls.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/> [[GamesRadar]] also noted the game's repetitive missions and objectives, with reviewer David Houghton noting that some of the game's power-ups, especially the flight ability, render most puzzles and level design choices obsolete.<ref name=\"GRadar\"/>\n\n==Spin-off and other appearances==\nA spin-off, ''[[Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair]]'', was announced on June 2019. In contrast to its predecessor, the game is set in [[2.5D]] levels resembling those of the ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' series, although it does contain a 3D overworld.

The dispute lasted from 26 August 1913 to 18 January 1914, and is often viewed as the most severe and significant industrial dispute in [[History of Ireland|Irish history]]. Central to the dispute was the workers' [[Labor rights|right to unionise]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Dublin slums===\n\nIrish workers lived in terrible conditions in [[tenement]]s. For example, an astonishing 835 people lived in 15 houses in Henrietta Street's Georgian tenements. At number 10, Henrietta Street, the [[Religious Sisters of Charity|Irish Sisters of Charity]] ran a [[Magdalene Laundries in Ireland|laundry]] inhabited by more than 50 single women.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/exhibition/dublin/poverty_health.html |title=Exhibition - Poverty and Health |publisher=[[National Archives of Ireland]] |accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref> An estimated four million pledges were taken in pawnbrokers every year. The [[infant mortality rate]] among the poor was 142 per 1,000 births, extraordinarily high for a European city. The situation was made considerably worse by the high rate of disease in the slums, which was the result of a lack of health care and cramped living conditions, among other things. The most prevalent disease in the Dublin slums at this time was [[tuberculosis]] (TB), which spread through tenements very quickly and caused many deaths amongst the poor. A report, published in 1912, found that TB-related deaths in Ireland were 50% higher than in England or [[Scotland]]. The vast majority of TB-related deaths in Ireland occurred among the poorer classes. This updated a 1903 study by Dr [[John Lumsden]].\n\nPoverty was perpetuated in Dublin by the lack of work for unskilled workers, who lacked any form of representation before trade unions were founded. These unskilled workers often had to compete with one another for work every day, the job generally going to whoever agreed to work for the lowest wages.\n\n===Jim Larkin and the formation of the ITGWU===\n[[James Larkin]], the main protagonist on the side of the workers in the dispute, was a [[Stevedore|docker]] in Liverpool and a union organiser. In 1907, he was sent to [[Belfast]] as local organiser of the British-based [[National Union of Dock Labourers]] (NUDL). While in Belfast, Larkin organised [[Belfast Dock Strike, 1907|a strike of dock and transport workers]]. It was also in Belfast that Larkin began to use the tactic of the [[sympathetic strike]], in which workers, who were not directly involved in an industrial dispute with employers, would go on strike in support of other workers who were. The Belfast strike was moderately successful and boosted Larkin's standing among Irish workers. However, his tactics were highly controversial and, as a result, Larkin was transferred to Dublin.\n\nUnskilled workers in Dublin were very much at the mercy of their employers. Employers who suspected workers of trying to organise themselves, could [[Blacklisting|blacklist]] them, destroying any chance of future employment. Larkin set about organising the unskilled workers of Dublin: this was a cause of concern for the NUDL, who were reluctant to engage in a full-scale industrial dispute with the powerful Dublin employers. They suspended Larkin from the NUDL in 1908. Larkin then left the NUDL and set up an Irish union, the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]] (ITGWU).\n\nThe ITGWU was the first Irish trade union to cater for both skilled and unskilled workers. In its first few months, it quickly gained popularity, and soon spread to other Irish cities. The ITGWU was used as a vehicle for Larkin's [[syndicalist]] views. He believed in bringing about a socialist revolution by the establishment of trade unions and calling [[general strike]]s.\n\nIt initially lost several strikes between 1908 and 1910, but, after 1911, the union won strikes involving carters and railway workers, for example, the [[1913 Sligo Dock strike|1913 Sligo dock strike]]. Between 1911 and 1913, membership of the ITGWU rose from 4,000 to 10,000, to the alarm of employers.\n\nLarkin had learned from the methods of the 1910 [[Tonypandy riots]] and the [[1911 Liverpool general transport strike]] \u2013 both savagely suppressed by [[Winston Churchill|Winston Churchill's]] police and army.\n\n===Connolly and the Irish Labour Party===\nAnother important figure in the rise of an organised workers' movement in Ireland at this time, was [[James Connolly]], an Edinburgh-born [[Marxist]] of Irish parentage. Connolly was a talented orator and a fine writer. He became known for his speeches on the streets of Dublin in support of socialism and Irish nationalism. In 1896, Connolly established the [[Irish Socialist Republican Party]], and the newspaper ''The Workers' Republic''. In 1911, Connolly was appointed the ITGWU's Belfast organiser. In 1912, Connolly and [[James Larkin|Larkin]] formed the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]] to represent workers in the imminent [[Home Rule Act 1914|Home Rule Bill]] debate in [[British Parliament|Parliament]]. Home Rule, although passed in the House of Commons, was postponed, due to the start of [[World War I]] and the collapse of [[H.H. Asquith|HH Asquith's]] [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government due to the disaster of Churchill's [[Gallipoli Campaign|invasion of Gallipoli]] in 1915. The Home Rule plan was then suspended for one year, then indefinitely, after the rise of [[Irish Republicanism|militant nationalism]] following the [[1916 Rising]].\n\n===William Martin Murphy and the employers===\n[[File:Vulture of dartry hall.jpg|thumb|Cartoon of [[William Martin Murphy|William M. Murphy]] preying over [[James Larkin|Jim Larkin]]. ]] Furthermore in Ireland among employers opposed to trade unions such as Larkin's ITGWU, was [[William Martin Murphy]], Ireland's most prominent capitalist, born in Castletownbere Co Cork. In 1913, Murphy was chairman of the [[Dublin United Tramway Company]] and owned Clery's department store and the Imperial Hotel.  He controlled the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', ''[[Evening Herald]]'' and ''[[Irish Catholic]]'' newspapers and was a major shareholder in the [[B&I Line]]. Murphy was also a prominent [[Irish Nationalism|nationalist]] and a former [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Home Rule]] MP in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]].\n\nEven today, his defenders insist he was a charitable man and a good employer, and that his workers received fair wages. Yet conditions in his many enterprises were often poor or worse, with employees given only one day off in 10 while being forced to labour up to 17 hours a day. Dublin tramway workers were paid substantially less than their counterparts in Belfast and Liverpool, and were subjected to a regime of punitive fines, probationary periods extending for as long as six years, and a culture of company surveillance, involving widespread use of informers.<ref>''Rebel City- Larkin, Connolly and the Dublin Labour Movement'', by John Newsinger, Merlin Press Ltd 2004</ref>\n\nMurphy was not opposed in principle to trade unions, particularly craft unions, but he was vehemently opposed to the ITGWU, seeing its leader, Larkin, as a dangerous revolutionary.<ref>Morrissey, Thomas, ''William Martin Murphy'', 1997</ref>  In July 1913, Murphy presided over a meeting of 300 employers, during which a collective response to the rise of trade unionism was agreed. Murphy and the employers were determined not to allow the ITGWU to unionise the Dublin workforce.

approximately 20,000 workers and 300 employers which took place in Ireland's capital city of [[Dublin]]. The dispute lasted from 26 August 1913 to 18 January 1914, and is often viewed as the most severe and significant industrial dispute in [[History of Ireland|Irish history]]. Central to the dispute was the workers' [[Labor rights|right to unionise]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Dublin slums===\n\nIrish workers lived in terrible conditions in [[tenement]]s. For example, an astonishing 835 people lived in 15 houses in Henrietta Street's Georgian tenements. At number 10, Henrietta Street, the [[Religious Sisters of Charity|Irish Sisters of Charity]] ran a [[Magdalene Laundries in Ireland|laundry]] inhabited by more than 50 single women.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/exhibition/dublin/poverty_health.html |title=Exhibition - Poverty and Health |publisher=[[National Archives of Ireland]] |accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref> An estimated four million pledges were taken in pawnbrokers every year. The [[infant mortality rate]] among the poor was 142 per 1,000 births, extraordinarily high for a European city. The situation was made considerably worse by the high rate of disease in the slums, which was the result of a lack of health care and cramped living conditions, among other things. The most prevalent disease in the Dublin slums at this time was [[tuberculosis]] (TB), which spread through tenements very quickly and caused many deaths amongst the poor. A report, published in 1912, found that TB-related deaths in Ireland were 50% higher than in England or [[Scotland]]. The vast majority of TB-related deaths in Ireland occurred among the poorer classes. This updated a 1903 study by Dr [[John Lumsden]].\n\nPoverty was perpetuated in Dublin by the lack of work for unskilled workers, who lacked any form of representation before trade unions were founded. These unskilled workers often had to compete with one another for work every day, the job generally going to whoever agreed to work for the lowest wages.\n\n===Jim Larkin and the formation of the ITGWU===\n[[James Larkin]], the main protagonist on the side of the workers in the dispute, was a [[Stevedore|docker]] in Liverpool and a union organiser. In 1907, he was sent to [[Belfast]] as local organiser of the British-based [[National Union of Dock Labourers]] (NUDL). While in Belfast, Larkin organised [[Belfast Dock Strike, 1907|a strike of dock and transport workers]]. It was also in Belfast that Larkin began to use the tactic of the [[sympathetic strike]], in which workers, who were not directly involved in an industrial dispute with employers, would go on strike in support of other workers who were. The Belfast strike was moderately successful and boosted Larkin's standing among Irish workers. However, his tactics were highly controversial and, as a result, Larkin was transferred to Dublin.\n\nUnskilled workers in Dublin were very much at the mercy of their employers. Employers who suspected workers of trying to organise themselves, could [[Blacklisting|blacklist]] them, destroying any chance of future employment. Larkin set about organising the unskilled workers of Dublin: this was a cause of concern for the NUDL, who were reluctant to engage in a full-scale industrial dispute with the powerful Dublin employers. They suspended Larkin from the NUDL in 1908. Larkin then left the NUDL and set up an Irish union, the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]] (ITGWU).\n\nThe ITGWU was the first Irish trade union to cater for both skilled and unskilled workers. In its first few months, it quickly gained popularity, and soon spread to other Irish cities. The ITGWU was used as a vehicle for Larkin's [[syndicalist]] views. He believed in bringing about a socialist revolution by the establishment of trade unions and calling [[general strike]]s.\n\nIt initially lost several strikes between 1908 and 1910, but, after 1911, the union won strikes involving carters and railway workers, for example, the [[1913 Sligo Dock strike|1913 Sligo dock strike]]. Between 1911 and 1913, membership of the ITGWU rose from 4,000 to 10,000, to the alarm of employers.\n\nLarkin had learned from the methods of the 1910 [[Tonypandy Riots]] and the [[1911 Liverpool general transport strike]] \u2013 both savagely suppressed by [[Winston Churchill|Winston Churchill's]] police and army.\n\n===Connolly and the Irish Labour Party===\nAnother important figure in the rise of an organised workers' movement in Ireland at this time, was [[James Connolly]], an Edinburgh-born [[Marxist]] of Irish parentage. Connolly was a talented orator and a fine writer. He became known for his speeches on the streets of Dublin in support of socialism and Irish nationalism. In 1896, Connolly established the [[Irish Socialist Republican Party]], and the newspaper ''The Workers' Republic''. In 1911, Connolly was appointed the ITGWU's Belfast organiser. In 1912, Connolly and [[James Larkin|Larkin]] formed the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]] to represent workers in the imminent [[Home Rule Act 1914|Home Rule Bill]] debate in [[British Parliament|Parliament]]. Home Rule, although passed in the House of Commons, was postponed, due to the start of [[World War I]] and the collapse of [[H.H. Asquith|HH Asquith's]] [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government due to the disaster of Churchill's [[Gallipoli Campaign|invasion of Gallipoli]] in 1915. The Home Rule plan was then suspended for one year, then indefinitely, after the rise of [[Irish Republicanism|militant nationalism]] following the [[1916 Rising]].\n\n===William Martin Murphy and the employers===\n[[File:Vulture of dartry hall.jpg|thumb|Cartoon of [[William Martin Murphy|William M. Murphy]] preying over [[James Larkin|Jim Larkin]]. ]] Furthermore in Ireland among employers opposed to trade unions such as Larkin's ITGWU, was [[William Martin Murphy]], Ireland's most prominent capitalist, born in Castletownbere Co Cork. In 1913, Murphy was chairman of the [[Dublin United Tramway Company]] and owned Clery's department store and the Imperial Hotel.  He controlled the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', ''[[Evening Herald]]'' and ''[[Irish Catholic]]'' newspapers and was a major shareholder in the [[B&I Line]]. Murphy was also a prominent [[Irish Nationalism|nationalist]] and a former [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Home Rule]] MP in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]].\n\nEven today, his defenders insist he was a charitable man and a good employer, and that his workers received fair wages. Yet conditions in his many enterprises were often poor or worse, with employees given only one day off in 10 while being forced to labour up to 17 hours a day. Dublin tramway workers were paid substantially less than their counterparts in Belfast and Liverpool, and were subjected to a regime of punitive fines, probationary periods extending for as long as six years, and a culture of company surveillance, involving widespread use of informers.<ref>''Rebel City- Larkin, Connolly and the Dublin Labour Movement'', by John Newsinger, Merlin Press Ltd 2004</ref>\n\nMurphy was not opposed in principle to trade unions, particularly craft unions, but he was vehemently opposed to the ITGWU, seeing its leader, Larkin, as a dangerous revolutionary.<ref>Morrissey, Thomas, ''William Martin Murphy'', 1997</ref>  In July 1913, Murphy presided over a meeting of 300 employers, during which a collective response to the rise of trade unionism was agreed. Murphy and the employers were determined not to allow the ITGWU to unionise the Dublin workforce. On 15 August, Murphy dismissed 40 workers he suspected of ITGWU membership, followed by another 300 over the next week.\n\n==Course of the dispute==\n[[File:Big-Jim-Larkin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Statue of James Larkin on O'Connell Street ([[Ois\u00edn Kelly]] 1977)]]\n\n===Escalation===\nThe resulting industrial dispute was the most severe in [[History of Ireland|Ireland's history]].

This flag was simply the [[United States flag]] with a Lone star in the [[Canton (flag)|canton]]. This flag echoes an earlier design, carried by the forces of [[James Long (filibuster)|James Long]] in failed 1819 and 1821 attempts to separate Texas from Spanish control. This earlier flag was exactly the same, save for the canton having a red background rather than blue. There is evidence that the Lone Star and Stripes was used at the battles of Goliad, the Alamo, and San Jacinto, and the first Congress of the Republic of Texas as convened under it in 1836. Although interim President David Burnet issued a decree making the Lone Star and Stripes the first official flag of the Republic of Texas, it never became the legal national flag. It did remain the naval flag of Texas until annexation, and was noted for being \"beneficial to our [Texan] Navy and Merchantmen\" due to its resemblance to the U.S. flag. Despite its unofficial status, the flag remained well known inside the region and internationally as the symbol of Texas. The official blue and gold \"Burnett Flag,\" on the other hand, was little known by Texans, and no contemporary illustrations of it have been discovered except for on the first series 2 dollar note of the Texas Dollar. An 1837 chart of national flags printed in Philadelphia showed the Lone Star and Stripes as the national flag of Texas, and Texas Senator Oliver Jones, who led the 1839 committee which approved the Lone Star Flag, was unaware that the Lone Star and Stripes was not the current official flag.<ref>{{cite book | last=Maberry | first=Robert, Jr.| title=Texas Flags|publisher=Texas A&M University Press |year=2001|isbn=978-1-58544-151-8|location=College Station|pages=28\u201338}}</ref> Later, prior to the [[American Civil War]], this flag was carried by Floridian militiamen in Pensacola during the seizure of U.S. property in that city.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe \"Come and Take It Flag\" was created by the people of Gonzales, featuring the phrase, a black five pointed star, and the image of the town cannon Mexican forces had demanded they turn over. In March 1831, Juan Gomez, a lieutenant in the Mexican Army, granted a small cannon to the colony of San Antonio. It was then transported to Gonzales, Texas and later was the object of Texas pride. At the minor skirmish known as the [[Battle of Gonzales]], a small group of Texans successfully resisted the Mexican forces who had orders to seize their cannon. As a symbol of defiance, the Texans had fashioned a flag containing the phrase along with a black star and an image of the cannon which they had received six years earlier from Mexican officials.\n\nThe so-called \"Alamo Flag\" or \"1824 flag\" was created by replacing the Eagle in the center of the Mexican tricolor with the year \"1824,\" referencing the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]], in support of which Texas was fighting. This was the first flag approved for use by rebel forces by a Texan legislative body. In 1835, the Texan provisional government approved the use of this flag for privateers preying on Mexican commerce.  It has often been said that the 1824 flag was flown by Texan forces at the [[Battle of the Alamo]]. However, this was never alleged until 1860, long after the battle had occurred. Modern writers have pointed out that the presence of the 1824 flag at the time and place of the battle is highly unlikely. A similar flag was flown at least briefly by Texan Tejano forces, featuring two black, six pointed stars in place of the date. It is likely that the actual \"Alamo flag\" referred to by accounts of the time was the Lone Star and Stripes, which had been depicted in use at earlier battles such as Goliad, and was widely referred to as the \"[[Texian]] flag.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=Maberry | first=Robert, Jr.| title=Texas Flags |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |year=2001|isbn=978-1-58544-151-8|location=College Station|pages=11, 26, 28\u201332}}</ref>\n\nThe Dodson Tricolor or Dodson flag was designed and sewn by a Mrs. Sarah Dodson during the Revolution. It resembled the flag of Revolutionary France, but with longer proportions and the Texan Lone Star in the canton. [[Stephen F. Austin]] was initially so alarmed by the obvious symbolism that he requested the flag not be used, but it nevertheless flew over Texan forces in [[Cibolo Creek]], and may have been the first Texan flag raised over San Antonio. The flag was one of two that flew over the small cabin in which Texas delegates ratified their declaration of independence.\n\n===Republic of Texas flags===\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Flag of Republic of Texas (1836-1839).svg|{{FIAV|historical}}{{FIAV|111000}}1836\u20131839; 1839\u20131879 {{FIAV|001000}} <br> The \"Burnet Flag,\" used from 1836 to 1839 as the national flag of the [[Republic of Texas]] until it was replaced by the currently used \"Lone Star Flag\"; it was the ''de jure'' war flag from then until 1879\nFile:Flag of the Republic of Texas (1835-1839).svg|{{FIAV|historical}}{{FIAV|000001}}1836\u20131839 <br> War ensign and ''de facto'' national flag between 1835\u20131839; it was also the ensign of the First [[Texas Navy]] from 1836\u20131839; it was prominently featured on the $10 and $50 notes of the [[Texas dollar]]\nFile:Flag of Texas.svg|1839\u20131845/6 <br> The \"Lone Star Flag,\" the [[Republic of Texas]] national flag from 1839-1845/6; official naval ensign for the [[Texas Navy]] from 1839\nFile:Texas Revenue Service Flag (1839-1845).svg|1839\u20131845 <br> Revenue Service flag\nFile:Texas Coasting Trader Flag (1839-1845).svg|1839\u20131845 <br> Coasting Trader ensign\nFile:Texas Pilot Flag (1839-1845).svg|1839\u20131845 <br> Pilot flag/Civil ensign\n</gallery>\n\nThe Burnet Flag was adopted by the Texan Congress on December 10, 1836.

This flag was simply the [[United States flag]] with a Lone star in the [[Canton (flag)|canton]]. This flag echoes an earlier design, carried by the forces of [[James Long (filibuster)|James Long]] in failed 1819 and 1821 attempts to separate Texas from Spanish control. This earlier flag was exactly the same, save for the canton having a red background rather than blue. There is evidence that the Lone Star and Stripes was used at the battles of Goliad, the Alamo, and San Jacinto, and the first Congress of the Republic of Texas as convened under it in 1836. Although interim President David Burnet issued a decree making the Lone Star and Stripes the first official flag of the Republic of Texas, it never became the legal national flag. It did remain the naval flag of Texas until annexation, and was noted for being \"beneficial to our [Texan] Navy and Merchantmen\" due to its resemblance to the U.S. flag. Despite its unofficial status, the flag remained well known inside the region and internationally as the symbol of Texas. The official blue and gold \"Burnett Flag,\" on the other hand, was little known by Texans, and no contemporary illustrations of it have been discovered except for on the first series 2 dollar note of the Texas Dollar. An 1837 chart of national flags printed in Philadelphia showed the Lone Star and Stripes as the national flag of Texas, and Texas Senator Oliver Jones, who led the 1839 committee which approved the Lone Star Flag, was unaware that the Lone Star and Stripes was not the current official flag.<ref>{{cite book | last=Maberry | first=Robert, Jr.| title=Texas Flags|publisher=Texas A&M University Press |year=2001|isbn=978-1-58544-151-8|location=College Station|pages=28\u201338}}</ref> Later, prior to the [[American Civil War]], this flag was carried by Floridian militiamen in Pensacola during the seizure of U.S. property in that city.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe \"Come and Take It Flag\" was created by the people of Gonzales, featuring the phrase, a black five pointed star, and the image of the town cannon Mexican forces had demanded they turn over. In March 1831, Juan Gomez, a lieutenant in the Mexican Army, granted a small cannon to the colony of San Antonio. It was then transported to Gonzales, Texas and later was the object of Texas pride. At the minor skirmish known as the [[Battle of Gonzales]], a small group of Texans successfully resisted the Mexican forces who had orders to seize their cannon. As a symbol of defiance, the Texans had fashioned a flag containing the phrase along with a black star and an image of the cannon which they had received six years earlier from Mexican officials.\n\nThe so-called \"Alamo Flag\" or \"1824 flag\" was created by replacing the Eagle in the center of the Mexican tricolor with the year \"1824,\" referencing the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]], in support of which Texas was fighting. This was the first flag approved for use by rebel forces by a Texan legislative body. In 1835, the Texan provisional government approved the use of this flag for privateers preying on Mexican commerce.  It has often been said that the 1824 flag was flown by Texan forces at the [[Battle of the Alamo]]. However, this was never alleged until 1860, long after the battle had occurred. Modern writers have pointed out that the presence of the 1824 flag at the time and place of the battle is highly unlikely. A similar flag was flown at least briefly by Texan Tejano forces, featuring two black, six pointed stars in place of the date. It is likely that the actual \"Alamo flag\" referred to by accounts of the time was the Lone Star and Stripes, which had been depicted in use at earlier battles such as Goliad, and was widely referred to as the \"[[Texian]] flag.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=Maberry | first=Robert, Jr.| title=Texas Flags |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |year=2001|isbn=978-1-58544-151-8|location=College Station|pages=11, 26, 28\u201332}}</ref>\n\nThe Dodson Tricolor or Dodson flag was designed and sewn by a Mrs. Sarah Dodson during the Revolution.

The U.S. Congress placed Chambersburg on the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh postal road in 1803.  The road was rebuilt as the Chambersburg-Bedford Turnpike in 1811.  The [[Cumberland Valley Railroad]] was built in 1837 and was the area's center of economic activity for nearly 100 years.  Until the completion of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s [[Main Line (Pennsylvania Railroad)|main line]] in 1857, the fastest route from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia was by stagecoach from Pittsburgh to Chambersburg, and then by train to Philadelphia.\n\n=== Civil War era ===\n[[Image:BurntCourtChambersburgPA1864.jpg|thumb|Franklin County Courthouse|300px|left|Franklin County Courthouse following the 1864 McCausland raid.]]\n\n==== Underground railroad / John Brown ====\n\n[[File:ChambersburgStatue.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Statue of a Union soldier on the main square.]]\nBy 1859, Chambersburg and its active community of free and enslaved blacks and sympathetic whites was a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]].

The actual burning divided two of his cavalry commanders, because when Maryland-born Gen. Joseph \"Allegheny\" Johnson saw the behavior of Gen. McCausland's troops in Chambersburg, he refused to participate in a similar burning at Cumberland and Hancock, Maryland not far to the south, so both those towns survived despite likewise not paying ransoms.<ref>Douglas Southall Freeman, Lee's Lieutenants (abridged 1-volume version edited by Stephen W. Sears) (Scribner 1998) p. 745</ref> Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. [[William W. Averill]], although initially misdirected toward Baltimore and thus late to arrive to prevent the atrocities, also pursued the Confederates, who sustained several defeats and lost most of the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by November. Furthermore, when the Army of Northern Virginia surrendered on April 9, 1865, Early escaped to Texas by horseback, where he hoped to find a Confederate force still holding out.  He proceeded to Mexico, and from there, sailed to [[Cuba]] and [[Canada]]. Living in [[Toronto]], he wrote his [[memoir]], ''A Memoir of the Last Year of the War for Independence, in the Confederate States of America'', which focused on his Valley Campaign and was published in 1867.\n\n==== Chambersburg's Reconstruction ====\n\nA combination of state and private funding rebuilt Chambersburg. However, many new buildings were erected quickly and not initially built to the original standards. It took more than 30 years to fully restore the town's housing stock to pre-Civil War standards. As discussed further below, Chambersburg was the site of one of the 69 schools established by Pennsylvania to educate children orphaned by the war, and which remained when all other such were closed decades later. Known as \"The Scotland School for Veterans Children\" after the 1890s, it remained open until 2010 and graduated more than 10,000 children during its lifetime.\n\n==== Memorialization of Civil War ====\n[[Image:Diamondviewfolder20a.gif|thumb|right|250px| \"Fountain, Memorial Square, Chambersburg, Pa.\" 1921 post card.]]\nSince people from Chambersburg had relatives on both sides during the war, and the war devastated the town, the town event also became a part of the town's identity. On July 17, 1878, 15,000 people attended dedication of Memorial Fountain in the town's center, which honors the Civil War soldiers, and later Chambersburg's fighters in other wars. A statue of a Union soldier stands next to the fountain, facing south to guard against the return of southern raiders.\n\nTo this day, the Civil War burning of Chambersburg remains a part of the town's historic identity and yearly memorial events are held, especially near July 30.\n\nChambersburg has also recently been the subject of study on how people have historically perceived and responded to war tragedies.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== National Register of Historic Places ===\nThe following places in Chambersburg are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/pa/Franklin/state.html|title =National Register of Historic Places|publisher=NationalRegisterofHistoricPlaces.com|  accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}</ref>\n[[Image:Diamondviewfolder8.gif|thumb|right|250px| \"Wilson's College for Girls Main Bldg.

The actual burning divided two of his cavalry commanders, because when Maryland-born Gen. Joseph \"Allegheny\" Johnson saw the behavior of Gen. McCausland's troops in Chambersburg, he refused to participate in a similar burning at Cumberland and Hancock, Maryland not far to the south, so both those towns survived despite likewise not paying ransoms.<ref>Douglas Southall Freeman, Lee's Lieutenants (abridged 1-volume version edited by Stephen W. Sears) (Scribner 1998) p. 745</ref> Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. [[William W. Averill]], although initially misdirected toward Baltimore and thus late to arrive to prevent the atrocities, also pursued the Confederates, who sustained several defeats and lost most of the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by November. Furthermore, when the Army of Northern Virginia surrendered on April 9, 1865, Early escaped to Texas by horseback, where he hoped to find a Confederate force still holding out.  He proceeded to Mexico, and from there, sailed to [[Cuba]] and [[Canada]]. Living in [[Toronto]], he wrote his [[memoir]], ''A Memoir of the Last Year of the War for Independence, in the Confederate States of America'', which focused on his Valley Campaign and was published in 1867.\n\n==== Chambersburg's Reconstruction ====\n\nA combination of state and private funding rebuilt Chambersburg. However, many new buildings were erected quickly and not initially built to the original standards. It took more than 30 years to fully restore the town's housing stock to pre-Civil War standards. As discussed further below, Chambersburg was the site of one of the 69 schools established by Pennsylvania to educate children orphaned by the war, and which remained when all other such were closed decades later. Known as \"The Scotland School for Veterans Children\" after the 1890s, it remained open until 2010 and graduated more than 10,000 children during its lifetime.\n\n==== Memorialization of Civil War ====\n[[Image:Diamondviewfolder20a.gif|thumb|right|250px| \"Fountain, Memorial Square, Chambersburg, Pa.\" 1921 post card.]]\nSince people from Chambersburg had relatives on both sides during the war, and the war devastated the town, the town event also became a part of the town's identity. On July 17, 1878, 15,000 people attended dedication of Memorial Fountain in the town's center, which honors the Civil War soldiers, and later Chambersburg's fighters in other wars. A statue of a Union soldier stands next to the fountain, facing south to guard against the return of southern raiders.\n\nTo this day, the Civil War burning of Chambersburg remains a part of the town's historic identity and yearly memorial events are held, especially near July 30.\n\nChambersburg has also recently been the subject of study on how people have historically perceived and responded to war tragedies.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== National Register of Historic Places ===\nThe following places in Chambersburg are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/pa/Franklin/state.html|title =National Register of Historic Places|publisher=NationalRegisterofHistoricPlaces.com|  accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}</ref>\n[[Image:Diamondviewfolder8.gif|thumb|right|250px| \"Wilson's College for Girls Main Bldg.

Governor Curtin and his wife realized the orphaned children of Pennsylvania's many soldiers had been forgotten. He established 70 'Soldier's Orphan Schools' across the state. Over time, the number of eligible students declined, and in 1895 all of the schools closed except that located in the unincorporated village of [[Scotland, Pennsylvania|Scotland]] about four miles (6&nbsp;km) north of Chambersburg. The name was changed to Scotland School for Veteran's Children, then the Pennsylvania Soldiers Orphans Industrial School, and eligibility criteria changed to provide an education to any child of any veteran, whether that veteran was living or deceased (so the school's founding date is sometimes 1895). It had about 300 students in grades 3\u201312, annually. More than 10,000 students were educated at the school before it closed in 2009, when Pennsylvania's legislators concurred in the decision of Governor [[Ed Rendell]] to remove funding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foundationssvc.org/ |title=Foundation For Scotland School For Veterans' Children |accessdate=2010-11-22 |last=Frame |first=C.
