Since 1965, Acton equates to the east of the [[London Borough of Ealing]], though some of East Acton is in the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]] and a small portion of South Acton is in the [[London Borough of Hounslow]]. Acton and Harrow are the two locations with the most stations bearing their name anywhere in the United Kingdom (apart from the full names of the London terminus stations), with seven each.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nCentral Acton is synonymous with the hub of commerce and retail on the former main road between London and [[Oxford]] ([[Uxbridge Road|the Uxbridge Road]]); a reminder of its history is in its inns, which date back in cases to the late [[Tudor period]] as stopping places for travellers. Nowadays, the principal route linking London and [[Oxford]] (the [[A40 road|A40]] dual carriageway) bypasses central Acton, but passes through East Acton and North Acton.\n\n==Toponymy==\nActon's name derives from the Old English words ''\u0101c'' (oak) and ''t\u016bn'' (enclosed garden, enclosure), meaning \"a garden or a field enclosed by oaks\". Later, in the Middle Ages ''t\u016bn'' became a synonym for \"farm\" or \"farm by oak trees\". For several centuries, its name bore the prefix ''Church'' (hence ''Chirche Acton'', ''Churche Acton'', etc.) to distinguish it from the separate hamlet of East Acton.<ref name=\"Mills1\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Stmarysacton2.jpg|thumb|[[St Mary]]'s Church, King Street, Acton Central]]\nPrehistoric settlement is shown by finds of [[Palaeolithic]], [[Neolithic]], and [[Bronze Age]] burials at Mill Hill Park, and [[Iron Age]] coins near Bollo Lane. In the Middle Ages the northern half of the parish was heavily wooded. Oaks and elms still stood along roads and hedgerows and in private grounds in the early 20th century, but most of the woodland had been cleared by the 17th century, even on the extensive Old Oak common.<ref name=growth>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22546|title=Acton: Growth|authors =T F T Baker, C R Elrington (editors), Diane K Bolton, Patricia E C Croot, M A Hicks|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|date=1982|work=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 7: Acton, Chiswick, Ealing and Brentford, West Twyford, Willesden|accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Medieval era===\nLandholders figuring in county records were resident by 1222 and houses were recorded from the late 13th century. The main settlement, Church Acton or Acton town, lay slightly west of the centre of the parish along the highway to Oxford (Uxbridge Road) at the 5-mile post out of London. By 1380 some of the tenements, such as ''The Tabard'' and ''The Cock'', along the south side of the road, were inns. The hamlet of East Acton, mentioned in 1294, consisted of farmhouses and cottages north and south of common land known as East Acton green by 1474.<ref name=growth/>\n\nMedieval settlement was mainly around the two hamlets. At Church Acton most of the farmhouses lay along the Oxford road or Horn Lane, with only a few outlying farms. Friars Place Farm at the north end of Horn Lane and the moated site to the west, occupied until the 15th century, were early farms. East of Friars Place farm were commons: Worton or Watton Green and Rush green in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Friars Place in the 18th century, where there was some settlement by 1664. To the north-west were Acton or Old Oak wells, known by 1613. In the parish's extreme south, a few farmhouses on the northern side of Acton common or Acton Green were mentioned as in Turnham Green until the 19th century and were linked more closely with that village than with Acton. ''Gregories'', mentioned in 1551 as a copyhold tenement with 30 a. near Bollo Lane and the Brentford high road, probably lay in Acton.<ref name=growth/>\n\nLondoners were increasingly involved in land sales from the early 14th century but apparently did not live in Acton until the late 15th. The [[manor]], part of Fulham, had no [[demesne|resident (demesne) lord]], and apart from a brief period before c. 1735, when a branch of the landed [[Duke of Beaufort|Somerset (Duke of Beaufort's) family]] lived in Acton, there were no large resident landowners. Many of the tenements without land, including most of the inns, frequently changed hands.<ref name=growth/>\n\n===Early modern period===\nBy the 17th century Acton's proximity to London had made it a summer retreat for courtiers and lawyers. Sir [[Isle of Wight (UK Parliament constituency)|Richard Sutton]] bought the seat at East Acton known later as Manor House in 1610 and Sir [[Henry Garraway]] probably rebuilt Acton House in 1638. Sir [[John Trevor (1596\u20131673)|John Trevor]] MP bought several Acton properties in the mid 17th century, including Berrymead/Berrymede, improving it with a lake and stream, home of [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax]] and his second son after him, and afterwards of the [[Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull]], with a much-praised landscape.<ref name=growth/>\n\nThe parish had 158 [[Holy Communion|communicants]] in 1548. In 1664 it had 72 chargeable households and 59 exempt, with 6 empty houses. Six houses had 10 or more hearths, 16 had from 5 to 9, 33 had 3 or 4, 23 had 2, and 53 had 1. Action had about 160 families resident in the mid 18th century.<ref name=growth/>\n\nActon was lauded as \"blessed with very sweet air\" in 1706 by rector urging a friend in verse to move there. The fashion for medicinal waters brought a brief period of fame, with the exploitation of the wells at Old Oak common, when East Acton and Friars Place were said to be thronged with summer visitors, who had brought about improvement in the houses there. Although high society had left Acton by the mid 18th century, many professional and military men bought houses there, sometimes including a small park, until well into the 19th century. The break-up of the {{convert|800|acres|km2}} Fetherstonhaugh estate, which had had no resident owner, produced four or five small estates whose owners, professional men such as Samuel Wegg, John Winter, and Richard White, were active in parish affairs. Grand early homes included: Heathfield Lodge, West Lodge, and East Lodge by Winter c. 1800, Mill Hill House by White, and Woodlands at Acton Hill soon afterwards. Acton Green also became increasingly popular, being near Chiswick High Road (the Great West Road). Fairlawn, substantial, on west side of the green, was the home of the botanist [[John Lindley]] (1797\u20131865) as was the house to the north and Bedford House, another home of Lindley, and Melbourne House further east. A short row of houses had been built on the south side of the green by 1800.<ref name=growth/>\n\n===19th Century development===\n[[File:Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths' Alms Houses, Acton.jpg|thumb|Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths' Alms Houses, Acton, 1812.]]\nIn 1812, twenty [[almshouses]] were built by the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]] on the former Perryn estate, on land which had been left to the Company by [[John Perryn]] in 1657.<ref>[https://www.thegoldsmiths.co.uk/company/history/history-of-the-company/ Official history] Retrieved 18 June 2018</ref>\n\nThere were 241 inhabited houses in 1801 and 426 by 1831. Growth took place mainly in the established residential neighbourhoods of Acton town and East Acton, but Acton Green also had acquired a cluster of cottages and houses at the bottom of Acton Lane by 1842. Acton was mostly rural in 1831. The few mansions contrasted sharply with most of the houses, which were described as 'beneath mediocrity of character'. Despite an overall rise in the number of houses, poor rates had to be increased in the 1820s because of a growing number of empty dwellings.<ref name=growth/>\n\nMore widespread building [[urban planning|was planned]] and took place in the 1850s. As a result of its soft water sources, Acton became famous for its laundries and at the end of the 19th century there were around 170 establishments in South Acton. These laundries would serve hotels and the rich in London's West End, leading to the nickname \"Soapsuds Island\" or \"Soap Sud City\". At least 600 different laundries operated within South Acton; the last laundry closed in the late 1970s and is now a low redbrick block of flats.<ref>[http://www.actonhistory.co.uk/acton/page10.html Laundry details and number of sites], actonhistory.co.uk; accessed 14 January 2016.</ref>\n\nThe parish of Acton formed a [[local board of health]] in 1865 and became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] in 1894.\n\n===20th century===\nThe town was incorporated as the [[Municipal Borough of Acton]] in 1921. This authority combined with the [[municipal boroughs]] of [[Municipal Borough of Ealing|Ealing]] and [[Municipal Borough of Southall|Southall]] to form the London Borough of Ealing, within [[Greater London]], in 1965.<ref name=growth/> An Acton Golf Club was founded in 1896, which closed in 1920 and the area was redeveloped for housing.<ref>[http://www.golfsmissinglinks.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=750 \"Acton Golf Club, London\"], \"Golf\u2019s Missing Links\".</ref>\n\n[[Municipal Borough of Acton|Acton]] formed an urban district and, later, municipal borough of [[Middlesex]] from 1894 to 1965. Its former area was used to form part of the London Borough of Ealing in 1965. During the 20th century Acton was a major industrial centre employing tens of thousands of people, particularly in the motor vehicles and components industries. The industries of North Acton merged with the great industrial concentrations of [[Park Royal]] and [[Harlesden]]. One of the most important firms was [[Renault]] of France, which made cars, including the [[Renault 4CV|4CV]] and the [[Renault Dauphine]], at a factory in North Acton from 1926 until 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://londonist.com/2015/11/london-made-motors|title=London's Lost Manufacturing - We Were Once The British Detroit|publisher=Londonist|accessdate=16 January 2016}}</ref> Renault has remained on the site continuously since the 1920s and still has its main London showroom on the Park Royal site.\n\nFurther south [[Acton Vale, London|Acton Vale]] had famous names including [[D.

Bronnley & Co (Soaps), Evershed & Vignoles (electrical equipment), [[Lucas Industries plc#CAV|Lucas CAV]] (automotive electrical), [[Tony Vandervell|Vandervell Products]] (bearings), and [[Wilkinson Sword]] (swords and razors).\n\n==Acton Today==\nActon is now principally residential, though it maintains some light industry, particularly in the northeast Park Royal area, and the south near the border with Chiswick. [[Waitrose]] started in Acton, as Waite, Rose and Taylor - on the High Street near the police station - with its second branch opening in [[Churchfield Road]] in 1913.<ref>Waitrose: seeking to attain perfection by Janet Appleyard-Hobbs 2009 Acton History Society</ref>\n[[File:South acton harlech corfe beumaris.JPG|thumb|The South Acton estate]]\nActon is home to the largest housing estate in West London, the South Acton estate, with approximately 2,000 homes and 5,800 residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarag.org|title=South Acton Residents Action Group|publisher=Sarag.org|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis area is currently in the Phase 2 of a major 15-year phased regeneration which includes near-total demolition of the existing residential units, and the construction of new and more numerous residential units. Since [[World War II]], Acton has had a small but notable population of [[Poland|Polish]] immigrants. In recent years, a number of Antipodean immigrants have settled there; there are several [[Australia]]n and [[South Africa]]n pubs concentrated in a small area.

Since 1965, Acton equates to the east of the [[London Borough of Ealing]], though some of East Acton is in the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]] and a small portion of South Acton is in the [[London Borough of Hounslow]]. Acton and Harrow are the two locations with the most stations bearing their name anywhere in the United Kingdom (apart from the full names of the London terminus stations), with seven each.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nCentral Acton is synonymous with the hub of commerce and retail on the former main road between London and [[Oxford]] ([[Uxbridge Road|the Uxbridge Road]]); a reminder of its history is in its inns, which date back in cases to the late [[Tudor period]] as stopping places for travellers. Nowadays, the principal route linking London and [[Oxford]] (the [[A40 road|A40]] dual carriageway) bypasses central Acton, but passes through East Acton and North Acton.\n\n==Toponymy==\nActon's name derives from the Old English words ''\u0101c'' (oak) and ''t\u016bn'' (enclosed garden, enclosure), meaning \"a garden or a field enclosed by oaks\". Later, in the Middle Ages ''t\u016bn'' became a synonym for \"farm\" or \"farm by oak trees\". For several centuries, its name bore the prefix ''Church'' (hence ''Chirche Acton'', ''Churche Acton'', etc.) to distinguish it from the separate hamlet of East Acton.<ref name=\"Mills1\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Stmarysacton2.jpg|thumb|[[St Mary]]'s Church, King Street, Acton Central]]\nPrehistoric settlement is shown by finds of [[Palaeolithic]], [[Neolithic]], and [[Bronze Age]] burials at Mill Hill Park, and [[Iron Age]] coins near Bollo Lane. In the Middle Ages the northern half of the parish was heavily wooded. Oaks and elms still stood along roads and hedgerows and in private grounds in the early 20th century, but most of the woodland had been cleared by the 17th century, even on the extensive Old Oak common.<ref name=growth>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22546|title=Acton: Growth|authors =T F T Baker, C R Elrington (editors), Diane K Bolton, Patricia E C Croot, M A Hicks|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|date=1982|work=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 7: Acton, Chiswick, Ealing and Brentford, West Twyford, Willesden|accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Medieval era===\nLandholders figuring in county records were resident by 1222 and houses were recorded from the late 13th century. The main settlement, Church Acton or Acton town, lay slightly west of the centre of the parish along the highway to Oxford (Uxbridge Road) at the 5-mile post out of London. By 1380 some of the tenements, such as ''The Tabard'' and ''The Cock'', along the south side of the road, were inns. The hamlet of East Acton, mentioned in 1294, consisted of farmhouses and cottages north and south of common land known as East Acton green by 1474.<ref name=growth/>\n\nMedieval settlement was mainly around the two hamlets. At Church Acton most of the farmhouses lay along the Oxford road or Horn Lane, with only a few outlying farms. Friars Place Farm at the north end of Horn Lane and the moated site to the west, occupied until the 15th century, were early farms. East of Friars Place farm were commons: Worton or Watton Green and Rush green in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Friars Place in the 18th century, where there was some settlement by 1664. To the north-west were Acton or Old Oak wells, known by 1613. In the parish's extreme south, a few farmhouses on the northern side of Acton common or Acton Green were mentioned as in Turnham Green until the 19th century and were linked more closely with that village than with Acton. ''Gregories'', mentioned in 1551 as a copyhold tenement with 30 a. near Bollo Lane and the Brentford high road, probably lay in Acton.<ref name=growth/>\n\nLondoners were increasingly involved in land sales from the early 14th century but apparently did not live in Acton until the late 15th. The [[manor]], part of Fulham, had no [[demesne|resident (demesne) lord]], and apart from a brief period before c. 1735, when a branch of the landed [[Duke of Beaufort|Somerset (Duke of Beaufort's) family]] lived in Acton, there were no large resident landowners. Many of the tenements without land, including most of the inns, frequently changed hands.<ref name=growth/>\n\n===Early modern period===\nBy the 17th century Acton's proximity to London had made it a summer retreat for courtiers and lawyers. Sir [[Isle of Wight (UK Parliament constituency)|Richard Sutton]] bought the seat at East Acton known later as Manor House in 1610 and Sir [[Henry Garraway]] probably rebuilt Acton House in 1638. Sir [[John Trevor (1596\u20131673)|John Trevor]] MP bought several Acton properties in the mid 17th century, including Berrymead/Berrymede, improving it with a lake and stream, home of [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax]] and his second son after him, and afterwards of the [[Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull]], with a much-praised landscape.<ref name=growth/>\n\nThe parish had 158 [[Holy Communion|communicants]] in 1548. In 1664 it had 72 chargeable households and 59 exempt, with 6 empty houses. Six houses had 10 or more hearths, 16 had from 5 to 9, 33 had 3 or 4, 23 had 2, and 53 had 1. Action had about 160 families resident in the mid 18th century.<ref name=growth/>\n\nActon was lauded as \"blessed with very sweet air\" in 1706 by rector urging a friend in verse to move there. The fashion for medicinal waters brought a brief period of fame, with the exploitation of the wells at Old Oak common, when East Acton and Friars Place were said to be thronged with summer visitors, who had brought about improvement in the houses there. Although high society had left Acton by the mid 18th century, many professional and military men bought houses there, sometimes including a small park, until well into the 19th century. The break-up of the {{convert|800|acres|km2}} Fetherstonhaugh estate, which had had no resident owner, produced four or five small estates whose owners, professional men such as Samuel Wegg, John Winter, and Richard White, were active in parish affairs. Grand early homes included: Heathfield Lodge, West Lodge, and East Lodge by Winter c. 1800, Mill Hill House by White, and Woodlands at Acton Hill soon afterwards. Acton Green also became increasingly popular, being near Chiswick High Road (the Great West Road). Fairlawn, substantial, on west side of the green, was the home of the botanist [[John Lindley]] (1797\u20131865) as was the house to the north and Bedford House, another home of Lindley, and Melbourne House further east. A short row of houses had been built on the south side of the green by 1800.<ref name=growth/>\n\n===19th Century development===\n[[File:Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths' Alms Houses, Acton.jpg|thumb|Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths' Alms Houses, Acton, 1812.]]\nIn 1812, twenty [[almshouses]] were built by the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]] on the former Perryn estate, on land which had been left to the Company by [[John Perryn]] in 1657.<ref>[https://www.thegoldsmiths.co.uk/company/history/history-of-the-company/ Official history] Retrieved 18 June 2018</ref>\n\nThere were 241 inhabited houses in 1801 and 426 by 1831. Growth took place mainly in the established residential neighbourhoods of Acton town and East Acton, but Acton Green also had acquired a cluster of cottages and houses at the bottom of Acton Lane by 1842. Acton was mostly rural in 1831. The few mansions contrasted sharply with most of the houses, which were described as 'beneath mediocrity of character'. Despite an overall rise in the number of houses, poor rates had to be increased in the 1820s because of a growing number of empty dwellings.<ref name=growth/>\n\nMore widespread building [[urban planning|was planned]] and took place in the 1850s. As a result of its soft water sources, Acton became famous for its laundries and at the end of the 19th century there were around 170 establishments in South Acton. These laundries would serve hotels and the rich in London's West End, leading to the nickname \"Soapsuds Island\" or \"Soap Sud City\". At least 600 different laundries operated within South Acton; the last laundry closed in the late 1970s and is now a low redbrick block of flats.<ref>[http://www.actonhistory.co.uk/acton/page10.html Laundry details and number of sites], actonhistory.co.uk; accessed 14 January 2016.</ref>\n\nThe parish of Acton formed a [[local board of health]] in 1865 and became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] in 1894. \n\n===20th century===\nThe town was incorporated as the [[Municipal Borough of Acton]] in 1921. This authority combined with the [[municipal boroughs]] of [[Municipal Borough of Ealing|Ealing]] and [[Municipal Borough of Southall|Southall]] to form the London Borough of Ealing, within [[Greater London]], in 1965.<ref name=growth/> An Acton Golf Club was founded in 1896, which closed in 1920 and the area was redeveloped for housing.<ref>[http://www.golfsmissinglinks.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=750 \"Acton Golf Club, London\"], \"Golf\u2019s Missing Links\".</ref>\n\n[[Municipal Borough of Acton|Acton]] formed an urban district and, later, municipal borough of [[Middlesex]] from 1894 to 1965. Its former area was used to form part of the London Borough of Ealing in 1965. During the 20th century Acton was a major industrial centre employing tens of thousands of people, particularly in the motor vehicles and components industries. The industries of North Acton merged with the great industrial concentrations of [[Park Royal]] and [[Harlesden]]. One of the most important firms was [[Renault]] of France, which made cars, including the [[Renault 4CV|4CV]] and the [[Renault Dauphine]], at a factory in North Acton from 1926 until 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://londonist.com/2015/11/london-made-motors|title=London's Lost Manufacturing - We Were Once The British Detroit|publisher=Londonist|accessdate=16 January 2016}}</ref> Renault has remained on the site continuously since the 1920s and still has its main London showroom on the Park Royal site.\n\nFurther south [[Acton Vale, London|Acton Vale]] had famous names including [[D.

A '''tenured''' post is an indefinite academic appointment that can be terminated only for [[Causation (law)|cause]] or under extraordinary circumstances, such as financial exigency or program discontinuation. Tenure is a means of defending the principle of [[academic freedom]], which holds that it is beneficial for society in the long run if scholars are free to hold and examine a variety of views.\n\n== By country ==\n=== United States and Canada ===\n{{See also|Academic tenure in North America}}\n\nUnder the tenure systems adopted by many [[university|universities]] and [[college]]s in the United States and Canada, some faculty positions have tenure and some do not. Typical systems (such as the widely adopted \"1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure\" of the [[American Association of University Professors]]<ref>http://aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure; this statement has been adopted by more than 200 scholarly and academic groups (http://aaup.org/endorsers-1940-statement). The American Association of University Professors also publishes [http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/policydocs/contents/RIR.htm \"Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure\"].</ref>) allow only a limited period to establish a record of published research, ability to attract grant funding, [[academic visibility]], teaching excellence, and administrative or community service. They limit the number of years that any employee can remain employed as a non-tenured instructor or professor, compelling the institution to grant tenure to or terminate an individual, with significant advance notice, at the end of a specified time period. Some institutions require promotion to Associate Professor as a condition of tenure. An institution may also offer other academic positions that are not time-limited, with titles such as Lecturer, Adjunct Professor, or Research Professor, but these positions do not carry the possibility of tenure and are said to not be \"tenure track.\" Typically, they have higher teaching loads, lower compensation, little influence within the institution, few if any benefits, and little protection of academic freedom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/report/status-non-tenure-track-faculty|title=The Status of Non-Tenure-Track Faculty {{!}} AAUP|website=www.aaup.org|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\n\nThe modern conception of tenure in US higher education originated with the [[American Association of University Professors]]' (AAUP) 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure|title=1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure \u2013 AAUP|website=Aaup.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref> Jointly formulated and endorsed by the AAUP and the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] (AAC&U), the 1940 Statement is endorsed by over 250 scholarly and higher education organizations and is widely adopted into faculty handbooks and collective bargaining agreements at institutions of higher education throughout the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure|title=What is academic tenure?|website=Aaup.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref> This statement holds that, \"The common good depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition\" and stresses that academic freedom is essential in teaching and research in this regard.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{See also|Academic ranks in the United Kingdom|Lecturer}}\nThe original form of academic tenure was removed in the United Kingdom in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/40/contents|title=Education Reform Act 1988|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=4 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-europe-does-academic-tenure-43362|title=Explainer: how Europe does academic tenure|last=Enders|first=J\u00fcrgen|work=The Conversation|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en}}</ref> In its place there is the distinction between permanent and temporary contracts for academics. A permanent lecturer in UK universities usually holds an open-ended position that covers teaching, research, and administrative responsibilities.\n\nResearch lecturers (where they are permanent appointments) are the equivalent in rank of lecturers and senior lecturers, but reflect a research-intensive orientation. Research lecturers are common in fields such as medicine, engineering, and biological and physical sciences.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/UnitedKingdom|title=United Kingdom, Academic Career Structure|work=European University Institute|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{See also|Habilitation#Germany|Academic ranks in Germany}}\nAcademics are divided into two classes: On the one hand, professors (W2/W3&C3/C4 positions in the new&old systems of pay grades) are employed as state civil servants and hold tenure as highly safeguarded lifetime employment; On the other hand, there is a much larger group of \"junior staff\" on fixed-term contracts, research grants, fellowships and part-time jobs. In 2010, 9% of academic staff were professors, 66% were \"junior staff\" (including doctoral candidates on contracts), and 25% were other academic staff in secondary employment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buwin.de/dateien/2013/buwin2013keyresults.pdf/view|title=buwin2013keyresults.pdf \u2014 BuWiN 2017|website=www.buwin.de|language=de|access-date=6 February 2018}}</ref> Permanent research, teaching and management positions below professorship as an \"Akademischer Rat\" (a civil service position salaried like high school teachers) have become relatively rare compared to the 1970s and 1980s and are often no longer refilled after a retirement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/akademische-karrieren-manche-verteidigen-das-system-als-charakterbildend-/5942506-3.html|title=Prek\u00e4re Arbeitsverh\u00e4ltnisse an Universit\u00e4ten nehmen zu\n|language=de|access-date=8 March 2018}}</ref> In order to attain the position of Professor, in some fields, an academic must usually complete a \"[[Habilitation]]\" (a kind of broader second PhD thesis), after which she or he is eligible for tenureship. This means that, compared to other countries, academics in Germany obtain tenure at a relatively late age, as on average one becomes an Academic Assistant at the age of 42.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206154130/https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-europe-does-academic-tenure-43362|title=Explainer: how Europe does academic tenure|date=6 February 2018|access-date=6 February 2018}}</ref> In 2002 the \"Juniorprofessur\" position (comparable to an assistant professor in the US, but not always endowed with a tenure track) was introduced as an alternative to \"Habilitation\". However, the degree of formal equivalence between a \"Habilitation\" and a successfully completed \"Juniorprofessur\" varies across the different states (''Bundesl\u00e4nder''), and the informal recognition of having served as a \"Juniorprofessur\" as a replacement for the \"Habilitation\" in the appointment procedures for professorships varies greatly between disciplines.\n\nDue to a university system that guarantees universities relative academic freedom, the position of professor in Germany is relatively strong and independent. As civil servants, professors have a series of attendant rights and benefits, yet this status is subject to discussion. In the W pay scale the professorial pay is related to performance rather than merely to age, as it was in C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besoldungsordnung_W|title=W Besoldung (pay scale)|access-date=18 July 2019}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}}\n\n=== Denmark ===\nTenure does not exist in Denmark, although Danish universities in advertisements for faculty positions usually state that professor positions are tenured. The lack of formal tenure had no significant implications until Denmark abandoned democracy at the universities in the early 2000s. Since the opening of University ofCopenhagen in 1479<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Copenhagen|title=University of Copenhagen}}</ref> rectors, deans and heads of department were elected by the employees and decisions on hiring and dismissal were taken in institute/faculty boards. Since the change, all managers are employed as managers without academic responsibilities, and they all refer to the manager directly above themselves without obligation to hear the opinions of their employees, also in cases of hiring and dismissal.\n\nThis new system was introduced by parliament on proposal by the Minister of Science, Technology and Development, Helge Sander based on his vision that Danish universities in the future should compete about funding in analogy to football clubs. Mr. Sander\u2019s professional background, before entering politics, was as sports journalist and director of a football club<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helge_Sander|title=Helge Sander}}</ref>.\n\nThe lack of tenure in Denmark was most clearly demonstrated by University of Copenhagen in 2016, when the university illegally sacked the internationally renowned professor, Hans Thybo, after 37 years of employment in academic positions<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/news/sacking-of-prominent-geoscientist-rocks-community-1.21095|title=Nature: Sacking of prominent geoscientist rocks community}}</ref>.  A later court decision ruled the dismissal illegal after a court hearing demonstrated that the university\u2019s reasons for the dismissal were false accusations by managers, but the university did not reinstall Thybo in his position<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uniavisen.dk/en/sacking-of-top-geologist-hans-thybo-was-unjustified|title=Sacking of top geologist Hans Thybo was unjustified}}</ref>. The reasons for the dismissal were that Thybo had been using his gmail for work purposes and that he allegedly should have put unacceptable pressure on a postdoc for making him criticize management. The accusation for pressure was based on statements from management, including two  of Thybo\u2019s former colleagues, who for long had expressed deep envy about his scientific successes, as well as a former colleague to one of them, who recently had become head of department, and who had never met Thybo beforehand. The university maintained the dismissal after having received written statement from the postdoc that the accusation was false, and that Thybo never put pressure on him to do anything. University of Copenhagen has carried out other similar dismissal after Thybo case.\n\nThe implications are that any professor in Denmark can be dismissed based on personal grudge and envy by any new management  taking office, and that tenure does not exist in Denmark.\n\n== Arguments in favor ==\nMany argue, among other things, that the job security granted by tenure is necessary to recruit talented individuals into professorships, because in many fields private industry jobs pay significantly more.  Tenure also protects teachers from being fired for personal, political, or other non-work related reasons.

They limit the number of years that any employee can remain employed as a non-tenured instructor or professor, compelling the institution to grant tenure to or terminate an individual, with significant advance notice, at the end of a specified time period. Some institutions require promotion to Associate Professor as a condition of tenure. An institution may also offer other academic positions that are not time-limited, with titles such as Lecturer, Adjunct Professor, or Research Professor, but these positions do not carry the possibility of tenure and are said to not be \"tenure track.\" Typically, they have higher teaching loads, lower compensation, little influence within the institution, few if any benefits, and little protection of academic freedom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/report/status-non-tenure-track-faculty|title=The Status of Non-Tenure-Track Faculty {{!}} AAUP|website=www.aaup.org|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\n\nThe modern conception of tenure in US higher education originated with the [[American Association of University Professors]]' (AAUP) 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure|title=1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure \u2013 AAUP|website=Aaup.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref> Jointly formulated and endorsed by the AAUP and the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] (AAC&U), the 1940 Statement is endorsed by over 250 scholarly and higher education organizations and is widely adopted into faculty handbooks and collective bargaining agreements at institutions of higher education throughout the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure|title=What is academic tenure?|website=Aaup.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref> This statement holds that, \"The common good depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition\" and stresses that academic freedom is essential in teaching and research in this regard.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{See also|Academic ranks in the United Kingdom|Lecturer}}\nThe original form of academic tenure was removed in the United Kingdom in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/40/contents|title=Education Reform Act 1988|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=4 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-europe-does-academic-tenure-43362|title=Explainer: how Europe does academic tenure|last=Enders|first=J\u00fcrgen|work=The Conversation|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en}}</ref> In its place there is the distinction between permanent and temporary contracts for academics.

This means that, compared to other countries, academics in Germany obtain tenure at a relatively late age, as on average one becomes an Academic Assistant at the age of 42.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206154130/https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-europe-does-academic-tenure-43362|title=Explainer: how Europe does academic tenure|date=6 February 2018|access-date=6 February 2018}}</ref> In 2002 the \"Juniorprofessur\" position (comparable to an assistant professor in the US, but not always endowed with a tenure track) was introduced as an alternative to \"Habilitation\". However, the degree of formal equivalence between a \"Habilitation\" and a successfully completed \"Juniorprofessur\" varies across the different states (''Bundesl\u00e4nder''), and the informal recognition of having served as a \"Juniorprofessur\" as a replacement for the \"Habilitation\" in the appointment procedures for professorships varies greatly between disciplines.\n\nDue to a university system that guarantees universities relative academic freedom, the position of professor in Germany is relatively strong and independent. As civil servants, professors have a series of attendant rights and benefits, yet this status is subject to discussion. In the W pay scale the professorial pay is related to performance rather than merely to age, as it was in C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besoldungsordnung_W|title=W Besoldung (pay scale)|access-date=18 July 2019}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}}\n\n=== Denmark ===\nTenure does not exist in Denmark, although Danish universities in advertisements for faculty positions usually state that professor positions are tenured. The lack of formal tenure had no significant implications until Denmark abandoned democracy at the universities in the early 2000\u2019s. Since the opening of University ofCopenhagen in 1479<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Copenhagen|title=University of Copenhagen}}</ref> rectors, deans and heads of department were elected by the employees and decisions on hiring and dismissal were taken in institute/faculty boards. Since the change, all managers are employed as managers without academic responsibilities, and they all refer to the manager directly above themselves without obligation to hear the opinions of their employees, also in cases of hiring and dismissal.\n\nThis new system was introduced by parliament on proposal by the Minister of Science, Technology and Development, Helge Sander based on his vision that Danish universities in the future should compete about funding in analogy to football clubs. Mr. Sander\u2019s professional background, before entering politics, was as sports journalist and director of a football club<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helge_Sander|title=Helge Sander}}</ref>.\n\nThe lack of tenure in Denmark was most clearly demonstrated by University of Copenhagen in 2016, when the university illegally sacked the internationally renowned professor, Hans Thybo, after 37 years of employment in academic positions<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/news/sacking-of-prominent-geoscientist-rocks-community-1.21095|title=Nature: Sacking of prominent geoscientist rocks community}}</ref>.  A later court decision ruled the dismissal illegal after a court hearing demonstrated that the university\u2019s reasons for the dismissal were false accusations by managers, but the university did not reinstall Thybo in his position<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uniavisen.dk/en/sacking-of-top-geologist-hans-thybo-was-unjustified|title=Sacking of top geologist Hans Thybo was unjustified}}</ref>. The reasons for the dismissal were that Thybo had been using his gmail for work purposes and that he allegedly should have put unacceptable pressure on a postdoc for making him criticize management. The accusation for pressure was based on statements from management, including two  of Thybo\u2019s former colleagues, who for long had expressed deep envy about his scientific successes, as well as a former colleague to one of them, who recently had become head of department, and who had never met Thybo beforehand. The university maintained the dismissal after having received written statement from the postdoc that the accusation was false, and that Thybo never put pressure on him to do anything. University of Copenhagen has carried out other similar dismissal after Thybo case.\n\nThe implications are that any professor in Denmark can be dismissed based on personal grudge and envy by any new management  taking office, and that tenure does not exist in Denmark.\n\n== Arguments in favor ==\nMany argue, among other things, that the job security granted by tenure is necessary to recruit talented individuals into professorships, because in many fields private industry jobs pay significantly more.  Tenure also protects teachers from being fired for personal, political, or other non-work related reasons. Tenure prohibits school districts from firing experienced teachers to hire less experienced, less expensive teachers as well as protects teachers from being fired for teaching unpopular, controversial, or otherwise challenged curricula such as evolutionary, theological, biology and controversial literature.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n== Arguments against ==\nSome have argued that modern tenure systems diminish academic freedom, forcing those seeking tenured positions to profess conformance to the level of mediocrity as those awarding the tenured professorships.

Printmaking normally covers only the process of creating prints that have an element of originality, rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painting.  Except in the case of [[monotyping]], the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print.  Each print produced is considered an \"original\" work of art, and is correctly referred to as an \"impression\", not a \"copy\" (that means a different print copying the first, common in early printmaking).  Often impressions vary considerably, whether intentionally or not.  The images on most prints are created for that purpose, perhaps with a preparatory study such as a drawing.  A print that copies another work of art, especially a painting, is known as a \"reproductive print\".\n\nPrints are created by transferring ink from a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] to a sheet of paper or other material, by a variety of techniques. Common types of matrices include: metal plates, usually copper or zinc, or polymer plates and other thicker plastic sheets for [[engraving]] or [[etching]]; stone, aluminum, or polymer for [[lithography]]; blocks of wood for [[woodcut]]s and [[wood engraving]]s; and linoleum for [[linocut]]s. Screens made of silk or synthetic fabrics are used for the [[screen printing]] process. Other types of matrix substrates and related processes are discussed below.\n\nMultiple impressions printed from the same matrix form an [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]. Since the late 19th century, artists have generally signed individual impressions from an edition and often number the impressions to form a limited edition; the matrix is then destroyed so that no more prints can be produced. Prints may also be printed in book form, such as illustrated books or [[artist's book]]s.\n\n== Techniques ==\n{{external media | width = 300px | align = right | video1 = [https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history-basics/artists-materials-techniques/printmaking/v/moma-relief-printmaking Printmaking: Woodcuts and Engravings], [[Smarthistory]]}}\n\n=== Overview===\nPrintmaking techniques are generally divided into the following basic categories:\n* [[relief print|Relief]], where ink is applied to the original surface of the matrix. Relief techniques include [[woodcut]] or [[woodblock printing|woodblock]] as the Asian forms are usually known, [[wood engraving]], [[linocut]] and [[metalcut]].\n* [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]], where ink is applied beneath the original surface of the matrix. Intaglio techniques include [[engraving]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[aquatint]].\n* [[Planographic]], where the matrix retains its original surface, but is specially prepared and/or inked to allow for the transfer of the image. Planographic techniques include [[lithography]], [[monotyping]], and digital techniques.\n* [[Stencil]], where ink or paint is pressed through a prepared screen, including [[screen printing]] and [[stencil|pochoir]].\n\nOther types of printmaking techniques outside these groups include [[collagraph]]y and [[viscosity printing]]. Collagraphy is a printmaking technique in which textured material is adhered to the printing matrix. This texture is transferred to the paper during the printing process. [[Printing#Modern printing technology|Contemporary printmaking]] may include [[digital printing]], photographic mediums, or a combination of digital, photographic, and traditional processes.\n\nMany of these techniques can also be combined, especially within the same family. For example, Rembrandt's prints are usually referred to as \"etchings\" for convenience, but very often include work in engraving and [[drypoint]] as well, and sometimes have no etching at all.\n\n=== Woodcut ===\n<div style=\"width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;\">Artists using this technique include\n[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]],\n[[Hans Burgkmair]],\n[[Ugo da Carpi]],\n[[Hiroshige]],\n[[Hokusai]],\n[[Frans Masereel]],\n[[Gustave Baumann]], \n[[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]],\n[[Eric Slater]]\n[[Antonio Frasconi]]\n</div>\n{{main|woodcut}}\n[[File:Vallotton-Raison.gif|thumb|[[F\u00e9lix Vallotton]], ''La raison probante (The Cogent Reason)'', [[woodcut]] from the series ''Intimit\u00e9s'', (1898)]]\n[[File:Kirchner - Bildnis Otto Mueller.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], ''Portrait of [[Otto Mueller|Otto M\u00fcller]]'', 1915]]\n\nWoodcut, a type of [[relief print]], is the earliest printmaking technique, and the only one traditionally used in the Far East. It was probably first developed as a means of printing patterns on cloth, and by the 5th century was used in China for printing text and images on paper. Woodcuts of images on paper developed around 1400 in Japan, and slightly later in Europe. These are the two areas where woodcut has been most extensively used purely as a process for making images without text.\n[[File:Some woodcutts of Stanislaw Raczynski.jpg|thumb|''Woodcuts of Stanislaw Raczynski (1903&ndash;1982)'']]\nThe [[artist]] draws a design on a plank of [[wood]], or on paper which is transferred to the wood. Traditionally the artist then handed the work to a specialist cutter, who then uses sharp tools to carve away the parts of the block that will not receive ink. The surface of the block is then inked with the use of a [[brayer]], and then a sheet of [[paper]], perhaps slightly damp, is placed over the block. The block is then rubbed with a [[Baren (printing tool)|baren]] or [[spoon]], or is run through a [[printing press]]. If in color, separate blocks can be used for each [[color]], or a technique called reduction printing can be used.\n\nReduction printing is a name used to describe the process of using one block to print several layers of color on one print. This usually involves cutting a small amount of the block away, and then printing the block many times over on different sheets before washing the block, cutting more away and printing the next color on top. This allows the previous color to show through. This process can be repeated many times over. The advantages of this process is that only one block is needed, and that different components of an intricate design will line up perfectly. The disadvantage is that once the artist moves on to the next layer, no more prints can be made.\n\nAnother variation of woodcut printmaking is the cukil technique, made famous by the [[Taring Padi]] underground community in Java, Indonesia. Taring Padi Posters usually resemble intricately printed cartoon posters embedded with political messages. Images\u2014usually resembling a visually complex scenario\u2014are carved unto a wooden surface called cukilan, then smothered with printer's ink before pressing it unto media such as paper or canvas.\n\n=== Engraving ===\n{{main|Engraving}}\n[[File:Melencolia I (Durero).jpg|thumb|upright|left|\"[[Melencolia I]]\", engraving by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], one of the most important printmakers.]]\nThe process was developed in Germany in the 1430s from the engraving used by [[goldsmith]]s to decorate metalwork.  Engravers use a hardened steel tool called a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] to cut the design into the surface of a metal plate, traditionally made of copper. Engraving using a burin is generally a difficult skill to learn.\n\nGravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. Other tools such as mezzotint rockers, roulettes (a tool with a fine-toothed wheel) and burnishers (a tool used for making an object smooth or shiny by rubbing) are used for texturing effects.\n\nTo make a print, the engraved plate is inked all over, then the ink is wiped off the surface, leaving only ink in the engraved lines. The plate is then put through a high-pressure printing press together with a sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it). The paper picks up the ink from the engraved lines, making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the printing plate shows much sign of wear, except when [[drypoint]], which gives much shallower lines, is used.\n\nIn the 20th century, true engraving was revived as a serious art form by artists including [[Stanley William Hayter]] whose [[Atelier 17]] in Paris and New York City became the magnet for such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Mauricio Lasansky]] and [[Joan Mir\u00f3]].\n\n=== Etching ===\n<div style=\"width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;\">Artists using this technique include [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], [[Francisco Goya]], [[Wenceslaus Hollar]], [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]], [[Otto Dix]], [[James Ensor]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Lucas van Leyden]].</div>\n{{main|Etching}}\n'''Etching''' is part of the [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] family (along with [[engraving]], [[drypoint]], [[mezzotint]], and [[aquatint]].) Although the first dated etching is by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] in 1515, the process is believed to have been invented by [[Daniel Hopfer]] (c.1470&ndash;1536) of Augsburg, Germany, who decorated armor in this way, and applied the method to printmaking.<ref>Cohen, Brian D. [http://artinprint.org/article/freedom-and-resistance-in-the-act-of-engraving-or-why-durer-gave-up-on-etching/ \"Freedom and Resistance in the Act of Engraving (or, Why D\u00fcrer Gave up on Etching),\"] ''Art in Print'' Vol. 7 No. 3 (September\u2013October 2017), 17.</ref> Etching soon came to challenge engraving as the most popular printmaking medium. Its great advantage was that, unlike engraving which requires special skill in metalworking, etching is relatively easy to learn for an artist trained in drawing.\n\nEtching prints are generally linear and often contain fine detail and contours. [[Line art|Lines]] can vary from smooth to sketchy. An etching is opposite of a woodcut in that the raised portions of an etching remain blank while the crevices hold ink. In pure etching, a metal (usually copper, zinc or steel) plate is covered with a waxy or acrylic ground. The artist then draws through the ground with a pointed etching needle. The exposed metal lines are then etched by dipping the plate in a bath of etchant (e.g. [[nitric acid]] or [[ferric chloride]]). The etchant \"bites\" into the exposed metal, leaving behind lines in the plate. The remaining ground is then cleaned off the plate, and the printing process is then just the same as for engraving.\n\n=== Mezzotint ===\n{{main|Mezzotint}}\nAn [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] variant of engraving in which the image is formed from subtle gradations of light and shade. Mezzotint\u2014from the Italian mezzo (\"half\") and tinta (\"tone\")\u2014is a \"dark manner\" form of printmaking, which requires artists to work from dark to light. To create a mezzotint, the surface of a copper printing plate is roughened evenly all over with the aid of a tool known as a rocker; the image is then formed by smoothing the surface with a tool known as a burnisher. When inked, the roughened areas of the plate will hold more ink and print more darkly, while smoother areas of the plate hold less or no ink, and will print more lightly or not at all. It is, however, possible to create the image by only roughening the plate selectively, so working from light to dark.\n\nMezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colors to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the texture with burin, burnisher and scraper allows fine gradations in tone to be developed.\n\nThe mezzotint printmaking method was invented by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] (1609\u20131680). The process was used widely in England from the mid-eighteenth century, to reproduce oil paintings and in particular portraits.\n\n=== Aquatint ===\n[[File:Goya-Capricho-43.jpg|thumb|upright|\"The sleep of Reason creates monsters\", etching and aquatint by [[Francisco Goya]]]]\n{{main|Aquatint}}\nA technique used in [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] etchings. Like etching, aquatint technique involves the application of acid to make marks in a metal plate. Where the etching technique uses a needle to make lines that retain ink, aquatint relies on powdered [[rosin]] which is acid resistant in the ground to create a tonal effect. The rosin is applied in a light dusting by a fan booth, the rosin is then cooked until set on the plate. At this time the rosin can be burnished or scratched out to affect its tonal qualities. The tonal variation is controlled by the level of acid exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.\n\nGoya used aquatint for most of his prints.\n\n=== Drypoint===\n{{main|Drypoint}}\n[[File:Rembrandt The Three Crosses 1653.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Three Crosses]]'', [[drypoint]] by [[Rembrandt]]]]\nA variant of engraving, done with a sharp point, rather than a v-shaped [[Burin (engraving)|burin]]. While engraved lines are very smooth and hard-edged, drypoint scratching leaves a rough burr at the edges of each line. This burr gives drypoint prints a characteristically soft, and sometimes blurry, line quality. Because the pressure of printing quickly destroys the burr, drypoint is useful only for very small editions; as few as ten or twenty impressions. To counter this, and allow for longer print runs, electro-plating (here called steelfacing) has been used since the nineteenth century to harden the surface of a plate.\n\nThe technique appears to have been invented by the [[Housebook Master]], a south German fifteenth-century artist, all of whose prints are in drypoint only. Among the most famous artists of the old master print: Albrecht D\u00fcrer produced three drypoints before abandoning the technique; Rembrandt used it frequently, but usually in conjunction with etching and engraving.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Lithography ===\n<div style=\"width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;\">Artists using this technique include\n[[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]],\n[[Vincent van Gogh]],\n[[George Bellows]],\n[[Pierre Bonnard]],\n[[Edvard Munch]],\n[[Emil Nolde]],\n[[Pablo Picasso]],\n[[Odilon Redon]],\n[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]],\n[[Salvador Dal\u00ed]],\n[[M.

[[Gum arabic]], a water-soluble substance, is then applied, sealing the surface of the stone not covered with the drawing medium.\nThe stone is wetted, with water staying only on the surface not covered in grease-based residue of the drawing; the stone is then 'rolled up', meaning oil ink is applied with a roller covering the entire surface; since water repels the oil in the ink, the ink adheres only to the greasy parts, perfectly inking the image.\nA sheet of dry paper is placed on the surface, and the image is transferred to the paper by the pressure of the printing press. Lithography is known for its ability to capture fine gradations in shading and very small detail.\n\nA variant is [[photo-lithography]], in which the image is captured by photographic processes on metal plates; printing is carried out in the same way.\n[[File:Rachael Robinson Elmer, Woolworth Building June Night, 1916, NGA 147751.jpg|alt=A gradient lithograph print of the Woolworth Building in New York in blue tones|thumb|Rachel Robinson Elmer, [[halftone]] [[Offset printing|offset lithograph]], [[Woolworth Building]] June Night, 1916, [[National Gallery of Art|The National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C. |center]]\nAnother variant is [[halftone]] lithography, in which the image produced illustrates a gradient-like quality.\n\n=== Screenprinting ===\n<div style=\"width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;\">Artists using this technique include\n[[Josef Albers]],\n[[Ralston Crawford]],\n[[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]].\n[[Robert Indiana]],\n[[Roy Lichtenstein]],\n[[Julian Opie]],\n[[Bridget Riley]],\n[[Edward Ruscha]],\n[[Andy Warhol]].\n</div>\n{{main|Screenprinting}}\n[[Screen printing]] (occasionally known as \"silkscreen\", or \"serigraphy\") creates prints by using a fabric stencil technique; ink is simply pushed through the stencil against the surface of the paper, most often with the aid of a squeegee. Generally, the technique uses a natural or synthetic 'mesh' fabric stretched tightly across a rectangular 'frame,' much like a stretched canvas. The fabric can be silk, nylon monofilament, multifilament polyester, or even stainless steel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://awt-gpi.com/product148.htm |title=Screen Fabric |website=A.W.T. World Trade Inc.}}</ref>  While commercial screen printing often requires high-tech, mechanical apparatuses and calibrated materials, printmakers value it for the \"Do It Yourself\" approach, and the low technical requirements, high quality results. The essential tools required are a squeegee, a mesh fabric, a frame, and a stencil. Unlike many other printmaking processes, a printing press is not required, as screen printing is essentially stencil printing.\n\nScreen printing may be adapted to printing on a variety of materials, from paper, cloth, and canvas to rubber, glass, and metal. Artists have used the technique to print on bottles, on slabs of granite, directly onto walls, and to reproduce images on textiles which would distort under pressure from printing presses.\n\n=== Monotype ===\n[[File:Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione - The Creation of Adam - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Monotype]] by the technique's inventor, [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], ''The Creation of Adam'', c 1642]]\n{{main|Monotyping}}\nMonotyping is a type of printmaking made by drawing or painting on a smooth, non-absorbent surface. The surface, or matrix, was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to acrylic glass. The image is then transferred onto a sheet of paper by pressing the two together, usually using a printing-press. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using brushes or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of opaque color. The inks used may be oil based or water based. With oil based inks, the paper may be dry, in which case the image has more contrast, or the paper may be damp, in which case the image has a 10 percent greater range of tones.\n[[File:Paul Gauguin, Arearea no Varua Ino (Words of the Devil) (recto), 1894, NGA 11586.jpg|alt=Watercolor monotype showing two women, one with her back to the viewer|left|thumb|[[Paul Gauguin]], ''Arearea no Varua Ino'' (Words of the Devil), [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] monotype on japan paper mounted on cardboard, 1894, [[National Gallery of Art|The National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.]]\nUnlike [[monoprinting]], monotyping produces a unique print, or monotype, because most of the ink is removed during the initial pressing. Although subsequent reprintings are sometimes possible, they differ greatly from the first print and are generally considered inferior. A second print from the original plate is called a \"ghost print\" or \"cognate\". Stencils, watercolor, solvents, brushes, and other tools are often used to embellish a monotype print. Monotypes are often spontaneously executed and with no preliminary sketch.\n\nMonotypes are the most painterly method among the printmaking techniques, a unique print that is essentially a printed painting. The principal characteristic of this medium is found in its spontaneity and its combination of printmaking, painting, and drawing media.<ref>[http://washingtonprintmakers.com/resources/techniques/monoprint Washington printmakers' gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228183408/http://washingtonprintmakers.com/resources/techniques/monoprint |date=2010-12-28 }}</ref>\n\n=== Monoprint ===\n{{main|Monoprinting}}\nMonoprinting is a form of printmaking that uses a matrix such as a woodblock, litho stone, or copper plate, but produces impressions that are unique. Multiple unique impressions printed from a single matrix are sometimes known as a variable edition. There are many techniques used in monoprinting, including [[collagraph]], [[collage]], hand-painted additions, and a form of tracing by which thick ink is laid down on a table, paper is placed on the ink, and the back of the paper is drawn on, transferring the ink to the paper. Monoprints can also be made by altering the type, color, and viscosity of the ink used to create different prints. Traditional printmaking techniques, such as lithography, woodcut, and intaglio, can be used to make monoprints.\n\n=== Mixed-media prints ===\nMixed-media prints may use multiple traditional printmaking processes such as etching, woodcut, letterpress, silkscreen, or even monoprinting in the creation of the print. They may also incorporate elements of chine colle, collage, or painted areas, and may be unique, i.e. one-off, non-editioned, prints. Mixed-media prints are often experimental prints and may be printed on unusual, non-traditional surfaces.\n\n=== Digital prints ===\n<div style=\"width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;\">Artists using this technique include\n[[Istvan Horkay]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Enrique Chagoya]]\n</div>\n{{main|Digital printing}}\nDigital prints refers to images printed using digital printers such as [[Inkjet printing|inkjet printers]] instead of a traditional printing press. Images can be printed to a variety of substrates including paper, cloth, or plastic canvas.\n\n====Dye-based inks====\nDye-based inks are [[organic compound|organic]] (not [[mineral]]) dissolved and mixed into a liquid. Although most are synthetic, derived from [[petroleum]], they can be made from vegetable or animal sources. Dyes are well suited for textiles where the liquid dye penetrates and chemically bonds to the fiber. Because of the deep penetration, more layers of material must lose their color before the fading is apparent. Dyes, however, are not suitable for the relatively thin layers of ink laid out on the surface of a print.\n\n====Pigment-based inks====\nPigment is a finely ground, particulate substance which, when mixed or ground into a liquid to make ink or paint, does not dissolve, but remains dispersed or suspended in the liquid. Pigments are categorized as either [[inorganic]] (mineral) or organic (synthetic).<ref name=\"MagnoliaFAQ\">[http://www.magnoliaeditions.com/pages/FAQs.htm Printmaking FAQ at Magnolia Editions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413021716/http://magnoliaeditions.com/pages/FAQs.htm |date=2009-04-13 }}</ref> Pigment-based inks have a much longer permanence than dye-based inks.<ref>Susan Carden, Digital Textile Printing, Bloomsbury Publishing - 2015, page 27</ref>\n\n====Gicl\u00e9e====\n[[Gicl\u00e9e]] (pron.: /\u0292i\u02d0\u02c8kle\u026a/ zhee-KLAY or /d\u0292i\u02d0\u02c8kle\u026a/), is a neologism coined in 1991 by printmaker Jack Duganne <ref>Johnson, Harald. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dq3Xj8zEYMIC&pg=PA11&dq=giclee+prints+produced+on+epson#PPA11,M1 ''Mastering Digital Printing'', p.11] at Google Books</ref> for digital prints made on inkjet printers.

Today fine art prints produced on large format ink-jet machines using the [[CcMmYK color model]] are generally called \"Gicl\u00e9e\".\n\n=== Foil imaging ===\nIn art, '''foil imaging''' is a printmaking technique made using the Iowa Foil Printer, developed by [[Virginia A. Myers]] from the commercial [[foil stamping]] process. This uses gold leaf and acrylic [[Foil (chemistry)|foil]] in the printmaking process.\n\n== Colour ==\n[[File:Mishima Asa-Giri-\u6771\u6d77\u9053\u4e94\u5341\u4e09\u6b21\u4e4b\u5185 \u4e09\u5cf6 \u671d\u9727-Morning Mist MET DP123235.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Morning Mist'']]\nPrintmakers apply color to their prints in many different ways. Some coloring techniques include positive surface roll, negative surface roll, and [[A la poup\u00e9e]]. Often color in printmaking that involves etching, [[screen printing]], woodcut, or [[linocut]] is applied by either using separate plates, blocks or screens or by using a reductionist approach. In multiple plate color techniques, a number of plates, screens or blocks are produced, each providing a different color. Each separate plate, screen, or block will be inked up in a different color and applied in a particular sequence to produce the entire picture. On average about three to four plates are produced, but there are occasions where a printmaker may use up to seven plates. Every application of another plate of color will interact with the color already applied to the paper, and this must be kept in mind when producing the separation of colors. The lightest colors are often applied first, and then darker colors successively until the darkest.\n\nThe reductionist approach to producing color is to start with a lino or wood block that is either blank or with a simple etching. Upon each printing of color the printmaker will then further cut into the lino or woodblock removing more material and then apply another color and reprint. Each successive removal of lino or wood from the block will expose the already printed color to the viewer of the print. Picasso is often cited as the inventor of reduction printmaking, although there is evidence of this method in use 25 years before Picasso's linocuts.<ref>http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/catalogues/bibliography/136140/bunbury-alisa-not-picassos-invention--a-foray-into.aspx</ref>\n\nThe [[subtractive color]] concept is also used in [[offset printing|offset]] or [[digital print]] and is present in bitmap or vectorial software in [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] or other color spaces.\n\n== Registration ==\nIn printmaking processes requiring more than one application of ink or other medium, the problem exists as to how to line up properly areas of an image to receive ink in each application. The most obvious example of this would be a multi-color image in which each color is applied in a separate step. The lining up of the results of each step in a multistep printmaking process is called \"registration.\" Proper registration results in the various components of an image being in their proper place. But, for artistic reasons, improper registration is not necessarily the ruination of an image.\n\nThis can vary considerably from process to process. It generally involves placing the substrate, generally paper, in correct alignment with the printmaking element that will be supplying it with coloration.<ref>http://www.nontoxicprint.com/perfectregistration.htm</ref>\n\n== Protective printmaking equipment ==\nProtective clothing is very important for printmakers who engage in etching and lithography (closed toed shoes and long pants). Whereas in the past printmakers put their plates in and out of acid baths with their bare hands, today printmakers use rubber gloves.  They also wear industrial [[respirator]]s for protection from caustic vapors. Most acid baths are built with ventilation hoods above them.\n\nProtective respirators and masks should have particle filters, particularly for aquatinting. As a part of the aquatinting process, a printmaker is often exposed to [[rosin]] powder.  Rosin is a serious health hazard, especially to printmakers who, in the past, simply used to hold their breath<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smidgeonpress.wordpress.com/2014/09/08/printmaking-101-applying-rosin-for-aquatint-using-a-rosin-box/|title=Printmaking 101: Applying Rosin for Aquatint (Using a Rosin Box)|last=Smidgeon|date=2014-09-09|website=SMIDGEON PRESS|language=en|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref>  using an aquatinting booth.\n\n== See also ==\n[[File:Rembrandt The Hundred Guilder Print.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rembrandt]], ''Christ Preaching'', ''([[Hundred Guilder Print|The Hundred Guilder print]])''; etching c.1648]] \n[[File:Saint Jerome in his Study LACMA M.2012.31 (1 of 2).jpg|thumb|right|Albrecht D\u00fcrer, ''Saint Jerome in his Study'', 1514.]]\n* [[Artist's proof]]\n* [[Banhua]], Chinese printmaking\n* [[Carborundum printmaking]]\n* [[Edition (printmaking)]]\n* [[Graphic design]]\n* [[Line engraving]]\n* [[List of Printmakers]]\n* [[Old master print]]\n* [[Shin hanga]]\n* [[Sosaku hanga]]\n* [[Ukiyo-e]]\n* [[Viscosity printing]]\n* [[Visual arts]]\n\n=== Printmakers by nationality ===\n* [[:Category:Engravers by nationality|Engravers by nationality]]\n* [[:Category:Etchers|Etchers by nationality]]\n* [[:Category:Printmakers|Printmakers by nationality]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.moma.org/whatisaprint What is a Print?], from the [[Museum of Modern Art]]\n* [[Bamber Gascoigne]]: ''How to Identify Prints: A Complete Guide to Manual and Mechanical Processes from Woodcut to Inkjet'' ({{ISBN|0-500-28480-6}})\n* [http://shakespeare-art-museum.com/Prints/Method.html Multi-Color Block Prints: Wood/Linoleum - Reduction Method Technique], by [[Hannah Tompkins (artist)|Hannah Tompkins]]\n* [http://prodalist.com/catalog-design-handbook/ Catalog Design Handbook] with Technics, visual ergonomics & printmaking glossary\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book | author=A.

Printmaking normally covers only the process of creating prints that have an element of originality, rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painting.  Except in the case of [[monotyping]], the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print.  Each print produced is considered an \"original\" work of art, and is correctly referred to as an \"impression\", not a \"copy\" (that means a different print copying the first, common in early printmaking).  Often impressions vary considerably, whether intentionally or not.  The images on most prints are created for that purpose, perhaps with a preparatory study such as a drawing.  A print that copies another work of art, especially a painting, is known as a \"reproductive print\".\n\nPrints are created by transferring ink from a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] to a sheet of paper or other material, by a variety of techniques. Common types of matrices include: metal plates, usually copper or zinc, or polymer plates and other thicker plastic sheets for [[engraving]] or [[etching]]; stone, aluminum, or polymer for [[lithography]]; blocks of wood for [[woodcut]]s and [[wood engraving]]s; and linoleum for [[linocut]]s. Screens made of silk or synthetic fabrics are used for the [[screen printing]] process. Other types of matrix substrates and related processes are discussed below.\n\nMultiple impressions printed from the same matrix form an [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]. Since the late 19th century, artists have generally signed individual impressions from an edition and often number the impressions to form a limited edition; the matrix is then destroyed so that no more prints can be produced. Prints may also be printed in book form, such as illustrated books or [[artist's book]]s.\n\n== Techniques ==\n{{external media | width = 300px | align = right | video1 = [https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history-basics/artists-materials-techniques/printmaking/v/moma-relief-printmaking Printmaking: Woodcuts and Engravings], [[Smarthistory]]}}\n\n=== Overview===\nPrintmaking techniques are generally divided into the following basic categories:\n* [[relief print|Relief]], where ink is applied to the original surface of the matrix. Relief techniques include [[woodcut]] or [[woodblock printing|woodblock]] as the Asian forms are usually known, [[wood engraving]], [[linocut]] and [[metalcut]].\n* [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]], where ink is applied beneath the original surface of the matrix. Intaglio techniques include [[engraving]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[aquatint]].\n* [[Planographic]], where the matrix retains its original surface, but is specially prepared and/or inked to allow for the transfer of the image. Planographic techniques include [[lithography]], [[monotyping]], and digital techniques.\n* [[Stencil]], where ink or paint is pressed through a prepared screen, including [[screen printing]] and [[stencil|pochoir]].\n\nOther types of printmaking techniques outside these groups include [[collagraph]]y and [[viscosity printing]]. Collagraphy is a printmaking technique in which textured material is adhered to the printing matrix. This texture is transferred to the paper during the printing process. [[Printing#Modern printing technology|Contemporary printmaking]] may include [[digital printing]], photographic mediums, or a combination of digital, photographic, and traditional processes.\n\nMany of these techniques can also be combined, especially within the same family. For example, Rembrandt's prints are usually referred to as \"etchings\" for convenience, but very often include work in engraving and [[drypoint]] as well, and sometimes have no etching at all.\n\n=== Woodcut ===\n<div style=\"width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;\">Artists using this technique include\n[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]],\n[[Hans Burgkmair]],\n[[Ugo da Carpi]],\n[[Hiroshige]],\n[[Hokusai]],\n[[Frans Masereel]],\n[[Gustave Baumann]], \n[[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]],\n[[Eric Slater]]\n[[Antonio Frasconi]]\n</div>\n{{main|woodcut}}\n[[File:Vallotton-Raison.gif|thumb|[[F\u00e9lix Vallotton]], ''La raison probante (The Cogent Reason)'', [[woodcut]] from the series ''Intimit\u00e9s'', (1898)]]\n[[File:Kirchner - Bildnis Otto Mueller.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], ''Portrait of [[Otto Mueller|Otto M\u00fcller]]'', 1915]]\n\nWoodcut, a type of [[relief print]], is the earliest printmaking technique, and the only one traditionally used in the Far East. It was probably first developed as a means of printing patterns on cloth, and by the 5th century was used in China for printing text and images on paper. Woodcuts of images on paper developed around 1400 in Japan, and slightly later in Europe. These are the two areas where woodcut has been most extensively used purely as a process for making images without text.\n[[File:Some woodcutts of Stanislaw Raczynski.jpg|thumb|''Woodcuts of Stanislaw Raczynski (1903&ndash;1982)'']]\nThe [[artist]] draws a design on a plank of [[wood]], or on paper which is transferred to the wood. Traditionally the artist then handed the work to a specialist cutter, who then uses sharp tools to carve away the parts of the block that will not receive ink. The surface of the block is then inked with the use of a [[brayer]], and then a sheet of [[paper]], perhaps slightly damp, is placed over the block. The block is then rubbed with a [[Baren (printing tool)|baren]] or [[spoon]], or is run through a [[printing press]]. If in color, separate blocks can be used for each [[color]], or a technique called reduction printing can be used.\n\nReduction printing is a name used to describe the process of using one block to print several layers of color on one print. This usually involves cutting a small amount of the block away, and then printing the block many times over on different sheets before washing the block, cutting more away and printing the next color on top. This allows the previous color to show through. This process can be repeated many times over. The advantages of this process is that only one block is needed, and that different components of an intricate design will line up perfectly. The disadvantage is that once the artist moves on to the next layer, no more prints can be made.\n\nAnother variation of woodcut printmaking is the cukil technique, made famous by the [[Taring Padi]] underground community in Java, Indonesia. Taring Padi Posters usually resemble intricately printed cartoon posters embedded with political messages. Images\u2014usually resembling a visually complex scenario\u2014are carved unto a wooden surface called cukilan, then smothered with printer's ink before pressing it unto media such as paper or canvas.\n\n=== Engraving ===\n{{main|Engraving}}\n[[File:Melencolia I (Durero).jpg|thumb|upright|left|\"[[Melencolia I]]\", engraving by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], one of the most important printmakers.]]\nThe process was developed in Germany in the 1430s from the engraving used by [[goldsmith]]s to decorate metalwork.  Engravers use a hardened steel tool called a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] to cut the design into the surface of a metal plate, traditionally made of copper. Engraving using a burin is generally a difficult skill to learn.\n\nGravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. Other tools such as mezzotint rockers, roulettes (a tool with a fine-toothed wheel) and burnishers (a tool used for making an object smooth or shiny by rubbing) are used for texturing effects.\n\nTo make a print, the engraved plate is inked all over, then the ink is wiped off the surface, leaving only ink in the engraved lines. The plate is then put through a high-pressure printing press together with a sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it). The paper picks up the ink from the engraved lines, making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the printing plate shows much sign of wear, except when [[drypoint]], which gives much shallower lines, is used.\n\nIn the 20th century, true engraving was revived as a serious art form by artists including [[Stanley William Hayter]] whose [[Atelier 17]] in Paris and New York City became the magnet for such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Mauricio Lasansky]] and [[Joan Mir\u00f3]].\n\n=== Etching ===\n<div style=\"width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;\">Artists using this technique include [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], [[Francisco Goya]], [[Wenceslaus Hollar]], [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]], [[Otto Dix]], [[James Ensor]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Lucas van Leyden]].</div>\n{{main|Etching}}\n'''Etching''' is part of the [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] family (along with [[engraving]], [[drypoint]], [[mezzotint]], and [[aquatint]].) Although the first dated etching is by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] in 1515, the process is believed to have been invented by [[Daniel Hopfer]] (c.1470&ndash;1536) of Augsburg, Germany, who decorated armor in this way, and applied the method to printmaking.<ref>Cohen, Brian D. [http://artinprint.org/article/freedom-and-resistance-in-the-act-of-engraving-or-why-durer-gave-up-on-etching/ \"Freedom and Resistance in the Act of Engraving (or, Why D\u00fcrer Gave up on Etching),\"] ''Art in Print'' Vol. 7 No. 3 (September\u2013October 2017), 17.</ref> Etching soon came to challenge engraving as the most popular printmaking medium. Its great advantage was that, unlike engraving which requires special skill in metalworking, etching is relatively easy to learn for an artist trained in drawing.\n\nEtching prints are generally linear and often contain fine detail and contours. [[Line art|Lines]] can vary from smooth to sketchy. An etching is opposite of a woodcut in that the raised portions of an etching remain blank while the crevices hold ink. In pure etching, a metal (usually copper, zinc or steel) plate is covered with a waxy or acrylic ground. The artist then draws through the ground with a pointed etching needle. The exposed metal lines are then etched by dipping the plate in a bath of etchant (e.g. [[nitric acid]] or [[ferric chloride]]). The etchant \"bites\" into the exposed metal, leaving behind lines in the plate. The remaining ground is then cleaned off the plate, and the printing process is then just the same as for engraving.\n\n=== Mezzotint ===\n{{main|Mezzotint}}\nAn [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] variant of engraving in which the image is formed from subtle gradations of light and shade. Mezzotint\u2014from the Italian mezzo (\"half\") and tinta (\"tone\")\u2014is a \"dark manner\" form of printmaking, which requires artists to work from dark to light. To create a mezzotint, the surface of a copper printing plate is roughened evenly all over with the aid of a tool known as a rocker; the image is then formed by smoothing the surface with a tool known as a burnisher. When inked, the roughened areas of the plate will hold more ink and print more darkly, while smoother areas of the plate hold less or no ink, and will print more lightly or not at all. It is, however, possible to create the image by only roughening the plate selectively, so working from light to dark.\n\nMezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colors to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the texture with burin, burnisher and scraper allows fine gradations in tone to be developed.\n\nThe mezzotint printmaking method was invented by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] (1609\u20131680). The process was used widely in England from the mid-eighteenth century, to reproduce oil paintings and in particular portraits.\n\n=== Aquatint ===\n[[File:Goya-Capricho-43.jpg|thumb|upright|\"The sleep of Reason creates monsters\", etching and aquatint by [[Francisco Goya]]]]\n{{main|Aquatint}}\nA technique used in [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] etchings. Like etching, aquatint technique involves the application of acid to make marks in a metal plate. Where the etching technique uses a needle to make lines that retain ink, aquatint relies on powdered [[rosin]] which is acid resistant in the ground to create a tonal effect. The rosin is applied in a light dusting by a fan booth, the rosin is then cooked until set on the plate. At this time the rosin can be burnished or scratched out to affect its tonal qualities. The tonal variation is controlled by the level of acid exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.\n\nGoya used aquatint for most of his prints.\n\n=== Drypoint===\n{{main|Drypoint}}\n[[File:Rembrandt The Three Crosses 1653.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Three Crosses]]'', [[drypoint]] by [[Rembrandt]]]]\nA variant of engraving, done with a sharp point, rather than a v-shaped [[Burin (engraving)|burin]]. While engraved lines are very smooth and hard-edged, drypoint scratching leaves a rough burr at the edges of each line. This burr gives drypoint prints a characteristically soft, and sometimes blurry, line quality. Because the pressure of printing quickly destroys the burr, drypoint is useful only for very small editions; as few as ten or twenty impressions. To counter this, and allow for longer print runs, electro-plating (here called steelfacing) has been used since the nineteenth century to harden the surface of a plate.\n\nThe technique appears to have been invented by the [[Housebook Master]], a south German fifteenth-century artist, all of whose prints are in drypoint only. Among the most famous artists of the old master print: Albrecht D\u00fcrer produced three drypoints before abandoning the technique; Rembrandt used it frequently, but usually in conjunction with etching and engraving.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Lithography ===\n<div style=\"width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;\">Artists using this technique include\n[[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]],\n[[Vincent van Gogh]],\n[[George Bellows]],\n[[Pierre Bonnard]],\n[[Edvard Munch]],\n[[Emil Nolde]],\n[[Pablo Picasso]],\n[[Odilon Redon]],\n[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]],\n[[Salvador Dal\u00ed]],\n[[M.

[[Gum arabic]], a water-soluble substance, is then applied, sealing the surface of the stone not covered with the drawing medium.\nThe stone is wetted, with water staying only on the surface not covered in grease-based residue of the drawing; the stone is then 'rolled up', meaning oil ink is applied with a roller covering the entire surface; since water repels the oil in the ink, the ink adheres only to the greasy parts, perfectly inking the image.\nA sheet of dry paper is placed on the surface, and the image is transferred to the paper by the pressure of the printing press. Lithography is known for its ability to capture fine gradations in shading and very small detail.\n\nA variant is [[photo-lithography]], in which the image is captured by photographic processes on metal plates; printing is carried out in the same way.\n[[File:Rachael Robinson Elmer, Woolworth Building June Night, 1916, NGA 147751.jpg|alt=A gradient lithograph print of the Woolworth Building in New York in blue tones|thumb|Rachel Robinson Elmer, [[halftone]] [[Offset printing|offset lithograph]], [[Woolworth Building]] June Night, 1916, [[National Gallery of Art|The National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C. |center]]\nAnother variant is [[halftone]] lithography, in which the image produced illustrates a gradient-like quality.\n\n=== Screenprinting ===\n<div style=\"width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;\">Artists using this technique include\n[[Josef Albers]],\n[[Ralston Crawford]],\n[[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]].\n[[Robert Indiana]],\n[[Roy Lichtenstein]],\n[[Julian Opie]],\n[[Bridget Riley]],\n[[Edward Ruscha]],\n[[Andy Warhol]].\n</div>\n{{main|Screenprinting}}\n[[Screen printing]] (occasionally known as \"silkscreen\", or \"serigraphy\") creates prints by using a fabric stencil technique; ink is simply pushed through the stencil against the surface of the paper, most often with the aid of a squeegee. Generally, the technique uses a natural or synthetic 'mesh' fabric stretched tightly across a rectangular 'frame,' much like a stretched canvas. The fabric can be silk, nylon monofilament, multifilament polyester, or even stainless steel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://awt-gpi.com/product148.htm |title=Screen Fabric |website=A.W.T. World Trade Inc.}}</ref>  While commercial screen printing often requires high-tech, mechanical apparatuses and calibrated materials, printmakers value it for the \"Do It Yourself\" approach, and the low technical requirements, high quality results. The essential tools required are a squeegee, a mesh fabric, a frame, and a stencil. Unlike many other printmaking processes, a printing press is not required, as screen printing is essentially stencil printing.\n\nScreen printing may be adapted to printing on a variety of materials, from paper, cloth, and canvas to rubber, glass, and metal. Artists have used the technique to print on bottles, on slabs of granite, directly onto walls, and to reproduce images on textiles which would distort under pressure from printing presses.\n\n=== Monotype ===\n[[File:Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione - The Creation of Adam - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Monotype]] by the technique's inventor, [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], ''The Creation of Adam'', c 1642]]\n{{main|Monotyping}}\nMonotyping is a type of printmaking made by drawing or painting on a smooth, non-absorbent surface. The surface, or matrix, was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to acrylic glass. The image is then transferred onto a sheet of paper by pressing the two together, usually using a printing-press. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using brushes or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of opaque color. The inks used may be oil based or water based. With oil based inks, the paper may be dry, in which case the image has more contrast, or the paper may be damp, in which case the image has a 10 percent greater range of tones.\n[[File:Paul Gauguin, Arearea no Varua Ino (Words of the Devil) (recto), 1894, NGA 11586.jpg|alt=Watercolor monotype showing two women, one with her back to the viewer|left|thumb|[[Paul Gauguin]], ''Arearea no Varua Ino'' (Words of the Devil), [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] monotype on japan paper mounted on cardboard, 1894, [[National Gallery of Art|The National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.]]\nUnlike [[monoprinting]], monotyping produces a unique print, or monotype, because most of the ink is removed during the initial pressing. Although subsequent reprintings are sometimes possible, they differ greatly from the first print and are generally considered inferior. A second print from the original plate is called a \"ghost print\" or \"cognate\". Stencils, watercolor, solvents, brushes, and other tools are often used to embellish a monotype print. Monotypes are often spontaneously executed and with no preliminary sketch.\n\nMonotypes are the most painterly method among the printmaking techniques, a unique print that is essentially a printed painting. The principal characteristic of this medium is found in its spontaneity and its combination of printmaking, painting, and drawing media.<ref>[http://washingtonprintmakers.com/resources/techniques/monoprint Washington printmakers' gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228183408/http://washingtonprintmakers.com/resources/techniques/monoprint |date=2010-12-28 }}</ref>\n\n=== Monoprint ===\n{{main|Monoprinting}}\nMonoprinting is a form of printmaking that uses a matrix such as a woodblock, litho stone, or copper plate, but produces impressions that are unique. Multiple unique impressions printed from a single matrix are sometimes known as a variable edition. There are many techniques used in monoprinting, including [[collagraph]], [[collage]], hand-painted additions, and a form of tracing by which thick ink is laid down on a table, paper is placed on the ink, and the back of the paper is drawn on, transferring the ink to the paper. Monoprints can also be made by altering the type, color, and viscosity of the ink used to create different prints. Traditional printmaking techniques, such as lithography, woodcut, and intaglio, can be used to make monoprints.\n\n=== Mixed-media prints ===\nMixed-media prints may use multiple traditional printmaking processes such as etching, woodcut, letterpress, silkscreen, or even monoprinting in the creation of the print. They may also incorporate elements of chine colle, collage, or painted areas, and may be unique, i.e. one-off, non-editioned, prints. Mixed-media prints are often experimental prints and may be printed on unusual, non-traditional surfaces.\n\n=== Digital prints ===\n<div style=\"width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #8888aa;\">Artists using this technique include\n[[Istvan Horkay]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Enrique Chagoya]]\n</div>\n{{main|Digital printing}}\nDigital prints refers to images printed using digital printers such as [[Inkjet printing|inkjet printers]] instead of a traditional printing press. Images can be printed to a variety of substrates including paper, cloth, or plastic canvas.\n\n====Dye-based inks====\nDye-based inks are [[organic compound|organic]] (not [[mineral]]) dissolved and mixed into a liquid. Although most are synthetic, derived from [[petroleum]], they can be made from vegetable or animal sources. Dyes are well suited for textiles where the liquid dye penetrates and chemically bonds to the fiber. Because of the deep penetration, more layers of material must lose their color before the fading is apparent. Dyes, however, are not suitable for the relatively thin layers of ink laid out on the surface of a print.\n\n====Pigment-based inks====\nPigment is a finely ground, particulate substance which, when mixed or ground into a liquid to make ink or paint, does not dissolve, but remains dispersed or suspended in the liquid. Pigments are categorized as either [[inorganic]] (mineral) or organic (synthetic).<ref name=\"MagnoliaFAQ\">[http://www.magnoliaeditions.com/pages/FAQs.htm Printmaking FAQ at Magnolia Editions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413021716/http://magnoliaeditions.com/pages/FAQs.htm |date=2009-04-13 }}</ref> Pigment-based inks have a much longer permanence than dye-based inks.<ref>Susan Carden, Digital Textile Printing, Bloomsbury Publishing - 2015, page 27</ref>\n\n====Gicl\u00e9e====\n[[Gicl\u00e9e]] (pron.: /\u0292i\u02d0\u02c8kle\u026a/ zhee-KLAY or /d\u0292i\u02d0\u02c8kle\u026a/), is a neologism coined in 1991 by printmaker Jack Duganne <ref>Johnson, Harald.

Today fine art prints produced on large format ink-jet machines using the [[CcMmYK color model]] are generally called \"Gicl\u00e9e\".\n\n=== Foil imaging ===\nIn art, '''foil imaging''' is a printmaking technique made using the Iowa Foil Printer, developed by [[Virginia A. Myers]] from the commercial [[foil stamping]] process. This uses gold leaf and acrylic [[Foil (chemistry)|foil]] in the printmaking process.\n\n== Color ==\n[[File:Mishima Asa-Giri-\u6771\u6d77\u9053\u4e94\u5341\u4e09\u6b21\u4e4b\u5185 \u4e09\u5cf6 \u671d\u9727-Morning Mist MET DP123235.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Morning Mist'']]\nPrintmakers apply color to their prints in many different ways. Some coloring techniques include positive surface roll, negative surface roll, and [[A la poup\u00e9e]]. Often color in printmaking that involves etching, [[screen printing]], woodcut, or [[linocut]] is applied by either using separate plates, blocks or screens or by using a reductionist approach. In multiple plate color techniques, a number of plates, screens or blocks are produced, each providing a different color. Each separate plate, screen, or block will be inked up in a different color and applied in a particular sequence to produce the entire picture. On average about three to four plates are produced, but there are occasions where a printmaker may use up to seven plates. Every application of another plate of color will interact with the color already applied to the paper, and this must be kept in mind when producing the separation of colors. The lightest colors are often applied first, and then darker colors successively until the darkest.\n\nThe reductionist approach to producing color is to start with a lino or wood block that is either blank or with a simple etching. Upon each printing of color the printmaker will then further cut into the lino or woodblock removing more material and then apply another color and reprint. Each successive removal of lino or wood from the block will expose the already printed color to the viewer of the print. Picasso is often cited as the inventor of reduction printmaking, although there is evidence of this method in use 25 years before Picasso's linocuts.<ref>http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/catalogues/bibliography/136140/bunbury-alisa-not-picassos-invention--a-foray-into.aspx</ref>\n\nThe [[subtractive color]] concept is also used in [[offset printing|offset]] or [[digital print]] and is present in bitmap or vectorial software in [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] or other color spaces.\n\n== Registration ==\nIn printmaking processes requiring more than one application of ink or other medium, the problem exists as to how to line up properly areas of an image to receive ink in each application. The most obvious example of this would be a multi-color image in which each color is applied in a separate step. The lining up of the results of each step in a multistep printmaking process is called \"registration.\" Proper registration results in the various components of an image being in their proper place. But, for artistic reasons, improper registration is not necessarily the ruination of an image.\n\nThis can vary considerably from process to process. It generally involves placing the substrate, generally paper, in correct alignment with the printmaking element that will be supplying it with coloration.<ref>http://www.nontoxicprint.com/perfectregistration.htm</ref>\n\n== Protective printmaking equipment ==\nProtective clothing is very important for printmakers who engage in etching and lithography (closed toed shoes and long pants). Whereas in the past printmakers put their plates in and out of acid baths with their bare hands, today printmakers use rubber gloves.  They also wear industrial [[respirator]]s for protection from caustic vapors. Most acid baths are built with ventilation hoods above them.\n\nProtective respirators and masks should have particle filters, particularly for aquatinting. As a part of the aquatinting process, a printmaker is often exposed to [[rosin]] powder.  Rosin is a serious health hazard, especially to printmakers who, in the past, simply used to hold their breath<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smidgeonpress.wordpress.com/2014/09/08/printmaking-101-applying-rosin-for-aquatint-using-a-rosin-box/|title=Printmaking 101: Applying Rosin for Aquatint (Using a Rosin Box)|last=Smidgeon|date=2014-09-09|website=SMIDGEON PRESS|language=en|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref>  using an aquatinting booth.\n\n== See also ==\n[[File:Rembrandt The Hundred Guilder Print.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rembrandt]], ''Christ Preaching'', ''([[Hundred Guilder Print|The Hundred Guilder print]])''; etching c.1648]] \n[[File:Saint Jerome in his Study LACMA M.2012.31 (1 of 2).jpg|thumb|right|Albrecht D\u00fcrer, ''Saint Jerome in his Study'', 1514.]]\n* [[Artist's proof]]\n* [[Banhua]], Chinese printmaking\n* [[Carborundum printmaking]]\n* [[Edition (printmaking)]]\n* [[Graphic design]]\n* [[Line engraving]]\n* [[List of Printmakers]]\n* [[Old master print]]\n* [[Shin hanga]]\n* [[Sosaku hanga]]\n* [[Ukiyo-e]]\n* [[Viscosity printing]]\n* [[Visual arts]]\n\n=== Printmakers by nationality ===\n* [[:Category:Engravers by nationality|Engravers by nationality]]\n* [[:Category:Etchers|Etchers by nationality]]\n* [[:Category:Printmakers|Printmakers by nationality]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.moma.org/whatisaprint What is a Print?], from the [[Museum of Modern Art]]\n* [[Bamber Gascoigne]]: ''How to Identify Prints: A Complete Guide to Manual and Mechanical Processes from Woodcut to Inkjet'' ({{ISBN|0-500-28480-6}})\n* [http://shakespeare-art-museum.com/Prints/Method.html Multi-Color Block Prints: Wood/Linoleum - Reduction Method Technique], by [[Hannah Tompkins (artist)|Hannah Tompkins]]\n* [http://prodalist.com/catalog-design-handbook/ Catalog Design Handbook] with Technics, visual ergonomics & printmaking glossary\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book | author=A.

In the 1970s, French people were consuming an average of one loaf of bread per day. Only a century ago, the French ate approximately 3 loaves of bread per day. Today, French people eat only a half a loaf of bread per day. In response to this decline, bakers have created a national campaign to get people to call at the bakery before and after work just as they used to. The campaign models the American \"Got Milk?\" campaign, plastering \"Hey there, have you picked up the bread?\" all over billboards and bread bags.<ref>Kim, Eun Kyung (6 August 2013) [http://www.today.com/news/mon-dieu-new-campaign-urges-french-eat-more-bread-6C10855685 Mon dieu!

By supplying a sufficient amount of bread to the people, the government was able to demonstrate its strong political fitness. Wheaten bread was also thought to be indispensable to one's well-being after French medical chemists had associated gluten with several nourishing elements in plants. As bread had a high gluten content compared to other cereals, it was given a reputation of being the alimentary ideal. Consequently, consumers became extremely concerned with the quality of their wheaten bread, resulting in a meticulous surveillance of wheaten bread production; they did not want their bread to contain filler additives such as bran, rye, barley, and legume flour. At the time, bread was the most sought out food as it was considered to be essential, universal, and highly nutritive. It was typical for the average French citizen to believe that it was impossible to overindulge in bread. For many, bread became the centerpiece of every meal. All other foods such as fruits, vegetables, and meats were thought as subsidiary, or ancillary to nourishment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spary|first1=Emma|title=Feeding France: New Sciences of Food, 1760\u20131815|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107031050|pages=55\u201368}}</ref>\n\nThere is a wide variety of traditional breads in [[Great Britain]], often baked in a rectangular tin form.

There are many variations on bread rolls, such as [[bap (bread)|bap]]s, [[barm]]s, [[breadcake]]s and so on. The [[Chorleywood process]] for mass-producing bread was developed in England in the 1960s before spreading worldwide.

Rolls, made from wheat flour and yeast, are another popular and traditional bread, eaten with the dinner meal.\n\n[[Cornbread]] is made from cornmeal and can differ significantly in taste and texture from region to region. In general, the [[Southern United States|South]] prefers white cornmeal with little to no wheat flour or sweeteners added; it is traditionally baked in a cast-iron skillet and ideally has a crunchy outside and moist inside. The [[Northern United States|North]] usually prefers yellow cornmeal with sometimes as much as half wheat flour in its composition, as well as sugar, honey, or maple syrup. This results in a bread that is softer and sweeter than its southern counterpart. Wheat flour was not available to the average North American family until the early 1900s when a new breed of wheat termed [[Red Fife wheat|Marquis]] was produced. This was a hybrid of Red Fife and [[Hard red winter wheat]]. Marquis grew well and soon average Americans were able to have homemade wheat bread on the table.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Solomon|title=Charles Scribner's Sons,|publisher=Gale|location=New York|pages=531|edition=Vol 3}}</ref> Homemade wheat breads are made in a rectangular tin similar to those in the United Kingdom.\n\nSpoon bread, also called batter bread or egg bread, is made of cornmeal with or without added rice and hominy, and is mixed with milk, eggs, shortening and leavening to such a consistency that it must be served from the baking dish with a spoon. This is popular chiefly in the South.\n\nSourdough biscuits are traditional \"cowboy food\" in the [[Western United States|West]]. The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] is known for its crusty [[sourdough]].\n\nUp until the 20th century (and even later in certain regions), any flour other than cornmeal was considered a luxury; this would explain the greater variety in cornbread types compared to that of wheat breads. In terms of commercial manufacture, the most popular bread has been a soft-textured type with a thin crust that is usually made with milk and is slightly sweet; this is the type that is generally sold ready-sliced in packages. It is usually eaten with the crust, but some eaters or preparers may remove the crust due to a personal preference or style of serving, as with finger sandwiches served with [[afternoon tea]]. Some of the softest bread, including [[Wonder Bread]], is referred to as \"balloon bread\".\n\nThough white \"[[sandwich bread]]\" is the most popular, Americans are trending toward more [[artisanal]] breads. Different regions of the country feature certain ethnic bread varieties including the Ashkenazi Jewish [[bagel]], the French [[baguette]], the Italian-style [[scali bread]] made in [[New England]], Jewish rye, commonly associated with [[delicatessen]] cuisine, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[frybread]] (a product of hardship, developed during the Indian resettlements of the 19th century).\n\n== Religious significance ==\n[[File:Methodistcommunion6.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Eucharist]] (also called Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper) is considered a sacrament, ordinance, or equivalent in most Christian denominations.]]\n{{see also|Baking#Cultural and religious significance}}\n\n===Abrahamic religions===\n\nBread has symbolic roles in the [[Abrahamic religions]] of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]].

Steamed ''mantou'' is similar to Western white bread, but since it is not baked it does not have a brown outer crust. ''Mantou'' that have a filling such as meat or vegetables ([[cha siu bao]], for example) are called ''[[baozi]]''.

In the 1970s, French people were consuming an average of one loaf of bread per day. Only a century ago, the French ate approximately 3 loaves of bread per day. Today, French people eat only a half a loaf of bread per day. In response to this decline, bakers have created a national campaign to get people to call at the bakery before and after work just as they used to. The campaign models the American \"Got Milk?\" campaign, plastering \"Hey there, have you picked up the bread?\" all over billboards and bread bags.<ref>Kim, Eun Kyung (6 August 2013) [http://www.today.com/news/mon-dieu-new-campaign-urges-french-eat-more-bread-6C10855685 Mon dieu!

By supplying a sufficient amount of bread to the people, the government was able to demonstrate its strong political fitness. Wheaten bread was also thought to be indispensable to one's well-being after French medical chemists had associated gluten with several nourishing elements in plants. As bread had a high gluten content compared to other cereals, it was given a reputation of being the alimentary ideal. Consequently, consumers became extremely concerned with the quality of their wheaten bread, resulting in a meticulous surveillance of wheaten bread production; they did not want their bread to contain filler additives such as bran, rye, barley, and legume flour. At the time, bread was the most sought out food as it was considered to be essential, universal, and highly nutritive. It was typical for the average French citizen to believe that it was impossible to overindulge in bread. For many, bread became the centerpiece of every meal. All other foods such as fruits, vegetables, and meats were thought as subsidiary, or ancillary to nourishment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spary|first1=Emma|title=Feeding France: New Sciences of Food, 1760\u20131815|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107031050|pages=55\u201368}}</ref>\n\nThere is a wide variety of traditional breads in [[Great Britain]], often baked in a rectangular tin form. Round loaves are also produced, such as the [[North East England]] specialty called a [[stottie cake]]. A cob is a small round loaf. A [[cottage loaf]] is made of two balls of dough, one on top of the other, to form a figure-of-eight shape. There are many variations on bread rolls, such as [[bap (bread)|bap]]s, [[barm]]s, [[breadcake]]s and so on. The [[Chorleywood process]] for mass-producing bread was developed in England in the 1960s before spreading worldwide. Mass-produced sliced white bread brands such as [[Wonderloaf]] and [[Mother's Pride]] have been criticized on grounds of poor nutritional value and taste of the loaves produced.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13670278 Chorleywood, the Bread that Changed Britain].

One can buy it freshly made every morning in the traditional bakeries, where there is a large assortment of bread. A smaller version is known as [[bocadillo]], an iconic piece of the Hispanic cuisine. In Spain, especially in the Mediterranean area, there have been guilds of bakers for over 750 years.

Rolls, made from wheat flour and yeast, are another popular and traditional bread, eaten with the dinner meal.\n\n[[Cornbread]] is made from cornmeal and can differ significantly in taste and texture from region to region. In general, the [[Southern United States|South]] prefers white cornmeal with little to no wheat flour or sweeteners added; it is traditionally baked in a cast-iron skillet and ideally has a crunchy outside and moist inside. The [[Northern United States|North]] usually prefers yellow cornmeal with sometimes as much as half wheat flour in its composition, as well as sugar, honey, or maple syrup. This results in a bread that is softer and sweeter than its southern counterpart. Wheat flour was not available to the average North American family until the early 1900s when a new breed of wheat termed [[Red Fife wheat|Marquis]] was produced. This was a hybrid of Red Fife and [[Hard red winter wheat]]. Marquis grew well and soon average Americans were able to have homemade wheat bread on the table.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Solomon|title=Charles Scribner's Sons,|publisher=Gale|location=New York|pages=531|edition=Vol 3}}</ref> Homemade wheat breads are made in a rectangular tin similar to those in the United Kingdom.\n\nSpoon bread, also called batter bread or egg bread, is made of cornmeal with or without added rice and hominy, and is mixed with milk, eggs, shortening and leavening to such a consistency that it must be served from the baking dish with a spoon. This is popular chiefly in the South.\n\nSourdough biscuits are traditional \"cowboy food\" in the [[Western United States|West]]. The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] is known for its crusty [[sourdough]].\n\nUp until the 20th century (and even later in certain regions), any flour other than cornmeal was considered a luxury; this would explain the greater variety in cornbread types compared to that of wheat breads. In terms of commercial manufacture, the most popular bread has been a soft-textured type with a thin crust that is usually made with milk and is slightly sweet; this is the type that is generally sold ready-sliced in packages. It is usually eaten with the crust, but some eaters or preparers may remove the crust due to a personal preference or style of serving, as with finger sandwiches served with [[afternoon tea]]. Some of the softest bread, including [[Wonder Bread]], is referred to as \"balloon bread\".\n\nThough white \"[[sandwich bread]]\" is the most popular, Americans are trending toward more [[artisanal]] breads. Different regions of the country feature certain ethnic bread varieties including the Ashkenazi Jewish [[bagel]], the French [[baguette]], the Italian-style [[scali bread]] made in [[New England]], Jewish rye, commonly associated with [[delicatessen]] cuisine, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[frybread]] (a product of hardship, developed during the Indian resettlements of the 19th century).\n\n== Religious significance ==\n[[File:Methodistcommunion6.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Eucharist]] (also called Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper) is considered a sacrament, ordinance, or equivalent in most Christian denominations.]]\n{{see also|Baking#Cultural and religious significance}}\n\n===Abrahamic religions===\n\nBread has symbolic roles in the [[Abrahamic religions]] of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]].

After a four-month investigation, ''[[LA Weekly]]'' [[investigative journalism|investigative reporter]] Christine Pelisek broke the news of the task force's existence, the link between Peters' killing and the earlier murders, and the silence of [[Mayor of Los Angeles|Mayor]] [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] and Police Chief [[William J.

They found similar DNA belonging to Franklin's son, Christopher, who had been convicted of a [[felony]] weapons charge. According to Cooley, detectives then used a piece of discarded pizza with Franklin's DNA to make the link.<ref name=yahoonews1/>\n\nOne undercover police officer pretended to be a waiter at a restaurant where Franklin ate, collecting dishes, silverware, glasses, and pizza crusts to obtain DNA.<ref name=yahoonews1/> The identification was used to arrest Franklin after his DNA was obtained and deemed a match.<ref name=CNN1/> Saliva found on the victims established a DNA match linking Franklin to the deaths.<ref name=abcnews1/>\n\nLaw enforcement missed an opportunity to catch Franklin because his DNA was not previously collected. In 2003, Franklin was convicted of a felony and was serving three years of supervised [[probation]]. In 2004, voters passed [[California Proposition 69 (2004)|Proposition 69]], which requires that DNA must be collected from all felons and everyone arrested on some specified charges. It also requires the expansion of the DNA database. Authorities collected and sorted through thousands of DNA samples. While he was on probation, Franklin's DNA was supposed to be entered in the system but was not as probation officers did not collect samples from people who were on unsupervised probation between November 2004 and August 2005. The probation department did not have the resources to collect samples until August 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/15/local/la-me-grim-sleeper-dna-20100715|title=Authorities Missed A Chance to Catch Grim Sleeper Suspect|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-07-15|accessdate=2010-07-23|first=Jack|last=Leonard}}</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 2010, the LAPD released 180 photos of women, found in Franklin's home after unsuccessful attempts to identify the individuals, possibly additional victims. \"These people are not suspects, we don't even know if they are victims, but we do know this: Lonnie Franklin's reign of terror in the city of Los Angeles, which spanned well over two decades, culminating with almost a dozen murder victims, certainly needs to be investigated further,\" said Police Chief [[Charlie Beck]].<ref name=reuters1/>\n\nIn all, investigators found over 1,000 photos and several hundred hours of video in his home.<ref name=reuters1>{{cite news |last=Whitcomb |first=Dan |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BF6EU20101216 |title=L.A. police release photos of possible Grim Sleeper victims |publisher=Reuters |date= 2010-12-16|accessdate=2010-12-18}}</ref> The images show mainly black women of a wide age range, from teenagers to middle-aged and older, often nude.

In some cases, ''LA Weekly'' was the first to inform the families that their daughters had long been confirmed as victims of a serial killer.<ref name=LAWeekly0/>\n\nIn early September 2008, Los Angeles officials announced that they were offering a $500,000 reward to help catch the killer.<ref name=sky/> On November 1, the case was featured on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] program ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amw.com/fugitives/brief.cfm?id=60381/ |title=Most Wanted fugitives website (defunct) |date= |work=[[America's Most Wanted]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022040939/http://www.amw.com/ |archivedate=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}}</ref> On February 25, 2009, Bratton addressed the press for the first time regarding the case, at which time the police formally gave the killer the \"Grim Sleeper\" nickname chosen by ''LA Weekly''. Bratton also released a [[9-1-1]] call from the 1980s in which a man reported seeing a body being dumped by Franklin, giving a detailed description and license plate number of a van connected with the now-closed Cosmopolitan Church.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pelisek |first=Christine |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/1tape-may-hold-clue-to-identif/ |title=Tape May Hold Clue to Identifying Grim Sleeper Serial Killer \u2013 Los Angeles News \u2013 The Informer |publisher=Blogs.laweekly.com |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2010-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803080447/http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/1tape-may-hold-clue-to-identif/ |archive-date=2009-08-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn March 2009, Pelisek conducted an extensive interview with Enietra Washington, the sole survivor of Franklin's attacks.<ref>{{cite web |author=Christine Pelisek |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-08-28/news/grim-sleeper/4 |title=Grim Sleeper Returns: He's Murdering Angelenos, as Cops Hunt his DNA|work=LA Weekly |date=2008-08-28 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}</ref><ref name=LAWeekly1>{{cite web |author=Christine Pelisek |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-03-12/news/grim-sleeper-39-s-sole-survivor/2 |title=Grim Sleeper's Sole Survivor|work=LA Weekly |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}</ref> Washington described him as \"a black man in his early 30s [\u2060\u200a\u2060.\u2060\u200a\u2060.\u2060\u200a\u2060.\u2060\u200a\u2060] He looked neat.

Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley identified the suspect as 57-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr., a mechanic who worked between 1981 and 1988 for the City of Los Angeles in the sanitation department and briefly for the LAPD.<ref name=msn/> Franklin was identified for arrest, at least in part, on [[DNA profiling#DNA evidence as evidence in criminal trials|familial DNA analysis]].<ref name=latimesblog>{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/07/lapd-make-arrest-in-grim-sleeper-serial-killings.html |title=LAPD make arrest in Grim Sleeper serial killings |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date= 2010-07-07|accessdate=2010-07-08}}</ref>\n\nPolice had found no exact match between DNA found at the crime scenes and any of the profiles in California's DNA profile database, so they searched the database for stored profiles that demonstrated sufficient similarity to allow police to infer a familial relationship. They found similar DNA belonging to Franklin's son, Christopher, who had been convicted of a [[felony]] weapons charge. According to Cooley, detectives then used a piece of discarded pizza with Franklin's DNA to make the link.<ref name=yahoonews1/>\n\nOne undercover police officer pretended to be a waiter at a restaurant where Franklin ate, collecting dishes, silverware, glasses, and pizza crusts to obtain DNA.<ref name=yahoonews1/> The identification was used to arrest Franklin after his DNA was obtained and deemed a match.<ref name=CNN1/> Saliva found on the victims established a DNA match linking Franklin to the deaths.<ref name=abcnews1/>\n\nLaw enforcement missed an opportunity to catch Franklin because his DNA was not previously collected. In 2003, Franklin was convicted of a felony and was serving three years of supervised [[probation]]. In 2004, voters passed [[California Proposition 69 (2004)|Proposition 69]], which requires that DNA must be collected from all felons and everyone arrested on some specified charges. It also requires the expansion of the DNA database. Authorities collected and sorted through thousands of DNA samples. While he was on probation, Franklin's DNA was supposed to be entered in the system but was not as probation officers did not collect samples from people who were on unsupervised probation between November 2004 and August 2005. The probation department did not have the resources to collect samples until August 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/15/local/la-me-grim-sleeper-dna-20100715|title=Authorities Missed A Chance to Catch Grim Sleeper Suspect|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-07-15|accessdate=2010-07-23|first=Jack|last=Leonard}}</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 2010, the LAPD released 180 photos of women, found in Franklin's home after unsuccessful attempts to identify the individuals, possibly additional victims. \"These people are not suspects, we don't even know if they are victims, but we do know this: Lonnie Franklin's reign of terror in the city of Los Angeles, which spanned well over two decades, culminating with almost a dozen murder victims, certainly needs to be investigated further,\" said Police Chief [[Charlie Beck]].<ref name=reuters1/>\n\nIn all, investigators found over 1,000 photos and several hundred hours of video in his home.<ref name=reuters1>{{cite news |last=Whitcomb |first=Dan |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BF6EU20101216 |title=L.A. police release photos of possible Grim Sleeper victims |publisher=Reuters |date= 2010-12-16|accessdate=2010-12-18}}</ref> The images show mainly black women of a wide age range, from teenagers to middle-aged and older, often nude.

Of the remaining four victims, two bodies were discovered in the 1980s and two were reported missing in 2005 but the remains of the other two were never found, police said.
