Over the ensuing centuries of Polynesian expansion and settlement, [[M\u0101ori culture]] developed from its Polynesian roots. M\u0101ori established separate tribes, built fortified villages ([[P\u0101]]), hunted and fished, traded commodities, developed agriculture, arts and weaponry, and kept a detailed oral history. Regular European contact began from 1800, and [[United Kingdom|British]] immigration proceeded rapidly, especially from 1855. Colonists had a dramatic effect on the M\u0101ori, bringing [[Christianity in New Zealand|Christianity]], advanced technology, the [[New Zealand English|English language]], numeracy and literacy. In 1840 M\u0101ori chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], intended to enable the tribes to live peacefully with the colonists. However, after several incidents, the [[New Zealand wars]] broke out from 1845, with M\u0101ori suffering a loss of land, partly through confiscation, but mainly through widespread and extensive land sales. M\u0101ori retained their identity, mostly choosing to live separately from settlers and continuing to speak and write ''[[M\u0101ori language|te reo M\u0101ori]]''. With mass migration from Britain, a high M\u0101ori death rate and low life expectancy for M\u0101ori women, the indigenous population figure dropped between 1850 and 1930, becoming a minority.\n\n[[European New Zealanders]] ([[P\u0101keh\u0101]]), despite their location far from Europe, retained strong cultural ties to \"Mother England\".<ref name=\"PASTTENSE\">{{cite news|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3609/features/13619/past_tense.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808093214/http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3609/features/13619/past_tense.html |archivedate=8 August 2009 |title=Past tense |last=Laugesen |first=Ruth |date=11\u201317 July 2009 |work=[[New Zealand Listener]] |volume=219 |issue=3609|accessdate=7 April 2013}}</ref> These ties were weakened by the demise of the British Empire and loss of special access to British meat and dairy markets. P\u0101keh\u0101 began to forge a separate identity influenced by their pioneering history, a rural lifestyle and New Zealand's unique environment. P\u0101keh\u0101 culture became prevalent after the wars, but after sustained political efforts, biculturalism and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] became part of the school curriculum in the late 20th century, to promote understanding between M\u0101ori and P\u0101keh\u0101.\n\nMore recently, New Zealand culture has been broadened by globalisation and immigration from the [[Pacific Islands]], [[East Asia]] and [[South Asia]].

However M\u0101ori sold most of their land after 1870 and continued to do so until the 1980s. From 1820 M\u0101ori entered a long period of cultural and numerical decline.

Settler groups from many cultures added to the make-up of the country, with many groups concentrated around specific geographic areas. These include [[Dalmatia]]n settlers in [[Northland Region|Northland]], [[Denmark|Danish]] settlers in inland [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]], and [[Cantonese people|Southern Chinese]] and [[Levant]]ine settlers in [[Otago]]. These added to larger-scale P\u0101keh\u0101 settlement which itself varied between English settlers (e.g., in [[Canterbury]]), Irish settlers (e.g., on the South Island [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]]), and Scottish settlers (e.g., in [[Otago]] and [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]]).\n\nFrom the mid twentieth century on, waves of immigrants have entered the country from different ethnic backgrounds, notable Dutch and central Europeans during the 1950s, Pacific Islanders since the 1960s, and northern Chinese, Indians, and southeast Asians since the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of immigration|publisher=Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/history-of-immigration|accessdate=22 August 2017|date=8 February 2005}}</ref> Various aspects of each culture have added to New Zealand culture; [[Chinese New Year]] is celebrated for example, especially in Auckland and Dunedin,<ref>{{cite web|title=Auckland celebrates Chinese New Year|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2016/02/auckland-celebrates-chinese-new-year.html|website=www.newshub.co.nz|publisher=Newshub|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref> and [[South Auckland]] has strong Samoan cultural links.

The annual [[Pacific Music Awards]] recognise the contribution to New Zealand music made by Pacific Island musicians and musical styles. Pacific island heritage is also celebrated in much of New Zealand's fine art, with notable artists such as [[Fatu Feu'u]], [[Lily Laita]], [[John Pule]], [[Yuki Kihara]], and [[Michel Tuffery]] all heavily influenced by their Pacific origins.\n\n==Cultural borrowing and adaptation==\n\n===M\u0101ori borrowing from P\u0101keh\u0101 culture===\nSince the arrival of Europeans, M\u0101ori have been receptive adopters of most aspects of P\u0101keh\u0101 culture. From the 1830s many M\u0101ori nominally converted to [[Christianity]] and in the process learned to read and write, by the late nineteenth century New Zealand when formal schooling finished for most at 12, M\u0101ori were as likely to be literate as P\u0101keh\u0101. A number of religions, such as [[Pai M\u0101rire]] and [[Ringat\u016b]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Pai M\u0101rire - Pai Marire |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/pai-marire/pai-marire-intro |website=nzhistory.govt.nz |publisher=[[NZ History online]]|accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref> arose in the nineteenth century, blending M\u0101ori tradition and Christianity.\n\nSimilarly M\u0101ori traditional chants were put to Victorian music, or written to European tunes, European designs and metal tools adopted by carvers, altering their style and British fabrics and cloth, such as blanketing adopted to form new dress. The horse was adopted, particularly on the East coast. European tools and particularly weapons were frequently decorated with traditional motifs, for example wooden musket and rifle stocks acquired elaborate carving. From the 1820s M\u0101ori began building vessels in the European boat building tradition. Many of these activities were conducted in collaboration with P\u0101keh\u0101 traders and settlers.\n\nAfter the defeat of rebel M\u0101ori who attempted to establish a renegade state in the King Country, the adoption of P\u0101keh\u0101 culture became less of a free choice as P\u0101keh\u0101 began to outnumber M\u0101ori. Parliament passed legislation affecting M\u0101ori, such as the [[Native Schools]] Act (1867) which required English to be the dominant medium of instruction for M\u0101ori children although this was weakly enforced.<ref>{{cite web |title=Part 3: Historical and current context for M\u0101ori education |url=https://www.oag.govt.nz/2012/education-for-maori/part3.htm |website=Office of the Auditor-General New Zealand |accessdate=29 January 2020 |date=2012 |language=en}}</ref> The majority of M\u0101ori encouraged their children to learn the English language and P\u0101keh\u0101 ways of life to function economically and socially. From the 1880s a small number of western educated graduates emerged from M\u0101ori colleges such as Te Aute. Men such as Pomare, Ngata and Buck believed that further adopting Pakeha culture would advance M\u0101ori in New Zealand. Together they formed the [[Young M\u0101ori Party]] which was very influential in starting improved health and education for M\u0101ori. All believed to some extent in redeveloping an interest in M\u0101ori arts and craft.<ref>{{cite web |title=Maori and Pakeha relations 1900-1945 - NZ Race Relations |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/classroom/nz-race-relations/1912-1945 |website=nzhistory.govt.nz |publisher=NZ History online |accessdate=29 January 2020}}</ref> Ngata went on to become a leading New Zealand politician and acting Prime Minister.

These include opera singers [[Inia Te Wiata]] and [[Kiri Te Kanawa]], novelists [[Keri Hulme]] (winner of the [[Booker Prize]]) and [[Alan Duff]], poet [[Hone Tuwhare]] and painter [[Ralph Hotere]], actors [[Temuera Morrison]] and [[Cliff Curtis]] and director [[Lee Tamahori]]. M\u0101ori culture has also provided inspiration to P\u0101keh\u0101 artists.\n\n===P\u0101keh\u0101 borrowing from M\u0101ori culture===\n[[Image:All Blacks Haka.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A multi-ethnic [[All Black]] squad perform a [[haka]].]]\nSince the late nineteenth century, P\u0101keh\u0101 have used M\u0101ori cultural practices when they required something distinctive. The most famous example of this is the [[haka of the All Blacks]], a M\u0101ori posture dance which is performed before international rugby matches (there are many non-M\u0101ori [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] All Blacks, thus making this a multi-ethnic borrowing). However P\u0101keh\u0101 artists such as [[Colin McCahon]] and [[Gordon Walters]] have also incorporated M\u0101ori motifs into their art, and a number of early P\u0101keh\u0101 writers used M\u0101ori themes and topics in an effort to create an authentically New Zealand literature.{{sfn|Jones|1998|pp=123\u20134}} The tourist industry has also made heavy use of M\u0101ori culture in an effort to present tourists with distinctly New Zealand experiences and items. Many P\u0101keh\u0101 in other countries use an aspect of M\u0101ori culture to express their New Zealandness. An example of this is the mass [[haka]] which takes place in [[Parliament Square]] in [[London]] every [[Waitangi Day]]. Although M\u0101ori are generally involved, most participants are P\u0101keh\u0101 (See [[Hei-tiki]].)\n\nFor many years P\u0101keh\u0101 did not consult M\u0101ori over the use of their culture, and M\u0101ori generally did not protest loudly unless a symbol was being used in a particularly inappropriate way. From the 1970s, M\u0101ori increasingly began to object to P\u0101keh\u0101 use of their culture, especially when this use was disrespectful. One example of this is the \"haka party attack\" of 1979. [[University of Auckland]] engineering students had a tradition of performing a mock haka at graduation. After pleas from M\u0101ori students to discontinue the practice were ignored, a group assaulted the engineering students. They were later charged with assault but defended by M\u0101ori elders who testified that the engineers' haka was deeply offensive.<ref>Walker, Ranginui (1990), ''Ka Whawhai Tonu Matou: Struggle Without End'', pp.221\u20135</ref> Most P\u0101keh\u0101 are now more respectful of M\u0101ori culture and often consult M\u0101ori before using M\u0101ori cultural forms. However, despite some [[M\u0101ori people#Business and intellectual property|attempts to copyright cultural intellectual property]] this does not always occur and forms are still sometimes used in inappropriate ways.\n\nSome P\u0101keh\u0101 have been deeply involved in the revival of otherwise lost M\u0101ori arts. In the performance of traditional M\u0101ori musical instruments [[Richard Nunns]] has earned wide respect, as have the contributions made by many academics, for example, Dame [[Anne Salmond]] in the area of traditional rituals of encounter, or [[Mervyn McLean]] in the analysis of traditional song. M\u0101ori history has mainly been written by Pakeha authors such as Michael King, James Belich and Paul Moon. Traditionally M\u0101ori were reluctant to reveal their tribal knowledge to Europeans for fear of being mocked or considered barbaric, and also a belief in keeping tribal secrets. When [[M\u0101ori King Movement|Kingitanga]] allowed Michael King to write the biography of \"Princess\" Te Puea, because of his sensitivity to M\u0101ori, they still withheld material that would not show her in a good light.\n\n===Borrowing from overseas===\nBoth M\u0101ori and P\u0101keh\u0101 have borrowed cultural forms and styles from other countries, particularly [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]]. Most popular [[Music of New Zealand|New Zealand music]] derives from Anglo-American styles, particularly [[rock music]], [[hip-hop]], [[electronic dance music]] and related subgenres. Although there is evidence of a \"New Zealand style\", many groups incorporate New Zealand themes into their work, so this style affects each ''genre'' differently. Since the 2000s, Dubstep, Drum and Bass, Jungle Trance and related subgenres, derived from England, has been further developed by New Zealanders into a unique sound, exemplified by [[Salmonella Dub]], [[Shapeshifter (band)|Shapeshifter]] and many others.\n\nThe visual arts have also shown the influence of international movements, for example [[cubism]] in the early work of [[Colin McCahon]]. In general, the development of international mass media and mass communication has meant New Zealanders have always been aware of developments in other countries; this lends itself to the adoption of new forms and styles from overseas.\n\n==Languages==\n{{Main|Languages of New Zealand}}\nNew Zealand has three official languages. [[English language|English]] is the primary official language with its use unrestricted anywhere. The [[Te Reo M\u0101ori|Maori language]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]] also have official status, in certain contexts, as defined by their respective statutes.<ref name=\"TEARALANG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/government-and-nation/9|title=Government and nation \u2013 Official languages|date=3 March 2009|work=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref>  Other languages are also spoken in New Zealand by some immigrant communities.\n\n===New Zealand English===\n[[New Zealand English]] is close to [[Australian English]] in pronunciation, but has several differences often overlooked by people from outside these countries. The most prominent differences between the New Zealand English dialect and other English dialects are the shifts in the short front vowels: the short-\"i\" sound (as in \"kit\") has centralised towards the [[schwa]] sound (the \"a\" in \"comma\" and \"about\"); the short-\"e\" sound (as in \"dress\") has moved towards the short-\"i\" sound; and the short-\"a\" sound (as in \"trap\") has moved to the short-\"e\" sound.<ref>* {{citation|last=Bauer|first=Laurie|last2=Warren|first2=Paul|last3=Bardsley|first3=Dianne|last4=Kennedy|first4=Marianna|last5=Major|first5=George|title=New Zealand English|journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association|year=2007|volume=37|issue=1|pages=97\u2013102|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282778721_ILLUSTRATIONS_OF_THE_IPA_New_Zealand_English|doi=10.1017/S0025100306002830}}</ref> Some of these differences show New Zealand English to have more affinity with the English of southern England than Australian English does. Several of the differences also show the influence of M\u0101ori speech. The New Zealand accent also has some Scottish and Irish influences from the large number of settlers from those places during the 19th century. At the time of the 2013 census, English was spoken by 96.1% of the total population.<ref name=\"census2013\">{{cite web|title=2013 Census QuickStats about culture and identity \u2013 Languages spoken|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/languages.aspx|website=stats.govt.nz|publisher=Statistics New Zealand|accessdate=8 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Te Reo M\u0101ori===\nAn Eastern Polynesian language, [[Te Reo M\u0101ori]], is closely related to Tahitian and Cook Islands M\u0101ori; slightly less closely to Hawaiian and Marquesan; and more distantly to the languages of Western Polynesia, including Samoan, Niuean and Tongan. The language went into decline in terms of use following European colonisation, but since the 1970s mildly successful efforts have been made to reverse this trend. These include the granting of official language status through the [[M\u0101ori Language Act]] 1987,<ref name=\"TEARALANG\"/> a [[M\u0101ori Language Week|M\u0101ori language week]] and a [[M\u0101ori Television]] channel. The 2013 census found that M\u0101ori was spoken by 3.7% of the population.<ref name=\"census2013\" />\n\nHistorically, there were distinct dialects of Te Reo, most notably a [[Southern M\u0101ori language|softer version]] associated with the southern extreme of the country, though these have been almost completely subsumed by a standardised dialect originally found around the [[Waikato]] area.\n\n===New Zealand Sign Language===\n[[New Zealand Sign Language]] has its roots in British Sign Language (BSL), and may be technically considered a dialect of British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language (BANZSL). There are 62.5% similarities found in British Sign Language and NZSL, compared with 33% of NZSL signs found in American Sign Language. Like other natural sign languages, it was devised by and for Deaf people, with no linguistic connection to a spoken or written language, and it is fully capable of expressing anything a fluent signer wants to say. It uses more lip-patterns in conjunction with hand and facial movement to cue signs than BSL, reflecting New Zealand's history of oralist education of deaf people. Its vocabulary includes M\u0101ori concepts such as marae and tangi, and signs for New Zealand placenames. New Zealand Sign Language became an official language of New Zealand in April 2006.<ref name=\"TEARALANG\"/> About 20,000 people use New Zealand Sign Language.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) Studies|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/study/programmes-courses/subjects/deaf-studies|publisher=Victoria University of Wellington|accessdate=9 September 2016|date=25 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Other languages===\nAccording to the 2013 census, 174 languages are used in New Zealand (including sign languages). As recorded in the 2013 census, [[Samoan language|Samoan]] is the most widely spoken non-official language (2.2%), followed by [[Hindi]] (1.7%), \"Northern Chinese\" (including [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], 1.3%) and [[French language|French]] (1.2%).<ref name=\"census2013\" />\n\n==Arts==\n{{see also|Museums in New Zealand}}\n[[File:Modern wharenui in Te Papa Tongarewa.jpg|thumb|right|A modern [[wharenui]] (meeting house of a [[marae]]) exhibited at the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]]]]\nNew Zealand has two '[[high culture|high cultural]]' traditions: M\u0101ori and Western. However most cultural material consumed in New Zealand is imported from overseas, particularly from Britain and the United States. Because of this and New Zealand's small population, most New Zealand artists, performers and writers struggle to make a living from their art.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}<!-- and artists in the US are all well off? Needs a cite for the particular claim that living in NZ is the issue --> Some funding for the arts is provided through a specific arts based government department, [[Creative New Zealand]]. [[Heritage New Zealand]] and the [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] are national bodies that assist with heritage preservation. Most towns and cities have museums and often art galleries, and the national museum and art gallery is [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Te Papa]] ('Our Place'), in [[Wellington]].\n\n===Visual arts===\n{{Main|New Zealand art}}\n[[File:Gable figure (tekoteko), New Zealand, North Island, Maori people, Te Arawa people, Ngati Tarawhai style, 20th century, wood - De Young Museum - DSC01178.JPG|left|thumbnail|A M\u0101ori [[tekoteko]] (carved human form) originating from [[Te Arawa]]]]\nPre-Colonial M\u0101ori visual art had two main forms: carving and weaving. Both recorded stories and legends and also had religious roles.\n\nWhen Settlers arrived, they brought with them Western artistic traditions. Early P\u0101keh\u0101 art focussed mainly on landscape painting, although some of the best known P\u0101keh\u0101 artists of the nineteenth century ([[C. F. Goldie|Charles Goldie]] and [[Gottfried Lindauer]]) specialised in M\u0101ori portraiture. Some M\u0101ori adopted Western styles and a number of nineteenth century meeting houses feature walls painted with portraits and plant designs. From the early twentieth century [[\u0100pirana Ngata]] and others began a programme of reviving traditional M\u0101ori arts, and many new meeting houses were built with traditional carving and [[tukutuku]] woven wall panels were built. A longstanding concern of P\u0101keh\u0101 artists has been the creation of a distinctly New Zealand artistic style. [[Rita Angus]] and others used the landscape to try and achieve this while painters such as [[Gordon Walters]] used M\u0101ori motifs. A number of M\u0101ori artists, including [[Paratene Matchitt]] and [[Shane Cotton]] have combined Western modernism with traditional M\u0101ori art.\n\n===Performing arts===\n\n====Kapa haka====\n[[File:Young Maori man dancing.jpg|thumbnail|A [[kapa haka]] performer]]\n[[Kapa haka]], (kapa meaning 'rank' or 'row' and haka referring to a M\u0101ori dance), is the 'cultural dance' component of traditional M\u0101ori Performing Arts. Kapa haka is an avenue for M\u0101ori people to express their heritage and cultural identity through song and dance. It has undergone a renaissance, with national competitions held yearly and kapa haka used in many state occasions. The [[haka]] (often mistaken as ''always'' being a war dance or ritual challenge) has become part of wider New Zealand culture, being performed by the [[All Blacks]] as a group ritual before international games and by homesick New Zealanders of all races who want to express their New Zealandness.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the All Black haka|url=http://media.newzealand.com/en/story-ideas/history-of-the-all-black-haka/|website=Tourism New Zealand Media|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Drama====\nNew Zealand drama, both on stage and screen, has been plagued during much of its history by cost and lack of popular interest in New Zealand culture. Despite this [[Roger Hall (playwright)|Roger Hall]] and, more recently, [[Jacob Rajan]] are two playwrights to achieve considerable popular success. In recent decades [[Cinema of New Zealand|New Zealand film]] has grown dramatically, with the films ''[[Once Were Warriors (film)|Once Were Warriors]]'', ''[[The Piano]]'' and ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' doing well both locally and internationally, and [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]] director [[Peter Jackson]] becoming one of film's most successful directors.

In the 1970s and 1980s [[Billy T James]] satirized race relations, and [[David McPhail|McPhail]] & [[Jon Gadsby|Gadsby]] lampooned political figures, especially [[Robert Muldoon]]. [[John Clarke (satirist)|John Clarke]] aka [[Fred Dagg]] joked about rural life. From the 1990s onwards the [[Naked Samoans]] expressed a Polynesian sense of humour to the nation, and [[Raybon Kan]] is a prominent Asian comic and columnist. The [[Topp Twins]] are an off-beat comic/country music duo, and [[Flight of the Conchords]] have become famous throughout the English-speaking world for their self-effacing show.\n\n==Literature==\n{{Main|New Zealand literature}}\n[[File:Margaret Mahy at the Kaiapoi Club, 27 July 2011, smiling (digitally altered).jpg|upright|thumb|New Zealand children and young adult's author [[Margaret Mahy]], July 2011.]]\nNew Zealand's most successful early writers were [[expatriates]] such as [[Katherine Mansfield]]. From the 1950s, [[Frank Sargeson]], [[Janet Frame]] and others had (non lucrative) writing careers while still living in New Zealand. Until about the 1980s, the main New Zealand literary form was the short story, but in recent decades novels such as Alan Duff's ''[[Once Were Warriors]]'', [[Elizabeth Knox]]'s ''The Vintner's Luck'' and others have achieved critical and popular success. M\u0101ori culture is traditionally oral rather than literate, but in recent years M\u0101ori novelists such as Duff, [[Witi Ihimaera]] and [[Keri Hulme]] and poets such as [[Hone Tuwhare]] have shown their mastery of literary forms. [[Austin Mitchell]] wrote two \"[[The Half Gallon Quarter Acre Pavlova Paradise|Pavlova Paradise]]\" books about New Zealand. [[Barry Crump]] was a popular author who embodied and expounded the myth of the Kiwi larrikin and multi-skilled labourer. [[Sam Hunt (poet)|Sam Hunt]] and [[Gary McCormick]] are well-known poets. [[James K Baxter]] was an eccentric but admired author. [[Maurice Gee]] is also a household name for his novels about New Zealand life.\n\nNew Zealand cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] became famous during World War II for his political satire. [[Gordon Minhinnick]] and [[Les Gibbard]] were also witty political observers.

One of its major features was [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] (sacred and/or forbidden), which was used to maintain the status of chiefs and [[tohunga]] (priests) and also for purposes such as conserving resources. Some of the earliest European settlers in New Zealand were [[Christianity|Christian]] [[missionaries]], mostly from the [[Church of England]] but also from [[Protestant]] denominations and the [[Catholic Church]]. From the 1830s onwards, large numbers of M\u0101ori converted.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Throughout the nineteenth century a number of movements emerged which blended traditional M\u0101ori beliefs with Christianity. These included [[Pai M\u0101rire]], [[Ringat\u016b]], and in the early twentieth century, [[R\u0101tana]]. They typically centred on a prophet-leader. These churches continue to attract a substantial following; according to the 2013 census, 50,565 people are R\u0101tana believers, and another 16,419 are Ringat\u016b. 1,689 people stated that they followed M\u0101ori religion.<ref name=\"religion1\" /> Many M\u0101ori members of mainstream churches, and those with no particular religion, continue to believe in tapu, particularly where the dead are concerned, although not to the same extent as their ancestors.\n\n[[File:2013 NZ census people affiliated with Christian religions.gif|thumb|Percentages of people reporting affiliation with Christianity at the 2001, 2006 and 2013 censuses; there has been a steady decrease over twelve years.]]\n\nP\u0101keh\u0101 have become steadily less religious over the course of the twentieth century. In the 1920s there was still a reasonably high level of [[sectarianism]] and anti-Catholic prejudice, but this has since died down and the major churches generally co-operate with each other. The churches and religious lobby groups have little political influence where P\u0101keh\u0101 are concerned. The vast majority of religious P\u0101keh\u0101 are Christian, but a small number follow non-Christian religions, particularly [[Buddhism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Scottish ([[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand|Presbyterian]]) English ([[Anglican Church of New Zealand|Anglican]]) division can still be seen in the religious distribution of some cities and suburbs.

Present-day M\u0101ori society is far less hierarchical than it traditionally was, although it is still stratified by P\u0101keh\u0101 standards. A disproportionate number of [[M\u0101ori seats|M\u0101ori MPs]] come from chiefly families, for example.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} However, a number of M\u0101ori not born into the chiefly families have achieved positions of considerable [[mana]] within their communities by virtue of their achievements or learning.\n\n===The 'classless society'===\nUntil about the 1980s it was often claimed that New Zealand was a '[[classless society]]'.<ref>Sinclair, Keith (1969), ''A History of New Zealand'', 2nd edn, p.285.</ref> The evidence for this was the relatively small range of wealth (that is, the wealthiest did not earn hugely more than the poorest earners), lack of deference to authority figures, high levels of class mobility, a high standard of [[working class]] living compared to Britain, progressive labour laws which protected workers and encouraged unionism, [[state housing]], and a [[welfare state]] which was developed in New Zealand before most other countries.\n\nNew Zealanders' [[egalitarianism]] has been criticised as discouraging and denigrating ambition and individual achievement and success. New Zealanders tend to value modesty and distrust those who talk about their own merits. They especially dislike anyone who seems to consider themselves better than others even if the person in question is demonstrably more talented or successful than others. This attitude can manifest itself in the [[tall poppy syndrome]] or [[crab mentality]], which refer to 'cutting down' of those thought to have risen above the general mass of people.{{sfn|Kennedy|2007|p=399}}<ref>[http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/does-nz-still-cut-down-tall-poppies-2013031807#axzz3n5qzWXoJ \"Does NZ still cut down tall poppies?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930002053/http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/does-nz-still-cut-down-tall-poppies-2013031807#axzz3n5qzWXoJ |date=30 September 2015 }}, 18 March 2013, Adrien Taylor, 3news.co.nz</ref>\n\nIt has been argued that in New Zealand ethnicity takes the place of class, with M\u0101ori and other Polynesians earning less, having a lower standard of living and less education, and working in lower status jobs than P\u0101keh\u0101.{{sfn|Macpherson|1977|p=99\u2013112}}\n\nNew Zealand's claims to be a classless society were dealt a fatal blow in the 1980s and 1990s by the economic reforms of the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|fourth Labour government]] and its successor, the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|fourth National government]]. A cultural shift also took place due to the economic and social impact of international capital, commerce and advertising. New Zealanders were exposed to a previously unknown array of consumer goods and franchises. Aided by overseas programming, commercial radio and TV stations enjoyed rapid growth. Local manufacturing suffered from cheap imports, with many jobs lost. These reforms led to a dramatic increase in the gap between the richest and poorest New Zealanders, and an increase in the numbers living in poverty.<ref>Tim Hazledine (1998) ''Taking New Zealand Seriously: The Economics of Decency'' {{ISBN|1-86950-283-3}}</ref> Recent appreciation of real estate values increased the wealth of a generation of landowners while making housing unaffordable for many. Some are concerned that a [[New Zealand property bubble]] may burst, potentially wiping out considerable wealth.\n\n==Travel==\n{{Main|Overseas experience}}\nIt is very common for New Zealanders to travel or live overseas for extended periods of time, often on [[working holiday]]s. These are usually referred to as the 'OE' or 'overseas experience', and are most commonly taken by people in their 20s. The three most common destinations are Australia, Great Britain and Europe, although recently trips to Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan to teach English have become increasingly popular. The east coast of Australia and London both have sizeable [[expatriate]] New Zealand communities.\n\nThe OE to Europe is usually self-funded, and tends to occur a few years after university graduation, when the traveller has saved up enough for airfares and living expenses. The length of the visit can range from a few months to the remainder of the visitor's life; since many New Zealanders have British ancestry or dual citizenship (sometimes as a result of their parents' OE), the restrictions on working in Britain do not apply to a substantial percentage of them.\n\nWorking holidays in Asia are more likely to occur shortly after graduation, and many agencies specifically target graduates for these trips. Because Australia is relatively close to New Zealand and has no restrictions on New Zealanders working there, the New Zealanders working in Australia are more diverse than those in other countries, with a significantly higher proportion of M\u0101ori and working-class people.\n\nSince the signing of the [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]] in 1973, New Zealanders have had the right to live and work in Australia on equal terms with Australian citizens. Until the 1970s New Zealanders had similar rights in relation to Britain. Changes to British immigration law in this period required New Zealanders to obtain visas to work in Britain or live there for extended periods, unless they had recent British ancestry.\n\nNew Zealand has a number of reciprocal working holiday agreements, allowing people in their 20s to live and work overseas, usually for up to a year. Such agreements are in place with: [[Argentina]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[Malta]], [[Mexico]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Singapore]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Uruguay]].<ref>NZ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade website: http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Countries/index.php</ref>\n\n==National stereotypes==\n\n===The Kiwi male===\n{{See also|Southern man|Man alone}}\nThe stereotypical New Zealand male is essentially a pioneer type: he is perceived to be rural, strong, unemotional, democratic, has little time for high culture, good with animals (particularly horses) and machines, and is able to turn his hand to nearly anything. This type of man is often presumed to be a unique product of New Zealand's colonial period but he shares many similarities with the stereotypical American frontiersman and Australian bushman. New Zealand men are supposed to still have many of these qualities, even though most New Zealanders have lived in urban areas since the late nineteenth century. This has not prevented New Zealanders seeing themselves (and being seen) as essentially country people and good at the tasks which country life requires.{{sfn|Phillips|1987|pp=1\u201342}}\n\n:'''The hard man''': New Zealand men have often been stereotyped as strong, unemotional and prone to violence.{{sfn|Phillips|1987|pp=81\u2013130}} For many years this was seen as a good thing, and was best embodied by [[All Black]] [[Colin Meads]]. Voted 'New Zealand player of the century' by ''New Zealand Rugby Monthly'' magazine, Meads was the second All Black to be sent off the field, and once played a match with a broken arm. Although he was known to assault other players during games, this was generally approved of as 'enforcement' of the 'spirit of the game'.<ref>{{All Blacks|601|Colin Meads}}</ref> He was also a supporter of sporting contact with apartheid South Africa. In recent decades the macho attitude has been both criticised and reviled as dangerous both to men who embody it and those around them. It has been blamed for New Zealand's culture of heavy drinking and its high male suicide rate.{{sfn|Phillips|1987|pp=261\u201389}} However it still has its supporters, with some commentators claiming that the more recent All Blacks do not have enough 'mongrel'.<ref name=\"Stuff.co.nz_2585824\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/all-blacks/2585824/All-Blacks-need-more-mongrel |title=All Blacks need more mongrel |author=Long, David |date=12 July 2009 |work= Sunday News | publisher = Fairfax |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Attitudes==\n{{Anchor| Attitudes}}<!--Links from other articles point to this section-->\n===Social conservatism and progressiveness===\nNew Zealand social policy has tended to oscillate between social progressiveness and conservatism.

Having led the (non-communist) world in economic regulation from the 1930s, in the 1980s and 1990s the reforms of the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour Government]] led the world in economic de-regulation.

Key ingredients included [[Sweet potato|k\u016bmara]] (sweet potato), fern root, [[taro]], birds and fish. Food was cooked in [[h\u0101ngi]] (earth ovens) and roasted, and in [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] areas was boiled or steamed using natural hot springs and pools. Various means of preserving birds and other foods were also employed. M\u0101ori were one of the few peoples to have no form of [[alcoholic beverage]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nFollowing the arrival of British settlers, M\u0101ori adopted many of their foods, especially pork and potatoes, the latter of which transformed the M\u0101ori agricultural economy. Many traditional food sources became scarce as introduced predators dramatically reduced bird populations, and forests were cleared for farming and timber. Traditional seafoods such as [[Paphies ventricosa|toheroa]] and [[whitebait]] were over-harvested. Present day M\u0101ori cuisine is a mixture of M\u0101ori tradition, old fashioned English cookery, and contemporary dishes. In everyday life the two foods of M\u0101ori origin are \"the boil up\" (boiled up left over food meat and vegetable scraps sometimes thickened with flour), and the h\u0101ngi which is associated with special occasions.<ref>''Maori hangi: Guide to how to make a Hangi.''</ref>\n\n===P\u0101keh\u0101 cuisine===\n[[File:Pavlova garnished with cream and strawberries.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pavlova (food)|Pavlova]], a popular New Zealand dessert, garnished with cream and strawberries.]]\nSince the majority of P\u0101keh\u0101 are of British descent, P\u0101keh\u0101 cuisine is heavily influenced by [[British cuisine]]. A major difference between British and P\u0101keh\u0101 food was that meat was more readily available to all social classes in New Zealand.

Over the ensuing centuries of Polynesian expansion and settlement, [[M\u0101ori culture]] developed from its Polynesian roots. M\u0101ori established separate tribes, built fortified villages ([[P\u0101]]), hunted and fished, traded commodities, developed agriculture, arts and weaponry, and kept a detailed oral history. Regular European contact began from 1800, and [[United Kingdom|British]] immigration proceeded rapidly, especially from 1855. Colonists had a dramatic effect on the M\u0101ori, bringing [[Christianity in New Zealand|Christianity]], advanced technology, the [[New Zealand English|English language]], numeracy and literacy. In 1840 M\u0101ori chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], intended to enable the tribes to live peacefully with the colonists. However, after several incidents, the [[New Zealand wars]] broke out from 1845, with M\u0101ori suffering a loss of land, partly through confiscation, but mainly through widespread and extensive land sales. M\u0101ori retained their identity, mostly choosing to live separately from settlers and continuing to speak and write ''[[M\u0101ori language|te reo M\u0101ori]]''. With mass migration from Britain, a high M\u0101ori death rate and low life expectancy for M\u0101ori women, the indigenous population figure dropped between 1850 and 1930, becoming a minority.\n\n[[European New Zealanders]] ([[P\u0101keh\u0101]]), despite their location far from Europe, retained strong cultural ties to \"Mother England\".<ref name=\"PASTTENSE\">{{cite news|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3609/features/13619/past_tense.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808093214/http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3609/features/13619/past_tense.html |archivedate=8 August 2009 |title=Past tense |last=Laugesen |first=Ruth |date=11\u201317 July 2009 |work=[[New Zealand Listener]] |volume=219 |issue=3609|accessdate=7 April 2013}}</ref> These ties were weakened by the demise of the British Empire and loss of special access to British meat and dairy markets.

The horse was adopted, particularly on the East coast. European tools and particularly weapons were frequently decorated with traditional motifs, for example wooden musket and rifle stocks acquired elaborate carving. From the 1820s M\u0101ori began building vessels in the European boat building tradition. Many of these activities were conducted in collaboration with P\u0101keh\u0101 traders and settlers.\n\nAfter the defeat of rebel M\u0101ori who attempted to establish a renegade state in the King Country, the adoption of P\u0101keh\u0101 culture became less of a free choice as P\u0101keh\u0101 began to outnumber M\u0101ori.

The most famous example of this is the [[haka of the All Blacks]], a M\u0101ori posture dance which is performed before international rugby matches (there are many non-M\u0101ori [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] All Blacks, thus making this a multi-ethnic borrowing). However P\u0101keh\u0101 artists such as [[Colin McCahon]] and [[Gordon Walters]] have also incorporated M\u0101ori motifs into their art, and a number of early P\u0101keh\u0101 writers used M\u0101ori themes and topics in an effort to create an authentically New Zealand literature.{{sfn|Jones|1998|pp=123\u20134}} The tourist industry has also made heavy use of M\u0101ori culture in an effort to present tourists with distinctly New Zealand experiences and items. Many P\u0101keh\u0101 in other countries use an aspect of M\u0101ori culture to express their New Zealandness. An example of this is the mass [[haka]] which takes place in [[Parliament Square]] in [[London]] every [[Waitangi Day]]. Although M\u0101ori are generally involved, most participants are P\u0101keh\u0101 (See [[Hei-tiki]].)\n\nFor many years P\u0101keh\u0101 did not consult M\u0101ori over the use of their culture, and M\u0101ori generally did not protest loudly unless a symbol was being used in a particularly inappropriate way. From the 1970s, M\u0101ori increasingly began to object to P\u0101keh\u0101 use of their culture, especially when this use was disrespectful. One example of this is the \"haka party attack\" of 1979. [[University of Auckland]] engineering students had a tradition of performing a mock haka at graduation. After pleas from M\u0101ori students to discontinue the practice were ignored, a group assaulted the engineering students. They were later charged with assault but defended by M\u0101ori elders who testified that the engineers' haka was deeply offensive.<ref>Walker, Ranginui (1990), ''Ka Whawhai Tonu Matou: Struggle Without End'', pp.221\u20135</ref> Most P\u0101keh\u0101 are now more respectful of M\u0101ori culture and often consult M\u0101ori before using M\u0101ori cultural forms. However, despite some [[M\u0101ori people#Business and intellectual property|attempts to copyright cultural intellectual property]] this does not always occur and forms are still sometimes used in inappropriate ways.\n\nSome P\u0101keh\u0101 have been deeply involved in the revival of otherwise lost M\u0101ori arts. In the performance of traditional M\u0101ori musical instruments [[Richard Nunns]] has earned wide respect, as have the contributions made by many academics, for example, Dame [[Anne Salmond]] in the area of traditional rituals of encounter, or [[Mervyn McLean]] in the analysis of traditional song. M\u0101ori history has mainly been written by Pakeha authors such as Michael King, James Belich and Paul Moon. Traditionally M\u0101ori were reluctant to reveal their tribal knowledge to Europeans for fear of being mocked or considered barbaric, and also a belief in keeping tribal secrets. When [[M\u0101ori King Movement|Kingitanga]] allowed Michael King to write the biography of \"Princess\" Te Puea, because of his sensitivity to M\u0101ori, they still withheld material that would not show her in a good light.\n\n===Borrowing from overseas===\nBoth M\u0101ori and P\u0101keh\u0101 have borrowed cultural forms and styles from other countries, particularly [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]]. Most popular [[Music of New Zealand|New Zealand music]] derives from Anglo-American styles, particularly [[rock music]], [[hip-hop]], [[electronic dance music]] and related subgenres. Although there is evidence of a \"New Zealand style\", many groups incorporate New Zealand themes into their work, so this style affects each ''genre'' differently. Since the 2000s, Dubstep, Drum and Bass, Jungle Trance and related subgenres, derived from England, has been further developed by New Zealanders into a unique sound, exemplified by [[Salmonella Dub]], [[Shapeshifter (band)|Shapeshifter]] and many others.\n\nThe visual arts have also shown the influence of international movements, for example [[cubism]] in the early work of [[Colin McCahon]]. In general, the development of international mass media and mass communication has meant New Zealanders have always been aware of developments in other countries; this lends itself to the adoption of new forms and styles from overseas.\n\n==Languages==\n{{Main|Languages of New Zealand}}\nNew Zealand has three official languages. [[English language|English]] is the primary official language with its use unrestricted anywhere. The [[Te Reo M\u0101ori|Maori language]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]] also have official status, in certain contexts, as defined by their respective statutes.<ref name=\"TEARALANG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/government-and-nation/9|title=Government and nation \u2013 Official languages|date=3 March 2009|work=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref>  Other languages are also spoken in New Zealand by some immigrant communities.\n\n===New Zealand English===\n[[New Zealand English]] is close to [[Australian English]] in pronunciation, but has several differences often overlooked by people from outside these countries. The most prominent differences between the New Zealand English dialect and other English dialects are the shifts in the short front vowels: the short-\"i\" sound (as in \"kit\") has centralised towards the [[schwa]] sound (the \"a\" in \"comma\" and \"about\"); the short-\"e\" sound (as in \"dress\") has moved towards the short-\"i\" sound; and the short-\"a\" sound (as in \"trap\") has moved to the short-\"e\" sound.<ref>* {{citation|last=Bauer|first=Laurie|last2=Warren|first2=Paul|last3=Bardsley|first3=Dianne|last4=Kennedy|first4=Marianna|last5=Major|first5=George|title=New Zealand English|journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association|year=2007|volume=37|issue=1|pages=97\u2013102|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282778721_ILLUSTRATIONS_OF_THE_IPA_New_Zealand_English|doi=10.1017/S0025100306002830}}</ref> Some of these differences show New Zealand English to have more affinity with the English of southern England than Australian English does. Several of the differences also show the influence of M\u0101ori speech. The New Zealand accent also has some Scottish and Irish influences from the large number of settlers from those places during the 19th century. At the time of the 2013 census, English was spoken by 96.1% of the total population.<ref name=\"census2013\">{{cite web|title=2013 Census QuickStats about culture and identity \u2013 Languages spoken|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/languages.aspx|website=stats.govt.nz|publisher=Statistics New Zealand|accessdate=8 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Te Reo M\u0101ori===\nAn Eastern Polynesian language, [[Te Reo M\u0101ori]], is closely related to Tahitian and Cook Islands M\u0101ori; slightly less closely to Hawaiian and Marquesan; and more distantly to the languages of Western Polynesia, including Samoan, Niuean and Tongan. The language went into decline in terms of use following European colonisation, but since the 1970s mildly successful efforts have been made to reverse this trend. These include the granting of official language status through the [[M\u0101ori Language Act]] 1987,<ref name=\"TEARALANG\"/> a [[M\u0101ori Language Week|M\u0101ori language week]] and a [[M\u0101ori Television]] channel. The 2013 census found that M\u0101ori was spoken by 3.7% of the population.<ref name=\"census2013\" />\n\nHistorically, there were distinct dialects of Te Reo, most notably a [[Southern M\u0101ori language|softer version]] associated with the southern extreme of the country, though these have been almost completely subsumed by a standardised dialect originally found around the [[Waikato]] area.\n\n===New Zealand Sign Language===\n[[New Zealand Sign Language]] has its roots in British Sign Language (BSL), and may be technically considered a dialect of British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language (BANZSL). There are 62.5% similarities found in British Sign Language and NZSL, compared with 33% of NZSL signs found in American Sign Language. Like other natural sign languages, it was devised by and for Deaf people, with no linguistic connection to a spoken or written language, and it is fully capable of expressing anything a fluent signer wants to say. It uses more lip-patterns in conjunction with hand and facial movement to cue signs than BSL, reflecting New Zealand's history of oralist education of deaf people. Its vocabulary includes M\u0101ori concepts such as marae and tangi, and signs for New Zealand placenames. New Zealand Sign Language became an official language of New Zealand in April 2006.<ref name=\"TEARALANG\"/> About 20,000 people use New Zealand Sign Language.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) Studies|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/study/programmes-courses/subjects/deaf-studies|publisher=Victoria University of Wellington|accessdate=9 September 2016|date=25 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Other languages===\nAccording to the 2013 census, 174 languages are used in New Zealand (including sign languages). As recorded in the 2013 census, [[Samoan language|Samoan]] is the most widely spoken non-official language (2.2%), followed by [[Hindi]] (1.7%), \"Northern Chinese\" (including [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], 1.3%) and [[French language|French]] (1.2%).<ref name=\"census2013\" />\n\n==Arts==\n{{see also|Museums in New Zealand}}\n[[File:Modern wharenui in Te Papa Tongarewa.jpg|thumb|right|A modern [[wharenui]] (meeting house of a [[marae]]) exhibited at the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]]]]\nNew Zealand has two '[[high culture|high cultural]]' traditions: M\u0101ori and Western. However most cultural material consumed in New Zealand is imported from overseas, particularly from Britain and the United States. Because of this and New Zealand's small population, most New Zealand artists, performers and writers struggle to make a living from their art.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}<!-- and artists in the US are all well off? Needs a cite for the particular claim that living in NZ is the issue --> Some funding for the arts is provided through a specific arts based government department, [[Creative New Zealand]]. [[Heritage New Zealand]] and the [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] are national bodies that assist with heritage preservation. Most towns and cities have museums and often art galleries, and the national museum and art gallery is [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Te Papa]] ('Our Place'), in [[Wellington]].\n\n===Visual arts===\n{{Main|New Zealand art}}\n[[File:Gable figure (tekoteko), New Zealand, North Island, Maori people, Te Arawa people, Ngati Tarawhai style, 20th century, wood - De Young Museum - DSC01178.JPG|left|thumbnail|A M\u0101ori [[tekoteko]] (carved human form) originating from [[Te Arawa]]]]\nPre-Colonial M\u0101ori visual art had two main forms: carving and weaving. Both recorded stories and legends and also had religious roles.\n\nWhen Settlers arrived, they brought with them Western artistic traditions. Early P\u0101keh\u0101 art focussed mainly on landscape painting, although some of the best known P\u0101keh\u0101 artists of the nineteenth century ([[C. F. Goldie|Charles Goldie]] and [[Gottfried Lindauer]]) specialised in M\u0101ori portraiture. Some M\u0101ori adopted Western styles and a number of nineteenth century meeting houses feature walls painted with portraits and plant designs. From the early twentieth century [[\u0100pirana Ngata]] and others began a programme of reviving traditional M\u0101ori arts, and many new meeting houses were built with traditional carving and [[tukutuku]] woven wall panels were built. A longstanding concern of P\u0101keh\u0101 artists has been the creation of a distinctly New Zealand artistic style. [[Rita Angus]] and others used the landscape to try and achieve this while painters such as [[Gordon Walters]] used M\u0101ori motifs. A number of M\u0101ori artists, including [[Paratene Matchitt]] and [[Shane Cotton]] have combined Western modernism with traditional M\u0101ori art.\n\n===Performing arts===\n\n====Kapa haka====\n[[File:Young Maori man dancing.jpg|thumbnail|A [[kapa haka]] performer]]\n[[Kapa haka]], (kapa meaning 'rank' or 'row' and haka referring to a M\u0101ori dance), is the 'cultural dance' component of traditional M\u0101ori Performing Arts. Kapa haka is an avenue for M\u0101ori people to express their heritage and cultural identity through song and dance. It has undergone a renaissance, with national competitions held yearly and kapa haka used in many state occasions. The [[haka]] (often mistaken as ''always'' being a war dance or ritual challenge) has become part of wider New Zealand culture, being performed by the [[All Blacks]] as a group ritual before international games and by homesick New Zealanders of all races who want to express their New Zealandness.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the All Black haka|url=http://media.newzealand.com/en/story-ideas/history-of-the-all-black-haka/|website=Tourism New Zealand Media|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Drama====\nNew Zealand drama, both on stage and screen, has been plagued during much of its history by cost and lack of popular interest in New Zealand culture. Despite this [[Roger Hall (playwright)|Roger Hall]] and, more recently, [[Jacob Rajan]] are two playwrights to achieve considerable popular success. In recent decades [[Cinema of New Zealand|New Zealand film]] has grown dramatically, with the films ''[[Once Were Warriors (film)|Once Were Warriors]]'', ''[[The Piano]]'' and ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' doing well both locally and internationally, and [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]] director [[Peter Jackson]] becoming one of film's most successful directors. New Zealand's most popular comedian was the late [[Billy T. James]].\n\n====Music====\n{{Main|Music of New Zealand}}\n[[File:Lorde Lollapalooza 2014 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Lorde]] as part of the 2014 [[Lollapalooza]] lineup]]\n\nNew Zealand music has been influenced by [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[country music|country]], [[rock and roll]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]], with many of these genres given a unique New Zealand interpretation.<ref name=\"music\">{{cite web|first=Nancy |last=Swarbrick|title=Creative life \u2013 Music|work=[[Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|date=June 2010|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/creative-life/7|accessdate=21 January 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"canz\">{{cite journal|last=Southgate|first=William|title=Current Developments in New Zealand music|journal=[[Composers Association of New Zealand]] newsletter|date=September 1977|pages=25\u201327}}</ref> Hip-hop is popular and there are small but thriving live music, [[dance party]] and indie music scenes.

In the 1970s and 1980s [[Billy T James]] satirized race relations, and [[David McPhail|McPhail]] & [[Jon Gadsby|Gadsby]] lampooned political figures, especially [[Robert Muldoon]]. [[John Clarke (satirist)|John Clarke]] aka [[Fred Dagg]] joked about rural life. From the 1990s onwards the [[Naked Samoans]] expressed a Polynesian sense of humour to the nation, and [[Raybon Kan]] is a prominent Asian comic and columnist. The [[Topp Twins]] are an off-beat comic/country music duo, and [[Flight of the Conchords]] have become famous throughout the English-speaking world for their self-effacing show.\n\n==Literature==\n{{Main|New Zealand literature}}\n[[File:Margaret Mahy at the Kaiapoi Club, 27 July 2011, smiling (digitally altered).jpg|upright|thumb|New Zealand children and young adult's author [[Margaret Mahy]], July 2011.]]\nNew Zealand's most successful early writers were [[expatriates]] such as [[Katherine Mansfield]]. From the 1950s, [[Frank Sargeson]], [[Janet Frame]] and others had (non lucrative) writing careers while still living in New Zealand. Until about the 1980s, the main New Zealand literary form was the short story, but in recent decades novels such as Alan Duff's ''[[Once Were Warriors]]'', [[Elizabeth Knox]]'s ''The Vintner's Luck'' and others have achieved critical and popular success. M\u0101ori culture is traditionally oral rather than literate, but in recent years M\u0101ori novelists such as Duff, [[Witi Ihimaera]] and [[Keri Hulme]] and poets such as [[Hone Tuwhare]] have shown their mastery of literary forms. [[Austin Mitchell]] wrote two \"[[The Half Gallon Quarter Acre Pavlova Paradise|Pavlova Paradise]]\" books about New Zealand. [[Barry Crump]] was a popular author who embodied and expounded the myth of the Kiwi larrikin and multi-skilled labourer. [[Sam Hunt (poet)|Sam Hunt]] and [[Gary McCormick]] are well-known poets. [[James K Baxter]] was an eccentric but admired author. [[Maurice Gee]] is also a household name for his novels about New Zealand life.\n\nNew Zealand cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] became famous during World War II for his political satire. [[Gordon Minhinnick]] and [[Les Gibbard]] were also witty political observers.

One of its major features was [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] (sacred and/or forbidden), which was used to maintain the status of chiefs and [[tohunga]] (priests) and also for purposes such as conserving resources. Some of the earliest European settlers in New Zealand were [[Christianity|Christian]] [[missionaries]], mostly from the [[Church of England]] but also from [[Protestant]] denominations and the [[Catholic Church]]. From the 1830s onwards, large numbers of M\u0101ori converted.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Throughout the nineteenth century a number of movements emerged which blended traditional M\u0101ori beliefs with Christianity. These included [[Pai M\u0101rire]], [[Ringat\u016b]], and in the early twentieth century, [[R\u0101tana]]. They typically centred on a prophet-leader. These churches continue to attract a substantial following; according to the 2013 census, 50,565 people are R\u0101tana believers, and another 16,419 are Ringat\u016b. 1,689 people stated that they followed M\u0101ori religion.<ref name=\"religion1\" /> Many M\u0101ori members of mainstream churches, and those with no particular religion, continue to believe in tapu, particularly where the dead are concerned, although not to the same extent as their ancestors.\n\n[[File:2013 NZ census people affiliated with Christian religions.gif|thumb|Percentages of people reporting affiliation with Christianity at the 2001, 2006 and 2013 censuses; there has been a steady decrease over twelve years.]]\n\nP\u0101keh\u0101 have become steadily less religious over the course of the twentieth century. In the 1920s there was still a reasonably high level of [[sectarianism]] and anti-Catholic prejudice, but this has since died down and the major churches generally co-operate with each other. The churches and religious lobby groups have little political influence where P\u0101keh\u0101 are concerned.

New Zealanders tend to value modesty and distrust those who talk about their own merits. They especially dislike anyone who seems to consider themselves better than others even if the person in question is demonstrably more talented or successful than others. This attitude can manifest itself in the [[tall poppy syndrome]] or [[crab mentality]], which refer to 'cutting down' of those thought to have risen above the general mass of people.{{sfn|Kennedy|2007|p=399}}<ref>[http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/does-nz-still-cut-down-tall-poppies-2013031807#axzz3n5qzWXoJ \"Does NZ still cut down tall poppies?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930002053/http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/does-nz-still-cut-down-tall-poppies-2013031807#axzz3n5qzWXoJ |date=30 September 2015 }}, 18 March 2013, Adrien Taylor, 3news.co.nz</ref>\n\nIt has been argued that in New Zealand ethnicity takes the place of class, with M\u0101ori and other Polynesians earning less, having a lower standard of living and less education, and working in lower status jobs than P\u0101keh\u0101.{{sfn|Macpherson|1977|p=99\u2013112}}\n\nNew Zealand's claims to be a classless society were dealt a fatal blow in the 1980s and 1990s by the economic reforms of the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|fourth Labour government]] and its successor, the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|fourth National government]]. A cultural shift also took place due to the economic and social impact of international capital, commerce and advertising. New Zealanders were exposed to a previously unknown array of consumer goods and franchises. Aided by overseas programming, commercial radio and TV stations enjoyed rapid growth. Local manufacturing suffered from cheap imports, with many jobs lost. These reforms led to a dramatic increase in the gap between the richest and poorest New Zealanders, and an increase in the numbers living in poverty.<ref>Tim Hazledine (1998) ''Taking New Zealand Seriously: The Economics of Decency'' {{ISBN|1-86950-283-3}}</ref> Recent appreciation of real estate values increased the wealth of a generation of landowners while making housing unaffordable for many. Some are concerned that a [[New Zealand property bubble]] may burst, potentially wiping out considerable wealth.\n\n==Travel==\n{{Main|Overseas experience}}\nIt is very common for New Zealanders to travel or live overseas for extended periods of time, often on [[working holiday]]s. These are usually referred to as the 'OE' or 'overseas experience', and are most commonly taken by people in their 20s. The three most common destinations are Australia, Great Britain and Europe, although recently trips to Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan to teach English have become increasingly popular. The east coast of Australia and London both have sizeable [[expatriate]] New Zealand communities.\n\nThe OE to Europe is usually self-funded, and tends to occur a few years after university graduation, when the traveller has saved up enough for airfares and living expenses. The length of the visit can range from a few months to the remainder of the visitor's life; since many New Zealanders have British ancestry or dual citizenship (sometimes as a result of their parents' OE), the restrictions on working in Britain do not apply to a substantial percentage of them.\n\nWorking holidays in Asia are more likely to occur shortly after graduation, and many agencies specifically target graduates for these trips. Because Australia is relatively close to New Zealand and has no restrictions on New Zealanders working there, the New Zealanders working in Australia are more diverse than those in other countries, with a significantly higher proportion of M\u0101ori and working-class people.\n\nSince the signing of the [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]] in 1973, New Zealanders have had the right to live and work in Australia on equal terms with Australian citizens. Until the 1970s New Zealanders had similar rights in relation to Britain. Changes to British immigration law in this period required New Zealanders to obtain visas to work in Britain or live there for extended periods, unless they had recent British ancestry.\n\nNew Zealand has a number of reciprocal working holiday agreements, allowing people in their 20s to live and work overseas, usually for up to a year. Such agreements are in place with: [[Argentina]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[Malta]], [[Mexico]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Singapore]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Uruguay]].<ref>NZ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade website: http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Countries/index.php</ref>\n\n==National stereotypes==\n\n===The Kiwi male===\n{{See also|Southern man|Man alone}}\nThe stereotypical New Zealand male is essentially a pioneer type: he is perceived to be rural, strong, unemotional, democratic, has little time for high culture, good with animals (particularly horses) and machines, and is able to turn his hand to nearly anything. This type of man is often presumed to be a unique product of New Zealand's colonial period but he shares many similarities with the stereotypical American frontiersman and Australian bushman. New Zealand men are supposed to still have many of these qualities, even though most New Zealanders have lived in urban areas since the late nineteenth century. This has not prevented New Zealanders seeing themselves (and being seen) as essentially country people and good at the tasks which country life requires.{{sfn|Phillips|1987|pp=1\u201342}}\n\n:'''The hard man''': New Zealand men have often been stereotyped as strong, unemotional and prone to violence.{{sfn|Phillips|1987|pp=81\u2013130}} For many years this was seen as a good thing, and was best embodied by [[All Black]] [[Colin Meads]]. Voted 'New Zealand player of the century' by ''New Zealand Rugby Monthly'' magazine, Meads was the second All Black to be sent off the field, and once played a match with a broken arm. Although he was known to assault other players during games, this was generally approved of as 'enforcement' of the 'spirit of the game'.<ref>{{All Blacks|601|Colin Meads}}</ref> He was also a supporter of sporting contact with apartheid South Africa. In recent decades the macho attitude has been both criticised and reviled as dangerous both to men who embody it and those around them. It has been blamed for New Zealand's culture of heavy drinking and its high male suicide rate.{{sfn|Phillips|1987|pp=261\u201389}} However it still has its supporters, with some commentators claiming that the more recent All Blacks do not have enough 'mongrel'.<ref name=\"Stuff.co.nz_2585824\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/all-blacks/2585824/All-Blacks-need-more-mongrel |title=All Blacks need more mongrel |author=Long, David |date=12 July 2009 |work= Sunday News | publisher = Fairfax |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Attitudes==\n{{Anchor| Attitudes}}<!--Links from other articles point to this section-->\n===Social conservatism and progressiveness===\nNew Zealand social policy has tended to oscillate between social progressiveness and conservatism. Social reforms pioneered by New Zealand include [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|women's suffrage]], the [[welfare state]], and respect for indigenous peoples (through the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] and the [[Waitangi Tribunal]]). Having led the (non-communist) world in economic regulation from the 1930s, in the 1980s and 1990s the reforms of the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour Government]] led the world in economic de-regulation.

In recent decades an increasing number of immigrants has changed the demographic spectra. In the larger cities this change has occurred suddenly and dramatically. There has been an increasing awareness of multiculturalism in New Zealand in all areas of society and also in politics. New Zealand's [[race relations]] has been a controversial topic in recent times. The political party [[New Zealand First]] has been associated with an anti immigration policy. The [[New Zealand Human Rights Commission|Office of the Race Relations Conciliator]] was established by the Race Relations Act in 1971<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/t/the-human-rights-act-1993-guidelines-for-government-policy-advisers-june-2000/background#Human%20Rights%20Commission%20and%20Race%20Relations%20Conciliator|title=Background \u2014 Ministry of Justice, New Zealand|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref> for the purposes of \"promoting positive race relations and addressing complaints of discrimination on grounds of race, colour, and ethnic or national origin\", and was merged with the Human Rights Commission in January 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/hrc_new/hrc/cms/files/documents/26-May-2005_21-42-45_Race_relations_summary.doc |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717050548/http://www.hrc.co.nz/hrc_new/hrc/cms/files/documents/26-May-2005_21-42-45_Race_relations_summary.doc |archive-date=17 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Food==\n{{Main|New Zealand cuisine}}\n{{See also|Alcohol in New Zealand}}\n\n===M\u0101ori cuisine===\n[[File:Hangi prepare.jpg|thumb|right|Putting down a h\u0101ngi (earth oven)]]\nM\u0101ori cuisine was historically derived from that of tropical [[Polynesia]], adapted for New Zealand's colder climate. Key ingredients included [[Sweet potato|k\u016bmara]] (sweet potato), fern root, [[taro]], birds and fish. Food was cooked in [[h\u0101ngi]] (earth ovens) and roasted, and in [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] areas was boiled or steamed using natural hot springs and pools. Various means of preserving birds and other foods were also employed. M\u0101ori were one of the few peoples to have no form of [[alcoholic beverage]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nFollowing the arrival of British settlers, M\u0101ori adopted many of their foods, especially pork and potatoes, the latter of which transformed the M\u0101ori agricultural economy. Many traditional food sources became scarce as introduced predators dramatically reduced bird populations, and forests were cleared for farming and timber. Traditional seafoods such as [[Paphies ventricosa|toheroa]] and [[whitebait]] were over-harvested. Present day M\u0101ori cuisine is a mixture of M\u0101ori tradition, old fashioned English cookery, and contemporary dishes. In everyday life the two foods of M\u0101ori origin are \"the boil up\" (boiled up left over food meat and vegetable scraps sometimes thickened with flour), and the h\u0101ngi which is associated with special occasions.<ref>''Maori hangi: Guide to how to make a Hangi.''</ref>\n\n===P\u0101keh\u0101 cuisine===\n[[File:Pavlova garnished with cream and strawberries.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pavlova (food)|Pavlova]], a popular New Zealand dessert, garnished with cream and strawberries.]]\nSince the majority of P\u0101keh\u0101 are of British descent, P\u0101keh\u0101 cuisine is heavily influenced by [[British cuisine]]. A major difference between British and P\u0101keh\u0101 food was that meat was more readily available to all social classes in New Zealand. A highly [[carnivorous]] diet remains a part of P\u0101keh\u0101 culture, although red meat consumption has dropped in the last few decades. [[Meat pies]], [[sausage rolls]], and [[fish and chips]] are popular.  P\u0101keh\u0101 are fond of sweet foods such as biscuits, dessert bars and pavlova.\n\nIn recent decades P\u0101keh\u0101 have discovered 'ethnic' food, and a '[[foodie]]' culture has emerged. New Zealand chefs such as [[Peter Gordon (chef)|Peter Gordon]] played a major part in the creation of [[fusion cuisine]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Other cuisines===\nNew Zealanders increasingly come from many ethnic backgrounds, and most immigrants to New Zealand have tried to reproduce their native cuisines or national dishes in New Zealand. Ethnic restaurants have served as community meeting places and have also given other New Zealanders a chance to try different cuisines.\n\nThe evolution of [[Coffee culture|caf\u00e9 culture]] has been a major part of growth within New Zealand.

With house building, the distinction between Airdrie and Chapelhall is being eroded. Established as a small mining village in the 19th century, it now has population of around 6,560.<ref>{{cite web|title=Estimated population of localities by broad age groups, mid-2012|url=https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/population-estimates/special-area/mid-2012-settlements/2012-pop-est-sett-local-main-tab3a.pdf|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>\nChapelhall is situated just off the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8 motorway]] {{convert|13|mi}} east of [[Glasgow]] city centre and around {{convert|33|mi}} west of [[Edinburgh]].

The rail-freight village links with [[Grangemouth]] docks {{convert|28|mi}} away, ([[England]] to the south and beyond to mainland [[Europe]]).\n\nChapelhall lies on the opposite side of the [[North Calder Water]] from [[Calderbank]] and has very similar history. [[Iron]] working and [[coal mining]] were once prominent - with three [[blast furnace]]s working in the early 1830s. The old village also had a [[quarry]], a [[brickworks]] and a [[bakery]]. The first curator of [[Kew Gardens]], [[William Aiton]], began work as a gardener in Woodhall House near Chapelhall. Two Celtic FC footballers came from the village, Lisbon Lion John Clark and Peter Grant.\n\n== Education ==\nIn December 2001, North Lanarkshire Council published its Schools and Centres 21 (SC21) Programme,<ref name=\"sc21\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.northlanarkshire.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=5310|title=Schools and Centres 21|accessdate=2011-12-24|publisher=North Lanarkshire Council}}</ref> a Public Private Partnership under the broader Education 2010 plan to develop new school facilities throughout the North Lanarkshire area.\n\nIn Chapelhall, the plan proposed a new joint campus for Chapelhall Primary non-denominational and St Aloysius Roman Catholic Primary Schools, which would replace the previous two separate school buildings at Gibb Street (Chapelhall) and on the Main Street (St Aloysius Primary). The initial proposal was based on the prototype Cumbernauld Primary/St Andrew's Primary site, which was endorsed by the [[Archdiocese of Glasgow]], consisting of one public entrance, a shared office, library, gymnasium and dining hall and two adjacent staffrooms with a moveable partition that could be kept open (as both staffs preferred to do).<ref name=\"CumbernauldvPirniehall\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/teaching-resource/Campuses-hit-by-diocesan-divide-389617/|title=Campuses hit by diocesan divide|accessdate=2011-12-24|publisher=Times Education Supplement|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430064152/http://www.tes.co.uk/teaching-resource/Campuses-hit-by-diocesan-divide-389617/#|archive-date=2014-04-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2004, however, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Motherwell|Diocese of Motherwell]] objected to the joint campus proposal, calling for separate entrances, staffrooms, staff toilets, libraries, gymnasia and nurseries, with a shared dining hall.

This could range through integrated digital learning platforms, video lessons, MOOCs, to broadcasting through radios and TVs.\n# '''Ensure inclusion of the distance learning programmes:''' Implement measures to ensure that students including those with disabilities or from low-income backgrounds have access to distance learning programmes, if only a limited number of them have access to digital devices. Consider temporarily decentralising such devices from computer labs to families and support them with internet connectivity.\n# '''Protect data privacy and data security:''' Assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces, as well as when sharing them with other organisations or individuals. Ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students\u2019 data privacy.\n# '''Prioritize solutions to address psychosocial challenges before teaching:''' Mobilize available tools to connect schools, parents, teachers, and students with each other. Create communities to ensure regular human interactions, enable social caring measures, and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated.\n# '''Plan the study schedule of the distance learning programmes:''' Organise discussions with stakeholders to examine the possible duration of school closures and decide whether the distance learning programme should focus on teaching new knowledge or enhance students\u2019 knowledge of prior lessons. Plan the schedule depending on the situation of the affected zones, level of studies, needs of students needs, and availability of parents. Choose the appropriate learning methodologies based on the status of school closures and home-based quarantines. Avoid learning methodologies that require face-to-face communication.\n# '''Provide support to teachers and parents on the use of digital tools:''' Organise brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well, if monitoring and facilitation are needed. Help teachers to prepare the basic settings such as solutions to the use of internet data if they are required to provide live streaming of lessons.\n# '''Blend appropriate approaches and limit the number of applications and platforms:''' Blend tools or media that are available for most students, both for synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learning. Avoid overloading students and parents by asking them to download and test too many applications or platforms.\n# '''Develop distance learning rules and monitor students\u2019 learning process:''' Define the rules with parents and students on distance learning. Design formative questions, tests, or exercises to monitor closely students\u2019 learning process. Try to use tools to support submission of students\u2019 feedback and avoid overloading parents by requesting them to scan and send students\u2019 feedback\n# '''Define the duration of distance learning units based on students\u2019 self-regulation skills:''' Keep a coherent timing according to the level of the students\u2019 self-regulation and metacognitive abilities especially for livestreaming classes. Preferably, the unit for primary school students should not be more than 20 minutes, and no longer than 40 minutes for secondary school students. \n# '''Create communities and enhance connection:''' Create communities of teachers, parents, and school managers to address sense of loneliness or helplessness, facilitate sharing of experience and discussion on coping strategies when facing learning difficulties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/how-plan-distance-learning-solutions-during-temporary-schools-closures|title=How to plan distance learning solutions during temporary schools closures|date=2020-03-06|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Medicine|Education}}\n*[[List of major events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on science and technology]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on religion]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema]]\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = 290 million students out of school due to COVID-19: UNESCO releases first global numbers and mobilizes response\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/news/290-million-students-out-school-due-covid-19-unesco-releases-first-global-numbers-and-mobilizes\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/news/290-million-students-out-school-due-covid-19-unesco-releases-first-global-numbers-and-mobilizes\n| licence = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = COVID-19 Educational Disruption and Response\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures\n| licence = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = How to plan distance learning solutions during temporary schools closures\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/news/how-plan-distance-learning-solutions-during-temporary-schools-closures\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/news/how-plan-distance-learning-solutions-during-temporary-schools-closures\n| licence = \n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Adverse consequences of school closures\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures/consequences\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures/consequences\n| licence = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures UNESCO - COVID-19 Educational Disruption and Response]\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Impact of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic on education}}\n[[Category:2020 in education]]\n[[Category:Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Education]]\n[[Category:Education and health]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Impact of COVID-19 on education}}\n{{Current disaster|event=pandemic|date=March 2020}}\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic sidebar|expanded=issues}}\n{{EngvarB|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:COVID-19_school closures.svg|thumb|450x450px|Learners affected by school closures caused by COVID-19\n{{legend|#e6550d|Country-wide school closures}}\n{{legend|#fdae6b|Localized school closures}}\n{{legend|#1f78b4|No school closures}}\n{{legend|#c0c0c0|No data}}\n]]\nThe [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the widespread closures of schools and universities.\n\nAs of 3 April 2020, over 421 million [[Learning|learners]] were out of school due to school closures in response to COVID-19.

This could range through integrated digital learning platforms, video lessons, MOOCs, to broadcasting through radios and TVs.\n# '''Ensure inclusion of the distance learning programmes:''' Implement measures to ensure that students including those with disabilities or from low-income backgrounds have access to distance learning programmes, if only a limited number of them have access to digital devices. Consider temporarily decentralising such devices from computer labs to families and support them with internet connectivity.\n# '''Protect data privacy and data security:''' Assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces, as well as when sharing them with other organisations or individuals. Ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students\u2019 data privacy.\n# '''Prioritize solutions to address psychosocial challenges before teaching:''' Mobilize available tools to connect schools, parents, teachers, and students with each other. Create communities to ensure regular human interactions, enable social caring measures, and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated.\n# '''Plan the study schedule of the distance learning programmes:''' Organise discussions with stakeholders to examine the possible duration of school closures and decide whether the distance learning programme should focus on teaching new knowledge or enhance students\u2019 knowledge of prior lessons. Plan the schedule depending on the situation of the affected zones, level of studies, needs of students needs, and availability of parents. Choose the appropriate learning methodologies based on the status of school closures and home-based quarantines. Avoid learning methodologies that require face-to-face communication.\n# '''Provide support to teachers and parents on the use of digital tools:''' Organise brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well, if monitoring and facilitation are needed. Help teachers to prepare the basic settings such as solutions to the use of internet data if they are required to provide live streaming of lessons.\n# '''Blend appropriate approaches and limit the number of applications and platforms:''' Blend tools or media that are available for most students, both for synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learning. Avoid overloading students and parents by asking them to download and test too many applications or platforms.\n# '''Develop distance learning rules and monitor students\u2019 learning process:''' Define the rules with parents and students on distance learning. Design formative questions, tests, or exercises to monitor closely students\u2019 learning process.
