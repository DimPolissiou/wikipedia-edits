Although a student at [[Simeon Career Academy]] on the southside, he frequently participated in [[freestyle battle]]s at local parties across town, he made way to gain the approval of hip hop underground audiences, alongside fellow members of his Inner Circle/I.C.U squad.\n\nAs Ewing's reputation grew, more popular crew's sought out to acquire him as a member. In 1997 he joined the group [[ILL Nature]], and merged a union between the groups he had already led, and the new group he was a part of, to create the \"360 Click\", a crew that consisted of Inner Circle, I.C.U., & ILL Nature. They then went on to win several local, as well as [[All City Chess Club|All City]] [[Hip hop|Rap]] Battles, including Ewing winning 2 himself, and placing runner up in his very first attendance against local legend [[Profound]].\n\nAs Ewing started to mature, his focus leaned more in the favor of [[hip hop production]], purchasing his first [[MPC2000XL]] by the age of 18. Fellow [[Chicago]] producer Boogz heard his material and, taken by Ewing's  unique sense of sample selection, began working with him, as well as introducing him to the circle of [[chi-town]] producers Ewing would later become a part of. Including [[No I.D.]], [[Kanye West]], [[Brian \"Allday\" Miller]], & few others. Prolyfic recalls: \"I started working on my craft and getting better and better and there was this cat named Boogz, who I hooked up with at the time. We used to always hang out at the Point over on 55th and Lake Shore \u2013 that was Hip Hop land..... Boogz looked at me as a smaller version of himself.... He saw that I had a good ear for samples, but he knew I needed help on certain things. He showed me how to chop the samples up.... The way Dion \"([[No I.D.]])\" and [[Kanye West|Kanye]] do it. He showed me that style of chopping. He introduced me to people like Icedrake, [[Kanye West]], [[No I.D.]] and Dug Infinite. So Boogz is really the person who is responsible for bringing me into the circle.\"<ref name=\"fakeshoredrive.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fakeshoredrive.com/|title=Fake Shore Drive\u00ae \u2013 The Chicago Hip Hop Music Blog}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 2000, Prolyfic inked his first deal with local [[production company]] \"Infared Music Group\", alongside fellow producer Boogz, and other hip hop acts such as [[Yung Berg]],<ref name=\"fakeshoredrive.com\"/> & [[L.e.p.]].

After a brief stint at Infared, Prolyfic then became an in-house producer for [[Lupe Fiasco]]'s [[1st & 15th]] [[production company]], but left shortly after the release of Fiasco's [[Grammy Award]] Winning debut album, ''[[Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor]]''.\n\nCiting \"[[No I.D.]]\" as his mentor, teacher, & friend,<ref name=\"fakeshoredrive.com\"/> Prolyfic learns by watching and studying under the legendary [[Chicago]] producer's wing.

Although a student at [[Simeon Career Academy]] on the southside, he frequently participated in [[freestyle battle]]s at local parties across town, he made way to gain the approval of hip hop underground audiences, alongside fellow members of his Inner Circle/I.C.U squad.\n\nAs Ewing's reputation grew, more popular crew's sought out to acquire him as a member. In 1997 he joined the group [[ILL Nature]], and merged a union between the groups he had already led, and the new group he was a part of, to create the \"360 Click\", a crew that consisted of Inner Circle, I.C.U., & ILL Nature. They then went on to win several local, as well as [[All City Chess Club|All City]] [[Hip hop|Rap]] Battles, including Ewing winning 2 himself, and placing runner up in his very first attendance against local legend [[Profound]].\n\nAs Ewing started to mature, his focus leaned more in the favor of [[hip hop production]], purchasing his first [[MPC2000XL]] by the age of 18. Fellow [[Chicago]] producer Boogz heard his material and, taken by Ewing's  unique sense of sample selection, began working with him, as well as introducing him to the circle of [[chi-town]] producers Ewing would later become a part of. Including [[No I.D.]], [[Kanye West]], [[Brian \"Allday\" Miller]], & few others. Prolyfic recalls: \"I started working on my craft and getting better and better and there was this cat named Boogz, who I hooked up with at the time. We used to always hang out at the Point over on 55th and Lake Shore \u2013 that was Hip Hop land..... Boogz looked at me as a smaller version of himself.... He saw that I had a good ear for samples, but he knew I needed help on certain things. He showed me how to chop the samples up.... The way Dion \"([[No I.D.]])\" and [[Kanye West|Kanye]] do it. He showed me that style of chopping. He introduced me to people like Icedrake, [[Kanye West]], [[No I.D.]] and Dug Infinite. So Boogz is really the person who is responsible for bringing me into the circle.\"<ref name=\"fakeshoredrive.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fakeshoredrive.com/|title=Fake Shore Drive\u00ae \u2013 The Chicago Hip Hop Music Blog}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 2000, Prolyfic inked his first deal with local [[production company]] \"Infared Music Group\", alongside fellow producer Boogz, and other hip hop acts such as [[Yung Berg]],<ref name=\"fakeshoredrive.com\"/> & [[L.e.p.]]. His first production placement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mvremix.com/urban/reviews/2002/pif.shtml|title=MVRemix Urban Album Reviews: Dream Team - Paid In Full OST &#124; Online Hip Hop, Rap and Soul Magazine &#124; US and Canadian Mainstream and Underground - exclusive interviews, articles|website=www.mvremix.com}}</ref> was on [[Dame Dash]] Presents: Paid In Full/Dream Team Soundtrack<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/4986678/a/paid+in+full.htm&frm=www.cduniverse.com|title=Paid In Full Soundtrack CD Album|website=www.cduniverse.com}}</ref> with Oschino & Sparks on the song entitled \"On and Poppin\". After a brief stint at Infared, Prolyfic then became an in-house producer for [[Lupe Fiasco]]'s [[1st & 15th]] [[production company]], but left shortly after the release of Fiasco's [[Grammy Award]] Winning debut album, ''[[Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor]]''.\n\nCiting \"[[No I.D.]]\" as his mentor, teacher, & friend,<ref name=\"fakeshoredrive.com\"/> Prolyfic learns by watching and studying under the legendary [[Chicago]] producer's wing. He is currently executive producing the release of Detroit-Chicago based recording artist [[Drey Skonie]]'s debut EP entitled \"One Night Stand\" slated to be released March 2014.\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Collegio Ghislieri (Rome)", "text_new": "[[File:Facciata Liceo Virgilio.jpg|thumb|The facade of the Ghislieri College incorporated in the Liceo Virgilio]]\n\nThe '''Collegio Ghislieri''' was a building in Rome, seat of the homonymous charitable institution, important for architectural and historical reasons.\n\nThe College was founded in 1656 by Giuseppe Ghislieri and was deputy to host 24 boys of the decayed [[Papal States|pontifical]] nobility for free during high school. Placed under the protection of the [[duke]] Salviati, the college was closed in 1928.\n\nThe building which hosted the college, possibly work of [[Carlo Maderno]], was demolished in the 1930s. Its fa\u00e7ade on Via Giulia and some decorations have survived, incorporated in the structure of the [[Liceo classico]] Virgilio, built on the same site between 1936 and 1939 after a design by [[Marcello Piacentini]].\n==Location==\nThe building was located in Rome, in the [[Regola]] [[rioni of Rome|Rione]], about halfway down [[via Giulia]] (at the n. 38),<ref name=bor43>Borghi (2015), p. 43</ref> in an area devastated by the demolitions started in 1938 for the construction of a road between [[Ponte Mazzini]] and Corso Vittorio Emanuele, never built because of the war. To the south it bordered with ''vicolo dello struzzo''.<ref name=pie7922/>\n\n==History==\nIn 1656 Giuseppe Ghislieri (1570-1656), a renowned doctor and member of the [[Ghislieri|family]] to which [[Pope Pius V]] (r. 1566-1572) had belonged, on his deathbed destined all his goods to the foundation of this institution.<ref name=bar246>Baronio (1697), p. 246</ref><ref name=pie7922>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 22</ref> In 1670, after being housed in various locations (at the ''Botteghe Oscure'' in front of [[Santo Stanislao dei Polacchi]], in ''Via della Stamperia'' by [[Palazzo Cornaro, Rome|Palazzo Pamphilj]] and at ''Via della Lupa''), the ''Collegio'' moved to its final seat at via Giulia,<ref name=pie7922/> in a 16th century palace possibly designed by [[Carlo Maderno]].<ref name=vir/> The institution was administered by four ''guardiani'' of the [[Archconfraternity]] of the ''[[Sancta Sanctorum]]'' by the [[Scala Sancta|holy stairs]],<ref name=bar247>Baronio (1697), p. 247</ref> and was placed under the protection of the noble Florentine family of the [[Salviati family|Salviati]].<ref name=pie7922/> \n\nWhen the Salviati family died out in 1794, protectors became several [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]], including [[Francesco Carafa della Spina di Traetto]] and  [[Joseph Fesch]], uncle of [[Napoleon]] and resident not far away, at [[Palazzo Falconieri]] in Via Giulia. <ref name=pie7922/> In 1839 the third-born son of the prince [[Borghese]] took the name of the Salviati, thus regaining the protectorate of the college.<ref name=pie7922/> The institution was closed in 1928 because of financial difficulties.<ref name=pie7922/> Through the proceeds of the [[liquidation]], however, annual scholarships were instituted which allowed to continue the college mission.<ref name=pie7922/>\n\nBetween 1936 and 1939 the building was almost completely demolished to make way for the [[Liceo classico]] Virgilio, a controversial work <ref name=pie7924/> by [[Marcello Piacentini]].\n\n==Organization==\nThe boarding school housed for five years 24 young people (later increased to 38)<ref name=bor44/> from fallen noble families of the [[Papal State]].<ref name=pie7922/> Later, the school was opened to young boys of each class.<ref name=bor43/> Of these, who at the time of admission must not have exceeded 18 years of age and for a maximum of five years,<ref name=bar247/><ref name=bor44>Borghi (2015), p. 44</ref> six were hosted free of charge: five of them were designated one each by as many noble families, and the sixth by the Roman people. <ref name=pie7922/> The students attended the subjects of their choice at the [[Collegio Romano]] without any obligation to join the ecclesiastical career,<ref name=bar247/> even though they had to wear a long black dress under their knees and a black [[cassock]], and they had to attend daily mass and often take the sacraments.<ref name=bor45>Borghi (2015), p. 45</ref> The boys were housed in three dormitories, intended for the younger, the older and the middle ones.<ref name=bor44/> The wake up call took place at 5:30 a.m., and after having washed with cold water and followed the lessons at the Collegio Romano, they continued their study in the premises of Via Giulia. <ref name=bor44/> After the recreation they had to study until the evening for three hours and a quarter.<ref name=bor44/> The discipline was very hard, and for every little lack the students were forced to suffer penances and punishments, such the so called ''piatto rovesciato'', that is being at lunch with the overturned dish in silence, therefore fasting.<ref name=bor44/>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Via Giulia Collegio Ghislieri.jpg|thumb|The relief portraying the [[Holy Family]] placed above the entrance portal]]\nThe building, according to some sources, was a 16th century work by [[Carlo Maderno]].<ref name=vir>{{Cite

The team was founded in 1919 by [[Curly Lambeau]] and [[George Whitney Calhoun]], and for the next two years played against local teams in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]]. In 1921, the Packers joined the ''American Professional Football Association'', the precursor to the (NFL) with Curly Lambeau as their coach. After falling into financial trouble, the Green Bay Football Corporation, now known as [[Green Bay Packers, Inc.]], was formed in 1923. The Packers became a publicly owned football team run by a board of directors elected each year. The team went on to win six NFL championships from 1929 to 1944, including three straight (1929&ndash;1931). Along the way, Curly Lambeau, with the help of receiver [[Don Hutson]], revolutionized football through the development and utilization of the forward pass.\n\nAfter Curly Lambeau resigned from the Packers in 1949, the team fell into a slump. They did not have a winning record for 11 straight seasons until 1959, the year that the Packers hired a new coach, [[Vince Lombardi]]. Lombardi would go on to lead one of the most successful teams in league history. Thirteen [[Pro Football Hall of Famers]] played for Lombardi, including quarterback [[Bart Starr]] and linebacker [[Ray Nitschke]]. The Packers lost the 1960 NFL Championship, however they would go on to win five championships in seven years under Lombardi, including three straight between 1965 and 1967. This included the infamous [[1967 NFL Championship Game|Ice Bowl]] and the first two [[Super Bowl]]s. After the passing of Curly Lambeau in 1965, the Packers new stadium (built in 1957 as ''City Stadium'') was named [[Lambeau Field]] in his honor. Five years later, the Packers second great coach, Vince Lombardi, died, just two years after leaving the team for the [[Washington Redskins]].\n\nFrom 1968 to 1992 the Packers only made the playoffs twice. Even with former quarterback Bart Starr as head coach, the Packers were unable to regain their former glory. The team continued to falter until [[Ron Wolf]] took over as general manager. Wolf hired [[Mike Holmgren]] as head coach and traded a first-round draft pick to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] for quarterback [[Brett Favre]]. Favre would go on to lead the Packers to eleven playoffs appearances, two Super Bowl appearances, and one championship in 1996. In 1997, the Packers had their fourth stock sale, expanding the number of shareholders and using the money to fund further expansion of Lambeau Field. In 2005, the Packers drafted quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]]. After Favre left the team in 2007, Rodgers became the starter. {{As of|2017}}, he has led the Packers to eight playoffs appearances and one [[Super Bowl XLV|Super Bowl victory in 2010]]. The Packers had their fifth and most recent stock sale in 2012, again expanding the number of shareholders and using the funding to expand Lambeau Field. With a capacity of 81,441, Lambeau Field is the [[List of American football stadiums by capacity|fifth-largest stadium]] in the NFL. {{As of|2018}}, the Packers hold the record for the most NFL championships (13 total) and the second-most wins in NFL history.\n\n==Founding==\n[[File:Greenbay  packers 1920.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 1920 Green Bay Packers.]]\nThe Green Bay Packers were founded on August 11, 1919, by [[Curly Lambeau]] and [[George Whitney Calhoun]].<ref>[http://www.packers.com/history/birth-of-a-team-and-a-legend.html \"Birth of a Team and a Legend\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218235758/http://www.packers.com/history/birth-of-a-team-and-a-legend.html |date=2014-02-18 }} on Packers website</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Names |first1=Larry D |editor1-first=Greg |editor1-last=Scott |title=The History of the Green Bay Packers: The Lambes the oldest team name still in use in the NFL.}} The Green Bay Packers are the oldest and worst NFL franchise in continuous operation with the same name and the same location.</ref> Lambeau solicited funds for uniforms from his employer, the [[Indian Packing Company]]. He was given $420 for uniforms and equipment.\n\nThe [[1919 Green Bay Packers season]] was their first season of competitive football. The club played against other teams in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]] and ended the season with a 10\u20131 record, losing only to the [[Beloit Fairies]].\n\nThe team became the Acme Packers{{snd}}under the ownership of the Clair brothers{{snd}}and a professional franchise when they joined the newly formed ''American Professional Football Association'' on August 27, 1921. However, the franchise was revoked by the league at the end of the season when the Packers were revealed to have used college players in a game. As it turned out, the man who told the league of this was George Halas of the Chicago Staleys, who changed their name to the Bears the following year. This incident signaled the start of the infamous Packers-Bears rivalry. Lambeau appealed to the league and they allowed the franchise to be reinstated, though Lambeau had to pay the league entry fee of $50 to do so. Further troubles threatened to add more debt to the team, but local businessmen, known as \"[[The Hungry Five]],\" got behind the team and formed the Green Bay Football Corporation in 1923, which continues to run the franchise.\n\n==Public company==\n\nThe Packers are now the only publicly owned company with a [[Green Bay Packers Board of Directors|Board of Directors]] in American professional sports (although other teams, such as the [[Atlanta Braves]] <nowiki>[Liberty Media, previously Time Warner]</nowiki>, [[New York Rangers]] & [[New York Knicks]] <nowiki>[Cablevision]</nowiki>, the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] <nowiki>[Compuware]</nowiki>, and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] <nowiki>[Rogers Communications]</nowiki> are directly owned by publicly traded companies; additionally, three of the nine teams in [[Canada]]'s [[Canadian Football League]] exist with various forms of community ownership [the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] employ a similar ownership structure as the Packers; they have offered shares of the team periodically]). Typically, a team is owned by one person, partnership, or corporate entity; thus, a \"team owner.\" It has been speculated that this is one of the reasons the Green Bay Packers have never been moved from the city of Green Bay, a city of only 104,057 people in the 2010 census.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5531000.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923205832/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5531000.html |archivedate=2006-09-23 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greenbay packers 1921.jpg|thumb|left|220px|A formation of the Packers in 1921.]]\nBy comparison, the typical NFL football team city's population is in either the high hundred-thousands or the millions. The Packers, however, have long had a large following throughout [[Wisconsin]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]; in fact, for decades, the Packers played four (one pre-season, three regular-season) home games each year in [[Milwaukee]], first at the [[Wisconsin State Fair Park|State Fair Park]] fairgrounds, then at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]. The Packers did not move their entire home schedule to Green Bay until 1995.\n\nThe reason for ending the series of Milwaukee games, according to team president Robert Harlan, was the larger capacity of Lambeau Field and the availability of luxury boxes, which were not available at Milwaukee County Stadium.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/sports/pro-football-notebook-can-reich-again-rescue-the-bills.html | work=The New York Times | title=PRO FOOTBALL: NOTEBOOK; Can Reich Again Rescue the Bills? | first=Timothy W. | last=Smith | date=December 18, 1994 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> County Stadium's replacement, [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], then being planned, was always intended to be a [[baseball park|baseball-only stadium]] instead of a multipurpose stadium; County Stadium was closed and demolished in 2001, with Miller Park opening around the same time.\n\nBased on the original \"Articles of Incorporation for the (then) Green Bay Football Corporation\" put into place in 1923, if the Packers franchise was sold, after the payment of all expenses, any remaining monies would go to the Sullivan-Wallen Post of the [[American Legion]] in order to build \"a proper soldier's memorial.\" This stipulation was enacted to ensure the club remained in Green Bay and that there could never be any financial enhancement for the shareholders. At the November 1997 annual meeting, shareholders voted to change the beneficiary from the Sullivan-Wallen Post to the [[Green Bay Packers Foundation]].\n\nIn 1950, the Packers held a stock sale to again raise money to support the team. In 1956, area voters approved the construction of a new stadium, owned by the city. As with its predecessor, the new field was named City Stadium, but after the death of founder Lambeau in 1965, on September 11, 1965, the stadium was renamed [[Lambeau Field]].\n\nAnother stock sale occurred late in 1997 and early in 1998. It added 105,989 new shareholders and raised over $24 million, money used for the Lambeau Field redevelopment project. Priced at $200 per share, fans bought 120,010 shares during the 17-week sale, which ended March 16, 1998. As of June 8, 2005, 111,921 people (representing 4,749,925 shares) can lay claim to a franchise ownership interest. Shares of stock include voting rights, but the redemption price is minimal, no dividends are ever paid, the stock cannot appreciate in value, and stock ownership brings no season ticket privileges.\n\nNo shareholder may own over 200,000 shares, a safeguard to ensure that no individual can assume control of the club. To run the corporation, a board of directors is elected by the stockholders. The board of directors in turn elect a seven-member Executive Committee (officers) of the corporation, consisting of a president, vice president, treasurer, secretary and three members-at-large. The president is the only officer to draw compensation; The balance of the committee is sitting \"gratis.\"\n\nThe team's elected president represents the Packers in NFL owners meetings unless someone else is designated. During his time as coach, [[Vince Lombardi]] generally represented the team at league meetings in his role as general manager, except at owners-only meetings.\n\n==Championships==\nThe Packers have won 13 league championships, more than any other American professional football team (including 4 [[Super Bowl]]s).\nTheir arch-rivals the [[Chicago Bears]] are second, with nine NFL championships (including one Super Bowl). The [[Bears-Packers rivalry|historical rivalry]] with Chicago extends to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] - the Packers have the second most Hall of Famers (21, behind the Bears' 26). The Packers are also the only team to win three straight NFL titles, which they did twice (1929&ndash;1931 and 1965&ndash;67).\n\n==The first Championships (1929-1944)==\nAfter going through modest winning seasons during most of the 1920s, the Packers began to build a championship-caliber team, as they signed three future Hall of Famers in [[John McNally (American football)|\"Johnny Blood\" McNally]], [[Cal Hubbard]], and [[Mike Michalske]]. The Packers won their first NFL Championship in 1929 with a 12-0-1 record, the only undefeated season in Packers history. Their only blemish was a tie with the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]]. The Packers were able to successfully defend their title in 1930, going 10-3-1, and won their third straight league championship in 1931 with a 12\u20132 record.  The Packers nearly won a record fourth straight championship in 1932, going 10-3-1, but finished second behind the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans, who shared the best record in the league.  \n\nAs a side note, in 1928 the Packers also signed (for the third time) [[Frances Louis \u201cJug\u201d Earp]].  Jug played for Green Bay: 1922\u20131924, 1925\u20131927, & 1928\u20131932.)  He also was inducted into the [[Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame]] in 1970.  Jug and [[Wyatt Earp]] were first cousins.\n\nThe Packers scuffled in 1933 and 1934, having their first ever losing season in 1933 with a 5\u20137 record, followed by a mediocre 7-6 the following year. However, Curly Lambeau was able to build another elite team during these seasons, signing more future Hall of Famers like [[Clarke Hinkle]], [[Arnie Herber]], and most notably, receiver [[Don Hutson]] in 1935.\n\nThe Packers became a perennial championship team in the NFL for the next decade, playing in the NFL championship game four times. The Packers went a dominating 10-1-1 in 1936, defeating the [[Boston Redskins]] for the championship 21\u20136, then lost the title game to the New York Giants in 1938, then won the title back over the Giants in 1939, 27\u20130, and one more title, again over the Giants, in 1944, winning 14\u20137. The Packers stayed at the top of the standings thanks to the play of Hutson, Hinkle, Herber, another future Hall of Famer in [[Tony Canadeo]], and other standouts like [[Cecil Isbell]], [[Ted Fritsch]], [[Buckets Goldenberg]], and [[Russ Letlow]].\n\n==1945\u20131958==\nAlthough it was not apparent at the time, the 1944 title season was the start of a long decline for the Packers. Following their 1944 championship, the Packers finished 6\u20134 in 1945 and 6\u20135 in 1946. After the NFL established a uniform 12-game season in 1947, Green Bay won six games, lost five, and had one tie. In 1948, the Packers fell to 3\u20139, only the second losing season in franchise history and their first since 1933. The team bottomed out in 1949 with a record of 2-10, at the time the worst season in franchise history.\n\nIn 1946, Lambeau purchased [[Rockwood Lodge]], a former [[Norbertine]] retreat 17 miles north of Green Bay, and converted it into the first self-contained training facility in pro football history, complete with living and dining facilities for the players and their families. However, the players soon grew to detest the Lodge, primarily because the practice fields sat on top of brick-hard limestone. The players took such a severe beating during practice that Lambeau sometimes had to move practices back to fields near City Stadium. According to a 2013 article in ''[[ESPN The Magazine]],'' the team's rapid on-field decline was tied in part to the unforgiving fields at the Lodge, or \"the Rock\" as the players derisively called it. Additionally, Lambeau refused to abandon the [[Notre Dame Box]], a variation of the [[single-wing formation|single wing]], long after most teams switched to running the [[T formation]].<ref name=BlazeofGlory>{{cite journal |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9669836/mysterious-fire-1950-saved-green-bay-packers-espn-magazine |title=Blaze of Glory |last=Fleming |first=David |magazine=[[ESPN The Magazine]] |date=September 19, 2013 |accessdate=March 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207175756/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9669836/mysterious-fire-1950-saved-green-bay-packers-espn-magazine |archive-date=February 7, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe team's problems were not limited to the on-field product. The Lodge's upkeep, combined with declining revenues from City Stadium, caused severe financial problems. By 1949, they had gotten so severe that Lambeau largely handed the team to his assistants in order to devote his full attention to the team's balance sheet. Even slashing the payroll and his own salary were not enough to staunch the bleeding. The Packers only survived the season by staging an intrasquad scrimmage with retired players on Thanksgiving Day.<ref name=\"TURB\">{{Cite news | title = Rockwood Lodge had turbulent history | last = Hendricks | first = Martin | url = https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2016/08/18/rockwood-lodge-had-turbulent-existence/88904044/ | date = August 18, 2016 | access-date = March 8, 2019 | df = mdy | url-status = live | newspaper = [[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]] | archive-date = August 24, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160824012535/https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2016/08/18/rockwood-lodge-had-turbulent-existence/88904044/}}</ref>\n\nAll of this chilled Lambeau's already deteriorating relationship with the Packers management. After giving him a free hand for most of the last three decades, several team executives revolted at the exorbitant costs of buying and renovating Rockwood Lodge; some members of the financial committee almost resigned. Lambeau also rankled fans by spending most of his offseasons on \"recruiting trips\" far from Wisconsin. He arrived in Green Bay for the 1946 season sporting tailored suits, saddle shoes and a cigarette holder, leading fans to call him \"the Earl of Hollywood.\"<ref name=BlazeofGlory/>\n\nBy the end of the 1949 season, the Packers were on a seemingly irreversible slide toward bankruptcy. Rumors abounded that the league would use the impending merger with the [[All-America Football Conference]] as an excuse to force the Packers to either move or fold. Amid this, Lambeau tracked down four investors who were willing to pump $200,000 into the team\u2013provided that the franchise become privately held once again. This proposal was considered rank heresy in Green Bay. Many fans and executives believed NFL officials were pressuring Lambeau to move the team to the West Coast. In response, team president [[Emil R. Fischer]] tendered Lambeau a two-year contract extension that would have stripped Lambeau of all authority over non-football matters. Lambeau rejected the offer out of hand, effectively ending his tenure at the helm of the franchise that he founded.<ref name=BlazeofGlory/><ref name=\"TURB\"/>\n\nLambeau formally resigned on February 1, 1950,<ref name=clqtctc>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WOMpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZyMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5757%2C11134 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=Curly Lambeau quits to coach the Cardinals |date=February 1, 1950 |page=1, part 1 |access-date=November 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120134159/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WOMpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZyMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5757%2C11134 |archive-date=November 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nE9QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Yg0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7269%2C4720741 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Lambeau quits for Card job; Isbell seeks Packer post |date=February 2, 1950 |page=5, part 2 |access-date=November 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120133319/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nE9QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Yg0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7269%2C4720741 |archive-date=November 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> a little over a week after Rockwood Lodge burned to the ground. Rumors have long abounded that a Packers employee set the fire, though interviews with the family of caretaker Melvin Flagstad and other team officials of the time suggested it was caused by electrical problems. What is beyond dispute is that the $75,000 insurance payout helped pull the team from the financial brink.<ref name=BlazeofGlory/><ref name=\"TURB\"/> \n\nEven with the insurance money, the Packers were still struggling both on and off the field. A bond drive was issued in 1950, which raised $118,000 for the struggling team. [[Gene Ronzani]] replaced Lambeau as coach, and the team began using the green and gold colored uniforms that have been worn ever since. Green Bay won three games that season and in 1951. Ronzani's efforts to rebuild the team were severely hampered by the onset of the [[Korean War]]. However, led by a talented crop of rookies, the Packers got out to a 6\u20133 start in 1952 and were in playoff contention for most of the season. However, they closed they year with a three-game losing streak to end the season. A loss to Detroit in the final game left them in fourth place.<ref name=Guilbrandsen>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PpXQ19EQMzcC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=I+want+it+understood+that+I+am+in+complete+command+Lombardi&source=bl&ots=qUFl8BNpL4&sig=ACfU3U2VebI4nWJHITgeuXjDCk6GEaTXTw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjHz8Tm6-_mAhUEheAKHfs3AAgQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=I%20want%20it%20understood%20that%20I%20am%20in%20complete%20command%20Lombardi&f=false|title=Green Bay Packers: The Complete Illustrated History - Third Edition|author1=Don Guilbrandsen|publisher=[[Voyageur Press]]|date=2011|isbn=1616731486}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the issue of a new stadium began to crop up. City Stadium had long been known to be an extremely inadequate facility. The wooden stadium, adjacent to [[Green Bay East High School|East High School]], seated only 25,000 people and could not be expanded. The Packers had to use East High's locker room facilities, while the visiting team usually dressed at their hotel. Since the 1930s, the Packers had begun playing some home games in [[Milwaukee]]. By the time [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] opened in 1953, the Packers played two or three home games a year in Milwaukee.\n\nThe first game played at MCS was a 27\u20130 shutout at the hands of Cleveland, after which the Packers finished 1953 2-7-1. Ronzani was forced to resign with two games left in the season. [[Verne Llewellyn]] took over as GM in 1954 and [[Lisle Blackbourn]] of [[Marquette University]] was hired as head coach, but the Packers won four games that season. A 6\u20136 record in 1955 again put the team in postseason contention, but a loss to the Bears sent them home. The Packers fell back to 4\u20138 in 1956, a season most noteworthy for the drafting of [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]] QB [[Bart Starr]].\n\nBy then, the question of the Packers' staying in Green Bay was becoming acute. More and more opponents began asking for their games against the Packers to be played at County Stadium, which was almost double the size of City Stadium. League officials gave the Packers an ultimatum\u2013get a new stadium or move to Milwaukee full-time. Buoyed in part by a strong finish to the 1955 season, the people of Green Bay overwhelmingly passed a bond issue for a brand-new 32,000-seat stadium, naming it [[Lambeau Field|New City Stadium]]. The new stadium was dedicated in a game against the Chicago Bears. The Packers won the game, 21\u201317, but finished the season 3\u20139.<ref name=Guilbrandsen/>  \n\nBlackbourn was fired after the season and the coaching job was given to longtime assistant [[Ray McLean|Ray \"Scooter\" McLean]]. By this time, however, the once-proud franchise had become notorious as a dumping ground for players who either underperformed on the field or flouted team rules. Under the circumstances, the 1957 season was an unmitigated disaster. The Packers finished 1\u201310\u20131, the worst record in franchise history. McLean promptly resigned.<ref name=Guilbrandsen/>\n\nAmid growing concern inside and outside of Green Bay about the state of the team, the Packers then made what proved to be the most important hire in the history of the franchise, hiring [[Vince Lombardi]], the offensive coordinator of the dominating [[New York Giants]], as head coach and general manager. Lombardi demanded and got complete authority over football operations. Reinforcing the message, when he arrived in Green Bay, he told the executive committee, \"I want it understood that I am in complete command around here.\" The message applied to the players as well. Lombardi ran his first training camp as a harsh taskmaster, but the players quickly bought in, setting the stage for the decade to come.<ref name=Guilbrandsen/>\n\n==Lombardi era (1959-1967)==\n\nThe Packers of the 1960s were one of the most dominant NFL teams of all time. Coach [[Vince Lombardi]] took over a last-place team in 1959 and built it into a juggernaut, winning five league championships over a seven-year span culminating with victories in the first two [[Super Bowl]]s. During the Lombardi era, the Packers had a group of legendary stars: the offense was led by quarterback [[Bart Starr]], [[Jim Taylor (fullback)|Jim Taylor]], [[Carroll Dale]], [[Paul Hornung]], [[Forrest Gregg]], [[Fuzzy Thurston]] and [[Jerry Kramer]]; the defense was led by the likes of [[Willie Davis (defensive end)|Willie Davis]], [[Henry Jordan]], [[Willie Wood (American football)|Willie Wood]], [[Ray Nitschke]], [[Dave Robinson (American football)|Dave Robinson]], and [[Herb Adderley]].\n\nSeveral other factors helped the Packers return to success. After Pete Rozelle became NFL Commissioner in 1960, he made sure that every franchise got all its games broadcast on television, as up to that point only big-market teams like the Bears and Giants enjoyed this privilege. TV helped raise revenue for small-market teams like Green Bay, and also there was the introduction of [[revenue sharing]], which ensured that no NFL franchise would have to worry about bankruptcy.\n\nThe greatness of the Packers of the '60s really began [[1959 Green Bay Packers season|one year earlier]] with the hiring of Lombardi. In their first game under Lombardi on September 27, 1959, the Packers beat the heavily favored [[1959 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] 9\u20136 at Lambeau Field. The Packers got off to a 3&ndash;0 start before losing the next five, but then won their last four games to achieve their first winning season in 12 years since [[1947 Green Bay Packers season|1947]], ultimately finishing 7\u20135. A 21\u20130 shutout of Washington on November 22 was the last Packers game to date that did not sell out.\n\n[[1960 Green Bay Packers season|The next year in 1960]], the Packers, led by Paul Hornung's 176 points, finished 8-4 and won their first division title since 1944 during the height of World War II.  They also contested the NFL championship game for the first time since that year.  They won the NFL West Title and played in the [[1960 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship]] against the [[1960 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] at [[Franklin Field|Philadelphia]]. In a see-saw game the Packers trailed the Eagles by four points late in the game. The Packers began their final drive, aiming for glory, but it was not to be as [[Chuck Bednarik]] tackled Jim Taylor just nine yards short of the goal line as time ran out. Philadelphia won the championship, 17\u201313. In the locker room after the game, Lombardi told his men that this would be the last time the Packers would lose the championship game with him at the helm. That prediction became fact, as the Packers would never again lose the [[List of NFL champions (1920\u20131969)|NFL Championship Game]] under Lombardi.  This, in fact, would be Vince Lombardi's only postseason loss.\n\nAfter going 11-3 the [[1961 Green Bay Packers season|following season]] in the [[1961 NFL season|NFL's]] newly expanded 14-game schedule, the Packers again won their division and returned to the [[1961 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]], as they faced the [[1961 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], this time at New City Stadium. This time the game was no contest; the Packers exploded for 24 2nd quarter points as Paul Hornung, having recently returned from the [[United States Army|Army]], scored an NFL Championship record 19 points. The Packers shut out the Giants 37\u20130 to win their first championship since [[1944 NFL Championship Game|1944]] and their 7th total.\n\nNot resting on their 1961 Championship, the Packers stormed back in [[1962 Green Bay Packers season|1962]], jumping out to a 10&ndash;0 start en route to an amazing 13&ndash;1 season. This included a rematch with the Eagles in Franklin Field. Green Bay avenged the 1960 championship game by snuffing their opponent 49\u20130 in a game widely referred to as \"Lombardi's Revenge\". It would be the last Packers victory in Philadelphia until 2010. They reached the championship game again, this time in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. The Packers faced the [[1962 New York Giants season|Giants]] in a much more brutal [[1962 NFL Championship Game|championship game]] than the previous year, but the Packers prevailed on the surprising foot of Jerry Kramer and the determined running of Jim Taylor. They ground down the Giants 16&ndash;7 and Titletown U.S.A. reigned supreme.\n\nA three-peat eluded Green Bay in [[1963 Green Bay Packers season|1963]] as RB Paul Hornung was suspended by the league for betting on games. Without him, the team still finished 11-2-1, but was swept by the Bears, who won the division and ultimately the championship. The Packers were then forced into the embarrassing situation of having to go to Miami for the so-called \"Playoff Bowl\", an exhibition game the NFL held every January during 1960-69 between the second-place finishers of each conference. They beat Cleveland 40\u201323, but Vince Lombardi was not happy about it, calling the Playoff Bowl \"The Shit Bowl. A loser's game for losers. Because that's all second place is.\"\n\nThe Packers appeared to have run out of gas in [[1964 Green Bay Packers season|1964]], winning only eight games, losing five, and having one tie. Again they had to contest the meaningless Playoff Bowl in Miami, this time with the Cardinals, who won 24\u201317. Lombardi was again infuriated, calling it \"a rinky-dink game in a rinky-dink town between two rinky-dink teams.\"\n\n===1965 season===\nDuring the 1965 off-season, Curly Lambeau died and the Packers renamed New City Stadium Lambeau Field in his honor.  After a two-year absence from championship football, the [[1965 Green Bay Packers season|Pack]] was back in [[1965 NFL season|1965]]. The Packers rebounded by winning ten games and losing three.  They won some crucial games, including a 42&ndash;27 win over the [[1965 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]], a contest in which Paul Hornung (coming back from a betting scandal and injuries) scored five touchdowns. But, the season ender with San Francisco was a tie, forcing them to play the Colts at home in a playoff for the Western Conference title. A close defensive struggle, the game would be remembered for [[Don Chandler]]'s controversial field goal in which the ball possibly went wide right, but the official raised his arms to grant the three points. The two teams tied at 10-10 and went into overtime, where Green Bay won it on a 25-yard Chandler FG. The disputed win sent the Packers to the NFL Championship Game at home, where Hornung and Taylor ran through the [[1965 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]], helping the Packers defeat the Browns 23\u201312 to earn their 3rd NFL Championship under Lombardi.\n\n===1966 and 1967 seasons and first two Super Bowls===\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 15 - Willie Davis.jpg|right|thumb|The Packers and the Chiefs in the first AFL\u2013NFL Championship game. (Super Bowl I)]]\n[[1966 NFL season|1966]] would prove one of the most important years ever for both the Packers and the NFL as a whole. In 1959, Lamar Hunt and several others, frustrated at the league's lack of interest in expansion, began a rival organization, the American Football League. The AFL was initially laughed at by the NFL, but by 1965 were a serious competitor and began engaging in bidding wars for top college players. This culminated in the New York Jets offering Alabama QB Joe Namath a then unheard of $400,000 contract. During the spring of 1966, NFL and AFL heads met and agreed to an eventual merger into one big league, but only when the latter was deemed up to parity. Until then, the champions of both leagues would meet on a neutral site in January to determine the ultimate champion.\n\nThe Packers meanwhile had one of the [[1966 Green Bay Packers season|finest seasons in franchise history]], finishing 12-2 and with Bart Starr being named league MVP. They met the Eastern Conference winner [[1966 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the Cotton Bowl for the [[1966 NFL Championship Game|NFL championship]]. This celebrated game saw the Packers win 34\u201327. The Packers went on to defeat the AFL's [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 35\u201310 in [[Super Bowl I|the first ever Super Bowl]] (then called the AFL-NFL World Championship Game) at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum|L.A. Coliseum]]. Bart Starr was named the game's MVP.\n\n[[1967 Green Bay Packers season|1967]] marked Vince Lombardi's final triumph. The Packers team was visibly aging, and they finished 9-4-1. However, they still proved all-but-invincible at home as they beat the 11-1-2 [[1967 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] 28\u20137 in Milwaukee to again contest the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|league championship]] with [[1967 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]]. This game at Lambeau Field became known as the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|\"Ice Bowl\"]] due to the frigid weather conditions. But again, Green Bay prevailed with a score of 21\u201317.  The Packers now had to [[Super Bowl II|face the AFL champions]] (this time the [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]) in Miami's [[Orange Bowl]]. By this point, Lombardi and the team were much more confident of victory as they easily beat Oakland 33\u201314. Again, Starr was named the Super Bowl MVP.\n\nBy winning the 1967 NFL Championship Game, the Packers achieved a \"three-peat\" (three consecutive league championships) for only the second time in franchise history and the first time since they were named league champions following the 1929\u201331 seasons.  To this day, no other NFL team has matched or surpassed this record.  The Packers' back-to-back wins in the first two Super Bowls remains a Super Bowl record, and has since been tied seven times by six other franchises: the Miami Dolphins won Super Bowls VII and VIII following the 1972 and 1973 seasons, the Pittsburgh Steelers won Super Bowls IX and X following the 1974 and 1975 seasons as well as Super Bowls XIII and XIV following the 1978 and 1979 seasons and remain, to date, the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowl titles more than once, the San Francisco 49ers won Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV following the 1988 and 1989 seasons, the Dallas Cowboys won Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII following the 1992 and 1993 seasons, the Denver Broncos won Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII following the 1997 and 1998 seasons, and most recently, the New England Patriots won Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX following the 2003 and 2004 seasons.\n\nAfter the franchise's victory in [[Super Bowl II]], Vince Lombardi announced that he was stepping down as head coach, although he would retain the title of general manager. [[Phil Bengtson]] took his place.\n\n==The second \"Dark Ages\" (1968-1991)==\nPredictably, the [[1968 Green Bay Packers season|1968 season]] did not see an impressive performance from the Packers (6-7-1) as Bengtson proved unable to fill Lombardi's shoes and key players retired. Meanwhile, an exhausted Vince Lombardi announced his retirement from football altogether, and Phil Bengtson assumed the GM position. The Packers improved to 8\u20136 in [[1969 Green Bay Packers season|1969]], but players continued to retire.\n\nMeanwhile, Vince Lombardi had been seduced out of retirement by the Redskins, who made him HC and 50% owner of that team. He led them to a [[1969 Washington Redskins season|7-5-2 record in 1969]], thus preserving his streak of having never coached a team to a losing season. However, Lombardi fell ill with cancer during the 1970 off-season and died at the age of 57.\n\nThe newly merged NFL named the Super Bowl trophy in his honor, and the street in front of Lambeau Field was named Lombardi Avenue. Meanwhile, the Packers finished [[1970 Green Bay Packers season|1970]] 6\u20138, which included being shut out by Detroit twice. Dejected at his inability to match the standards of his illustrious predecessor, Phil Bengtson resigned as head coach. [[Dan Devine]] assumed the job and began the task of replacing the '60s players with fresh, young talent. Bart Starr himself was the last to go after starting in only four games during [[1971 Green Bay Packers season|1971]] in which he threw three interceptions, scored one rushing touchdown, and had 24 completions in 45 attempts. Most of the work in 1971 was done by newly drafted QB Scott Hunter, and at the close of the season, Starr retired at the age of 36.\n\nPoor drafting of players was a key reason for why the Packers had little success for almost a quarter of a century after Lombardi's departure.  To cite a few examples, in the first round of the [[1972 NFL Draft|1972 draft]], when future Hall of Fame running back [[Franco Harris]] was still available, the Packers instead chose mediocre quarterback [[Jerry Tagge]]. In [[1981 NFL Draft|1981]], when no fewer than three future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] defenders were still available -- [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Mike Singletary]], and [[Howie Long]], the Packers chose another mediocre quarterback, [[Rich Campbell (American football)|Rich Campbell]]. Finally, in [[1989 NFL Draft|1989]], when such future legends as [[Barry Sanders]], [[Deion Sanders]], and [[Derrick Thomas]] were available, the Packers chose offensive lineman [[Tony Mandarich]]. Though rated highly by nearly every professional scout at the time, Mandarich's performance failed to meet expectations.\n\nAlthough the Packers would not have winning success until [[1992 NFL season|1992]], there were moments when the Packers at times resembled the old Packer days of the 1960s. In [[1972 Green Bay Packers season|1972]], led by workhorse running backs [[John Brockington]] and new Packer [[MacArthur Lane]], and a sturdy defense that featured rookie [[Willie Buchanon]], the Packers captured the NFC Central Division Title with a 10&ndash;4 record. That team would lose in the playoffs to the [[1972 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] 16\u20133. In [[1975 Green Bay Packers season|1975]] under new head coach Bart Starr the Packers won only 4 games, but in one of those wins, the Packers beat the eventual 1975 NFC Champion [[1975 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 19&ndash;17 on October 19 in Dallas.\n\n[[1976 Green Bay Packers season|1976]] was another losing campaign, with the Packers only achieving a 5\u20139 record, the lowest in their division. The team dropped back to a 4\u201310 season in [[1977 Green Bay Packers season|1977]]. The frequent changes of quarterbacks during this period was indicative of Green Bay's troubles. When the NFL expanded the regular season to 16 games the following year, the team won six of its first seven matches, but largely due to an easy schedule. After the Packers began facing tougher opponents, the wins dried up and the final record for [[1978 Green Bay Packers season|1978]] was 8-7-1.\n\nThe Packers had another 1,000 yard rusher in [[Terdell Middleton]]: he rushed for 1,116 yards. In the early 1980s, the Packers had a star-studded aerial attack led by quarterback [[Lynn Dickey]] and wide receivers [[James Lofton]] and [[John Jefferson]].\n\nWhile the 1978 season had raised the morale of Packers fans, it did not last, for the team finished with a 5\u201311 record in [[1979 Green Bay Packers season|1979]], and a 5-10-1 showing during an injury-plagued [[1980 Green Bay Packers season|1980]] season. In [[1981 Green Bay Packers season|1981]], the Packers came close to the playoffs, but lost the final game of the season, a road match against the [[1980 New York Jets season|New York Jets]], and ended up with an 8\u20138 record.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 16 - Eddie Lee Ivery.jpg|thumb|right|The Packers only qualified for the playoffs twice ([[1971\u201372 NFL playoffs|1972]] and [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|1982]] [''pictured'']) during the team's post-Lombardi \"dark ages\" (1969-1991).]]\nAfter the [[1982 Green Bay Packers season|1982]] season was reduced to nine games by a players' strike, the NFL held a special playoff tournament with the eight best teams in each conference. The 5-3-1 Packers qualified for this, routing the [[1982 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season |Cardinals]] 41\u201316, but in the next round lost to the [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] 37\u201326. It would be their only playoff win during this rough stretch in the team's history. Another [[1983 Green Bay Packers season|8-8 season]] the following year led to the dismissal of Bart Starr as head coach. [[Forrest Gregg]] succeeded him, but after two more 8\u20138 seasons, he decided to cut several aging players and start over with fresh rookies. The rejuvenated Packers produced a 4\u201312 record in [[1986 Green Bay Packers season|1986]], as was typical of a rebuilding period.\n\nAnother strike affected the NFL in [[1987 Green Bay Packers season|1987]], resulting in a 15-game season. During the strike, the league used substitute players. The Packers fill-ins won one game and lost two before the regulars returned, but in the end the struggling team managed only a 5-9-1 record. Afterwards, Forrest Gregg resigned and was replaced by [[Lindy Infante]]. Still, the team continued to struggle, going 4\u201312 in [[1988 Green Bay Packers season|1988]].\n\nWith such a weak record, the Packers gained the privilege of first-round draft picks during the 1989 off-season. They selected Michigan State offensive tackle [[Tony Mandarich]], who was getting considerable publicity due to his huge 325-pound frame. Mandarich (who later admitted to using steroids in college) proved a poor choice in the end, and after three seasons of mediocre performance was cut. The [[1989 Green Bay Packers season|1989 campaign]] was the best in 17 years, with the Packers compiling a 10\u20136 record (including a victory over the eventual [[Super Bowl XXIV]] Champion [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]]), but still missing the playoffs. There followed another two losing seasons, with 6-10 and 4-12 records. A general overhaul took place during the 1992 off-season, with [[Mike Holmgren]] replacing Lindy Infante. Most importantly however, the Packers acquired second-year quarterback [[Brett Favre]] from the [[Atlanta Falcons]].\n\n==1992-1997: A new golden era==\n\nFavre would get off to a slow start, losing five of his first seven games, but afterwards won six in a row. The Packers finished [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|1992]] with a 9\u20137 record. In the [[1993 Green Bay Packers season|1993]] off-season, the team signed free-agent defensive end [[Reggie White]]. After another slow start, the Packers swept ahead for a 9\u20137 record, reaching the playoffs for the first time in eleven years. In the NFC wild card round, they faced the [[1993 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]], who had beaten them the previous week. In a close game, Favre led the team to a 28\u201324 victory, but in the divisional playoff round Green Bay was overwhelmed 27-17 by the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], the eventual Super Bowl winner. Brett Favre would also make the Pro Bowl following that season.\n\nThe [[1994 Green Bay Packers season|1994 season]] was a near-rerun of the previous year. Again the Packers went 9\u20137, beat the [[1994 Detroit Lions season|Lions]] 16\u201312 in the NFC wild card round, and lost the divisional game 35\u20139 to the [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]]. In [[1995 Green Bay Packers season|1995]], Favre continued to cement his reputation as one of the NFL's finest quarterbacks, passing for 4,413 yards and scoring 38 touchdown passes during the team's 11-5 regular season. The Packers reached the top of the NFC Central division for the first time since 1971. However, they still had to go through the wildcard round, overpowering [[1995 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]] 37\u201320. The divisional round saw them knock out the defending Super Bowl champion [[1995 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] 27\u201317, but they were again frustrated by the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]], who triumphed 38\u201327 in the NFC Championship game and went on to win another Super Bowl title.\n\nAs the [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|1996 season]] began, the Packers were more determined than ever to reach the Super Bowl. Beginning with an eight-game winning streak, they faced the hated [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] during Week 11 on a Monday Night game. The Packers suffered a smarting loss, the score being 21\u20136. After this, they won the last five regular season games, finishing with a record of 13\u20133. Reaching the top of the NFC Central division, they were able to skip the wild card round this time. In the divisional playoff, they easily defeated [[1996 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]] at Lambeau, with a score of 35\u201314. Meanwhile, the Cowboys had lost to the [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], and so the Packers would have to face this two-year-old expansion team in the NFC Championship match. The Packers beat them 30\u201313 to advance to Super Bowl XXXI.\n\n===Super Bowl XXXI===\n\nFacing Green Bay in the New Orleans Superdome in [[Super Bowl XXXI]] were the AFC champion [[1996 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. In a see-saw game, the Packers gained a 27\u201314 lead at halftime, which they never lost despite a valiant effort by their opponent. The final score was 35\u201321, and Green Bay had won its first championship since 1967.  Kick returner [[Desmond Howard]], who returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown late in the 3rd quarter, was named the game's MVP, becoming the first (and to date, only) Super Bowl MVP on the merits of special teams play.\n\nThe defending champions would have an easy go of the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|1997 season]], which saw a record of 13\u20133. Brett Favre passed for 3,867 yards and was named the league's MVP third year in a row. In their fifth consecutive playoff appearance, the Packers rolled over the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 21\u20137 in the divisional round, then beat the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] 23\u201310 in the NFC Championship to make the Super Bowl for the second year in a row.\n\n===Super Bowl XXXII===\n\nPlaying in San Diego's [[Qualcomm Stadium]] for [[Super Bowl XXXII]], the Packers would this time engage the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], who had lost in all their previous Super Bowl appearances. In a game that was even more see-saw than Super Bowl XXXI, Denver had taken the lead in the 4th quarter, with a score of 24\u201317.  Denver took its final lead with under 2 minutes in the game when head coach Mike Holmgren intentionally allowed [[Terrell Davis]] to score the go-ahead touchdown.  In the final minute of the game, Brett Favre threw a desperate pass at tight end [[Mark Chmura]], but it failed and the Broncos walked home with the Lombardi Trophy, ending a 13-year losing streak for the AFC in the Super Bowl.\n\n==1998-2005: Near Successes ==\n[[Image:Bubba Franks88-Edit.jpg|thumb|Former Packers' tight end [[Bubba Franks]], 2007]]\nStill playing strong football, the Packers compiled an 11\u20135 record in [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|1998]], but suffered several key injuries. They made the playoffs for the sixth year in a row, but this time as a wild card. Again, Green Bay faced its perennial foe the [[1998 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], but luck would not be on their side this time, as they lost a close game, 30\u201327, on a [[Terrell Owens]] touchdown catch with 3 seconds remaining.  Afterwards, Mike Holmgren stepped down as head coach and was succeeded by [[Ray Rhodes]]. The Packers only managed an 8-8 showing in [[1999 Green Bay Packers season|1999]] and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1992, despite a high-scoring season-ending performance against Arizona in an attempt to win a potential points-scored tiebreaker. Rhodes was quickly dumped and replaced by Mike Sherman.  In [[2000 Green Bay Packers season|2000]], the Packers finished 9\u20137, but again did not make the playoffs.\n\nGreen Bay rebounded nicely in [[2001 Green Bay Packers season|2001]], going 12-4 and returning to the playoffs as a wild card. Per established practice, they challenged the [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] and beat them 25\u201315, avenging their playoff loss three years earlier. There would be no Super Bowl appearance though, as Green Bay was crushed by the [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] in the divisional round 45\u201317. Favre threw a record six interceptions, three of which were returned for touchdowns. The [[2002 Green Bay Packers season|following year]] began strongly, with the Packers starting 8\u20131. Divisional realignment had placed them along with Minnesota, Chicago, and Detroit in the new NFC North. Being the only team in their division to achieve a record above .500 in 2002, the Packers seemed a virtual shoo-in for the first-round bye. However, they lost the final game of the season at the [[2002 New York Jets season|New York Jets]], which gave Green Bay the #3 NFC seed and forced them to go through the wild card round.  The playoffs would have a humiliating end as the Packers were routed 27-7 by the [[2002 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] on a snow-covered Lambeau Field for the franchise's first-ever home playoff loss.\n\n[[2003 Green Bay Packers season|2003]] began rather badly.  Lambeau Field had been renovated that year, but in the season opener, the Packers lost to the [[2003 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]] 30\u201325.  Brett Favre suffered several injuries during the season, and also had to deal with the death of his father on the eve of a Monday Night trip to Oakland.  However, Favre started, and put up an impressive performance as the Packers trounced the [[2003 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] 41\u20137. The Packers went into the final week needing to win and the Vikings to lose to win the NFC North in order to get the last playoff spot.  The Packers beat the [[2003 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] while the [[2003 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] rallied in the final seconds to beat the Vikings, giving the Packers the NFC North championship with an 11\u20135 record. The wild card round saw a fierce struggle with the [[2003 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], which tied 27-27 and went into overtime.  Defensive back Al Harris intercepted a pass from former Packer quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] and returned it 52 yards for a touchdown, giving the Packers the win. In the divisional round, the Packers lost to [[2003 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia]]. That game also went into overtime, tied 17-17, but Favre threw a pass up into the air that was intercepted by Eagles safety [[Brian Dawkins]]. Several plays later, the Eagles kicked a field goal and won 20\u201317.\n\nIn [[2004 Green Bay Packers season|2004]], Green Bay compiled a 10\u20136 season and reached the playoffs as a wildcard, but lost to the [[2004 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]] 31\u201317 in the first-ever playoff meeting between the two rivals.\n\nDuring the [[2005 Green Bay Packers season|2005]] off-season, the team drafted quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] from California. Rodgers was intended to be the eventual successor to Favre, now 36 years old and showing his age by turning in a poor performance that year. Despite a devastating 52\u20133 win over New Orleans in Week 5, Favre threw a career-high 29 interceptions. Injuries caused the team further problems, and the season ended with a 4\u201312 record, the worst since 1991. This season was notable for two bizarre incidents. The first was during the Week 8 game in Cincinnati where a fan ran out onto the field and grabbed the ball from Favre, and during Week 12 in Philadelphia where another fan ran out and scattered the ashes of his dead mother into the air.\n\nHead coach Mike Sherman was fired at the end of the 2005 season.\n\n==2006-present: Titletown Reborn==\n\n===2006 season===\n\nIt was widely expected that Brett Favre would retire in the [[2006 Green Bay Packers season|2006]] off-season, but he eventually decided to continue playing. In addition, the team hired a new coach, [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]]. The regular season started badly, with the Packers being shut out at home by the Bears. An uneven stretch followed, and again Green Bay would not reach the playoffs, going 8-8.\n\n===2007 season: Brett Favre's final season as starting quarterback===\n\n[[2007 Green Bay Packers season|2007]] witnessed a remarkable resurgence of the Packers.  They won their first four games, then fell to the Bears in Week 5.  Green Bay would go on to lose only two more regular season games: a loss to the [[2007 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], and a heavy 35\u20137 defeat at [[2007 Chicago Bears season|Chicago]]. With a 13\u20133 record, Green Bay emerged at the top of the NFC North and gained a first-round bye in the playoffs. In the divisional round, they rolled over the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] 42\u201320 in a snowy home game, then advanced to the NFC Championship. Also played at Lambeau, this game pitted Green Bay against the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. With below-zero temperatures, it was one of the coldest games in NFL history, and undoubtedly affected the 38-year-old Favre's performance. The game was tied 20\u201320 at the end of regulation and went into overtime.  After two failed attempts, combined with an interception by Favre, the Giants managed a field goal from [[Lawrence Tynes]], winning 23-20 and eventually going on to win [[Super Bowl XLII]].\n\n===2008 season: Beginning of Aaron Rodgers era===\n\nIn March [[2008 Green Bay Packers season|2008]], Favre announced his retirement, and as planned, Aaron Rodgers stepped up as starting quarterback. Before the team publicly declared Rodgers their quarterback of the future, however, the team asked Favre if he was certain about retirement. If not, he would be welcome to play another year as the face of their franchise. At the time he said he was comfortable with his decision and that he would not be returning to football. But as the summer approached, Favre suddenly decided that he wasn't ready to retire after all, and petitioned NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] for a comeback. Goodell granted his request, but the Packers were ready to begin anew with Rodgers and had no interest in taking Favre back. They went so far as to offer him $25 million to stay in retirement, but he rejected it. There followed a three-week war of words between Favre and the Packers management until he threatened to sign with the Minnesota Vikings. The thought of that caused Green Bay's front office to panic, and they decided that he could join the New York Jets in exchange for a conditional draft pick. Favre complied, signaling the end of his reign in Green Bay and the beginning of the Aaron Rodgers era.\n\nThe new quarterback got off to a slow start, winning his first two games as starter over Minnesota and Detroit, then losing the next three. Then Green Bay won two against the Seahawks and Colts, afterwards losing to the Titans and Vikings.  Aside from a 37\u20133 victory over Chicago, the rest of the season was one of losses, with a final 6\u201310 record. Green Bay closed the year on an upbeat note, winning 31\u201321 over Detroit on a clear, freezing day at Lambeau and giving the Lions an [[2008 Detroit Lions season|imperfect season]].\n\n===2009 season===\n\nIn August [[2009 Green Bay Packers season|2009]], Brett Favre, after his stint with the Jets, signed with [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]], provoking outrage among Packers fans. The regular season got off to a poor start, as the Packers were unable to defeat any opponents with a winning record. In Week 4, the team travelled to the Metrodome to face their former quarterback, losing 30\u201323. Following easy wins over Detroit and Cleveland, they hosted the Vikings in Week 8. Packers fans burned effigies of Favre, who was greeted by a chorus of boos and obscenities as he stepped onto Lambeau Field in the uniform of Green Bay's hated rival. Minnesota won the game handsomely, 38\u201326. The lowest point came a week later, when the Packers lost to the then-winless [[2009 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 38\u201328. After that, however, they recovered and swept through the next five games. Following a one-point loss to Pittsburgh, they defeated the Seahawks and Cardinals to secure a wild card spot in the playoffs.  This was the 16th time in the last 17 years that they had won their regular season finale. Having to face [[2009 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona]] again in the wild card round, the Packers waged a monumental struggle and managed to tie the game 45\u201345 at the end of the regulation, sending it into overtime. Two minutes in, the Cardinals scored a touchdown on a fumble return and ended Green Bay's playoff run. With a final score of 51\u201345, the game set a record for the highest-scoring playoff game in NFL history. Throughout the season, the Packers struggled with their offensive line, which was rated the worst in the league. Aaron Rodgers was sacked 50 times in the regular season ([[Matt Flynn]] was sacked once in relief of Rodgers) and hit 93 times. In the playoff game with Arizona, he took another five sacks and ten hits.\n\n===2010 season: Super Bowl XLV championship===\n\nGreen Bay's [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|2010]] off-season was mainly concentrated on improving their faulty offensive line. In the season opener, the Packers faced an Eagles team that was playing without quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] for the first time in a decade. However, the offensive line failed to deliver again as Rodgers took three sacks in the first half and also threw an interception. Meanwhile, Philadelphia's new quarterback, [[Kevin Kolb]], was pulled with a concussion and replaced by [[Michael Vick]]. After a while, the Packers' defense adjusted to him and Green Bay pulled off a 27\u201320 win, their first in Philadelphia since 1962. Second-year linebacker Clay Matthews (who knocked Kolb down) delivered an impressive{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2015}} performance in the game. After an easy{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2015}} win over Buffalo in Week 2, the Packers traveled to Chicago for a Monday Night matchup with their oldest rival. However, Green Bay exhibited very poor discipline and was plagued by numerous penalties, which had been a persistent problem ever since Mike McCarthy became head coach in 2006. The Packers lost the game 20\u201317. After this loss, the team returned home to face the 0-3 Lions in Week 4. They escaped with a 28\u201326 win, but it was an embarrassment{{Says who|date=August 2015}} to have given up that many points to a team that had not won in Green Bay since 1991 and which had won just two games over the last two seasons. The Packers' woes continued in Washington the next week. Clay Matthews ran Donovan McNabb down repeatedly in the first half of the game, but was then pulled with a hamstring sprain. This took most of the pressure off the Redskins' offense and the game tied at 13-13. Two minutes into overtime, Rodgers threw an interception and was knocked to the ground by Redskins defensive end Jeremy Jarmon with a concussion. Redskins kicker [[Graham Gano]] then booted a 33-yard field goal to win the game 16\u201313. Matthews and other key defensive players were missing from the Week 6 game at home versus Miami, leading to another overtime loss (23-20).\n\nIn Week 7, the injury-thinned team hosted [[2010 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] on Sunday Night. Again, Brett Favre was booed by the crowd at Lambeau, but the outcome would be different this time as Green Bay took advantage of their opponent's miscues (including three Favre interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown) to win 28\u201324. Following this emotional game, the Packers gained a surprise 9\u20130 win over the 6-1 New York Jets by kicking three field goals and shutting an opponent out on the road for the first time since 1991.\n\nIn Week 9, the Packers returned home for another Sunday Night game, this time with the struggling 1-7 [[2010 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]]. Green Bay quickly marched out to two touchdowns in the first quarter, en route to a 45-7 crushing of their opponent. Following their bye week, the Packers headed to Minnesota for a rematch with the Vikings, who virtually laid down in much the same manner as Dallas. Green Bay quickly buried them 31\u20133, causing their head coach, [[Brad Childress]], to be fired. It was the second consecutive game in which the team that lost to the Packers fired their head coach afterwards, as [[Wade Phillips]] had been fired by the Cowboys after their loss to the Packers.\n\nNext came a difficult road battle with the 8-2 [[2010 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], in which the Packers lost a close one 20\u201317. After routing San Francisco, the Packers headed to Detroit. What looked like an easy win proved anything but when Rodgers was knocked out with a concussion during a quarterback sneak and replaced by Matt Flynn. The latter was unable to get anything going as Green Bay lost a defensive struggle 7\u20133, falling to the Lions for the first time since 2005. Rodgers was then ruled out for the Week 15 game at New England.\n\nDespite dire predictions, the Packers marched out to an early lead and the game remained close throughout.  Flynn threw three touchdown passes, but in the end, [[Tom Brady]]'s greater experience prevailed as the [[2010 New England Patriots season|Patriots]] won 31\u201327. This game was nonetheless a turning point for the Packers, having been inspired by nearly beating the best team in the NFL when no one gave them a remote chance.\n\nWith an 8\u20136 record, the Packers needed to win their last two games to gain the #6 seed, the last seed, in the NFC playoffs. The Packers easily beat the New York Giants at home 45-17 and then hosted the rival Bears for the final game of the season. The Packers won the defensive struggle 10\u20133, sealing the Packers' playoff berth.\n\nIn the wild card round, the Packers had to travel to Philadelphia to play the hot [[2010 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]], led by Michael Vick. Rodgers threw for 3 touchdowns and rookie halfback [[James Starks]] had a 100+ yard running game.  [[Tramon Williams]] had an interception in the closing minutes sealing a Packer victory, 21\u201316.\n\nThe next game was against the Falcons in Atlanta.  Atlanta was the number-1 seed and was favored to beat Green Bay, but the Packers shocked the Atlanta fans by having a 28\u201314 lead at halftime, with Tramon Williams returning an interception for a touchdown in the final seconds of the first half. The Packers scored on the opening drive of the second half and the Falcons never recovered, as Green Bay rolled to a 48\u201321 win, sending the Packers to the NFC Championship game.\n\nThe NFC Championship game would be against the [[2010 Chicago Bears season|Bears]] in Chicago, in what was considered by almost everyone the biggest game ever in the Packers-Bears 90-year-old rivalry.  The game was only the second ever postseason meeting between the two storied rivals and the first playoff meeting between the teams since 1941, when they met in a one-game playoff for their division's championship, which the Bears won 33\u201314 in order to qualify for the [[1941 NFL Championship Game]], where they defeated the New York Giants.  The Packers scored on the opening drive on a touchdown run by Rodgers, and scored again in the second quarter on a run by Starks, giving the Packers a 14\u20130 lead at halftime. The defense was able to knock Bears starting quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] out of the game with a knee injury and soon after also knocked out back-up Todd Collins. In the fourth quarter, the Bears rallied with third-string quarterback [[Caleb Hanie]]. However, two key interceptions, one by defensive tackle [[B. J. Raji]] returned for a touchdown, and another by [[Sam Shields]] with less than a minute left, sealed the NFC championship for the Packers, who won 21\u201314.\n\nThe Packers played the [[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], who were seeking a record seventh Super Bowl title, in [[Super Bowl XLV]] at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in Arlington, Texas. The Packers struck first with two touchdowns near the end of the first quarter, one on a [[Jordy Nelson]] touchdown catch and the other on a [[Nick Collins]] interception return. Collins' touchdown marked the third consecutive playoff game in which the Packers returned an interception for a touchdown. The first half ended with the Packers leading 21\u201310, but they had lost both cornerback [[Charles Woodson]] and wide receiver [[Donald Driver]] to injury. The Steelers started to rally, but the Packers defense caused a key fumble on the first play of the fourth quarter and later stopped the Steelers on their final drive, winning their fourth Super Bowl and their record 13th overall NFL championship, 31\u201325. Aaron Rodgers was voted the game's MVP. With the win, the Packers joined the Steelers, 49ers and Cowboys as the only NFL teams to win at least four Super Bowls. They would eventually be joined by the New York Giants, who won their fourth Super Bowl ([[Super Bowl XLVI]]) following the 2011 season, and the New England Patriots, who won their fourth Super Bowl ([[Super Bowl XLIX]]) following the 2014 season.\n\n===2011 season: 15-1 regular season===\n\nDespite a lack of practices and training due to a lockout in the off-season, the Packers defeated New Orleans 42\u201334, hosting the first game of the [[2011 Green Bay Packers season|2011]] season. After a touch-and-go battle with Carolina in Week 2, the Packers came out on top 30\u201323. Week 3 saw the rematch with Chicago, in which Green Bay again prevailed 27\u201317 to get off to a 3\u20130 start. Green Bay breezed to another easy win over the Broncos to remain unbeaten at 4\u20130. The Packers became the only undefeated team in Week 5 when Detroit lost to San Francisco and they beat a winless Rams squad. The Packers then went on to win their next four in a row to end the first half of the season with a record of 8\u20130.\n\nIn week 12, the Giants posed to be their greatest challenge thus far. The Giants tied the game 35-35 late in the 4th quarter.  But in the last final minute, the Packers persevered and won the game on a [[Mason Crosby]] field goal. They continued their winning streak into the second half of the season, bringing them to 12-0 and assuring the Packers an appearance in the NFL's 2011 postseason.<ref>{{cite web|last=Associated Press|title=Rodgers engineers last-minute drive to overcome Giants, keep Packers unbeaten|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=311204019}}</ref>\n\nTalk of an undefeated season finally ended in Week 15 when the Packers lost in Kansas City. Returning home, they beat an injury-depleted Bears team and while resting their starters in Week 17, Matt Flynn carried Green Bay to a wild shootout victory over Detroit. With a 15-1 finish and the #1 playoff seed, the Packers completed the 2011 regular season with the best record in franchise history.  They were the sixth, and are the most recent, team to win at least 15 games in a regular season, equaled by the [[1984 San Francisco 49ers season|1984 San Francisco 49ers]], [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]], [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|1998 Minnesota Vikings]], and [[2004 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2004 Pittsburgh Steelers]], and bettered by only the [[2007 New England Patriots season|2007 New England Patriots]], who recorded a perfect 16-0 regular season.  As they were the #1 seed, the Packers received a first-round bye and home field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. After sitting out the wild-card round, Green Bay's post season came to an abrupt end in the divisional playoffs as the [[2011 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] (who went on to win [[Super Bowl XLVI]]) defeated them 37\u201320.\n\n===2012-2016: Playoff Struggles===\n\nIn 2012, the Packers went 11\u20135. They beat the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Wildcard round 24\u201310, and lost in the Divisional round 45\u201331 to the [[Super Bowl XLVII|eventual NFC champion]] San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIn 2013, the Packers went 8-7-1, losing to the San Francisco 49ers 20\u201323 in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nIn 2014, the Packers recorded their 700th victory against the Bears in week four.  The Packers are only the second team in NFL history to record 700 victories; the Bears were the first team to do it in 2010.  The team finished the regular season undefeated (8-0) in home games and 12-4 overall, and clinched the #2 seed in the NFC Playoffs.  After a first-round bye, they faced the Dallas Cowboys at home for the first time in the postseason since they won the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|\"Ice Bowl\"]].  There was a lot of hype in the week leading up to the game since during the regular season, the Packers had gone undefeated in home games while Dallas had gone undefeated in away games.  Green Bay defeated Dallas 26\u201321 to advance to the NFC Championship, where they faced the defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks.  After leading throughout most of regulation they lost 28\u201322 in a historic overtime rally by Seattle, who came up short in their bid for a second consecutive league title when they lost to the New England Patriots 28\u201324 in Super Bowl XLIX two weeks later.\n\nIn 2015, the Packers lost wide receiver [[Jordy Nelson]] to a torn ACL in the preseason. The Packers got off to a 6\u20130 start, but then went 1\u20134 to sit at 7-4 after Week 12. During Week 13 at Detroit, after trailing 20\u20130 in the second half, Aaron Rodgers threw a 61-yard Hail Mary pass to tight end [[Richard Rodgers]] with no time left on the clock to [[Miracle in Motown|win the game 27-23]] after a facemask penalty was called on Detroit as time expired. The Packers clinched their seventh consecutive playoff berth with a Week 15 win at the [[Oakland Raiders]], but lost the division title to the [[Minnesota Vikings|Vikings]] in Week 17. With a 10\u20136 record, the Packers secured the fifth seed in the playoffs. They beat the fourth-seeded [[Washington Redskins]] on the road 35-18 and traveled to face the second-seeded [[Arizona Cardinals]]. A similar play to what happened in Week 13 at Detroit occurred in the last 5 seconds when Aaron Rodgers threw a Hail Mary pass to wide receiver [[Jeff Janis]] to send the game to overtime. Unfortunately, the Packers' season ended when they lost to the Cardinals 26\u201320 in overtime.\n\nIn 2016, the Packers struggled throughout the first half of the season, sitting at 4-6 and on the verge of being eliminated from playoff contention. After their Week 10 loss at Washington, Aaron Rodgers said that the Packers could run the table and win their last six games. Despite widespread doubt of such a run, the Packers won their last six games of the season to finish the season with a 10\u20136 record and clinch the NFC North with a Week 17 win at Detroit. The Packers routed the fifth-seeded [[New York Giants]] 38\u201313 in the Wild Card round at Lambeau Field and upset the top-seeded [[Dallas Cowboys]] 34\u201331 at [[AT&T Stadium]] before falling to the second-seeded [[Atlanta Falcons]] 44\u201321 in the NFC Championship Game, which was the last NFL game ever played at the [[Georgia Dome]].\n\nIn 2017, the Packers started the season strong, going 4\u20131, until week 6, against the Minnesota Vikings. Early in the game, Aaron Rodgers was tackled hard by Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr, suffering a severe shoulder injury that would keep him out for the majority of the season. The Packers' offense struggled under backup quarterback Brett Hundley, losing 5 of their next 6 games, before getting back-to-back overtime victories over Tampa Bay and Cleveland. Aaron Rodgers returned for the next game, with the Packers at 7-6 and still in playoff contention. However, the Packers' attempt at a comeback against the Carolina Panthers fell short, with the Packers losing 31\u201324, eliminating them from the playoffs. Aaron Rodgers was benched for the last two games of the season, which were also Packers loses, causing the team to finish 7\u20139, their first losing season in 10 years. In the offseason, Ted Thompson, citing health issues, announced his resignation as general manager, and defensive coordinator Dom Capers was fired. Thompson was replaced with Brian Gutekunst, and Capers was replaced with Mike Pettine.\n\nThe 2018 season, which was the Packers' 100th season of existence, there was renewed hope in the Packers' rebounding, but the inconsistency with both the offense and defense caused the Packers to lose many close games, and also lose games against teams that, on paper, were supposedly worse than the Packers. The final straw came in a 20\u201317 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, which was the Cardinals' first-ever win at Lambeau Field, which also eliminated the Packers from the playoffs for the second season in a row. Head coach Mike McCarthy was promptly fired after the game, marking the first time ever the Packers had fired a coach during the regular season, and only the second time a head coach had left during the season (Gene Ronzani resigned in the middle of the 1953 season). Offensive coordinator Joe Philbin coached the Packers through the rest of the season, which finished with an even worse 6-9-1 mark.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{Green Bay Packers}}\n{{NFL team history}}\n\n[[Category:Green Bay Packers]]\n[[Category:National Football League history by team|Green Bay Packers]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=December 2017}}\n[[Image:Old Packers Jacket Edit.JPG|thumb|right|200px|An old [[Green Bay Packers]] jacket on exhibit in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].]]\nThe [[Green Bay Packers]] are a professional [[American football]] team that has played professionally in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) since 1921. The team was founded in 1919 by [[Curly Lambeau]] and [[George Whitney Calhoun]], and for the next two years played against local teams in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]]. In 1921, the Packers joined the ''American Professional Football Association'', the precursor to the (NFL) with Curly Lambeau as their coach. After falling into financial trouble, the Green Bay Football Corporation, now known as [[Green Bay Packers, Inc.]], was formed in 1923. The Packers became a publicly owned football team run by a board of directors elected each year. The team went on to win six NFL championships from 1929 to 1944, including three straight (1929&ndash;1931). Along the way, Curly Lambeau, with the help of receiver [[Don Hutson]], revolutionized football through the development and utilization of the forward pass.\n\nAfter Curly Lambeau resigned from the Packers in 1949, the team fell into a slump. They did not have a winning record for 11 straight seasons until 1959, the year that the Packers hired a new coach, [[Vince Lombardi]]. Lombardi would go on to lead one of the most successful teams in league history. Thirteen [[Pro Football Hall of Famers]] played for Lombardi, including quarterback [[Bart Starr]] and linebacker [[Ray Nitschke]]. The Packers lost the 1960 NFL Championship, however they would go on to win five championships in seven years under Lombardi, including three straight between 1965 and 1967. This included the infamous [[1967 NFL Championship Game|Ice Bowl]] and the first two [[Super Bowl]]s. After the passing of Curly Lambeau in 1965, the Packers new stadium (built in 1957 as ''City Stadium'') was named [[Lambeau Field]] in his honor. Five years later, the Packers second great coach, Vince Lombardi, died, just two years after leaving the team for the [[Washington Redskins]].\n\nFrom 1968 to 1992 the Packers only made the playoffs twice. Even with former quarterback Bart Starr as head coach, the Packers were unable to regain their former glory. The team continued to falter until [[Ron Wolf]] took over as general manager. Wolf hired [[Mike Holmgren]] as head coach and traded a first-round draft pick to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] for quarterback [[Brett Favre]]. Favre would go on to lead the Packers to eleven playoffs appearances, two Super Bowl appearances, and one championship in 1996. In 1997, the Packers had their fourth stock sale, expanding the number of shareholders and using the money to fund further expansion of Lambeau Field. In 2005, the Packers drafted quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]]. After Favre left the team in 2007, Rodgers became the starter. {{As of|2017}}, he has led the Packers to eight playoffs appearances and one [[Super Bowl XLV|Super Bowl victory in 2010]]. The Packers had their fifth and most recent stock sale in 2012, again expanding the number of shareholders and using the funding to expand Lambeau Field. With a capacity of 81,441, Lambeau Field is the [[List of American football stadiums by capacity|fifth-largest stadium]] in the NFL. {{As of|2018}}, the Packers hold the record for the most NFL championships (13 total) and the second-most wins in NFL history.\n\n==Founding==\n[[File:Greenbay  packers 1920.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 1920 Green Bay Packers.]]\nThe Green Bay Packers were founded on August 11, 1919, by [[Curly Lambeau]] and [[George Whitney Calhoun]].<ref>[http://www.packers.com/history/birth-of-a-team-and-a-legend.html \"Birth of a Team and a Legend\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218235758/http://www.packers.com/history/birth-of-a-team-and-a-legend.html |date=2014-02-18 }} on Packers website</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Names |first1=Larry D |editor1-first=Greg |editor1-last=Scott |title=The History of the Green Bay Packers: The Lambes the oldest team name still in use in the NFL.}} The Green Bay Packers are the oldest NFL franchise in continuous operation with the same name and the same location.</ref> Lambeau solicited funds for uniforms from his employer, the [[Indian Packing Company]]. He was given $500 for uniforms and equipment.\n\nThe [[1919 Green Bay Packers season]] was their first season of competitive football. The club played against other teams in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]] and ended the season with a 10\u20131 record, losing only to the [[Beloit Fairies]].\n\nThe team became the Acme Packers{{snd}}under the ownership of the Clair brothers{{snd}}and a professional franchise when they joined the newly formed ''American Professional Football Association'' on August 27, 1921. However, the franchise was revoked by the league at the end of the season when the Packers were revealed to have used college players in a game. As it turned out, the man who told the league of this was George Halas of the Chicago Staleys, who changed their name to the Bears the following year. This incident signaled the start of the infamous Packers-Bears rivalry. Lambeau appealed to the league and they allowed the franchise to be reinstated, though Lambeau had to pay the league entry fee of $50 to do so. Further troubles threatened to add more debt to the team, but local businessmen, known as \"[[The Hungry Five]],\" got behind the team and formed the Green Bay Football Corporation in 1923, which continues to run the franchise.\n\n==Public company==\n\nThe Packers are now the only publicly owned company with a [[Green Bay Packers Board of Directors|Board of Directors]] in American professional sports (although other teams, such as the [[Atlanta Braves]] <nowiki>[Liberty Media, previously Time Warner]</nowiki>, [[New York Rangers]] & [[New York Knicks]] <nowiki>[Cablevision]</nowiki>, the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] <nowiki>[Compuware]</nowiki>, and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] <nowiki>[Rogers Communications]</nowiki> are directly owned by publicly traded companies; additionally, three of the nine teams in [[Canada]]'s [[Canadian Football League]] exist with various forms of community ownership [the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] employ a similar ownership structure as the Packers; they have offered shares of the team periodically]). Typically, a team is owned by one person, partnership, or corporate entity; thus, a \"team owner.\" It has been speculated that this is one of the reasons the Green Bay Packers have never been moved from the city of Green Bay, a city of only 104,057 people in the 2010 census.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5531000.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923205832/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5531000.html |archivedate=2006-09-23 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greenbay packers 1921.jpg|thumb|left|220px|A formation of the Packers in 1921.]]\nBy comparison, the typical NFL football team city's population is in either the high hundred-thousands or the millions. The Packers, however, have long had a large following throughout [[Wisconsin]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]; in fact, for decades, the Packers played four (one pre-season, three regular-season) home games each year in [[Milwaukee]], first at the [[Wisconsin State Fair Park|State Fair Park]] fairgrounds, then at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]. The Packers did not move their entire home schedule to Green Bay until 1995.\n\nThe reason for ending the series of Milwaukee games, according to team president Robert Harlan, was the larger capacity of Lambeau Field and the availability of luxury boxes, which were not available at Milwaukee County Stadium.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/sports/pro-football-notebook-can-reich-again-rescue-the-bills.html | work=The New York Times | title=PRO FOOTBALL: NOTEBOOK; Can Reich Again Rescue the Bills? | first=Timothy W. | last=Smith | date=December 18, 1994 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> County Stadium's replacement, [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], then being planned, was always intended to be a [[baseball park|baseball-only stadium]] instead of a multipurpose stadium; County Stadium was closed and demolished in 2001, with Miller Park opening around the same time.\n\nBased on the original \"Articles of Incorporation for the (then) Green Bay Football Corporation\" put into place in 1923, if the Packers franchise was sold, after the payment of all expenses, any remaining monies would go to the Sullivan-Wallen Post of the [[American Legion]] in order to build \"a proper soldier's memorial.\" This stipulation was enacted to ensure the club remained in Green Bay and that there could never be any financial enhancement for the shareholders. At the November 1997 annual meeting, shareholders voted to change the beneficiary from the Sullivan-Wallen Post to the [[Green Bay Packers Foundation]].\n\nIn 1950, the Packers held a stock sale to again raise money to support the team. In 1956, area voters approved the construction of a new stadium, owned by the city. As with its predecessor, the new field was named City Stadium, but after the death of founder Lambeau in 1965, on September 11, 1965, the stadium was renamed [[Lambeau Field]].\n\nAnother stock sale occurred late in 1997 and early in 1998. It added 105,989 new shareholders and raised over $24 million, money used for the Lambeau Field redevelopment project. Priced at $200 per share, fans bought 120,010 shares during the 17-week sale, which ended March 16, 1998. As of June 8, 2005, 111,921 people (representing 4,749,925 shares) can lay claim to a franchise ownership interest. Shares of stock include voting rights, but the redemption price is minimal, no dividends are ever paid, the stock cannot appreciate in value, and stock ownership brings no season ticket privileges.\n\nNo shareholder may own over 200,000 shares, a safeguard to ensure that no individual can assume control of the club. To run the corporation, a board of directors is elected by the stockholders. The board of directors in turn elect a seven-member Executive Committee (officers) of the corporation, consisting of a president, vice president, treasurer, secretary and three members-at-large. The president is the only officer to draw compensation; The balance of the committee is sitting \"gratis.\"\n\nThe team's elected president represents the Packers in NFL owners meetings unless someone else is designated. During his time as coach, [[Vince Lombardi]] generally represented the team at league meetings in his role as general manager, except at owners-only meetings.\n\n==Championships==\nThe Packers have won 13 league championships, more than any other American professional football team (including 4 [[Super Bowl]]s).\nTheir arch-rivals the [[Chicago Bears]] are second, with nine NFL championships (including one Super Bowl). The [[Bears-Packers rivalry|historical rivalry]] with Chicago extends to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] - the Packers have the second most Hall of Famers (21, behind the Bears' 26). The Packers are also the only team to win three straight NFL titles, which they did twice (1929&ndash;1931 and 1965&ndash;67).\n\n==The first Championships (1929-1944)==\nAfter going through modest winning seasons during most of the 1920s, the Packers began to build a championship-caliber team, as they signed three future Hall of Famers in [[John McNally (American football)|\"Johnny Blood\" McNally]], [[Cal Hubbard]], and [[Mike Michalske]]. The Packers won their first NFL Championship in 1929 with a 12-0-1 record, the only undefeated season in Packers history. Their only blemish was a tie with the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]]. The Packers were able to successfully defend their title in 1930, going 10-3-1, and won their third straight league championship in 1931 with a 12\u20132 record.  The Packers nearly won a record fourth straight championship in 1932, going 10-3-1, but finished second behind the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans, who shared the best record in the league.  \n\nAs a side note, in 1928 the Packers also signed (for the third time) [[Frances Louis \u201cJug\u201d Earp]].  Jug played for Green Bay: 1922\u20131924, 1925\u20131927, & 1928\u20131932.)  He also was inducted into the [[Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame]] in 1970.  Jug and [[Wyatt Earp]] were first cousins.\n\nThe Packers scuffled in 1933 and 1934, having their first ever losing season in 1933 with a 5\u20137 record, followed by a mediocre 7-6 the following year. However, Curly Lambeau was able to build another elite team during these seasons, signing more future Hall of Famers like [[Clarke Hinkle]], [[Arnie Herber]], and most notably, receiver [[Don Hutson]] in 1935.\n\nThe Packers became a perennial championship team in the NFL for the next decade, playing in the NFL championship game four times. The Packers went a dominating 10-1-1 in 1936, defeating the [[Boston Redskins]] for the championship 21\u20136, then lost the title game to the New York Giants in 1938, then won the title back over the Giants in 1939, 27\u20130, and one more title, again over the Giants, in 1944, winning 14\u20137. The Packers stayed at the top of the standings thanks to the play of Hutson, Hinkle, Herber, another future Hall of Famer in [[Tony Canadeo]], and other standouts like [[Cecil Isbell]], [[Ted Fritsch]], [[Buckets Goldenberg]], and [[Russ Letlow]].\n\n==1945\u20131958==\nAlthough it was not apparent at the time, the 1944 title season was the start of a long decline for the Packers. Following their 1944 championship, the Packers finished 6\u20134 in 1945 and 6\u20135 in 1946. After the NFL established a uniform 12-game season in 1947, Green Bay won six games, lost five, and had one tie. In 1948, the Packers fell to 3\u20139, only the second losing season in franchise history and their first since 1933. The team bottomed out in 1949 with a record of 2-10, at the time the worst season in franchise history.\n\nIn 1946, Lambeau purchased [[Rockwood Lodge]], a former [[Norbertine]] retreat 17 miles north of Green Bay, and converted it into the first self-contained training facility in pro football history, complete with living and dining facilities for the players and their families. However, the players soon grew to detest the Lodge, primarily because the practice fields sat on top of brick-hard limestone. The players took such a severe beating during practice that Lambeau sometimes had to move practices back to fields near City Stadium. According to a 2013 article in ''[[ESPN The Magazine]],'' the team's rapid on-field decline was tied in part to the unforgiving fields at the Lodge, or \"the Rock\" as the players derisively called it. Additionally, Lambeau refused to abandon the [[Notre Dame Box]], a variation of the [[single-wing formation|single wing]], long after most teams switched to running the [[T formation]].<ref name=BlazeofGlory>{{cite journal |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9669836/mysterious-fire-1950-saved-green-bay-packers-espn-magazine |title=Blaze of Glory |last=Fleming |first=David |magazine=[[ESPN The Magazine]] |date=September 19, 2013 |accessdate=March 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207175756/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9669836/mysterious-fire-1950-saved-green-bay-packers-espn-magazine |archive-date=February 7, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe team's problems were not limited to the on-field product. The Lodge's upkeep, combined with declining revenues from City Stadium, caused severe financial problems. By 1949, they had gotten so severe that Lambeau largely handed the team to his assistants in order to devote his full attention to the team's balance sheet. Even slashing the payroll and his own salary were not enough to staunch the bleeding. The Packers only survived the season by staging an intrasquad scrimmage with retired players on Thanksgiving Day.<ref name=\"TURB\">{{Cite news | title = Rockwood Lodge had turbulent history | last = Hendricks | first = Martin | url = https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2016/08/18/rockwood-lodge-had-turbulent-existence/88904044/ | date = August 18, 2016 | access-date = March 8, 2019 | df = mdy | url-status = live | newspaper = [[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]] | archive-date = August 24, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160824012535/https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2016/08/18/rockwood-lodge-had-turbulent-existence/88904044/}}</ref>\n\nAll of this chilled Lambeau's already deteriorating relationship with the Packers management. After giving him a free hand for most of the last three decades, several team executives revolted at the exorbitant costs of buying and renovating Rockwood Lodge; some members of the financial committee almost resigned. Lambeau also rankled fans by spending most of his offseasons on \"recruiting trips\" far from Wisconsin. He arrived in Green Bay for the 1946 season sporting tailored suits, saddle shoes and a cigarette holder, leading fans to call him \"the Earl of Hollywood.\"<ref name=BlazeofGlory/>\n\nBy the end of the 1949 season, the Packers were on a seemingly irreversible slide toward bankruptcy. Rumors abounded that the league would use the impending merger with the [[All-America Football Conference]] as an excuse to force the Packers to either move or fold. Amid this, Lambeau tracked down four investors who were willing to pump $200,000 into the team\u2013provided that the franchise become privately held once again. This proposal was considered rank heresy in Green Bay. Many fans and executives believed NFL officials were pressuring Lambeau to move the team to the West Coast. In response, team president [[Emil R. Fischer]] tendered Lambeau a two-year contract extension that would have stripped Lambeau of all authority over non-football matters. Lambeau rejected the offer out of hand, effectively ending his tenure at the helm of the franchise that he founded.<ref name=BlazeofGlory/><ref name=\"TURB\"/>\n\nLambeau formally resigned on February 1, 1950,<ref name=clqtctc>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WOMpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZyMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5757%2C11134 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=Curly Lambeau quits to coach the Cardinals |date=February 1, 1950 |page=1, part 1 |access-date=November 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120134159/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WOMpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZyMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5757%2C11134 |archive-date=November 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nE9QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Yg0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7269%2C4720741 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Lambeau quits for Card job; Isbell seeks Packer post |date=February 2, 1950 |page=5, part 2 |access-date=November 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120133319/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nE9QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Yg0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7269%2C4720741 |archive-date=November 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> a little over a week after Rockwood Lodge burned to the ground. Rumors have long abounded that a Packers employee set the fire, though interviews with the family of caretaker Melvin Flagstad and other team officials of the time suggested it was caused by electrical problems. What is beyond dispute is that the $75,000 insurance payout helped pull the team from the financial brink.<ref name=BlazeofGlory/><ref name=\"TURB\"/> \n\nEven with the insurance money, the Packers were still struggling both on and off the field. A bond drive was issued in 1950, which raised $118,000 for the struggling team. [[Gene Ronzani]] replaced Lambeau as coach, and the team began using the green and gold colored uniforms that have been worn ever since. Green Bay won three games that season and in 1951. Ronzani's efforts to rebuild the team were severely hampered by the onset of the [[Korean War]]. However, led by a talented crop of rookies, the Packers got out to a 6\u20133 start in 1952 and were in playoff contention for most of the season. However, they closed they year with a three-game losing streak to end the season. A loss to Detroit in the final game left them in fourth place.<ref name=Guilbrandsen>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PpXQ19EQMzcC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=I+want+it+understood+that+I+am+in+complete+command+Lombardi&source=bl&ots=qUFl8BNpL4&sig=ACfU3U2VebI4nWJHITgeuXjDCk6GEaTXTw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjHz8Tm6-_mAhUEheAKHfs3AAgQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=I%20want%20it%20understood%20that%20I%20am%20in%20complete%20command%20Lombardi&f=false|title=Green Bay Packers: The Complete Illustrated History - Third Edition|author1=Don Guilbrandsen|publisher=[[Voyageur Press]]|date=2011|isbn=1616731486}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the issue of a new stadium began to crop up. City Stadium had long been known to be an extremely inadequate facility. The wooden stadium, adjacent to [[Green Bay East High School|East High School]], seated only 25,000 people and could not be expanded. The Packers had to use East High's locker room facilities, while the visiting team usually dressed at their hotel. Since the 1930s, the Packers had begun playing some home games in [[Milwaukee]]. By the time [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] opened in 1953, the Packers played two or three home games a year in Milwaukee.\n\nThe first game played at MCS was a 27\u20130 shutout at the hands of Cleveland, after which the Packers finished 1953 2-7-1. Ronzani was forced to resign with two games left in the season. [[Verne Llewellyn]] took over as GM in 1954 and [[Lisle Blackbourn]] of [[Marquette University]] was hired as head coach, but the Packers won four games that season. A 6\u20136 record in 1955 again put the team in postseason contention, but a loss to the Bears sent them home. The Packers fell back to 4\u20138 in 1956, a season most noteworthy for the drafting of [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]] QB [[Bart Starr]].\n\nBy then, the question of the Packers' staying in Green Bay was becoming acute. More and more opponents began asking for their games against the Packers to be played at County Stadium, which was almost double the size of City Stadium. League officials gave the Packers an ultimatum\u2013get a new stadium or move to Milwaukee full-time. Buoyed in part by a strong finish to the 1955 season, the people of Green Bay overwhelmingly passed a bond issue for a brand-new 32,000-seat stadium, naming it [[Lambeau Field|New City Stadium]]. The new stadium was dedicated in a game against the Chicago Bears. The Packers won the game, 21\u201317, but finished the season 3\u20139.<ref name=Guilbrandsen/>  \n\nBlackbourn was fired after the season and the coaching job was given to longtime assistant [[Ray McLean|Ray \"Scooter\" McLean]]. By this time, however, the once-proud franchise had become notorious as a dumping ground for players who either underperformed on the field or flouted team rules. Under the circumstances, the 1957 season was an unmitigated disaster. The Packers finished 1\u201310\u20131, the worst record in franchise history. McLean promptly resigned.<ref name=Guilbrandsen/>\n\nAmid growing concern inside and outside of Green Bay about the state of the team, the Packers then made what proved to be the most important hire in the history of the franchise, hiring [[Vince Lombardi]], the offensive coordinator of the dominating [[New York Giants]], as head coach and general manager. Lombardi demanded and got complete authority over football operations. Reinforcing the message, when he arrived in Green Bay, he told the executive committee, \"I want it understood that I am in complete command around here.\" The message applied to the players as well. Lombardi ran his first training camp as a harsh taskmaster, but the players quickly bought in, setting the stage for the decade to come.<ref name=Guilbrandsen/>\n\n==Lombardi era (1959-1967)==\n\nThe Packers of the 1960s were one of the most dominant NFL teams of all time. Coach [[Vince Lombardi]] took over a last-place team in 1959 and built it into a juggernaut, winning five league championships over a seven-year span culminating with victories in the first two [[Super Bowl]]s. During the Lombardi era, the Packers had a group of legendary stars: the offense was led by quarterback [[Bart Starr]], [[Jim Taylor (fullback)|Jim Taylor]], [[Carroll Dale]], [[Paul Hornung]], [[Forrest Gregg]], [[Fuzzy Thurston]] and [[Jerry Kramer]]; the defense was led by the likes of [[Willie Davis (defensive end)|Willie Davis]], [[Henry Jordan]], [[Willie Wood (American football)|Willie Wood]], [[Ray Nitschke]], [[Dave Robinson (American football)|Dave Robinson]], and [[Herb Adderley]].\n\nSeveral other factors helped the Packers return to success. After Pete Rozelle became NFL Commissioner in 1960, he made sure that every franchise got all its games broadcast on television, as up to that point only big-market teams like the Bears and Giants enjoyed this privilege. TV helped raise revenue for small-market teams like Green Bay, and also there was the introduction of [[revenue sharing]], which ensured that no NFL franchise would have to worry about bankruptcy.\n\nThe greatness of the Packers of the '60s really began [[1959 Green Bay Packers season|one year earlier]] with the hiring of Lombardi. In their first game under Lombardi on September 27, 1959, the Packers beat the heavily favored [[1959 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] 9\u20136 at Lambeau Field. The Packers got off to a 3&ndash;0 start before losing the next five, but then won their last four games to achieve their first winning season in 12 years since [[1947 Green Bay Packers season|1947]], ultimately finishing 7\u20135. A 21\u20130 shutout of Washington on November 22 was the last Packers game to date that did not sell out.\n\n[[1960 Green Bay Packers season|The next year in 1960]], the Packers, led by Paul Hornung's 176 points, finished 8-4 and won their first division title since 1944 during the height of World War II.  They also contested the NFL championship game for the first time since that year.  They won the NFL West Title and played in the [[1960 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship]] against the [[1960 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] at [[Franklin Field|Philadelphia]]. In a see-saw game the Packers trailed the Eagles by four points late in the game. The Packers began their final drive, aiming for glory, but it was not to be as [[Chuck Bednarik]] tackled Jim Taylor just nine yards short of the goal line as time ran out. Philadelphia won the championship, 17\u201313. In the locker room after the game, Lombardi told his men that this would be the last time the Packers would lose the championship game with him at the helm. That prediction became fact, as the Packers would never again lose the [[List of NFL champions (1920\u20131969)|NFL Championship Game]] under Lombardi.  This, in fact, would be Vince Lombardi's only postseason loss.\n\nAfter going 11-3 the [[1961 Green Bay Packers season|following season]] in the [[1961 NFL season|NFL's]] newly expanded 14-game schedule, the Packers again won their division and returned to the [[1961 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]], as they faced the [[1961 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], this time at New City Stadium. This time the game was no contest; the Packers exploded for 24 2nd quarter points as Paul Hornung, having recently returned from the [[United States Army|Army]], scored an NFL Championship record 19 points. The Packers shut out the Giants 37\u20130 to win their first championship since [[1944 NFL Championship Game|1944]] and their 7th total.\n\nNot resting on their 1961 Championship, the Packers stormed back in [[1962 Green Bay Packers season|1962]], jumping out to a 10&ndash;0 start en route to an amazing 13&ndash;1 season. This included a rematch with the Eagles in Franklin Field. Green Bay avenged the 1960 championship game by snuffing their opponent 49\u20130 in a game widely referred to as \"Lombardi's Revenge\". It would be the last Packers victory in Philadelphia until 2010. They reached the championship game again, this time in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. The Packers faced the [[1962 New York Giants season|Giants]] in a much more brutal [[1962 NFL Championship Game|championship game]] than the previous year, but the Packers prevailed on the surprising foot of Jerry Kramer and the determined running of Jim Taylor. They ground down the Giants 16&ndash;7 and Titletown U.S.A. reigned supreme.\n\nA three-peat eluded Green Bay in [[1963 Green Bay Packers season|1963]] as RB Paul Hornung was suspended by the league for betting on games. Without him, the team still finished 11-2-1, but was swept by the Bears, who won the division and ultimately the championship. The Packers were then forced into the embarrassing situation of having to go to Miami for the so-called \"Playoff Bowl\", an exhibition game the NFL held every January during 1960-69 between the second-place finishers of each conference. They beat Cleveland 40\u201323, but Vince Lombardi was not happy about it, calling the Playoff Bowl \"The Shit Bowl. A loser's game for losers. Because that's all second place is.\"\n\nThe Packers appeared to have run out of gas in [[1964 Green Bay Packers season|1964]], winning only eight games, losing five, and having one tie. Again they had to contest the meaningless Playoff Bowl in Miami, this time with the Cardinals, who won 24\u201317. Lombardi was again infuriated, calling it \"a rinky-dink game in a rinky-dink town between two rinky-dink teams.\"\n\n===1965 season===\nDuring the 1965 off-season, Curly Lambeau died and the Packers renamed New City Stadium Lambeau Field in his honor.  After a two-year absence from championship football, the [[1965 Green Bay Packers season|Pack]] was back in [[1965 NFL season|1965]]. The Packers rebounded by winning ten games and losing three.  They won some crucial games, including a 42&ndash;27 win over the [[1965 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]], a contest in which Paul Hornung (coming back from a betting scandal and injuries) scored five touchdowns. But, the season ender with San Francisco was a tie, forcing them to play the Colts at home in a playoff for the Western Conference title. A close defensive struggle, the game would be remembered for [[Don Chandler]]'s controversial field goal in which the ball possibly went wide right, but the official raised his arms to grant the three points. The two teams tied at 10-10 and went into overtime, where Green Bay won it on a 25-yard Chandler FG. The disputed win sent the Packers to the NFL Championship Game at home, where Hornung and Taylor ran through the [[1965 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]], helping the Packers defeat the Browns 23\u201312 to earn their 3rd NFL Championship under Lombardi.\n\n===1966 and 1967 seasons and first two Super Bowls===\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 15 - Willie Davis.jpg|right|thumb|The Packers and the Chiefs in the first AFL\u2013NFL Championship game. (Super Bowl I)]]\n[[1966 NFL season|1966]] would prove one of the most important years ever for both the Packers and the NFL as a whole. In 1959, Lamar Hunt and several others, frustrated at the league's lack of interest in expansion, began a rival organization, the American Football League. The AFL was initially laughed at by the NFL, but by 1965 were a serious competitor and began engaging in bidding wars for top college players. This culminated in the New York Jets offering Alabama QB Joe Namath a then unheard of $400,000 contract. During the spring of 1966, NFL and AFL heads met and agreed to an eventual merger into one big league, but only when the latter was deemed up to parity. Until then, the champions of both leagues would meet on a neutral site in January to determine the ultimate champion.\n\nThe Packers meanwhile had one of the [[1966 Green Bay Packers season|finest seasons in franchise history]], finishing 12-2 and with Bart Starr being named league MVP. They met the Eastern Conference winner [[1966 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the Cotton Bowl for the [[1966 NFL Championship Game|NFL championship]]. This celebrated game saw the Packers win 34\u201327. The Packers went on to defeat the AFL's [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 35\u201310 in [[Super Bowl I|the first ever Super Bowl]] (then called the AFL-NFL World Championship Game) at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum|L.A. Coliseum]]. Bart Starr was named the game's MVP.\n\n[[1967 Green Bay Packers season|1967]] marked Vince Lombardi's final triumph. The Packers team was visibly aging, and they finished 9-4-1. However, they still proved all-but-invincible at home as they beat the 11-1-2 [[1967 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] 28\u20137 in Milwaukee to again contest the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|league championship]] with [[1967 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]]. This game at Lambeau Field became known as the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|\"Ice Bowl\"]] due to the frigid weather conditions. But again, Green Bay prevailed with a score of 21\u201317.  The Packers now had to [[Super Bowl II|face the AFL champions]] (this time the [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]) in Miami's [[Orange Bowl]]. By this point, Lombardi and the team were much more confident of victory as they easily beat Oakland 33\u201314. Again, Starr was named the Super Bowl MVP.\n\nBy winning the 1967 NFL Championship Game, the Packers achieved a \"three-peat\" (three consecutive league championships) for only the second time in franchise history and the first time since they were named league champions following the 1929\u201331 seasons.  To this day, no other NFL team has matched or surpassed this record.  The Packers' back-to-back wins in the first two Super Bowls remains a Super Bowl record, and has since been tied seven times by six other franchises: the Miami Dolphins won Super Bowls VII and VIII following the 1972 and 1973 seasons, the Pittsburgh Steelers won Super Bowls IX and X following the 1974 and 1975 seasons as well as Super Bowls XIII and XIV following the 1978 and 1979 seasons and remain, to date, the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowl titles more than once, the San Francisco 49ers won Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV following the 1988 and 1989 seasons, the Dallas Cowboys won Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII following the 1992 and 1993 seasons, the Denver Broncos won Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII following the 1997 and 1998 seasons, and most recently, the New England Patriots won Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX following the 2003 and 2004 seasons.\n\nAfter the franchise's victory in [[Super Bowl II]], Vince Lombardi announced that he was stepping down as head coach, although he would retain the title of general manager. [[Phil Bengtson]] took his place.\n\n==The second \"Dark Ages\" (1968-1991)==\nPredictably, the [[1968 Green Bay Packers season|1968 season]] did not see an impressive performance from the Packers (6-7-1) as Bengtson proved unable to fill Lombardi's shoes and key players retired. Meanwhile, an exhausted Vince Lombardi announced his retirement from football altogether, and Phil Bengtson assumed the GM position. The Packers improved to 8\u20136 in [[1969 Green Bay Packers season|1969]], but players continued to retire.\n\nMeanwhile, Vince Lombardi had been seduced out of retirement by the Redskins, who made him HC and 50% owner of that team. He led them to a [[1969 Washington Redskins season|7-5-2 record in 1969]], thus preserving his streak of having never coached a team to a losing season. However, Lombardi fell ill with cancer during the 1970 off-season and died at the age of 57.\n\nThe newly merged NFL named the Super Bowl trophy in his honor, and the street in front of Lambeau Field was named Lombardi Avenue. Meanwhile, the Packers finished [[1970 Green Bay Packers season|1970]] 6\u20138, which included being shut out by Detroit twice. Dejected at his inability to match the standards of his illustrious predecessor, Phil Bengtson resigned as head coach. [[Dan Devine]] assumed the job and began the task of replacing the '60s players with fresh, young talent. Bart Starr himself was the last to go after starting in only four games during [[1971 Green Bay Packers season|1971]] in which he threw three interceptions, scored one rushing touchdown, and had 24 completions in 45 attempts. Most of the work in 1971 was done by newly drafted QB Scott Hunter, and at the close of the season, Starr retired at the age of 36.\n\nPoor drafting of players was a key reason for why the Packers had little success for almost a quarter of a century after Lombardi's departure.  To cite a few examples, in the first round of the [[1972 NFL Draft|1972 draft]], when future Hall of Fame running back [[Franco Harris]] was still available, the Packers instead chose mediocre quarterback [[Jerry Tagge]]. In [[1981 NFL Draft|1981]], when no fewer than three future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] defenders were still available -- [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Mike Singletary]], and [[Howie Long]], the Packers chose another mediocre quarterback, [[Rich Campbell (American football)|Rich Campbell]]. Finally, in [[1989 NFL Draft|1989]], when such future legends as [[Barry Sanders]], [[Deion Sanders]], and [[Derrick Thomas]] were available, the Packers chose offensive lineman [[Tony Mandarich]]. Though rated highly by nearly every professional scout at the time, Mandarich's performance failed to meet expectations.\n\nAlthough the Packers would not have winning success until [[1992 NFL season|1992]], there were moments when the Packers at times resembled the old Packer days of the 1960s. In [[1972 Green Bay Packers season|1972]], led by workhorse running backs [[John Brockington]] and new Packer [[MacArthur Lane]], and a sturdy defense that featured rookie [[Willie Buchanon]], the Packers captured the NFC Central Division Title with a 10&ndash;4 record. That team would lose in the playoffs to the [[1972 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] 16\u20133. In [[1975 Green Bay Packers season|1975]] under new head coach Bart Starr the Packers won only 4 games, but in one of those wins, the Packers beat the eventual 1975 NFC Champion [[1975 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 19&ndash;17 on October 19 in Dallas.\n\n[[1976 Green Bay Packers season|1976]] was another losing campaign, with the Packers only achieving a 5\u20139 record, the lowest in their division. The team dropped back to a 4\u201310 season in [[1977 Green Bay Packers season|1977]]. The frequent changes of quarterbacks during this period was indicative of Green Bay's troubles. When the NFL expanded the regular season to 16 games the following year, the team won six of its first seven matches, but largely due to an easy schedule. After the Packers began facing tougher opponents, the wins dried up and the final record for [[1978 Green Bay Packers season|1978]] was 8-7-1.\n\nThe Packers had another 1,000 yard rusher in [[Terdell Middleton]]: he rushed for 1,116 yards. In the early 1980s, the Packers had a star-studded aerial attack led by quarterback [[Lynn Dickey]] and wide receivers [[James Lofton]] and [[John Jefferson]].\n\nWhile the 1978 season had raised the morale of Packers fans, it did not last, for the team finished with a 5\u201311 record in [[1979 Green Bay Packers season|1979]], and a 5-10-1 showing during an injury-plagued [[1980 Green Bay Packers season|1980]] season. In [[1981 Green Bay Packers season|1981]], the Packers came close to the playoffs, but lost the final game of the season, a road match against the [[1980 New York Jets season|New York Jets]], and ended up with an 8\u20138 record.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 16 - Eddie Lee Ivery.jpg|thumb|right|The Packers only qualified for the playoffs twice ([[1971\u201372 NFL playoffs|1972]] and [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|1982]] [''pictured'']) during the team's post-Lombardi \"dark ages\" (1969-1991).]]\nAfter the [[1982 Green Bay Packers season|1982]] season was reduced to nine games by a players' strike, the NFL held a special playoff tournament with the eight best teams in each conference. The 5-3-1 Packers qualified for this, routing the [[1982 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season |Cardinals]] 41\u201316, but in the next round lost to the [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] 37\u201326. It would be their only playoff win during this rough stretch in the team's history. Another [[1983 Green Bay Packers season|8-8 season]] the following year led to the dismissal of Bart Starr as head coach. [[Forrest Gregg]] succeeded him, but after two more 8\u20138 seasons, he decided to cut several aging players and start over with fresh rookies. The rejuvenated Packers produced a 4\u201312 record in [[1986 Green Bay Packers season|1986]], as was typical of a rebuilding period.\n\nAnother strike affected the NFL in [[1987 Green Bay Packers season|1987]], resulting in a 15-game season. During the strike, the league used substitute players. The Packers fill-ins won one game and lost two before the regulars returned, but in the end the struggling team managed only a 5-9-1 record. Afterwards, Forrest Gregg resigned and was replaced by [[Lindy Infante]]. Still, the team continued to struggle, going 4\u201312 in [[1988 Green Bay Packers season|1988]].\n\nWith such a weak record, the Packers gained the privilege of first-round draft picks during the 1989 off-season. They selected Michigan State offensive tackle [[Tony Mandarich]], who was getting considerable publicity due to his huge 325-pound frame. Mandarich (who later admitted to using steroids in college) proved a poor choice in the end, and after three seasons of mediocre performance was cut. The [[1989 Green Bay Packers season|1989 campaign]] was the best in 17 years, with the Packers compiling a 10\u20136 record (including a victory over the eventual [[Super Bowl XXIV]] Champion [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]]), but still missing the playoffs. There followed another two losing seasons, with 6-10 and 4-12 records. A general overhaul took place during the 1992 off-season, with [[Mike Holmgren]] replacing Lindy Infante. Most importantly however, the Packers acquired second-year quarterback [[Brett Favre]] from the [[Atlanta Falcons]].\n\n==1992-1997: A new golden era==\n\nFavre would get off to a slow start, losing five of his first seven games, but afterwards won six in a row. The Packers finished [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|1992]] with a 9\u20137 record. In the [[1993 Green Bay Packers season|1993]] off-season, the team signed free-agent defensive end [[Reggie White]]. After another slow start, the Packers swept ahead for a 9\u20137 record, reaching the playoffs for the first time in eleven years. In the NFC wild card round, they faced the [[1993 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]], who had beaten them the previous week. In a close game, Favre led the team to a 28\u201324 victory, but in the divisional playoff round Green Bay was overwhelmed 27-17 by the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], the eventual Super Bowl winner. Brett Favre would also make the Pro Bowl following that season.\n\nThe [[1994 Green Bay Packers season|1994 season]] was a near-rerun of the previous year. Again the Packers went 9\u20137, beat the [[1994 Detroit Lions season|Lions]] 16\u201312 in the NFC wild card round, and lost the divisional game 35\u20139 to the [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]]. In [[1995 Green Bay Packers season|1995]], Favre continued to cement his reputation as one of the NFL's finest quarterbacks, passing for 4,413 yards and scoring 38 touchdown passes during the team's 11-5 regular season. The Packers reached the top of the NFC Central division for the first time since 1971. However, they still had to go through the wildcard round, overpowering [[1995 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]] 37\u201320. The divisional round saw them knock out the defending Super Bowl champion [[1995 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] 27\u201317, but they were again frustrated by the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]], who triumphed 38\u201327 in the NFC Championship game and went on to win another Super Bowl title.\n\nAs the [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|1996 season]] began, the Packers were more determined than ever to reach the Super Bowl. Beginning with an eight-game winning streak, they faced the hated [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] during Week 11 on a Monday Night game. The Packers suffered a smarting loss, the score being 21\u20136. After this, they won the last five regular season games, finishing with a record of 13\u20133. Reaching the top of the NFC Central division, they were able to skip the wild card round this time. In the divisional playoff, they easily defeated [[1996 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]] at Lambeau, with a score of 35\u201314. Meanwhile, the Cowboys had lost to the [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], and so the Packers would have to face this two-year-old expansion team in the NFC Championship match. The Packers beat them 30\u201313 to advance to Super Bowl XXXI.\n\n===Super Bowl XXXI===\n\nFacing Green Bay in the New Orleans Superdome in [[Super Bowl XXXI]] were the AFC champion [[1996 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. In a see-saw game, the Packers gained a 27\u201314 lead at halftime, which they never lost despite a valiant effort by their opponent. The final score was 35\u201321, and Green Bay had won its first championship since 1967.  Kick returner [[Desmond Howard]], who returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown late in the 3rd quarter, was named the game's MVP, becoming the first (and to date, only) Super Bowl MVP on the merits of special teams play.\n\nThe defending champions would have an easy go of the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|1997 season]], which saw a record of 13\u20133. Brett Favre passed for 3,867 yards and was named the league's MVP third year in a row. In their fifth consecutive playoff appearance, the Packers rolled over the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 21\u20137 in the divisional round, then beat the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] 23\u201310 in the NFC Championship to make the Super Bowl for the second year in a row.\n\n===Super Bowl XXXII===\n\nPlaying in San Diego's [[Qualcomm Stadium]] for [[Super Bowl XXXII]], the Packers would this time engage the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], who had lost in all their previous Super Bowl appearances. In a game that was even more see-saw than Super Bowl XXXI, Denver had taken the lead in the 4th quarter, with a score of 24\u201317.  Denver took its final lead with under 2 minutes in the game when head coach Mike Holmgren intentionally allowed [[Terrell Davis]] to score the go-ahead touchdown.  In the final minute of the game, Brett Favre threw a desperate pass at tight end [[Mark Chmura]], but it failed and the Broncos walked home with the Lombardi Trophy, ending a 13-year losing streak for the AFC in the Super Bowl.\n\n==1998-2005: Near Successes ==\n[[Image:Bubba Franks88-Edit.jpg|thumb|Former Packers' tight end [[Bubba Franks]], 2007]]\nStill playing strong football, the Packers compiled an 11\u20135 record in [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|1998]], but suffered several key injuries. They made the playoffs for the sixth year in a row, but this time as a wild card. Again, Green Bay faced its perennial foe the [[1998 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], but luck would not be on their side this time, as they lost a close game, 30\u201327, on a [[Terrell Owens]] touchdown catch with 3 seconds remaining.  Afterwards, Mike Holmgren stepped down as head coach and was succeeded by [[Ray Rhodes]]. The Packers only managed an 8-8 showing in [[1999 Green Bay Packers season|1999]] and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1992, despite a high-scoring season-ending performance against Arizona in an attempt to win a potential points-scored tiebreaker. Rhodes was quickly dumped and replaced by Mike Sherman.  In [[2000 Green Bay Packers season|2000]], the Packers finished 9\u20137, but again did not make the playoffs.\n\nGreen Bay rebounded nicely in [[2001 Green Bay Packers season|2001]], going 12-4 and returning to the playoffs as a wild card. Per established practice, they challenged the [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] and beat them 25\u201315, avenging their playoff loss three years earlier. There would be no Super Bowl appearance though, as Green Bay was crushed by the [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] in the divisional round 45\u201317. Favre threw a record six interceptions, three of which were returned for touchdowns. The [[2002 Green Bay Packers season|following year]] began strongly, with the Packers starting 8\u20131. Divisional realignment had placed them along with Minnesota, Chicago, and Detroit in the new NFC North. Being the only team in their division to achieve a record above .500 in 2002, the Packers seemed a virtual shoo-in for the first-round bye. However, they lost the final game of the season at the [[2002 New York Jets season|New York Jets]], which gave Green Bay the #3 NFC seed and forced them to go through the wild card round.  The playoffs would have a humiliating end as the Packers were routed 27-7 by the [[2002 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] on a snow-covered Lambeau Field for the franchise's first-ever home playoff loss.\n\n[[2003 Green Bay Packers season|2003]] began rather badly.  Lambeau Field had been renovated that year, but in the season opener, the Packers lost to the [[2003 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]] 30\u201325.  Brett Favre suffered several injuries during the season, and also had to deal with the death of his father on the eve of a Monday Night trip to Oakland.  However, Favre started, and put up an impressive performance as the Packers trounced the [[2003 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] 41\u20137. The Packers went into the final week needing to win and the Vikings to lose to win the NFC North in order to get the last playoff spot.  The Packers beat the [[2003 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] while the [[2003 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] rallied in the final seconds to beat the Vikings, giving the Packers the NFC North championship with an 11\u20135 record. The wild card round saw a fierce struggle with the [[2003 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], which tied 27-27 and went into overtime.  Defensive back Al Harris intercepted a pass from former Packer quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] and returned it 52 yards for a touchdown, giving the Packers the win. In the divisional round, the Packers lost to [[2003 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia]]. That game also went into overtime, tied 17-17, but Favre threw a pass up into the air that was intercepted by Eagles safety [[Brian Dawkins]]. Several plays later, the Eagles kicked a field goal and won 20\u201317.\n\nIn [[2004 Green Bay Packers season|2004]], Green Bay compiled a 10\u20136 season and reached the playoffs as a wildcard, but lost to the [[2004 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]] 31\u201317 in the first-ever playoff meeting between the two rivals.\n\nDuring the [[2005 Green Bay Packers season|2005]] off-season, the team drafted quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] from California. Rodgers was intended to be the eventual successor to Favre, now 36 years old and showing his age by turning in a poor performance that year. Despite a devastating 52\u20133 win over New Orleans in Week 5, Favre threw a career-high 29 interceptions. Injuries caused the team further problems, and the season ended with a 4\u201312 record, the worst since 1991. This season was notable for two bizarre incidents. The first was during the Week 8 game in Cincinnati where a fan ran out onto the field and grabbed the ball from Favre, and during Week 12 in Philadelphia where another fan ran out and scattered the ashes of his dead mother into the air.\n\nHead coach Mike Sherman was fired at the end of the 2005 season.\n\n==2006-present: Titletown Reborn==\n\n===2006 season===\n\nIt was widely expected that Brett Favre would retire in the [[2006 Green Bay Packers season|2006]] off-season, but he eventually decided to continue playing. In addition, the team hired a new coach, [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]]. The regular season started badly, with the Packers being shut out at home by the Bears. An uneven stretch followed, and again Green Bay would not reach the playoffs, going 8-8.\n\n===2007 season: Brett Favre's final season as starting quarterback===\n\n[[2007 Green Bay Packers season|2007]] witnessed a remarkable resurgence of the Packers.  They won their first four games, then fell to the Bears in Week 5.  Green Bay would go on to lose only two more regular season games: a loss to the [[2007 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], and a heavy 35\u20137 defeat at [[2007 Chicago Bears season|Chicago]]. With a 13\u20133 record, Green Bay emerged at the top of the NFC North and gained a first-round bye in the playoffs. In the divisional round, they rolled over the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] 42\u201320 in a snowy home game, then advanced to the NFC Championship. Also played at Lambeau, this game pitted Green Bay against the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. With below-zero temperatures, it was one of the coldest games in NFL history, and undoubtedly affected the 38-year-old Favre's performance. The game was tied 20\u201320 at the end of regulation and went into overtime.  After two failed attempts, combined with an interception by Favre, the Giants managed a field goal from [[Lawrence Tynes]], winning 23-20 and eventually going on to win [[Super Bowl XLII]].\n\n===2008 season: Beginning of Aaron Rodgers era===\n\nIn March [[2008 Green Bay Packers season|2008]], Favre announced his retirement, and as planned, Aaron Rodgers stepped up as starting quarterback. Before the team publicly declared Rodgers their quarterback of the future, however, the team asked Favre if he was certain about retirement. If not, he would be welcome to play another year as the face of their franchise. At the time he said he was comfortable with his decision and that he would not be returning to football. But as the summer approached, Favre suddenly decided that he wasn't ready to retire after all, and petitioned NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] for a comeback. Goodell granted his request, but the Packers were ready to begin anew with Rodgers and had no interest in taking Favre back. They went so far as to offer him $25 million to stay in retirement, but he rejected it. There followed a three-week war of words between Favre and the Packers management until he threatened to sign with the Minnesota Vikings. The thought of that caused Green Bay's front office to panic, and they decided that he could join the New York Jets in exchange for a conditional draft pick. Favre complied, signaling the end of his reign in Green Bay and the beginning of the Aaron Rodgers era.\n\nThe new quarterback got off to a slow start, winning his first two games as starter over Minnesota and Detroit, then losing the next three. Then Green Bay won two against the Seahawks and Colts, afterwards losing to the Titans and Vikings.  Aside from a 37\u20133 victory over Chicago, the rest of the season was one of losses, with a final 6\u201310 record. Green Bay closed the year on an upbeat note, winning 31\u201321 over Detroit on a clear, freezing day at Lambeau and giving the Lions an [[2008 Detroit Lions season|imperfect season]].\n\n===2009 season===\n\nIn August [[2009 Green Bay Packers season|2009]], Brett Favre, after his stint with the Jets, signed with [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]], provoking outrage among Packers fans. The regular season got off to a poor start, as the Packers were unable to defeat any opponents with a winning record. In Week 4, the team travelled to the Metrodome to face their former quarterback, losing 30\u201323. Following easy wins over Detroit and Cleveland, they hosted the Vikings in Week 8. Packers fans burned effigies of Favre, who was greeted by a chorus of boos and obscenities as he stepped onto Lambeau Field in the uniform of Green Bay's hated rival. Minnesota won the game handsomely, 38\u201326. The lowest point came a week later, when the Packers lost to the then-winless [[2009 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 38\u201328. After that, however, they recovered and swept through the next five games. Following a one-point loss to Pittsburgh, they defeated the Seahawks and Cardinals to secure a wild card spot in the playoffs.  This was the 16th time in the last 17 years that they had won their regular season finale. Having to face [[2009 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona]] again in the wild card round, the Packers waged a monumental struggle and managed to tie the game 45\u201345 at the end of the regulation, sending it into overtime. Two minutes in, the Cardinals scored a touchdown on a fumble return and ended Green Bay's playoff run. With a final score of 51\u201345, the game set a record for the highest-scoring playoff game in NFL history. Throughout the season, the Packers struggled with their offensive line, which was rated the worst in the league. Aaron Rodgers was sacked 50 times in the regular season ([[Matt Flynn]] was sacked once in relief of Rodgers) and hit 93 times. In the playoff game with Arizona, he took another five sacks and ten hits.\n\n===2010 season: Super Bowl XLV championship===\n\nGreen Bay's [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|2010]] off-season was mainly concentrated on improving their faulty offensive line. In the season opener, the Packers faced an Eagles team that was playing without quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] for the first time in a decade. However, the offensive line failed to deliver again as Rodgers took three sacks in the first half and also threw an interception. Meanwhile, Philadelphia's new quarterback, [[Kevin Kolb]], was pulled with a concussion and replaced by [[Michael Vick]]. After a while, the Packers' defense adjusted to him and Green Bay pulled off a 27\u201320 win, their first in Philadelphia since 1962. Second-year linebacker Clay Matthews (who knocked Kolb down) delivered an impressive{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2015}} performance in the game. After an easy{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2015}} win over Buffalo in Week 2, the Packers traveled to Chicago for a Monday Night matchup with their oldest rival. However, Green Bay exhibited very poor discipline and was plagued by numerous penalties, which had been a persistent problem ever since Mike McCarthy became head coach in 2006. The Packers lost the game 20\u201317. After this loss, the team returned home to face the 0-3 Lions in Week 4. They escaped with a 28\u201326 win, but it was an embarrassment{{Says who|date=August 2015}} to have given up that many points to a team that had not won in Green Bay since 1991 and which had won just two games over the last two seasons. The Packers' woes continued in Washington the next week. Clay Matthews ran Donovan McNabb down repeatedly in the first half of the game, but was then pulled with a hamstring sprain. This took most of the pressure off the Redskins' offense and the game tied at 13-13. Two minutes into overtime, Rodgers threw an interception and was knocked to the ground by Redskins defensive end Jeremy Jarmon with a concussion. Redskins kicker [[Graham Gano]] then booted a 33-yard field goal to win the game 16\u201313. Matthews and other key defensive players were missing from the Week 6 game at home versus Miami, leading to another overtime loss (23-20).\n\nIn Week 7, the injury-thinned team hosted [[2010 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] on Sunday Night. Again, Brett Favre was booed by the crowd at Lambeau, but the outcome would be different this time as Green Bay took advantage of their opponent's miscues (including three Favre interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown) to win 28\u201324. Following this emotional game, the Packers gained a surprise 9\u20130 win over the 6-1 New York Jets by kicking three field goals and shutting an opponent out on the road for the first time since 1991.\n\nIn Week 9, the Packers returned home for another Sunday Night game, this time with the struggling 1-7 [[2010 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]]. Green Bay quickly marched out to two touchdowns in the first quarter, en route to a 45-7 crushing of their opponent. Following their bye week, the Packers headed to Minnesota for a rematch with the Vikings, who virtually laid down in much the same manner as Dallas. Green Bay quickly buried them 31\u20133, causing their head coach, [[Brad Childress]], to be fired. It was the second consecutive game in which the team that lost to the Packers fired their head coach afterwards, as [[Wade Phillips]] had been fired by the Cowboys after their loss to the Packers.\n\nNext came a difficult road battle with the 8-2 [[2010 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], in which the Packers lost a close one 20\u201317. After routing San Francisco, the Packers headed to Detroit. What looked like an easy win proved anything but when Rodgers was knocked out with a concussion during a quarterback sneak and replaced by Matt Flynn. The latter was unable to get anything going as Green Bay lost a defensive struggle 7\u20133, falling to the Lions for the first time since 2005. Rodgers was then ruled out for the Week 15 game at New England.\n\nDespite dire predictions, the Packers marched out to an early lead and the game remained close throughout.  Flynn threw three touchdown passes, but in the end, [[Tom Brady]]'s greater experience prevailed as the [[2010 New England Patriots season|Patriots]] won 31\u201327. This game was nonetheless a turning point for the Packers, having been inspired by nearly beating the best team in the NFL when no one gave them a remote chance.\n\nWith an 8\u20136 record, the Packers needed to win their last two games to gain the #6 seed, the last seed, in the NFC playoffs. The Packers easily beat the New York Giants at home 45-17 and then hosted the rival Bears for the final game of the season. The Packers won the defensive struggle 10\u20133, sealing the Packers' playoff berth.\n\nIn the wild card round, the Packers had to travel to Philadelphia to play the hot [[2010 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]], led by Michael Vick. Rodgers threw for 3 touchdowns and rookie halfback [[James Starks]] had a 100+ yard running game.  [[Tramon Williams]] had an interception in the closing minutes sealing a Packer victory, 21\u201316.\n\nThe next game was against the Falcons in Atlanta.  Atlanta was the number-1 seed and was favored to beat Green Bay, but the Packers shocked the Atlanta fans by having a 28\u201314 lead at halftime, with Tramon Williams returning an interception for a touchdown in the final seconds of the first half. The Packers scored on the opening drive of the second half and the Falcons never recovered, as Green Bay rolled to a 48\u201321 win, sending the Packers to the NFC Championship game.\n\nThe NFC Championship game would be against the [[2010 Chicago Bears season|Bears]] in Chicago, in what was considered by almost everyone the biggest game ever in the Packers-Bears 90-year-old rivalry.  The game was only the second ever postseason meeting between the two storied rivals and the first playoff meeting between the teams since 1941, when they met in a one-game playoff for their division's championship, which the Bears won 33\u201314 in order to qualify for the [[1941 NFL Championship Game]], where they defeated the New York Giants.  The Packers scored on the opening drive on a touchdown run by Rodgers, and scored again in the second quarter on a run by Starks, giving the Packers a 14\u20130 lead at halftime. The defense was able to knock Bears starting quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] out of the game with a knee injury and soon after also knocked out back-up Todd Collins. In the fourth quarter, the Bears rallied with third-string quarterback [[Caleb Hanie]]. However, two key interceptions, one by defensive tackle [[B. J. Raji]] returned for a touchdown, and another by [[Sam Shields]] with less than a minute left, sealed the NFC championship for the Packers, who won 21\u201314.\n\nThe Packers played the [[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], who were seeking a record seventh Super Bowl title, in [[Super Bowl XLV]] at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in Arlington, Texas. The Packers struck first with two touchdowns near the end of the first quarter, one on a [[Jordy Nelson]] touchdown catch and the other on a [[Nick Collins]] interception return. Collins' touchdown marked the third consecutive playoff game in which the Packers returned an interception for a touchdown. The first half ended with the Packers leading 21\u201310, but they had lost both cornerback [[Charles Woodson]] and wide receiver [[Donald Driver]] to injury. The Steelers started to rally, but the Packers defense caused a key fumble on the first play of the fourth quarter and later stopped the Steelers on their final drive, winning their fourth Super Bowl and their record 13th overall NFL championship, 31\u201325. Aaron Rodgers was voted the game's MVP. With the win, the Packers joined the Steelers, 49ers and Cowboys as the only NFL teams to win at least four Super Bowls. They would eventually be joined by the New York Giants, who won their fourth Super Bowl ([[Super Bowl XLVI]]) following the 2011 season, and the New England Patriots, who won their fourth Super Bowl ([[Super Bowl XLIX]]) following the 2014 season.\n\n===2011 season: 15-1 regular season===\n\nDespite a lack of practices and training due to a lockout in the off-season, the Packers defeated New Orleans 42\u201334, hosting the first game of the [[2011 Green Bay Packers season|2011]] season. After a touch-and-go battle with Carolina in Week 2, the Packers came out on top 30\u201323. Week 3 saw the rematch with Chicago, in which Green Bay again prevailed 27\u201317 to get off to a 3\u20130 start. Green Bay breezed to another easy win over the Broncos to remain unbeaten at 4\u20130. The Packers became the only undefeated team in Week 5 when Detroit lost to San Francisco and they beat a winless Rams squad. The Packers then went on to win their next four in a row to end the first half of the season with a record of 8\u20130.\n\nIn week 12, the Giants posed to be their greatest challenge thus far. The Giants tied the game 35-35 late in the 4th quarter.  But in the last final minute, the Packers persevered and won the game on a [[Mason Crosby]] field goal. They continued their winning streak into the second half of the season, bringing them to 12-0 and assuring the Packers an appearance in the NFL's 2011 postseason.<ref>{{cite web|last=Associated Press|title=Rodgers engineers last-minute drive to overcome Giants, keep Packers unbeaten|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=311204019}}</ref>\n\nTalk of an undefeated season finally ended in Week 15 when the Packers lost in Kansas City. Returning home, they beat an injury-depleted Bears team and while resting their starters in Week 17, Matt Flynn carried Green Bay to a wild shootout victory over Detroit. With a 15-1 finish and the #1 playoff seed, the Packers completed the 2011 regular season with the best record in franchise history.  They were the sixth, and are the most recent, team to win at least 15 games in a regular season, equaled by the [[1984 San Francisco 49ers season|1984 San Francisco 49ers]], [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]], [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|1998 Minnesota Vikings]], and [[2004 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2004 Pittsburgh Steelers]], and bettered by only the [[2007 New England Patriots season|2007 New England Patriots]], who recorded a perfect 16-0 regular season.  As they were the #1 seed, the Packers received a first-round bye and home field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. After sitting out the wild-card round, Green Bay's post season came to an abrupt end in the divisional playoffs as the [[2011 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] (who went on to win [[Super Bowl XLVI]]) defeated them 37\u201320.\n\n===2012-2016: Playoff Struggles===\n\nIn 2012, the Packers went 11\u20135. They beat the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Wildcard round 24\u201310, and lost in the Divisional round 45\u201331 to the [[Super Bowl XLVII|eventual NFC champion]] San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIn 2013, the Packers went 8-7-1, losing to the San Francisco 49ers 20\u201323 in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nIn 2014, the Packers recorded their 700th victory against the Bears in week four.  The Packers are only the second team in NFL history to record 700 victories; the Bears were the first team to do it in 2010.  The team finished the regular season undefeated (8-0) in home games and 12-4 overall, and clinched the #2 seed in the NFC Playoffs.  After a first-round bye, they faced the Dallas Cowboys at home for the first time in the postseason since they won the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|\"Ice Bowl\"]].  There was a lot of hype in the week leading up to the game since during the regular season, the Packers had gone undefeated in home games while Dallas had gone undefeated in away games.  Green Bay defeated Dallas 26\u201321 to advance to the NFC Championship, where they faced the defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks.  After leading throughout most of regulation they lost 28\u201322 in a historic overtime rally by Seattle, who came up short in their bid for a second consecutive league title when they lost to the New England Patriots 28\u201324 in Super Bowl XLIX two weeks later.\n\nIn 2015, the Packers lost wide receiver [[Jordy Nelson]] to a torn ACL in the preseason. The Packers got off to a 6\u20130 start, but then went 1\u20134 to sit at 7-4 after Week 12. During Week 13 at Detroit, after trailing 20\u20130 in the second half, Aaron Rodgers threw a 61-yard Hail Mary pass to tight end [[Richard Rodgers]] with no time left on the clock to [[Miracle in Motown|win the game 27-23]] after a facemask penalty was called on Detroit as time expired. The Packers clinched their seventh consecutive playoff berth with a Week 15 win at the [[Oakland Raiders]], but lost the division title to the [[Minnesota Vikings|Vikings]] in Week 17. With a 10\u20136 record, the Packers secured the fifth seed in the playoffs. They beat the fourth-seeded [[Washington Redskins]] on the road 35-18 and traveled to face the second-seeded [[Arizona Cardinals]]. A similar play to what happened in Week 13 at Detroit occurred in the last 5 seconds when Aaron Rodgers threw a Hail Mary pass to wide receiver [[Jeff Janis]] to send the game to overtime. Unfortunately, the Packers' season ended when they lost to the Cardinals 26\u201320 in overtime.\n\nIn 2016, the Packers struggled throughout the first half of the season, sitting at 4-6 and on the verge of being eliminated from playoff contention. After their Week 10 loss at Washington, Aaron Rodgers said that the Packers could run the table and win their last six games. Despite widespread doubt of such a run, the Packers won their last six games of the season to finish the season with a 10\u20136 record and clinch the NFC North with a Week 17 win at Detroit. The Packers routed the fifth-seeded [[New York Giants]] 38\u201313 in the Wild Card round at Lambeau Field and upset the top-seeded [[Dallas Cowboys]] 34\u201331 at [[AT&T Stadium]] before falling to the second-seeded [[Atlanta Falcons]] 44\u201321 in the NFC Championship Game, which was the last NFL game ever played at the [[Georgia Dome]].\n\nIn 2017, the Packers started the season strong, going 4\u20131, until week 6, against the Minnesota Vikings. Early in the game, Aaron Rodgers was tackled hard by Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr, suffering a severe shoulder injury that would keep him out for the majority of the season. The Packers' offense struggled under backup quarterback Brett Hundley, losing 5 of their next 6 games, before getting back-to-back overtime victories over Tampa Bay and Cleveland. Aaron Rodgers returned for the next game, with the Packers at 7-6 and still in playoff contention. However, the Packers' attempt at a comeback against the Carolina Panthers fell short, with the Packers losing 31\u201324, eliminating them from the playoffs. Aaron Rodgers was benched for the last two games of the season, which were also Packers loses, causing the team to finish 7\u20139, their first losing season in 10 years. In the offseason, Ted Thompson, citing health issues, announced his resignation as general manager, and defensive coordinator Dom Capers was fired. Thompson was replaced with Brian Gutekunst, and Capers was replaced with Mike Pettine.\n\nThe 2018 season, which was the Packers' 100th season of existence, there was renewed hope in the Packers' rebounding, but the inconsistency with both the offense and defense caused the Packers to lose many close games, and also lose games against teams that, on paper, were supposedly worse than the Packers. The final straw came in a 20\u201317 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, which was the Cardinals' first-ever win at Lambeau Field, which also eliminated the Packers from the playoffs for the second season in a row. Head coach Mike McCarthy was promptly fired after the game, marking the first time ever the Packers had fired a coach during the regular season, and only the second time a head coach had left during the season (Gene Ronzani resigned in the middle of the 1953 season). Offensive coordinator Joe Philbin coached the Packers through the rest of the season, which finished with an even worse 6-9-1 mark.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{Green Bay Packers}}\n{{NFL team history}}\n\n[[Category:Green Bay Packers]]\n[[Category:National Football League history by team|Green Bay Packers]]\n", "name_user": "50.78.243.129", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFounding:I fixed the exact number and added a key detail)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Green_Bay_Packers"}

Produced using a combination of 2-D and 3-D models, it was the first of Zeman's productions to include actors in conjunction with stop-motion and special effects. It won awards at the International [[Film Festival]]s of [[Venice]] and [[Mannheim]].\n\nThe documentary-type nature of the film showing extinct animal species behaving naturally in their own environments was most unusual for its era and foreshadowed many later TV productions that would depict prehistoric life for educational rather than purely entertainment purposes. ''Cesta do prav\u011bku'' should not be confused with a dubbed and partly re-filmed US version of the film that was released in 1966 under the title ''Journey to the Beginning of Time''.\n\nThe film is, according to server Kinobox, the best Czech science fiction film of all time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=kinobox.cz|first1=team at|title=TOP 10: Nejlep\u0161\u00ed \u010desk\u00e1 sci-fi/fantasy v\u0161ech dob|url=http://www.kinobox.cz/clanek/3605-nejlepsi-ceska-sci-fifantasy-vsech-dob-cesta-do-praveku|website=Kinobox.cz|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref> The film was a great success abroad, especially in [[East Germany]], [[United States|USA]] and [[Japan]]. In [[New York City|New York]] alone, it was screened in 96 cinemas at a time. No Czech movie has managed to do this before or after. [[Steven Spielberg]] also mentioned the picture, saying that its quality is incredible given the time it was created. In his [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]], we can also see a very similar scene where examining the sick dinosaur was intended to get protagonists as close as possible to the lizard.<ref>{{cite news |title=MILN\u00cdKY TUZEMSK\u00c9HO SCI-FI: CESTA DO PRAV\u011aKU |url=http://vlcibouda.net/ruzne/693-miln%C3%ADky-tuzemsk%C3%A9ho-sci-fi-cesta-do-prav%C4%9Bku |publisher=Vlcibouda |language=Czech}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story involves four teenage friends who take a rowboat along a \"river of time\" that flows into a mysterious cave and emerges on the other side onto a strange, primeval landscape. The boy actors were Josef Luk\u00e1\u0161 (Petr, the main narrator), Petr Herrmann (Ton\u00edk, who also narrates in part), Zden\u011bk Hust\u00e1k (Jenda), and Vladim\u00edr Bejval (Jirka). As they make their way upstream, they realise that they are travelling progressively farther back in time, and face various perils as they do so (but learn much about prehistoric life in the process). The animals depicted in ''Cesta do prav\u011bku'' were never shown interacting with animals of other periods and it is assumed that different parts of the river represented distinct time periods. The plot is somewhat similar to that of the novel ''[[Plutonia (novel)|Plutonia]]'' (1915) by the Russian palaeontologist [[Vladimir Obruchev]], in which a team of Russian explorers [[hollow earth|enter the Earth's crust]] via an Arctic portal (a huge depression in the Earth surface created many millions of years previously by the impact of a giant asteroid, into which prehistoric animals had entered), and follow a river that leads them through a sequence of past geological eras and associated animal life. Some scenes in ''Cesta do prav\u011bku'' recall Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', with four male protagonists exploring a prehistoric world where they find evidence of native human habitation, are attacked by a group of enraged pterosaurs, witness a twilight fight between a carnivorous dinosaur and a herbivorous one, encounter a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' up-close, and see one of their members, Petr, nearly chased down by a ''[[Phorusrhacos]]''.\n\n==Prehistoric animals==\n*''[[Woolly mammoth]]''\n*''[[Megaloceros]]'' (antler only)\n*''[[Coelodonta]]''\n*''[[Deinotherium]]''\n*''[[Honanotherium]]''\n*''[[Smilodon]]''\n*''[[Uintatherium]]''\n*''[[Phorusrhacos]]''\n*''[[Pteranodon]]''\n*''[[Styracosaurus]]''\n*''[[Stegosaurus]]''\n*''[[Brontosaurus]]''\n*''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' (referred to as ''[[Trachodon]]'')\n*''[[Ceratosaurus]]''\n*''[[Meganeura]]''\n*Two unknown amphibians, though one is probably ''[[Eryops]]''\n*[[Trilobite]]\n\n==Production==\nZeman's use of unorthodox and seamless production techniques ensured that the film was free of jerky stop-motion sequences and grainy splicing of stop-motion with real-time footage that characterised Hollywood's animated films until the advent of computer-generated imagery.{{dubious|date=May 2012}}{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Filming took place on the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] river near [[Bzenec]] town in the [[Czech Republic]] at the nature reserve named (in Czech) [[Osypan\u00e9 b\u0159ehy]] and on studio sets.\n\nZeman was heavily influenced by the palaeo-art of the celebrated Czech artist [[Zden\u011bk Burian]] (1905-1981), and much of the film's imagery was inspired by Burian reconstructions that had been painted under the guidance of Czech palaeontologist [[Josef Augusta (paleontologist)|Josef Augusta]] (1903-1968). In some scenes, 2-D 'profile' images of animals originally depicted by Burian were filmed in real time (as in the ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' sequences), whilst other well-known Burian scenes were recreated in stop-motion using a combination of 2-D and 3-D models (as in the ''[[Deinotherium]]'' and ''[[Uintatherium]]'' sequences). Possibly for the sake of continuity, Zeman also used models or 2-D profiles when depicting extant species including bison, a python, flamingos, vultures, various antelopes, giraffes, and a jaguar (which was briefly spliced with footage of a real animal in one of only three instances of live species footage). In some scenes, miniature models of the actors and their boat/raft were also animated.\n\nIn addition to numerous miniature animal models and 2-D 'profiles', Zeman also used larger models of heads and bodies of animals (including a full-size 'dead' ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' and swimming woolly rhino, ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' and ''[[Trachodon]]'' models), as well as life-sized model plants (as in the [[Carboniferous]] forest sequence, and the encounter with the ''[[Styracosaurus]]''). The use of 2-D profiles and 3-D models animated by concealed means had the advantage of filming in real time without the need for labour-intensive stop-motion. Two of the film's prehistoric species were not based on Burian images; the ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' and the ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'' with which it fights in a twilight scene (it remains unclear as to why Zeman did not use Burian images in these instances).\n\n''Cesta do prav\u011bku'' was made on what would be considered a small budget by western film-makers. It discussed the various time epochs as defined by [[Palaeontology|palaeontologists]] and the types of animals typical of those periods, using information known in the 1950s. Whilst many animated feature films, particularly those in the US, used models of prehistoric animals in contrived sequences, Zeman instead depicted animals acting naturally in their own environments as if being filmed for a documentary, with the actors observing from the relative safety of the river. Such a philosophy was unusual at the time and was more typical of later TV productions that depicted prehistoric animals in an educational context (including the BBC's ''Walking with Dinosaurs'' and ''Walking with Beasts'' series) which became popular following the advent of computer-generated imagery that negated the need for time-consuming, highly skilled manual animation. The original release of Zeman's film was 93 minutes, although the East German release had a slightly shorter running time.\n\n==Marketing and retrospectives==\nIn 1966, another version of the film was released in the US by [[Bill Cayton|William Cayton]] whose company had been marketing Russian animated cartoons and feature films from the 1940s and 1950s, especially those of the famous [[Soyuzmultfilm]] studios (well known titles included ''The Firebird'', ''The Frog Prince'', ''Beauty & the Beast'', ''[[The Space Explorers]]'', and ''[[The Twelve Months (1956 film)|The Twelve Months]]''). The films were dubbed, sometimes re-titled, partitioned into chapters and distributed to US TV stations. In the case of ''Cesta do prav\u011bku'', Cayton replaced the opening and closing scenes of the original with new footage of American boys who entered the film in a dream sequence whilst visiting the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York. The film was copied to poor quality film stock and edited into short segments (about six minutes each) for presentation as a serial, syndicated to various children's television programs. The US version was released on VHS video by ''Goodtimes'' in 1994. Because of the new sequences, none of the actors' faces could be shown until the original footage began.\n\nIn April 2001 ''Cesta do prav\u011bku'' was screened at the ''Brooklyn Academy of Music'' in Brooklyn, New York, as part of the retrospective entitled ''The Fabulous World of Karel Zeman''. In 2010, it featured at the 50th ''Zl\u00edn Film Festival'' (May 30 - June 6) in the Czech Republic, one day of which (June 4) was dedicated to Karel Zeman to honour the centenary of his birth. The four original actors also attended the ceremonies (three from the Czech Republic and one - Vladim\u00edr Bejval - from the US).\n\nIn 2004 a DVD version of the film appeared in Japan, in Germany in 2005, and Spain in 2007. The Japanese and Spanish versions had different digital masters. The first German DVD had no digitally remastered images, but another German version with Czech and German dialogue, and 15 min of extras showing some of Zeman's filming techniques, was released in Jan 2010. This version used some modified sound effects for the dubbing, and the picture quality is below that of the original. Unfortunately the announced DVD of the original was held back for licence-juridical reasons and it remained unavailable commercially (as of April 2011) although copies of the original circulate amongst enthusiasts. In February 2020, [[The Criterion Collection]] included the film as part of their \"Three Fantastic Journeys by Karel Zeman\" box set.\n\nSeveral scenes of the film were used by the British ABC (Associated British Corporation) in the 1961 television serial ''Pathfinders to Venus''. The scenes were that of the Pteranodons flying overhead and the battle between the Ceratosaurus and the Stegosaurus.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of stop-motion films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0047930|title=Cesta do praveku}}\n\n{{Karel Zeman}}\n\n[[Category:1955 films]]\n[[Category:1950s fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1950s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Animated films set in prehistory]]\n[[Category:Czech films]]\n[[Category:Czech science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Czech adventure films]]\n[[Category:Czechoslovak films]]\n[[Category:Czechoslovak science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Czech-language films]]\n[[Category:Fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Karel Zeman]]\n[[Category:1950s stop-motion animated films]]\n[[Category:Films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Karel Zeman]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Journey to the Beginning of Time\n| image          = File:Journey to the Beginning of Time.jpg\n| caption        =\n| director       = [[Karel Zeman]]\n| producer       = William Cayton\n| writer         = J.A.

''Cesta do prav\u011bku'' should not be confused with a dubbed and partly re-filmed US version of the film that was released in 1966 under the title ''Journey to the Beginning of Time''.\n\nThe film is, according to server Kinobox, the best Czech science fiction film of all time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=kinobox.cz|first1=team at|title=TOP 10: Nejlep\u0161\u00ed \u010desk\u00e1 sci-fi/fantasy v\u0161ech dob|url=http://www.kinobox.cz/clanek/3605-nejlepsi-ceska-sci-fifantasy-vsech-dob-cesta-do-praveku|website=Kinobox.cz|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref> The film was a great success abroad, especially in [[East Germany]], [[United States|USA]] and [[Japan]]. In [[New York City|New York]] alone, it was screened in 96 cinemas at a time. No Czech movie has managed to do this before or after. [[Steven Spielberg]] also mentioned the picture, saying that its quality is incredible given the time it was created. In his [[Jurassic Park film)|Jurassic Park]], we can also see a very similar scene where examining the sick dinosaur was intended to get protagonists as close as possible to the lizard.<ref>{{cite news |title=MILN\u00cdKY TUZEMSK\u00c9HO SCI-FI: CESTA DO PRAV\u011aKU |url=http://vlcibouda.net/ruzne/693-miln%C3%ADky-tuzemsk%C3%A9ho-sci-fi-cesta-do-prav%C4%9Bku |publisher=Vlcibouda |language=Czech}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story involves four teenage friends who take a rowboat along a \"river of time\" that flows into a mysterious cave and emerges on the other side onto a strange, primeval landscape. The boy actors were Josef Luk\u00e1\u0161 (Petr, the main narrator), Petr Herrmann (Ton\u00edk, who also narrates in part), Zden\u011bk Hust\u00e1k (Jenda), and Vladim\u00edr Bejval (Jirka). As they make their way upstream, they realise that they are travelling progressively farther back in time, and face various perils as they do so (but learn much about prehistoric life in the process). The animals depicted in ''Cesta do prav\u011bku'' were never shown interacting with animals of other periods and it is assumed that different parts of the river represented distinct time periods. The plot is somewhat similar to that of the novel ''[[Plutonia (novel)|Plutonia]]'' (1915) by the Russian palaeontologist [[Vladimir Obruchev]], in which a team of Russian explorers [[hollow earth|enter the Earth's crust]] via an Arctic portal (a huge depression in the Earth surface created many millions of years previously by the impact of a giant asteroid, into which prehistoric animals had entered), and follow a river that leads them through a sequence of past geological eras and associated animal life. Some scenes in ''Cesta do prav\u011bku'' recall Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', with four male protagonists exploring a prehistoric world where they find evidence of native human habitation, are attacked by a group of enraged pterosaurs, witness a twilight fight between a carnivorous dinosaur and a herbivorous one, encounter a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' up-close, and see one of their members, Petr, nearly chased down by a ''[[Phorusrhacos]]''.\n\n==Prehistoric animals==\n*''[[Woolly mammoth]]''\n*''[[Megaloceros]]'' (antler only)\n*''[[Coelodonta]]''\n*''[[Deinotherium]]''\n*''[[Honanotherium]]''\n*''[[Smilodon]]''\n*''[[Uintatherium]]''\n*''[[Phorusrhacos]]''\n*''[[Pteranodon]]''\n*''[[Styracosaurus]]''\n*''[[Stegosaurus]]''\n*''[[Brontosaurus]]''\n*''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' (referred to as ''[[Trachodon]]'')\n*''[[Ceratosaurus]]''\n*''[[Meganeura]]''\n*Two unknown amphibians, though one is probably ''[[Eryops]]''\n*[[Trilobite]]\n\n==Production==\nZeman's use of unorthodox and seamless production techniques ensured that the film was free of jerky stop-motion sequences and grainy splicing of stop-motion with real-time footage that characterised Hollywood's animated films until the advent of computer-generated imagery.{{dubious|date=May 2012}}{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Filming took place on the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] river near [[Bzenec]] town in the [[Czech Republic]] at the nature reserve named (in Czech) [[Osypan\u00e9 b\u0159ehy]] and on studio sets.\n\nZeman was heavily influenced by the palaeo-art of the celebrated Czech artist [[Zden\u011bk Burian]] (1905-1981), and much of the film's imagery was inspired by Burian reconstructions that had been painted under the guidance of Czech palaeontologist [[Josef Augusta (paleontologist)|Josef Augusta]] (1903-1968). In some scenes, 2-D 'profile' images of animals originally depicted by Burian were filmed in real time (as in the ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' sequences), whilst other well-known Burian scenes were recreated in stop-motion using a combination of 2-D and 3-D models (as in the ''[[Deinotherium]]'' and ''[[Uintatherium]]'' sequences). Possibly for the sake of continuity, Zeman also used models or 2-D profiles when depicting extant species including bison, a python, flamingos, vultures, various antelopes, giraffes, and a jaguar (which was briefly spliced with footage of a real animal in one of only three instances of live species footage). In some scenes, miniature models of the actors and their boat/raft were also animated.\n\nIn addition to numerous miniature animal models and 2-D 'profiles', Zeman also used larger models of heads and bodies of animals (including a full-size 'dead' ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' and swimming woolly rhino, ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' and ''[[Trachodon]]'' models), as well as life-sized model plants (as in the [[Carboniferous]] forest sequence, and the encounter with the ''[[Styracosaurus]]''). The use of 2-D profiles and 3-D models animated by concealed means had the advantage of filming in real time without the need for labour-intensive stop-motion. Two of the film's prehistoric species were not based on Burian images; the ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' and the ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'' with which it fights in a twilight scene (it remains unclear as to why Zeman did not use Burian images in these instances).\n\n''Cesta do prav\u011bku'' was made on what would be considered a small budget by western film-makers. It discussed the various time epochs as defined by [[Palaeontology|palaeontologists]] and the types of animals typical of those periods, using information known in the 1950s. Whilst many animated feature films, particularly those in the US, used models of prehistoric animals in contrived sequences, Zeman instead depicted animals acting naturally in their own environments as if being filmed for a documentary, with the actors observing from the relative safety of the river. Such a philosophy was unusual at the time and was more typical of later TV productions that depicted prehistoric animals in an educational context (including the BBC's ''Walking with Dinosaurs'' and ''Walking with Beasts'' series) which became popular following the advent of computer-generated imagery that negated the need for time-consuming, highly skilled manual animation. The original release of Zeman's film was 93 minutes, although the East German release had a slightly shorter running time.\n\n==Marketing and retrospectives==\nIn 1966, another version of the film was released in the US by [[Bill Cayton|William Cayton]] whose company had been marketing Russian animated cartoons and feature films from the 1940s and 1950s, especially those of the famous [[Soyuzmultfilm]] studios (well known titles included ''The Firebird'', ''The Frog Prince'', ''Beauty & the Beast'', ''[[The Space Explorers]]'', and ''[[The Twelve Months (1956 film)|The Twelve Months]]''). The films were dubbed, sometimes re-titled, partitioned into chapters and distributed to US TV stations. In the case of ''Cesta do prav\u011bku'', Cayton replaced the opening and closing scenes of the original with new footage of American boys who entered the film in a dream sequence whilst visiting the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York. The film was copied to poor quality film stock and edited into short segments (about six minutes each) for presentation as a serial, syndicated to various children's television programs. The US version was released on VHS video by ''Goodtimes'' in 1994. Because of the new sequences, none of the actors' faces could be shown until the original footage began.\n\nIn April 2001 ''Cesta do prav\u011bku'' was screened at the ''Brooklyn Academy of Music'' in Brooklyn, New York, as part of the retrospective entitled ''The Fabulous World of Karel Zeman''. In 2010, it featured at the 50th ''Zl\u00edn Film Festival'' (May 30 - June 6) in the Czech Republic, one day of which (June 4) was dedicated to Karel Zeman to honour the centenary of his birth. The four original actors also attended the ceremonies (three from the Czech Republic and one - Vladim\u00edr Bejval - from the US).\n\nIn 2004 a DVD version of the film appeared in Japan, in Germany in 2005, and Spain in 2007. The Japanese and Spanish versions had different digital masters. The first German DVD had no digitally remastered images, but another German version with Czech and German dialogue, and 15 min of extras showing some of Zeman's filming techniques, was released in Jan 2010. This version used some modified sound effects for the dubbing, and the picture quality is below that of the original. Unfortunately the announced DVD of the original was held back for licence-juridical reasons and it remained unavailable commercially (as of April 2011) although copies of the original circulate amongst enthusiasts. In February 2020, [[The Criterion Collection]] included the film as part of their \"Three Fantastic Journeys by Karel Zeman\" box set.\n\nSeveral scenes of the film were used by the British ABC (Associated British Corporation) in the 1961 television serial ''Pathfinders to Venus''. The scenes were that of the Pteranodons flying overhead and the battle between the Ceratosaurus and the Stegosaurus.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of stop-motion films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0047930|title=Cesta do praveku}}\n\n{{Karel Zeman}}\n\n[[Category:1955 films]]\n[[Category:1950s fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1950s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Animated films set in prehistory]]\n[[Category:Czech films]]\n[[Category:Czech science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Czech adventure films]]\n[[Category:Czechoslovak films]]\n[[Category:Czechoslovak science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Czech-language films]]\n[[Category:Fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Karel Zeman]]\n[[Category:1950s stop-motion animated films]]\n[[Category:Films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Karel Zeman]]\n", "name_user": "TMProofreader", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_Beginning_of_Time"}

The integer ''n'' is called the \n[[order of magnitude]] and the real number ''m'' is called the ''[[significand]]'' or ''mantissa''.<ref name=\"Yadin2016\">{{Citation |title=Computer Systems Architecture |series=Chapman & Hall/CRC Textbooks in Computing |author-first=Aharon |author-last=Yadin |page=68\u221269 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |date=2016 |isbn=978-1482231069 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMDBDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA68 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122012329/https://books.google.com/books?id=yMDBDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA68 |archive-date=2016-11-22}}</ref> However, the term \"mantissa\" may cause confusion because it is the name of the [[fractional part]] of the [[common logarithm]].<!-- actually these are floating-point terms, not scientific notation --> If the number is negative then a minus sign precedes ''m'' (as in ordinary decimal notation). In [[#Normalized notation|normalized notation]], the exponent is chosen so that the [[absolute value]] (modulus) of the significand ''m'' is at least 1 but less than 10.\n\n[[Decimal floating point]] is a computer arithmetic system closely related to scientific notation.\n\n==Normalized notation==\n<!-- linked to -->\n{{main|Normalized number}}\nAny given real number can be written in the form {{gaps|''m''|e=''n''}} in many ways: for example, 350 can be written as {{val|3.5e2}} or {{val|35e1}} or {{val|350e0}}.<!-- \"any given number\" includes irrational numbers, which can't -->\n\nIn ''normalized'' scientific notation (called \"standard form\" in the UK), the exponent ''n'' is chosen so that the [[absolute value]] of ''m'' remains at least one but less than ten ({{nowrap begin}}1 \u2264 |''m''| < 10{{nowrap end}}). Thus 350 is written as {{val|3.5e2}}. This form allows easy comparison of numbers, as the exponent ''n'' gives the number's [[order of magnitude]]. It is the form that is required when using tables of [[common logarithm]]s. In normalized notation, the exponent ''n'' is negative for a number with absolute value between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.5 is written as {{val|5e-1}}). The 10 and exponent are often omitted when the exponent is 0.\n\nNormalized scientific form is the typical form of expression of large numbers in many fields, unless an unnormalized form, such as [[engineering notation]], is desired. Normalized scientific notation is often called '''[[exponentiation|exponential]] notation'''\u2014although the latter term is more general and also applies when ''m'' is not restricted to the range 1 to 10 (as in engineering notation for instance) and to [[base (exponentiation)|base]]s other than 10 (for example, {{gaps|3.15|base=2|e=20}}).\n\n==Engineering notation==\n{{Main|Engineering notation}}\nEngineering notation (often named \"ENG\" display mode on scientific calculators) differs from normalized scientific notation in that the exponent ''n'' is restricted to [[multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3. Consequently, the absolute value of ''m'' is in the range 1 \u2264 |''m''| < 1000, rather than 1 \u2264 |''m''| < 10. Though similar in concept, engineering notation is rarely called scientific notation. Engineering notation allows the numbers to explicitly match their corresponding [[SI prefixes]], which facilitates reading and oral communication. For example, {{val|12.5e-9|u=m}} can be read as \"twelve-point-five nanometres\" and written as {{val|12.5|u=nm}}, while its scientific notation equivalent {{val|1.25e-8|u=m}} would likely be read out as \"one-point-two-five times ten-to-the-negative-eight metres\".\n\n==Significant figures==\n{{Main|Significant figures}}\nA significant figure is a digit in a number that adds to its precision. This includes all nonzero numbers, zeroes between significant digits, and zeroes [[Significant figures#Identifying significant digits|indicated to be significant]].\nLeading and trailing zeroes are not significant because they exist only to show the scale of the number. Therefore, {{val|1230400}} usually has five significant figures: 1, 2, 3, 0, and 4; the final two zeroes serve only as placeholders and add no precision to the original number.\n\nWhen a number is converted into normalized scientific notation, it is scaled down to a number between 1 and 10. All of the significant digits remain, but the place holding zeroes are no longer required. Thus {{val|1230400}} would become {{val|1.2304e6}}. However, there is also the possibility that the number may be known to six or more significant figures, in which case the number would be shown as (for instance) {{val|1.23040e6}}. Thus, an additional advantage of scientific notation is that the number of significant figures is clearer.\n\n===Estimated final digit(s)===\nIt is customary in scientific measurements to record all the definitely known digits from the measurements, and to estimate at least one additional digit if there is any information at all available to enable the observer to make an estimate. The resulting number contains more information than it would without that extra digit(s), and it (or they) may be considered a significant digit because it conveys some information leading to greater precision in measurements and in aggregations of measurements (adding them or multiplying them together).\n\nAdditional information about precision can be conveyed through additional notations. It is often useful to know how exact the final digit(s) are. For instance, the accepted value of the unit of elementary charge can properly be expressed as {{val|1.6021766208e-19|(98)|ul=C}},<ref name=\"CUU_2014_e\">{{cite web |title=CODATA Value: Elementary charge ''e'' |work=[[CODATA 2014]]: The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty: Fundamental Physical Constants |publisher=[[NIST]] |date=2014-06-25 |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e |access-date=2017-06-25 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625091532/http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e |archive-date=2017-06-25}}</ref> which is shorthand for {{val|1.6021766208e-19|0.0000000098|u=C}}.\n\n==E notation==\n<!-- section title used as link target -->\n[[Image:Avogadro's number in e notation.jpg|thumb|upright|A calculator display showing the [[Avogadro constant]] in E notation]]\n\nMost [[calculator]]s and many [[computer program]]s present very large and very small results in scientific notation, typically invoked by a key labelled {{button|EXP}} (for ''exponent''), {{button|EEX}} (for ''enter exponent''), {{button|EE}}, {{button|EX}}, {{button|E}}, or {{button|\u00d710<sup>''x''</sup>}} depending on vendor and model. Because [[subscript and superscript|superscripted]] exponents like 10<sup>7</sup> cannot always be conveniently displayed, the letter ''E'' (or ''e'') is often used to represent \"times ten raised to the power of\" (which would be written as {{nowrap|\"\u00d7 10<sup>''n''</sup>\"}}) and is followed by the value of the exponent; in other words, for any two real numbers ''m'' and ''n'', the usage of \"''m''E''n''\" would indicate a value of ''m'' \u00d7 10<sup>''n''</sup>. In this usage the character ''e'' is not related to the [[e (mathematical constant)|mathematical constant ''e'']] or the [[exponential function]] ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> (a confusion that is unlikely if scientific notation is represented by a capital ''E''). Although the ''E'' stands for ''exponent'', the notation is usually referred to as ''(scientific) E notation'' rather than ''(scientific) exponential notation''.

I'm going to begin using it in place of \"[[exponent]]\" which is technically incorrect, and the letter D to separate the \"[[Mantissa (floating point number)|mantissa]]\" from the decapower for typewritten numbers, as Jim also suggests. For example, {{sic|<code>123|<sup>\u221245</sup></code>|expected=<code>123\u00d710<sup>\u221245</sup></code>}} which is displayed in scientific notation as <code>1.23 -43</code> will now be written <code>1.23D-43</code>.

(Instead, {{code|E}} denotes the [[e (mathematical constant)|mathematical constant ''e'']]).\n\n=={{Anchor|Dex}}Order of magnitude==<!-- The anchor tag is for the 'Decimal exponent' redirect -->\n{{Main|Order of magnitude}}\nScientific notation also enables simpler order-of-magnitude comparisons. A [[proton]]'s mass is {{val|0.0000000000000000000000000016726|u=kg}}. If written as {{val|1.6726e-27|u=kg}}, it is easier to compare this mass with that of an electron, given below.  The [[order of magnitude]] of the ratio of the masses can be obtained by comparing the exponents instead of the more [[error-prone]] task of counting the leading zeros.  In this case, \u221227 is larger than \u221231 and therefore the proton is roughly four orders of magnitude ({{val|10000|fmt=commas}} times) more massive than the electron.\n\nScientific notation also avoids misunderstandings due to regional differences in certain quantifiers, such as ''[[Long and short scales|billion]]'', which might indicate either 10<sup>9</sup> or 10<sup>12</sup>.\n\nIn physics and astrophysics, the number of orders of magnitude between two numbers is sometimes referred to as \"dex\", a contraction of \"decimal exponent\" (see f.e. [[Metallicity#Chemical abundance ratios|Chemical abundance ratios]]). For instance, if two numbers are within {{val|1|u=dex}} of each other, then the ratio of the larger to the smaller number is less than 10. Fractional values can be used, so if within {{val|0.5|u=dex}}, the ratio is less than 10<sup>0.5</sup>, and so on.\n\n==Use of spaces==\nIn normalized scientific notation, in E notation, and in engineering notation, the [[Space (punctuation)|space]] (which in [[typesetting]] may be represented by a normal width space or a [[thin space]]) that is allowed ''only'' before and after \"\u00d7\" or in front of \"E\" is sometimes omitted, though it is less common to do so before the alphabetical character.<ref>Samples of usage of terminology and variants: {{cite web |title=A Computer Program For The Design And Static Analysis Of Single-Point Sub-Surface Mooring Systems: NOYFB |series=WHOI Document Collection |author-first=Donald A. |author-last=Moller |date=June 1976 |type=Technica Report |publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution |id=WHOI-76-59 |location=Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA |url=http://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/665/1/WHOI-76-59.pdf |access-date=2015-08-19 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217135249/https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/665/1/WHOI-76-59.pdf |archive-date=2008-12-17}}, {{cite web |title= |url=http://www.brookscole.com/physics_d/templates/student_resources/003026961X_serway/review/expnot.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019061437/http://brookscole.com/physics_d/templates/student_resources/003026961X_serway/review/expnot.html |archive-date=2007-10-19}}, {{cite web |title= |url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/nsf/tutorial/ss/ssnot.html |access-date=2007-04-07 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404125922/http://www.brynmawr.edu/nsf/tutorial/ss/ssnot.html |archive-date=2007-04-04}}, {{cite web |title= |url=http://www.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/Units/sci_notation.html |access-date=2007-04-07 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225085247/http://www.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/Units/sci_notation.html |archive-date=2007-02-25}}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20061029195358/http://www.gnsphysics.com/mathreview.pdf], {{cite web |title= |url=http://www.ttinet.com/doc/language_v44_003.html#heading_3.2.4.2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503005623/http://www.ttinet.com/doc/language_v44_003.html |archive-date=2015-05-03}}</ref>\n\n==Further examples of scientific notation==\n* An [[electron]]'s mass is about {{val|0.000000000000000000000000000000910938356|u=kg}}.<ref name=\"CODATA2014Full\">{{cite journal |author-last1=Mohr |author-first1=Peter J. |author-last2=Newell |author-first2=David B. |author-last3=Taylor |author-first3=Barry N. |date=July\u2013September 2016 |title=CODATA recommended values of the fundamental physical constants: 2014 |url=http://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=920687 |journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] |volume=88 |issue=3 |page=035009 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.88.035009 |arxiv=1507.07956 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170123205803/http://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=920687 |archive-date=2017-01-23 |bibcode=2016RvMP...88c5009M |citeseerx=10.1.1.150.1225}}</ref> In scientific notation, this is written {{val|9.10938356e-31|u=kg}} (in SI units).\n* The [[Earth]]'s [[mass]] is about {{val|5972400000000000000000000|u=kg}}.<ref>{{cite journal |author-last1=Luzum |first1=Brian |author-last2=Capitaine |author-first2=Nicole |author-last3=Fienga |author-first3=Agn\u00e8s |author-last4=Folkner |author-first4=William |author-last5=Fukushima |author-first5=Toshio |author-last6=Hilton |author-first6=James |author-last7=Hohenkerk |author-first7=Catherine |author-last8=Krasinsky |author-first8=George |author-last9=Petit |author-first9=G\u00e9rard |author-last10=Pitjeva |author-first10=Elena |author-last11=Soffel |author-first11=Michael |author-last12=Wallace |author-first12=Patrick |title=The IAU 2009 system of astronomical constants: The report of the IAU working group on numerical standards for Fundamental Astronomy |journal=Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy |volume=110 |issue=4 |date=August 2011 |pages=293\u2013304 |bibcode=2011CeMDA.110..293L |doi=10.1007/s10569-011-9352-4|doi-access=free }}</ref> In scientific notation, this is written {{val|5.9724e24|u=kg}}.\n* The [[Earth#Shape|Earth's circumference]] is approximately {{val|40000000|u=m}}.<ref>{{cite book |author=Various |editor-first=David R. |editor-last=Lide |date=2000 |title=Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition=81st |publisher=CRC |isbn=978-0-8493-0481-1}}</ref> In scientific notation, this is {{val|4e7|u=m}}.

Quoting a value of {{val|25.400|u=mm}} shows that the value is correct to the nearest micrometre. An approximated value with only two significant digits would be {{val|2.5e1|u=mm}} instead. As there is no limit to the number of significant digits, the length of an inch could, if required, be written as (say) {{val|2.54000000000e1|u=mm}} instead.\n\n==Converting numbers==\nConverting a number in these cases means to either convert the number into scientific notation form, convert it back into decimal form or to change the exponent part of the equation. None of these alter the actual number, only how it's expressed.\n\n===Decimal to scientific===\nFirst, move the decimal separator point sufficient places, ''n'', to put the number's value within a desired range, between 1 and 10 for normalized notation. If the decimal was moved to the left, append <code class=nowarp>\u00d7 10''<sup>n</sup>''</code>; to the right, <code class=nowarp>\u00d7 10''<sup>\u2212n</sup>''</code>. To represent the number {{val|1230400|fmt=commas}} in normalized scientific notation, the decimal separator would be moved 6 digits to the left and <code class=nowrap>\u00d7 10<sup>6</sup></code> appended, resulting in {{val|1.2304e6}}.

In [[#Normalized notation|normalized notation]], the exponent is chosen so that the [[absolute value]] (modulus) of the significand ''m'' is at least 1 but less than 10.\n\n[[Decimal floating point]] is a computer arithmetic system closely related to scientific notation.\n\n==Normalized notation==\n<!-- linked to -->\n{{main|Normalized number}}\nAny given real number can be written in the form {{gaps|''m''|e=''n''}} in many ways: for example, 350 can be written as {{val|3.5e2}} or {{val|35e1}} or {{val|350e0}}.<!-- \"any given number\" includes irrational numbers, which can't -->\n\nIn ''normalized'' scientific notation (called \"standard form\" in the UK), the exponent ''n'' is chosen so that the [[absolute value]] of ''m'' remains at least one but less than ten ({{nowrap begin}}1 \u2264 |''m''| < 10{{nowrap end}}). Thus 350 is written as {{val|3.5e2}}. This form allows easy comparison of numbers, as the exponent ''n'' gives the number's [[order of magnitude]]. It is the form that is required when using tables of [[common logarithm]]s. In normalized notation, the exponent ''n'' is negative for a number with absolute value between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.5 is written as {{val|5e-1}}). The 10 and exponent are often omitted when the exponent is 0.\n\nNormalized scientific form is the typical form of expression of large numbers in many fields, unless an unnormalized form, such as [[engineering notation]], is desired. Normalized scientific notation is often called '''[[exponentiation|exponential]] notation'''\u2014although the latter term is more general and also applies when ''m'' is not restricted to the range 1 to 10 (as in engineering notation for instance) and to [[base (exponentiation)|base]]s other than 10 (for example, {{gaps|3.15|base=2|e=20}}).\n\n==Engineering notation==\n{{Main|Engineering notation}}\nEngineering notation (often named \"ENG\" display mode on scientific calculators) differs from normalized scientific notation in that the exponent ''n'' is restricted to [[multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3. Consequently, the absolute value of ''m'' is in the range 1 \u2264 |''m''| < 1000, rather than 1 \u2264 |''m''| < 10. Though similar in concept, engineering notation is rarely called scientific notation. Engineering notation allows the numbers to explicitly match their corresponding [[SI prefixes]], which facilitates reading and oral communication. For example, {{val|12.5e-9|u=m}} can be read as \"twelve-point-five nanometres\" and written as {{val|12.5|u=nm}}, while its scientific notation equivalent {{val|1.25e-8|u=m}} would likely be read out as \"one-point-two-five times ten-to-the-negative-eight metres\".\n\n==Significant figures==\n{{Main|Significant figures}}\nA significant figure is a digit in a number that adds to its precision. This includes all nonzero numbers, zeroes between significant digits, and zeroes [[Significant figures#Identifying significant digits|indicated to be significant]].\nLeading and trailing zeroes are not significant because they exist only to show the scale of the number. Therefore, {{val|1230400}} usually has five significant figures: 1, 2, 3, 0, and 4; the final two zeroes serve only as placeholders and add no precision to the original number.\n\nWhen a number is converted into normalized scientific notation, it is scaled down to a number between 1 and 10. All of the significant digits remain, but the place holding zeroes are no longer required. Thus {{val|1230400}} would become {{val|1.2304e6}}. However, there is also the possibility that the number may be known to six or more significant figures, in which case the number would be shown as (for instance) {{val|1.23040e6}}. Thus, an additional advantage of scientific notation is that the number of significant figures is clearer.\n\n===Estimated final digit(s)===\nIt is customary in scientific measurements to record all the definitely known digits from the measurements, and to estimate at least one additional digit if there is any information at all available to enable the observer to make an estimate. The resulting number contains more information than it would without that extra digit(s), and it (or they) may be considered a significant digit because it conveys some information leading to greater precision in measurements and in aggregations of measurements (adding them or multiplying them together).\n\nAdditional information about precision can be conveyed through additional notations. It is often useful to know how exact the final digit(s) are. For instance, the accepted value of the unit of elementary charge can properly be expressed as {{val|1.6021766208e-19|(98)|ul=C}},<ref name=\"CUU_2014_e\">{{cite web |title=CODATA Value: Elementary charge ''e'' |work=[[CODATA 2014]]: The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty: Fundamental Physical Constants |publisher=[[NIST]] |date=2014-06-25 |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e |access-date=2017-06-25 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625091532/http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e |archive-date=2017-06-25}}</ref> which is shorthand for {{val|1.6021766208e-19|0.0000000098|u=C}}.\n\n==E notation==\n<!-- section title used as link target -->\n[[Image:Avogadro's number in e notation.jpg|thumb|upright|A calculator display showing the [[Avogadro constant]] in E notation]]\n\nMost [[calculator]]s and many [[computer program]]s present very large and very small results in scientific notation, typically invoked by a key labelled {{button|EXP}} (for ''exponent''), {{button|EEX}} (for ''enter exponent''), {{button|EE}}, {{button|EX}}, {{button|E}}, or {{button|\u00d710<sup>''x''</sup>}} depending on vendor and model. Because [[subscript and superscript|superscripted]] exponents like 10<sup>7</sup> cannot always be conveniently displayed, the letter ''E'' (or ''e'') is often used to represent \"times ten raised to the power of\" (which would be written as {{nowrap|\"\u00d7 10<sup>''n''</sup>\"}}) and is followed by the value of the exponent; in other words, for any two real numbers ''m'' and ''n'', the usage of \"''m''E''n''\" would indicate a value of ''m'' \u00d7 10<sup>''n''</sup>. In this usage the character ''e'' is not related to the [[e (mathematical constant)|mathematical constant ''e'']] or the [[exponential function]] ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> (a confusion that is unlikely if scientific notation is represented by a capital ''E''). Although the ''E'' stands for ''exponent'', the notation is usually referred to as ''(scientific) E notation'' rather than ''(scientific) exponential notation''. The use of E notation facilitates data entry and readability in textual communication since it minimizes keystrokes, avoids reduced font sizes and provides a simpler and more concise display, but it is not encouraged in some publications.<ref>{{Citation |author-last=Edwards |author-first=John |date=2009 |title=Submission Guidelines for Authors: HPS 2010 Midyear Proceedings |publisher=Health Physics Society |location=[[McLean, Virginia]] |page=5 |url=http://hps.org/documents/2010_midyear_author-submission-guidelines.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=2013-03-30 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515112227/http://hps.org/documents/2010_midyear_author-submission-guidelines.pdf |archive-date=2013-05-15}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Decapower|D notation}}Examples and other notations ===\n* In most popular programming languages, {{code|6.022E23}} (or {{code|6.022e23}}) is equivalent to [[Avogadro constant|{{val|6.022e23}}]], and [[Planck length|{{val|1.6e-35}}]] would be written {{code|1.6E-35}} (e.g. [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Analytica (software)|Analytica]], [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]], [[FORTRAN]] (since [[FORTRAN II]] as of 1958), [[MATLAB]], [[Scilab]], [[Perl]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html |title=Primitive Data Types (The Java Tutorials > Learning the Java Language > Language Basics) |publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]] |access-date=2012-03-06 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117041930/http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html |archive-date=2011-11-17}}</ref> [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[JavaScript]], and others).\n* After the introduction of the first [[pocket calculator]]s supporting scientific notation in 1972 ([[HP-35]], [[TI SR-10|SR-10]]) the term ''decapower'' was sometimes used in the emerging user communities for the power-of-ten multiplier in order to better distinguish it from \"normal\" exponents.

I'm going to begin using it in place of \"[[exponent]]\" which is technically incorrect, and the letter D to separate the \"[[Mantissa (floating point number)|mantissa]]\" from the decapower for typewritten numbers, as Jim also suggests.

(Instead, {{code|E}} denotes the [[e (mathematical constant)|mathematical constant ''e'']]).\n\n=={{Anchor|Dex}}Order of magnitude==<!-- The anchor tag is for the 'Decimal exponent' redirect -->\n{{Main|Order of magnitude}}\nScientific notation also enables simpler order-of-magnitude comparisons. A [[proton]]'s mass is {{val|0.0000000000000000000000000016726|u=kg}}. If written as {{val|1.6726e-27|u=kg}}, it is easier to compare this mass with that of an electron, given below.  The [[order of magnitude]] of the ratio of the masses can be obtained by comparing the exponents instead of the more [[error-prone]] task of counting the leading zeros.  In this case, \u221227 is larger than \u221231 and therefore the proton is roughly four orders of magnitude ({{val|10000|fmt=commas}} times) more massive than the electron.\n\nScientific notation also avoids misunderstandings due to regional differences in certain quantifiers, such as ''[[Long and short scales|billion]]'', which might indicate either 10<sup>9</sup> or 10<sup>12</sup>.\n\nIn physics and astrophysics, the number of orders of magnitude between two numbers is sometimes referred to as \"dex\", a contraction of \"decimal exponent\" (see f.e. [[Metallicity#Chemical abundance ratios|Chemical abundance ratios]]). For instance, if two numbers are within {{val|1|u=dex}} of each other, then the ratio of the larger to the smaller number is less than 10. Fractional values can be used, so if within {{val|0.5|u=dex}}, the ratio is less than 10<sup>0.5</sup>, and so on.\n\n==Use of spaces==\nIn normalized scientific notation, in E notation, and in engineering notation, the [[Space (punctuation)|space]] (which in [[typesetting]] may be represented by a normal width space or a [[thin space]]) that is allowed ''only'' before and after \"\u00d7\" or in front of \"E\" is sometimes omitted, though it is less common to do so before the alphabetical character.<ref>Samples of usage of terminology and variants: {{cite web |title=A Computer Program For The Design And Static Analysis Of Single-Point Sub-Surface Mooring Systems: NOYFB |series=WHOI Document Collection |author-first=Donald A. |author-last=Moller |date=June 1976 |type=Technica Report |publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution |id=WHOI-76-59 |location=Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA |url=http://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/665/1/WHOI-76-59.pdf |access-date=2015-08-19 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217135249/https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/665/1/WHOI-76-59.pdf |archive-date=2008-12-17}}, {{cite web |title= |url=http://www.brookscole.com/physics_d/templates/student_resources/003026961X_serway/review/expnot.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019061437/http://brookscole.com/physics_d/templates/student_resources/003026961X_serway/review/expnot.html |archive-date=2007-10-19}}, {{cite web |title= |url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/nsf/tutorial/ss/ssnot.html |access-date=2007-04-07 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404125922/http://www.brynmawr.edu/nsf/tutorial/ss/ssnot.html |archive-date=2007-04-04}}, {{cite web |title= |url=http://www.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/Units/sci_notation.html |access-date=2007-04-07 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225085247/http://www.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/Units/sci_notation.html |archive-date=2007-02-25}}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20061029195358/http://www.gnsphysics.com/mathreview.pdf], {{cite web |title= |url=http://www.ttinet.com/doc/language_v44_003.html#heading_3.2.4.2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503005623/http://www.ttinet.com/doc/language_v44_003.html |archive-date=2015-05-03}}</ref>\n\n==Further examples of scientific notation==\n* An [[electron]]'s mass is about {{val|0.000000000000000000000000000000910938356|u=kg}}.<ref name=\"CODATA2014Full\">{{cite journal |author-last1=Mohr |author-first1=Peter J. |author-last2=Newell |author-first2=David B. |author-last3=Taylor |author-first3=Barry N. |date=July\u2013September 2016 |title=CODATA recommended values of the fundamental physical constants: 2014 |url=http://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=920687 |journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] |volume=88 |issue=3 |page=035009 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.88.035009 |arxiv=1507.07956 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170123205803/http://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=920687 |archive-date=2017-01-23 |bibcode=2016RvMP...88c5009M |citeseerx=10.1.1.150.1225}}</ref> In scientific notation, this is written {{val|9.10938356e-31|u=kg}} (in SI units).\n* The [[Earth]]'s [[mass]] is about {{val|5972400000000000000000000|u=kg}}.<ref>{{cite journal |author-last1=Luzum |first1=Brian |author-last2=Capitaine |author-first2=Nicole |author-last3=Fienga |author-first3=Agn\u00e8s |author-last4=Folkner |author-first4=William |author-last5=Fukushima |author-first5=Toshio |author-last6=Hilton |author-first6=James |author-last7=Hohenkerk |author-first7=Catherine |author-last8=Krasinsky |author-first8=George |author-last9=Petit |author-first9=G\u00e9rard |author-last10=Pitjeva |author-first10=Elena |author-last11=Soffel |author-first11=Michael |author-last12=Wallace |author-first12=Patrick |title=The IAU 2009 system of astronomical constants: The report of the IAU working group on numerical standards for Fundamental Astronomy |journal=Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy |volume=110 |issue=4 |date=August 2011 |pages=293\u2013304 |bibcode=2011CeMDA.110..293L |doi=10.1007/s10569-011-9352-4|doi-access=free }}</ref> In scientific notation, this is written {{val|5.9724e24|u=kg}}.\n* The [[Earth#Shape|Earth's circumference]] is approximately {{val|40000000|u=m}}.<ref>{{cite book |author=Various |editor-first=David R. |editor-last=Lide |date=2000 |title=Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition=81st |publisher=CRC |isbn=978-0-8493-0481-1}}</ref> In scientific notation, this is {{val|4e7|u=m}}.

Quoting a value of {{val|25.400|u=mm}} shows that the value is correct to the nearest micrometre. An approximated value with only two significant digits would be {{val|2.5e1|u=mm}} instead. As there is no limit to the number of significant digits, the length of an inch could, if required, be written as (say) {{val|2.54000000000e1|u=mm}} instead.\n\n==Converting numbers==\nConverting a number in these cases means to either convert the number into scientific notation form, convert it back into decimal form or to change the exponent part of the equation. None of these alter the actual number, only how it's expressed.\n\n===Decimal to scientific===\nFirst, move the decimal separator point sufficient places, ''n'', to put the number's value within a desired range, between 1 and 10 for normalized notation. If the decimal was moved to the left, append <code class=nowarp>\u00d7 10''<sup>n</sup>''</code>; to the right, <code class=nowarp>\u00d7 10''<sup>\u2212n</sup>''</code>. To represent the number {{val|1230400|fmt=commas}} in normalized scientific notation, the decimal separator would be moved 6 digits to the left and <code class=nowrap>\u00d7 10<sup>6</sup></code> appended, resulting in {{val|1.2304e6}}. The number {{val|-0.0040321}} would have its decimal separator shifted 3 digits to the right instead of the left and yield {{val|-4.0321e-3}} as a result.\n\n===Scientific to decimal===\nConverting a number from scientific notation to decimal notation, first remove the <code class=nowrap>\u00d7 10''<sup>n</sup>''</code> on the end, then shift the decimal separator ''n'' digits to the right (positive ''n'') or left (negative ''n''). The number {{val|1.2304e6}} would have its decimal separator shifted 6 digits to the right and become {{val|1230400|fmt=commas}}, while {{val|-4.0321e-3}} would have its decimal separator moved 3 digits to the left and be {{val|-0.0040321}}.\n\n=== Exponential===\nConversion between different scientific notation representations of the same number with different exponential values is achieved by performing opposite operations of multiplication or division by a power of ten on the significand and an subtraction or addition of one on the exponent part. The decimal separator in the significand is shifted ''x'' places to the left (or right) and ''x'' is added to (or subtracted from) the exponent, as shown below.\n\n: {{val|1.234e3}} = {{val|12.34e2}} = {{val|123.4e1}} = 1234\n\n==Basic operations==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Addition]] -->\nGiven two numbers in scientific notation,\n\n:<math>x_0=m_0\\times10^{n_0}</math>\nand\n:<math>x_1=m_1\\times10^{n_1}</math>\n\n[[Multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] are performed using the rules for operation with [[exponentiation]]:\n\n:<math>x_0 x_1=m_0 m_1\\times10^{n_0+n_1}</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac{x_0}{x_1}=\\frac{m_0}{m_1}\\times10^{n_0-n_1}</math>\n\nSome examples are:\n:<math>5.67\\times10^{-5} \\times 2.34\\times10^2 \\approx 13.3\\times10^{-5+2} = 13.3\\times10^{-3} = 1.33\\times10^{-2}</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac{2.34\\times10^2}{5.67\\times10^{-5}}  \\approx 0.413\\times10^{2-(-5)} = 0.413\\times10^{7} = 4.13\\times10^6</math>\n\n[[Addition]] and [[subtraction]] require the numbers to be represented using the same exponential part, so that the significand can be simply added or subtracted:\n\n:<math>x_0 = m_0 \\times10^{n_0}</math> and <math>x_1 = m_1 \\times10^{n_1}</math> with <math>n_0 = n_1</math>\n\nNext, add or subtract the significands:\n\n:<math>x_0 \\pm x_1=(m_0\\pm m_1)\\times10^{n_0}</math>\n\nAn example:\n\n:<math>2.34\\times10^{-5} + 5.67\\times10^{-6} = 2.34\\times10^{-5} + 0.567\\times10^{-5} = 2.907\\times10^{-5}</math>\n\n=={{anchor|B notation|P notation}}Other bases==\nWhile base ten is normally used for scientific notation, powers of other bases can be used too,<ref name=\"TI_1974_SR-22\">{{cite book |title=electronic hexadecimal calculator/converter SR-22 |publisher=[[Texas Instruments Incorporated]] |date=1974 |page=7 |edition=Revision A |id=1304-389 Rev A |url=http://www.datamath.net/Manuals/SR-22_US.pdf |access-date=2017-03-20 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320001329/http://www.datamath.net/Manuals/SR-22_US.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-20}} (NB.

In order to better distinguish this base-2 exponent from a base-10 exponent, a base-2 exponent is sometimes also indicated by using the letter ''B'' instead of ''E'',<ref name=\"HP16C-Lib\"/> a shorthand notation originally proposed by [[Bruce Alan Martin]] of [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in 1968,<ref name=\"Martin_1968\">{{cite journal |title=Letters to the editor: On binary notation |author-first=Bruce Alan |author-last=Martin |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=11 |issue=10 |date=October 1968 |page=658 |doi=10.1145/364096.364107|bibcode=1985CACM...28...22S}}</ref> as in {{nowrap|1.001<sub>b</sub>B11<sub>b</sub>}} (or shorter: 1.001B11).

The series consists of 100 episodes, each of 15 minutes in length. It was broadcast on [[CBeebies]]. In addition, there are 20 storytimes and 10 Christmas storytimes. \n\nThe series was broadcast between 13 June 2004 and 8 April 2005. Roly Mo was a regular [[storytelling|storyteller]] character in the better known ''Fimbles'' show, and ''The Roly Mo Show'' draws heavily on this. The show is noted for its particularly gentle and pleasant characters and plots.\n\nA show called ''Christmas Storytime'' aired on the CBeebies channel in 2007.\n\nIn the Irish republic, ''The Roly Mo Show'' was broadcast on [[Network 2]] (later changed to RT\u00c92 in 2004) as part of a lineup of programmes for younger children called ''[[The Den (TV programme)|The Den]]'' and started airing on 20 January 2003.\n\nIn Australia from 3 February 2003 to 30 September 2008, ''The Roly Mo Show'' was broadcast on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and its third digital channel [[ABC2]].\n\nAs of 1 June 2007 ''The Roly Mo Show'' (\u7c89\u5b9d\u4e50\u56ed) is being broadcast in [[China]] on [[Shanghai Media Group|Shanghai Media Group's]] children's network ''HAHA TV''. All 200 episodes are being shown sequentially and dubbed in [[Mandarin Chinese]]. As the show in its original format is only 19 minutes long, the show has been lengthened by 5 minutes for the Chinese market.\n\nIn Vietnam, since 2008, ''The Roly Mo Show'' is a part of the show ''5 Minutes to Learn English Everyday'' (5 ph\u00fat h\u1ecdc ti\u1ebfng Anh m\u1ed7i ng\u00e0y), which is produced by [[Ho Chi Minh Television|HTV4]] together with many famous English centers and international schools. However, in VBC, it is a separate show named ''Nh\u1eefng ch\u00fa heo con Fimbles''.\n\nFrom June 2008, the show has also been broadcast by Tata Sky DTH in India under partnership from the [[BBC]] on the country's variant of the CBeebies channel.\n\nIn Colombia from 2004 and 2007, it was broadcast by Se\u00f1al Colombia.\n\nIn New Zealand, the show was played on [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]].\n\nIn South Africa, ''The Roly Mo Show'' began airing on [[SABC 1]].\n\nIn Singapore, it was broadcast by [[Central (TV channel)|Central]] and played it on their children's block ''[[Kids Central]]''.

She hangs up her rucksack and hat and goes down the slide into the main part of Roly's house.\n* One of the characters has a problem; this is the main plot element throughout the episode.\n* Someone reads a story from Roly Mo's library, preceded by the \"When you take a look inside a book\" song.  Most of the time this is Roly, although sometimes this is Little Bo, Rockit, Yugo and Migo or a combination.  The story is related to the problem and often gives an idea for its solution.\n* Little Bo looks in her 'Busy Book', starting the segment of an animated Fimble solving an educational puzzle.\n* The problem is solved, often with a song.\n* The show closes with voice-overs during the credits, which is often humorous or providing further closure.\n\n==Other characters==\n*'''Little Bo''' - a younger and highly intelligent mole. Little Bo has pink and purple stripes, and is Roly's niece. Little Bo is voiced by Tamsin Heatley.\n*'''Yugo and Migo''' - Yugo and Migo are Snoots; orange and yellow [[fox]]-like animals. Yugo is striped and Migo is spotted. They are very dim and manic, and probably created for the amusement of younger viewers. Yugo is voiced by Philip Pope and Migo is voiced by Duncan Wisbey.\n*'''Rockit the Frog'''- an inquisitive and energetic blue tree frog. Rockit is voiced and Puppeteered by Wayne Forrester.\n\n==Catchphrases==\n*\"I'll be back in a Roly Mo!\"\n*\"It's been a Roly Moly day!\"\n*\"Lets roll like Roly Mo!\"\n*\"Story-time with Roly Mo!
