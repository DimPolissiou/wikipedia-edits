The phenomenon sometimes appeared on ships at sea during thunderstorms and was regarded by sailors with religious awe for its glowing ball of light, accounting for the name.<ref>Eyers, Jonathan (2011).

St. Elmo's fire can also appear on leaves and grass, and even at the tips of cattle horns.<ref name=\"island\">Heidorn, K., Ph.D. ''[http://www.islandnet.com/-see/weather/elements/stelmo.htm Weather Elements: The Fire of St. Elmo]''. Retrieved on July 2, 2007.</ref> Often accompanying the glow is a distinct hissing or buzzing sound.  It is sometimes confused with [[ball lightning]].\n\n==Cause==\nSt. Elmo's fire is a form of plasma. The [[electric field]] around the object in question causes [[ionization]] of the air molecules, producing a faint glow easily visible in low-light conditions. Conditions that can generate St. Elmo's fire are present during thunderstorms, when high voltage differentials are present between clouds and the ground underneath. A local [[electric field]] of approximately 100 kV/m is required to induce a discharge in air. The magnitude of the electric field depends greatly on the geometry (shape and size) of the object. Sharp points lower the necessary voltage because electric fields are more concentrated in areas of high [[curvature]], so discharges preferentially occur and are more intense at the ends of pointed objects.\n\nThe [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] in the Earth's atmosphere cause St. Elmo's fire to [[fluoresce]] with blue or violet light; this is similar to the mechanism that causes [[neon sign|neon lights]] to glow.<ref>{{cite web |title= What causes the strange glow known as St. Elmo's Fire?

A minute thereafter, by Heald's estimation, he first noticed a dim \"blue flame\" flickering along the backbone girder about one-quarter the length abaft the bow to the tail. There was time for him to remark to his wife, \"Oh, heavens, the thing is afire,\" for her to reply, \"Where?\" and for him to answer, \"Up along the top ridge\" \u2013 before there was a big burst of flaming hydrogen from a point he estimated to be about one-third the ship's length from the stern.<ref>Robinson, Douglas.

The whirling giant propellers had somehow become great luminous discs of blue flame. The same luminous blue flame appeared on the plexiglass windows in the nose of the ship, and on the tips of the giant wings it looked as though we were riding the whirlwind through space on a chariot of blue fire. It was, I surmised, a surcharge of static electricity that had accumulated on the tips of the propellers and on the dielectric material in the plastic windows. One's thoughts dwelt anxiously on the precious cargo in the invisible ship ahead of us. Was there any likelihood of danger that this heavy electric tension in the atmosphere all about us may set it off? I express my fears to Captain Bock, who seems nonchalant and imperturbed at the controls. He quickly reassures me: \"It is a familiar phenomenon seen often on ships.

However, one of the earliest direct references to St. Elmo's fire made in fiction can be found in [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s epic poem ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (1516). It is located in the 17th canto (19th in the revised edition of 1532) after a storm has punished the ship of Marfisa, Astolfo, Aquilant, Grifon, and others, for three straight days, and is positively associated with hope:\n{{Quote|\nBut now St. Elmo's fire appeared, which they had so longed for, it settled at the bows of a fore stay, the masts and yards all being gone, and gave them hope of calmer airs.|Ludovico Ariosto, 1516\n}}\n\nIn [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'' (c. 1623), Act I, Scene II, St. Elmo's fire acquires a more negative association, appearing as evidence of the tempest inflicted by Ariel according to the command of Prospero:\n\n{{Quote|\n PROSPERO\n:Hast thou, spirit,\n:Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?\n\n ARIEL\n:To every article.\n:I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,\n:Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,\n:I flamed amazement: sometime I'd divide,\n:And burn in many places; on the topmast,\n:The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,\n:Then meet and join.\n| Act I, Scene II\n| ''[[The Tempest]]''\n}}\n\nThe fires are also mentioned as \"death fires\" in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'':\n\n{{Quote|\nAbout, about, in reel and rout,\nThe death fires danced at night;\nThe water, like a witch's oils,\nBurnt green and blue and white.\n}}\n\nLater in 18th century and 19th century, literature associated St. Elmo's fire with bad omen or [[divine judgment]], coinciding with the growing conventions of [[Romanticism]] and the [[Gothic novel]]. For example, in [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794), during a thunderstorm above the ramparts of the castle:\n\n{{Quote|\n\"And what is that tapering of light you bear?\" said Emily, \"see how it darts upwards,\u2014and now it vanishes!\"\n\n\"This light, lady\", said the soldier, \"has appeared to-night as you see it, on the point of my lance, ever since I have been on watch; but what it means I cannot tell\".\n\n\"This is very strange!\" said Emily.\n\n\"My fellow-guard\", continued the man, \"has the same flame on his arms; he says he has sometimes seen it before...he says it is an omen, lady, and bodes no good\".\n\n\"And what harm can it bode?\" rejoined Emily.\n\n\"He knows not so much as that, lady\".\n| Vol. III, Ch. IV\n| ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]''\n}}\n\n\nIn the 1864 novel [[Journey to the Center of the Earth]] by [[Jules Verne]], the author describes the fire occurring while sailing during a subterranean electrical storm (Chapter 35, Page 191):\n\n{{Quote|On the mast already I see the light play of a lambent St. Elmo's fire; the outstretched sail catches not a breath of wind, and hangs like a sheet of lead.\n}}\n\nIn [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', Starbuck points out \"corpusants\" during a thunder storm in the Japanese sea in chapter 119 \"The Candles\".\n\nSt. Elmo's fire makes an appearance in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic, ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', by [[Herg\u00e9]]. [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] recognizes the phenomenon on [[Captain Haddock]]'s [[ice-axe]].\n\nIn [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', [[Billy Pilgrim]] sees the phenomenon on soldiers' helmets and on rooftops. Vonnegut's ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'' also notes the phenomenon affecting Winston Niles Rumfoord's dog, Kazak, the Hound of Space, in conjunction with solar disturbances of the chrono-synclastic infundibulum.\n\nIn \"On The Banks of Plum Creek\" by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] St. Elmo's fire is seen by the girls and Ma during one of the blizzards. It was described as coming down the stove pipe and rolling across the floor following Ma's knitting needles; it didn't burn the floor (pages 309-310).  The phenomenon as described, however, is more similar to [[ball lightning]].\n\nIn \"Voyager,\" the third major novel in [[Diana Gabaldon]]'s popular [[Outlander series|Outlander]] series, the primary characters experience St. Elmo's fire while lost at sea in a thunderstorm between [[Hispaniola]] and coastal [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].\n\n==In television==\nOn the children's television series ''[[The Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'' (1982), Episode 4 shows St. Elmo's Fire affecting the ship as it sailed past the [[Strait of Magellan]]. The real-life footage at the end of the episode has snippets of an interview with Japanese sailor Fukunari Imada, whose comments were translated to \"Although I've never seen St. Elmo's Fire, I'd certainly like to. It was often considered a bad omen as it played havoc with compasses and equipment\". The TV series also referred to St. Elmo's Fire as being a bad omen during the cartoon. The footage was captured as part of his winning solo yacht race in 1981.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/html/cd/1981/198107/19810723/19810723006_6.html Japanese wins solo yacht race across Pacific.]</ref>\n\nOn the American television series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', in a 1959 episode titled \"Incident of the Blue Fire\", [[Droving|cattle drovers]] on a stormy night see St. Elmo's Fire glowing on the horns of their steers, which the men regard as a deadly omen.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/shows/rawhide/incident-of-the-blue-fire-135393/ \"Incident of the Blue Fire\"], ''Rawhide'' (S02E11), originally aired December 11, 1959.

As he takes the rifle from her he proclaims, ''\"Something out there, you could live five lifetimes, and never see again,\"'' the audience is then shown a shot of the cattle with a blue or violet glow coming from their horns. ''\"Look. St. Elmo's Fire. Never seen it except on ships,\"'' O'Malley says as Belle says, ''\"I've never seen it anywhere. What is it?\"''  Trying to win her back he says, ''\"Well a star fell and smashed and scattered its glow all over the place.\"''\n\n''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985) is clearly named after this phenomenon. [[Rob Lowe]]'s character mistakenly claims it's not even a real thing.\n\nIn the western miniseries [[Lonesome Dove (miniseries)]] (1989-1990) lightning strikes a herd of cows during a storm, causing their horns to glow blue.\n\nIn [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'', the phenomenon is clearly observed in the opening sequence and later in the film as the [[rogue planet]] Melancholia approaches Earth for an [[impact event]].\n\nIt is also mentioned in Robert Eggers' 2019 horror film, ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|The Lighthouse]]'' in reference to the mysterious salvation that the Lighthouse Keeper Thomas Wake ([[Willem Dafoe]])) is hiding from Ephraim Winslow ([[Robert Pattinson]]) up inside the Fresnel lens of the lantern.\n\n==In music==\n[[Brian Eno]]'s third studio album ''[[Another Green World]]'' (1975) contains a song titled \"St. Elmo's Fire\" in which guesting [[King Crimson]] guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] (credited with playing \"Wimshurst guitar\" in the liner notes) improvises a lightning-fast solo that would imitate an electrical charge between two poles on a [[Wimshurst machine|Wimshurst high voltage generator]].\n\nMichael Frank's song \"St Elmo's Fire\" was released on his album \"The Art of Tea\" in 1976.

The phenomenon sometimes appeared on ships at sea during thunderstorms and was regarded by sailors with religious awe for its glowing ball of light, accounting for the name.<ref>Eyers, Jonathan (2011).

St. Elmo's fire can also appear on leaves and grass, and even at the tips of cattle horns.<ref name=\"island\">Heidorn, K., Ph.D. ''[http://www.islandnet.com/-see/weather/elements/stelmo.htm Weather Elements: The Fire of St. Elmo]''. Retrieved on July 2, 2007.</ref> Often accompanying the glow is a distinct hissing or buzzing sound.  It is sometimes confused with [[ball lightning]].\n\n==Cause==\nSt. Elmo's fire is a form of plasma. The [[electric field]] around the object in question causes [[ionization]] of the air molecules, producing a faint glow easily visible in low-light conditions. Conditions that can generate St. Elmo's fire are present during thunderstorms, when high voltage differentials are present between clouds and the ground underneath. A local [[electric field]] of approximately 100 kV/m is required to induce a discharge in air. The magnitude of the electric field depends greatly on the geometry (shape and size) of the object. Sharp points lower the necessary voltage because electric fields are more concentrated in areas of high [[curvature]], so discharges preferentially occur and are more intense at the ends of pointed objects.\n\nThe [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] in the Earth's atmosphere cause St. Elmo's fire to [[fluoresce]] with blue or violet light; this is similar to the mechanism that causes [[neon sign|neon lights]] to glow.<ref>{{cite web |title= What causes the strange glow known as St. Elmo's Fire?

It was about nine o'clock, P.M. I had no sooner got on horseback than I observed the tips of both the horse's ears to be quite luminous: the edges of my hat had the same appearance. I was soon deprived of these luminaries by a shower of moist snow which immediately began to fall. The horse's ears soon became wet and lost their luminous appearance; but the edges of my hat, being longer of getting wet, continued to give the luminous appearance somewhat longer.\n\nI could observe an immense number of minute sparks darting towards the horse's ears and the margin of my hat, which produced a very beautiful appearance, and I was sorry to be so soon deprived of it.\n\nThe atmosphere in this neighbourhood appeared to be very highly electrified for eight or ten days about this time. Thunder was heard occasionally from 15th to 23d, during which time the weather was very unsteady: frequent showers of hail, snow, rain, &c.\n\nI can find no person in this quarter who remembers to have ever seen the luminous appearance mentioned above, before this season,\u2014or such a quantity of lightning darting across the heavens,\u2014nor who have heard so much thunder at that season of the year.\n\nThis country being all stocked with sheep, and the herds having frequent occasion to pay attention to the state of the weather, it is not to be thought that such an appearance can have been at all frequent, and none of them to have observed it.<ref group=note>Braid also writes that one of his friends had a similar experience on the evening of the preceding Saturday: in which, his friend reported, he had seen \"his horse's ears being the same as two burning candles, and the edges of his hat being all in a flame\" (p.471).</ref>|James Braid, 1817<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Braid, J. |title=Account of a Thunder Storm in the Neighbourhood of Leadhills, Lanarkshire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsQCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA471 |magazine=Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine |volume=1 |issue=5 |date=August 1817 |pages=471\u2013472}}</ref>\n}}\n\nWeeks earlier, reportedly on 17 January 1817, a luminous snowstorm occurred in Vermont and New Hampshire.

Standing outside the main gate to the Naval Air Station, he watched, together with his wife and son, as the airship approached the mast and dropped her bow lines. A minute thereafter, by Heald's estimation, he first noticed a dim \"blue flame\" flickering along the backbone girder about one-quarter the length abaft the bow to the tail. There was time for him to remark to his wife, \"Oh, heavens, the thing is afire,\" for her to reply, \"Where?\" and for him to answer, \"Up along the top ridge\" \u2013 before there was a big burst of flaming hydrogen from a point he estimated to be about one-third the ship's length from the stern.<ref>Robinson, Douglas.

The whirling giant propellers had somehow become great luminous discs of blue flame. The same luminous blue flame appeared on the plexiglass windows in the nose of the ship, and on the tips of the giant wings it looked as though we were riding the whirlwind through space on a chariot of blue fire. It was, I surmised, a surcharge of static electricity that had accumulated on the tips of the propellers and on the dielectric material in the plastic windows. One's thoughts dwelt anxiously on the precious cargo in the invisible ship ahead of us. Was there any likelihood of danger that this heavy electric tension in the atmosphere all about us may set it off?

However, one of the earliest direct references to St. Elmo's fire made in fiction can be found in [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s epic poem ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (1516). It is located in the 17th canto (19th in the revised edition of 1532) after a storm has punished the ship of Marfisa, Astolfo, Aquilant, Grifon, and others, for three straight days, and is positively associated with hope:\n{{Quote|\nBut now St. Elmo's fire appeared, which they had so longed for, it settled at the bows of a fore stay, the masts and yards all being gone, and gave them hope of calmer airs.|Ludovico Ariosto, 1516\n}}\n\nIn [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'' (c. 1623), Act I, Scene II, St. Elmo's fire acquires a more negative association, appearing as evidence of the tempest inflicted by Ariel according to the command of Prospero:\n\n{{Quote|\n PROSPERO\n:Hast thou, spirit,\n:Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?\n\n ARIEL\n:To every article.\n:I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,\n:Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,\n:I flamed amazement: sometime I'd divide,\n:And burn in many places; on the topmast,\n:The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,\n:Then meet and join.\n| Act I, Scene II\n| ''[[The Tempest]]''\n}}\n\nThe fires are also mentioned as \"death fires\" in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''.\n{{Quote|\nAbout, about, in reel and rout, The death fires danced at night; The water, like a witch's oils, Burnt green and blue and white.}}\n\nLater in 18th century and 19th century literature associated St. Elmo's fire with bad omen or [[divine judgment]], coinciding with the growing conventions of [[Romanticism]] and the [[Gothic novel]]. For example, in [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794), during a thunderstorm above the ramparts of the castle:\n\n{{Quote|\n\"And what is that tapering of light you bear?\" said Emily, \"see how it darts upwards,\u2014and now it vanishes!\"\n\n\"This light, lady\", said the soldier, \"has appeared to-night as you see it, on the point of my lance, ever since I have been on watch; but what it means I cannot tell\".\n\n\"This is very strange!\" said Emily.\n\n\"My fellow-guard\", continued the man, \"has the same flame on his arms; he says he has sometimes seen it before...he says it is an omen, lady, and bodes no good\".\n\n\"And what harm can it bode?\" rejoined Emily.\n\n\"He knows not so much as that, lady\".\n| Vol. III, Ch. IV\n| ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]''\n}}\n\n\nIn the 1864 novel [[Journey to the Center of the Earth]] by [[Jules Verne]], the author describes the fire occurring while sailing during a subterranean electrical storm (Chapter 35, Page 191):\n\n{{Quote|On the mast already I see the light play of a lambent St. Elmo's fire; the outstretched sail catches not a breath of wind, and hangs like a sheet of lead.\n}}\n\nIn [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', Starbuck points out \"corpusants\" during a thunder storm in the Japanese sea in chapter 119 \"The Candles\".\n\nSt. Elmo's fire makes an appearance in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic, ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', by [[Herg\u00e9]]. [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] recognizes the phenomenon on [[Captain Haddock]]'s [[ice-axe]].\n\nIn [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', [[Billy Pilgrim]] sees the phenomenon on soldiers' helmets and on rooftops. Vonnegut's ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'' also notes the phenomenon affecting Winston Niles Rumfoord's dog, Kazak, the Hound of Space, in conjunction with solar disturbances of the chrono-synclastic infundibulum.\n\nIn \"On The Banks of Plum Creek\" by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] St. Elmo's fire is seen by the girls and Ma during one of the blizzards. It was described as coming down the stove pipe and rolling across the floor following Ma's knitting needles; it didn't burn the floor (pages 309-310).  The phenomenon as described, however, is more similar to [[ball lightning]].\n\nIn \"Voyager,\" the third major novel in [[Diana Gabaldon]]'s popular [[Outlander series|Outlander]] series, the primary characters experience St. Elmo's fire while lost at sea in a thunderstorm between [[Hispaniola]] and coastal [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].\n\n==In television==\nOn the children's television series ''[[The Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'' (1982), Episode 4 shows St. Elmo's Fire affecting the ship as it sailed past the [[Strait of Magellan]]. The real-life footage at the end of the episode has snippets of an interview with Japanese sailor Fukunari Imada, whose comments were translated to \"Although I've never seen St. Elmo's Fire, I'd certainly like to. It was often considered a bad omen as it played havoc with compasses and equipment\". The TV series also referred to St. Elmo's Fire as being a bad omen during the cartoon. The footage was captured as part of his winning solo yacht race in 1981.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/html/cd/1981/198107/19810723/19810723006_6.html Japanese wins solo yacht race across Pacific.]</ref>\n\nOn the American television series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', in a 1959 episode titled \"Incident of the Blue Fire\", [[Droving|cattle drovers]] on a stormy night see St. Elmo's Fire glowing on the horns of their steers, which the men regard as a deadly omen.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/shows/rawhide/incident-of-the-blue-fire-135393/ \"Incident of the Blue Fire\"], ''Rawhide'' (S02E11), originally aired December 11, 1959.

As he takes the rifle from her he proclaims, ''\"Something out there, you could live five lifetimes, and never see again,\"'' the audience is then shown a shot of the cattle with a blue or violet glow coming from their horns. ''\"Look. St. Elmo's Fire. Never seen it except on ships,\"'' O'Malley says as Belle says, ''\"I've never seen it anywhere. What is it?\"''  Trying to win her back he says, ''\"Well a star fell and smashed and scattered its glow all over the place.\"''\n\n''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985) is clearly named after this phenomenon. [[Rob Lowe]]'s character mistakenly claims it's not even a real thing.\n\nIn the western miniseries [[Lonesome Dove (miniseries)]] (1989-1990) lightning strikes a herd of cows during a storm, causing their horns to glow blue.\n\nIn [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'', the phenomenon is clearly observed in the opening sequence and later in the film as the [[rogue planet]] Melancholia approaches Earth for an [[impact event]].\n\nIt is also mentioned in Robert Eggers' 2019 horror film, ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|The Lighthouse]]'' in reference to the mysterious salvation that the Lighthouse Keeper Thomas Wake ([[Willem Dafoe]])) is hiding from Ephraim Winslow ([[Robert Pattinson]]) up inside the Fresnel lens of the lantern.\n\n==In music==\n[[Brian Eno]]'s third studio album ''[[Another Green World]]'' (1975) contains a song titled \"St. Elmo's Fire\" in which guesting [[King Crimson]] guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] (credited with playing \"Wimshurst guitar\" in the liner notes) improvises a lightning-fast solo that would imitate an electrical charge between two poles on a [[Wimshurst machine|Wimshurst high voltage generator]].\n\nMichael Frank's song \"St Elmo's Fire\" was released on his album \"The Art of Tea\" in 1976. His song has since been sampled various times by artists like Absolutely Fabolous, & more.\n\nThe first song in [[Susumu Hirasawa]]'s album [[Aurora (Susumu Hirasawa album)|Aurora]], \"Stone Garden\" (\u77f3\u306e\u5ead ''Ishi no Niwa''), contains a line which translates to <blockquote><poem>That day when I melted away into the sky\nBurning like St. Elmo's sacred fire<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phonon-belt.livejournal.com/16958.html|title=\u5e73\u6ca2\u9032 -\u300c\u77f3\u306e\u5ead |trans-title=Hirasawa Susumu - \"Stone Garden\" Lyrics |author=phonon_belt |date=October 25, 2011 |language=ja |website=phonon-belt.livejournal.com/ |access-date=}}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\n\"[[St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)]]\" is a song recorded by [[John Parr]].

Korea KS PC-Data encoding (IBM-949).svg|thumb|Layout of the IBM-949 code page]]\n'''IBM code page 949''' (IBM-949) is IBM's PC Data KS code. It implements [[EUC-KR]] in addition to encodings for IBM extensions including [[Private Use Areas#Private-use characters in other character sets|user defined characters]]. This [[code page]] supports the [[Korean language]]. It is a combination of the single-byte '''Code page 1088''' and the double-byte [[Code page 951]].\n\nBytes 0x00 through 0x7F are used for single byte KS X 1003 ([[ISO 646]]:KR) characters, a similar set to ASCII. Bytes 0x80 through 0x84 are used for IBM single byte extension characters. Lead bytes 0x8F through 0xA0 are used for IBM double byte extension characters. Lead bytes 0xA1 through 0xFE are used for Wansung code ([[KS X 1001]] characters in EUC-KR form, double byte).\n\nIBM-949 should not be confused with [[Unified Hangul Code|Windows code page 949]] (IBM-1363), which is Microsoft's Unified Hangul Code, a different extension of EUC-KR, nor with plain EUC-KR ([[Code page 970|IBM-970]]).\n\n== Single byte codes

{"title_page": "History of neuroscience", "text_new": "From the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Mummy|mummifications]] to 18th-century scientific research on \"globules\" and [[neuron]]s, there is evidence of [[Neuroscience#History|neuroscience]] practice throughout the early periods of history. The early civilizations lacked adequate means to obtain knowledge about the human brain. Their assumptions about the inner workings of the mind, therefore, were not accurate. Early views on the function of the [[brain]] regarded it to be a form of \"cranial stuffing\" of sorts. In ancient Egypt, from the late [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] onwards, in preparation for mummification, the brain was regularly removed, for it was the [[heart]] that was assumed to be the seat of intelligence. According to [[Herodotus]], during the first step of mummification: \"The most perfect practice is to extract as much of the brain as possible with an iron hook, and what the hook cannot reach is mixed with drugs.\" Over the next five thousand years, this view came to be reversed; the brain is now known to be the seat of intelligence, although colloquial variations of the former remain as in \"memorizing something by heart\".\n\n== Early views ==\n\n[[File:hieroglyphic-brain.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Hieroglyphic for the word \"brain\" (c.1700 BC)]]\nThe [[Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus]], written in the 17th century BC, contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain. The [[hieroglyph]] for brain, occurring eight times in this papyrus, describes the symptoms, diagnosis, and prognosis of two patients, wounded in the head, who had compound fractures of the skull. The assessments of the author (a battlefield surgeon) of the papyrus allude to ancient Egyptians having a vague recognition of the effects of head trauma. While the symptoms are well written and detailed, the absence of a medical precedent is apparent. The author of the passage notes \"the pulsations of the exposed brain\" and compared the surface of the brain to the rippling surface of copper slag (which indeed has a gyral-sulcal pattern). The laterality of injury was related to the laterality of symptom, and both aphasia (\"he speaks not to thee\") and seizures (\"he shudders exceedingly\") after head injury were described. Observations by ancient civilizations of the human brain suggest only a relative understanding of the basic mechanics and the importance of cranial security. Furthermore, considering the general consensus of medical practice pertaining to human anatomy was based on myths and superstition, the thoughts of the battlefield surgeon appear to be empirical and based on logical deduction and simple observation.<ref name=Kandel>{{cite book | authorlink = Eric R.

However, due to the fact that Hippocratic doctors did not practice dissection, because the human body was considered sacred, Greek views of brain function were generally uninformed by anatomical study. It is said that it was the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[Alcmaeon of Croton]] (6th and 5th centuries BC) who first considered the brain to be the place where the mind was located. According to ancient authorities, \"he believed the seat of sensations is in the brain. This contains the governing faculty. All the senses are connected in some way with the brain; consequently, they are incapable of action if the brain is disturbed...the power of the brain to synthesize sensations makes it also the seat of thought: The storing up of perceptions gives memory and belief and when these are stabilized you get knowledge.\"<ref name=\"Adelman\"/> In the 4th century BC, [[Hippocrates]] believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence (based, among others before him, on Alcmaeon's work). During the 4th century BC [[Aristotle]] thought that, while the heart was the seat of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], the brain was a cooling mechanism for the blood. He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness.<ref name=Bear>{{cite book | last = Bear | first = M.F. |author2=B.W.

During the Hellenistic period, [[Herophilus]] of Chalcedon (c.335/330\u2013280/250 BC) and [[Erasistratus]] of Ceos (c. 300\u2013240 BC) made fundamental contributions not only to brain and nervous systems' anatomy and physiology, but to many other fields of the bio-sciences. Herophilus not only distinguished the [[cerebral cortex|cerebrum]] and the [[cerebellum]], but provided the first clear description of the [[Ventricular system|ventricles]]. Erasistratus used practical application by experimenting on the living brain. Their works are now mostly lost, and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources. Some of their discoveries had to be re-discovered a millennium after their death.<ref name=\"Adelman\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Roman Empire]], the Greek anatomist [[Galen]] dissected the brains of [[sheep]], monkeys, dogs, swine, among other non-human mammals. He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the [[muscle]]s, while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where the senses were processed. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles. \"Further, his studies of the cranial nerves and spinal cord were outstanding. He noted that specific spinal nerves controlled specific muscles, and had the idea of the reciprocal action of muscles. For the next advance in understanding spinal function we must await Bell and Magendie in the 19th Century.\"<ref name=\"Adelman\"/><ref name=Bear/>\n\n==Middle Ages==\nIslamic medicine in the middle ages was focused on how the mind and body interacted and emphasized a need to understand mental health.\nCirca 1000, [[Al-Zahrawi]], living in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Iberia]], evaluated neurological patients and performed surgical treatments of head injuries, skull fractures, spinal injuries, hydrocephalus, subdural effusions and headache.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Al-Rodhan|first=N.

He wrote 40 pieces on medicine with the most notable being the Qanun, a medical encyclopedia that would be a staple at universities for nearly a hundred years. He also explained phenomena such as, insomnia, mania, hallucinations, nightmare, dementia, epilepsy, stroke, paralysis, vertigo, melancholia and tremors. He also discovered a condition similar to schizophrenia, which he called Junun Mufrit, characterized by agitation, behavioral and sleep disturbances, giving inappropriate answers to questions, and occasional inability to speak. Avicenna also discovered the cerebellar vermis, which he simply called the vermis, and the caudate nucleus. Both terms are still used in neuroanatomy today.

The early civilizations lacked adequate means to obtain knowledge about the human brain. Their assumptions about the inner workings of the mind, therefore, were not accurate. Early views on the function of the [[brain]] regarded it to be a form of \"cranial stuffing\" of sorts. In ancient Egypt, from the late [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] onwards, in preparation for mummification, the brain was regularly removed, for it was the [[heart]] that was assumed to be the seat of intelligence. According to [[Herodotus]], during the first step of mummification: \"The most perfect practice is to extract as much of the brain as possible with an iron hook, and what the hook cannot reach is mixed with drugs.\" Over the next five thousand years, this view came to be reversed; the brain is now known to be the seat of intelligence, although colloquial variations of the former remain as in \"memorizing something by heart\".\n\n== Early views ==\n\n[[File:hieroglyphic-brain.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Hieroglyphic for the word \"brain\" (c.1700 BC)]]\nThe [[Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus]], written in the 17th century BC, contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain. The [[hieroglyph]] for brain, occurring eight times in this papyrus, describes the symptoms, diagnosis, and prognosis of two patients, wounded in the head, who had compound fractures of the skull. The assessments of the author (a battlefield surgeon) of the papyrus allude to ancient Egyptians having a vague recognition of the effects of head trauma. While the symptoms are well written and detailed, the absence of a medical precedent is apparent. The author of the passage notes \"the pulsations of the exposed brain\" and compared the surface of the brain to the rippling surface of copper slag (which indeed has a gyral-sulcal pattern). The laterality of injury was related to the laterality of symptom, and both aphasia (\"he speaks not to thee\") and seizures (\"he shudders exceedingly\") after head injury were described. Observations by ancient civilizations of the human brain suggest only a relative understanding of the basic mechanics and the importance of cranial security. Furthermore, considering the general consensus of medical practice pertaining to human anatomy was based on myths and superstition, the thoughts of the battlefield surgeon appear to be empirical and based on logical deduction and simple observation.<ref name=Kandel>{{cite book | authorlink = Eric R.

In 1939 they began using internal electrodes inside the giant nerve fibre of the squid and Cole developed the [[voltage clamp]] technique in 1947. Hodgkin and [[Andrew Huxley]] later presented a mathematical model for transmission of electrical signals in neurons of the giant axon of a squid and how they are initiated and propagated, known as the [[Hodgkin\u2013Huxley model]]. In 1961\u20131962, Richard FitzHugh and J. Nagumo simplified Hodgkin\u2013Huxley, in what is called the [[FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo model]]. In 1962, [[Bernard Katz]] modeled [[neurotransmission]] across the space between neurons known as [[synapses]]. Beginning in 1966, Eric Kandel and collaborators examined biochemical changes in neurons associated with learning and memory storage in ''[[Aplysia]]''. In 1981 Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar combined these models in the [[Morris\u2013Lecar model]]. Such increasingly quantitative work gave rise to numerous [[biological neuron model]]s and [[models of neural computation]].\n\n[[Eric Kandel]] and collaborators have cited [[David Rioch]], [[Francis O. Schmitt]], and [[Stephen Kuffler]] as having played critical roles in establishing the field.<ref name=Rioch>{{Cite journal|last1=Cowan|first1=W.M.|last2=Harter|first2=D.H.|last3=Kandel|first3=E.R.|date=2000|title=The emergence of modern neuroscience: Some implications for neurology and psychiatry|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|volume=23|pages=345\u2013346|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.343|pmid=10845068}}</ref> Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]], starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established a neuroscience research program within the Biology Department at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], bringing together biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. The first freestanding neuroscience department (then called Psychobiology) was founded in 1964 at the [[University of California, Irvine]] by [[James L. McGaugh]]. [[Stephen Kuffler]] started the Department of Neurobiology at [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1966. The first official use of the word \"Neuroscience\" may be in 1962 with [[Francis O. Schmitt]]'s \"[[Neuroscience Research Program]]\", which was hosted by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfn.org:443/About/History%20of%20SfN/1969-1995/Chapter%201|title=Chapter I: Neuroscience Before Neuroscience, WWII to 1969|website=www.sfn.org|language=en|access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref>\n\nOver time, brain research has gone through philosophical, experimental, and theoretical phases, with work on brain simulation predicted to be important in the future.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fan|first=Xue|last2=Markram|first2=Henry|date=2019-05-07|title=A Brief History of Simulation Neuroscience|journal=Frontiers in Neuroinformatics|volume=13|pages=32|doi=10.3389/fninf.2019.00032|pmid=31133838|pmc=6513977|issn=1662-5196}}</ref>\n\n==Neuroscience institutes and organizations==\nAs a result of the increasing interest about the nervous system, several prominent neuroscience institutes and organizations have been formed to provide a forum to all neuroscientists.
