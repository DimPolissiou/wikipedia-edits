Born into the [[House of Gl\u00fccksburg]], a [[royal house]] with origins in [[northern Germany]], she was the eldest child of [[Frederick IX of Denmark]] and [[Ingrid of Sweden]]. She became [[heir presumptive]] to her father in 1953, when [[Danish Act of Succession|a constitutional amendment]] allowed women to inherit the throne.\n\nMargrethe succeeded her father upon his death on 14 January 1972. On her accession, she became the first female monarch of Denmark since [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margrethe I]], ruler of the [[Scandinavia]]n kingdoms in 1375\u20131412 during the [[Kalmar Union]]. In 1967, she married [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Henri de Laborde de Monpezat]], with whom she has two sons: [[Crown Prince Frederik]] and [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Prince Joachim]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Amalienborg cph.jpg|thumb|left|Princess Margrethe's birthplace: Frederik VIII's Palace at [[Amalienborg]], photographed in 2006]]\nPrincess Margrethe was born 16 April 1940 at [[Amalienborg]] in [[Copenhagen]] as the first child of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess (later [[King Frederick IX]] and [[Queen Ingrid]]). Her father was the eldest son of the then-reigning [[King Christian X]], while her mother was the only daughter of the Crown Prince of Sweden (later [[King Gustaf VI Adolf]]). Her birth took place just one week after [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|invasion of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940.<ref name=r1/>\n\nShe was [[baptism|baptised]] on 14 May in the [[Holmen Church]] in [[Copenhagen]].<ref name=r1/> The Princess's [[godparent]]s were: [[King Christian X]] (paternal grandfather); [[Prince Knud of Denmark|Hereditary Prince Knud]] (paternal uncle); [[Prince Axel of Denmark|Prince Axel]] (her paternal grandfather's first cousin); [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustaf V of Sweden]] (maternal great-grandfather); [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden]] (maternal grandfather); [[Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V\u00e4sterbotten]] (her maternal uncle); [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] (maternal great-grandfather).\n\nShe was named Margrethe after her late maternal grandmother, [[Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden]], Alexandrine after her paternal grandmother, [[Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Queen Alexandrine]], and Ingrid after her mother. Since her paternal grandfather was also the [[King of Iceland]], she was given the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] name \u00de\u00f3rhildur.<ref>{{cite web | title = Navnet til den ny prinsesse... | website = nfi.ku.dk | publisher = Nordisk Forskningsinstitut, [[University of Copenhagen]] | date = 18 May 2012 | url = http://nfi.ku.dk/nyheder/prinsessenavn2012/ | access-date = 23 January 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170202083411/http://nfi.ku.dk/nyheder/prinsessenavn2012/ | archive-date = 2 February 2017 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhen Margrethe was four years old, in 1944, her younger sister [[Princess Benedikte of Denmark|Princess Benedikte]] was born. Princess Benedikte later married [[Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] and lives some of the time in Germany. Her second sister, [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Princess Anne-Marie]], was born in 1946. Anne-Marie later married [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II of the Hellenes]] and currently lives in [[Greece]].\n\nMargrethe and her sisters grew up in apartments at Frederick VIII's Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in [[Fredensborg Palace]] in [[North Zealand]]. She spent summer holidays with the royal family in her parent's summer residence at [[Gr\u00e5sten Palace]] in [[Southern Jutland]]. On 20 April 1947, King Christian X died and Margrethe's father ascended the throne as King Frederick IX.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\n[[File:Margrethe II of Denmark 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Princess Margrethe in 1966]]\nAt the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark, owing to the changes in succession laws enacted in the 1850s when the [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg|Gl\u00fccksburg]] branch was chosen to succeed. As she had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark|Prince Knud]] would one day assume the throne.\n\nThe process of changing the constitution started in 1947, not long after her father ascended the throne and it became clear that Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederick and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution. The law required that the proposal be passed by two successive Parliaments and then by a referendum, which occurred 27 March 1953. The new [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]] permitted female [[Order of succession|succession]] to the throne of Denmark, according to [[male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], where a female can ascend to the throne only if she does not have a brother. Princess Margrethe therefore became [[heir presumptive]].<ref name=r1/>\n\nOn her eighteenth birthday, 16 April 1958, Margrethe was given a seat in the [[Danish Council of State|Council of State]]. She subsequently chaired the meetings of the Council in the absence of the King.<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn 1960, together with the princesses of Sweden and Norway, she travelled to the United States, which included a visit to [[Los Angeles]], and to the [[Paramount Studios]], where they met several celebrities, including [[Dean Martin]], [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=Elvis>{{cite web|title=Elvis Presley with Princesses Margrethe of Denmark, Astrid of Norway, and Margaretha of Sweden|url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|website=Elvispresleymusic.com.au|date=7 June 1960|accessdate=11 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909182159/http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|archivedate=9 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nMargrethe was educated at the private school [[N.

Laborde de Monpezat received the style and title of \"His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark\" because of his new position as the spouse of the heir presumptive to the Danish [[throne]].<ref name=r1/> They were married for over fifty years, until his death on 13 February 2018.\n\nMargrethe gave birth to her first child 26 May 1968. By tradition, Danish kings were alternately named either Frederick or Christian. She chose to maintain this by assuming the position of a Christian, and thus named her eldest son [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Frederik]]. A second child, named [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Joachim]], was born 7 June 1969.<ref name=r1/>\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Faroe stamp 302 Queen Margrethe.jpg|thumb|200px|Margrethe II of Denmark in a costume of the [[Faroese people]].

At his death 14 days later, 14 January 1972, Margrethe succeeded to the throne at the age of 31, becoming the first female Danish [[monarch|sovereign]] under the new Act of Succession. She was proclaimed Queen from the balcony of [[Christiansborg Palace]] 15 January 1972, by [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] [[Jens Otto Krag]]. Queen Margrethe II relinquished all the monarch's former titles except the title to Denmark, hence her style \"[[By the Grace of God]], Queen of Denmark\" ({{lang-da|Margrethe den Anden, af Guds N\u00e5de Danmarks Dronning}}). The Queen chose the [[Royal mottos of Danish monarchs|motto]]: ''God's help, the love of The People, Denmark's strength.''<ref name=\"Margrethe and Henrik Biography\"/>\n\nIn her first address to the people, Queen Margrethe II said: {{quote|My beloved father, our King, is dead.

The Queen performs the latter task by accepting invitations to open exhibitions, attending anniversaries, inaugurating bridges, etc. She receives foreign ambassadors and awards honours and medals. \n\nAs an unelected public official, the Queen takes no part in party politics and does not express any political opinions. Although she has the right to vote, she opts not to do so to avoid even the appearance of partisanship.<ref name=r1/>\n\nAfter an election where the incumbent [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] does not have a majority behind him or her, the Queen holds a \u201cDronningerunde\u201d (Queen's meeting) in which she meets the chairmen of each of the [[List of political parties in Denmark|Danish political parties]].<ref name=Todays>{{cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |title=The Monarchy today |publisher=Kongehuset.dk |accessdate=11 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215082552/http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |archive-date=15 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEach party has the choice of selecting a Royal Investigator to lead these negotiations or alternatively, give the incumbent Prime Minister the mandate to continue his government as is. In theory each party could choose its own leader as Royal Investigator, the social liberal [[Det Radikale Venstre]] did so in 2006, but often only one Royal Investigator is chosen plus the Prime Minister, before each election. The leader who, at that meeting succeeds in securing a majority of the seats in the [[Folketing]], is by royal decree charged with the task of forming a new government. (It has never happened in more modern history{{when|date=January 2020}} that any party has held a majority on its own.)\n\nOnce the government has been formed, it is formally appointed by the Queen. Officially, it is the Queen who is the head of government, and she therefore presides over the Council of State ([[privy council]]), where the acts of legislation which have been passed by the parliament are signed into law. In practice, however, nearly all of the Queen's formal powers are exercised by the [[Cabinet of Denmark]].\n\nIn addition to her roles in her own country, the Queen is also the [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]], an infantry regiment of the [[British Army]], following a tradition in her family.<ref name=r1/>\n\n===Ruby Jubilee===\nQueen Margrethe II celebrated her [[Ruby Jubilee]], the 40th year on the throne, on 14 January 2012.<ref name=BBC40>{{cite news |title=Queen Margrethe II of Denmark marks 40 years on the throne |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16531823 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 January 2012}}</ref> This was marked by a carriage procession, a gala banquet at [[Christiansborg Palace]] and numerous TV interviews.\n\n=== Immigration debate ===\nIn an interview within the 2016 book ''De dybeste r\u00f8dder'' (''The Deepest Roots''), according to historians at the [[South Campus (University of Copenhagen)|Saxo Institute]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]] she showed a change in attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture in order to be able to teach them to new arrivals. She further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.<ref name=\"tv2_dk_23October2016\">{{cite news|title=Historiker om Margrethes danskheds-udtalelse: - Hun har fulgt folkesj\u00e6lens bekymringer|url=http://nyheder.tv2.dk/politik/2016-10-23-historiker-om-margrethes-danskheds-udtalelse-hun-har-fulgt-folkesjaelens|accessdate=25 October 2016|publisher=[[TV2 (Denmark)]]|date=23 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"b_dk_22October2016\">{{cite news|title=Dronning Margrethe om integration: \"Det er ikke en naturlov, at man bliver dansker af at bo i Danmark\"|url=http://www.b.dk/politiko/dronning-margrethe-om-integration-det-er-ikke-en-naturlov-at-man-bliver-dans|accessdate=25 October 2016|newspaper=[[Berlingske Tidende]]|date=22 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life and interests==\n\nThe official residences of the Queen are [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen and [[Fredensborg Palace]].

She sent them to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] who was struck by the similarity of her drawings to his own style. Margrethe's drawings were redrawn by the British artist [[Eric Fraser (illustrator)|Eric Fraser]] in the translation published in 1977 and re-issued in 2002. In 2000, she illustrated Henrik, the Prince Consort's [[Cantabile (book)|poetry collection ''Cantabile'']].

Born into the [[House of Gl\u00fccksburg]], a [[royal house]] with origins in [[northern Germany]], she was the eldest child of [[Frederick IX of Denmark]] and [[Ingrid of Sweden]]. She became [[heir presumptive]] to her father in 1953, when [[Danish Act of Succession|a constitutional amendment]] allowed women to inherit the throne.\n\nMargrethe succeeded her father upon his death on 14 January 1972. On her accession, she became the first female monarch of Denmark since [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margrethe I]], ruler of the [[Scandinavia]]n kingdoms in 1375\u20131412 during the [[Kalmar Union]]. In 1967, she married [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Henri de Laborde de Monpezat]], with whom she has two sons: [[Crown Prince Frederik]] and [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Prince Joachim]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Amalienborg cph.jpg|thumb|left|Princess Margrethe's birthplace: Frederik VIII's Palace at [[Amalienborg]], photographed in 2006]]\nPrincess Margrethe was born 16 April 1940 at [[Amalienborg]] in [[Copenhagen]] as the first child of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess (later [[King Frederick IX]] and [[Queen Ingrid]]). Her father was the eldest son of the then-reigning [[King Christian X]], while her mother was the only daughter of the Crown Prince of Sweden (later [[King Gustaf VI Adolf]]). Her birth took place just one week after [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|invasion of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940.<ref name=r1/>\n\nShe was [[baptism|baptised]] on 14 May in the [[Holmen Church]] in [[Copenhagen]].<ref name=r1/> The Princess's [[godparent]]s were: [[King Christian X]] (paternal grandfather); [[Prince Knud of Denmark|Hereditary Prince Knud]] (paternal uncle); [[Prince Axel of Denmark|Prince Axel]] (her paternal grandfather's first cousin); [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustaf V of Sweden]] (maternal great-grandfather); [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden]] (maternal grandfather); [[Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V\u00e4sterbotten]] (her maternal uncle); [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] (maternal great-grandfather).\n\nShe was named Margrethe after her late maternal grandmother, [[Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden]], Alexandrine after her paternal grandmother, [[Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Queen Alexandrine]], and Ingrid after her mother. Since her paternal grandfather was also the [[King of Iceland]], she was given the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] name \u00de\u00f3rhildur.<ref>{{cite web | title = Navnet til den ny prinsesse... | website = nfi.ku.dk | publisher = Nordisk Forskningsinstitut, [[University of Copenhagen]] | date = 18 May 2012 | url = http://nfi.ku.dk/nyheder/prinsessenavn2012/ | access-date = 23 January 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170202083411/http://nfi.ku.dk/nyheder/prinsessenavn2012/ | archive-date = 2 February 2017 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhen Margrethe was four years old, in 1944, her younger sister [[Princess Benedikte of Denmark|Princess Benedikte]] was born. Princess Benedikte later married [[Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] and lives some of the time in Germany. Her second sister, [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Princess Anne-Marie]], was born in 1946. Anne-Marie later married [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II of the Hellenes]] and currently lives in [[Greece]].\n\nMargrethe and her sisters grew up in apartments at Frederick VIII's Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in [[Fredensborg Palace]] in [[North Zealand]]. She spent summer holidays with the royal family in her parent's summer residence at [[Gr\u00e5sten Palace]] in [[Southern Jutland]]. On 20 April 1947, King Christian X died and Margrethe's father ascended the throne as King Frederick IX.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\n[[File:Margrethe II of Denmark 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Princess Margrethe in 1966]]\nAt the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark, owing to the changes in succession laws enacted in the 1850s when the [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg|Gl\u00fccksburg]] branch was chosen to succeed. As she had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark|Prince Knud]] would one day assume the throne.\n\nThe process of changing the constitution started in 1947, not long after her father ascended the throne and it became clear that Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederick and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution. The law required that the proposal be passed by two successive Parliaments and then by a referendum, which occurred 27 March 1953. The new [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]] permitted female [[Order of succession|succession]] to the throne of Denmark, according to [[male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], where a female can ascend to the throne only if she does not have a brother. Princess Margrethe therefore became [[heir presumptive]].<ref name=r1/>\n\nOn her eighteenth birthday, 16 April 1958, Margrethe was given a seat in the [[Danish Council of State|Council of State]]. She subsequently chaired the meetings of the Council in the absence of the King.<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn 1960, together with the princesses of Sweden and Norway, she travelled to the United States, which included a visit to [[Los Angeles]], and to the [[Paramount Studios]], where they met several celebrities, including [[Dean Martin]], [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=Elvis>{{cite web|title=Elvis Presley with Princesses Margrethe of Denmark, Astrid of Norway, and Margaretha of Sweden|url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|website=Elvispresleymusic.com.au|date=7 June 1960|accessdate=11 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909182159/http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|archivedate=9 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nMargrethe was educated at the private school [[N.

Laborde de Monpezat received the style and title of \"His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark\" because of his new position as the spouse of the heir presumptive to the Danish [[throne]].<ref name=r1/> They were married for over fifty years, until his death on 13 February 2018.\n\nMargrethe gave birth to her first child 26 May 1968. By tradition, Danish kings were alternately named either Frederick or Christian. She chose to maintain this by assuming the position of a Christian, and thus named her eldest son [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Frederik]]. A second child, named [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Joachim]], was born 7 June 1969.<ref name=r1/>\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Faroe stamp 302 Queen Margrethe.jpg|thumb|200px|Margrethe II of Denmark in a costume of the [[Faroese people]].

At his death 14 days later, 14 January 1972, Margrethe succeeded to the throne at the age of 31, becoming the first female Danish [[monarch|sovereign]] under the new Act of Succession. She was proclaimed Queen from the balcony of [[Christiansborg Palace]] 15 January 1972, by [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] [[Jens Otto Krag]]. Queen Margrethe II relinquished all the monarch's former titles except the title to Denmark, hence her style \"[[By the Grace of God]], Queen of Denmark\" ({{lang-da|Margrethe den Anden, af Guds N\u00e5de Danmarks Dronning}}). The Queen chose the [[Royal mottos of Danish monarchs|motto]]: ''God's help, the love of The People, Denmark's strength.''<ref name=\"Margrethe and Henrik Biography\"/>\n\nIn her first address to the people, Queen Margrethe II said: {{quote|My beloved father, our King, is dead.

May the trust that was given to my father also be granted to me.<ref name=\"radical royalist\">{{cite journal|url=http://radicalroyalist.blogspot.com.br/2012_01_01_archive.html#post-body-3282259268133616607|publisher=Radical Royalist|title=Queen Margrethe II of Denmark 40 years on the Throne|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref>}}\n\n===Constitutional role===\nThe Queen's main tasks are to represent the Kingdom abroad and to be a unifying figure at home. The Queen performs the latter task by accepting invitations to open exhibitions, attending anniversaries, inaugurating bridges, etc. She receives foreign ambassadors and awards honours and medals. \n\nAs an unelected public official, the Queen takes no part in party politics and does not express any political opinions. Although she has the right to vote, she opts not to do so to avoid even the appearance of partisanship.<ref name=r1/>\n\nAfter an election where the incumbent [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] does not have a majority behind him or her, the Queen holds a \u201cDronningerunde\u201d (Queen's meeting) in which she meets the chairmen of each of the [[List of political parties in Denmark|Danish political parties]].<ref name=Todays>{{cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |title=The Monarchy today |publisher=Kongehuset.dk |accessdate=11 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215082552/http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |archive-date=15 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEach party has the choice of selecting a Royal Investigator to lead these negotiations or alternatively, give the incumbent Prime Minister the mandate to continue his government as is. In theory each party could choose its own leader as Royal Investigator, the social liberal [[Det Radikale Venstre]] did so in 2006, but often only one Royal Investigator is chosen plus the Prime Minister, before each election. The leader who, at that meeting succeeds in securing a majority of the seats in the [[Folketing]], is by royal decree charged with the task of forming a new government. (It has never happened in more modern history{{when|date=January 2020}} that any party has held a majority on its own.)\n\nOnce the government has been formed, it is formally appointed by the Queen. Officially, it is the Queen who is the head of government, and she therefore presides over the Council of State ([[privy council]]), where the acts of legislation which have been passed by the parliament are signed into law. In practice, however, nearly all of the Queen's formal powers are exercised by the [[Cabinet of Denmark]].\n\nIn addition to her roles in her own country, the Queen is also the [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]], an infantry regiment of the [[British Army]], following a tradition in her family.<ref name=r1/>\n\n===Ruby Jubilee===\nQueen Margrethe II celebrated her [[Ruby Jubilee]], the 40th year on the throne, on 14 January 2012.<ref name=BBC40>{{cite news |title=Queen Margrethe II of Denmark marks 40 years on the throne |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16531823 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 January 2012}}</ref> This was marked by a carriage procession, a gala banquet at [[Christiansborg Palace]] and numerous TV interviews.\n\n=== Immigration debate ===\nIn an interview within the 2016 book ''De dybeste r\u00f8dder'' (''The Deepest Roots''), according to historians at the [[South Campus (University of Copenhagen)|Saxo Institute]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]] she showed a change in attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture in order to be able to teach them to new arrivals. She further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.<ref name=\"tv2_dk_23October2016\">{{cite news|title=Historiker om Margrethes danskheds-udtalelse: - Hun har fulgt folkesj\u00e6lens bekymringer|url=http://nyheder.tv2.dk/politik/2016-10-23-historiker-om-margrethes-danskheds-udtalelse-hun-har-fulgt-folkesjaelens|accessdate=25 October 2016|publisher=[[TV2 (Denmark)]]|date=23 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"b_dk_22October2016\">{{cite news|title=Dronning Margrethe om integration: \"Det er ikke en naturlov, at man bliver dansker af at bo i Danmark\"|url=http://www.b.dk/politiko/dronning-margrethe-om-integration-det-er-ikke-en-naturlov-at-man-bliver-dans|accessdate=25 October 2016|newspaper=[[Berlingske Tidende]]|date=22 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life and interests==\n\nThe official residences of the Queen are [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen and [[Fredensborg Palace]].

Her illustrations\u2014under the pseudonym Ingahild Grathmer\u2014were used for Danish editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', which she was encouraged to illustrate in the early 1970s. She sent them to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] who was struck by the similarity of her drawings to his own style. Margrethe's drawings were redrawn by the British artist [[Eric Fraser (illustrator)|Eric Fraser]] in the translation published in 1977 and re-issued in 2002. In 2000, she illustrated Henrik, the Prince Consort's [[Cantabile (book)|poetry collection ''Cantabile'']].

There is something endearing about people who give themselves up completely to their faith. But there is likewise something frightening about such a totality, which also is a feature of Islam. A counterbalance has to be found, and one has to, at times, run the risk of having unflattering labels placed on you. For there are some things for which one should display no tolerance.

It opened in November 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wes-group.com/news.html |title=News from Worldwide |publisher=Worldwide Exhibition Specialists Ltd. |accessdate=11 July 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080315144211/http://www.wes-group.com/news.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 15 March 2008}}</ref> In May 2008 it was acquired by [[Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company]]. Phase II of development, which included building London's first International Convention Centre (ICC) and creating an \"eastern arrival experience\", was completed on 1 May 2010. In 2015 ExCeL announced the opening of CentrEd at ExCeL,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://excel.london/centred|title=ExCeL|website=excel.london|access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref> a dedicated training and meeting space located close to the western entrance of the venue overlooking Royal Victoria Dock, adding to ExCeL's wide range of flexible spaces.\n\nThe Royal Victoria Dock closed to commercial traffic in 1981, but it is still accessible to shipping. The Centre's waterfront location allows visiting vessels to moor alongside the Centre. For example, the 2005 [[London Boat Show]] was visited by [[HMS Sutherland (F81)|HMS ''Sutherland'']].\n\nThe exhibition building itself consists of two column-free, rectangular, subdivisible halls of approximately 479,493 square feet (approximately 44,546 m\u00b2) each, on either side of a central boulevard containing catering facilities and information points. There are also three sets of function rooms, one overlooking the water, another above the western end of the central boulevard, and the third on the north side of the building. These are used for smaller meetings, seminars, presentations and corporate hospitality. There are six hotels, more than 30 bars and restaurants, and 3,700 parking spaces on the campus.\n\nExCeL London has hosted numerous consumer and trade, private and public events, including exhibitions, conferences, concerts, weddings and religious events. Among these have been [[WorldSkills London 2011]], the [[London Boat Show]], the [[British International Motor Show]], [[Grand Designs]] Live, the Carole Nash MCN Motorcycle Show, [[MCM London Comic Con]], the London International Music Show, [[Star Wars Celebration]] Europe, [[London Marathon]] registration, the [[World Travel Market]], [[The Clothes Show]] London, [[DSEi|Defence Security and Equipment International (DSEi)]], The Dive Show, the [[Global Peace and Unity|Global Peace and Unity Event]], the [[2009 G-20 London Summit]], [[IP Expo]] Europe and Summer in the City.\n\nIn 2011 ExCeL London was awarded the Business Superbrand.<ref>http://www.superbrands.uk.com/excellondon {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113060335/http://www.superbrands.uk.com/excellondon |date=13 November 2011 }}</ref> The site welcomed its 20 millionth visitor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://accessaa.co.uk/prize-package-given-to-excels-20-millionth-visitor/|title=Prize package given to Excel's 20 millionth visitor|date=18 June 2014}}</ref> on 18 June 2014.

From 2021 the western entrance of ExCeL will also be served by the [[Crossrail|Elizabeth Line]], better known as Crossrail, connecting the venue to central London in just 12 minutes<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://excel.london/crossrail|title=ExCeL|website=excel.london|access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref> and providing a direct link to [[Heathrow Airport]].\n\nThe eastern entrance is connected to [[Prince Regent DLR station|Prince Regent]] station. The eastern entrance serves the International Convention Centre (ICC at ExCeL), which was opened in 2010 by then-Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] and is the London's first and currently only ICC. During major shows with large visitor attendances, extra shuttle trains are run between the venue and [[Canning Town station|Canning Town]] station, with interchange at Canning Town station to [[London Underground]]'s [[Jubilee line]]. \nExCeL London is located near [[London City Airport DLR station|London City Airport]] station. The DLR and a number of dual-carriageway roads connect the centre to the airport and the important nearby office-and-commercial district of [[Canary Wharf]].\nSince June 2012, the [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|Emirates Air Line cable car]] now links ExCeL to [[The O2|The O<sub>2</sub>]] on the [[Greenwich Peninsula]].\n\n== Sustainability and CSR ==\nExCeL London participates in the UN Global Compact Scheme,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants/3579|title=ExCeL London {{!}} UN Global Compact|website=www.unglobalcompact.org|access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref> the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative which invites companies to align with universal principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.

Phase II of development, which included building London's first International Convention Centre (ICC) and creating an \"eastern arrival experience\", was completed on 1 May 2010. In 2015 ExCeL announced the opening of CentrEd at ExCeL,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://excel.london/centred|title=ExCeL|website=excel.london|access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref> a dedicated training and meeting space located close to the western entrance of the venue overlooking Royal Victoria Dock, adding to ExCeL's wide range of flexible spaces.\n\nThe Royal Victoria Dock closed to commercial traffic in 1981, but it is still accessible to shipping. The Centre's waterfront location allows visiting vessels to moor alongside the Centre. For example, the 2005 [[London Boat Show]] was visited by [[HMS Sutherland (F81)|HMS ''Sutherland'']].\n\nThe exhibition building itself consists of two column-free, rectangular, subdivisible halls of approximately 479,493 square feet (approximately 44,546 m\u00b2) each, on either side of a central boulevard containing catering facilities and information points. There are also three sets of function rooms, one overlooking the water, another above the western end of the central boulevard, and the third on the north side of the building. These are used for smaller meetings, seminars, presentations and corporate hospitality. There are six hotels, more than 30 bars and restaurants, and 3,700 parking spaces on the campus.\n\nExCeL London has hosted numerous consumer and trade, private and public events, including exhibitions, conferences, concerts, weddings and religious events. Among these have been [[WorldSkills London 2011]], the [[London Boat Show]], the [[British International Motor Show]], [[Grand Designs]] Live, the Carole Nash MCN Motorcycle Show, [[MCM London Comic Con]], the London International Music Show, [[Star Wars Celebration]] Europe, [[London Marathon]] registration, the [[World Travel Market]], [[The Clothes Show]] London, [[DSEi|Defence Security and Equipment International (DSEi)]], The Dive Show, the [[Global Peace and Unity|Global Peace and Unity Event]], the [[2009 G-20 London Summit]], [[IP Expo]] Europe and Summer in the City.\n\nIn 2011 ExCeL London was awarded the Business Superbrand.<ref>http://www.superbrands.uk.com/excellondon {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113060335/http://www.superbrands.uk.com/excellondon |date=13 November 2011 }}</ref> The site welcomed its 20 millionth visitor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://accessaa.co.uk/prize-package-given-to-excels-20-millionth-visitor/|title=Prize package given to Excel's 20 millionth visitor|date=18 June 2014}}</ref> on 18 June 2014.

From 2021 the western entrance of ExCeL will also be served by the [[Crossrail|Elizabeth Line]], better known as Crossrail, connecting the venue to central London in just 12 minutes<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://excel.london/crossrail|title=ExCeL|website=excel.london|access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref> and providing a direct link to [[Heathrow Airport]].\n\nThe eastern entrance is connected to [[Prince Regent DLR station|Prince Regent]] station. The eastern entrance serves the International Convention Centre (ICC at ExCeL), which was opened in 2010 by then-Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] and is the London's first and currently only ICC. During major shows with large visitor attendances, extra shuttle trains are run between the venue and [[Canning Town station|Canning Town]] station, with interchange at Canning Town station to [[London Underground]]'s [[Jubilee line]]. \nExCeL London is located near [[London City Airport DLR station|London City Airport]] station. The DLR and a number of dual-carriageway roads connect the centre to the airport and the important nearby office-and-commercial district of [[Canary Wharf]].\nSince June 2012, the [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|Emirates Air Line cable car]] now links ExCeL to [[The O2|The O<sub>2</sub>]] on the [[Greenwich Peninsula]].\n\n== Sustainability and CSR ==\nExCeL London participates in the UN Global Compact Scheme,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants/3579|title=ExCeL London {{!}} UN Global Compact|website=www.unglobalcompact.org|access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref> the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative which invites companies to align with universal principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.

The series was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The series went on to develop a [[cult following]], thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on [[Teletoon]]'s Teletoon Unleashed block; [[Cartoon Network]]'s popular late-night programming block [[Adult Swim]]; and Too Funny To Sleep, a late-night programming block on [[TBS (TV Network)|TBS]]. ''Mission Hill'' was formerly known as ''The Downtowners'', although [[MTV]]'s production of the similarly titled ''[[Downtown (TV series)|Downtown]]'' forced a name change.\n\nIt has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Latin America]], Spain and [[New Zealand]].\nStylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, [[neon]] color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional \"cartoonish\" drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot in pain). The style was made to be reminiscent of Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1930s to 1950s, as well as 1960's [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons. The designs were done by [[Lauren MacMullan]], who cites the comic series ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' as her source of inspiration for her overall design.\n\nThe series was created in 1997<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/6/16256458/mission-hill-simpsons-bill-oakley-josh-weinstein-matt-groening</ref> by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], former executive producers of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the artistic designer was [[Lauren MacMullan]]. It features the [[voice actor|voices]] of [[Wallace Langham]], [[Scott Menville]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Vicki Lewis]], [[Nick Jameson]], [[Tom Kenny]], [[Herbert Sig\u00fcenza]], [[Jane Wiedlin]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Lisa Arch|Lisa Kushell]]. The [[theme music|theme song]] is a faster, instrumental version of \"Italian Leather Sofa\" by [[Cake (band)|Cake]].\n\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005.\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the world of teens and 20-somethings, this series follows hip 24-year-old Andy French, whose sheltered suburban teenage brother Kevin moves in with him and his roommates in a big-city loft.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Andrew \"Andy\" French ([[Wallace Langham]]) \u2013 A 24-year-old in his third consecutive \"post-college slump year.\" Andy is an aspiring cartoonist. From the pilot episode to \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Andy worked at a waterbed store where his boss was a lecherous, short, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed man who frequented strip clubs. From \"Unemployment, Part 2\" to \"Plan 9 from Mission Hill\" (and including the unproduced episodes \"Supertool\" and \"Pretty in Pink\"), Andy works as an artist at the same advertising agency as Jim. Often bored and mellow, Andy is easily annoyed by his younger brother, Kevin, though it has been shown that Andy does indeed care about him. However, he often has a habit of calling him and others \"douchebag\".\n* Kevin French ([[Scott Menville]]) \u2013 Andy's 17-year-old nerd brother. Kevin moved in with Andy when his parents left for [[Wyoming]], bringing his sheltered, suburban mindset to Mission Hill.  He hopes to attend [[Yale University]], and prides himself on his SAT scores.  He has a habit of \"bling-blonging,\" saying \"bling blong\" over and over again while doing homework to drown out any/all distractions and is prone to heavily overreact to trivial matters.\n* James \"Jim\" Kuback ([[Brian Posehn]]) \u2013 In his mid-20s, loftmate Jim has been Andy's best friend since high school. He is extremely tall and lanky, with red hair and a beard much like his voice actor, and speaks in a deep, monotone voice. Jim is a genius at all things electronic, whether it's electronic music or computers. He is mellow and able to express a wide variety of sentiments by nuancing the word \"Okay.\" Jim is a high-powered advertising agent who is paid vast amounts of money to alter marketing campaigns to appeal to [[Millennial Generation|Generation Y]].\n* Posey Tyler ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 In her mid 20s, Posey, the fourth hippie loftmate, is somewhat a flower child, and very concerned about the health and well-being of her plants. She often gives her vegetables to charity, but gets upset when they are damaged. She often speaks quickly and in a nervous tone.\n* Stogie \u2013 Andy's pet [[Golden Retriever]], who can apparently stomach anything from alcohol drinks to remote controls. At one point in the series his primary source of food was eating the couch cushions. Posey has stated that \"there are dark forces at work within him\", in the first episode.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Gus Duncz ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A [[homosexual|gay]] man in his late 60s, he owns a diner in Mission Hill. He is a very large, burly man with a short temper and is married to Wally.  According to [[audio commentary]] by the producers, Gus is based on [[Broderick Crawford]], though according to the audio commentary for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' seventh season episode, \"[[Marge Be Not Proud]],\" Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein claim the inspiration for the character was [[Lawrence Tierney]] (who voiced the Try-N-Save store detective who catches Bart shoplifting).\n* Wally Langford ([[Tom Kenny]]) \u2013 A gay man in his late 60s, Wally is a [[movie projector|projectionist]] at the local [[art film|art movie]] house.  He is based on [[David Niven]]. He enjoys cinema and ragtime music. In the episode \"I Married a Gay Man from Outer Space\", it is revealed that he directed a film in the 1950s entitled ''The Man from Pluto'' (which parodied ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''). It starred his partner Gus in the title role.\n* Natalie Leibowitz-Hernandez ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 Late 20s. Politically correct and intellectually well-endowed, Natalie is a professor of Women's Studies at the local college. Sensitive to biases in our culture, Natalie and her husband have yet to name their baby as they want it to have cultural significance reflective of their own respective cultures. She is of Jewish religion. She is a working mother who supports both \"Baby Nameless\" and her non-working \"marital partner\" Carlos. The character of Natalie was based and modeled on the writer and educator [[Lois M. Leveen]], a longtime friend of the show's creators. She auditioned for the voice of her own character, but the actress Vicki Lewis was determined to be even more \"Lois-y\" than Lois Leveen herself, and she was cast in the role instead.<ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150587298750464 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150853913870336 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n* Carlos Hernandez ([[Herbert Sig\u00fcenza]]) \u2013 Late 20s. He is a struggling Latino artist and [[stay-at-home dad]] for Baby Nameless. Unlike his wife Natalie, Carlos is a [[Christians|Christian]], his work is, at times, reminiscent of [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Bob Ross]]. He prides himself on having no discernible style. Carlos and Natalie have a pet snake as a result of an episode involving a raid on an animal testing lab.\n* Gwen ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) \u2013 Early 20s. Andy's on-and-off girlfriend, Gwen completed two years of community college before settling in Mission Hill. She met Andy working at Ron's [[Waterbed]] World. Someday she'd like to be an accomplished person who achieves her goals and makes a serious contribution to society. She likes [[The Go-Go's]].\n* Toby Mundorf ([[Josh Weinstein]]) \u2013 In his late teens and one of Kevin's best friends in Mission Hill. His overprotective mother worries a great deal about him, as he frequently suffers from allergies, asthma, and hunger. Despite his large size, he is a born coward.\n*  George Bang ([[Bill Oakley]]) \u2013 Kevin's other best friend. George works long hours after school in his father's market. George is extremely competitive in everything from taking tests to playing [[video game]]s. He shares all the same interests as his best friends and is particularly proud of owning the complete [[Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game]]. Unlike his friends Toby and Kevin, his parents don't seem to be overprotective, so he is more sarcastic and aggressive than either of them. George has an older sister named Tina who goes to Polytech. George is of Korean descent.\n* Ron ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A sleazy, immoral Armenian (though the commentary described Ron as being from a country that used to be a part of the [[Soviet Union]], which does include Armenia, but could also be any number of countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia) man and former boss of Andy (who loathes him). On \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Ron was arrested for tax evasion and his store was confiscated by the government. He has an extremely short temper and often takes his rage out on his employees.\n\n==Production==\n{{empty section|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Episodes==\nThirteen episodes of the series were produced while five more were written, but never completed. [[Traditional animation#Animatic|Animatics]] for some of these episodes were in production at the time of the series' cancellation. It was planned to put these animatics on the DVD for the series, but this never came to fruition. However, several of the animatics\u2014including a completed video animatic and synchronized audio read-through of the episode \"Pretty in Pink (Crap Gets in Your Eyes)\"\u2014have been released through various internet outlets.\n\n===Only-series (1999\u20132002)===\n{{Episode table\n|background=#7ea6e2\n|overall=\n|title=25\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|prodcode=\n|country=US\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 1\n|Title = Pilot (or The Douchebag Aspect)\n|DirectedBy = [[Lauren MacMullan]]\n|WrittenBy = [[Bill Oakley]] & [[Josh Weinstein]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|9|24}}\n|ProdCode = 3950-01\n|ShortSummary = Andy French, an aspiring cartoonist working at a waterbed store run by a sleazy, ambiguously Eastern European man named Ron, is forced to take in his annoying little brother, Kevin, after Andy's parents decide to move away to Wyoming and not take Kevin with them.\n''Music'': \"Burning Flies\" by [[Looper (band)|Looper]], \"Couldn't You Wait\" (Acoustic Version) by [[Silkworm (band)|Silkworm]], \"Don't Let the Bastards Grind You Down\" by [[The Toasters]], \"Rude Boy Rock\" by [[Lionrock]]\n| LineColor = 7ea6e2\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 2\n|Title = Andy Joins the PTA (or Great Sexpectations)\n|DirectedBy = Gary McCarver\n|WrittenBy = [[Andrew Kreisberg]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2002|5|26}} <small>(on [[Adult Swim]])</small>\n|ProdCode = 3950-02\n|ShortSummary = When Andy attends Kevin's parent-teacher conference en lieu of their mother and father, he joins the PTA in order to impress Kevin's English teacher.

Mission Hill is a diverse neighborhood in a much larger city called '''Cosmopolis'''. Cosmopolis is depicted as a large modern urban [[metropolis]] similar to New York City or Chicago. The official website states Mission Hill is a mix of [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]] in [[Boston]] (only miles away from where creator Bill Oakley went to college), Mission District in San Francisco, [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Wicker Park, Chicago|Wicker Park]] in [[Chicago]], and [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The exact location of Cosmopolis has never been revealed, as it is a mix of [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] cities. Most of the series takes place in the neighborhood of Mission Hill, although the skyscrapers of Downtown Cosmopolis are seen in the background. In the DVD commentaries, Josh Weinstein says that a large portion of the development of the series was spent developing Mission Hill into a functional, albeit fictional, city. Writers and animators worked together to create fictional advertisements, bands, foods, and even bus schedules. Boston, MA has a neighborhood called Mission Hill in the Roxbury section of the city which bears many similarities to its fictional counterpart.\n\n==Home release==\n[[Image:missionhill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DVD cover]]\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005. The collection replaced some of the original soundtracks with stock music, most glaringly \"Everybody Hurts\" by R.E.M. in the episode \"Andy vs. The Real World.\" The DVD collection also dubbed over some of the original voice tracks to remove any references to the replaced music, for example changing Andy's voice track from saying \"Gordon Lightfoot\" to \"Scott Joplin\" in the episode \"Unemployment - Part 1.\"\n\n==Awards==\n''Mission Hill'' received the 2000 Pulcinella Award for \"Best Series for All Audiences\"; the award cited the series' \"stylized design and honest approach to sexual and moral issues.\"\n\nThe series won an award from [[GLAAD]] for its positive portrayal of a gay relationship.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Animation|Comedy}}\n* [[Cult following#Cult television|Cult television]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0197148}}\n\n{{The WB Television Network}}\n\n[[Category:1990s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American LGBT-related television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1999 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2002 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American adult animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:American animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Film Roman television series]]\n[[Category:The WB original programming]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related animated series]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about families]]\n[[Category:Television series by Castle Rock Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

The series was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The series went on to develop a [[cult following]], thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on [[Teletoon]]'s Teletoon Unleashed block; [[Cartoon Network]]'s popular late-night programming block [[Adult Swim]]; and Too Funny To Sleep, a late-night programming block on [[TBS (TV Network)|TBS]]. ''Mission Hill'' was formerly known as ''The Downtowners'', although [[MTV]]'s production of the similarly titled ''[[Downtown (TV series)|Downtown]]'' forced a name change.\n\nIt has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Latin America]], Spain and [[New Zealand]].\nStylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, [[neon]] color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional \"cartoonish\" drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot in pain). The style was made to be reminiscent of Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1930s to 1950s, as well as 1960's [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons. The designs were done by [[Lauren MacMullan]], who cites the comic series ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' as her source of inspiration for her overall design.\n\nThe series was created in 1997<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/6/16256458/mission-hill-simpsons-bill-oakley-josh-weinstein-matt-groening</ref> by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], former executive producers of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the artistic designer was [[Lauren MacMullan]]. It features the [[voice actor|voices]] of [[Wallace Langham]], [[Scott Menville]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Vicki Lewis]], [[Nick Jameson]], [[Tom Kenny]], [[Herbert Siguenza]], [[Jane Wiedlin]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Lisa Arch|Lisa Kushell]]. The [[theme music|theme song]] is a faster, instrumental version of \"Italian Leather Sofa\" by [[Cake (band)|Cake]].\n\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005.\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the world of teens and 20-somethings, this series follows hip 24-year-old Andy French, whose sheltered suburban teenage brother Kevin moves in with him and his roommates in a big-city loft.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Andrew \"Andy\" French ([[Wallace Langham]]) \u2013 A 24-year-old in his third consecutive \"post-college slump year.\" Andy is an aspiring cartoonist. From the pilot episode to \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Andy worked at a waterbed store where his boss was a lecherous, short, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed man who frequented strip clubs. From \"Unemployment, Part 2\" to \"Plan 9 from Mission Hill\" (and including the unproduced episodes \"Supertool\" and \"Pretty in Pink\"), Andy works as an artist at the same advertising agency as Jim. Often bored and mellow, Andy is easily annoyed by his younger brother, Kevin, though it has been shown that Andy does indeed care about him. However, he often has a habit of calling him and others \"douchebag\".\n* Kevin French ([[Scott Menville]]) \u2013 Andy's 17-year-old nerd brother. Kevin moved in with Andy when his parents left for [[Wyoming]], bringing his sheltered, suburban mindset to Mission Hill.  He hopes to attend [[Yale University]], and prides himself on his SAT scores.  He has a habit of \"bling-blonging,\" saying \"bling blong\" over and over again while doing homework to drown out any/all distractions and is prone to heavily overreact to trivial matters.\n* James \"Jim\" Kuback ([[Brian Posehn]]) \u2013 In his mid-20s, loftmate Jim has been Andy's best friend since high school. He is extremely tall and lanky, with red hair and a beard much like his voice actor, and speaks in a deep, monotone voice. Jim is a genius at all things electronic, whether it's electronic music or computers. He is mellow and able to express a wide variety of sentiments by nuancing the word \"Okay.\" Jim is a high-powered advertising agent who is paid vast amounts of money to alter marketing campaigns to appeal to [[Millennial Generation|Generation Y]].\n* Posey Tyler ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 In her mid 20s, Posey, the fourth hippie loftmate, is somewhat a flower child, and very concerned about the health and well-being of her plants. She often gives her vegetables to charity, but gets upset when they are damaged. She often speaks quickly and in a nervous tone.\n* Stogie \u2013 Andy's pet [[Golden Retriever]], who can apparently stomach anything from alcohol drinks to remote controls. At one point in the series his primary source of food was eating the couch cushions. Posey has stated that \"there are dark forces at work within him\", in the first episode.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Gus Duncz ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A [[homosexual|gay]] man in his late 60s, he owns a diner in Mission Hill. He is a very large, burly man with a short temper and is married to Wally.  According to [[audio commentary]] by the producers, Gus is based on [[Broderick Crawford]], though according to the audio commentary for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' seventh season episode, \"[[Marge Be Not Proud]],\" Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein claim the inspiration for the character was [[Lawrence Tierney]] (who voiced the Try-N-Save store detective who catches Bart shoplifting).\n* Wally Langford ([[Tom Kenny]]) \u2013 A gay man in his late 60s, Wally is a [[movie projector|projectionist]] at the local [[art film|art movie]] house.  He is based on [[David Niven]]. He enjoys cinema and ragtime music. In the episode \"I Married a Gay Man from Outer Space\", it is revealed that he directed a film in the 1950s entitled ''The Man from Pluto'' (which parodied ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''). It starred his partner Gus in the title role.\n* Natalie Leibowitz-Hernandez ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 Late 20s. Politically correct and intellectually well-endowed, Natalie is a professor of Women's Studies at the local college. Sensitive to biases in our culture, Natalie and her husband have yet to name their baby as they want it to have cultural significance reflective of their own respective cultures. She is of Jewish religion. She is a working mother who supports both \"Baby Nameless\" and her non-working \"marital partner\" Carlos. The character of Natalie was based and modeled on the writer and educator [[Lois M. Leveen]], a longtime friend of the show's creators. She auditioned for the voice of her own character, but the actress Vicki Lewis was determined to be even more \"Lois-y\" than Lois Leveen herself, and she was cast in the role instead.<ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150587298750464 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150853913870336 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n* Carlos Hernandez ([[Herbert Siguenza]]) \u2013 Late 20s. He is a struggling Latino artist and [[stay-at-home dad]] for Baby Nameless. Unlike his wife Natalie, Carlos is a [[Christians|Christian]], his work is, at times, reminiscent of [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Bob Ross]]. He prides himself on having no discernible style. Carlos and Natalie have a pet snake as a result of an episode involving a raid on an animal testing lab.\n* Gwen ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) \u2013 Early 20s. Andy's on-and-off girlfriend, Gwen completed two years of community college before settling in Mission Hill. She met Andy working at Ron's [[Waterbed]] World. Someday she'd like to be an accomplished person who achieves her goals and makes a serious contribution to society. She likes [[The Go-Go's]].\n* Toby Mundorf ([[Josh Weinstein]]) \u2013 In his late teens and one of Kevin's best friends in Mission Hill. His overprotective mother worries a great deal about him, as he frequently suffers from allergies, asthma, and hunger. Despite his large size, he is a born coward.\n*  George Bang ([[Bill Oakley]]) \u2013 Kevin's other best friend. George works long hours after school in his father's market. George is extremely competitive in everything from taking tests to playing [[video game]]s. He shares all the same interests as his best friends and is particularly proud of owning the complete [[Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game]]. Unlike his friends Toby and Kevin, his parents don't seem to be overprotective, so he is more sarcastic and aggressive than either of them. George has an older sister named Tina who goes to Polytech. George is of Korean descent.\n* Ron ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A sleazy, immoral Armenian (though the commentary described Ron as being from a country that used to be a part of the [[Soviet Union]], which does include Armenia, but could also be any number of countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia) man and former boss of Andy (who loathes him). On \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Ron was arrested for tax evasion and his store was confiscated by the government. He has an extremely short temper and often takes his rage out on his employees.\n\n==Production==\n{{empty section|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Episodes==\nThirteen episodes of the series were produced while five more were written, but never completed. [[Traditional animation#Animatic|Animatics]] for some of these episodes were in production at the time of the series' cancellation. It was planned to put these animatics on the DVD for the series, but this never came to fruition. However, several of the animatics\u2014including a completed video animatic and synchronized audio read-through of the episode \"Pretty in Pink (Crap Gets in Your Eyes)\"\u2014have been released through various internet outlets.\n\n===Only-series (1999\u20132002)===\n{{Episode table\n|background=#7ea6e2\n|overall=\n|title=25\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|prodcode=\n|country=US\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 1\n|Title = Pilot (or The Douchebag Aspect)\n|DirectedBy = [[Lauren MacMullan]]\n|WrittenBy = [[Bill Oakley]] & [[Josh Weinstein]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|9|24}}\n|ProdCode = 3950-01\n|ShortSummary = Andy French, an aspiring cartoonist working at a waterbed store run by a sleazy, ambiguously Eastern European man named Ron, is forced to take in his annoying little brother, Kevin, after Andy's parents decide to move away to Wyoming and not take Kevin with them.\n''Music'': \"Burning Flies\" by [[Looper (band)|Looper]], \"Couldn't You Wait\" (Acoustic Version) by [[Silkworm (band)|Silkworm]], \"Don't Let the Bastards Grind You Down\" by [[The Toasters]], \"Rude Boy Rock\" by [[Lionrock]]\n| LineColor = 7ea6e2\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 2\n|Title = Andy Joins the PTA (or Great Sexpectations)\n|DirectedBy = Gary McCarver\n|WrittenBy = [[Andrew Kreisberg]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2002|5|26}} <small>(on [[Adult Swim]])</small>\n|ProdCode = 3950-02\n|ShortSummary = When Andy attends Kevin's parent-teacher conference en lieu of their mother and father, he joins the PTA in order to impress Kevin's English teacher.

Mission Hill is a diverse neighborhood in a much larger city called '''Cosmopolis'''. Cosmopolis is depicted as a large modern urban [[metropolis]] similar to New York City or Chicago. The official website states Mission Hill is a mix of [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]] in [[Boston]] (only miles away from where creator Bill Oakley went to college), Mission District in San Francisco, [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Wicker Park, Chicago|Wicker Park]] in [[Chicago]], and [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The exact location of Cosmopolis has never been revealed, as it is a mix of [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] cities. Most of the series takes place in the neighborhood of Mission Hill, although the skyscrapers of Downtown Cosmopolis are seen in the background. In the DVD commentaries, Josh Weinstein says that a large portion of the development of the series was spent developing Mission Hill into a functional, albeit fictional, city.
