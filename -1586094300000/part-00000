Its members were often called '''\u013dud\u00e1ks'''.\n\nThe party arose at a time when Slovakia was still part of [[Austria-Hungary]] and fought for democratic liberties, the independence and sovereignty of Slovakia,  and against the influence of [[liberalism]]. After the formation of [[Czechoslovakia]], the party preserved its conservative ideology, opposing [[Czechoslovakism]] and demanding Slovak autonomy. In the second half of the 1930s, the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe and the party's inability to achieve long-term political objectives caused a loss of the party's faith in democratic procedures and saw the party turn towards more radical and extremist ideologies such as fascism. \n\nAfter a merger with other parties in November 1938, which formed the '''Hlinka's Slovak People's Party \u2013 Party of Slovak National Unity''', it became the dominant party of the [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak State]]. In addition to adopting a totalitarian vision of the state, it included an openly pro-Nazi faction,{{sfn|Baka|2010}} which dominated Slovak policy between 1940 and 1942. The party chairmen were the Slovak priests [[Andrej Hlinka]] (1913\u201338) and later [[Jozef Tiso]] (1939\u201345), and its main newspapers were the ''Slovensk\u00e9 \u013eudov\u00e9 noviny'' (''Slovak People's Newspaper'', 1910\u201330), ''Slov\u00e1k'' (''The Slovak'', 1919\u201345) and ''Slovensk\u00e1 pravda'' (''The Slovak Truth'', 1936\u201345).\n\n==History==\n\n===Austria-Hungary (1905\u201318) ===\nThe creation process of the party took several years. With the exception of the short-lived [[Slovak Social Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Hungary|Slovak Social Democratic Party]] (1905\u201306), there was only one party in Austria-Hungary that specifically promoted the interests of the [[Slovaks]] at the turn of the 19th and 20th century  \u2014 the [[Slovak National Party (historical)|Slovak National Party]] (SNS). The Slovak People's movement was established within the Hungarian People's Party (''N\u00e9pp\u00e1rt'', founded in 1895) which opposed liberalism and was popular amongst the religious Slovak population. The party's program addressed several other problems of Slovak society including emigration, usury, corruption and forced [[magyarization]]. Due to the gradual shift away from these values, Slovak politicians began to form a separate group within the party. The party hierarchy reacted in November 1905 by asking its only MP, [[Franti\u0161ek Sky\u010d\u00e1k]], to sign a testimony against the Slovak program. Sky\u010d\u00e1k refused and on 5 December 1905, he published a declaration of a new political party.{{sfn|Letz|2006|p = 20}}\n\nOther personalities, among them the Catholic priest [[Andrej Hlinka]], joined the organisation in early 1906, before the Slovak National Party (S\u013dS) was officially formed on 18 March 1906 by Sky\u010d\u00e1k, Milan Hod\u017ea and A. R\u00e1th. However, following a decision in April 1906, the party contested elections as part of the Slovak National Party until 1913 in order to prevent splitting the Slovak vote. However, their programmes were nearly identical; the S\u013dS called for strong democratization and included liberal reforms such as [[freedom of speech]] and [[universal suffrage]]. Despite the frequent electoral manipulations in Hungary at that time, the S\u013dS won six deputies. and the SNS won one deputy.{{sfn|Letz|2006|p = 22}} out of the 415 deputies of the Hungarian Diet in the [[1906 Hungarian parliamentary election|1906 parliamentary elections]]. The Hungarian government immediately reacted by implementing increasingly repressive measures to suppress the national and political consciousness and awareness of Slovaks.{{sfn|Letz|2006|p = 22}}\n\nIn 1912, the S\u013dS refused to support the strong [[Czechoslovakism|Czechoslovakist]] orientation of the SNS prevailing at that time, and made a similar declaration as in 1905, again without formal effects. On 19 July 1913, the S\u013dS became a separate political party with Hlinka as chairman and Ferdi\u0161 Juriga and Sky\u010d\u00e1k amongst its leadership. During [[World War I]], the S\u013dS (just like the SNS) went into abeyance in order to prevent any possible pretext for accusations of activities against the Austro-Hungarian state. In 1918, Hlinka and Juriga staunchly supported the idea of a common Czechoslovak state and signed the [[Martin Declaration]] which rejected Hungarian jurisdiction and rule over Slovakia. The party participated in the creation of the Second Slovak National Council that existed from October 1918 to January 1919 and its leaders helped to consolidate the situation in Czechoslovakia during the first weeks of its existence.\n\n===First Czechoslovak Republic (1918\u201338)===\nAfter the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the S\u013dS renewed its activities on 19 December 1918 in [[\u017dilina]]. On 17 October 1925, it was renamed the '''Hlinka's Slovak People's Party''' (HS\u013dS) to distinguish it from the [[Christian and Democratic Union \u2013 Czechoslovak People's Party|Czechoslovak People's Party]]. During the majority of the whole interwar period, the HS\u013dS was the most popular party in Slovakia and until 1938, was a standard part of the democratic political spectrum. The party operated mostly in opposition but not as a destructive power and remained loyal to Czechoslovakia.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012|p=275}} All of its programs had religious, national, social and constitutional values, its ideology was based on papal [[encyclicals]] [[Rerum novarum]] and [[Quadragesimo anno]], and was oriented mostly towards its [[Catholic]] electorate. The party rejected [[economic liberalism]] and the theory of  [[class struggle]]  popular among [[socialism|socialists]] and [[communism|communists]], who were (together with liberal [[Atheism|atheists]]) considered to be the party's main enemies. The constitutional part of its program was derived from the [[Pittsburgh Agreement]] which promised an autonomous status of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia. The HS\u013dS opposed centralism and ethnic [[Czechoslovakism]] (i.e. not considering Slovaks a separate and distinctive ethnicity from the Czechs). In addition to its program, the popularity of the party was maintained by Hlinka's charisma and cult of personality.\n\nIn the [[1920 Czechoslovak parliamentary election|1920 parliamentary elections]] the party participated together with the [[Czechs|Czech]] [[Czechoslovak People's Party|People's Party]] under the name ''Czechoslovak People's Party''. The alliance received 17.5% of the vote in Slovakia, making it the third largest party. Following the elections, Hlinka stated that he would \"work 24 hours a day until Slovakia turns from a red Slovakia into a white and Christian Slovakia.\" The majority of the party's support came from Slovak farmers, mainly because the party criticized the land reforms of 1920\u20131929.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\nAfter the county elections in 1923, the party became the largest party in Slovakia, receiving 34.4% of the vote in the [[1925 Czechoslovakian parliamentary election|1925 parliamentary elections]]. In 1923, the HS\u013dS founded the paramilitary [[Rodobrana]] organization to protect their meetings. Rodobrana was influenced and manipulated by [[Vojtech Tuka]] for his own anti-Czechoslovak intentions{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012|p=277}} and later it was banned by the Czechoslovak government for anti-constitutional activities. Rodobrana was inspired by [[Italian fascism]] and became a magnet for young dissatisfied radicals, the core of the future fascist wing of the HS\u013dS. The HS\u013dS leadership attempted to bring Rodobrana under party control and succeeded when its activities were restored in 1926.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012|p=277}} Rodobrana hosted several radicals like [[Alexander Mach]] or [[J\u00e1n Farka\u0161]].{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\nOn 15 January 1927, the HS\u013dS became a member of the Czechoslovak government coalition after [[Jozef Tiso]] started negotiations during a foreign trip by Hlinka. The party held the Ministry of Health ([[Jozef Tiso]]) and Ministry of the Unification of Laws and State Administration ([[Marek Ga\u017e\u00edk]]). After a controversial trial against the HS\u013dS member [[Vojtech Tuka]], who was accused of [[high treason]], the HS\u013dS left the government on 8 October 1929.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\nIn order to contest the [[1935 Czechoslovak parliamentary election|1935 elections]], the HS\u013dS joined with the SNS to create the \"Autonomous Block\", which received 30.12% of the vote in the Slovak region of Czechoslovakia. However, it was dissolved after the elections. The HS\u013dS considered itself to be the only political party that vigorously defended Slovak national interests, but its inability to achieve autonomy decreased the prestige of its moderate wing and strengthened its radical members.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\nAfter the death of the 74-year old Hlinka in August 1938, the presidium of the party decided that the post of chairman would remain unoccupied. The party was subsequently led by vice-chairman [[Jozef Tiso]] until October 1939, when he became the new chairman. During the Czechoslovak crisis between the spring and fall of 1938, the HS\u013dS retained a common Czechoslovak platform. The party officially supported anti-German mobilizations and rejected the appeals of the [[Sudeten German Party]] to radicalize its position.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\n===Second Czechoslovak Republic (1938\u201339)===\nThe situation dramatically changed in the fall of 1938. On October 6, 1938, after the Czech region of Czechoslovakia had lost its border regions to Germany after the [[Munich Agreement]], the executive committee of the HS\u013dS together with most other Slovak parties declared the [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia. The [[Prague]] government accepted this declaration, and appointed [[Jozef Tiso]] as the Prime Minister of Autonomous Slovakia on the same day. The HS\u013dS became the dominant party in the subsequent Slovak governments. After the declaration of autonomy, internal tension between the Catholic conservative and radical fascist wings continued to grow. The conservative wing led by Tiso preserved its majority in the presidium of the party, but the radicals in turn gained influence and held important positions in new organizations like the [[Hlinka Guard]] (''Hlinkova Garda'') and the Slovak National Committees (''Slovensk\u00e9 N\u00e1rodn\u00e9 V\u00fdbory'').{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\nOn November 8, 1938, after the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia had lost one third of its territory to [[Hungary]] through the [[First Vienna Award]] (Vienna Arbitration), the Slovak branches of all parties except the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communists]] and [[Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] merged with the HS\u013dS and formed the Hlinka's Slovak People's Party \u2013 Party of Slovak National Unity (HS\u013dS-SSNJ). The Slovak National Party joined the HS\u013dS-SSNJ coalition on December 15, 1938.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\nThis new party quickly developed clearly authoritarian characteristics.  It immediately subjected the [[leftist]] and [[Jewish]] parties to considerable harassment. In the December 1938 Slovak general election, the HS\u013dS-SSNJ coalition  won 97.3% of the vote, out of which 72% went to candidates of the original HS\u013dS.  The Social Democrats and Communists were shut out because the HS\u013dS-SSNJ government refused to publish new election procedures until it was too late for these parties to select their candidates.  As of January 31, 1939, all parties except for the HS\u013dS-SSNJ, the [[German Party (Slovakia)|German Party]] and the [[Unified Magyar Party]] (Representing the Hungarian minority) were prohibited.  For all intents and purposes, Slovakia was now effectively a one-party state.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\n===First Slovak Republic (1939\u201345)===\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to save the country, the Prague government deposed Tiso as Slovak premier, replacing him with Karel Sidor.  A few days later, amid massive German provocations, Hitler invited Tiso to [[Berlin]] and urged him to proclaim Slovakia's independence.  Hitler added that if Tiso didn't do so, he would have no interest in Slovakia's fate.  During the meeting, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] passed on a bogus report stating that Hungarian troops were approaching Slovak borders. Tiso refused to make such a decision himself on the situation.  After that, he was allowed by Hitler to organize a meeting of the Slovak parliament which would approve Slovakia's declaration of independence from Czechoslovakia.{{sfn|Baka|2010}}\n\nOn 14 March, the Slovak parliament convened and heard Tiso's report on his discussion with Hitler as well as a declaration of independence.  Some of the deputies were sceptical of making such a move, but the debate was quickly quashed when Franz Karmasin, leader of the German minority in Slovakia, stated that any delay in declaring independence would result in Slovakia being partitioned between Hungary and Germany.  Under these circumstances, the legislative chamber unanimously declared Slovak independence. Jozef Tiso was appointed the first Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic.  The next day, Tiso sent a telegram, which had actually been composed the previous day in Berlin, asking the Reich to take over the protection of the newly created state.  The request was readily accepted.{{sfn|Baka|2010}}\n\nThe HS\u013dS-SSNJ was the dominant force in the country, to the point that the parliamentary elections scheduled for 1943 did not take place, and it claimed to represent the nation and the social interests of all Slovak citizens.{{sfn|Baka|2010}} Historians describe the party as a ''\"fascist and clerical nationalist group with ties to Nazism\"''.<ref>Yehuda Bauer, American Jewry and the Holocaust: the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, 1939\u20141945, Wayne State University Press, 1981, p. 356.

The conservative wing led by the Catholic priest [[Jozef Tiso]], the president of Slovakia and chairman of the party, wanted to create a separate authoritarian and religious state modelled on fundamentalist Christian principles. The conservative  wing had no doubts about the need to build a totalitarian state, but wished to do so gradually, preserving  legal and personal continuity with the previous regime.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=101}} The radicals, who preferred the methods and theory of [[National Socialism]], were fervent [[antisemites]], wanted to remove all [[Czechs]] and [[Hungarians]] from the country, and intended to create a radically nationalistic and corporatist state modelled on Adolf Hitler's [[Nazi Germany]]. Their main organization was the [[Hlinka Guard]], which was controlled by the HS\u013dS-SSNJ. The main representatives of the radical pro-Nazi faction were [[Vojtech Tuka]] and [[Alexander Mach]].{{sfn|Kamenec|2013}}\n\nIn the spring of 1940, the conservative wing was close to victory over the radicals, especially when Tiso pacified the [[Hlinka Guard]] through organizational changes and bound it closer to the party's leadership.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=101}} However, at the July 1940 [[Salzburg Conference]], the Government of Germany forced changes of personnel in the Slovak government and thus reinforced the radicals. The radical wing then held the most important positions of executive power. {{sfn|Kamenec|2013}}\n\nThe new Prime Minister, Vojtech Tuka, also became the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Alexander Mach then once again became the leader of the Hlinka Guard and also the Minister of the Interior. Tiso changed his tactics and verbally adopted the idea of national socialism, but maneuvered and stated that it had to be implemented in \"folk and Christian spirit\".{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=107}}\n\nIn the fall of 1940, the conservative wing began taking the initiative. Tiso reduced the already weak competencies of the Slovak Parliament, and strongly rejected a proposal to replace four conservative ministers with radical national socialists. In early 1941, his faction silently thwarted a pro-Nazi coup attempt.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=107}} On the other hand, Tiso allowed the radicals to take the initiative on the solution of the [[Final Solution to the Jewish Question|\"Jewish Question\"]], wrongly assuming that he can redirect all responsibility for the Holocaust to them, and later on he publicly advocated the deportations of Jews into concentration camps in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013}}\n\nThe struggle between the party's wings ended in the summer 1942 with the victory of the conservatives. Some radicals withdrew from public life, others lost their political influence or switched to the winning side, such as Alexander Mach. Due to pragmatic reasons, HSLS adopted the [[F\u00fchrerprinzip]],  with a completely different purpose than in Germany, which was the preventive elimination of radicals without angering the German government.{{sfn|Letz|2006|p = 94}} Germany naturally sympathized with the pro-Nazi radicals but allowed their opponents to win regardless. The reason was purely pragmatic - Nazi foreign policy was more interested in a consolidated Slovakia as a model of an effective satellite state and the conservative wing was more popular amongst the Slovak  population and was widely perceived as being more qualified to manage the state. Germany however never stopped supporting the radicals and frequently utilized them to pressure the Slovak puppet state.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=113}} \n\nAfter the German occupation of Slovakia in 1944 and the outbreak of the [[Slovak National Uprising]], the insurgent Slovak National Council (''Slovensk\u00e1 n\u00e1rodn\u00e1 rada'' or the SNR) declared the restoration of Czechoslovakia. On September 1, 1944, the SNR banned the HS\u013dS and all of its organisations such as the  [[Hlinka Guard]] and [[Hlinka Youth]], and confiscated their property. Although the uprising was later violently suppressed, HS\u013dS never fully regained its authority. The party ceased to exist after the liberation of Slovakia by Czechoslovak troops and by the [[Red Army]] in April\u2013May 1945. Many of the party's members were prosecuted for war crimes during the Communist regime.{{sfn|Letz|2006|p = 105}}\n\n==Names==\n*1905\u20131925: '''Slovak People's Party''' (Slovensk\u00e1 \u013eudov\u00e1 strana, short '''S\u013dS''')\n*1925\u20131938: '''Hlinka's Slovak People's Party''' (Hlinkova slovensk\u00e1 \u013eudov\u00e1 strana, short '''HS\u013dS''')\n*1938\u20131945: '''Hlinka's Slovak People's Party \u2013 Party of Slovak National Unity''' (Hlinkova slovensk\u00e1 \u013eudov\u00e1 strana \u2013 Strana slovenskej n\u00e1rodnej jednoty, short '''HS\u013dS-SSNJ''')\n\n==Election results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

strana}}), also known as the '''Slovak People's Party''' (''Slovensk\u00e1 \u013eudov\u00e1 strana'', S\u013dS) or the '''Hlinka Party''', was a [[far-right]] [[Clerical fascism|clerofascist]] political party with a strong [[Catholic fundamentalism|Catholic fundamentalist]] and [[authoritarian]] ideology. Its members were often called '''\u013dud\u00e1ks'''.\n\nThe party arose at a time when Slovakia was still part of [[Austria-Hungary]] and fought for democratic liberties, the independence and sovereignty of Slovakia,  and against the influence of [[liberalism]]. After the formation of [[Czechoslovakia]], the party preserved its conservative ideology, opposing [[Czechoslovakism]] and demanding Slovak autonomy. In the second half of the 1930s, the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe and the party's inability to achieve long-term political objectives caused a loss of the party's faith in democratic procedures and saw the party turn towards more radical and extremist ideologies such as fascism. \n\nAfter a merger with other parties in November 1938, which formed the '''Hlinka's Slovak People's Party \u2013 Party of Slovak National Unity''', it became the dominant party of the [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak State]]. In addition to adopting a totalitarian vision of the state, it included an openly pro-Nazi faction,{{sfn|Baka|2010}} which dominated Slovak policy between 1940 and 1942. The party chairmen were the Slovak priests [[Andrej Hlinka]] (1913\u201338) and later [[Jozef Tiso]] (1939\u201345), and its main newspapers were the ''Slovensk\u00e9 \u013eudov\u00e9 noviny'' (''Slovak People's Newspaper'', 1910\u201330), ''Slov\u00e1k'' (''The Slovak'', 1919\u201345) and ''Slovensk\u00e1 pravda'' (''The Slovak Truth'', 1936\u201345).\n\n==History==\n\n===Austria-Hungary (1905\u201318) ===\nThe creation process of the party took several years. With the exception of the short-lived [[Slovak Social Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Hungary|Slovak Social Democratic Party]] (1905\u201306), there was only one party in Austria-Hungary that specifically promoted the interests of the [[Slovaks]] at the turn of the 19th and 20th century  \u2014 the [[Slovak National Party (historical)|Slovak National Party]] (SNS). The Slovak People's movement was established within the Hungarian People's Party (''N\u00e9pp\u00e1rt'', founded in 1895) which opposed liberalism and was popular amongst the religious Slovak population. The party's program addressed several other problems of Slovak society including emigration, usury, corruption and forced [[magyarization]]. Due to the gradual shift away from these values, Slovak politicians began to form a separate group within the party. The party hierarchy reacted in November 1905 by asking its only MP, [[Franti\u0161ek Sky\u010d\u00e1k]], to sign a testimony against the Slovak program. Sky\u010d\u00e1k refused and on 5 December 1905, he published a declaration of a new political party.{{sfn|Letz|2006|p = 20}}\n\nOther personalities, among them the Catholic priest [[Andrej Hlinka]], joined the organisation in early 1906, before the Slovak National Party (S\u013dS) was officially formed on 18 March 1906 by Sky\u010d\u00e1k, Milan Hod\u017ea and A. R\u00e1th. However, following a decision in April 1906, the party contested elections as part of the Slovak National Party until 1913 in order to prevent splitting the Slovak vote. However, their programmes were nearly identical; the S\u013dS called for strong democratization and included liberal reforms such as [[freedom of speech]] and [[universal suffrage]]. Despite the frequent electoral manipulations in Hungary at that time, the S\u013dS won six deputies. and the SNS won one deputy.{{sfn|Letz|2006|p = 22}} out of the 415 deputies of the Hungarian Diet in the [[1906 Hungarian parliamentary election|1906 parliamentary elections]]. The Hungarian government immediately reacted by implementing increasingly repressive measures to suppress the national and political consciousness and awareness of Slovaks.{{sfn|Letz|2006|p = 22}}\n\nIn 1912, the S\u013dS refused to support the strong [[Czechoslovakism|Czechoslovakist]] orientation of the SNS prevailing at that time, and made a similar declaration as in 1905, again without formal effects. On 19 July 1913, the S\u013dS became a separate political party with Hlinka as chairman and Ferdi\u0161 Juriga and Sky\u010d\u00e1k amongst its leadership. During [[World War I]], the S\u013dS (just like the SNS) went into abeyance in order to prevent any possible pretext for accusations of activities against the Austro-Hungarian state. In 1918, Hlinka and Juriga staunchly supported the idea of a common Czechoslovak state and signed the [[Martin Declaration]] which rejected Hungarian jurisdiction and rule over Slovakia. The party participated in the creation of the Second Slovak National Council that existed from October 1918 to January 1919 and its leaders helped to consolidate the situation in Czechoslovakia during the first weeks of its existence.\n\n===First Czechoslovak Republic (1918\u201338)===\nAfter the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the S\u013dS renewed its activities on 19 December 1918 in [[\u017dilina]]. On 17 October 1925, it was renamed the '''Hlinka's Slovak People's Party''' (HS\u013dS) to distinguish it from the [[Christian and Democratic Union \u2013 Czechoslovak People's Party|Czechoslovak People's Party]]. During the majority of the whole interwar period, the HS\u013dS was the most popular party in Slovakia and until 1938, was a standard part of the democratic political spectrum. The party operated mostly in opposition but not as a destructive power and remained loyal to Czechoslovakia.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012|p=275}} All of its programs had religious, national, social and constitutional values, its ideology was based on papal [[encyclicals]] [[Rerum novarum]] and [[Quadragesimo anno]], and was oriented mostly towards its [[Catholic]] electorate. The party rejected [[economic liberalism]] and the theory of  [[class struggle]]  popular among [[socialism|socialists]] and [[communism|communists]], who were (together with liberal [[Atheism|atheists]]) considered to be the party's main enemies. The constitutional part of its program was derived from the [[Pittsburgh Agreement]] which promised an autonomous status of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia. The HS\u013dS opposed centralism and ethnic [[Czechoslovakism]] (i.e. not considering Slovaks a separate and distinctive ethnicity from the Czechs). In addition to its program, the popularity of the party was maintained by Hlinka's charisma and cult of personality.\n\nIn the [[1920 Czechoslovak parliamentary election|1920 parliamentary elections]] the party participated together with the [[Czechs|Czech]] [[Czechoslovak People's Party|People's Party]] under the name ''Czechoslovak People's Party''. The alliance received 17.5% of the vote in Slovakia, making it the third largest party. Following the elections, Hlinka stated that he would \"work 24 hours a day until Slovakia turns from a red Slovakia into a white and Christian Slovakia.\" The majority of the party's support came from Slovak farmers, mainly because the party criticized the land reforms of 1920\u20131929.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\nAfter the county elections in 1923, the party became the largest party in Slovakia, receiving 34.4% of the vote in the [[1925 Czechoslovakian parliamentary election|1925 parliamentary elections]]. In 1923, the HS\u013dS founded the paramilitary [[Rodobrana]] organization to protect their meetings. Rodobrana was influenced and manipulated by [[Vojtech Tuka]] for his own anti-Czechoslovak intentions{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012|p=277}} and later it was banned by the Czechoslovak government for anti-constitutional activities. Rodobrana was inspired by [[Italian fascism]] and became a magnet for young dissatisfied radicals, the core of the future fascist wing of the HS\u013dS. The HS\u013dS leadership attempted to bring Rodobrana under party control and succeeded when its activities were restored in 1926.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012|p=277}} Rodobrana hosted several radicals like [[Alexander Mach]] or [[J\u00e1n Farka\u0161]].{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\nOn 15 January 1927, the HS\u013dS became a member of the Czechoslovak government coalition after [[Jozef Tiso]] started negotiations during a foreign trip by Hlinka. The party held the Ministry of Health ([[Jozef Tiso]]) and Ministry of the Unification of Laws and State Administration ([[Marek Ga\u017e\u00edk]]). After a controversial trial against the HS\u013dS member [[Vojtech Tuka]], who was accused of [[high treason]], the HS\u013dS left the government on 8 October 1929.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\nIn order to contest the [[1935 Czechoslovak parliamentary election|1935 elections]], the HS\u013dS joined with the SNS to create the \"Autonomous Block\", which received 30.12% of the vote in the Slovak region of Czechoslovakia. However, it was dissolved after the elections. The HS\u013dS considered itself to be the only political party that vigorously defended Slovak national interests, but its inability to achieve autonomy decreased the prestige of its moderate wing and strengthened its radical members.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\nAfter the death of the 74-year old Hlinka in August 1938, the presidium of the party decided that the post of chairman would remain unoccupied. The party was subsequently led by vice-chairman [[Jozef Tiso]] until October 1939, when he became the new chairman. During the Czechoslovak crisis between the spring and fall of 1938, the HS\u013dS retained a common Czechoslovak platform. The party officially supported anti-German mobilizations and rejected the appeals of the [[Sudeten German Party]] to radicalize its position.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\n===Second Czechoslovak Republic (1938\u201339)===\nThe situation dramatically changed in the fall of 1938. On October 6, 1938, after the Czech region of Czechoslovakia had lost its border regions to Germany after the [[Munich Agreement]], the executive committee of the HS\u013dS together with most other Slovak parties declared the [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia. The [[Prague]] government accepted this declaration, and appointed [[Jozef Tiso]] as the Prime Minister of Autonomous Slovakia on the same day. The HS\u013dS became the dominant party in the subsequent Slovak governments. After the declaration of autonomy, internal tension between the Catholic conservative and radical fascist wings continued to grow. The conservative wing led by Tiso preserved its majority in the presidium of the party, but the radicals in turn gained influence and held important positions in new organizations like the [[Hlinka Guard]] (''Hlinkova Garda'') and the Slovak National Committees (''Slovensk\u00e9 N\u00e1rodn\u00e9 V\u00fdbory'').{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\nOn November 8, 1938, after the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia had lost one third of its territory to [[Hungary]] through the [[First Vienna Award]] (Vienna Arbitration), the Slovak branches of all parties except the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communists]] and [[Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] merged with the HS\u013dS and formed the Hlinka's Slovak People's Party \u2013 Party of Slovak National Unity (HS\u013dS-SSNJ). The Slovak National Party joined the HS\u013dS-SSNJ coalition on December 15, 1938.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\nThis new party quickly developed clearly authoritarian characteristics.  It immediately subjected the [[leftist]] and [[Jewish]] parties to considerable harassment. In the December 1938 Slovak general election, the HS\u013dS-SSNJ coalition  won 97.3% of the vote, out of which 72% went to candidates of the original HS\u013dS.  The Social Democrats and Communists were shut out because the HS\u013dS-SSNJ government refused to publish new election procedures until it was too late for these parties to select their candidates.  As of January 31, 1939, all parties except for the HS\u013dS-SSNJ, the [[German Party (Slovakia)|German Party]] and the [[Unified Magyar Party]] (Representing the Hungarian minority) were prohibited.  For all intents and purposes, Slovakia was now effectively a one-party state.{{sfn|Feren\u010duhov\u00e1|Zemko|2012}}\n\n===First Slovak Republic (1939\u201345)===\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to save the country, the Prague government deposed Tiso as Slovak premier, replacing him with Karel Sidor.  A few days later, amid massive German provocations, Hitler invited Tiso to [[Berlin]] and urged him to proclaim Slovakia's independence.  Hitler added that if Tiso didn't do so, he would have no interest in Slovakia's fate.  During the meeting, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] passed on a bogus report stating that Hungarian troops were approaching Slovak borders. Tiso refused to make such a decision himself on the situation.  After that, he was allowed by Hitler to organize a meeting of the Slovak parliament which would approve Slovakia's declaration of independence from Czechoslovakia.{{sfn|Baka|2010}}\n\nOn 14 March, the Slovak parliament convened and heard Tiso's report on his discussion with Hitler as well as a declaration of independence.  Some of the deputies were sceptical of making such a move, but the debate was quickly quashed when Franz Karmasin, leader of the German minority in Slovakia, stated that any delay in declaring independence would result in Slovakia being partitioned between Hungary and Germany.  Under these circumstances, the legislative chamber unanimously declared Slovak independence. Jozef Tiso was appointed the first Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic.  The next day, Tiso sent a telegram, which had actually been composed the previous day in Berlin, asking the Reich to take over the protection of the newly created state.  The request was readily accepted.{{sfn|Baka|2010}}\n\nThe HS\u013dS-SSNJ was the dominant force in the country, to the point that the parliamentary elections scheduled for 1943 did not take place, and it claimed to represent the nation and the social interests of all Slovak citizens.{{sfn|Baka|2010}} Historians describe the party as a ''\"fascist and clerical nationalist group with ties to Nazism\"''.<ref>Yehuda Bauer, American Jewry and the Holocaust: the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, 1939\u20141945, Wayne State University Press, 1981, p. 356.

The conservative wing led by the Catholic priest [[Jozef Tiso]], the president of Slovakia and chairman of the party, wanted to create a separate authoritarian and religious state modelled on fundamentalist Christian principles. The conservative  wing had no doubts about the need to build a totalitarian state, but wished to do so gradually, preserving  legal and personal continuity with the previous regime.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=101}} The radicals, who preferred the methods and theory of [[National Socialism]], were fervent [[antisemites]], wanted to remove all [[Czechs]] and [[Hungarians]] from the country, and intended to create a radically nationalistic and corporatist state modelled on Adolf Hitler's [[Nazi Germany]]. Their main organization was the [[Hlinka Guard]], which was controlled by the HS\u013dS-SSNJ. The main representatives of the radical pro-Nazi faction were [[Vojtech Tuka]] and [[Alexander Mach]].{{sfn|Kamenec|2013}}\n\nIn the spring of 1940, the conservative wing was close to victory over the radicals, especially when Tiso pacified the [[Hlinka Guard]] through organizational changes and bound it closer to the party's leadership.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=101}} However, at the July 1940 [[Salzburg Conference]], the Government of Germany forced changes of personnel in the Slovak government and thus reinforced the radicals. The radical wing then held the most important positions of executive power. {{sfn|Kamenec|2013}}\n\nThe new Prime Minister, Vojtech Tuka, also became the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Alexander Mach then once again became the leader of the Hlinka Guard and also the Minister of the Interior. Tiso changed his tactics and verbally adopted the idea of national socialism, but maneuvered and stated that it had to be implemented in \"folk and Christian spirit\".{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=107}}\n\nIn the fall of 1940, the conservative wing began taking the initiative. Tiso reduced the already weak competencies of the Slovak Parliament, and strongly rejected a proposal to replace four conservative ministers with radical national socialists. In early 1941, his faction silently thwarted a pro-Nazi coup attempt.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=107}} On the other hand, Tiso allowed the radicals to take the initiative on the solution of the [[Final Solution to the Jewish Question|\"Jewish Question\"]], wrongly assuming that he can redirect all responsibility for the Holocaust to them, and later on he publicly advocated the deportations of Jews into concentration camps in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013}}\n\nThe struggle between the party's wings ended in the summer 1942 with the victory of the conservatives. Some radicals withdrew from public life, others lost their political influence or switched to the winning side, such as Alexander Mach. Due to pragmatic reasons, HSLS adopted the [[F\u00fchrerprinzip]],  with a completely different purpose than in Germany, which was the preventive elimination of radicals without angering the German government.{{sfn|Letz|2006|p = 94}} Germany naturally sympathized with the pro-Nazi radicals but allowed their opponents to win regardless. The reason was purely pragmatic - Nazi foreign policy was more interested in a consolidated Slovakia as a model of an effective satellite state and the conservative wing was more popular amongst the Slovak  population and was widely perceived as being more qualified to manage the state. Germany however never stopped supporting the radicals and frequently utilized them to pressure the Slovak puppet state.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=113}} \n\nAfter the German occupation of Slovakia in 1944 and the outbreak of the [[Slovak National Uprising]], the insurgent Slovak National Council (''Slovensk\u00e1 n\u00e1rodn\u00e1 rada'' or the SNR) declared the restoration of Czechoslovakia. On September 1, 1944, the SNR banned the HS\u013dS and all of its organisations such as the  [[Hlinka Guard]] and [[Hlinka Youth]], and confiscated their property. Although the uprising was later violently suppressed, HS\u013dS never fully regained its authority. The party ceased to exist after the liberation of Slovakia by Czechoslovak troops and by the [[Red Army]] in April\u2013May 1945. Many of the party's members were prosecuted for war crimes during the Communist regime.{{sfn|Letz|2006|p = 105}}\n\n==Names==\n*1905\u20131925: '''Slovak People's Party''' (Slovensk\u00e1 \u013eudov\u00e1 strana, short '''S\u013dS''')\n*1925\u20131938: '''Hlinka's Slovak People's Party''' (Hlinkova slovensk\u00e1 \u013eudov\u00e1 strana, short '''HS\u013dS''')\n*1938\u20131945: '''Hlinka's Slovak People's Party \u2013 Party of Slovak National Unity''' (Hlinkova slovensk\u00e1 \u013eudov\u00e1 strana \u2013 Strana slovenskej n\u00e1rodnej jednoty, short '''HS\u013dS-SSNJ''')\n\n==Election results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
