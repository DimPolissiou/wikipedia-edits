As for the city, which extended to the north and east of the castle, it now, with the exception of a few [[Course (architecture)|courses]] still upright, presents nothing but a heap of ruins.'</ref> while in 1882 the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s ''Survey of Western Palestine''  described Taibe  as: \"A straggling village, of moderate size, lying on flat ground, and containing several good stone houses.

{"title_page": "Credit score", "text_new": "{{About|an individual's credit score|organization's credit rating|credit rating}}\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2011}}\nA '''credit score''' is a numerical expression based on a level analysis of a person's credit files, to represent the [[creditworthiness]] of an individual. A credit score is primarily based on a [[credit report]], information typically sourced from [[credit bureau]]s.\n\nLenders, such as [[bank]]s and credit card companies, use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to [[bad debt]].  Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what [[interest rate]], and what credit limits.  Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue. The use of credit or [[identity scoring]] prior to authorizing access or granting credit is an implementation of a [[trusted system]].\n\nCredit scoring is not limited to banks. Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, insurance companies, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques. Digital finance companies such as online lenders also use alternative data sources to calculate the creditworthiness of borrowers.\n\n==By country==\n\n===Australia===\n\nIn Australia, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.\n\nAlthough [[logistic function|logistic]] (or [[non-linear]]) probability modelling is still the most popular means by which to develop scorecards, various other methods offer powerful alternatives, including [[Multivariate adaptive regression splines|MARS]], [[Predictive analytics#Classification and regression trees|CART]], [[CHAID]], and [[random forest]]s.\n\nPrior to 12 March 2014 [[Veda Advantage]], the main provider of credit file data, provided only a negative credit reporting system containing information on applications for credit and adverse listings indicating a default under a credit contract. Veda was acquired by Equifax in Feb 2016,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.equifax.com.au/news-media/equifax-completes-acquisition-australias-leading-credit-information-company-veda-group|title=Equifax Completes Acquisition of Australia\u2019s Leading Credit Information Company, Veda Group Limited, for Total Consideration of USD$1.9 Billion|date=25 February 2016|work=Equifax Australia|access-date=6 March 2018|language=en}}</ref> making Equifax the largest credit agency in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/52.%20Overview%3A%20Credit%20Reporting/credit-reporting-agencies|title=Credit reporting agencies|last=Anonymous|date=17 August 2010|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the subsequent introduction of positive reporting, lending companies have begun an uptake of its usage with some implementing [[Risk-based pricing|risk based pricing]] to set lending rates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McGeorge|first1=Noah|title=fico ratings|url=https://aaacreditguide.com/fico-credit-score-range/|accessdate=28 February 2013|agency=Barff|issue=Atlanta|publisher=Marcus Arnold}}</ref>\n\n===Austria===\nIn [[Austria]], credit scoring is done as a blacklist. Consumers who did not pay bills end up on the blacklists that are held by different [[credit bureau]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksv.at/KSV/1870/de/4privatpersonen/4fragenantworten/index.html |title=Fragen & Antworten |accessdate=31 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101180603/http://www.ksv.at/KSV/1870/de/4privatpersonen/4fragenantworten/index.html |archive-date=1 January 2011 |df= }}</ref> Having an entry on the black list may result in the denial of contracts. Certain enterprises including telecom carriers use the list on a regular basis. Banks also use these lists, but rather inquire about security and income when considering loans. Beside these lists several agencies and credit bureaus provide credit scoring of consumers.\n\nAccording to the [[Data Protection Directive|Austrian Data Protection Act]], consumers must opt-in for the use of their private data for any purpose. Consumers can also withhold permission to use the data later, making illegal any further distribution or use of the collected data.<ref>\u00a7 8 Abs 1 Z2 DSG</ref> Consumers also have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year.<ref>\u00a7 26 DSG</ref> Wrong or unlawfully collected data must be deleted or corrected.<ref>\u00a7\u00a7 27 and 28 DSG</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\nCredit scoring is relatively new in Brazil. Previously, credit reporting was done as a blacklist and each lender used to assess potential borrowers on their own criteria. Nowadays, the system of credit reports and scores in Brazil is very similar to that in the United States.\n\nA credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit information, which represents the creditworthiness of that person. It is the most important tool used by financial institutions during a credit analysis that aims to assist the decision-making process of granting credit and conducting business, in order to verify the likelihood that people will pay their bills. A credit score is primarily based on credit report information, typically from one of the three major credit bureaus: [[Experian|Serasa Experian]], [[:pt:Boa Vista Servi\u00e7os|Boa Vista]] (previously [[Equifax|Equifax do Brasil]]) and [[SPC Brasil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foregon.com/blog/voce-sabe-o-que-e-score/|title=Score de cr\u00e9dito: o que \u00e9 e como ele funciona|first=Leonardo|last=Jacomini|date=9 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are different methods of calculating credit scores in Brazil. In general, scores range from 0 to 1000 indicating what is the chance of a certain profile of consumers paying their bills on time in the next 12 months. The score is calculated from several factors, but practically it analyzes a person's trajectory as a consumer, what includes up to date payments of bills, history of negative debts, financial relationships with companies and updated personal data on credit protection agencies, such as Serasa Experian, Boa Vista, SPC, Quod and Foregon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.serasaconsumidor.com.br/ensina/ver-o-score-e-gratis/ |title=Tudo sobre score de cr\u00e9dito |language=es |trans-title=All about credit score |access-date=29 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529030645/https://www.serasaconsumidor.com.br/ensina/ver-o-score-e-gratis/ |archive-date=29 May 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://quickbooks.intuit.com/br/blog/conceitos-financas/entenda-como-funciona-o-score-de-credito-do-consumidor|title=Entenda Como Funciona o Score de Cr\u00e9dito do Consumidor|date=24 April 2015|website=QuickBooks}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThe system of credit reports and scores in Canada is very similar to that in the United States and India, with two of the same reporting agencies active in the country:  [[Equifax]] and [[TransUnion]]. ([[Experian]], which entered the Canadian market with the purchase of Northern Credit Bureaus in 2008, announced the closing of its Canadian operations as of 18 April 2009).\n\nThere are, however, some key differences. One is that, unlike in the United States, where a consumer is allowed only one free copy of their credit report a year, in Canada, the consumer may order a free copy of their credit report any number of times in a year, as long as the request is made in writing, and as long as the consumer asks for a printed copy to be delivered by mail.<ref>[http://www.equifax.com/ecm/canada/EFXCreditReportRequestForm.pdf Equifax form] (Canada)</ref><ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/household-finances/its-easy-to-get-a-free-credit-report-honest/article620190/ TransUnion form] (Canada)</ref> Borrowell and CreditKarma offers free credit report and credit check and this request by the consumer is noted in the credit report as a 'soft inquiry', so it has no effect on their credit score. According to Equifax's ScorePower Report, Equifax Beacon scores range from 300 to 900. Trans Union Emperica scores also range from 300 and 900.\n\nThe Government of [[Canada]] offers a free publication called ''Understanding Your Credit Report and Credit Score''.<ref>[http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/resources/publications/creditLoans/Pages/Understa-Comprend.aspx Understanding Your Credit Report and Credit Score] (Canada)</ref>  This publication provides sample credit report and credit score documents, with explanations of the notations and codes that are used. It also contains general information on how to build or improve credit history, and how to check for signs that [[identity theft]] has occurred. The publication is available online at the [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]. Paper copies can also be ordered at no charge for residents of Canada.\n\n===China===\nPrivate companies have developed credit score systems, these systems include [[Sesame Credit]], which is provided by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/16/china-social-credit-system-ant-financials-sesame-credit-and-others-give-scores-that-go-beyond-fico.html|title=FICO with Chinese characteristics: Nice rewards, but punishing penalties|last=Ming|first=Cheang|date=2017|website=CNBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tencent|Tencent Credit]]. Part of the government's [[Social Credit System]] uses credit information about citizens.\n\n===Denmark===\nThe credit scoring is widely used in Denmark by the banks and a number of private companies within telco and others. The credit scoring is split in two:\n* Private: The probability of defaulting\n* Businesses: The probability of bankruptcy\nFor privates, the credit scoring is always made by the creditor. For businesses it is either made by the creditor or by a third party.\n\nThere are a few companies who have specialized in developing credit scorecards in Denmark:\n* [[Experian]] (generic rating for business)\n* [[Bisnode]] (generic rating for business)\n\nThe credit scorecards in Denmark are mainly based on information provided by the applicant and publicly available data. It is very restricted by legislation compared to its neighbouring countries.\n\n===Germany===\n\nIn Germany, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.\n\nConsumers have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year. At present [[Schufa]], the main provider of credit file data, provides scores for about three-quarters of the German population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9343.html|title=Lecture: Court in the Akten &#124; Sunday &#124; Schedule 35th Chaos Communication Congress|website=fahrplan.events.ccc.de}}</ref>\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], there are four credit information companies licensed by [[Reserve Bank of India]]. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited ([[CIBIL]]) has functioned as a Credit Information Company from January 2001.<ref name=\"Reserve Bank of India\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5540&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> Subsequently, in 2010, [[Experian]],<ref name=\"Reserve Bank of India\"/> [[Equifax]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5598&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> and [[CRIF High Mark Credit Information Services|CRIF High Mark]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=6137&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> were given licenses by [[Reserve Bank of India]] to operate as Credit Information Companies in India.\n\nAlthough all the four credit information companies have developed their individual credit scores, the most popular is [[CIBIL]] credit score. The [[CIBIL]] credit score is a three  digit number that represents a summary of individuals' credit history and credit rating. This score ranges from 300 to 900, with 900 being the best score. Individuals with no credit history will have a score of -1. If the credit history is less than six months, the score will be 0. [[CIBIL]] credit score takes time to build up and usually it takes between 18 and 36 months or more of credit usage to obtain a satisfactory credit score.\n\n===Norway===\nIn [[Norway]], the most used, free credit scoring service is [https://defero.no Defero]. They provide their members with a full credit report with credit score, supplied by Experian. Other credit rating agencies are Bisnode, Credit Safe and Evry. Credit scoring is based on publicly available information such as demographic data, tax returns, taxable income and any ''Betalingsanmerkning'' (non-payment records) that might be registered on the credit-scored individual. Upon being scored, an individual will receive a notice (written or by e-mail) from the scoring agency stating who performed the credit score as well as any information provided in the score. In addition, many credit institutions use custom scorecards based on any number of parameters. Credit scores range between 300 and 999.\n\n===South Africa===\nCredit scoring is used throughout the credit industry in [[South Africa]], with the likes of banks, micro-lenders, clothing retailers, furniture retailers, specialized lenders and insurers all using credit scores.  Currently all four retail [[credit bureau]] offer credit bureau scores.  The data stored by the credit bureaus include both positive and negative data, increasing the predictive power of the individual scores.  [[TransUnion]] (formerly ITC) offer the Empirica Score which is, as of mid-2010, in its 4th generation.  The Empirica score is segmented into two suites: the account origination (AO) and account management (AM).  [[Experian]] South Africa likewise has a Delphi credit score with their fourth generation about to be released (late 2010). In 2011, [[Compuscan]] released Compuscore ABC, a scoring suite which predicts the probability of customer default throughout the credit life cycle. Six years later, Compuscan introduced Compuscore PSY, a 3-digit psychometric-based credit bureau score used by lenders to make informed lending decisions on thin files or marginal declines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.compuscan.co.za/introducing-newest-service-offering-compuscore-psy/|title=Introducing our newest service offering: Compuscore PSY|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nAccording to the provisions of Credit Information Bureau Act No 18 of 1990 (as amended by Act No 42 of 2008), [[Credit Information Bureau, Inc.|CRIB]] has been delegated with power to issue credit reports to any subject to whom that information is related to. The Bureau commenced to issue Self Inquiry Credit Reports in December 2009.<ref>[http://www.crib.lk/en/index.php/customer-help-desk/obtain-your-own-credit-report Crib.lk] (Sri Lanks)</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\nSweden has a system for credit scoring that aims to find people with a history of neglect to pay bills or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make payments after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish [[Enforcement Authority]] which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a ''Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning'' (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company.<ref>{{cite web|title=Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning|url=https://www.kronofogden.se/Betalningsanmarkning2.html|website=kronofogden.se|publisher=[[Enforcement Authority]]|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> This kind of nonpayment record will make it very difficult to get a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where you handle cash.

Then the party requesting the payment must show its correctness in district court. Failure to dispute is seen as admitting the debt. If the debtor loses the court trial, costs for the trial are added to the debt. Taxes and authority fees must always be paid on demand unless payment has already been made.\n\nEvery person with a Swedish [[national identification number]] must register a valid address, even if living abroad, since sent letters are considered to have been delivered to that person once they reach the registered address. As an example, Swedish astronaut [[Christer Fuglesang]] got a ''Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning'' since a car he had ordered, and therefore owned, passed a toll station for the [[Stockholm congestion tax]]. At the time, he was living in the USA training for his first [[STS-116|Space Shuttle mission]] and had an old invalid address registered for the car. Letters with payment requests did not reach him on time. The case was appealed and retracted, but the non-payment record remained for three years since it could not be retracted according to the law.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Olsson|first1=Caroline|title=Fuglesang hamnar hos kronofogden|trans-title=Fuglesang at the Swedish Enforcement Administration|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article11372512.ab|website=aftonbladet.se|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Credit scorecards}}\nCredit scoring in the United Kingdom is very different to that of the United States and other nations. There is no such thing as a universal credit score or credit rating in the UK. Each lender will assess potential borrowers on their own criteria, and these algorithms are effectively trade secrets.<ref>https://www.equifax.co.uk/resources/loans_and_credit/credit-myths-the-truth-about-credit.html</ref>\n\n\"Credit scores\" which are available for individuals to see and provided from [[Credit Reference Agencies]] such as Call Credit, [[Equifax]], [[Experian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/video/heres-what-your-credit-score-is-according-to-an-experian-executive-14819049|title=Here's What Your Credit Score Is According to an Experian Executive|first=Katherine|last=Ross|date=27 December 2018|website=TheStreet}}</ref> and [[TransUnion]] are marketed to consumers and are not usually used by lenders. Most lenders instead use their own internal scoring mechanism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe most popular statistical technique used is [[logistic regression]] to predict a binary outcome: bad debt or no bad debt.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Some banks also build regression models that predict the amount of bad debt a customer may incur. Typically this is much harder to predict, and most banks focus only on the binary outcome.\n\nCredit scoring is closely regulated only by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] when used for the purposes of the Advanced approach to Capital Adequacy under [[Basel II]] regulations.\n\nCredit scoring is closely regulated in the UK, with the industry regulator being the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). Consumers can also send complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service if they experience problems with any Credit Reference Agency.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hulland|first=Louise|title=Credit Reference Agencies|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mg74/features/credit-reference-agency|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIt is very difficult for a consumer to know in advance whether they have a high enough credit score to be accepted for credit with a given lender.  This situation is due to the complexity and structure of credit scoring, which differs from one lender to another.\n\nLenders need not reveal their credit score head, nor need they reveal the minimum credit score required for the applicant to be accepted, because there may not be such a minimum score.\n\nIf the applicant is declined for credit, the lender is not obliged to reveal the exact reason why. However industry associations including the [[Finance and Leasing Association]] oblige their members to provide a satisfactory reason. Credit-bureau data sharing agreements also require that an applicant declined based on credit-bureau data is told that this is the reason and the address of the credit bureau must be provided.\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Credit score in the United States}}\nIn the United States, a credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit files, that in theory represents the [[creditworthiness]] of that person, which is the likelihood that people will pay their bills.  A credit score is primarily based on [[credit report]] information, typically from one of the three major [[credit bureau]]s: [[Experian]], [[TransUnion]], and [[Equifax]]. Income and employment history (or lack thereof) are not considered by the major credit bureaus when calculating credit scores.\n\nThere are different methods of calculating credit scores. [[FICO score]]s, the most widely used type of credit score, is a credit score developed by [[FICO]], previously known as [[Fair Isaac|Fair Isaac Corporation]].  As of 2018, there are currently 29 different versions of FICO scores in use in the United States. Some of these versions are \"industry specific\" scores, that is, scores produced for particular market segments, including automotive lending and bankcard (credit card) lending. Industry-specific FICO scores produced for automotive lending are formulated differently than FICO scores produced for bankcard lending. Nearly every consumer will have different FICO scores depending upon which type of FICO score is ordered by a lender; for example, a consumer with several paid-in-full car loans but no reported credit card payment history will generally score better on a FICO automotive-enhanced score than on a FICO bankcard-enhanced score. FICO also produces several \"general purpose\" scores which are not tailored to any particular industry. Industry-specific FICO scores range from 250 to 900, whereas general purpose scores range from 300 to 850.\n\nFICO scores are used by many mortgage lenders that use a risk-based system to determine the possibility that the borrower may default on financial obligations to the mortgage lender. For most mortgages originated in the United States, three credit scores are obtained on a consumer: a Beacon 5.0 score (Beacon is a trademark of FICO) which is calculated from the consumer's Equifax credit history, a FICO Model II score, which is calculated from the consumer's Experian credit history, and a Classic04 score, which is calculated from the consumer's Trans Union history.\n\n[[Credit bureau]]s also often re-sell FICO scores directly to consumers, often a general-purpose FICO 8 score. Previously, the credit bureaus also sold their own credit scores which they developed themselves, and which did not require payment to FICO to utilize: [[Equifax]]'s RISK score and [[Experian]]'s PLUS score. However, as of 2018, these scores are no longer sold by the credit bureaus. Trans Union offers a Vantage 3.0 score for sale to consumers, which is a version of the [[VantageScore]] credit score. In addition, many large lenders, including the major credit card issuers, have developed their own proprietary scoring models.\n\nStudies have shown scores to be predictive of risk in the underwriting of both credit and insurance.<ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/RptCongress/creditscore/creditscore.pdf Report to the Congress on credit scoring and its effects on the availability and affordability of credit]</ref><ref name=insurance>[http://www2.ftc.gov/os/2007/07/P044804FACTA_Report_Credit-Based_Insurance_Scores.pdf Credit-based insurance scores: Impacts on consumers of automobile insurance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511204147/http://ftc.gov/os/2007/07/P044804FACTA_Report_Credit-Based_Insurance_Scores.pdf |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iii.org/media/presentations/creditscoringtexas/|title=No Evidence of Disparate Impact in Texas Due to Use of Credit Information by Personal Lines Insurers - III|author=|date=|website=iii.org}}</ref>  Some studies even suggest that most consumers are the beneficiaries of lower credit costs and insurance premiums due to the use of credit scores.<ref name=insurance/><ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2003/0203lead.pdf An overview of consumer data and credit reporting]</ref>\n\nNew credit scores have been developed in the last decade by companies such as Scorelogix, [[PRBC (company)|PRBC]], L2C, [[Innovis]] etc. which do not use bureau data to predict creditworthiness. Scorelogix's JSS Credit Score uses a different set of risk factors, such as the borrower's job stability, income, income sufficiency, and impact of economy, in predicting credit risk, and the use of such alternative credit scores is on the rise. These new types of credit scores are often combined with FICO or bureau scores to improve the accuracy of predictions. Most lenders today use some combination of bureau scores and alternative credit scores to develop better understanding of a borrower's ability to pay.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIt is widely recognized that FICO is a measure of past ability to pay. New credit scores that focus more on future ability to pay are being deployed to enhance credit risk models. L2C offers an alternative credit score that uses utility payment histories to determine creditworthiness, and many lenders use this score in addition to bureau scores to make lending decisions. Many lenders use Scorelogix's JSS score in addition to bureau scores, given that the JSS score incorporates job and income stability to determine whether the borrower will have the ability to repay debt in the future. It is thought that the FICO score will remain the dominant score, but it will likely be used in conjunction with other alternative credit scores that offer other pictures of risk.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nUsage of credit histories in employment screenings has increased from 19% in 1996 to 42% in 2006.<ref name=wernau>{{cite news|last=Wernau|first=Julie|title=TransUnion battling attempts to ban employment credit checks|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-04-28/business/ct-biz-0429-credit-checks-transunion--20100428_1_credit-checks-transunion-credit-bureaus|accessdate=23 October 2011|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=28 April 2010}}</ref>{{rp|1}}  However, credit reports for employment screening purposes do not include credit scores.<ref name=wernau />{{rp|2}}\n\nAmericans are entitled to one free credit report in every 12-month period from each of the three credit bureaus, but are not entitled to receive a free credit score. The three credit bureaus run [[Annualcreditreport.com]], where users can get their free credit reports. Credit scores are available as an add-on feature of the report for a fee. If the consumer disputes an item on a credit report obtained using the free system, under the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (FCRA), the credit bureaus have 45 days to investigate, rather than 30 days for reports obtained otherwise.<ref>[http://www.equifax.com/answers/correct-credit-report-errors/en_cp Equifax Credit Report Dispute FAQs] retrieved on 18 December 2008</ref>\n\nAlternatively, consumers wishing to obtain their credit scores can in some cases purchase them separately from the credit bureaus or can purchase their FICO score directly from [[FICO]]. Credit scores (including FICO scores) are also made available free by subscription to one of the many [[credit report monitoring]] services available from the credit bureaus or other third parties, although to actually get the scores free from most such services, one must use a credit card to sign up for a free trial subscription of the service and then cancel before the first monthly charge. Websites like [[WalletHub]], [[Credit Sesame]] and [[Credit Karma]] provide free credit scores with no credit card required, using the [[TransUnion]] VantageScore 3.0 model. Credit.com uses the [[Experian]] VantageScore 3.0 model. Until March 2009, holders of credit cards issued by [[Washington Mutual]] were offered a free FICO score each month through the bank's Web site. ([[Chase (bank)|Chase]], which took over Washington Mutual in 2008, discontinued this practice in March 2009.)<ref>[http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/cc/credit-card-update.asp Chase drops WaMu secured card, FICO score] retrieved on 17 January 2009</ref> [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] resumed the practice of offering a free FICO score in March 2010 of select card members to the exclusion of the majority of former WAMU card holders.\n\nUnder the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], a consumer is entitled to a free credit report (but not a free credit score) within 60 days of any adverse action (e.g., being denied credit, or receiving substandard credit terms from a lender) taken as a result of their credit score. Under the [[Wall Street reform]] bill passed on 22 July 2010, a consumer is entitled to receive a free credit score if they are denied a loan or insurance due to their credit score.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/07/15/president-obama-final-passage-wall-street-reform-end-bailouts-a-beginning-accountabi President Obama on Final Passage of Wall Street Reform: An End to Bailouts, a Beginning for Accountability] published 15 July 2010, retrieved on 26 July 2010.</ref>\n\nThe generic or classic FICO credit score ranges between 300 and 850. The VantageScore 3.0 score ranges from 300-850. The old VantageScore was between 501 and 990.\n\nThe first step to interpreting a score is to identify the source of the credit score and its use. There are numerous scores based on various scoring models sold to lenders and other users. The most common was created by FICO and is called FICO score. [[FICO]] is a publicly traded corporation (under the ticker symbol FICO) that created the best-known and most widely used credit score model in the United States. FICO produces scoring models which are installed at and distributed by the three largest national credit repositories in the U.S (TransUnion, Equifax and Experian) and the two national credit repositories in Canada (TransUnion Canada and Equifax Canada).  FICO controls the vast majority of the credit score market in the United States and Canada although there are several other competing players that collectively share a very small percentage of the market.\n\nIn the United States, the [[median]] generic FICO score was 723 in 2006 and 711 in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fico.com/en/blogs/tag/score-distributions/|title=Score Distributions|author=|date=|website=FICO}}</ref>  The performance definition of the FICO risk score (its stated design objective) is to predict the likelihood that a consumer will go 90 days past due or worse in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated.  The higher the consumer's score, the less likely he or she will go 90 days past due in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated.  Because different lending uses (mortgage, automobile, credit card) have different parameters, FICO algorithms are adjusted according to the predictability of that use.  For this reason, a person might have a higher credit score for a revolving credit card debt when compared to a mortgage credit score taken at the same point in time.\n\nThe interpretation of a credit score will vary by lender, industry, and the economy as a whole.  While 640 has been a divider between \"prime\" and \"subprime\", all considerations about score revolve around the strength of the economy in general and investors' appetites for risk in providing the funding for borrowers in particular when the score is evaluated.  In 2010, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) tightened its guidelines regarding credit scores to a small degree, but lenders who have to service and sell the securities packaged for sale into the secondary market largely raised their minimum score to 640 in the absence of strong compensating factors in the borrower's loan profile.  In another housing example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began charging extra for loans over 75% of the value that have scores below 740. Furthermore, private mortgage insurance companies will not even provide mortgage insurance for borrowers with scores below 660. Therefore, \"prime\" is a product of the lender's appetite for the risk profile of the borrower at the time that the borrower is asking for the loan.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nSeveral factors affect individual's credit scores. One factor is the amount an individual borrowed as compared to the amount of credit available to the individual. As an individual borrows, or leverages, more money, the individual's credit score decreases.\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\nCredit Scores in UAE are issued by AECB, a Federal Government-held company. Individual Credit Scores are three-digit numbers used to predict the likelihood of an individual making their loan and credit card payments on time, based on previous credit and payment behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moneymall.ae/credit-score/|title=Credit Score in UAE|last=|first=|date=|website=moneymall.ae|publisher='MoneyMall' leading personal finance portal in UAE|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=22 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Credit Score number in UAE ranges from 300 to 900.

A credit score is primarily based on a [[credit report]], information typically sourced from [[credit bureau]]s.\n\nLenders, such as [[bank]]s and credit card companies, use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to [[bad debt]].  Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what [[interest rate]], and what credit limits.  Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue. The use of credit or [[identity scoring]] prior to authorizing access or granting credit is an implementation of a [[trusted system]].\n\nCredit scoring is not limited to banks. Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, insurance companies, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques. Digital finance companies such as online lenders also use alternative data sources to calculate the creditworthiness of borrowers.\n\n==By country==\n\n===Australia===\n\nIn Australia, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.\n\nAlthough [[logistic function|logistic]] (or [[non-linear]]) probability modelling is still the most popular means by which to develop scorecards, various other methods offer powerful alternatives, including [[Multivariate adaptive regression splines|MARS]], [[Predictive analytics#Classification and regression trees|CART]], [[CHAID]], and [[random forest]]s.\n\nPrior to 12 March 2014 [[Veda Advantage]], the main provider of credit file data, provided only a negative credit reporting system containing information on applications for credit and adverse listings indicating a default under a credit contract.

Certain enterprises including telecom carriers use the list on a regular basis. Banks also use these lists, but rather inquire about security and income when considering loans. Beside these lists several agencies and credit bureaus provide credit scoring of consumers.\n\nAccording to the [[Data Protection Directive|Austrian Data Protection Act]], consumers must opt-in for the use of their private data for any purpose. Consumers can also withhold permission to use the data later, making illegal any further distribution or use of the collected data.<ref>\u00a7 8 Abs 1 Z2 DSG</ref> Consumers also have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year.<ref>\u00a7 26 DSG</ref> Wrong or unlawfully collected data must be deleted or corrected.<ref>\u00a7\u00a7 27 and 28 DSG</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\nCredit scoring is relatively new in Brazil. Previously, credit reporting was done as a blacklist and each lender used to assess potential borrowers on their own criteria. Nowadays, the system of credit reports and scores in Brazil is very similar to that in the United States.\n\nA credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit information, which represents the creditworthiness of that person. It is the most important tool used by financial institutions during a credit analysis that aims to assist the decision-making process of granting credit and conducting business, in order to verify the likelihood that people will pay their bills. A credit score is primarily based on credit report information, typically from one of the three major credit bureaus: [[Experian|Serasa Experian]], [[:pt:Boa Vista Servi\u00e7os|Boa Vista]] (previously [[Equifax|Equifax do Brasil]]) and [[SPC Brasil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foregon.com/blog/voce-sabe-o-que-e-score/|title=Score de cr\u00e9dito: o que \u00e9 e como ele funciona|first=Leonardo|last=Jacomini|date=9 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are different methods of calculating credit scores in Brazil. In general, scores range from 0 to 1000 indicating what is the chance of a certain profile of consumers paying their bills on time in the next 12 months. The score is calculated from several factors, but practically it analyzes a person's trajectory as a consumer, what includes up to date payments of bills, history of negative debts, financial relationships with companies and updated personal data on credit protection agencies, such as Serasa Experian, Boa Vista, SPC, Quod and Foregon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.serasaconsumidor.com.br/ensina/ver-o-score-e-gratis/ |title=Tudo sobre score de cr\u00e9dito |language=es |trans-title=All about credit score |access-date=29 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529030645/https://www.serasaconsumidor.com.br/ensina/ver-o-score-e-gratis/ |archive-date=29 May 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://quickbooks.intuit.com/br/blog/conceitos-financas/entenda-como-funciona-o-score-de-credito-do-consumidor|title=Entenda Como Funciona o Score de Cr\u00e9dito do Consumidor|date=24 April 2015|website=QuickBooks}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThe system of credit reports and scores in Canada is very similar to that in the United States and India, with two of the same reporting agencies active in the country:  [[Equifax]] and [[TransUnion]]. ([[Experian]], which entered the Canadian market with the purchase of Northern Credit Bureaus in 2008, announced the closing of its Canadian operations as of 18 April 2009).\n\nThere are, however, some key differences. One is that, unlike in the United States, where a consumer is allowed only one free copy of their credit report a year, in Canada, the consumer may order a free copy of their credit report any number of times in a year, as long as the request is made in writing, and as long as the consumer asks for a printed copy to be delivered by mail.<ref>[http://www.equifax.com/ecm/canada/EFXCreditReportRequestForm.pdf Equifax form] (Canada)</ref><ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/household-finances/its-easy-to-get-a-free-credit-report-honest/article620190/ TransUnion form] (Canada)</ref> Borrowell and CreditKarma offers free credit report and credit check and this request by the consumer is noted in the credit report as a 'soft inquiry', so it has no effect on their credit score. According to Equifax's ScorePower Report, Equifax Beacon scores range from 300 to 900. Trans Union Emperica scores also range from 300 and 900.\n\nThe Government of [[Canada]] offers a free publication called ''Understanding Your Credit Report and Credit Score''.<ref>[http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/resources/publications/creditLoans/Pages/Understa-Comprend.aspx Understanding Your Credit Report and Credit Score] (Canada)</ref>  This publication provides sample credit report and credit score documents, with explanations of the notations and codes that are used. It also contains general information on how to build or improve credit history, and how to check for signs that [[identity theft]] has occurred. The publication is available online at the [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]. Paper copies can also be ordered at no charge for residents of Canada.\n\n===China===\nPrivate companies have developed credit score systems, these systems include [[Sesame Credit]], which is provided by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/16/china-social-credit-system-ant-financials-sesame-credit-and-others-give-scores-that-go-beyond-fico.html|title=FICO with Chinese characteristics: Nice rewards, but punishing penalties|last=Ming|first=Cheang|date=2017|website=CNBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tencent|Tencent Credit]]. Part of the government's [[Social Credit System]] uses credit information about citizens.\n\n===Denmark===\nThe credit scoring is widely used in Denmark by the banks and a number of private companies within telco and others. The credit scoring is split in two:\n* Private: The probability of defaulting\n* Businesses: The probability of bankruptcy\nFor privates, the credit scoring is always made by the creditor. For businesses it is either made by the creditor or by a third party.\n\nThere are a few companies who have specialized in developing credit scorecards in Denmark:\n* [[Experian]] (generic rating for business)\n* [[Bisnode]] (generic rating for business)\n\nThe credit scorecards in Denmark are mainly based on information provided by the applicant and publicly available data. It is very restricted by legislation compared to its neighbouring countries.\n\n===Germany===\n\nIn Germany, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.\n\nConsumers have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year. At present [[Schufa]], the main provider of credit file data, provides scores for about three-quarters of the German population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9343.html|title=Lecture: Court in the Akten &#124; Sunday &#124; Schedule 35th Chaos Communication Congress|website=fahrplan.events.ccc.de}}</ref>\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], there are four credit information companies licensed by [[Reserve Bank of India]]. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited ([[CIBIL]]) has functioned as a Credit Information Company from January 2001.<ref name=\"Reserve Bank of India\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5540&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> Subsequently, in 2010, [[Experian]],<ref name=\"Reserve Bank of India\"/> [[Equifax]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5598&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> and [[CRIF High Mark Credit Information Services|CRIF High Mark]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=6137&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> were given licenses by [[Reserve Bank of India]] to operate as Credit Information Companies in India.\n\nAlthough all the four credit information companies have developed their individual credit scores, the most popular is [[CIBIL]] credit score. The [[CIBIL]] credit score is a three  digit number that represents a summary of individuals' credit history and credit rating. This score ranges from 300 to 900, with 900 being the best score. Individuals with no credit history will have a score of -1. If the credit history is less than six months, the score will be 0. [[CIBIL]] credit score takes time to build up and usually it takes between 18 and 36 months or more of credit usage to obtain a satisfactory credit score.\n\n===Norway===\nIn [[Norway]], credit scoring services are provided by three credit scoring agencies: [[Dun & Bradstreet]], [[Experian]] and Lindorff Decision. Credit scoring is based on publicly available information such as demographic data, tax returns, taxable income and any ''Betalingsanmerkning'' (non-payment records) that might be registered on the credit-scored individual. Upon being scored, an individual will receive a notice (written or by e-mail) from the scoring agency stating who performed the credit score as well as any information provided in the score. In addition, many credit institutions use custom scorecards based on any number of parameters. Credit scores range between 300 and 999.\n\n===South Africa===\nCredit scoring is used throughout the credit industry in [[South Africa]], with the likes of banks, micro-lenders, clothing retailers, furniture retailers, specialized lenders and insurers all using credit scores.  Currently all four retail [[credit bureau]] offer credit bureau scores.  The data stored by the credit bureaus include both positive and negative data, increasing the predictive power of the individual scores.  [[TransUnion]] (formerly ITC) offer the Empirica Score which is, as of mid-2010, in its 4th generation.  The Empirica score is segmented into two suites: the account origination (AO) and account management (AM).  [[Experian]] South Africa likewise has a Delphi credit score with their fourth generation about to be released (late 2010). In 2011, [[Compuscan]] released Compuscore ABC, a scoring suite which predicts the probability of customer default throughout the credit life cycle. Six years later, Compuscan introduced Compuscore PSY, a 3-digit psychometric-based credit bureau score used by lenders to make informed lending decisions on thin files or marginal declines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.compuscan.co.za/introducing-newest-service-offering-compuscore-psy/|title=Introducing our newest service offering: Compuscore PSY|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nAccording to the provisions of Credit Information Bureau Act No 18 of 1990 (as amended by Act No 42 of 2008), [[Credit Information Bureau, Inc.|CRIB]] has been delegated with power to issue credit reports to any subject to whom that information is related to. The Bureau commenced to issue Self Inquiry Credit Reports in December 2009.<ref>[http://www.crib.lk/en/index.php/customer-help-desk/obtain-your-own-credit-report Crib.lk] (Sri Lanks)</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\nSweden has a system for credit scoring that aims to find people with a history of neglect to pay bills or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make payments after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish [[Enforcement Authority]] which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a ''Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning'' (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company.<ref>{{cite web|title=Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning|url=https://www.kronofogden.se/Betalningsanmarkning2.html|website=kronofogden.se|publisher=[[Enforcement Authority]]|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> This kind of nonpayment record will make it very difficult to get a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where you handle cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Liljemalm|first1=Anna|title=S\u00e5 minskar skulder chansen att f\u00e5 l\u00e4genhet|trans-title=Debts reduce chances to get an apartment|url=http://www.gp.se/ekonomi/1.2618214-sa-minskar-skulder-chansen-att-fa-lagenhet|website=gp.se|publisher=[[G\u00f6teborgs-Posten]]|date=3 February 2015|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIf a person gets an injunction to pay issued by the Enforcement Authority, it is possible to dispute it. Then the party requesting the payment must show its correctness in district court. Failure to dispute is seen as admitting the debt. If the debtor loses the court trial, costs for the trial are added to the debt. Taxes and authority fees must always be paid on demand unless payment has already been made.\n\nEvery person with a Swedish [[national identification number]] must register a valid address, even if living abroad, since sent letters are considered to have been delivered to that person once they reach the registered address. As an example, Swedish astronaut [[Christer Fuglesang]] got a ''Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning'' since a car he had ordered, and therefore owned, passed a toll station for the [[Stockholm congestion tax]]. At the time, he was living in the USA training for his first [[STS-116|Space Shuttle mission]] and had an old invalid address registered for the car. Letters with payment requests did not reach him on time. The case was appealed and retracted, but the non-payment record remained for three years since it could not be retracted according to the law.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Olsson|first1=Caroline|title=Fuglesang hamnar hos kronofogden|trans-title=Fuglesang at the Swedish Enforcement Administration|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article11372512.ab|website=aftonbladet.se|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Credit scorecards}}\nCredit scoring in the United Kingdom is very different to that of the United States and other nations. There is no such thing as a universal credit score or credit rating in the UK. Each lender will assess potential borrowers on their own criteria, and these algorithms are effectively trade secrets.<ref>https://www.equifax.co.uk/resources/loans_and_credit/credit-myths-the-truth-about-credit.html</ref>\n\n\"Credit scores\" which are available for individuals to see and provided from [[Credit Reference Agencies]] such as Call Credit, [[Equifax]], [[Experian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/video/heres-what-your-credit-score-is-according-to-an-experian-executive-14819049|title=Here's What Your Credit Score Is According to an Experian Executive|first=Katherine|last=Ross|date=27 December 2018|website=TheStreet}}</ref> and [[TransUnion]] are marketed to consumers and are not usually used by lenders. Most lenders instead use their own internal scoring mechanism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe most popular statistical technique used is [[logistic regression]] to predict a binary outcome: bad debt or no bad debt.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Some banks also build regression models that predict the amount of bad debt a customer may incur. Typically this is much harder to predict, and most banks focus only on the binary outcome.\n\nCredit scoring is closely regulated only by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] when used for the purposes of the Advanced approach to Capital Adequacy under [[Basel II]] regulations.\n\nCredit scoring is closely regulated in the UK, with the industry regulator being the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). Consumers can also send complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service if they experience problems with any Credit Reference Agency.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hulland|first=Louise|title=Credit Reference Agencies|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mg74/features/credit-reference-agency|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIt is very difficult for a consumer to know in advance whether they have a high enough credit score to be accepted for credit with a given lender.  This situation is due to the complexity and structure of credit scoring, which differs from one lender to another.\n\nLenders need not reveal their credit score head, nor need they reveal the minimum credit score required for the applicant to be accepted, because there may not be such a minimum score.\n\nIf the applicant is declined for credit, the lender is not obliged to reveal the exact reason why. However industry associations including the [[Finance and Leasing Association]] oblige their members to provide a satisfactory reason. Credit-bureau data sharing agreements also require that an applicant declined based on credit-bureau data is told that this is the reason and the address of the credit bureau must be provided.\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Credit score in the United States}}\nIn the United States, a credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit files, that in theory represents the [[creditworthiness]] of that person, which is the likelihood that people will pay their bills.  A credit score is primarily based on [[credit report]] information, typically from one of the three major [[credit bureau]]s: [[Experian]], [[TransUnion]], and [[Equifax]]. Income and employment history (or lack thereof) are not considered by the major credit bureaus when calculating credit scores.\n\nThere are different methods of calculating credit scores. [[FICO score]]s, the most widely used type of credit score, is a credit score developed by [[FICO]], previously known as [[Fair Isaac|Fair Isaac Corporation]].  As of 2018, there are currently 29 different versions of FICO scores in use in the United States. Some of these versions are \"industry specific\" scores, that is, scores produced for particular market segments, including automotive lending and bankcard (credit card) lending. Industry-specific FICO scores produced for automotive lending are formulated differently than FICO scores produced for bankcard lending. Nearly every consumer will have different FICO scores depending upon which type of FICO score is ordered by a lender; for example, a consumer with several paid-in-full car loans but no reported credit card payment history will generally score better on a FICO automotive-enhanced score than on a FICO bankcard-enhanced score. FICO also produces several \"general purpose\" scores which are not tailored to any particular industry. Industry-specific FICO scores range from 250 to 900, whereas general purpose scores range from 300 to 850.\n\nFICO scores are used by many mortgage lenders that use a risk-based system to determine the possibility that the borrower may default on financial obligations to the mortgage lender. For most mortgages originated in the United States, three credit scores are obtained on a consumer: a Beacon 5.0 score (Beacon is a trademark of FICO) which is calculated from the consumer's Equifax credit history, a FICO Model II score, which is calculated from the consumer's Experian credit history, and a Classic04 score, which is calculated from the consumer's Trans Union history.\n\n[[Credit bureau]]s also often re-sell FICO scores directly to consumers, often a general-purpose FICO 8 score. Previously, the credit bureaus also sold their own credit scores which they developed themselves, and which did not require payment to FICO to utilize: [[Equifax]]'s RISK score and [[Experian]]'s PLUS score. However, as of 2018, these scores are no longer sold by the credit bureaus. Trans Union offers a Vantage 3.0 score for sale to consumers, which is a version of the [[VantageScore]] credit score. In addition, many large lenders, including the major credit card issuers, have developed their own proprietary scoring models.\n\nStudies have shown scores to be predictive of risk in the underwriting of both credit and insurance.<ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/RptCongress/creditscore/creditscore.pdf Report to the Congress on credit scoring and its effects on the availability and affordability of credit]</ref><ref name=insurance>[http://www2.ftc.gov/os/2007/07/P044804FACTA_Report_Credit-Based_Insurance_Scores.pdf Credit-based insurance scores: Impacts on consumers of automobile insurance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511204147/http://ftc.gov/os/2007/07/P044804FACTA_Report_Credit-Based_Insurance_Scores.pdf |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iii.org/media/presentations/creditscoringtexas/|title=No Evidence of Disparate Impact in Texas Due to Use of Credit Information by Personal Lines Insurers - III|author=|date=|website=iii.org}}</ref>  Some studies even suggest that most consumers are the beneficiaries of lower credit costs and insurance premiums due to the use of credit scores.<ref name=insurance/><ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2003/0203lead.pdf An overview of consumer data and credit reporting]</ref>\n\nNew credit scores have been developed in the last decade by companies such as Scorelogix, [[PRBC (company)|PRBC]], L2C, [[Innovis]] etc. which do not use bureau data to predict creditworthiness. Scorelogix's JSS Credit Score uses a different set of risk factors, such as the borrower's job stability, income, income sufficiency, and impact of economy, in predicting credit risk, and the use of such alternative credit scores is on the rise. These new types of credit scores are often combined with FICO or bureau scores to improve the accuracy of predictions. Most lenders today use some combination of bureau scores and alternative credit scores to develop better understanding of a borrower's ability to pay.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIt is widely recognized that FICO is a measure of past ability to pay. New credit scores that focus more on future ability to pay are being deployed to enhance credit risk models. L2C offers an alternative credit score that uses utility payment histories to determine creditworthiness, and many lenders use this score in addition to bureau scores to make lending decisions. Many lenders use Scorelogix's JSS score in addition to bureau scores, given that the JSS score incorporates job and income stability to determine whether the borrower will have the ability to repay debt in the future. It is thought that the FICO score will remain the dominant score, but it will likely be used in conjunction with other alternative credit scores that offer other pictures of risk.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nUsage of credit histories in employment screenings has increased from 19% in 1996 to 42% in 2006.<ref name=wernau>{{cite news|last=Wernau|first=Julie|title=TransUnion battling attempts to ban employment credit checks|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-04-28/business/ct-biz-0429-credit-checks-transunion--20100428_1_credit-checks-transunion-credit-bureaus|accessdate=23 October 2011|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=28 April 2010}}</ref>{{rp|1}}  However, credit reports for employment screening purposes do not include credit scores.<ref name=wernau />{{rp|2}}\n\nAmericans are entitled to one free credit report in every 12-month period from each of the three credit bureaus, but are not entitled to receive a free credit score. The three credit bureaus run [[Annualcreditreport.com]], where users can get their free credit reports. Credit scores are available as an add-on feature of the report for a fee. If the consumer disputes an item on a credit report obtained using the free system, under the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (FCRA), the credit bureaus have 45 days to investigate, rather than 30 days for reports obtained otherwise.<ref>[http://www.equifax.com/answers/correct-credit-report-errors/en_cp Equifax Credit Report Dispute FAQs] retrieved on 18 December 2008</ref>\n\nAlternatively, consumers wishing to obtain their credit scores can in some cases purchase them separately from the credit bureaus or can purchase their FICO score directly from [[FICO]]. Credit scores (including FICO scores) are also made available free by subscription to one of the many [[credit report monitoring]] services available from the credit bureaus or other third parties, although to actually get the scores free from most such services, one must use a credit card to sign up for a free trial subscription of the service and then cancel before the first monthly charge. Websites like [[WalletHub]], [[Credit Sesame]] and [[Credit Karma]] provide free credit scores with no credit card required, using the [[TransUnion]] VantageScore 3.0 model. Credit.com uses the [[Experian]] VantageScore 3.0 model. Until March 2009, holders of credit cards issued by [[Washington Mutual]] were offered a free FICO score each month through the bank's Web site. ([[Chase (bank)|Chase]], which took over Washington Mutual in 2008, discontinued this practice in March 2009.)<ref>[http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/cc/credit-card-update.asp Chase drops WaMu secured card, FICO score] retrieved on 17 January 2009</ref> [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] resumed the practice of offering a free FICO score in March 2010 of select card members to the exclusion of the majority of former WAMU card holders.\n\nUnder the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], a consumer is entitled to a free credit report (but not a free credit score) within 60 days of any adverse action (e.g., being denied credit, or receiving substandard credit terms from a lender) taken as a result of their credit score. Under the [[Wall Street reform]] bill passed on 22 July 2010, a consumer is entitled to receive a free credit score if they are denied a loan or insurance due to their credit score.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/07/15/president-obama-final-passage-wall-street-reform-end-bailouts-a-beginning-accountabi President Obama on Final Passage of Wall Street Reform: An End to Bailouts, a Beginning for Accountability] published 15 July 2010, retrieved on 26 July 2010.</ref>\n\nThe generic or classic FICO credit score ranges between 300 and 850. The VantageScore 3.0 score ranges from 300-850. The old VantageScore was between 501 and 990.\n\nThe first step to interpreting a score is to identify the source of the credit score and its use. There are numerous scores based on various scoring models sold to lenders and other users. The most common was created by FICO and is called FICO score. [[FICO]] is a publicly traded corporation (under the ticker symbol FICO) that created the best-known and most widely used credit score model in the United States. FICO produces scoring models which are installed at and distributed by the three largest national credit repositories in the U.S (TransUnion, Equifax and Experian) and the two national credit repositories in Canada (TransUnion Canada and Equifax Canada).  FICO controls the vast majority of the credit score market in the United States and Canada although there are several other competing players that collectively share a very small percentage of the market.\n\nIn the United States, the [[median]] generic FICO score was 723 in 2006 and 711 in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fico.com/en/blogs/tag/score-distributions/|title=Score Distributions|author=|date=|website=FICO}}</ref>  The performance definition of the FICO risk score (its stated design objective) is to predict the likelihood that a consumer will go 90 days past due or worse in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated.  The higher the consumer's score, the less likely he or she will go 90 days past due in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated.  Because different lending uses (mortgage, automobile, credit card) have different parameters, FICO algorithms are adjusted according to the predictability of that use.  For this reason, a person might have a higher credit score for a revolving credit card debt when compared to a mortgage credit score taken at the same point in time.\n\nThe interpretation of a credit score will vary by lender, industry, and the economy as a whole.  While 640 has been a divider between \"prime\" and \"subprime\", all considerations about score revolve around the strength of the economy in general and investors' appetites for risk in providing the funding for borrowers in particular when the score is evaluated.  In 2010, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) tightened its guidelines regarding credit scores to a small degree, but lenders who have to service and sell the securities packaged for sale into the secondary market largely raised their minimum score to 640 in the absence of strong compensating factors in the borrower's loan profile.  In another housing example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began charging extra for loans over 75% of the value that have scores below 740. Furthermore, private mortgage insurance companies will not even provide mortgage insurance for borrowers with scores below 660. Therefore, \"prime\" is a product of the lender's appetite for the risk profile of the borrower at the time that the borrower is asking for the loan.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nSeveral factors affect individual's credit scores. One factor is the amount an individual borrowed as compared to the amount of credit available to the individual. As an individual borrows, or leverages, more money, the individual's credit score decreases.\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\nCredit Scores in UAE are issued by AECB, a Federal Government-held company. Individual Credit Scores are three-digit numbers used to predict the likelihood of an individual making their loan and credit card payments on time, based on previous credit and payment behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moneymall.ae/credit-score/|title=Credit Score in UAE|last=|first=|date=|website=moneymall.ae|publisher='MoneyMall' leading personal finance portal in UAE|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=22 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Credit Score number in UAE ranges from 300 to 900. A low score indicates a higher risk, whereas a higher score indicates a lower risk.\n\nIssuer of Credit Score is Al Etihad Credit Bureau.  its a Public Joint Stock Company wholly owned by the UAE Federal Government. As per UAE Federal Law No. (6) of 2010 concerning Credit Information, the company is mandated to regularly collect credit information from financial and non-financial institutions in the UAE.\n\nAl Etihad Credit Bureau aggregates and analyzes this data to calculate Credit Scores and produce Credit Reports that are made available to individuals and companies in the UAE.\n\nCredit Scoring is relatively new in UAE, But All major banks started using the same which shows its high importance hence\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Alternative data]]\n* [[Bank statement]]\n* [[Credit bureau]]\n* [[Credit history]]\n* [[Credit reference]]\n* [[Credit repair software]]\n* [[Credit scorecards]]\n* [[Social Credit System]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre24.shtm|title=FTC Guide to Credit Scores}}\n* {{cite web|title=Credit Scores Video - Federal Trade Commission|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iliZgmqgRRE}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.fcac.gc.ca|title=Financial Consumer Agency of Canada}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/credit-score.htm|title=How Credit Scores Work}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/economic-commentary-archives/2010-economic-commentaries/ec-201016-your-credit-score-is-a-ranking-not-a-score.aspx|title=Your Credit Score Is a Ranking, Not a Score}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Credit Score}}\n[[Category:Credit scoring| ]]\n[[Category:Personal finance]]\n", "name_user": "193.213.54.53", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score"}
