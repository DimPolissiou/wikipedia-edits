As such, its presiding officer was called a \"provost\", and reported to the main campus in Berkeley. In 1951, UCLA was formally elevated to co-equal status with UC Berkeley, and its presiding officer [[Raymond B. Allen]] was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. The appointment of [[Franklin David Murphy]] to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university and not simply a branch of the UC system. This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him:\n\n<blockquote>\nI picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, \"University of California.\" And I said, \"Is this Berkeley?\" She said, \"No.\" I said, \"Well, who have I gotten to?\" \"UCLA.\" I said, \"Why didn't you say UCLA?\" \"Oh\", she said, \"we're instructed to say University of California.\" So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, \"Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, 'UCLA.{{'\"}} And they said, \"You know they won't like it at Berkeley.\" And I said, \"Well, let's just see.

Today, the campus includes 163 buildings across 419&nbsp;acres (1.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) in the western part of [[Los Angeles]], north of the Westwood shopping district and just south of [[Sunset Boulevard]].

The campus is informally divided into North Campus and South Campus, which are both on the eastern half of the university's land. North Campus is the original campus core; its buildings are more traditional in appearance and clad in imported Italian brick. North Campus is home to the arts, humanities, social sciences, law, history, and business programs and is centered around ficus and sycamore-lined Dickson Court, also known as the \"Sunken Garden\". South Campus is home to the physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, mathematical sciences, health-related fields, and the [[UCLA Medical Center]]. The campus includes sculpture gardens, fountains, museums, and a mix of architectural styles.\n\nAckerman Union, the [[John Wooden Center]], the Arthur Ashe Health and Wellness Center, the Student Activities Center, Kerckhoff Hall, the J.D. Morgan Center, the James West Alumni Center, and [[Pauley Pavilion]] stand at the center of the campus, bordering Wilson Plaza. The campus is bisected by Bruin Walk, a heavily traveled pathway from the residential hill to the main campus. At the intersection of Bruin Walk and Westwood Plaza is Bruin Plaza, featuring an outdoor performing arts stage and a bronze statue of the Bruin bear.\n\nDuring the [[2028 Summer Olympics]], wrestling and judo will be held at Pauley Pavilion.

As such, its presiding officer was called a \"provost\", and reported to the main campus in Berkeley. In 1951, UCLA was formally elevated to co-equal status with UC Berkeley, and its presiding officer [[Raymond B. Allen]] was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. The appointment of [[Franklin David Murphy]] to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university and not simply a branch of the UC system. This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him:\n\n<blockquote>\nI picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, \"University of California.\" And I said, \"Is this Berkeley?\" She said, \"No.\" I said, \"Well, who have I gotten to?\" \"UCLA.\" I said, \"Why didn't you say UCLA?\" \"Oh\", she said, \"we're instructed to say University of California.\" So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, \"Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, 'UCLA.{{'\"}} And they said, \"You know they won't like it at Berkeley.\" And I said, \"Well, let's just see.

Today, the campus includes 163 buildings across 419&nbsp;acres (1.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) in the western part of [[Los Angeles]], north of the Westwood shopping district and just south of [[Sunset Boulevard]].

The campus is informally divided into North Campus and South Campus, which are both on the eastern half of the university's land. North Campus is the original campus core; its buildings are more traditional in appearance and clad in imported Italian brick. North Campus is home to the arts, humanities, social sciences, law, history, and business programs and is centered around ficus and sycamore-lined Dickson Court, also known as the \"Sunken Garden\". South Campus is home to the physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, mathematical sciences, health-related fields, and the [[UCLA Medical Center]]. The campus includes sculpture gardens, fountains, museums, and a mix of architectural styles.\n\nAckerman Union, the [[John Wooden Center]], the Arthur Ashe Health and Wellness Center, the Student Activities Center, Kerckhoff Hall, the J.D. Morgan Center, the James West Alumni Center, and [[Pauley Pavilion]] stand at the center of the campus, bordering Wilson Plaza. The campus is bisected by Bruin Walk, a heavily traveled pathway from the residential hill to the main campus. At the intersection of Bruin Walk and Westwood Plaza is Bruin Plaza, featuring an outdoor performing arts stage and a bronze statue of the Bruin bear.\n\nDuring the [[2028 Summer Olympics]], wrestling and judo will be held at Pauley Pavilion.
