However, this hypothesis does not explain the mystery of why two very different scripts, Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b and Brahmi, developed from the same Aramaic. A possible explanation might be that Ashoka created an imperial script for his edicts, but there is no evidence to support this conjecture.{{Sfn|Salomon|1998|p=28}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====B\u00fchler's theory====\nAccording to the Semitic hypothesis as laid out by B\u00fchler in 1898, the oldest Brahmi inscriptions were derived from a Phoenician prototype.{{sfn|B\u00fchler|1898|p=59,68,71,75}}{{refn|group=note|Aramaic is written from right to left, as are several early examples of Brahmi.{{sfn|Salomon|1996}}{{page needed|date=March 2017}} For example, Brahmi and Aramaic ''g'' ([[Image:Brahmi_g.svg|15px|ga]] and [[Image:Gimel.svg|15px|gimel]]) and Brahmi and Aramaic ''t'' ([[Image:Brahmi_t.svg|15px|ta]] and [[Image:taw.svg|15px|taw]]) are nearly identical, as are several other pairs. B\u00fchler also perceived a pattern of derivation in which certain characters were turned upside down, as with ''pe'' [[File:Phoenician pe.svg|15px|Pe]] and [[File:Brahmi p.svg|15px]] ''pa'', which he attributed to a stylistic preference against top-heavy characters.}} Salomon states B\u00fchler's arguments are \"weak historical, geographical, and chronological justifications for a Phoenician prototype\". Discoveries made since B\u00fchler's proposal, such as of six Mauryan inscriptions in Aramaic, suggest B\u00fchler's proposal about Phoenician as weak. It is more likely that Aramaic, which was virtually certain the prototype for Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b, also may have been the basis for Brahmi. However, it is unclear why the ancient Indians would have developed two very different scripts.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=28}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;\"\n |+ Comparison of North Semitic and Brahmi scripts{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=25}}{{refn|group=note|B\u00fchler notes that other authors derive [[File:Brahmi ch.svg|15px]] (cha) from qoph. \"M.L.\" indicates that the letter was used as a ''[[mater lectionis]]'' in some phase of Phoenician or Aramaic.

For example, Aramaic lacks the [[retroflex consonant|phonetic retroflex feature]] that appears among Prakrit [[Dental consonant|dental]] stops, such as {{IAST|\u1e0d}}, and in Brahmi the symbols of the retroflex and non-retroflex consonants are graphically very similar, as if both had been derived from a single prototype. (See [[Tibetan alphabet#Consonants|Tibetan alphabet]] for a similar later development.) Aramaic did not have Brahmi's [[aspirated consonant]]s ({{IAST|kh}}, {{IAST|th}}, ''etc.''), whereas Brahmi did not have Aramaic's [[emphatic consonant]]s (''{{transl|sem|q, \u1e6d, \u1e63}}''), and it appears that these unneeded emphatic letters filled in for some of Brahmi's aspirates: Aramaic ''q'' for Brahmi ''kh,'' Aramaic ''\u1e6d'' (\u0398) for Brahmi ''th'' ({{IPA|\u0298}}), ''etc.'' And just where Aramaic did not have a corresponding emphatic stop, ''p'', Brahmi seems to have doubled up for the corresponding aspirate: Brahmi ''p'' and ''ph'' are graphically very similar, as if taken from the same source in Aramaic ''p''. B\u00fchler saw a systematic derivational principle for the other aspirates ''ch'', ''jh'', ''ph'', ''bh'', and ''dh'', which involved adding a curve or upward hook to the right side of the character (which has been speculated to derive from ''h'', [[File:Brahmi h.svg|15px]]), while ''d'' and ''\u1e6d'' (not to be confused with the Semitic emphatic {{transl|sem|\u1e6d}}) were derived by back formation from ''dh'' and ''\u1e6dh''.{{sfn|B\u00fchler|1898|p=76-77}}\n\nThe attached table lists the correspondences between Brahmi and North Semitic scripts.{{sfn|B\u00fchler|1898|p=82-83}}{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=25}}\n\nB\u00fchler states that both Phoenician and Brahmi had three voiceless [[sibilant]]s, but because the alphabetical ordering was lost, the correspondences among them are not clear. B\u00fchler was able to suggest Brahmi derivatives corresponding to all of the 22 North Semitic characters, though clearly, as B\u00fchler himself recognized, some are more confident than others. He tended to place much weight on phonetic congruence as a guideline, for example connecting ''c'' [[File:Brahmi c.svg|15px]] to [[tsade]] [[Image:Phoenician sade.svg|15px]] rather than [[kaph]] [[File:Phoenician kaph.svg|15px]], as preferred by many of his predecessors.\n\nOne of the key problems with a Phoenician derivation is the lack of evidence for historical contact with Phoenicians in the relevant period.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=28}} B\u00fchler explained this by proposing that the initial borrowing of Brahmi characters dates back considerably earlier than the earliest known evidence, as far back as 800&nbsp;BCE, contemporary with the Phoenician glyph forms that he mainly compared. B\u00fchler cited a near-modern practice of writing Brahmic scripts informally without vowel diacritics as a possible continuation of this earlier abjad-like stage in development.{{sfn|B\u00fchler|1898|p=84\u201391}}\n\nThe weakest forms of the Semitic hypothesis are similar to Gnanadesikan's [[trans-cultural diffusion]] view of the development of Brahmi and Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b, in which the idea of alphabetic sound representation was learned from the Aramaic-speaking Persians, but much of the writing system was a novel development tailored to the phonology of Prakrit.<ref>{{Citation|first=Amalia E.|last=Gnanadesikan|title=The Writing Revolution: Cuneiform to the Internet|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd.|year=2009|pages=173\u2013174}}</ref>\n\nAnother evidence cited in favor of Persian influence has been the Hultzsch proposal in 1925 that the Prakrit/Sanskrit word for writing itself, ''lipi'' is similar to the Old Persian word ''dipi'', suggesting a probable borrowing.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hultzsch|first1=E.|title=Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum v. 1: Inscriptions of Asoka|date=1925|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford |page=xlii|url= https://archive.org/stream/InscriptionsOfAsoka.NewEditionByE.Hultzsch/HultzschCorpusAsokaSearchable#page/n44/mode/1up|access-date=8 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Scharfe 2002\" /> A few of the Ashoka edicts from the region nearest the Persian empire use ''dipi'' as the Prakrit word for writing, which appears as ''lipi'' elsewhere, and this geographic distribution has long been taken, at least back to B\u00fchler's time, as an indication that the standard ''lipi'' form is a later alteration that appeared as it diffused away from the Persian sphere of influence.

Falk also puts forth his own ideas. As have a number of other authors, Falk sees the basic [[writing]] [[system]] of Brahmi as being derived from the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b script, itself a derivative of Aramaic. At the time of his writing, the Ashoka edicts were the oldest confidently dateable examples of Brahmi, and he perceives in them \"a clear development in language from a faulty linguistic style to a well honed one\"{{Sfn|Annette Wilke| Oliver Moebus| 2011|p=194, footnote 421}} over time, which he takes to indicate that the script had been recently developed.{{sfn|Falk|1993|pp=109\u2013167}}<ref name=salomon1995rev/> Falk deviates from the mainstream of opinion in seeing Greek as also being a significant source for Brahmi. On this point particularly, Salomon disagrees with Falk, and after presenting evidence of very different methodology between Greek and Brahmi notation of vowel quantity, he states \"it is doubtful whether Brahmi derived even the basic concept from a Greek prototype\".{{Sfn|Salomon|1998|p=22}} Further, adds Salomon, in a \"limited sense Brahmi can be said to be derived from Kharosthi, but in terms of the actual forms of the characters, the differences between the two Indian scripts are much greater than the similarities\".{{Sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=23}}\n\nFalk also dated the origin of Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b to no earlier than 325&nbsp;BCE, based on a proposed connection to the Greek conquest.{{sfn|Falk|1993|pp=104}} Salomon questions Falk's arguments as to the date of Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b and writes that it is \"speculative at best and hardly constitutes firm grounds for a late date for Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b. The stronger argument for this position is that we have no specimen of the script before the time of Ashoka, nor any direct evidence of intermediate stages in its development; but of course this does not mean that such earlier forms did not exist, only that, if they did exist, they have not survived, presumably because they were not employed for monumental purposes before Ashoka\".<ref name=salomon1995rev>{{cite journal | last=Salomon | first=Richard | title=Review: On the Origin of the Early Indian Scripts | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume=115 | issue=2 | year=1995 | pages=271\u2013278 | doi=10.2307/604670 | jstor=604670 }}</ref>\n\nUnlike B\u00fchler, Falk does not provide details of which and how the presumptive prototypes may have been mapped to the individual characters of Brahmi. Further, states Salomon, Falk accepts there are anomalies in phonetic value and diacritics in Brahmi script that are not found in the presumed Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b script source.

The [[Bhattiprolu alphabet]], with earliest inscriptions dating from a few decades of Ashoka's reign, is believed to have evolved from a southern variant of the Brahmi alphabet. The language used in these inscriptions, nearly all of which have been found upon Buddhist relics, is exclusively Prakrit, though [[Kannada script|Kannada]]  and Telugu proper names have been identified in some inscriptions. Twenty-three letters have been identified. The letters ''ga'' and ''sa'' are similar to Mauryan Brahmi, while ''bha'' and ''da'' resemble those of modern [[Kannada script|Kannada]] and [[Telugu script]].\n\n[[Tamil-Brahmi]] is a variant of the Brahmi alphabet that was in use in South India by about 3rd century BCE, particularly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Inscriptions attest their use in parts of Sri Lanka in the same period. The language used in around 70 Southern Brahmi inscriptions discovered in the 20th century have been identified as a Prakrit language.<ref name=mahadevan/><ref name=spuler1975/>\n\nIn English, the most widely available set of reproductions of Brahmi texts found in Sri Lanka is ''Epigraphia Zeylanica''; in volume&nbsp;1 (1976), many of the inscriptions are dated from the 3rd to 2nd century BCE.<ref>Epigraphia Zeylanica: 1904\u20131912, Volume&nbsp;1.

When no vowel is written, the vowel {{IPA|/a/}} is understood. This \"default short a\" is a characteristic shared with Kharosth\u012b, though the treatment of vowels differs in other respects. \n[[File:Brahmi consonants.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4|Brahmi consonants.]]\n\n===Conjunct consonants===\n{{see also|Conjunct consonant}}\n[[File:\u092c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093f \u091c\u094b\u0921\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u0947.jpg|thumb|Some major conjunct consonants in the Brahmi script.]]\nSpecial [[conjunct consonant]]s are used to write [[consonant cluster]]s such as {{IPA|/pr/}} or {{IPA|/rv/}}.

There are three \"primary\" vowels in Ashokan Brahmi, which each occur in length-contrasted forms: /a/, /i/, /u/; [[vowel length|long vowels]] are derived from the letters for short vowels. There are also four \"secondary\" vowels that do not have the long-short contrast, /e/, /ai/, /o/, /au/.{{sfn|Salomon|1996|pp=373\u20134}} Note though that the grapheme for /ai/ is derivative from /e/ in a way which parallels the short-long contrast of the primary vowels. However, there are only nine distinct vowel diacritics, as short {{IPA|/a/}} is understood if no vowel is written. The initial vowel symbol for /au/ is also apparently lacking in the earliest attested phases, even though it has a diacritic. Ancient sources suggest that there were either 11 or 12 vowels enumerated at the beginning of the character list around the Ashokan era, probably adding either ''a\u1e43'' or ''a\u1e25''.{{sfn|B\u00fchler|1898|p=32}} Later versions of Brahmi add vowels for four syllabic liquids, short and long /\u1e5b/ and /\u1e37/. Chinese sources indicate that these were later inventions by either [[Nagarjuna]] or \u015aarvavarman, a minister of King [[H\u0101la]].{{sfn|B\u00fchler|1898|p=33}}\n\nIt has been noted that the basic system of vowel marking common to Brahmi and Kharosth\u012b, in which every consonant is understood to be followed by a vowel, was well suited to Prakrit,<ref name=\"Daniels 2008\">{{citation|chapter=Writing systems of major and minor languages|title=Language in South Asia|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last=Daniels|first=Peter T.|page=287}}</ref> but as Brahmi was adapted to other languages, a special notation called the ''[[vir\u0101ma]]'' was introduced to indicate the omission of the final vowel. Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b also differs in that the initial vowel representation has a single generic vowel symbol that is differentiated by diacritics, and long vowels are not distinguished.\n\nThe [[collation]] order of Brahmi is believed to have been the same as most of its descendant scripts, one based on [[Shiksha]], the traditional Vedic theory of Sanskrit phonology. This begins the list of characters with the initial vowels (starting with ''a''), then lists a subset of the consonants in 5 phonetically-related groups of 5 called ''vargas'', and ends with 4 liquids, 3 sibilants, and a spirant. [[Thomas Trautmann]] attributes much of the popularity of the Brahmic script family to this \"splendidly reasoned\" system of arrangement.{{sfn|Trautmann|2006|p=62\u201364}}\n\n{{Brahmi vowel compounds}}\n\n===Punctuation===\n[[File:Vidisha ivory carvers inscription in Sanchi.jpg|thumb|upright=2|A 1st century BCE/CE inscription from [[Sanchi]]: ''\"Vedisakehi da\u1e43tak\u0101rehi rupaka\u1e43ma\u1e43 kata\u1e43\"'' ({{Script|Brah|\ud804\udc2f\ud804\udc42\ud804\udc24\ud804\udc3a\ud804\udc32\ud804\udc13\ud804\udc42\ud804\udc28\ud804\udc3a \ud804\udc24\ud804\udc01\ud804\udc22\ud804\udc13\ud804\udc38\ud804\udc2d\ud804\udc42\ud804\udc28\ud804\udc3a \ud804\udc2d\ud804\udc3c\ud804\udc27\ud804\udc13\ud804\udc01\ud804\udc2b\ud804\udc01 \ud804\udc13\ud804\udc22\ud804\udc01}}, \"Ivory workers from [[Vidisha]] have done the carving\").<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chakrabarti |first1=Manika |title=M\u0101lwa in Post-Maurya Period: A Critical Study with Special Emphasis on Numismatic Evidences |date=1981 |publisher=Punthi Pustak |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jba1AAAAIAAJ |language=en}}</ref>]] Punctuation<ref>Ram Sharma, ''Br\u0101hm\u012b Script: Development in North-Western India and Central Asia'', 2002</ref> can be perceived as more of an exception than as a general rule in Asokan Brahmi. For instance, distinct spaces in between the words appear frequently in the pillar edicts but not so much in others. (\"Pillar edicts\" refers to the texts that are inscribed on the stone pillars oftentimes with the intention of making them public.)  The idea of writing each word separately was not consistently used.\n\nIn the early Brahmi period, the existence of punctuation marks is not very well shown. Each letter has been written independently with some occasional space between words and longer sections.\n\nIn the middle period, the system seems to be developing. The use of a dash and a curved horizontal line is found. A lotus (flower) mark seems to mark the end, and a circular mark appears to indicate the full stop. There seem to be varieties of full stop.\n\nIn the late period, the system of interpunctuation marks gets more complicated. For instance, there are four different forms of vertically slanted double dashes that resemble \"//\" to mark the completion of the composition. Despite all the decorative signs that were available during the late period, the signs remained fairly simple in the inscriptions. One of the possible reasons may be that engraving is restricted while writing is not.\n\nBaums identifies seven different punctuation marks needed for computer representation of Brahmi:<ref>{{cite book|author1=Stefan Baums|chapter=Towards a computer encoding for Brahmi|editor1-last=Gail|editor1-first=A.J.|editor2-last=Mevissen|editor2-first=G.J.R.|editor3-last=Saloman|editor3-first=R.|title=Script and Image: Papers on Art and Epigraphy|date=2006|publisher=Shri Jainendra Press|location=New Delhi|pages=111\u2013143}}</ref>\n* single and double vertical bar ([[danda]]) \u2013 delimiting clauses and verses\n* dot, double dot, and horizontal line \u2013 delimiting shorter textual units\n* crescent and lotus \u2013 delimiting larger textual units\n\n==Evolution of the Brahmi script==\nBrahmi is generally classified in three main types, which represent three main historical stages of its evolution over nearly a millennium:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Upinder |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century |date=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=9788131711200 |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&pg=PA43 |language=en}}</ref>\n* Early Brahmi or \"Ashokan Brahmi\" (3rd-1st century BCE)\n* Middle Brahmi or \"[[Kushana]] Brahmi\" (1st-3rd centuries CE)\n* Late Brahmi or \"[[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] Brahmi\", also called [[Gupta script]] (4th-6th centuries CE)\n{{Brahmi evolution}}\n\n==Early Brahmi or \"Ashokan Brahmi\" (3rd-1st century BCE)==\nEarly \"Ashokan\" Brahmi (3rd-1st century BCE) is regular and geometric, and organized in a very rational fashion<!-- this is an opinion -->:\n\n===Independent vowels===\n[[File:Brahmi diacritic vowels.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Early Brahmi vowel diacritics.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Letter\n!IAST and<br />Sanskrit IPA\n!''M\u0101tr\u0101''\n!IAST and<br />Sanskrit IPA\n!Letter\n!IAST and<br />Sanskrit IPA\n!''M\u0101tr\u0101''\n!IAST and<br />Sanskrit IPA\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ccc;

Over time, these regional scripts became associated with the local languages. A Northern Brahmi gave rise to the [[Gupta script]] during the [[Gupta Empire]], sometimes also called \"Late Brahmi\" (used during the 5th century), which in turn diversified into a number of cursives during the Middle Ages, including the [[Siddha\u1e43 script]] (6th century), [[\u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script]] (9th century) and [[Devanagari]] (10th century).\n\nSouthern Brahmi gave rise to the [[Grantha alphabet]] (6th century), the [[Vatteluttu alphabet]] (8th century), and due to the [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|contact of Hinduism with Southeast Asia]] during the early centuries CE, also gave rise to the [[Baybayin]] in the [[Philippines]], the [[Javanese script]] in [[Indonesia]], the [[Khmer alphabet]] in [[Cambodia]], and the [[Old Mon script]] in [[Burma]].\n\nAlso in the Brahmic family of scripts are several [[Central Asia]]n scripts such as [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]], [[Tocharian alphabet|Tocharian]] (also called slanting Brahmi), and the one used to write the [[Saka language]].\n\nSeveral authors have suggested that the basic letters of [[hangul]] were modeled on the [['Phags-pa script]] of the [[Mongol Empire]], itself a derivative of the [[Tibetan alphabet]], a Brahmi script (see [[origin of Hangul]]).{{sfn|Ledyard|1994|p=336\u2013349}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Daniels|first1=Peter T.|title=On Writing Syllables: Three Episodes of Script Transfer|journal=Studies in the Linguistic Sciences|date=Spring 2000|volume=30|issue=1|pages=73\u201386|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/9639/SLS2000v30.1-09Daniels.pdf?sequence=2}}</ref>\n\nThe arrangement of Brahmi was adopted as the modern order of Japanese [[kana]], though the letters themselves are unrelated.<ref>{{cite book|first=Janet S.

B\u00fchler followed Max Weber in connecting it particularly to Phoenician and proposed an early 8th century BCE date{{sfn|B\u00fchler|1898|p=84\u201391}} for the borrowing. A link to [[Ancient South Arabian script|the South Semitic script]], a less prominent branch of the Semitic script family, has occasionally been proposed but has not gained much acceptance.{{Sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=23\u201324}} Finally, the Aramaic script being the prototype for Brahmi has been the more preferred hypothesis because of its geographic proximity to the Indian subcontinent, and its influence likely arising because Aramaic was the bureaucratic language of the Achaemenid empire. However, this hypothesis does not explain the mystery of why two very different scripts, Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b and Brahmi, developed from the same Aramaic. A possible explanation might be that Ashoka created an imperial script for his edicts, but there is no evidence to support this conjecture.{{Sfn|Salomon|1998|p=28}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====B\u00fchler's theory====\nAccording to the Semitic hypothesis as laid out by B\u00fchler in 1898, the oldest Brahmi inscriptions were derived from a Phoenician prototype.{{sfn|B\u00fchler|1898|p=59,68,71,75}}{{refn|group=note|Aramaic is written from right to left, as are several early examples of Brahmi.{{sfn|Salomon|1996}}{{page needed|date=March 2017}} For example, Brahmi and Aramaic ''g'' ([[Image:Brahmi_g.svg|15px|ga]] and [[Image:Gimel.svg|15px|gimel]]) and Brahmi and Aramaic ''t'' ([[Image:Brahmi_t.svg|15px|ta]] and [[Image:taw.svg|15px|taw]]) are nearly identical, as are several other pairs. B\u00fchler also perceived a pattern of derivation in which certain characters were turned upside down, as with ''pe'' [[File:Phoenician pe.svg|15px|Pe]] and [[File:Brahmi p.svg|15px]] ''pa'', which he attributed to a stylistic preference against top-heavy characters.}} Salomon states B\u00fchler's arguments are \"weak historical, geographical, and chronological justifications for a Phoenician prototype\". Discoveries made since B\u00fchler's proposal, such as of six Mauryan inscriptions in Aramaic, suggest B\u00fchler's proposal about Phoenician as weak. It is more likely that Aramaic, which was virtually certain the prototype for Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b, also may have been the basis for Brahmi.

For example, Aramaic lacks the [[retroflex consonant|phonetic retroflex feature]] that appears among Prakrit [[Dental consonant|dental]] stops, such as {{IAST|\u1e0d}}, and in Brahmi the symbols of the retroflex and non-retroflex consonants are graphically very similar, as if both had been derived from a single prototype. (See [[Tibetan alphabet#Consonants|Tibetan alphabet]] for a similar later development.) Aramaic did not have Brahmi's [[aspirated consonant]]s ({{IAST|kh}}, {{IAST|th}}, ''etc.''), whereas Brahmi did not have Aramaic's [[emphatic consonant]]s (''{{transl|sem|q, \u1e6d, \u1e63}}''), and it appears that these unneeded emphatic letters filled in for some of Brahmi's aspirates: Aramaic ''q'' for Brahmi ''kh,'' Aramaic ''\u1e6d'' (\u0398) for Brahmi ''th'' ({{IPA|\u0298}}), ''etc.'' And just where Aramaic did not have a corresponding emphatic stop, ''p'', Brahmi seems to have doubled up for the corresponding aspirate: Brahmi ''p'' and ''ph'' are graphically very similar, as if taken from the same source in Aramaic ''p''. B\u00fchler saw a systematic derivational principle for the other aspirates ''ch'', ''jh'', ''ph'', ''bh'', and ''dh'', which involved adding a curve or upward hook to the right side of the character (which has been speculated to derive from ''h'', [[File:Brahmi h.svg|15px]]), while ''d'' and ''\u1e6d'' (not to be confused with the Semitic emphatic {{transl|sem|\u1e6d}}) were derived by back formation from ''dh'' and ''\u1e6dh''.{{sfn|B\u00fchler|1898|p=76-77}}\n\nThe attached table lists the correspondences between Brahmi and North Semitic scripts.{{sfn|B\u00fchler|1898|p=82-83}}{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=25}}\n\nB\u00fchler states that both Phoenician and Brahmi had three voiceless [[sibilant]]s, but because the alphabetical ordering was lost, the correspondences among them are not clear. B\u00fchler was able to suggest Brahmi derivatives corresponding to all of the 22 North Semitic characters, though clearly, as B\u00fchler himself recognized, some are more confident than others. He tended to place much weight on phonetic congruence as a guideline, for example connecting ''c'' [[File:Brahmi c.svg|15px]] to [[tsade]] [[Image:Phoenician sade.svg|15px]] rather than [[kaph]] [[File:Phoenician kaph.svg|15px]], as preferred by many of his predecessors.\n\nOne of the key problems with a Phoenician derivation is the lack of evidence for historical contact with Phoenicians in the relevant period.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=28}} B\u00fchler explained this by proposing that the initial borrowing of Brahmi characters dates back considerably earlier than the earliest known evidence, as far back as 800&nbsp;BCE, contemporary with the Phoenician glyph forms that he mainly compared. B\u00fchler cited a near-modern practice of writing Brahmic scripts informally without vowel diacritics as a possible continuation of this earlier abjad-like stage in development.{{sfn|B\u00fchler|1898|p=84\u201391}}\n\nThe weakest forms of the Semitic hypothesis are similar to Gnanadesikan's [[trans-cultural diffusion]] view of the development of Brahmi and Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b, in which the idea of alphabetic sound representation was learned from the Aramaic-speaking Persians, but much of the writing system was a novel development tailored to the phonology of Prakrit.<ref>{{Citation|first=Amalia E.|last=Gnanadesikan|title=The Writing Revolution: Cuneiform to the Internet|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd.|year=2009|pages=173\u2013174}}</ref>\n\nAnother evidence cited in favor of Persian influence has been the Hultzsch proposal in 1925 that the Prakrit/Sanskrit word for writing itself, ''lipi'' is similar to the Old Persian word ''dipi'', suggesting a probable borrowing.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hultzsch|first1=E.|title=Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum v. 1: Inscriptions of Asoka|date=1925|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford |page=xlii|url= https://archive.org/stream/InscriptionsOfAsoka.NewEditionByE.Hultzsch/HultzschCorpusAsokaSearchable#page/n44/mode/1up|access-date=8 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Scharfe 2002\" /> A few of the Ashoka edicts from the region nearest the Persian empire use ''dipi'' as the Prakrit word for writing, which appears as ''lipi'' elsewhere, and this geographic distribution has long been taken, at least back to B\u00fchler's time, as an indication that the standard ''lipi'' form is a later alteration that appeared as it diffused away from the Persian sphere of influence.

Falk also puts forth his own ideas. As have a number of other authors, Falk sees the basic [[writing]] [[system]] of Brahmi as being derived from the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b script, itself a derivative of Aramaic. At the time of his writing, the Ashoka edicts were the oldest confidently dateable examples of Brahmi, and he perceives in them \"a clear development in language from a faulty linguistic style to a well honed one\"{{Sfn|Annette Wilke| Oliver Moebus| 2011|p=194, footnote 421}} over time, which he takes to indicate that the script had been recently developed.{{sfn|Falk|1993|pp=109\u2013167}}<ref name=salomon1995rev/> Falk deviates from the mainstream of opinion in seeing Greek as also being a significant source for Brahmi. On this point particularly, Salomon disagrees with Falk, and after presenting evidence of very different methodology between Greek and Brahmi notation of vowel quantity, he states \"it is doubtful whether Brahmi derived even the basic concept from a Greek prototype\".{{Sfn|Salomon|1998|p=22}} Further, adds Salomon, in a \"limited sense Brahmi can be said to be derived from Kharosthi, but in terms of the actual forms of the characters, the differences between the two Indian scripts are much greater than the similarities\".{{Sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=23}}\n\nFalk also dated the origin of Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b to no earlier than 325&nbsp;BCE, based on a proposed connection to the Greek conquest.{{sfn|Falk|1993|pp=104}} Salomon questions Falk's arguments as to the date of Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b and writes that it is \"speculative at best and hardly constitutes firm grounds for a late date for Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b. The stronger argument for this position is that we have no specimen of the script before the time of Ashoka, nor any direct evidence of intermediate stages in its development; but of course this does not mean that such earlier forms did not exist, only that, if they did exist, they have not survived, presumably because they were not employed for monumental purposes before Ashoka\".<ref name=salomon1995rev>{{cite journal | last=Salomon | first=Richard | title=Review: On the Origin of the Early Indian Scripts | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume=115 | issue=2 | year=1995 | pages=271\u2013278 | doi=10.2307/604670 | jstor=604670 }}</ref>\n\nUnlike B\u00fchler, Falk does not provide details of which and how the presumptive prototypes may have been mapped to the individual characters of Brahmi. Further, states Salomon, Falk accepts there are anomalies in phonetic value and diacritics in Brahmi script that are not found in the presumed Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b script source.

There are three \"primary\" vowels in Ashokan Brahmi, which each occur in length-contrasted forms: /a/, /i/, /u/; [[vowel length|long vowels]] are derived from the letters for short vowels. There are also four \"secondary\" vowels that do not have the long-short contrast, /e/, /ai/, /o/, /au/.{{sfn|Salomon|1996|pp=373\u20134}} Note though that the grapheme for /ai/ is derivative from /e/ in a way which parallels the short-long contrast of the primary vowels. However, there are only nine distinct vowel diacritics, as short {{IPA|/a/}} is understood if no vowel is written. The initial vowel symbol for /au/ is also apparently lacking in the earliest attested phases, even though it has a diacritic. Ancient sources suggest that there were either 11 or 12 vowels enumerated at the beginning of the character list around the Ashokan era, probably adding either ''a\u1e43'' or ''a\u1e25''.{{sfn|B\u00fchler|1898|p=32}} Later versions of Brahmi add vowels for four syllabic liquids, short and long /\u1e5b/ and /\u1e37/.

Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b also differs in that the initial vowel representation has a single generic vowel symbol that is differentiated by diacritics, and long vowels are not distinguished.\n\nThe [[collation]] order of Brahmi is believed to have been the same as most of its descendant scripts, one based on [[Shiksha]], the traditional Vedic theory of Sanskrit phonology. This begins the list of characters with the initial vowels (starting with ''a''), then lists a subset of the consonants in 5 phonetically-related groups of 5 called ''vargas'', and ends with 4 liquids, 3 sibilants, and a spirant. [[Thomas Trautmann]] attributes much of the popularity of the Brahmic script family to this \"splendidly reasoned\" system of arrangement.{{sfn|Trautmann|2006|p=62\u201364}}\n\n{{Brahmi vowel compounds}}\n\n===Punctuation===\n[[File:Vidisha ivory carvers inscription in Sanchi.jpg|thumb|upright=2|A 1st century BCE/CE inscription from [[Sanchi]]: ''\"Vedisakehi da\u1e43tak\u0101rehi rupaka\u1e43ma\u1e43 kata\u1e43\"'' ({{Script|Brah|\ud804\udc2f\ud804\udc42\ud804\udc24\ud804\udc3a\ud804\udc32\ud804\udc13\ud804\udc42\ud804\udc28\ud804\udc3a \ud804\udc24\ud804\udc01\ud804\udc22\ud804\udc13\ud804\udc38\ud804\udc2d\ud804\udc42\ud804\udc28\ud804\udc3a \ud804\udc2d\ud804\udc3c\ud804\udc27\ud804\udc13\ud804\udc01\ud804\udc2b\ud804\udc01 \ud804\udc13\ud804\udc22\ud804\udc01}}, \"Ivory workers from [[Vidisha]] have done the carving\").<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chakrabarti |first1=Manika |title=M\u0101lwa in Post-Maurya Period: A Critical Study with Special Emphasis on Numismatic Evidences |date=1981 |publisher=Punthi Pustak |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jba1AAAAIAAJ |language=en}}</ref>]] Punctuation<ref>Ram Sharma, ''Br\u0101hm\u012b Script: Development in North-Western India and Central Asia'', 2002</ref> can be perceived as more of an exception than as a general rule in Asokan Brahmi. For instance, distinct spaces in between the words appear frequently in the pillar edicts but not so much in others. (\"Pillar edicts\" refers to the texts that are inscribed on the stone pillars oftentimes with the intention of making them public.)  The idea of writing each word separately was not consistently used.\n\nIn the early Brahmi period, the existence of punctuation marks is not very well shown. Each letter has been written independently with some occasional space between words and longer sections.\n\nIn the middle period, the system seems to be developing. The use of a dash and a curved horizontal line is found. A lotus (flower) mark seems to mark the end, and a circular mark appears to indicate the full stop. There seem to be varieties of full stop.\n\nIn the late period, the system of interpunctuation marks gets more complicated. For instance, there are four different forms of vertically slanted double dashes that resemble \"//\" to mark the completion of the composition. Despite all the decorative signs that were available during the late period, the signs remained fairly simple in the inscriptions. One of the possible reasons may be that engraving is restricted while writing is not.\n\nBaums identifies seven different punctuation marks needed for computer representation of Brahmi:<ref>{{cite book|author1=Stefan Baums|chapter=Towards a computer encoding for Brahmi|editor1-last=Gail|editor1-first=A.J.|editor2-last=Mevissen|editor2-first=G.J.R.|editor3-last=Saloman|editor3-first=R.|title=Script and Image: Papers on Art and Epigraphy|date=2006|publisher=Shri Jainendra Press|location=New Delhi|pages=111\u2013143}}</ref>\n* single and double vertical bar ([[danda]]) \u2013 delimiting clauses and verses\n* dot, double dot, and horizontal line \u2013 delimiting shorter textual units\n* crescent and lotus \u2013 delimiting larger textual units\n\n==Evolution of the Brahmi script==\nBrahmi is generally classified in three main types, which represent three main historical stages of its evolution over nearly a millennium:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Upinder |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century |date=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=9788131711200 |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&pg=PA43 |language=en}}</ref>\n* Early Brahmi or \"Ashokan Brahmi\" (3rd-1st century BCE)\n* Middle Brahmi or \"[[Kushana]] Brahmi\" (1st-3rd centuries CE)\n* Late Brahmi or \"[[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] Brahmi\", also called [[Gupta script]] (4th-6th centuries CE)\n{{Brahmi evolution}}\n\n==Early Brahmi or \"Ashokan Brahmi\" (3rd-1st century BCE)==\nEarly \"Ashokan\" Brahmi (3rd-1st century BCE) is regular and geometric, and organized in a very rational fashion<!-- this is an opinion -->:\n\n===Independent vowels===\n[[File:Brahmi diacritic vowels.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Early Brahmi vowel diacritics.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Letter\n!IAST and<br />Sanskrit IPA\n!''M\u0101tr\u0101''\n!IAST and<br />Sanskrit IPA\n!Letter\n!IAST and<br />Sanskrit IPA\n!''M\u0101tr\u0101''\n!IAST and<br />Sanskrit IPA\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ccc;

Over time, these regional scripts became associated with the local languages. A Northern Brahmi gave rise to the [[Gupta script]] during the [[Gupta Empire]], sometimes also called \"Late Brahmi\" (used during the 5th century), which in turn diversified into a number of cursives during the Middle Ages, including the [[Siddha\u1e43 script]] (6th century), [[\u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script]] (9th century) and [[Devanagari]] (10th century).\n\nSouthern Brahmi gave rise to the [[Grantha alphabet]] (6th century), the [[Vatteluttu alphabet]] (8th century), and due to the [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|contact of Hinduism with Southeast Asia]] during the early centuries CE, also gave rise to the [[Baybayin]] in the [[Philippines]], the [[Javanese script]] in [[Indonesia]], the [[Khmer alphabet]] in [[Cambodia]], and the [[Old Mon script]] in [[Burma]].\n\nAlso in the Brahmic family of scripts are several [[Central Asia]]n scripts such as [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]], [[Tocharian alphabet|Tocharian]] (also called slanting Brahmi), and the one used to write the [[Saka language]].\n\nSeveral authors have suggested that the basic letters of [[hangul]] were modeled on the [['Phags-pa script]] of the [[Mongol Empire]], itself a derivative of the [[Tibetan alphabet]], a Brahmi script (see [[origin of Hangul]]).{{sfn|Ledyard|1994|p=336\u2013349}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Daniels|first1=Peter T.|title=On Writing Syllables: Three Episodes of Script Transfer|journal=Studies in the Linguistic Sciences|date=Spring 2000|volume=30|issue=1|pages=73\u201386|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/9639/SLS2000v30.1-09Daniels.pdf?sequence=2}}</ref>\n\nThe arrangement of Brahmi was adopted as the modern order of Japanese [[kana]], though the letters themselves are unrelated.<ref>{{cite book|first=Janet S.

One is that the [[Chordate]] phylum split in four before ''Metaspriggina'' lived, with ''Metaspriggina'' and the other craniates (both gnathostomatans and [[Agnatha]]) grouped with ''Branchiostoma'' and the cephalochordates, and ''Pikaia'' out on a side branch.

However, instead of being a very primitive relative, ''Pikaia'' was the ancestor of all cephalochordates, and the gill bars evolved convergently in them somewhere between ''Pikaia'' and ''Branchiostoma.''

The split between Agnatha and and other chordates must therefore have happened earlier, during Cambrium stage 1 or even Ediacaran times. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Burgess Shale species | 81}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/new-fossil-find-pinpoints-the-origin-of-jaws-in-vertebrates |title=New fossil find pinpoints the origin of jaws in vertebrates |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=June 11, 2014 |website=Research at Cambridge: News |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |location=Cambridge, England |accessdate=2014-06-13}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q140492}}\n\n[[Category:Cambrian chordates]]\n[[Category:Burgess Shale fossils]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric jawless fish genera]]\n", "text_old": "{{Taxobox\n| fossil_range = {{Fossil range|Burgess Shale}}\n| image = Metaspriggina_and_Maripolia.png\n| image_caption = An artist's concept of '''''Metaspriggina''''' based on Conway Morris, Caron.<ref name=\"ConwayMorrisCaron2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Conway Morris |first1=Simon |authorlink1=Simon Conway Morris |last2=Caron |first2=Jean-Bernard |date=June 11, 2014 |title=A primitive fish from the Cambrian of North America |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |location=London |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |doi=10.1038/nature13414 |issn=0028-0836 |volume=512 |issue=7515 |pages=419\u2013422 |pmid=24919146}}</ref>\n| regnum = [[Animal]]ia\n| phylum = [[Chordate|Chordata]]\n| familia = [[Metaspriggiidae]]\n| genus = '''''Metaspriggina'''''\n| genus_authority = Simonetta & Insom 1993\n| species = '''''M. walcotti'''''\n| binomial = ''Metaspriggina walcotti''\n| binomial_authority = Simonetta & Insom 1993<ref>{{cite book| last = Van der Laan| first = Richard| title = Family-group names of fossil fishes| year = 2016| publisher = | doi= 10.13140/RG.2.1.2130.1361| url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317888989}}</ref><ref>{{cite website | website=Collection of genus-group names in a systematic arrangement | title=Part 7- Vertebrates | url=http://mave.tweakdsl.nl/tn/genera7.html | display-authors=etal | access-date=30 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005114629/http://mave.tweakdsl.nl/tn/genera7.html | archive-date=5 October 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Metaspriggina''''' is a genus of [[chordate]] initially known from two specimens in the [[Cambrian|Middle Cambrian]] [[Burgess Shale]]<ref name=\"ConwayMorris2008\">{{cite journal |last=Conway Morris |first=Simon |date=March 2008 |title=A Redescription of a Rare Chordate, ''Metaspriggina walcotti'' Simonetta and Insom, from the Burgess Shale (Middle Cambrian), British Columbia, Canada |journal=[[Journal of Paleontology]] |location=Boulder, CO |publisher=[[Paleontological Society|The Paleontological Society]] |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=424\u2013430 |doi=10.1666/06-130.1 |issn=0022-3360 }}</ref> and 44 specimens found in 2012 at the [[Marble Canyon (Canadian Rockies)|Marble Canyon]] bed in [[Kootenay National Park]].<ref name=\"ConwayMorrisCaron2014\" />\n[[File:Metaspriggina NT small.jpg|thumb|Life reconstruction of ''Metaspriggina walcotti'']]\n\n[[File:Metaspriggina.png|thumbnail|left|Reconstruction of ''Metaspriggina'' based on the Burgess Shale specimens available then.<ref name=\"ConwayMorris2008\" /><ref name=\"royalonta\">{{Burgess Shale species | 81}}</ref>]]\n\nWhilst named after the [[Ediacara biota|Ediacaran organism]] ''[[Spriggina]]'', later work has shown the two to be unrelated.<ref name=\"ConwayMorris2008\" /> ''Metaspriggina'' is considered to represent a primitive [[chordate]], possibly transitional between [[cephalochordate]]s and the earliest [[vertebrate]]s, albeit this has been questioned because it seems to possess most of the characteristics attributed to [[craniate]]s.
