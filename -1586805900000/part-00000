Langford (Hawthorn's full back) took off his Hawthorn jumper and proudly held it above his head while leaving the field. Langford was only one of the then playing list to display his disapproval of the plan.\n\n==Statistics==\n:<ref>[https://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/S/Stephen_Silvagni.html Stephen Silvagni's player profile at AFL Tables]</ref>\n\n{{AFL player statistics legend}}\n{{AFL player statistics start with votes}}\n|-\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1983 VFL season|1983]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 28 || 11 || 3 || 9 || 105 || 66 || 171 || 39 || {{n/a}} || 0.3 || 0.8 || 9.5 || 6.0 || 15.5 || 3.5 || {{n/a}} || 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1984 VFL season|1984]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 28 || 22 || 17 || 19 || 185 || 62 || 247 || 54 || {{n/a}} || 0.8 || 0.9 || 8.4 || 2.8 || 11.2 || 2.5 || {{n/a}} || 1\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1985 VFL season|1985]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 28 || 22 || 2 || 7 || 190 || 74 || 264 || 62 || {{n/a}} || 0.1 || 0.3 || 8.6 || 3.4 || 12.0 || 2.8 || {{n/a}} || 0\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;background:#afe6ba;\"|[[1986 VFL season|1986]]\u2020\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 28 || 23 || 0 || 0 || 216 || 96 || 312 || 64 || {{n/a}} || 0.0 || 0.0 || 9.4 || 4.2 || 13.6 || 2.8 || {{n/a}} || 5\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1987 VFL season|1987]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 26 || 1 || 2 || 265 || 114 || 379 || 98 || 26 || 0.0 || 0.1 || 10.2 || 4.4 || 14.6 || 3.8 || 1.0 || 0\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;background:#afe6ba;\"|[[1988 VFL season|1988]]\u2020\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 22 || 2 || 1 || 223 || 77 || 300 || 75 || 16 || 0.1 || 0.0 || 10.1 || 3.5 || 13.6 || 3.4 || 0.7 || 5\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n|style=\"text-align:center;background:#afe6ba;\"|[[1989 VFL season|1989]]\u2020\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 23 || 0 || 1 || 216 || 96 || 312 || 82 || 19 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 9.4 || 4.2 || 13.6 || 3.6 || 0.8 || 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1990 AFL season|1990]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 20 || 2 || 0 || 164 || 68 || 232 || 62 || 13 || 0.1 || 0.0 || 8.2 || 3.4 || 11.6 || 3.1 || 0.7 || 3\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n|style=\"text-align:center;background:#afe6ba;\"|[[1991 AFL season|1991]]\u2020\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 25 || 0 || 0 || 231 || 86 || 317 || 72 || 29 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 9.2 || 3.4 || 12.7 || 2.9 || 1.2 || 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1992 AFL season|1992]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 23 || 4 || 0 || 185 || 79 || 264 || 49 || 20 || 0.2 || 0.0 || 8.0 || 3.4 || 11.5 || 2.1 || 0.9 || 0\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1993 AFL season|1993]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 21 || 0 || 0 || 192 || 85 || 277 || 50 || 38 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 9.1 || 4.0 || 13.2 || 2.4 || 1.8 || 4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1994 AFL season|1994]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 18 || 0 || 3 || 132 || 87 || 219 || 64 || 22 || 0.0 || 0.2 || 7.3 || 4.8 || 12.2 || 3.6 || 1.2 || 11\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1995 AFL season|1995]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 18 || 0 || 1 || 160 || 79 || 239 || 54 || 21 || 0.0 || 0.1 || 8.9 || 4.4 || 13.3 || 3.0 || 1.2 || 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1996 AFL season|1996]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 21 || 1 || 0 || 248 || 58 || 306 || 97 || 30 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 11.8 || 2.8 || 14.6 || 4.6 || 1.4 || 3\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1997 AFL season|1997]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 8 || 1 || 2 || 77 || 21 || 98 || 32 || 6 || 0.1 || 0.3 || 9.6 || 2.6 || 12.3 || 4.0 || 0.8 || 0\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 303\n! 33\n! 45\n! 2789\n! 1148\n! 3937\n! 954\n! 240\n! 0.1\n! 0.1\n! 9.2\n! 3.8\n! 13.0\n! 3.1\n! 1.1\n! 38\n|}\n\n==Career==\nAfter his career, he moved into game administration and was appointed to the [[AFL Commission]] in 1999.\n\n==Family==\n\nChris' son [[Will Langford|Will]] was recruited to Hawthorn in the 2011 Rookie draft, and was upgraded to the Hawthorn senior list in June 2013.

She succeeds in fighting them and saves all of China single-handedly without any help whatsoever . The Emperor of China awards her for her effort and the whole of China celebrate her return.\n\nIn [[Mulan (2020 film)|the upcoming 2020 live-action film]], Mulan's surname will be changed \"Hua (\u82b1),\" the traditional surname of Mulan, and will assume the pseudonym \"Hua Jun\" during her time in the army.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />\n\n===Li Shang===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #59E\n| name               = Captain/General Li Shang\n| image              =\n| creator            = Robert D.

His speaking voice was provided by [[B.D. Wong]] in all three titles, and his singing vocals were performed by [[Donny Osmond]] ([[Jackie Chan]] in the Cantonese version). During his appointment in the first movie, Shang is a highly capable leader with a dedication to his cause to match, albeit at times being too \"by-the-book\" and putting his duty above his feelings, in contrast to Mulan. He is exceptionally handsome due to his dashing good looks and strong physique. He is reserved and thoughtful, a more logical and calming influence to Mulan's adventurous personality.  Shortly after his initial introduction in ''Mulan'', Shang is appointed newly as an army captain by his father, who is a general. Later through the film, he becomes friends with Ping (who is Fa Mulan disguised as a man), after his life is saved. Shortly after, however, he finds out she is actually a woman, which is forbidden by the empire's law, punishable by death. Shang spares her life, and after helping her save the empire, he falls in love with her and joins her family for dinner. \n\nIn ''[[Mulan II]]'', the film begins with Shang proposing marriage to Mulan, to which she gladly agrees. He is promoted from captain to general by the emperor, and he and Mulan are directed by the emperor to escort his three daughters to a conflicting kingdom in hopes that an arranged marriage between them and the three princes of the opposing nation will bring peace. He and Mulan go through many conflicts around their relationship thanks to Mushu's meddling, and midway through the film, he is assumed dead after falling into a [[canyon]] with streaming [[river]] further down. Later, when it is revealed he is alive (with help from his gray-spotted white horse), [[List of Mulan characters#Mushu|Mushu]] and Cri-Kee saves the day by pretending to be the Golden Dragon of Unity and freeing the princesses from their vows.  Mushu (still posing as the Golden Dragon) marries Mulan and Shang.  Mulan later tells Shang about Mushu and he combines both families\u2019 temples so that Mushu can remain as Mulan's guardian.\n\nNote: In [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Chinese)|Chinese naming convention]], personal names in Chinese, unlike Western names, present the family/clan name first.  This convention was followed in the first film; his family name was given to be Li and he was addressed as \"Captain Li.\"  In the second film, the convention was overlooked and Shang was used as his family name by mistake.\n\nIn [[Mulan (2020 film)|the upcoming 2020 live-action film]], a similar character is portrayed by [[Yoson An]], called '''Chen Honghui''', a confident and ambitious recruit who joins Commander Tung's unit. He becomes Mulan's most important ally and eventual love interest. His militaristic characteristics were incorporated into Commander Tung as the filmmakers found it uncomfortable for Mulan to have a relationship with a commanding officer, as a result of the [[Me Too movement]] following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases|allegations of sex crimes by Harvey Weinstein]].<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n===Mushu===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #59E\n| name               = Mushu\n| first              = ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998)\n| creator            = Robert D.

He is the only creature that talks. He is a scrawny, tiny, red, orange-accented [[Chinese dragon]] with blue horns and a cheeky-chappy personality. He is voiced by [[Eddie Murphy]] in his first appearance and [[Mark Moseley (actor)|Mark Moseley]] (a professional Eddie Murphy impressionist) afterward.\n\nAt first, Mulan's companions were to be two reptilian creatures; the idea of the creatures being dragons had not been established. However, feeling that two sidekicks would overcrowd the story, the animators then decided on a two-headed dragon, though they were green and grotesque. After the animators decided on a single-headed dragon, they established Mushu's physical concept. For better use, the animators shrunk Mushu to a smaller size.<ref name=drawn>From the \"Drawn to Animation\" show in the Animation Building in [[Hollywood Pictures Backlot]] at [[Disney California Adventure Park]].  An animator shows Mushu's development, from a sketched idea to the finished product.</ref>\n\nAround the time when the music of the film was to be created, the songwriters had written a piece for Mushu, for him to sing to assure Mulan that he will be there to help her. However, after Eddie Murphy came to voice the character, the character and his dynamic changed. Although the animators canceled the scene, the song was a favorite among the filmmakers.<ref>According to behind-the-scenes clips on the ''Mulan'' DVD</ref>\n\nMushu was once a [[Tutelary deity|guardian spirit]] of Mulan's family, but he has been demoted to the unappreciated position of an incense burner and gong-ringer for the deceased Fa ancestors ever since he failed to protect a family member, a soldier named Fa Deng, resulting in the soldier's demise by [[decapitation]] (he's seen carrying his own head as a spirit). In contrast to Mulan, Mushu is in most situations more zany, impulsive, and enthusiastic.<ref name=archive>{{cite web | work=Disney Archives | title=Mushu Character History|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/mushu/mushu.html}}</ref>\n\nHe strives to be one of the family guardians again, but he is content to help Mulan, even if he's the one who starts the trouble.<ref name=archive /> He can also be selfish at times, but his [[hero]]ism proves that he has a good heart.<ref name=archive /> Mushu is very sensitive about his size, claiming to Mulan that his small stature was simply for her convenience rather than his default state. He also hates being mistaken for a lizard, insisting that he doesn't do \"that tongue thing\".\n\nHe has the body of a snake, the horns of an elk, the claws of an eagle, and the face of a camel, coming to resemble a legendary dragon found in Chinese art around the time.<ref name=drawn /> He is able to survive more like a mythical creature than an animal; he endures being stomped on, being caught in explosions, and (literally) riding out an avalanche in the first movie. He can also understand other animals, as seen when he converses with Cri-kee (Mulan's cricket) and horse Khan.\n\nAt one point when he wants to disguise as a soldier riding a horse to get them out of the camp, he uses a [[giant panda]] as the soldier's steed after Khan, Mulan's horse, refused to help him and Cri-kee. Like many dragons, he is able to breathe fire, at first unsuccessfully, but masters it in time to stop Shan Yu's falcon, Hayabusa, from alerting the Huns to Li Shang's presence.\n\nAt the start of the film, Mushu does not make his official appearance until after Mulan runs away from home to serve in her elderly father Fa Zhou's place in a war against the deadly Hun army. Knowing that Mulan's exposure will lead to the disgrace of the Fa family, the spirits of the ancestors choose to send the Great Stone Dragon to retrieve her. For the task of awakening him, they send Mushu, who would rather go himself.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, he eventually ends up accidentally destroying the dragon statue. In order to escape punishment from the ancestors, he pretends to be the Great Stone Dragon and secretly sets out to make Mulan a war hero. Mushu is extremely diligent and with the help of Cri-kee, helps Mulan defeat Shan-Yu, resulting in him being returned to the position of a guardian.\n\nIn ''[[Mulan II]]'', Mushu serves as an antagonist, though he redeems himself at the end. When Mulan prepares to marry Li Shang, Mushu is at first overjoyed to the point of tears, going as far as planning the wedding himself. His happiness is short-lived, however, when the ancestors gleefully inform him that once Mulan marries Shang, she will become part of his family, and Shang's family guardians will take over guardianship; Mushu would thus lose his status and be demoted back to Gong duty. Desperate to keep his pedestal, he continuously tries to break Mulan and Shang apart while Cri-kee attempts to thwart his attempts. After Cri-kee pressures him to tell the truth to Mulan, this leads her to scold him for his actions before going to reconcile with Shang. \n\nHe later changes his ways, weds them (pretending to be the golden dragon), and decides that he's happy if Mulan's happy. His sacrifice causes Mulan to forgive him for trying to break her and Shang up. He even brings the peace of the kingdom by uniting Shang and Mulan. Mushu also uses his impersonation to save three princesses from being forced into an arranged marriage so they can marry whoever they want. He is then gratified when Shang combines the family temples, allowing Mushu to keep his pedestal.\n\nMushu will not appear in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], but at least some of his role in the narrative will be taken by a [[Fenghuang|phoenix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hypebae.com/2019/7/mulan-disney-live-action-remake-movie-2020-mushu-replaced-by-phoenix}}</ref>\n\nMushu also appears in the ''Drawn to Animation'' show at [[Disney California Adventure Park]]'s ''Disney Animation'' building and [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]'s [[The Magic of Disney Animation]]. He is also a [[meetable character]] at the parks.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Cri-Kee===\n'''Cri-Kee''' is a \"lucky\" cricket that was given to Mulan while getting her ready to meet the Matchmaker. He is first seen in possession of Grandmother Fa, who crosses a road while covering her eyes to demonstrate Cri-kee's ability; however, his actions lead the Matchmaker to reject Mulan. Afterward, Mulan lets Cri-kee go, but he continues to follow her and later befriends Mushu before joining him on his mission to protect Mulan. During an ambush by the Huns, he and Mushu were nearly killed when the wagon that they're in catches fire and explodes and Cri-kee follows Mulan (who has picked up Mushu while fleeing). Mushu later rescues him from an avalanche that Mulan caused to wipe out the Huns. After Mulan is expelled from the army, Cri-kee finally confesses that he isn't a lucky cricket at all. Despite this, he and Mushu help Mulan stop Shan Yu and save the Emperor, leading Mushu to deem him a lucky bug after all. In the second film, he becomes an enemy to Mushu when he tries to break up Shang and Mulan to keep his job. Cri-kee does whatever he can to foil Mushu's plans and ensure that the duo stays together, even after Mushu causes an accident that results in the destruction of a carriage that Mulan and Shang are using to transport the Emperor's daughters. Later in a canyon, Cri-kee forces Mushu to tell the truth and later becomes friends with Mushu again at the end. He will not appear in the upcoming 2020 live-action remake. He is voiced by [[Frank Welker]].\n\n===Shan Yu===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #6DA4B6\n| name               = Shan Yu\n| caption            = Shan Yu as he appears in ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''\n| first              = '''''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''''' (1998)\n| creator            = Robert D.

He is voiced by [[Miguel Ferrer]] in ''Mulan''. Shan Yu is the cruel leader of the Huns who is bent on conquering China, and with his Hun army, climbs over the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and invades the land to prove his \"superiority\" to the Emperor. He is the only Hun to have eyes with black scleras and orange irises.\n\nAs his people, Shan Yu is trained in living off the earth, possessing heightened senses and a [[saker falcon]] as his pet. His strength is demonstrated many times during the course of the film, such as easily breaking down a barricaded door or effortlessly slicing through a massive pillar with his sword, making him easily one of the strongest characters in the film (second perhaps only to Chien-Po). Ruthless and cold-hearted, Shan Yu kills without mercy or remorse and, on occasion, as a joke; for example, after freeing two captured Chinese scouts to carry a message to the Emperor, he then comments to an archer, \"How many men does it take to deliver a message?\" (The archer replies \"one\", nocking an arrow.) While clearly heartless to his foes, he is proud of his army, as shown at the beginning when he thought it was perfect that all of China knew him and his army were thereafter the signal fire was lit and when he flatly refused to avoid the Imperial troops and instead opt to take them head on, despite knowing that they are the elite of China's armies.\n\nSometime after General Li's recruits complete their training, Shan Yu's falcon acquires a doll from a village in the Tung Shao Pass. After close examination of the doll and traces on it by his five main men, Shan Yu deduces that the Imperial Army is waiting for them. Ambushing General Li's army, Shan-Yu wipes out the Emperor's best troops, including General Li, and sets the village on fire, only the aftermath of which is seen in the film. No survivors are found by Li Shang's troops. As they head for the Imperial City, the Hun army ambushes Li Shang's troops in the Tung Shao Pass (Mushu having accidentally given away their position by firing a cannon), and fires flaming arrows from the mountains to disintegrate the army's ammunition. Shan-Yu then leads his entire army to wipe out Li Shang's small battalion. Mulan, however, takes control of Li Shang's last cannon, aiming it for a nearby mountain. This maneuver triggers an avalanche that wipes out almost all of Shan-Yu's army and encases Shan Yu in a blanket of snow. At first, it seems like a victory, thanks to Mulan. Unfortunately, it is not. Following the avalanche and the departure of Li Shang's troops, Shan Yu rises from the snow, shaken and infuriated at the loss of his army. A loud yell of anger is all it takes for Mulan to realize that there is still a chance for the Huns; Shan Yu's pet falcon and five of his best troops had survived the assault. With no one to stop him, Shan Yu and his troops head for the Imperial City with Mulan close behind.\n\nWhile his troops hide within a Chinese dragon at the Imperial celebration, Shan Yu lies in wait on top of the roof of the Emperor's palace. At the right moment, Shan Yu's falcon retrieves his sword and his troops spring into action, locking up the palace and kidnapping the Emperor. As Shan Yu threatens the Emperor to bow to him, Mulan, Li Shang, Yao, Chien-Pao, and Ling infiltrate the palace in an attempt to rescue the Emperor, the latter three being in drag (as a disguise).  Mulan, Yao, Chien-Po, and Ling defeat Shan Yu's men and his pet falcon is fried by Mushu. After securing the Emperor, in an attempt to distract Shan Yu from Shang (whom he was about to slaughter) Mulan reveals that it was she who destroyed his army. Pursuing her throughout the palace and onto the roof, Shan-Yu's attempt to kill Mulan backfires when Mulan initiates a plan of her own. Immobilizing Shan-Yu on the roof, she steals his sword using a hand fan and pins him to the roof with his own sword while Mushu aims a rocket at Shan Yu. Releasing the rocket, Mushu, Mulan, and Crik-ee escape the roof as the Hun leader is pulled by the rocket into a munitions tower and is destroyed in a brilliant explosion. Mulan is then awarded Shan-Yu's sword for her success at ridding China of the Huns forever.\n\n\nIn an earlier story treatment written by Barry Cook, Shan Yu was originally intended to return in Mulan II where he and his deceased army, all are ghosts now, would have started to haunt Northern China, prompting the Emperor to send Mulan and Shang there. The finale would have involved Shan Yu's ghost army even himself fighting against Mulan and her allies, including the Fa Family Ancestors\n\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Jason Scott Lee]] and is known as '''Bori Khan''', a warrior leader allied with a powerful witch who is intent on avenging his father's death. He will be the secondary antagonist in the movie. Instead of being Hun, Khan will be of [[Rouran Khaganate|Rouran]] descent.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />\n\n===Yao, Ling and Chien-Po===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #59E\n| name               = Yao, Ling and Chien-Po\n| first              = '''''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''''' (1998)\n| creator            = Robert D.

Like other newly recruited soldiers, they lacked military skills before they were trained. However, they were harder to train than most. Even [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]] learned faster than they. Eventually, their training paid off and the trio were capable fighters. Even so, they still had trouble doing things right and were rather clumsy. They served largely as the [[comic relief]], often involving [[slapstick]] humor that made them reminiscent of [[the Three Stooges]]. Eventually, despite some early conflict, the three extended an open hand to Mulan and became her \"army buddies\", though they, like the rest of the army, though she was a man named Ping. As soldiers, they each had a different color uniform: green for Mulan, red for Yao, yellow for Ling and blue for Chien-Po. Unlike most other soldiers, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po did not seem to think any less of her when they found out she was a woman, and even briefly tried to interfere when Shang was about to execute her. When they later met up, they even agreed to participate in her plan to stop the surviving Huns by disguising themselves as [[Concubinage|concubine]]s. Somehow, they fooled the guards, though none of the three made a very attractive woman (especially Yao, as he kept his facial hair even in makeup).\n\nIn the second film, the three were given a more substantial role and are shown not to have changed since the first film. Reprised by the original voice actors (sans Wilder; Watanabe did his own singing), they had been to see the matchmaker that rejected Mulan in the first film, but she decided there could not be a match for any of them and threw them out. They were discouraged but felt better when Mulan and [[Li Shang (Mulan character)|Li Shang]] came to recruit them for another mission. Shang claimed to the emperor that just the five of them would be enough protection for his three daughters. Although still as bumbling as ever, Shang knew that they were instrumental in their victory against the Huns, which they did not appear to have received the same credit for. They gladly joined the escort to get the emperor's daughters to the Qui Gong princes they are engaged to. Along the way, they develop feelings for the princesses, Yao with Mei, Ling with Ting-Ting, and Chien-Po with Su. They take the princesses to a carnival for some amusement. Eventually, all three princesses admit that their feeling is mutual, and do not want to marry the princes, despite their duty. Mulan, knowing this, leaves the trio with the princesses, and goes to offer herself to the royal family instead. However, the trio arrives with the princesses, as does Shang. [[Mushu]] pretends to be the Great Golden Dragon of Unity who commands that they are allowed to marry whoever they want, allowing them to be with Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po. Presumably, they did marry, though nothing was shown to indicate this.\n\n====Yao====\n'''Yao''' is the self-appointed leader of the trio. His signature color is [[red]] in the first film and [[purple]] in the second film. An arrogant and short-tempered individual with a bit of a [[Napoleon complex]], he is short, stocky and has a permanent black eye. In the first film, he enjoys picking on Mulan for fun at first but eventually becomes her friend. His clumsiness reveals, however, that he is not as powerful a man as he claims to be. He states about wanting a girl who'd admire his strength and battle scars.\n\nIn the second film, he reveals a rewarding [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] that has a picture of himself on his chest and falls in love with Princess Mei, the emperor's middle daughter. She accepted the idea that \"my duty is to my heart\" and is the easiest to be won over. In his encounter, he puts the slipper back onto her foot and sets the table for her with [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[baozi|meat bun]]s and [[tea]]. He wanted to marry a girl who would be impressed with his looks and his fighting ability. Although such traits leave something to be desired, he managed to impress her, and when he wins a fight at a carnival and is given a prize, he chooses a stuffed [[giant panda|panda bear]] with three black legs and one white leg and gives it to her.\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Chen Tang (actor)|Chen Tang]].\n\n====Ling====\n'''Ling''' is the group's middleman of medium height and very slim build. His signature color is [[yellow]] in the first film and [[blue]] in the second film. He is a friendly and enthusiastic man with a joke for every occasion. Though he teases Mulan at first, he, like the other two, becomes her friend. He and Yao occasionally have disagreements, but he grows to accept him as their leader. He was the one who coined the phrase \"a girl worth fighting for.\"\n\nIn the second film, he falls in love with Princess Ting-Ting, the eldest princess. She is the most uptight princess, devoted to honor, and tries be a role model to her sisters. Ling, who wanted a girl who would laugh at his jokes (even knowing the chopstick nose trick that Ling believes to have invented), had to try harder than his partners to impress her. Unlike most people, Ting-Ting is amused by his puns, but would not laugh, claiming to dislike laughter, though the reason is that she thinks her snorting laugh is embarrassing. He begins to doubt himself. However, at the carnival, when some fireflies accidentally set off firecrackers that hit Ling, she cannot contain herself at his misfortune. She snorts, but Ling doesn't mind and thinks it's cute. At the end, they are able to get married because of Mushu.\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Jimmy Wong]].\n\n====Chien-Po====\n'''Chien-Po''', or '''Po''' for short, is by far the tallest and most obese of Mulan's friends with a bald head. His signature color is [[blue]] in the first film and [[green]] in the second film. He is the calmest and most spiritual of the three, and his appearance seems to have been inspired by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] imagery. He is rather na\u00efve compared to his partners, and loves food more than anything, which is the main thing he considers when searching for a woman for he wishes for a wife that will be good at cooking and preparing food. He is very good-natured and would never do anything to upset anyone, making him the most ready to befriend Mulan. He also possesses great strength and can lift multiple people (or a massive stone statue) with ease.\n\nIn the second film, he falls in love with Princess Su, the youngest sister. The most childlike, she is easily swayed and is soon convinced of Mei's opinions. She loves food as much as Chien-Po, and when the group stops traveling for a while, she spends her time picking fruit from trees. Chien-Po discovers this, and the two of them bond easily. He even saves her when the carriage ends up falling in the water. At the carnival, they both order some [[dumpling]]s, [[ginger]], [[Ginseng]]s and [[soybean]]s.\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Doua Moua]].\n\n==Characters from ''Mulan''==\n\n===The Fa family===\n====Fa Zhou====\n'''Fa Zhou''' is Mulan's father who is very strict and also a famed war veteran who got injured in war. At first glance he seems like he only cares about the honor of the family and that he is quick to frustration with Mulan. He first appears putting an incense stick on the hanging dish and praying to the honorable ancestors while Mulan is seeing the matchmaker. Nothing distracts him from his prayers, even when [[chicken]]s go running around in the shrine to crazily devour the [[chicken feed]]. When Chi-Fu calls him from the Fa family for military duty, he puts down the cane, stands straight and accepts his assignment scroll, not caring about his old crippled body despite his limping and visible pain. Mulan worries that he is risking his life, especially after seeing him collapse after some sword exercises. When Mulan returns in a triumph of defeating Shan Yu, she gives him Shan Yu's sword with the blade wrapped in cloth and the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the emperor; the two gifts that honor the Fa Family. On receiving these gifts, he immediately puts them down and confesses that all he ever wanted was Mulan to be happy and safe, informing her that his greatest honor is having her as a daughter. He was voiced by [[Soon-Tek Oh]].\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Tzi Ma]].<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />\n====Fa Li====\n'''Fa Li''' is Mulan's mother. She initially stays with the dresser waiting for Mulan to come. She is frustrated when her daughter's hair is messed with [[hay]] and sends her inside to have her bathed and cleaned up. She and all the dressers help her get dressed after the bath. After they have finished beautifying Mulan, she sends her to the impatient matchmaker who then gets enraged by Mulan's accidents. Fa Li consoles her after the matchmaker rejects her. During the rainy night, she weeps for her daughter who runs away with Khan the horse, and her husband Fa Zhou consoles her while watching over her at the same time. When Li Shang shows up in the middle of a conversation between Fa Li and Grandmother Fa about Mulan's war exploits and that she should've brought a man home, Fa Li is left stunned. According to her second film, the only other child she likes is Sha-Ron (a faux-Chinese version of the name [[Sharon (disambiguation)|Sharon]]), a little girl who wears a lavender outfit and [[bun (hairstyle)#Double bun|ox-horns]]. She was voiced by [[Freda Foh Shen]].\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action film]], she is portrayed by [[Rosalind Chao]].<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />\n\n====Grandmother Fa====\n'''Grandmother Fa''' is Mulan's grandmother. She is very easy-going and gives Mulan the most freedom. She also provides comic relief in the family. She is first seen holding a cage with Cri-Kee in it. She covers her eyes while crossing a road and demonstrates the ability to show how lucky this cricket is. After Fa Li and all the dressers have finished beautifying Mulan, Grandma Fa gives her a few items to make her look perfect (apple, pendant, jade necklace and Cri-Kee). She constantly encourages her to find a good husband. During the rainy night, she recognizes that her granddaughter has run away to join the army in her father's place, and she picks up a [[lantern]] and prays to the ancestors, awakening First Ancestor Fa. When Mulan returns home with Shan Yu's sword and the Emperor's crest, she comments that Mulan should have brought a man home and is shocked when Li Shang arrives, causing her to jokingly say to sign her up for the next war.  When Mulan asks Shang to stay for dinner, she asks him to stay forever. Mulan is shown to be fondly annoyed by this but Shang does agree to stay for dinner. In her second film, she plays a game in the house of Fa and brings in food for the perfect couple Mulan and Shang. Her speaking voice is provided by [[June Foray]] and her singing voice is provided by [[Marni Nixon]].\n\n====First Ancestor Fa====\n'''First Ancestor Fa''' is the ghostly eldest member of the Fa family and acts as leader of the ancestors. He carries a staff with him. When he is summoned, he brings Mushu to life by saying the word \"awaken\". He usually stops the other ancestors from fighting and requests (what he thinks are) better plans such as summoning the Great Stone Dragon. When Mushu returns with Mulan, he gives him his job as a guardian again, though showing a frustrated face. At the beginning of his second film, he performs something interesting with the forming of smoke. He was voiced by [[George Takei]].\n\n=====Other Ancestors=====\n'''Other Ancestors''', members of the company including the farmer and his wife (a parody of the famous painting [[American Gothic]]), and the counter who is always fiddling with his [[abacus]]. Fa Deng is the only ancestor whose head is cut off, a result of Mushu's misguidance to him when he was a guardian. Many of these ancestors clamor about Mulan when she's away. [[Mary Kay Bergman]] did the voice of the female ancestors in the first film and in the second film, they are voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].\n\n===Khan===\n'''Khan''' is Mulan's [[horse]] with a [[black]] coat and [[white]] markings on his face, belly and legs. He is portrayed as a very intelligent and confident horse. When he first saw Mushu, he tried to kill him with his hooves out of fear. In the first film, during the surprise ambush on the mountains, Mulan causes an [[avalanche]] killing many Huns. Khan risks his life to save Mulan and tries his best to run to safety before he almost falls to his death off the cliff. He also seems to be very close to Mulan but doesn't like Mushu so much. In the second film, he gets angry at Mushu who tries to break Mulan and Shang up after his [[saddle]] is unbuckled and in one of his attempts, he injures him by stomping on him with his [[Horse hoof|hooves]] as payback. Khan is voiced by [[Frank Welker]].\n\nHe will appear in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]].\n\n===Little Brother===\n'''Little Brother''' is Mulan's pet dog. He has a blue [[Dog collar|collar]] around his neck. Mulan often uses him to spread chicken feeds by hanging a bone in front of him, similar to the [[carrot on a stick]] trick. He is voiced by [[Chris Sanders]] in the first movie and [[Frank Welker]] in the second movie.\n\n===The Emperor of China===\nBased on the real-life emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]], this character is shown as the wisest of all China. He lives in a palace (modeled, perhaps anachronistically, upon the [[Forbidden City]]) and he has a long mustache and beard. [[Yellow]] is the color that he wears. In his first film, when everybody's ambushed, he gets captured by Shan Yu and his henchmen resulting his hat to fall off, but then with Mulan and Shang, in order to save him, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (disguised as concubines) trick Shan Yu's henchmen into being attracted to them and so dropping their guard. After Shan Yu is terminated, the emperor comes down the steps and, though he sternly reprimands Mulan for impersonating a soldier, he then thanks her for saving their beloved country. He is the first person to bow to her, and even offers her a position on his council, but Mulan politely declines the offer by saying that she feels she should return to her family. In gratitude, he takes off his crest and puts it on her neck and gives Shan Yu's sword to her as tokens for her efforts, the crest representing what she did for him while the sword represents what she did for China. After she leaves, he puts his hat back on and tells Li Shang to go after her, noting that \"You don't meet a girl like that every [[dynasty|dynas-day]]\". His role is a little smaller in the second film, where he suggests Mulan and Shang to take his daughters to Qui-Gong as part of the mission.\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Jet Li]].\n\n===Chi-Fu===\n'''Chi-Fu''' is a member of the Emperor's council and adviser to Li Shang who refuses to allow the recruits to join the battle against the Huns and serves as a minor antagonist of the film. He is shown to harbor substantial prejudice towards women. He is most often clad in [[Blue]] and places considerable importance on his clothing. He is shown to be devoted to his job and loyal to the Emperor, but is incompetent, [[egotism|egotistic]], pompous and [[misogyny|misogynistic]], as he silences Mulan and tells Fa Zhou to teach her silence in a man's presence, orders Li Shang to execute her once her secret is revealed, despite her saving everyone, and close to the film's conclusion pompously scoffs to Shang that Mulan would never be worth anything because she's a woman. At the end of the film, as the Emperor praises Mulan for defeating Shan-Yu and saving China, he tells Chi-Fu to arrange Mulan for membership in his council. Still believing that Mulan isn't worth anything because she is a woman, Chi-Fu attempts to dissuade him from doing so by claiming that there are no more available seats in the council, but this backfires when the Emperor tells Mulan she can have Chi-Fu's job, causing him to faint. He does not appear in ''Mulan II'', but it is shown that someone strikingly similar to Chi-Fu is a royal adviser to Lord Qin of [[Qigong]]. He was voiced by [[James Hong]].\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he will be replaced by '''The Chancellor''' (portrayed by [[Nelson Lee]]).\n\n===General Li===\n'''General Li''' was Li Shang's father and a high-ranking member of the Chinese army who was killed along with his elite troops in a battle against the Hun army, leaving his helmet behind to be found by his son and his battalion when they discover the aftermath. He was voiced by [[James Shigeta]].\n\n===The Matchmaker===\nThis character is an impatient and harsh woman, who obnoxiously judges potential brides. After the musical number called \"Honor To Us All,\" she opens the doors, calls Mulan's name and takes her inside. She distastefully judges Mulan, calling her too skinny, and asks her to pour the tea as the second part of the test. Cri-Kee, who attempts to escape, ends up in the Matchmaker's cup of tea, and when Mulan tries to take the cup back, The Matchmaker falls on the floor where Cri-Kee gets into the clothing and when she gets up to tell Mulan what happened, she notices that Cri-Kee is in her clothing, causing her to crash into a stove, lighting her backside on burning embers; Mulan tries to extinguish with a paper fan, but the hot embers turn into fire, which Mulan manages to extinguish by pouring the tea on her. Blaming Mulan for the troubles, she publicly humiliates her and says that she will never bring any honor to her family being a wife. She also called Mulan a disgrace when the Matchmaker was the real disgrace. Grandmother Fa noticed her as a little stinker. The second film reveals that she's \"smug and snooty,\" as accused by Ling, which causes her to throw a [[Pottery|pot]] onto his head as she flings out the masculine trio. She is voiced by [[Miriam Margolyes]] in the first film and [[April Winchell]] in the second film.\n\nShe will appear in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]] and be portrayed by [[Cheng Pei-pei]].\n\n===Hayabusa===\nHayabusa is Shan Yu's pet [[saker falcon]], who acts as his master's eyes and ears from the distance. At the end of the first film, his feathers are burned down by a fireball from Mushu to stop him from warning the Huns of Li Shang's presence, who then taunts him as \"[[Mongolian barbecue|Mongolian barbeque]]\" while Cri-kee laughs at him. He isn't seen afterward.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Hayabusa appears in the boss battle against Shan Yu. He can grab Sora, lift him into the air, and throw him.\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action film]], Hayabusa has been replaced by '''Xian Lang''' (portrayed by [[Gong Li]]), a powerful witch allied with Bori Khan who can transform herself into a falcon. She will be the main antagonist of the film.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />\n\n==Characters from ''Mulan II''==\n\n===Daughters of the Emperor of China===\nThe Emperor of China's three children that are known anyway; Ting-Ting, Mei and Su are princesses. He sends them into the [[carriage]] to complete the mission which is to marry the Princes of Qui Gong hiding their pretty faces with [[Fan (implement)|paper fan]]s. When in the carriage, these princesses begin to panic as Mushu causes it to slide down by banging his head on the wheel.\n\n*'''Ting-Ting''' is the eldest daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is [[indigo]] and she is taller than both of her sisters. After Mushu has caused the carriage to slide down, she forces her younger sisters out and tries to escape, but her foot is stuck only to be saved by Ling and the carriage breaks afterward. When she hears his jokes, she thinks they are funny but she tries not to laugh, as she has an embarrassing snorting laugh. However, when the [[firecracker]]s lit by the [[firefly|fireflies]] hit him, she laughs, which causes her to snort like a pig, which Ling thought was cute. Ting-Ting appears as mature and level-headed but is actually carefree in her heart. Her speaking voice is provided by Canadian award-winning actress [[Sandra Oh]] and her singing voice is provided by [[Judy Kuhn]]. She is Crown Princess of China and one day to be ''Her Majesty'' The Empress of China.\n\n*'''Mei''' is the middle daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is [[pink]] and she is in between her sisters in height. She likes to get along with Yao because she thinks he is good-looking and gentle at heart. She is convinced by Mulan that her duty is to her heart and she knows that it is true. Frustrated by her older sister, she drops her fan to get in the tent and writes, \"And so, my dear father, I cannot complete this mission. I have come to realize that my duty is to my heart.\" When Yao has won a wrestling fight, he chooses the stuffed [[Giant panda|panda bear]] and he shares it with her. Considered a slight [[Damsel in distress|damsel-in-distress]], she has been kidnapped by the enemies of China when the heroes have been knocked down during their fight but saved by her friends. Mei is passionate, brave and caring. Her speaking voice is provided by [[Lucy Liu]] and her singing voice is provided by Beth Blankenship.\n\n*'''Su''' is the youngest daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and she is shorter than both of her sisters. Her favorite thing to do is gathering food from the trees and she likes to spend time with Chien-Po who likes food also. When the carriage is damaged and the [[fruit]] floats in the water, she picks them up again and she gets saved by him too. She is bright, childish and cheerful. Her speaking voice is provided by [[Lauren Tom]] and her singing voice is provided by [[Mandy Gonzalez]].\n\n===Sha-Ron===\n'''Sha-Ron''' is a very excited little girl. She first visits Fa Li and says that she wants to see Mulan, who's practicing kung-fu with a rake. Then as she goes outside and drops the [[bucket]]s down, she and all of the other excited daughters of the villagers meet her and get trained on how to fight enemies as so during the \"Lesson Number One\" musical number. Then as General Shang arrives, she takes his helmet with more excitement and runs home. She is voiced by Jillian Henry.\n\n===Lord Qin and Prince Jeeki===\n'''Lord Qin''' is the priest of [[Qigong]]. When Mulan is about to complete the mission, he allows her to marry his son '''Prince Jeeki''' who likes playing with the [[Chinese finger trap]]. As Lord Qin engages Mulan and his son, their wedding is interrupted and he makes Shang go away until the Golden Dragon of Unity begins to talk with Mushu's voice. He timidly allows Mulan and Shang to marry each other and then begins to play with the fingertip Jeeki used to play with. Lord Qin is voiced by  [[Keone Young]] and Prince Jeeki is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]].\n\n==Characters from ''Mulan'' (2020 film)==\n===Commander Tung===\n'''Commander Tung''' (portrayed by [[Donnie Yen]]), a mentor and teacher to Mulan who leads the Imperial Regiment. The character is actually also partially based on Li Shang.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/mulan-changes-live-action-animated-version-disney/|title=\u2018Mulan\u2019: The Biggest Changes from the Animated Version in Disney\u2019s Live-Action Remake|website=Collider|last=Szany|first=Wendy Lee|date=February 27, 2020|accessdate=February 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Hua Xiu===\n'''Hua Xiu''' (portrayed by Xana Tang), is the sister of [[Mulan (Disney character)|Hua Mulan]] and the second daughter of Hua Zhou and Hua Li.

She enters the army as a man named Ping. She faces the worst enemy China's ever seen, the Hun leader Shan-Yu, who has an army willing to destroy anything in their path. She succeeds in fighting them and saves all of China single-handedly without any help whatsoever . The Emperor of China awards her for her effort and the whole of China celebrate her return.\n\nIn [[Mulan (2020 film)|the upcoming 2020 live-action film]], Mulan's surname will be changed \"Hua (\u82b1),\" the traditional surname of Mulan, and will assume the pseudonym \"Hua Jun\" during her time in the army.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />\n\n===Li Shang===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #59E\n| name               = Captain/General Li Shang\n| image              =\n| creator            = Robert D.

His speaking voice was provided by [[B.D. Wong]] in all three titles, and his singing vocals were performed by [[Donny Osmond]] ([[Jackie Chan]] in the Cantonese version). During his appointment in the first movie, Shang is a highly capable leader with a dedication to his cause to match, albeit at times being too \"by-the-book\" and putting his duty above his feelings, in contrast to Mulan. He is exceptionally handsome due to his dashing good looks and strong physique. He is reserved and thoughtful, a more logical and calming influence to Mulan's adventurous personality.  Shortly after his initial introduction in ''Mulan'', Shang is appointed newly as an army captain by his father, who is a general. Later through the film, he becomes friends with Ping (who is Fa Mulan disguised as a man), after his life is saved. Shortly after, however, he finds out she is actually a woman, which is forbidden by the empire's law, punishable by death. Shang spares her life, and after helping her save the empire, he falls in love with her and joins her family for dinner. \n\nIn ''[[Mulan II]]'', the film begins with Shang proposing marriage to Mulan, to which she gladly agrees. He is promoted from captain to general by the emperor, and he and Mulan are directed by the emperor to escort his three daughters to a conflicting kingdom in hopes that an arranged marriage between them and the three princes of the opposing nation will bring peace. He and Mulan go through many conflicts around their relationship thanks to Mushu's meddling, and midway through the film, he is assumed dead after falling into a [[canyon]] with streaming [[river]] further down. Later, when it is revealed he is alive (with help from his gray-spotted white horse), [[List of Mulan characters#Mushu|Mushu]] and Cri-Kee saves the day by pretending to be the Golden Dragon of Unity and freeing the princesses from their vows.  Mushu (still posing as the Golden Dragon) marries Mulan and Shang.  Mulan later tells Shang about Mushu and he combines both families\u2019 temples so that Mushu can remain as Mulan's guardian.\n\nNote: In [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Chinese)|Chinese naming convention]], personal names in Chinese, unlike Western names, present the family/clan name first.  This convention was followed in the first film; his family name was given to be Li and he was addressed as \"Captain Li.\"  In the second film, the convention was overlooked and Shang was used as his family name by mistake.\n\nIn [[Mulan (2020 film)|the upcoming 2020 live-action film]], a similar character is portrayed by [[Yoson An]], called '''Chen Honghui''', a confident and ambitious recruit who joins Commander Tung's unit. He becomes Mulan's most important ally and eventual love interest. His militaristic characteristics were incorporated into Commander Tung as the filmmakers found it uncomfortable for Mulan to have a relationship with a commanding officer, as a result of the [[Me Too movement]] following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases|the allegations of sex crimes by Harvey Weinstein]].<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n===Mushu===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #59E\n| name               = Mushu\n| first              = ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998)\n| creator            = Robert D.

He is the only creature that talks. He is a scrawny, tiny, red, orange-accented [[Chinese dragon]] with blue horns and a cheeky-chappy personality. He is voiced by [[Eddie Murphy]] in his first appearance and [[Mark Moseley (actor)|Mark Moseley]] (a professional Eddie Murphy impressionist) afterward.\n\nAt first, Mulan's companions were to be two reptilian creatures; the idea of the creatures being dragons had not been established. However, feeling that two sidekicks would overcrowd the story, the animators then decided on a two-headed dragon, though they were green and grotesque. After the animators decided on a single-headed dragon, they established Mushu's physical concept. For better use, the animators shrunk Mushu to a smaller size.<ref name=drawn>From the \"Drawn to Animation\" show in the Animation Building in [[Hollywood Pictures Backlot]] at [[Disney California Adventure Park]].  An animator shows Mushu's development, from a sketched idea to the finished product.</ref>\n\nAround the time when the music of the film was to be created, the songwriters had written a piece for Mushu, for him to sing to assure Mulan that he will be there to help her. However, after Eddie Murphy came to voice the character, the character and his dynamic changed. Although the animators canceled the scene, the song was a favorite among the filmmakers.<ref>According to behind-the-scenes clips on the ''Mulan'' DVD</ref>\n\nMushu was once a [[Tutelary deity|guardian spirit]] of Mulan's family, but he has been demoted to the unappreciated position of an incense burner and gong-ringer for the deceased Fa ancestors ever since he failed to protect a family member, a soldier named Fa Deng, resulting in the soldier's demise by [[decapitation]] (he's seen carrying his own head as a spirit). In contrast to Mulan, Mushu is in most situations more zany, impulsive, and enthusiastic.<ref name=archive>{{cite web | work=Disney Archives | title=Mushu Character History|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/mushu/mushu.html}}</ref>\n\nHe strives to be one of the family guardians again, but he is content to help Mulan, even if he's the one who starts the trouble.<ref name=archive /> He can also be selfish at times, but his [[hero]]ism proves that he has a good heart.<ref name=archive /> Mushu is very sensitive about his size, claiming to Mulan that his small stature was simply for her convenience rather than his default state. He also hates being mistaken for a lizard, insisting that he doesn't do \"that tongue thing\".\n\nHe has the body of a snake, the horns of an elk, the claws of an eagle, and the face of a camel, coming to resemble a legendary dragon found in Chinese art around the time.<ref name=drawn /> He is able to survive more like a mythical creature than an animal; he endures being stomped on, being caught in explosions, and (literally) riding out an avalanche in the first movie. He can also understand other animals, as seen when he converses with Cri-kee (Mulan's cricket) and horse Khan.\n\nAt one point when he wants to disguise as a soldier riding a horse to get them out of the camp, he uses a [[giant panda]] as the soldier's steed after Khan, Mulan's horse, refused to help him and Cri-kee. Like many dragons, he is able to breathe fire, at first unsuccessfully, but masters it in time to stop Shan Yu's falcon, Hayabusa, from alerting the Huns to Li Shang's presence.\n\nAt the start of the film, Mushu does not make his official appearance until after Mulan runs away from home to serve in her elderly father Fa Zhou's place in a war against the deadly Hun army. Knowing that Mulan's exposure will lead to the disgrace of the Fa family, the spirits of the ancestors choose to send the Great Stone Dragon to retrieve her. For the task of awakening him, they send Mushu, who would rather go himself.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, he eventually ends up accidentally destroying the dragon statue. In order to escape punishment from the ancestors, he pretends to be the Great Stone Dragon and secretly sets out to make Mulan a war hero. Mushu is extremely diligent and with the help of Cri-kee, helps Mulan defeat Shan-Yu, resulting in him being returned to the position of a guardian.\n\nIn ''[[Mulan II]]'', Mushu serves as an antagonist, though he redeems himself at the end. When Mulan prepares to marry Li Shang, Mushu is at first overjoyed to the point of tears, going as far as planning the wedding himself. His happiness is short-lived, however, when the ancestors gleefully inform him that once Mulan marries Shang, she will become part of his family, and Shang's family guardians will take over guardianship; Mushu would thus lose his status and be demoted back to Gong duty. Desperate to keep his pedestal, he continuously tries to break Mulan and Shang apart while Cri-kee attempts to thwart his attempts. After Cri-kee pressures him to tell the truth to Mulan, this leads her to scold him for his actions before going to reconcile with Shang. \n\nHe later changes his ways, weds them (pretending to be the golden dragon), and decides that he's happy if Mulan's happy. His sacrifice causes Mulan to forgive him for trying to break her and Shang up. He even brings the peace of the kingdom by uniting Shang and Mulan. Mushu also uses his impersonation to save three princesses from being forced into an arranged marriage so they can marry whoever they want. He is then gratified when Shang combines the family temples, allowing Mushu to keep his pedestal.\n\nMushu will not appear in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], but at least some of his role in the narrative will be taken by a [[Fenghuang|phoenix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hypebae.com/2019/7/mulan-disney-live-action-remake-movie-2020-mushu-replaced-by-phoenix}}</ref>\n\nMushu also appears in the ''Drawn to Animation'' show at [[Disney California Adventure Park]]'s ''Disney Animation'' building and [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]'s [[The Magic of Disney Animation]]. He is also a [[meetable character]] at the parks.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Cri-Kee===\n'''Cri-Kee''' is a \"lucky\" cricket that was given to Mulan while getting her ready to meet the Matchmaker. He is first seen in possession of Grandmother Fa, who crosses a road while covering her eyes to demonstrate Cri-kee's ability; however, his actions lead the Matchmaker to reject Mulan. Afterward, Mulan lets Cri-kee go, but he continues to follow her and later befriends Mushu before joining him on his mission to protect Mulan. During an ambush by the Huns, he and Mushu were nearly killed when the wagon that they're in catches fire and explodes and Cri-kee follows Mulan (who has picked up Mushu while fleeing). Mushu later rescues him from an avalanche that Mulan caused to wipe out the Huns. After Mulan is expelled from the army, Cri-kee finally confesses that he isn't a lucky cricket at all. Despite this, he and Mushu help Mulan stop Shan Yu and save the Emperor, leading Mushu to deem him a lucky bug after all. In the second film, he becomes an enemy to Mushu when he tries to break up Shang and Mulan to keep his job. Cri-kee does whatever he can to foil Mushu's plans and ensure that the duo stays together, even after Mushu causes an accident that results in the destruction of a carriage that Mulan and Shang are using to transport the Emperor's daughters. Later in a canyon, Cri-kee forces Mushu to tell the truth and later becomes friends with Mushu again at the end. He will not appear in the upcoming 2020 live-action remake. He is voiced by [[Frank Welker]].\n\n===Shan Yu===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #6DA4B6\n| name               = Shan Yu\n| caption            = Shan Yu as he appears in ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''\n| first              = '''''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''''' (1998)\n| creator            = Robert D.

He is voiced by [[Miguel Ferrer]] in ''Mulan''. Shan Yu is the cruel leader of the Huns who is bent on conquering China, and with his Hun army, climbs over the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and invades the land to prove his \"superiority\" to the Emperor. He is the only Hun to have eyes with black scleras and orange irises.\n\nAs his people, Shan Yu is trained in living off the earth, possessing heightened senses and a [[saker falcon]] as his pet. His strength is demonstrated many times during the course of the film, such as easily breaking down a barricaded door or effortlessly slicing through a massive pillar with his sword, making him easily one of the strongest characters in the film (second perhaps only to Chien-Po). Ruthless and cold-hearted, Shan Yu kills without mercy or remorse and, on occasion, as a joke; for example, after freeing two captured Chinese scouts to carry a message to the Emperor, he then comments to an archer, \"How many men does it take to deliver a message?\" (The archer replies \"one\", nocking an arrow.) While clearly heartless to his foes, he is proud of his army, as shown at the beginning when he thought it was perfect that all of China knew him and his army were thereafter the signal fire was lit and when he flatly refused to avoid the Imperial troops and instead opt to take them head on, despite knowing that they are the elite of China's armies.\n\nSometime after General Li's recruits complete their training, Shan Yu's falcon acquires a doll from a village in the Tung Shao Pass. After close examination of the doll and traces on it by his five main men, Shan Yu deduces that the Imperial Army is waiting for them. Ambushing General Li's army, Shan-Yu wipes out the Emperor's best troops, including General Li, and sets the village on fire, only the aftermath of which is seen in the film. No survivors are found by Li Shang's troops. As they head for the Imperial City, the Hun army ambushes Li Shang's troops in the Tung Shao Pass (Mushu having accidentally given away their position by firing a cannon), and fires flaming arrows from the mountains to disintegrate the army's ammunition. Shan-Yu then leads his entire army to wipe out Li Shang's small battalion. Mulan, however, takes control of Li Shang's last cannon, aiming it for a nearby mountain. This maneuver triggers an avalanche that wipes out almost all of Shan-Yu's army and encases Shan Yu in a blanket of snow. At first, it seems like a victory, thanks to Mulan. Unfortunately, it is not. Following the avalanche and the departure of Li Shang's troops, Shan Yu rises from the snow, shaken and infuriated at the loss of his army. A loud yell of anger is all it takes for Mulan to realize that there is still a chance for the Huns; Shan Yu's pet falcon and five of his best troops had survived the assault. With no one to stop him, Shan Yu and his troops head for the Imperial City with Mulan close behind.\n\nWhile his troops hide within a Chinese dragon at the Imperial celebration, Shan Yu lies in wait on top of the roof of the Emperor's palace. At the right moment, Shan Yu's falcon retrieves his sword and his troops spring into action, locking up the palace and kidnapping the Emperor. As Shan Yu threatens the Emperor to bow to him, Mulan, Li Shang, Yao, Chien-Pao, and Ling infiltrate the palace in an attempt to rescue the Emperor, the latter three being in drag (as a disguise).  Mulan, Yao, Chien-Po, and Ling defeat Shan Yu's men and his pet falcon is fried by Mushu. After securing the Emperor, in an attempt to distract Shan Yu from Shang (whom he was about to slaughter) Mulan reveals that it was she who destroyed his army. Pursuing her throughout the palace and onto the roof, Shan-Yu's attempt to kill Mulan backfires when Mulan initiates a plan of her own. Immobilizing Shan-Yu on the roof, she steals his sword using a hand fan and pins him to the roof with his own sword while Mushu aims a rocket at Shan Yu. Releasing the rocket, Mushu, Mulan, and Crik-ee escape the roof as the Hun leader is pulled by the rocket into a munitions tower and is destroyed in a brilliant explosion. Mulan is then awarded Shan-Yu's sword for her success at ridding China of the Huns forever.\n\n\nIn an earlier story treatment written by Barry Cook, Shan Yu was originally intended to return in Mulan II where he and his deceased army, all are ghosts now, would have started to haunt Northern China, prompting the Emperor to send Mulan and Shang there. The finale would have involved Shan Yu's ghost army even himself fighting against Mulan and her allies, including the Fa Family Ancestors\n\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Jason Scott Lee]] and is known as '''Bori Khan''', a warrior leader allied with a powerful witch who is intent on avenging his father's death. He will be the secondary antagonist in the movie. Instead of being Hun, Khan will be of [[Rouran Khaganate|Rouran]] descent.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />\n\n===Yao, Ling and Chien-Po===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #59E\n| name               = Yao, Ling and Chien-Po\n| first              = '''''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''''' (1998)\n| creator            = Robert D.

Like other newly recruited soldiers, they lacked military skills before they were trained. However, they were harder to train than most. Even [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]] learned faster than they. Eventually, their training paid off and the trio were capable fighters. Even so, they still had trouble doing things right and were rather clumsy. They served largely as the [[comic relief]], often involving [[slapstick]] humor that made them reminiscent of [[the Three Stooges]]. Eventually, despite some early conflict, the three extended an open hand to Mulan and became her \"army buddies\", though they, like the rest of the army, though she was a man named Ping. As soldiers, they each had a different color uniform: green for Mulan, red for Yao, yellow for Ling and blue for Chien-Po. Unlike most other soldiers, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po did not seem to think any less of her when they found out she was a woman, and even briefly tried to interfere when Shang was about to execute her. When they later met up, they even agreed to participate in her plan to stop the surviving Huns by disguising themselves as [[Concubinage|concubine]]s. Somehow, they fooled the guards, though none of the three made a very attractive woman (especially Yao, as he kept his facial hair even in makeup).\n\nIn the second film, the three were given a more substantial role and are shown not to have changed since the first film. Reprised by the original voice actors (sans Wilder; Watanabe did his own singing), they had been to see the matchmaker that rejected Mulan in the first film, but she decided there could not be a match for any of them and threw them out. They were discouraged but felt better when Mulan and [[Li Shang (Mulan character)|Li Shang]] came to recruit them for another mission. Shang claimed to the emperor that just the five of them would be enough protection for his three daughters. Although still as bumbling as ever, Shang knew that they were instrumental in their victory against the Huns, which they did not appear to have received the same credit for. They gladly joined the escort to get the emperor's daughters to the Qui Gong princes they are engaged to. Along the way, they develop feelings for the princesses, Yao with Mei, Ling with Ting-Ting, and Chien-Po with Su. They take the princesses to a carnival for some amusement. Eventually, all three princesses admit that their feeling is mutual, and do not want to marry the princes, despite their duty. Mulan, knowing this, leaves the trio with the princesses, and goes to offer herself to the royal family instead. However, the trio arrives with the princesses, as does Shang. [[Mushu]] pretends to be the Great Golden Dragon of Unity who commands that they are allowed to marry whoever they want, allowing them to be with Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po. Presumably, they did marry, though nothing was shown to indicate this.\n\n====Yao====\n'''Yao''' is the self-appointed leader of the trio. His signature color is [[red]] in the first film and [[purple]] in the second film. An arrogant and short-tempered individual with a bit of a [[Napoleon complex]], he is short, stocky and has a permanent black eye. In the first film, he enjoys picking on Mulan for fun at first but eventually becomes her friend. His clumsiness reveals, however, that he is not as powerful a man as he claims to be. He states about wanting a girl who'd admire his strength and battle scars.\n\nIn the second film, he reveals a rewarding [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] that has a picture of himself on his chest and falls in love with Princess Mei, the emperor's middle daughter. She accepted the idea that \"my duty is to my heart\" and is the easiest to be won over. In his encounter, he puts the slipper back onto her foot and sets the table for her with [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[baozi|meat bun]]s and [[tea]]. He wanted to marry a girl who would be impressed with his looks and his fighting ability. Although such traits leave something to be desired, he managed to impress her, and when he wins a fight at a carnival and is given a prize, he chooses a stuffed [[giant panda|panda bear]] with three black legs and one white leg and gives it to her.\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Chen Tang (actor)|Chen Tang]].\n\n====Ling====\n'''Ling''' is the group's middleman of medium height and very slim build. His signature color is [[yellow]] in the first film and [[blue]] in the second film. He is a friendly and enthusiastic man with a joke for every occasion. Though he teases Mulan at first, he, like the other two, becomes her friend. He and Yao occasionally have disagreements, but he grows to accept him as their leader. He was the one who coined the phrase \"a girl worth fighting for.\"\n\nIn the second film, he falls in love with Princess Ting-Ting, the eldest princess. She is the most uptight princess, devoted to honor, and tries be a role model to her sisters. Ling, who wanted a girl who would laugh at his jokes (even knowing the chopstick nose trick that Ling believes to have invented), had to try harder than his partners to impress her. Unlike most people, Ting-Ting is amused by his puns, but would not laugh, claiming to dislike laughter, though the reason is that she thinks her snorting laugh is embarrassing. He begins to doubt himself. However, at the carnival, when some fireflies accidentally set off firecrackers that hit Ling, she cannot contain herself at his misfortune. She snorts, but Ling doesn't mind and thinks it's cute. At the end, they are able to get married because of Mushu.\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Jimmy Wong]].\n\n====Chien-Po====\n'''Chien-Po''', or '''Po''' for short, is by far the tallest and most obese of Mulan's friends with a bald head. His signature color is [[blue]] in the first film and [[green]] in the second film. He is the calmest and most spiritual of the three, and his appearance seems to have been inspired by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] imagery. He is rather na\u00efve compared to his partners, and loves food more than anything, which is the main thing he considers when searching for a woman for he wishes for a wife that will be good at cooking and preparing food. He is very good-natured and would never do anything to upset anyone, making him the most ready to befriend Mulan. He also possesses great strength and can lift multiple people (or a massive stone statue) with ease.\n\nIn the second film, he falls in love with Princess Su, the youngest sister. The most childlike, she is easily swayed and is soon convinced of Mei's opinions. She loves food as much as Chien-Po, and when the group stops traveling for a while, she spends her time picking fruit from trees. Chien-Po discovers this, and the two of them bond easily. He even saves her when the carriage ends up falling in the water. At the carnival, they both order some [[dumpling]]s, [[ginger]], [[Ginseng]]s and [[soybean]]s.\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Doua Moua]].\n\n==Characters from ''Mulan''==\n\n===The Fa family===\n====Fa Zhou====\n'''Fa Zhou''' is Mulan's father who is very strict and also a famed war veteran who got injured in war. At first glance he seems like he only cares about the honor of the family and that he is quick to frustration with Mulan. He first appears putting an incense stick on the hanging dish and praying to the honorable ancestors while Mulan is seeing the matchmaker. Nothing distracts him from his prayers, even when [[chicken]]s go running around in the shrine to crazily devour the [[chicken feed]]. When Chi-Fu calls him from the Fa family for military duty, he puts down the cane, stands straight and accepts his assignment scroll, not caring about his old crippled body despite his limping and visible pain. Mulan worries that he is risking his life, especially after seeing him collapse after some sword exercises. When Mulan returns in a triumph of defeating Shan Yu, she gives him Shan Yu's sword with the blade wrapped in cloth and the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the emperor; the two gifts that honor the Fa Family. On receiving these gifts, he immediately puts them down and confesses that all he ever wanted was Mulan to be happy and safe, informing her that his greatest honor is having her as a daughter. He was voiced by [[Soon-Tek Oh]].\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Tzi Ma]].<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />\n====Fa Li====\n'''Fa Li''' is Mulan's mother. She initially stays with the dresser waiting for Mulan to come. She is frustrated when her daughter's hair is messed with [[hay]] and sends her inside to have her bathed and cleaned up. She and all the dressers help her get dressed after the bath. After they have finished beautifying Mulan, she sends her to the impatient matchmaker who then gets enraged by Mulan's accidents. Fa Li consoles her after the matchmaker rejects her. During the rainy night, she weeps for her daughter who runs away with Khan the horse, and her husband Fa Zhou consoles her while watching over her at the same time. When Li Shang shows up in the middle of a conversation between Fa Li and Grandmother Fa about Mulan's war exploits and that she should've brought a man home, Fa Li is left stunned. According to her second film, the only other child she likes is Sha-Ron (a faux-Chinese version of the name [[Sharon (disambiguation)|Sharon]]), a little girl who wears a lavender outfit and [[bun (hairstyle)#Double bun|ox-horns]]. She was voiced by [[Freda Foh Shen]].\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action film]], she is portrayed by [[Rosalind Chao]].<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />\n\n====Grandmother Fa====\n'''Grandmother Fa''' is Mulan's grandmother. She is very easy-going and gives Mulan the most freedom. She also provides comic relief in the family. She is first seen holding a cage with Cri-Kee in it. She covers her eyes while crossing a road and demonstrates the ability to show how lucky this cricket is. After Fa Li and all the dressers have finished beautifying Mulan, Grandma Fa gives her a few items to make her look perfect (apple, pendant, jade necklace and Cri-Kee). She constantly encourages her to find a good husband. During the rainy night, she recognizes that her granddaughter has run away to join the army in her father's place, and she picks up a [[lantern]] and prays to the ancestors, awakening First Ancestor Fa. When Mulan returns home with Shan Yu's sword and the Emperor's crest, she comments that Mulan should have brought a man home and is shocked when Li Shang arrives, causing her to jokingly say to sign her up for the next war.  When Mulan asks Shang to stay for dinner, she asks him to stay forever. Mulan is shown to be fondly annoyed by this but Shang does agree to stay for dinner. In her second film, she plays a game in the house of Fa and brings in food for the perfect couple Mulan and Shang. Her speaking voice is provided by [[June Foray]] and her singing voice is provided by [[Marni Nixon]].\n\n====First Ancestor Fa====\n'''First Ancestor Fa''' is the ghostly eldest member of the Fa family and acts as leader of the ancestors. He carries a staff with him. When he is summoned, he brings Mushu to life by saying the word \"awaken\". He usually stops the other ancestors from fighting and requests (what he thinks are) better plans such as summoning the Great Stone Dragon. When Mushu returns with Mulan, he gives him his job as a guardian again, though showing a frustrated face. At the beginning of his second film, he performs something interesting with the forming of smoke. He was voiced by [[George Takei]].\n\n=====Other Ancestors=====\n'''Other Ancestors''', members of the company including the farmer and his wife (a parody of the famous painting [[American Gothic]]), and the counter who is always fiddling with his [[abacus]]. Fa Deng is the only ancestor whose head is cut off, a result of Mushu's misguidance to him when he was a guardian. Many of these ancestors clamor about Mulan when she's away. [[Mary Kay Bergman]] did the voice of the female ancestors in the first film and in the second film, they are voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].\n\n===Khan===\n'''Khan''' is Mulan's [[horse]] with a [[black]] coat and [[white]] markings on his face, belly and legs. He is portrayed as a very intelligent and confident horse. When he first saw Mushu, he tried to kill him with his hooves out of fear. In the first film, during the surprise ambush on the mountains, Mulan causes an [[avalanche]] killing many Huns. Khan risks his life to save Mulan and tries his best to run to safety before he almost falls to his death off the cliff. He also seems to be very close to Mulan but doesn't like Mushu so much. In the second film, he gets angry at Mushu who tries to break Mulan and Shang up after his [[saddle]] is unbuckled and in one of his attempts, he injures him by stomping on him with his [[Horse hoof|hooves]] as payback. Khan is voiced by [[Frank Welker]].\n\nHe will appear in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]].\n\n===Little Brother===\n'''Little Brother''' is Mulan's pet dog. He has a blue [[Dog collar|collar]] around his neck. Mulan often uses him to spread chicken feeds by hanging a bone in front of him, similar to the [[carrot on a stick]] trick. He is voiced by [[Chris Sanders]] in the first movie and [[Frank Welker]] in the second movie.\n\n===The Emperor of China===\nBased on the real-life emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]], this character is shown as the wisest of all China. He lives in a palace (modeled, perhaps anachronistically, upon the [[Forbidden City]]) and he has a long mustache and beard. [[Yellow]] is the color that he wears. In his first film, when everybody's ambushed, he gets captured by Shan Yu and his henchmen resulting his hat to fall off, but then with Mulan and Shang, in order to save him, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (disguised as concubines) trick Shan Yu's henchmen into being attracted to them and so dropping their guard. After Shan Yu is terminated, the emperor comes down the steps and, though he sternly reprimands Mulan for impersonating a soldier, he then thanks her for saving their beloved country. He is the first person to bow to her, and even offers her a position on his council, but Mulan politely declines the offer by saying that she feels she should return to her family. In gratitude, he takes off his crest and puts it on her neck and gives Shan Yu's sword to her as tokens for her efforts, the crest representing what she did for him while the sword represents what she did for China. After she leaves, he puts his hat back on and tells Li Shang to go after her, noting that \"You don't meet a girl like that every [[dynasty|dynas-day]]\". His role is a little smaller in the second film, where he suggests Mulan and Shang to take his daughters to Qui-Gong as part of the mission.\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he is portrayed by [[Jet Li]].\n\n===Chi-Fu===\n'''Chi-Fu''' is a member of the Emperor's council and adviser to Li Shang who refuses to allow the recruits to join the battle against the Huns and serves as a minor antagonist of the film. He is shown to harbor substantial prejudice towards women. He is most often clad in [[Blue]] and places considerable importance on his clothing. He is shown to be devoted to his job and loyal to the Emperor, but is incompetent, [[egotism|egotistic]], pompous and [[misogyny|misogynistic]], as he silences Mulan and tells Fa Zhou to teach her silence in a man's presence, orders Li Shang to execute her once her secret is revealed, despite her saving everyone, and close to the film's conclusion pompously scoffs to Shang that Mulan would never be worth anything because she's a woman. At the end of the film, as the Emperor praises Mulan for defeating Shan-Yu and saving China, he tells Chi-Fu to arrange Mulan for membership in his council. Still believing that Mulan isn't worth anything because she is a woman, Chi-Fu attempts to dissuade him from doing so by claiming that there are no more available seats in the council, but this backfires when the Emperor tells Mulan she can have Chi-Fu's job, causing him to faint. He does not appear in ''Mulan II'', but it is shown that someone strikingly similar to Chi-Fu is a royal adviser to Lord Qin of [[Qigong]]. He was voiced by [[James Hong]].\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]], he will be replaced by '''The Chancellor''' (portrayed by [[Nelson Lee]]).\n\n===General Li===\n'''General Li''' was Li Shang's father and a high-ranking member of the Chinese army who was killed along with his elite troops in a battle against the Hun army, leaving his helmet behind to be found by his son and his battalion when they discover the aftermath. He was voiced by [[James Shigeta]].\n\n===The Matchmaker===\nThis character is an impatient and harsh woman, who obnoxiously judges potential brides. After the musical number called \"Honor To Us All,\" she opens the doors, calls Mulan's name and takes her inside. She distastefully judges Mulan, calling her too skinny, and asks her to pour the tea as the second part of the test. Cri-Kee, who attempts to escape, ends up in the Matchmaker's cup of tea, and when Mulan tries to take the cup back, The Matchmaker falls on the floor where Cri-Kee gets into the clothing and when she gets up to tell Mulan what happened, she notices that Cri-Kee is in her clothing, causing her to crash into a stove, lighting her backside on burning embers; Mulan tries to extinguish with a paper fan, but the hot embers turn into fire, which Mulan manages to extinguish by pouring the tea on her. Blaming Mulan for the troubles, she publicly humiliates her and says that she will never bring any honor to her family being a wife. She also called Mulan a disgrace when the Matchmaker was the real disgrace. Grandmother Fa noticed her as a little stinker. The second film reveals that she's \"smug and snooty,\" as accused by Ling, which causes her to throw a [[Pottery|pot]] onto his head as she flings out the masculine trio. She is voiced by [[Miriam Margolyes]] in the first film and [[April Winchell]] in the second film.\n\nShe will appear in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action remake]] and be portrayed by [[Cheng Pei-pei]].\n\n===Hayabusa===\nHayabusa is Shan Yu's pet [[saker falcon]], who acts as his master's eyes and ears from the distance. At the end of the first film, his feathers are burned down by a fireball from Mushu to stop him from warning the Huns of Li Shang's presence, who then taunts him as \"[[Mongolian barbecue|Mongolian barbeque]]\" while Cri-kee laughs at him. He isn't seen afterward.\n\nIn ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Hayabusa appears in the boss battle against Shan Yu. He can grab Sora, lift him into the air, and throw him.\n\nIn the [[Mulan (2020 film)|upcoming 2020 live-action film]], Hayabusa has been replaced by '''Xian Lang''' (portrayed by [[Gong Li]]), a powerful witch allied with Bori Khan who can transform herself into a falcon. She will be the main antagonist of the film.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\" />\n\n==Characters from ''Mulan II''==\n\n===Daughters of the Emperor of China===\nThe Emperor of China's three children that are known anyway; Ting-Ting, Mei and Su are princesses. He sends them into the [[carriage]] to complete the mission which is to marry the Princes of Qui Gong hiding their pretty faces with [[Fan (implement)|paper fan]]s. When in the carriage, these princesses begin to panic as Mushu causes it to slide down by banging his head on the wheel.\n\n*'''Ting-Ting''' is the eldest daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is [[indigo]] and she is taller than both of her sisters. After Mushu has caused the carriage to slide down, she forces her younger sisters out and tries to escape, but her foot is stuck only to be saved by Ling and the carriage breaks afterward. When she hears his jokes, she thinks they are funny but she tries not to laugh, as she has an embarrassing snorting laugh. However, when the [[firecracker]]s lit by the [[firefly|fireflies]] hit him, she laughs, which causes her to snort like a pig, which Ling thought was cute. Ting-Ting appears as mature and level-headed but is actually carefree in her heart. Her speaking voice is provided by Canadian award-winning actress [[Sandra Oh]] and her singing voice is provided by [[Judy Kuhn]]. She is Crown Princess of China and one day to be ''Her Majesty'' The Empress of China.\n\n*'''Mei''' is the middle daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is [[pink]] and she is in between her sisters in height. She likes to get along with Yao because she thinks he is good-looking and gentle at heart. She is convinced by Mulan that her duty is to her heart and she knows that it is true. Frustrated by her older sister, she drops her fan to get in the tent and writes, \"And so, my dear father, I cannot complete this mission. I have come to realize that my duty is to my heart.\" When Yao has won a wrestling fight, he chooses the stuffed [[Giant panda|panda bear]] and he shares it with her. Considered a slight [[Damsel in distress|damsel-in-distress]], she has been kidnapped by the enemies of China when the heroes have been knocked down during their fight but saved by her friends. Mei is passionate, brave and caring. Her speaking voice is provided by [[Lucy Liu]] and her singing voice is provided by Beth Blankenship.\n\n*'''Su''' is the youngest daughter of the Emperor of China. Her color is [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and she is shorter than both of her sisters. Her favorite thing to do is gathering food from the trees and she likes to spend time with Chien-Po who likes food also. When the carriage is damaged and the [[fruit]] floats in the water, she picks them up again and she gets saved by him too. She is bright, childish and cheerful. Her speaking voice is provided by [[Lauren Tom]] and her singing voice is provided by [[Mandy Gonzalez]].\n\n===Sha-Ron===\n'''Sha-Ron''' is a very excited little girl. She first visits Fa Li and says that she wants to see Mulan, who's practicing kung-fu with a rake. Then as she goes outside and drops the [[bucket]]s down, she and all of the other excited daughters of the villagers meet her and get trained on how to fight enemies as so during the \"Lesson Number One\" musical number. Then as General Shang arrives, she takes his helmet with more excitement and runs home. She is voiced by Jillian Henry.\n\n===Lord Qin and Prince Jeeki===\n'''Lord Qin''' is the priest of [[Qigong]]. When Mulan is about to complete the mission, he allows her to marry his son '''Prince Jeeki''' who likes playing with the [[Chinese finger trap]]. As Lord Qin engages Mulan and his son, their wedding is interrupted and he makes Shang go away until the Golden Dragon of Unity begins to talk with Mushu's voice. He timidly allows Mulan and Shang to marry each other and then begins to play with the fingertip Jeeki used to play with. Lord Qin is voiced by  [[Keone Young]] and Prince Jeeki is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]].\n\n==Characters from ''Mulan'' (2020 film)==\n===Commander Tung===\n'''Commander Tung''' (portrayed by [[Donnie Yen]]), a mentor and teacher to Mulan who leads the Imperial Regiment. The character is actually also partially based on Li Shang.<ref name=\"MulanOnSet\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/mulan-changes-live-action-animated-version-disney/|title=\u2018Mulan\u2019: The Biggest Changes from the Animated Version in Disney\u2019s Live-Action Remake|website=Collider|last=Szany|first=Wendy Lee|date=February 27, 2020|accessdate=February 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Hua Xiu===\n'''Hua Xiu''' (portrayed by Xana Tang), is the sister of [[Mulan (Disney character)|Hua Mulan]] and the second daughter of Hua Zhou and Hua Li.

Such internment was made legal by the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]], passed 3 September 1939. Section 21 of which read:\n\n:The Minister of Justice, if satisfied that, with a view to preventing any particular person from acting in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or the safety of the State, it is necessary to do so, may, notwithstanding anything in these regulations, make an order [...] directing that he be detained by virtue of an order made under this paragraph, be deemed to be in legal custody.\n\n===Internment of Jewish refugees===\nEuropean refugees who had managed to escape the Nazis and made it to Britain, were rounded up as \"enemy aliens\" in 1940.

The internees were given a chance by authorities to defend themselves; according to the transcripts of the appeal tribunals, internees and state officials debated conflicting concepts of citizenship.\n\nMany German Canadians interned in [[Camp Petawawa]] were from a migration in 1876. They had arrived in a small area a year after a Polish migration landed in [[Wilno]], Ontario. Their hamlet, made up of farmers primarily, was called Germanicus, and is in the bush less than {{Convert|10|mi|km|abbr=}} from [[Eganville]], [[Ontario]]. Their farms (homesteads originally) were expropriated by the federal government for no compensation, and the men were imprisoned behind barbed wire in the [[AOAT]] camp. (The [[Foymount]] Air Force Base near [[Cormac]] and Eganville was built on this expropriated land.) Notable was that not one of these homesteaders from 1876 or their descendants had ever visited Germany again after 1876, yet they were accused of being German [[Nazi]] agents.\n\n756 German sailors, mostly captured in [[East Asia]] were sent from camps in India to Canada in June 1941 (''Camp 33).<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\nBy 19 April 1941, 61 prisoners had made a break for liberty from Canadian internment camps.

After that, [[Italian Canadians]] were heavily scrutinized. Openly fascist organizations were deemed illegal while individuals with fascist inclinations were arrested most often without warrants. Organizations seen as openly fascist also had properties confiscated without warrants as well. A provision in the Canadian War Measures Act was immediately enacted by Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie|King]]. Named the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]], it allowed government authorities to take the needed measures to protect the country from internal threats and enemies. The same afternoon which Italy joined the axis powers, Italian consular and embassy officials were asked to leave as soon as physically possible. Canada, which was heavily involved in the war effort on the allies' side, saw the Italian communities as a breeding ground of likely internal threats and a haven of conceivable spy networks helping the fascist axis nations of Italy and Germany. Though many Italians were anti-fascist and no longer politically involved with their homeland, this did not stop 600-700 Italians from being sent to internment camps throughout Canada.<ref name=\"Massa, Evelyn Weinfield Pg 17-19\">Massa, Evelyn Weinfield, Morton: WE NEEDED TO PROVE WE WERE GOOD CANADIANS: CONTRASTING PARADIGMS FOR SUSPECT MINORITIES, pp. 17\u201319 Canadian Issues Spring 2009.</ref><ref>Carbone, Stanisla\u00f2: The Street Were Not Paved with Gold: A Social History of Italians in Winnipeg, pp. 70\u201373 Manitoba History, Number 29, Spring 1995.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italiancanadianww2.ca|title=Italian Canadians as Enemy Aliens: Memories of World War II|website=www.italiancanadianww2.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pier21.ca/culture-trunks/italy/history|title=History - Pier 21|website=www.pier21.ca}}</ref>\n\nThe first of these Italian prisoners were sent to Camp Petawawa situated in the Ottawa River Valley. By October 1940 the round up had already been completed. Italian Canadian Montrealer, Mario Duliani wrote, \"The City Without Women\" about his life in the internment camp Petawawa during World War II which describes a personal account of the struggles of the time. Throughout the country Italians were investigated by [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] officials who had a compiled list of Italian persons who were politically involved and deeply connected in the Italian communities. Most of the arrested individuals were from the Montreal and Toronto areas and pronounced [[enemy aliens]].<ref name=\"Massa, Evelyn Weinfield Pg 17-19\"/><ref name=\"[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]] Pg 21-22\">[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]]: Such Hardworking People, pp. 21\u201323 McGill-Queen's University Press.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, resentment and suspicion still lingered upon the Italian communities. Laval Fortier, commissioner for overseas immigration after the war wrote \"The Italian South Peasant is not the type we are looking for in Canada. His standard of living, his way of life, even his civilization seem so different that I doubt if he could ever become an asset to our country\".<ref>[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]]: Such Hardworking People, p. 22 McGill-Queen's University Press.</ref> Such remarks embedded a large proportion of the country that had negative views upon the Italian communities. A gallop poll released in 1946 showed 73 percent of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois were against immigration with 25 percent stating Italians were the group of people most wanted kept out. Such a stance upon the Italian people was evident even though years prior to the war had proven Italians were an asset to the Canadian economy and industry, for they accomplished critical jobs that were seen as very unappealing such as laying track across rural and dangerous landscapes and the construction of infrastructure in urban areas.<ref name=\"Massa, Evelyn Weinfield Pg 17-19\"/><ref name=\"[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]] Pg 21-22\"/>\n\n===Japanese Canadian internment and relocation centres===\n{{Main|Internment of Japanese Canadians}}\nDuring World War II, Canada interned residents of Japanese ancestry. Over 75% were Canadian nationals and they were vital in key areas of the economy, notably the fishery and also logging and berry farming. Exile took two forms: relocation centres for families and relatively well-off individuals who were a low security threat, and internment camps (often called concentration camps in contemporary accounts, but controversially so) which were for single men, the less well-off, and those deemed to be a security risk. After the war, many did not return to the Coast because of bitter feelings as to their treatment, and fears of further hostility from non-Japanese citizens; of those that returned only about 25% regained confiscated property and businesses. Most remained in other parts of Canada, notably certain parts of the [[British Columbia]] Interior and in the neighbouring province of Alberta.\n\n====Camps and relocation centres in the West Kootenay and Boundary regions====\nInternment camps, called \"relocation centres\", were at [[Greenwood, British Columbia|Greenwood]], [[Kaslo, British Columbia|Kaslo]], [[Lemon Creek, British Columbia|Lemon Creek]], [[New Denver, British Columbia|New Denver]], [[Rosebery, British Columbia|Rosebery]], [[Sandon, British Columbia|Sandon]], [[Slocan City, British Columbia|Slocan City]], and [[Tashme, British Columbia|Tashme]]. Some were nearly-empty [[ghost towns]] when the internment began, others, like Kaslo and Greenwood, while less populous than in their boom years, were substantial communities.\n\n====Self-supporting centres in the Lillooet-Fraser Canyon region====\nA different kind of camp, known as a self-supporting centre, was found in other regions. [[Shalalth|Bridge River]], [[Minto City]], [[McGillivray, British Columbia|McGillivray Falls]], [[Lillooet, British Columbia|East Lillooet]], Taylor Lake were in the [[Lillooet Country]] or nearby<!--Taylor Lake I'm not sure where it was, up by Green Lake/70 Mile maybe-->. Other than Taylor Lake, these were all called \"Self-supporting centres\", not internment camps. The first three listed were all in a mountainous area so physically isolated that fences and guards were not required as the only egress from that region was by rail or water. McGillivray Falls and [[Tashme]], on the [[Crowsnest Highway]] east of [[Hope, British Columbia]], were just over the minimum 100 miles from the Coast required by the deportation order, though Tashme had direct road access over that distance, unlike McGillivray. Because of the isolation of the country immediately coast-wards from McGillivray, men from that camp were hired to work at a sawmill in what has since been named [[Devine, British Columbia|Devine]], after the mill's owner, which is within the 100-mile quarantine zone. Many of those in the East Lillooet camp were hired to work in town, or on farms nearby, particularly at [[Fountain, British Columbia|Fountain]], while those at Minto and Minto Mine and those at Bridge River worked for the railway or the hydro company.<ref>[''My Sixty Years in Canada'', Masajiro Miyazaki, self publ.]</ref><ref>''Short Portage to Lillooet'', Irene Edwards, self-publ.

Split]]\n\n==Cuba==\n{{Main|Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rub\u00ed}}\nAfter [[Arsenio Mart\u00ednez Campos|Marshal Campos]] had failed to pacify the [[Spanish\u2013American War#Cuban struggle for independence|Cuban rebellion]], the Conservative government of [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo]] sent out [[Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rub\u00ed|Valeriano Weyler]]. This selection met the approval of most Spaniards, who thought him the proper man to crush the rebellion. While serving as a Spanish general, he was called \"Butcher Weyler\" because hundreds of thousands of people died in his [[concentration camp]]s.\n\nHe was made [[governor]] of Cuba with full powers to suppress the insurgency (rebellion was widespread in Cuba) and restore the island to political order and its sugar production to greater profitability. Initially, Weyler was greatly frustrated by the same factors that had made victory difficult for all generals of traditional standing armies fighting against an insurgency. While the Spanish troops marched in regulation and required substantial supplies, their opponents practiced hit-and-run tactics and lived off the land, blending in with the non-combatant population. He came to the same conclusions as his predecessors as well\u2014that to win Cuba back for Spain, he would have to separate the rebels from the civilians by putting the latter in safe havens, protected by loyal Spanish troops. By the end of 1897, General Weyler had relocated more than 300,000 into such \"reconcentration camps.\" Weyler learned this tactic from the [[American Civil War]] campaign of [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]] while assigned to the post of military attach\u00e9 in the Spanish Embassy in Washington D.C.. However, many mistakenly believe him to be to the origin of such tactics after it was later used by the British in the [[Second Boer War]] and later evolved into a designation to describe the [[concentration camps]] of the 20th century regimes of Hitler and Stalin. Although he was successful moving vast numbers of people, he failed to provide for them adequately. Consequently, these areas became cesspools of hunger and disease, where many hundreds of thousands died.\n\nWeyler's \"reconcentration\" policy had another important effect. Although it made Weyler's military objectives easier to accomplish, it had devastating political consequences. Although the Spanish Conservative government supported Weyler's tactics wholeheartedly, the Liberals denounced them vigorously for their toll on the Cuban civilian population. In the propaganda war waged in the United States, Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s made much of Weyler's inhumanity to their countrymen and won the sympathy of broad groups of the U.S. population to their cause. He was nicknamed \"the Butcher\" Weyler by journalists like [[William Randolph Hearst]].\n\nWeyler's strategy also backfired militarily due to the rebellion in the [[Philippines]] that required the redeployment by 1897 of some troops already in Cuba. When Prime Minister [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo]] was assassinated in June, Weyler lost his principal supporter in Spain. He resigned his post in late 1897 and returned to Europe. He was replaced in Cuba by the more conciliatory [[Ram\u00f3n Blanco y Erenas]].\n\n{{Main|Military Units to Aid Production}}\n{{See also|Human rights in Cuba}}\n[[Military Units to Aid Production]] were [[forced labor]] [[concentration camp]]s established by [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Communism|communist]] government, from November 1965 to July 1968.\n\nThey were a way to eliminate alleged \"[[bourgeois]]\" and \"[[counter-revolutionary]]\" values in the Cuban population. First, people were thrown into overcrowded cells at police stations and later taken to secret police facilities, cinemas, stadia, warehouses, and similar locations.

Once the White terror subsided, a few thousand including mainly small children and women, were set free, leaving 74,000\u201376,000 prisoners. The largest [[List of concentration and internment camps#Finland|prison camps]] were [[Suomenlinna]], an island facing Helsinki, [[H\u00e4meenlinna]], [[Lahti]], [[Vyborg|Viipuri]], [[Eken\u00e4s, Finland|Eken\u00e4s]], [[Riihim\u00e4ki]] and [[Tampere]]. The Senate made the decision to keep these prisoners detained until each person's guilt could be examined. A law for a ''Tribunal of Treason'' was enacted on 29 May after a long dispute between the White army and the Senate of the proper trial method to adopt. The start of the heavy and slow process of trials was delayed further until 18 June 1918. The Tribunal did not meet all the standards of neutral justice, due to the mental atmosphere of White Finland after the war. Approximately 70,000 Reds were convicted, mainly for complicity to treason. Most of the sentences were lenient, however, and many got out on parole. 555 persons were sentenced to death, of whom 113 were executed. The trials revealed also that some innocent persons had been imprisoned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1971}}, {{Harvnb|Kekkonen|1991}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen|1992|pp=140, 142}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentil\u00e4|Nevakivi|1999|p=112}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=161\u201378}}, Uta.fi/Suomi80/Yhteiskunta/Valtiorikosoikeudet</ref>\n\nCombined with the severe food shortage, the mass imprisonment led to high mortality rates in the camps, and the catastrophe was compounded by a mentality of punishment, anger and indifference on the part of the victors. Many prisoners felt that they were abandoned also by their own leaders, who had fled to Russia. The condition of the prisoners had weakened rapidly during May, after food supplies had been disrupted during the Red Guards' retreat in April, and a high number of prisoners had been captured already during the first half of April in Tampere and Helsinki. As a consequence, 2,900 starved to death or died in June as a result of diseases caused by malnutrition and [[Spanish flu]], 5,000 in July, 2,200 in August, and 1,000 in September. The mortality rate was highest in the [[Eken\u00e4s, Finland|Eken\u00e4s]] camp at 34%, while in the others the rate varied between 5% and 20%. In total, between 11,000 and 13,500 Finns perished.

The 17,000 refugees housed in Gurs were divided into four categories ([[Brigadist]]s, pilots, ''[[Euzko Gudarostea|Gudari]]s'' and ordinary Spaniards). The ''Gudaris'' (Basques) and the pilots easily found local backers and jobs, and were allowed to quit the camp, but the farmers and ordinary people, who could not find relations in France, were encouraged by the Third Republic, in agreement with the Francoist government, to return to Spain. The great majority did so and were turned over to the Francoist authorities in [[Ir\u00fan]]. From there they were transferred to the [[Miranda de Ebro]] camp for \"purification\".\n\nAfter the proclamation by Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] of the [[Vichy regime]], the refugees became political prisoners, and the [[French police]] attempted to round-up those who had been liberated from the camp. Along with other \"undesirables\", they were sent to the [[Drancy internment camp]] before being deported to [[Nazi Germany]]. About 5,000 Spaniards thus died in [[Mauthausen concentration camp]]<ref name=Cite>[http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/index.php?lg=fr&nav=20&flash=0 Film documentary] on the website of the ''[[Cit\u00e9 nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration]]'' {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n===Vichy France===\nDuring [[World War II]], The French [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government ran what were called \"detention camps\" such as the one at [[Drancy deportation camp|Drancy]]. Camps also existed in the [[Pyrenees]] on the border with pro-Nazi Spain, among them [[Camp de Rivesaltes]], [[Camp Gurs]] and [[Camp Vernet]]. From these, the French cooperated in deporting about 73,000 Jews to [[Nazi Germany]].\n\nIn addition, in areas which Germany formally annexed from France, such as [[Alsace-Lorraine]], concentration camps were built, the largest being [[Natzweiler-Struthof]].\n\nThe Vichy French also ran camps in North and West Africa, and possibly [[French Somaliland]] and [[Madagascar]]. The following are the locations of concentration camps, POW camps, and internment camps in (Vichy) West and (Vichy) North Africa:\n\nThe camps were located at:\n\nWest Africa:\n* [[Conakry]]\n* [[Timbuctoo]]\n* [[Kankan]]\n* [[Mali|Koulikorro, Mali]]\n* [[Dakar]]\n\nNorth Africa:\n* [[Sfax]]\n* [[El Kef]]\n* [[Laghouat prison camp|Laghouat]]\n* Geryville.\n\nAlso camps connected to the ''Laconia'' incident:\n* [[Mediouna, Morocco|Mediouna]] (near [[Casablanca]])\n* [[Morocco|Qued-Zen, Morocco]] (near Casablanca)\n* [[Morocco|Sidi-el-Avachi, Morocco]] (near Azemmour)\n\nThe following camps which are under investigation:\n* Taza\n* Fes\n* Oujda\n* Sidi-bel-Abbes\n* Berguent\n* Settat\n* Sidi-el-Ayachi\n* Qued Zem\n* Mecheria\n\nThe camps at [[Conakry]], [[Timbuktu|Timbuctoo]], and [[Kankan]] had no running water, no electricity, no gas, no electric light no sewers, no toilets, and no baths.

This camp became the model for all later [[Nazi concentration camps]]. It was quickly followed by [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen]] which became a facility for the training of [[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde|SS-Death's Head]] officers in the operation of concentration camps.\n\n[[Theodor Eicke]], commandant of the Dachau camp, was appointed Inspector of Concentration Camps by [[Heinrich Himmler]] on 4 July 1934. By 1934 there were eight major institutions. This started the second phase of development. All smaller detention camps were consolidated into six major camps: Dachau, Sachsenhausen, [[Buchenwald]], [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp|Flossenburg]], and after the [[Anschluss|annexation]] of Austria in 1938, [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]]; finally in 1939 [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]] (for women). The pajama type blue-striped uniforms were introduced for inmates as well as the practice of tattooing the prisoner's number on his fore-arm. Eicke started the practice of farming out prisoners as slave-labor in German industry, with sub-camps or ''[[Arbeitskommando]]s'' to house them. The use of common criminals as [[Kapo (concentration camp)|Kapo]], to brutalize and assist in the handling of prisoners, was instituted at this time. In November 1938 the massive arrests of German Jews started, with most of them being immediately sent to the concentration camps, where they were separated from other prisoners and subjected to even harsher treatment.\n\nThe third phase started after the occupation of Poland in 1939. In the first few months Polish intellectuals were detained, including nearly the entire staff of [[Cracow University]] arrested in November 1939.<ref>{{cite book | title= History of Poland | isbn= 0-88029-858-8 | first= Oscar | last= Halecki | page= [https://archive.org/details/historyofpoland0000hale/page/313 313] | date= June 1992 | url-access= registration | url= https://archive.org/details/historyofpoland0000hale/page/313 }}</ref> [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-I]] and [[Stutthof concentration camp]] were built to house them and other political prisoners. Large numbers were executed or died from the brutal treatment and disease. After the occupation of Belgium, France and Netherlands in 1940, [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], [[Gross Rosen]] and [[Fort Breendonk]], in addition to a number of smaller camps, were set up to house intellectuals and political prisoners from those countries who had not already been executed.<ref>''Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 957.</ref> Many of these intellectuals were held first in [[Gestapo]] prisons, and those who were not executed immediately after interrogation were sent on to the concentration camps.\n\nInitially, Jews in the occupied countries were interned either in other KZ, but predominantly in [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939-1944|Ghettos]] that were walled off parts of cities. All the Jews in western Poland (annexed into the Reich) were transported to ghettos in the [[General Government]]. Jews were used for labour in industries, but usually transported to work then returned to the KZ or the ghetto at night. Although these ghettoes were not intended to be extermination camps, and there was no official policy to kill people, thousands died due to hunger, disease and extreme conditions. During the German advance into Russia in 1941 and 1942 Jewish soldiers and civilians were systematically executed by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' of the S.S. that followed the front-line troops. At the [[Wannsee Conference]] on 20 January 1942 the \"[[Final Solution]]\" was decreed to exterminate all of the remaining Jews in Europe, [[Heydrich]] stated that there were still 11 million to be eliminated.<ref>\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\" pp. 959\u201365</ref> To accomplish this special ''Vernichtungslager'' ('''extermination camps''') were organized. The first was [[Che\u0142mno extermination camp|Che\u0142mno]] in which 152,000, mainly from the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] ghetto, were killed. The method for carrying out mass murder was tested and perfected here. During 1942 and 1943 further camps [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau II]], part of [[Majdanek]], [[Treblinka]], [[Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp|Be\u0142\u017cec]] and [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]] were built for this purpose. Jews from other concentration camps, and from the ghettos, were transported to them from all over occupied Europe. In these six camps alone, an estimated 3.1 million Jews were killed in gas chambers and the bodies burned in massive crematoria. The Nazis realized that this was a criminal act {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the action was shrouded in secrecy. The extermination camps were destroyed in 1944 and early 1945 and buried. However the Soviet armies overran Auschwitz and Majdanek before the evidence could be totally destroyed.\n[[File:Buchenwald-bei-Weimar-am-24-April-1945.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator [[Alben W. Barkley]] views the bodies of prisoners at a liberated [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] in April 1945]]\n\nAnother category of internment camp in Nazi Germany was the '''[[Labor camp]]''' (''[[Arbeitslager]]''). They housed civilians from the occupied countries that were being used to work in industry, on the farms, in quarries, in mines and on the railroads. Approximately 12,000,000 forced laborers, most of whom were [[Eastern Europe]]ans, were enslaved in the German war economy inside the [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1757323,00.html|title=Final Compensation Pending for Former Nazi Forced Laborers |date= 27 October 2005|website=DW.COM|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |title=Forced Labor at Ford Werke AG during the Second World War |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014235036/http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |archivedate=14 October 2007 }}</ref> The workers were mostly young and taken from the occupied countries, predominantly eastern Europe, but also many French and Italian. They were sometimes taken willingly, more frequently as a result of ''[[lapanka]]'' in Polish, or ''rafle'' in French language, in which people were collected on the street or in their home by police drives. However, for often very minor infractions of the rules, workers were imprisoned in special ''Arbeitserziehungslager'', [[German language|German]] for '''worker re-education camp''' (abbreviated to AEL and sometimes referred to as ''Straflager'').<ref>de:Arbeiterserziehungslager</ref> These punishment camps were operated by the [[Gestapo]] and many of the inmates were executed or died from the brutal treatment.\n\nFinally there was one category of internment camp, called [[Ilag]] in which Allied (mainly British and American) civilians were held. These civilians had been caught behind front lines by the rapid advance of the German armies, or the sudden entry of the United States into the war. In these camps the Germans abided by the rules of the [[Third Geneva Convention]]. Deaths resulted from sickness or simply old age.\n\nAfter World War II, internment camps were used by the Allied occupying forces to hold suspected Nazis, usually using the facilities of previous Nazi camps. They were all closed down by 1949. In [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] the communist government used prison camps to hold political prisoners, opponents of the communist regime or suspected Nazi collaborators.\n* [[Bad Nenndorf interrogation centre]]\n\n{{See also|Nazi concentration camp badges|List of concentration camps of Nazi Germany|List of concentration camps for Poles|Extermination of Soviet prisoners of war by Nazi Germany|Ilag}}\n\n==Hong Kong==\nDuring the Second World War the Japanese, during their occupation of Hong Kong, interned enemy nationals (mostly British, Canadian, American and Dutch), in several internment camps in Hong Kong. Camps existed at:\n\n* [[Sham Shui Po]] \u2013 A concentration camp was maintained here for most of the duration of the Second World War.\n* Stanley Internment Camp \u2013 Located primarily on the grounds of [[St. Stephen's College, Hong Kong|St. Stephen's College]]. Shortly after surrendering, the Imperial Japanese Army broke into the St. Stephen's (which had served as a military hospital during the battle) and murdered the wounded soldiers of the Allied forces. The Japanese later merged the College with part of Stanley Prison to form the full Stanley Internment Camp.\n* Stanley Prison \u2013 Located primarily in the Officer's housing blocks at the prison. During the Japanese occupation, the grounds of the prison were used as part of Stanley Internment Camp. Nearly 600 prisoners of war and civilians, killed by the Japanese during the occupation, are buried in the nearby Stanley War Cemetery (which is NOT part of the prison itself but adjacent to it).\n\n== India, British ==\nDuring both World Wars the British interned enemy nationals (mostly Germans). In 1939 this also included refugees from the Nazis as well as Germans who had acquired British citizenship, in India.

By March 1942 many civilians, particularly westerners in the region's European colonies, found themselves behind enemy lines and were subsequently interned by the Japanese.\n\nThe nature of civilian internment varied from region to region. Some civilians were interned soon after invasion; in other areas the process occurred over many months. In total, approximately 130,000 Allied civilians were interned by the Japanese during this period of occupation. The exact number of internees will never be known as records were often lost, destroyed, or simply not kept.\n[[File:73-Japanse kampen in Nederlands-Indi\u00eb.jpg|thumb|Liberated Dutch prisoners in Indonesia (Dutch East Indies) in 1945]]\nThe backgrounds of the internees were diverse. There was a large proportion of Dutch from the [[Dutch East Indies]], but they also included Americans, British, and Australians. They included missionaries and their families, colonial administrators, and business people. Many had been living in the colonies for decades. Single women had often been nuns, missionaries, doctors, teachers and nurses.\n\nCivilians interned by the Japanese were treated marginally better than the prisoners of war, but their death rates were the same. Although they had to work to run their own camps, few were made to labour on construction projects. The Japanese devised no consistent policies or guidelines to regulate the treatment of the civilians. Camp conditions and the treatment of internees varied from camp to camp. The general experience, however, was one of malnutrition, disease, and varying degrees of harsh discipline and brutality from the Japanese guards. Some [[Dutch people|Dutch]] women were forced into [[sexual slavery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html |title=Comfort Women Were 'Raped': U.S. Ambassador to Japan |accessdate=12 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324104443/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html |archivedate=24 March 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/abe-ignores-evidence-say-australias-comfort-women/2007/03/02/1172338881441.html|title=Abe ignores evidence, say Australia's 'comfort women' |website=www.theage.com.au|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe camps varied in size from four people held at Pangkalpinang in Sumatra to the 14,000 held in [[Tjihapit]] in Java. Some were segregated according to gender or race, there were also many camps of mixed gender. Some internees were held at the same camp for the duration of the war, and others were moved about. The buildings used to house internees were generally whatever was available, including schools, warehouses, universities, hospitals, and prisons.\n[[File:Jean-marie-and-private-tanner.jpg|thumb|left|Jean-Marie Faggiano receives a doll from [[Private First Class]] Theo Tanner of the U.S. First Cavalry. Tanner had just removed the doll from a dead Japanese soldier, killed during the liberation of the Santo Tomas Internment Camp in Manila, Philippines in February 1945]]\n\nOrganisation of the internment camps varied by location. The Japanese administered some camps directly; others were administered by local authorities under Japanese control. Korean POWs of the Japanese were also used as camp guards. Some of the camps were left for the internees to self-govern. In the mixed and male camps, management often fell to the men who were experienced in administration before their internment. In the women's camps the leaders tended to be the women who had held a profession prior to internment. Boys over the age of ten were generally considered to be men by the Japanese and were often separated from their mothers to live and work in male camps.\n\nOne of the most famous concentration camps operated by the Japanese during World War II was at the [[University of Santo Tomas]] in [[Manila]], the Philippines, the [[Santo Tomas Internment Camp]]. The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] university was expropriated by the Japanese at the beginning of the occupation, and was used to house mostly American civilians, but also British subjects, for the duration of the war. There, men, women and children suffered from malnutrition and poor sanitation. The camp was liberated in 1945.\n\nThe liberation of the camps was not a uniform process. Many camps were liberated as the forces were recapturing territory. For other internees, freedom occurred many months after the surrender of the Japanese, and in the Dutch East Indies, liberated internees faced the uncertainty of the [[Indonesian War of Independence]].\n\nCivilian internees were generally disregarded in official histories, and few received formal recognition. Ironically, however, civilian internees have become the subject of several influential books and films. [[Agnes Newton Keith]]'s account of internment on [[Berhala Island, Sabah|Berhala Island]] in [[Sandakan|Sandakan Harbour]] and [[Batu Lintang camp]], Kuching, ''[[Three Came Home]]'' (1947), was one of the first of the memoirs. More recent publications include Jeanne Tuttle and Jolanthe Zelling's \"Mammie's Journal of My Childhood\" (2005); (Shirley Fenton-Huie's ''The Forgotten Ones'' (1992) and Jan Ruff O'Herne's ''Fifty Years of Silence'' (1997). Nevil Shute's novel ''[[A Town Like Alice]]'' was filmed in 1956, and J. G. Ballard's ''[[Empire of the Sun]]'' in 1987. Other films and television dramas have included ''[[Tenko (TV series)|Tenko]]'' and ''[[Paradise Road (1997 film)|Paradise Road]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/Encyclopedia/pow/ww2/civilian_internees.htm |title=Prisoners of the Japanese: Civilian internees, Pacific and South-East Asia &#124; Australian War Memorial |publisher=Awm.gov.au |date= |accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://166.122.164.43/archive/2004/june/06-22-17.htm |title=Guam Survivor Recalls WWII Forced |date=22 June 2004 |publisher=166.122.164.43 |accessdate=8 November 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707160612/http://166.122.164.43/archive/2004/june/06-22-17.htm |archive-date=7 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.kuam.com/news/10206.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223804/http://www.kuam.com/news/10206.aspx|date=27 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Korea, Republic of==\nDuring the 1980s, [[South Korea]] had multiple internment camps, including the [[Brothers Home]], which housed thousands of prisoners in [[Busan]].<ref name=\"THK\">{{cite news|last1=Tong-Hyung|first1=Kim|last2=Klug|first2=Foster|title=AP: S.

From 1922 to 1928, Italian forces under General [[Pietro Badoglio]] waged a punitive pacification campaign. Badoglio's successor in the field, Marshal [[Rodolfo Graziani]] (known as 'The Butcher of Fezzan'), accepted the commission from Mussolini on the condition that he be allowed to crush the Libyan resistance unencumbered by the restraints of either Italian or international law. Reportedly, Mussolini immediately agreed and Graziani intensified the [[oppression]]. The Libyans continued to defend themselves, with the strongest voices of dissent coming from the Cyrenaica. [[Omar Mukhtar]], a [[Senussi]] sheikh, became the leader of the uprising.\n\nSoon afterwards, the colonial administration began the wholesale deportation of the people of Cyrenaica to deny the rebels the support of the local population. The forced migration of more than 100,000 people ended in concentration camps in Suluq- ALa byer and [[El Agheila|Al Agheila]] where tens of thousands died in squalid conditions. It is estimated (by Arab historians) that the number of Libyans who died \u2013 killed either through combat or mainly through starvation, execution and disease \u2013 is at a minimum of 80,000 or even up to one third of the Cyrenaican population.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&pg=PA309|title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing|last=Mann|first=Michael|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521538541|location=|page=309|language=}}</ref>\n\n==Montenegro==\n\nThe fort on the island of [[Mamula (island)|Mamula]] was converted into a [[concentration camp]] by the [[Italian fascism|fascist]] forces of [[Benito Mussolini|Benito Mussolini's]] [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nDuring the 1991 to 1995 [[Croatian War of Independence]], the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] organized the [[Morinj camp]] near [[Kotor]], [[Montenegro]].\n\n==Netherlands==\nDuring WWI, all foreign soldiers and ship crews that illegally entered the neutral Netherlands were interned in a specific camp based on their nationality (to avoid conflict). By far the largest camp was the one for British sailors and soldiers in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. Unlike the [[Prisoners of War|PoWs]] at the time in the neighbouring countries, Dutch prisoners had plenty of food, and tradesmen often came to the camp with a wide range of goods. The interned were paid a certain amount of compensation money by the Dutch authorities on top of any British aid that got channeled to them through the Dutch government. One prisoner later commented: \"... we were quite well off, and the local people were very good to us.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatwar.nl/index.html|title=British sailors in Groningen camp|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAfter a revolt in 1926 in the [[Dutch East Indies]], a concentration camp for political prisoners was set up in what then was called [[Netherlands New Guinea]], in the very remote jungle at [[Boven-Digoel]] (Upper-Digul).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dr L. de Jong, ''Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog'' ('' The Kingdom of the Netherlands during WWII''), Amsterdam, RIOD, 1966</ref>\n\nJust before World War II engulfed the Netherlands, a camp was built in 1939 at [[Westerbork (village)|Westerbork]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government for interning Jewish refugees who had fled [[Nazi Germany]]. During the German occupation [[Westerbork transit camp|this camp]] was used as a transit camp for Dutch Jews eventually deported to [[extermination camp]]s in the East. [[Amersfoort concentration camp|Amersfoort]] (1941\u20131945) (in German: ''Polizeiliches Durchgangslager'') was also a transit camp. The [[Herzogenbusch concentration camp|Herzogenbusch]] camp (1943\u20131944, known as ''[[Kamp Vught]]'' because of its location in that town) was a concentration camp, the only one in Western Europe outside Germany set up as well as run by the [[SS]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nOther camps were [[Kamp Schoorl|camp Schoorl]] near Schoorl and [[Kamp Erika|camp Erika]] near Ommen. Before the [[Shoah]] began, some two dozen labor camps for Jewish men were operated fulfilling an order of the German occupiers. In the Dutch East Indies, after the occupation of the Netherlands by the Germans in Europe started on 15 May 1940, Germans living in the Indies were rounded up and interned there. Almost all camps also had field offices for forced labor. In the case of Vught as well as Amersfoort work details for [[Philips]] factories existed, often under relatively favourable circumstances. Also, the huge construction activities for the 30 German airfields in the Netherlands relied partly upon labour from camps.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAfter the war, the Dutch government launched the [[Operation Black Tulip]] and started to gather civil population of German background to concentration camps near the German border, especially [[Nijmegen]], in order to deport them from the country. In total around 15% of the German population in the Netherlands was deported.\n\nNumerous improvised and official camps were set up after the war, to keep Dutch who were suspected of collaboration with the Germans. Kamp Westerbork at one point housed some Jews as well as suspected collaborators and Germans. In these camps, a history of maltreatment by the guards, sometimes leading to death, has been collected.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==New Zealand==\nIn World War I German civilians living in New Zealand were interned in camps on [[Motuihe Island|Motuihe]] and [[Somes Island|Somes]] Islands.

Those persons considered \"adversary class forces\", such as landholders, Japanese collaborators, religious devotees and the families of people who migrated to the [[South Korea|South]], were rounded up and detained in large facilities. Additional camps were later established in the late 1950s and 60s in order to incarcerate the political victims of power struggles along with their families as well as overseas Koreans who migrated to the North. Later, the number of camps saw a marked increase with the cementing of the [[Kim Il Sung]] dictatorship and the [[Kim Jong-il]] succession. About a dozen concentration camps were in operation until the early 1990s, but some of them were closed and merged into the remaining six camps for the purpose of maintaining better secrecy and control.<ref>{{cite web |title=White paper on human rights in North Korea 2009 (pp. 117\u201343)|publisher=Korea Institute for National Unification|url=http://www.kinu.or.kr/2009/0727/white2009_e.pdf |accessdate=9 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nNorth Korea is known to operate six concentration camps, currently accommodating around 200,000 prisoners.

(In the [[Russian language]], the term is used to denote the whole system, rather than individual camps.)\n\nIn addition to what is sometimes referred to as the GULAG proper (consisting of the \"corrective labor camps\") there were \"corrective labor colonies\", originally intended for prisoners with short sentences, and \"special resettlements\" of deported peasants.

Initially they were shipped overseas, but that was halted when a German [[U-boat]] sank the SS ''[[Arandora Star]]'' in July 1940 with the loss of 800 internees, though this was not the first loss that had occurred. The last internees were released late in 1945, though many were released in 1942. In Britain, internees were housed in camps and prisons. Some camps had tents rather than buildings with internees sleeping directly on the ground. Men and women were separated and most contact with the outside world was denied.

Known as [[New Village]]s, these camps were intended to become permanent settlements. As attacks by the [[Malayan Communist Party]] declined, the curfews were lifted, fences removed, and the camps gradually ceased to be internment camps. To this day many villages founded in this way are known as New Villages and remain ethnically Chinese.\n\n===Northern Ireland===\n{{Main|Operation Demetrius}}\nOne of the most famous example of modern ''internment'' (and one which made world headlines) occurred in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1971, when hundreds of [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] and [[Irish republicanism|Irish Republicans]] were arrested by the [[British Army]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] on the orders of then [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[Brian Faulkner]], with the backing of the [[British government]]. Historians generally view that period of internment as inflaming [[sectarian]] tensions in Northern Ireland while failing in its stated aim of arresting members of the paramilitary [[Provisional IRA]]. Many of the people arrested were completely unconnected with the Provisional IRA but, through bungling and incompetence, had their names appear on the list of those to be interned,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} while over 100 IRA men escaped arrest. The backlash against internment and its bungled application contributed to the decision of the British government under Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] to suspend the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Stormont governmental]] system in Northern Ireland and replace it with ''[[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|Direct rule]]'' from London, under the authority of a British [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]].\n\nFrom 1971 internment began, beginning with the arrest of 342 suspected republican guerrillas and paramilitary members on 9 August. They were held at [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|HM Prison]] [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze]] then called [[Long Kesh Detention Centre]]. By 1972, 924 men were interned. Serious rioting ensued, and 23 people died in three days. The [[British government]] attempted to show some balance by arresting some [[loyalist]] paramilitaries later, but out of the 1,981 men interned,<ref name=\"joint2005p110\" /> only 107 were loyalists. Internment was ended in 1975, but had resulted in increased support for the IRA and created political tensions which culminated in the [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike]] and the death of [[Bobby Sands]], member of British Parliament ([[Anti H-Block|Anti H-Block/Armagh Political Prisoner]] Party.)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/northern_ireland/understanding/events/hunger_strike.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Hunger Strike |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/election/rwby1981a.htm |title=CAIN: Politics: Elections: Westminster By-election (NI) Thursday 9 April 1981 |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=9 April 1981 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> His death resulted in a new surge of IRA recruitment and activity.

Internment had previously been used as a means of repressing the [[Irish Republican Army]]. It was used between 1939\u20131945 and 1956\u20131962.

Locations as identified by the historian Simon Webb include [[Rothesay, Bute|Rothesay]] on the [[Isle of Bute]], and [[Tighnabruaich]] on the Scottish mainland. Rothesay was used to house the political enemies of the leader of the Polish Government in Exile, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], as well as Poles considered by Sikorski's Government in Exile of being morally dubious. [[Tighnabruaich]] held criminals under the jurisdiction of the Polish Government in Exile. Webb claims the Poles were later allowed to open further camps at [[Kingledoors]], [[Auchterarder]] and [[Inverkeithing]] near [[Edinburgh]]. Although deaths, and claims of torture and privations were made by numerous British [[Members of Parliament]] against the internment camps, the camps treated as sovereign Polish territory and local Scottish police forces were unable to investigate what happened in them. Webb also suggests that being [[Jewish]] or a suspected [[Communist]] was often enough to lead to Polish citizens under the jurisdiction of the Polish Government in Exile being sent to one of the internment camps.<ref>Simon Webb, ''British Concentration Camps: A Brief History from 1900 - 1975'' (London: Pen & Sword Books, 2016), chapter 5</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\n[[File:LizzieVanZyl.jpg|thumb|[[Lizzie van Zyl]], shortly before her death in [[Bloemfontein]] Concentration Camp]]\nThe term '''concentration camp''' was first used by the British military during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] (1899\u20131902).

This included both [[fascist]]s (including Canadians such as [[Adrien Arcand]] who had negotiated with [[Hitler]] to obtain positions in the government of Canada once Canada was conquered), [[Montreal]] mayor [[Camillien Houde]] (for denouncing [[conscription]]) and [[trade union|union]] organizers and other people deemed to be dangerous [[Communist]]s. Such internment was made legal by the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]], passed 3 September 1939. Section 21 of which read:\n\n:The Minister of Justice, if satisfied that, with a view to preventing any particular person from acting in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or the safety of the State, it is necessary to do so, may, notwithstanding anything in these regulations, make an order [...] directing that he be detained by virtue of an order made under this paragraph, be deemed to be in legal custody.\n\n===Internment of Jewish refugees===\nEuropean refugees who had managed to escape the Nazis and made it to Britain, were rounded up as \"enemy aliens\" in 1940.

The internees were given a chance by authorities to defend themselves; according to the transcripts of the appeal tribunals, internees and state officials debated conflicting concepts of citizenship.\n\nMany German Canadians interned in [[Camp Petawawa]] were from a migration in 1876. They had arrived in a small area a year after a Polish migration landed in [[Wilno]], Ontario. Their hamlet, made up of farmers primarily, was called Germanicus, and is in the bush less than {{Convert|10|mi|km|abbr=}} from [[Eganville]], [[Ontario]]. Their farms (homesteads originally) were expropriated by the federal government for no compensation, and the men were imprisoned behind barbed wire in the [[AOAT]] camp. (The [[Foymount]] Air Force Base near [[Cormac]] and Eganville was built on this expropriated land.) Notable was that not one of these homesteaders from 1876 or their descendants had ever visited Germany again after 1876, yet they were accused of being German [[Nazi]] agents.\n\n756 German sailors, mostly captured in [[East Asia]] were sent from camps in India to Canada in June 1941 (''Camp 33).<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\nBy 19 April 1941, 61 prisoners had made a break for liberty from Canadian internment camps. The escapees included 28 German prisoners who escaped from the internment camp east of [[Port Arthur, Ontario]] in April 1941.<ref>{{cite web|title=28 Nazis escape from Canadian Prison Camp Nashua Telegraph |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OAlAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=q6QMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5764%2C1534515}}</ref>\n\n===Italian Canadian internment===\n{{main|Italian Canadian internment}}\nOn 10 June 1940, Italy joined the war on the axis side. After that, [[Italian Canadians]] were heavily scrutinized. Openly fascist organizations were deemed illegal while individuals with fascist inclinations were arrested most often without warrants. Organizations seen as openly fascist also had properties confiscated without warrants as well. A provision in the Canadian War Measures Act was immediately enacted by Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie|King]]. Named the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]], it allowed government authorities to take the needed measures to protect the country from internal threats and enemies. The same afternoon which Italy joined the axis powers, Italian consular and embassy officials were asked to leave as soon as physically possible. Canada, which was heavily involved in the war effort on the allies' side, saw the Italian communities as a breeding ground of likely internal threats and a haven of conceivable spy networks helping the fascist axis nations of Italy and Germany. Though many Italians were anti-fascist and no longer politically involved with their homeland, this did not stop 600-700 Italians from being sent to internment camps throughout Canada.<ref name=\"Massa, Evelyn Weinfield Pg 17-19\">Massa, Evelyn Weinfield, Morton: WE NEEDED TO PROVE WE WERE GOOD CANADIANS: CONTRASTING PARADIGMS FOR SUSPECT MINORITIES, pp. 17\u201319 Canadian Issues Spring 2009.</ref><ref>Carbone, Stanisla\u00f2: The Street Were Not Paved with Gold: A Social History of Italians in Winnipeg, pp. 70\u201373 Manitoba History, Number 29, Spring 1995.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italiancanadianww2.ca|title=Italian Canadians as Enemy Aliens: Memories of World War II|website=www.italiancanadianww2.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pier21.ca/culture-trunks/italy/history|title=History - Pier 21|website=www.pier21.ca}}</ref>\n\nThe first of these Italian prisoners were sent to Camp Petawawa situated in the Ottawa River Valley. By October 1940 the round up had already been completed. Italian Canadian Montrealer, Mario Duliani wrote, \"The City Without Women\" about his life in the internment camp Petawawa during World War II which describes a personal account of the struggles of the time. Throughout the country Italians were investigated by [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] officials who had a compiled list of Italian persons who were politically involved and deeply connected in the Italian communities. Most of the arrested individuals were from the Montreal and Toronto areas and pronounced [[enemy aliens]].<ref name=\"Massa, Evelyn Weinfield Pg 17-19\"/><ref name=\"[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]] Pg 21-22\">[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]]: Such Hardworking People, pp. 21\u201323 McGill-Queen's University Press.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, resentment and suspicion still lingered upon the Italian communities. Laval Fortier, commissioner for overseas immigration after the war wrote \"The Italian South Peasant is not the type we are looking for in Canada. His standard of living, his way of life, even his civilization seem so different that I doubt if he could ever become an asset to our country\".<ref>[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]]: Such Hardworking People, p. 22 McGill-Queen's University Press.</ref> Such remarks embedded a large proportion of the country that had negative views upon the Italian communities. A gallop poll released in 1946 showed 73 percent of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois were against immigration with 25 percent stating Italians were the group of people most wanted kept out. Such a stance upon the Italian people was evident even though years prior to the war had proven Italians were an asset to the Canadian economy and industry, for they accomplished critical jobs that were seen as very unappealing such as laying track across rural and dangerous landscapes and the construction of infrastructure in urban areas.<ref name=\"Massa, Evelyn Weinfield Pg 17-19\"/><ref name=\"[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]] Pg 21-22\"/>\n\n===Japanese Canadian internment and relocation centres===\n{{Main|Internment of Japanese Canadians}}\nDuring World War II, Canada interned residents of Japanese ancestry. Over 75% were Canadian nationals and they were vital in key areas of the economy, notably the fishery and also logging and berry farming. Exile took two forms: relocation centres for families and relatively well-off individuals who were a low security threat, and internment camps (often called concentration camps in contemporary accounts, but controversially so) which were for single men, the less well-off, and those deemed to be a security risk. After the war, many did not return to the Coast because of bitter feelings as to their treatment, and fears of further hostility from non-Japanese citizens; of those that returned only about 25% regained confiscated property and businesses. Most remained in other parts of Canada, notably certain parts of the [[British Columbia]] Interior and in the neighbouring province of Alberta.\n\n====Camps and relocation centres in the West Kootenay and Boundary regions====\nInternment camps, called \"relocation centres\", were at [[Greenwood, British Columbia|Greenwood]], [[Kaslo, British Columbia|Kaslo]], [[Lemon Creek, British Columbia|Lemon Creek]], [[New Denver, British Columbia|New Denver]], [[Rosebery, British Columbia|Rosebery]], [[Sandon, British Columbia|Sandon]], [[Slocan City, British Columbia|Slocan City]], and [[Tashme, British Columbia|Tashme]]. Some were nearly-empty [[ghost towns]] when the internment began, others, like Kaslo and Greenwood, while less populous than in their boom years, were substantial communities.\n\n====Self-supporting centres in the Lillooet-Fraser Canyon region====\nA different kind of camp, known as a self-supporting centre, was found in other regions. [[Shalalth|Bridge River]], [[Minto City]], [[McGillivray, British Columbia|McGillivray Falls]], [[Lillooet, British Columbia|East Lillooet]], Taylor Lake were in the [[Lillooet Country]] or nearby<!--Taylor Lake I'm not sure where it was, up by Green Lake/70 Mile maybe-->. Other than Taylor Lake, these were all called \"Self-supporting centres\", not internment camps. The first three listed were all in a mountainous area so physically isolated that fences and guards were not required as the only egress from that region was by rail or water. McGillivray Falls and [[Tashme]], on the [[Crowsnest Highway]] east of [[Hope, British Columbia]], were just over the minimum 100 miles from the Coast required by the deportation order, though Tashme had direct road access over that distance, unlike McGillivray. Because of the isolation of the country immediately coast-wards from McGillivray, men from that camp were hired to work at a sawmill in what has since been named [[Devine, British Columbia|Devine]], after the mill's owner, which is within the 100-mile quarantine zone. Many of those in the East Lillooet camp were hired to work in town, or on farms nearby, particularly at [[Fountain, British Columbia|Fountain]], while those at Minto and Minto Mine and those at Bridge River worked for the railway or the hydro company.<ref>[''My Sixty Years in Canada'', Masajiro Miyazaki, self publ.]</ref><ref>''Short Portage to Lillooet'', Irene Edwards, self-publ.

Split]]\n\n==Cuba==\n{{Main|Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rub\u00ed}}\nAfter [[Arsenio Mart\u00ednez Campos|Marshal Campos]] had failed to pacify the [[Spanish\u2013American War#Cuban struggle for independence|Cuban rebellion]], the Conservative government of [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo]] sent out [[Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rub\u00ed|Valeriano Weyler]]. This selection met the approval of most Spaniards, who thought him the proper man to crush the rebellion. While serving as a Spanish general, he was called \"Butcher Weyler\" because hundreds of thousands of people died in his [[concentration camp]]s.\n\nHe was made [[governor]] of Cuba with full powers to suppress the insurgency (rebellion was widespread in Cuba) and restore the island to political order and its sugar production to greater profitability. Initially, Weyler was greatly frustrated by the same factors that had made victory difficult for all generals of traditional standing armies fighting against an insurgency. While the Spanish troops marched in regulation and required substantial supplies, their opponents practiced hit-and-run tactics and lived off the land, blending in with the non-combatant population. He came to the same conclusions as his predecessors as well\u2014that to win Cuba back for Spain, he would have to separate the rebels from the civilians by putting the latter in safe havens, protected by loyal Spanish troops. By the end of 1897, General Weyler had relocated more than 300,000 into such \"reconcentration camps.\" Weyler learned this tactic from the [[American Civil War]] campaign of [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]] while assigned to the post of military attach\u00e9 in the Spanish Embassy in Washington D.C.. However, many mistakenly believe him to be to the origin of such tactics after it was later used by the British in the [[Second Boer War]] and later evolved into a designation to describe the [[concentration camps]] of the 20th century regimes of Hitler and Stalin. Although he was successful moving vast numbers of people, he failed to provide for them adequately. Consequently, these areas became cesspools of hunger and disease, where many hundreds of thousands died.\n\nWeyler's \"reconcentration\" policy had another important effect. Although it made Weyler's military objectives easier to accomplish, it had devastating political consequences. Although the Spanish Conservative government supported Weyler's tactics wholeheartedly, the Liberals denounced them vigorously for their toll on the Cuban civilian population. In the propaganda war waged in the United States, Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s made much of Weyler's inhumanity to their countrymen and won the sympathy of broad groups of the U.S. population to their cause. He was nicknamed \"the Butcher\" Weyler by journalists like [[William Randolph Hearst]].\n\nWeyler's strategy also backfired militarily due to the rebellion in the [[Philippines]] that required the redeployment by 1897 of some troops already in Cuba. When Prime Minister [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo]] was assassinated in June, Weyler lost his principal supporter in Spain. He resigned his post in late 1897 and returned to Europe. He was replaced in Cuba by the more conciliatory [[Ram\u00f3n Blanco y Erenas]].\n\n{{Main|Military Units to Aid Production}}\n{{See also|Human rights in Cuba}}\n[[Military Units to Aid Production]] were [[forced labor]] [[concentration camp]]s established by [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Communism|communist]] government, from November 1965 to July 1968.\n\nThey were a way to eliminate alleged \"[[bourgeois]]\" and \"[[counter-revolutionary]]\" values in the Cuban population. First, people were thrown into overcrowded cells at police stations and later taken to secret police facilities, cinemas, stadia, warehouses, and similar locations.

Once the White terror subsided, a few thousand including mainly small children and women, were set free, leaving 74,000\u201376,000 prisoners. The largest [[List of concentration and internment camps#Finland|prison camps]] were [[Suomenlinna]], an island facing Helsinki, [[H\u00e4meenlinna]], [[Lahti]], [[Vyborg|Viipuri]], [[Eken\u00e4s, Finland|Eken\u00e4s]], [[Riihim\u00e4ki]] and [[Tampere]]. The Senate made the decision to keep these prisoners detained until each person's guilt could be examined. A law for a ''Tribunal of Treason'' was enacted on 29 May after a long dispute between the White army and the Senate of the proper trial method to adopt. The start of the heavy and slow process of trials was delayed further until 18 June 1918. The Tribunal did not meet all the standards of neutral justice, due to the mental atmosphere of White Finland after the war. Approximately 70,000 Reds were convicted, mainly for complicity to treason. Most of the sentences were lenient, however, and many got out on parole. 555 persons were sentenced to death, of whom 113 were executed. The trials revealed also that some innocent persons had been imprisoned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1971}}, {{Harvnb|Kekkonen|1991}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen|1992|pp=140, 142}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentil\u00e4|Nevakivi|1999|p=112}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=161\u201378}}, Uta.fi/Suomi80/Yhteiskunta/Valtiorikosoikeudet</ref>\n\nCombined with the severe food shortage, the mass imprisonment led to high mortality rates in the camps, and the catastrophe was compounded by a mentality of punishment, anger and indifference on the part of the victors. Many prisoners felt that they were abandoned also by their own leaders, who had fled to Russia. The condition of the prisoners had weakened rapidly during May, after food supplies had been disrupted during the Red Guards' retreat in April, and a high number of prisoners had been captured already during the first half of April in Tampere and Helsinki. As a consequence, 2,900 starved to death or died in June as a result of diseases caused by malnutrition and [[Spanish flu]], 5,000 in July, 2,200 in August, and 1,000 in September. The mortality rate was highest in the [[Eken\u00e4s, Finland|Eken\u00e4s]] camp at 34%, while in the others the rate varied between 5% and 20%. In total, between 11,000 and 13,500 Finns perished.

The use of common criminals as [[Kapo (concentration camp)|Kapo]], to brutalize and assist in the handling of prisoners, was instituted at this time. In November 1938 the massive arrests of German Jews started, with most of them being immediately sent to the concentration camps, where they were separated from other prisoners and subjected to even harsher treatment.\n\nThe third phase started after the occupation of Poland in 1939. In the first few months Polish intellectuals were detained, including nearly the entire staff of [[Cracow University]] arrested in November 1939.<ref>{{cite book | title= History of Poland | isbn= 0-88029-858-8 | first= Oscar | last= Halecki | page= [https://archive.org/details/historyofpoland0000hale/page/313 313] | date= June 1992 | url-access= registration | url= https://archive.org/details/historyofpoland0000hale/page/313 }}</ref> [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-I]] and [[Stutthof concentration camp]] were built to house them and other political prisoners. Large numbers were executed or died from the brutal treatment and disease. After the occupation of Belgium, France and Netherlands in 1940, [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], [[Gross Rosen]] and [[Fort Breendonk]], in addition to a number of smaller camps, were set up to house intellectuals and political prisoners from those countries who had not already been executed.<ref>''Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 957.</ref> Many of these intellectuals were held first in [[Gestapo]] prisons, and those who were not executed immediately after interrogation were sent on to the concentration camps.\n\nInitially, Jews in the occupied countries were interned either in other KZ, but predominantly in [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939-1944|Ghettos]] that were walled off parts of cities. All the Jews in western Poland (annexed into the Reich) were transported to ghettos in the [[General Government]]. Jews were used for labour in industries, but usually transported to work then returned to the KZ or the ghetto at night. Although these ghettoes were not intended to be extermination camps, and there was no official policy to kill people, thousands died due to hunger, disease and extreme conditions. During the German advance into Russia in 1941 and 1942 Jewish soldiers and civilians were systematically executed by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' of the S.S. that followed the front-line troops. At the [[Wannsee Conference]] on 20 January 1942 the \"[[Final Solution]]\" was decreed to exterminate all of the remaining Jews in Europe, [[Heydrich]] stated that there were still 11 million to be eliminated.<ref>\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\" pp. 959\u201365</ref> To accomplish this special ''Vernichtungslager'' ('''extermination camps''') were organized. The first was [[Che\u0142mno extermination camp|Che\u0142mno]] in which 152,000, mainly from the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] ghetto, were killed. The method for carrying out mass murder was tested and perfected here. During 1942 and 1943 further camps [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau II]], part of [[Majdanek]], [[Treblinka]], [[Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp|Be\u0142\u017cec]] and [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]] were built for this purpose. Jews from other concentration camps, and from the ghettos, were transported to them from all over occupied Europe. In these six camps alone, an estimated 3.1 million Jews were killed in gas chambers and the bodies burned in massive crematoria. The Nazis realized that this was a criminal act {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the action was shrouded in secrecy. The extermination camps were destroyed in 1944 and early 1945 and buried. However the Soviet armies overran Auschwitz and Majdanek before the evidence could be totally destroyed.\n[[File:Buchenwald-bei-Weimar-am-24-April-1945.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator [[Alben W. Barkley]] views the bodies of prisoners at a liberated [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] in April 1945]]\n\nAnother category of internment camp in Nazi Germany was the '''[[Labor camp]]''' (''[[Arbeitslager]]''). They housed civilians from the occupied countries that were being used to work in industry, on the farms, in quarries, in mines and on the railroads. Approximately 12,000,000 forced laborers, most of whom were [[Eastern Europe]]ans, were enslaved in the German war economy inside the [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1757323,00.html|title=Final Compensation Pending for Former Nazi Forced Laborers |date= 27 October 2005|website=DW.COM|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |title=Forced Labor at Ford Werke AG during the Second World War |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014235036/http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |archivedate=14 October 2007 }}</ref> The workers were mostly young and taken from the occupied countries, predominantly eastern Europe, but also many French and Italian. They were sometimes taken willingly, more frequently as a result of ''[[lapanka]]'' in Polish, or ''rafle'' in French language, in which people were collected on the street or in their home by police drives. However, for often very minor infractions of the rules, workers were imprisoned in special ''Arbeitserziehungslager'', [[German language|German]] for '''worker re-education camp''' (abbreviated to AEL and sometimes referred to as ''Straflager'').<ref>de:Arbeiterserziehungslager</ref> These punishment camps were operated by the [[Gestapo]] and many of the inmates were executed or died from the brutal treatment.\n\nFinally there was one category of internment camp, called [[Ilag]] in which Allied (mainly British and American) civilians were held. These civilians had been caught behind front lines by the rapid advance of the German armies, or the sudden entry of the United States into the war. In these camps the Germans abided by the rules of the [[Third Geneva Convention]]. Deaths resulted from sickness or simply old age.\n\nAfter World War II, internment camps were used by the Allied occupying forces to hold suspected Nazis, usually using the facilities of previous Nazi camps. They were all closed down by 1949. In [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] the communist government used prison camps to hold political prisoners, opponents of the communist regime or suspected Nazi collaborators.\n* [[Bad Nenndorf interrogation centre]]\n\n{{See also|Nazi concentration camp badges|List of concentration camps of Nazi Germany|List of concentration camps for Poles|Extermination of Soviet prisoners of war by Nazi Germany|Ilag}}\n\n==Hong Kong==\nDuring the Second World War the Japanese, during their occupation of Hong Kong, interned enemy nationals (mostly British, Canadian, American and Dutch), in several internment camps in Hong Kong. Camps existed at:\n\n* [[Sham Shui Po]] \u2013 A concentration camp was maintained here for most of the duration of the Second World War.\n* Stanley Internment Camp \u2013 Located primarily on the grounds of [[St. Stephen's College, Hong Kong|St. Stephen's College]].

The Japanese later merged the College with part of Stanley Prison to form the full Stanley Internment Camp.\n* Stanley Prison \u2013 Located primarily in the Officer's housing blocks at the prison. During the Japanese occupation, the grounds of the prison were used as part of Stanley Internment Camp. Nearly 600 prisoners of war and civilians, killed by the Japanese during the occupation, are buried in the nearby Stanley War Cemetery (which is NOT part of the prison itself but adjacent to it).\n\n== India, British ==\nDuring both World Wars the British interned enemy nationals (mostly Germans).

By March 1942 many civilians, particularly westerners in the region's European colonies, found themselves behind enemy lines and were subsequently interned by the Japanese.\n\nThe nature of civilian internment varied from region to region. Some civilians were interned soon after invasion; in other areas the process occurred over many months. In total, approximately 130,000 Allied civilians were interned by the Japanese during this period of occupation. The exact number of internees will never be known as records were often lost, destroyed, or simply not kept.\n[[File:73-Japanse kampen in Nederlands-Indi\u00eb.jpg|thumb|Liberated Dutch prisoners in Indonesia (Dutch East Indies) in 1945]]\nThe backgrounds of the internees were diverse. There was a large proportion of Dutch from the [[Dutch East Indies]], but they also included Americans, British, and Australians. They included missionaries and their families, colonial administrators, and business people. Many had been living in the colonies for decades. Single women had often been nuns, missionaries, doctors, teachers and nurses.\n\nCivilians interned by the Japanese were treated marginally better than the prisoners of war, but their death rates were the same. Although they had to work to run their own camps, few were made to labour on construction projects. The Japanese devised no consistent policies or guidelines to regulate the treatment of the civilians. Camp conditions and the treatment of internees varied from camp to camp. The general experience, however, was one of malnutrition, disease, and varying degrees of harsh discipline and brutality from the Japanese guards. Some [[Dutch people|Dutch]] women were forced into [[sexual slavery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html |title=Comfort Women Were 'Raped': U.S. Ambassador to Japan |accessdate=12 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324104443/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html |archivedate=24 March 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/abe-ignores-evidence-say-australias-comfort-women/2007/03/02/1172338881441.html|title=Abe ignores evidence, say Australia's 'comfort women' |website=www.theage.com.au|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe camps varied in size from four people held at Pangkalpinang in Sumatra to the 14,000 held in [[Tjihapit]] in Java. Some were segregated according to gender or race, there were also many camps of mixed gender. Some internees were held at the same camp for the duration of the war, and others were moved about. The buildings used to house internees were generally whatever was available, including schools, warehouses, universities, hospitals, and prisons.\n[[File:Jean-marie-and-private-tanner.jpg|thumb|left|Jean-Marie Faggiano receives a doll from [[Private First Class]] Theo Tanner of the U.S. First Cavalry. Tanner had just removed the doll from a dead Japanese soldier, killed during the liberation of the Santo Tomas Internment Camp in Manila, Philippines in February 1945]]\n\nOrganisation of the internment camps varied by location. The Japanese administered some camps directly; others were administered by local authorities under Japanese control. Korean POWs of the Japanese were also used as camp guards. Some of the camps were left for the internees to self-govern. In the mixed and male camps, management often fell to the men who were experienced in administration before their internment. In the women's camps the leaders tended to be the women who had held a profession prior to internment. Boys over the age of ten were generally considered to be men by the Japanese and were often separated from their mothers to live and work in male camps.\n\nOne of the most famous concentration camps operated by the Japanese during World War II was at the [[University of Santo Tomas]] in [[Manila]], the Philippines, the [[Santo Tomas Internment Camp]]. The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] university was expropriated by the Japanese at the beginning of the occupation, and was used to house mostly American civilians, but also British subjects, for the duration of the war. There, men, women and children suffered from malnutrition and poor sanitation. The camp was liberated in 1945.\n\nThe liberation of the camps was not a uniform process. Many camps were liberated as the forces were recapturing territory. For other internees, freedom occurred many months after the surrender of the Japanese, and in the Dutch East Indies, liberated internees faced the uncertainty of the [[Indonesian War of Independence]].\n\nCivilian internees were generally disregarded in official histories, and few received formal recognition. Ironically, however, civilian internees have become the subject of several influential books and films. [[Agnes Newton Keith]]'s account of internment on [[Berhala Island, Sabah|Berhala Island]] in [[Sandakan|Sandakan Harbour]] and [[Batu Lintang camp]], Kuching, ''[[Three Came Home]]'' (1947), was one of the first of the memoirs. More recent publications include Jeanne Tuttle and Jolanthe Zelling's \"Mammie's Journal of My Childhood\" (2005); (Shirley Fenton-Huie's ''The Forgotten Ones'' (1992) and Jan Ruff O'Herne's ''Fifty Years of Silence'' (1997). Nevil Shute's novel ''[[A Town Like Alice]]'' was filmed in 1956, and J. G. Ballard's ''[[Empire of the Sun]]'' in 1987.

From 1922 to 1928, Italian forces under General [[Pietro Badoglio]] waged a punitive pacification campaign. Badoglio's successor in the field, Marshal [[Rodolfo Graziani]] (known as 'The Butcher of Fezzan'), accepted the commission from Mussolini on the condition that he be allowed to crush the Libyan resistance unencumbered by the restraints of either Italian or international law. Reportedly, Mussolini immediately agreed and Graziani intensified the [[oppression]]. The Libyans continued to defend themselves, with the strongest voices of dissent coming from the Cyrenaica.

By far the largest camp was the one for British sailors and soldiers in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. Unlike the [[Prisoners of War|PoWs]] at the time in the neighbouring countries, Dutch prisoners had plenty of food, and tradesmen often came to the camp with a wide range of goods. The interned were paid a certain amount of compensation money by the Dutch authorities on top of any British aid that got channeled to them through the Dutch government. One prisoner later commented: \"... we were quite well off, and the local people were very good to us.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatwar.nl/index.html|title=British sailors in Groningen camp|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAfter a revolt in 1926 in the [[Dutch East Indies]], a concentration camp for political prisoners was set up in what then was called [[Netherlands New Guinea]], in the very remote jungle at [[Boven-Digoel]] (Upper-Digul).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dr L. de Jong, ''Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog'' ('' The Kingdom of the Netherlands during WWII''), Amsterdam, RIOD, 1966</ref>\n\nJust before World War II engulfed the Netherlands, a camp was built in 1939 at [[Westerbork (village)|Westerbork]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government for interning Jewish refugees who had fled [[Nazi Germany]]. During the German occupation [[Westerbork transit camp|this camp]] was used as a transit camp for Dutch Jews eventually deported to [[extermination camp]]s in the East. [[Amersfoort concentration camp|Amersfoort]] (1941\u20131945) (in German: ''Polizeiliches Durchgangslager'') was also a transit camp. The [[Herzogenbusch concentration camp|Herzogenbusch]] camp (1943\u20131944, known as ''[[Kamp Vught]]'' because of its location in that town) was a concentration camp, the only one in Western Europe outside Germany set up as well as run by the [[SS]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nOther camps were [[Kamp Schoorl|camp Schoorl]] near Schoorl and [[Kamp Erika|camp Erika]] near Ommen. Before the [[Shoah]] began, some two dozen labor camps for Jewish men were operated fulfilling an order of the German occupiers. In the Dutch East Indies, after the occupation of the Netherlands by the Germans in Europe started on 15 May 1940, Germans living in the Indies were rounded up and interned there. Almost all camps also had field offices for forced labor. In the case of Vught as well as Amersfoort work details for [[Philips]] factories existed, often under relatively favourable circumstances. Also, the huge construction activities for the 30 German airfields in the Netherlands relied partly upon labour from camps.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAfter the war, the Dutch government launched the [[Operation Black Tulip]] and started to gather civil population of German background to concentration camps near the German border, especially [[Nijmegen]], in order to deport them from the country. In total around 15% of the German population in the Netherlands was deported.\n\nNumerous improvised and official camps were set up after the war, to keep Dutch who were suspected of collaboration with the Germans. Kamp Westerbork at one point housed some Jews as well as suspected collaborators and Germans. In these camps, a history of maltreatment by the guards, sometimes leading to death, has been collected.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==New Zealand==\nIn World War I German civilians living in New Zealand were interned in camps on [[Motuihe Island|Motuihe]] and [[Somes Island|Somes]] Islands.

Within 6 months the 112 alien tribunals had individually summoned and examined 64,000 aliens, and the vast majority were released, having been found to be \"friendly aliens\" (mostly [[Jews]]); examples include [[Hermann Bondi]] and [[Thomas Gold]] and later members of the [[Amadeus Quartet]]. British nationals were detained under [[Defence Regulation 18B]]. Eventually only 2,000 of the remainder were interned. Initially they were shipped overseas, but that was halted when a German [[U-boat]] sank the SS ''[[Arandora Star]]'' in July 1940 with the loss of 800 internees, though this was not the first loss that had occurred. The last internees were released late in 1945, though many were released in 1942. In Britain, internees were housed in camps and prisons. Some camps had tents rather than buildings with internees sleeping directly on the ground. Men and women were separated and most contact with the outside world was denied.

Known as [[New Village]]s, these camps were intended to become permanent settlements. As attacks by the [[Malayan Communist Party]] declined, the curfews were lifted, fences removed, and the camps gradually ceased to be internment camps. To this day many villages founded in this way are known as New Villages and remain ethnically Chinese.\n\n===Northern Ireland===\n{{Main|Operation Demetrius}}\nOne of the most famous example of modern ''internment'' (and one which made world headlines) occurred in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1971, when hundreds of [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] and [[Irish republicanism|Irish Republicans]] were arrested by the [[British Army]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] on the orders of then [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[Brian Faulkner]], with the backing of the [[British government]]. Historians generally view that period of internment as inflaming [[sectarian]] tensions in Northern Ireland while failing in its stated aim of arresting members of the paramilitary [[Provisional IRA]]. Many of the people arrested were completely unconnected with the Provisional IRA but, through bungling and incompetence, had their names appear on the list of those to be interned,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} while over 100 IRA men escaped arrest. The backlash against internment and its bungled application contributed to the decision of the British government under Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] to suspend the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Stormont governmental]] system in Northern Ireland and replace it with ''[[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|Direct rule]]'' from London, under the authority of a British [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]].\n\nFrom 1971 internment began, beginning with the arrest of 342 suspected republican guerrillas and paramilitary members on 9 August. They were held at [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|HM Prison]] [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze]] then called [[Long Kesh Detention Centre]]. By 1972, 924 men were interned. Serious rioting ensued, and 23 people died in three days. The [[British government]] attempted to show some balance by arresting some [[loyalist]] paramilitaries later, but out of the 1,981 men interned,<ref name=\"joint2005p110\" /> only 107 were loyalists. Internment was ended in 1975, but had resulted in increased support for the IRA and created political tensions which culminated in the [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike]] and the death of [[Bobby Sands]], member of British Parliament ([[Anti H-Block|Anti H-Block/Armagh Political Prisoner]] Party.)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/northern_ireland/understanding/events/hunger_strike.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Hunger Strike |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/election/rwby1981a.htm |title=CAIN: Politics: Elections: Westminster By-election (NI) Thursday 9 April 1981 |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=9 April 1981 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> His death resulted in a new surge of IRA recruitment and activity. The imprisonment of people under anti-terrorism laws specific to Northern Ireland continued until the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998, but these laws required the [[right to a fair trial]] be respected. However non-jury [[Diplock court]]s tried paramilitary-related trials, to prevent [[Perverting the course of justice|jury intimidation]].\n\nMany of those interned were held in a detention facility located at [[RAF Long Kesh]] military base, later known as [[RAF Long Kesh|Long Kesh Detention Centre]] and eventually becoming [[HM Prison Maze|Her Majesty's Prison Maze]], outside [[Belfast]]. Internment had previously been used as a means of repressing the [[Irish Republican Army]]. It was used between 1939\u20131945 and 1956\u20131962.

Locations as identified by the historian Simon Webb include [[Rothesay, Bute|Rothesay]] on the [[Isle of Bute]], and [[Tighnabruaich]] on the Scottish mainland. Rothesay was used to house the political enemies of the leader of the Polish Government in Exile, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], as well as Poles considered by Sikorski's Government in Exile of being morally dubious. [[Tighnabruaich]] held criminals under the jurisdiction of the Polish Government in Exile. Webb claims the Poles were later allowed to open further camps at [[Kingledoors]], [[Auchterarder]] and [[Inverkeithing]] near [[Edinburgh]].

Traditionally each home had its own sourdough yeast - ''raugas'', which also had symbolical meaning of the home.  [[Rye bread]] is often eaten as an open-faced sandwich, [[butter]]ed or spread with cheese. It is sometimes flavored with [[caraway]], or with some onion. Traditional bread is baked on [[sweet flag]] leaves. Lithuanian proverb says - ''Be aukso apsieis, be duonos ne'' (''One can manage without gold, but not without bread'').\n\nSome varieties of Lithuanian bread contain whole seeds of rye and wheat; this type of bread is referred to as ''gr\u016bd\u0117toji'', i.e. \"seeded\" bread.\n\n==Vegetables and spices==\n\n[[File:Illustration_Heracleum_sphondylium0.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Heracleum sphondylium]]'' (''Lankinis bar\u0161tis'') was used since prehistory up to the 18th century to make an archaic version of ''bar\u0161\u010diai'' soup]]\n\n[[File:Brassica rapa (watercolor).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Brassica rapa]]'' (rop\u0117) was a popular root vegetable before the prevalence of potatoes in the 18th century.]]\n\nThe most commonly used vegetable in Lithuanian recipes is the [[potato]]; in its simplest forms, it is boiled, baked, or sauteed, often garnished with [[dill]], but a tremendous{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} variety of potato recipes exist. Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.\n\n[[Cucumber]]s, [[dill pickle]]s, [[radish]]es and greens are quite popular. [[Beet]]s (''burokai'') are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making [[borscht]] and side dishes. [[Cabbage]] is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for [[soup]]s, or wrapped around fillings (''baland\u0117liai''). [[Tomato]]es are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior.\n\nLithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, [[horseradish]] (''krienai''), [[dill]] (''krapai''), [[caraway]] seed (''kmynai''), [[garlic]], [[bay leaf]], [[juniper]] berries (''kadagio uogos''), hemp seeds and fruit essences.  [[Vanilla]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back after independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.\n\nPickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.\n\n==Foraging: berries and mushrooms, edible wild plants==\n\nOne of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is pretty much alive to this day.\n\nMushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the [[Dz\u016bkija]] region from [[Druskininkai]] to [[Vilnius]]; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms being used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:\n* ''Baravykas'' \u2013 [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]];\n* ''Voverait\u0117'' (literally, ''little squirrel''), ''lepe\u0161ka'' (in [[Dz\u016bkija]] region) \u2013 [[chanterelle]];\n* ''Gudukas'', ''vokietukas'', ''kalpokas'', ''vi\u0161tel\u0117'' \u2013 [[Cortinarius caperatus|gypsy mushroom]].\n\n''Baravykas'' is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried ''baravykas'' has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. ''Voverait\u0117'' is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. Most common dish of this mushroom is ''voverait\u0117'' sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. ''Gudukas'', arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as ''lep\u0161\u0117'' ([[Leccinum scabrum]]), ''raudonvir\u0161is'' or ''raudonikis'' (literally, \"red-topped\") ([[Leccinum aurantiacum]]), ''makavykas'' ([[Suillus variegatus]]), ''\u0161ilbaravykis'' ([[Xerocomus badius]]), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as ''baravykas''.\n\nWild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. [[Bilberry|Bilberries]] (''m\u0117lyn\u0117s'') and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (''brukn\u0117s'') are the two most abundant species of wild berries. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] (''spanguol\u0117s'') are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to [[\u010cepkeliai Marsh]]. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (''blynai''). Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. [[Fragaria vesca|Wild strawberries]] (''\u017eemuog\u0117s'') are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Foraging\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"165\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Boletus edulis EtgHollande 041031 091.jpg|Boletus, the \"King of Mushrooms\"\nFile:Chanterelle Cantharellus cibarius.jpg|[[Chanterelle]]s are popular mushrooms in Lithuania\nFile:Vaccinium vitis-idaea 20060824 003.jpg|Lingonberry\nFile:\u010cu\u010doriedky.jpg|Bilberry\nFile:Suillus brevipes 78.jpg|Butter-mushroom\nFile:Fragaria_vesca_2.jpg|Strawberry\nFile:Glyceria fluitans \u2014 Flora Batava \u2014 Volume v8.jpg|''[[Glyceria fluitans]]'' (''paprastoji mona\u017eol\u0117'').

During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews ([[kompot]]s). [[Gooseberry|Gooseberries]] (''agrastai'') and [[Ribes|currant]]s (''serbentai'') are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts. Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced. Apple cheese which is considered a desert is very popular in autumn. Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family|Radvila family]] chef from the 17th century.\n\n==Meat==\n[[File:Salo.JPG|200px|thumb|A small slab of ''la\u0161iniai'' with an onion]]\n[[File:Skilandis2.jpg|200px|thumb|''[[Skilandis]]'' is a Lithuanian matured sausage made of meat, fat, salt, pepper and garlic.

There are many varieties of smoked pork, including [[ham]] and a soft [[sausage]] with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches. [[Skilandis]] is a popular Lithuanian sausage added to the list of EU's [[Protected Designation of Origin|Protected Designations of Origin]]. The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania - the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. Skilandis was smoked in a special room - ''kaminas'' which was used for cooking.\n\n==Fish==\n\nFreshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]] or [[perch]], are often baked whole or stuffed. [[Herring]] is marinated, baked, fried, or served in [[aspic]].

Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; [[curd cheese]] (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. Lithuanian butter and cream is unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on.

These cakes are cut into squares for serving. [[Poppy seed]] is sometimes used as a swirl filling in dessert bread ([[Poppy seed roll]] and [[\u0161imtalapis]]) and as a flavoring in other pastries.\n\nFor special occasions, [[torte]] may be prepared; they often consist of 10 to 20 layers, filled with jam and vanilla, chocolate, [[Cafe mocha|mocha]], or rum [[buttercream]]s; they are lavishly decorated. Lithuanian coffeehouses (''kavin\u0117'') serve a variety of tortes and pastries to attract evening strollers.\n\nDesserts include:\n*''\u017dagar\u0117liai'' (also known as krustai or chrustai) - Twisted, thin deep-fried pastries dusted with powdered sugar; identical to Scandinavian [[Klejner]] cookies, similar to Mexican [[bu\u00f1uelo]].\n*''K\u016b\u010diukai'' or ''\u0161li\u017eikai'' - very small rolls are baked and served with [[opium poppy|poppy]]seed milk; this is a traditional [[K\u016b\u010dios|K\u016b\u010dios']] ([[Christmas Eve]]) dish.\n*''Ledai'' - [[ice cream]] is served everywhere in the summer.\n*''[[Doughnut|Spurgos]]'' - a Lithuanian variant of doughnuts, sometimes filled with preserves. The main difference from doughnuts or berliners is that the Lithuanian version uses curd as a basis. Therefore, they often called ''var\u0161k\u0117s spurgos'' - ''curd doughnuts''.\n*''[[\u0160akotis]]'' (also called ''raguotis'') - is essentially a pound cake grilled layer by layer, with a very distinctive branching form. It is a Lithuanian variant of a spit cake which is a distant cousin of the German [[Baumkuchen]], the French [[g\u00e2teau \u00e0 la broche]], the Swedish [[Spettekaka|sp\u00e4ttekaka]]. Some sources attribute its invention to [[Yotvingians]] - ancient, now extinct [[Balts|Baltic]] tribe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Polish Food 101 \u2012 S\u0119kacz |url=https://culture.pl/en/article/polish-food-101-sekacz |accessdate=22 April 2019 |quote=It's possible that Lithuanians, who allegedly ate s\u0119kacz on their way to Grunwald before the great battle of 1410, got the idea from the Germans.

The diners touch their eggs together as a sort of toast (among the children, this custom sometimes devolves into a smashing contest). Dinner may be roast goose or ham and accompaniments. Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.\n*Birthdays - The family's favorite cake is served. Traditionally in Lithuania the day of the saint after whom one was named was celebrated by the family as well as one's own birth date; for instance, a John would celebrate his name day on St. John's Day ([[Jonin\u0117s]]), June 23.\n*Christmas Eve ([[K\u016b\u010dios]]) - Twelve dishes are presented on a table spread with hay and lit by candles. No animal products, including dairy products or eggs, can be consumed as part of this meal. However, fish is permitted and regularly forms part of the meal. This custom is widespread in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Eastern Europe]], but traditions vary to different families. It is supposed that rituals and servicing of the Christmas Eve table reflect the most ancient Lithuanian traditions.\n*Weddings - The widest possible variety of courses are served. A special bread is sometimes baked and adorned with flowers and bird-shaped decorations, or a [[\u0161akotis]] is decorated. The ideal Lithuanian wedding lasts at least two days, so a great deal of cooking and baking goes on.\n*Funerals - The bereaved family usually hosts a dinner for all the mourners at a restaurant or other similar venue.\n*Informal gatherings and cocktail parties - The hosts often serve small open-face sandwiches, similar to those at a Scandinavian [[smorgasbord]], topped with smoked fish, sausage, cucumbers, and so forth. Flavored vodkas, which may have been concocted with fruits and herbs according to the host's or hostess's own family recipe, may be served.\n\n==Drinks==\n\n===Beer===\n{{Main|Beer in Lithuania}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | caption_align     = left\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n | total_width       = 400\n | header            = \n | header_align      = left/right/center\n | header_background = \n | footer            = \n | footer_align      = left/right/center\n | footer_background = \n | width             = \n | image1            = Lithuanian-beer.jpg\n | width1            = \n | caption1          = Traditional Lithuanian beer has an earthy and yeasty flavour, rich color of the clay or straw.\n | image2            = Bir\u017e\u0173 1686 Jubiliejinis Alus (9834933134).jpg\n | width2            = \n | caption2          = Bir\u017e\u0173 alus.

Several Lithuanian beers have won international awards. Local breweries are enjoying a renaissance. Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage. Lithuania has a long farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles. Beer was brewed for ancient Baltic [[Festival|festivities]] and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|website=www.llti.lt|page=18|title=Alus \u2013 apeiginis balt\u0173 g\u0117rimas|accessdate=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808021048/http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was ''Ragutis'' or ''R\u016bgutis''. Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.\n\nFarmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/lithuanian-beer-guide/book.pdf|website=www.garshol.priv.no|page=5|title=Lithuanian beer - A rough guide|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersofeurope.org/uploads/mycms-files/documents/publications/2016/stats_2016_web.pdf|website=www.brewersofeurope.org|title=Beer statistics - 2016 edition|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.\n\n===Midus===\n\n''[[Midus]]'' is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of [[mead]] made from honey. [[Baltic people]] were making ''midus'' for thousands of years. One of the first mentionings of Balts and mead was by the 9th-century traveller [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]], who visited [[Old Prussians|Prussians]].  Old Lithuanian mead was made from a solution of honey and water simmered with various spices, such as thyme, lemon, cinnamon, cherries, linden blossoms, juniper berries, and hops.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kublickas |first1=Rimantas |title=Traditional Foods |pages=339\u2013343 |chapter=Midus: A Traditional Lithuanian Mead |doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7648-2_27 |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4899-7646-8 }}</ref>\nOldest recipe of Lithuanian ''midus'' was recorded in a book by [[Olaus Magnus]] ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]]'', published in Rome in 1555.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Lau\u017eikas R. |author2=Astrauskas A. |title=How the Future King of England Ate Peacock in Vilnius: the Shared Cultural, Political and Culinary History of Britain and Lithuania |date=2018 |publisher=Lietuvos kult\u016bros institutas |location=Vilnius |isbn=9786098015652 |pages=135}}</ref>  ''Midus'' was considered a drink of nobleman and gentry.

Initiatives of B.Karazija made a fruit wine a traditional drink in Lithuania. Currently blueberry, apple, apple ice wine, black currant, aronia, cherry wines being produced by smaller and bigger companies.\n\n===Other===\n*''Arbata ([[tea]])'' - [[chamomile]], [[rosehip]], [[thyme]] and other herbal teas are popular as well as black tea. Many herbal infusions are used for medicinal purposes.\n*''Gira ([[kvass]])'' is a non-alcoholic beverage made by the natural fermentation of wheat, rye, or barley bread, sometimes flavoured with fruit, berries, raisins or birch sap; it is similar to Russian or Ukrainian [[kvass]]. Those brewed from rye [[bread]] and from [[caraway]] seed are popular and distributed in glass bottles. There is also a carbonated soft drink known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.\n*''Degtin\u0117 (\"the burn\")'' is the Lithuanian version of [[vodka]], traditionally made from rye. Produced domestically, its quality ranges from basic to triple-[[Distilled beverage|distilled]].\n*''Kava ([[coffee]])'' is brewed in [[espresso]] makers or [[Moka pot|moka pots]] at home, or with espresso machines in cafes. It is quite strong and usually sweetened. Coffeehouses (''kavin\u0117'') can be found not only on every street corner in towns but at highway rest stops and at every point of interest. First traditionally Lithuanians roasted oak acorns and made ''gili\u0173 kava'' (acorn coffee) - a substitute for natural bean coffee. The first coffeehouses appeared in Lithuania in the 18th century and in 1814 there were 49 coffeehouses in Vilnius.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Balsevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117-\u0160lekien\u0117 |first1=Virginija |title=Vilniaus kavin\u0117s istoriniuose \u0161altiniuose ir memuaruose |url=http://www.su.lt/bylos/fakultetai/humanitarinis/ml/acta/acta-h-15/slekiene.pdf |accessdate=2 May 2019 |language=LT |format=PDF}}</ref> Journalist Rapolas Mackonis was explorer of cafe life and wrote about culture of cafes in Vilnius and Kaunas. \n*''[[Starka]]'', an aged vodka, as well as [[Krupnikas]], a honey liqueur, are traditional drinks dating from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 16th - 18th centuries.\n*''[[Bitters|Trauktin\u0117]]'' (a bitter) is a strong herbal vodka; there are many varieties. It is also used as traditional medicine. ''Trejos devynerios'' (\"999\"), steeped with 27 different herbs, is one of the best known.\n* ''Vynas'' ([[wine]]) culture is firmly growing in Lithuania - wineries and specialised wine shops for Italian, French, New World wines operate in biggest cities. The wine exhibition ''Vyno dienos'' (''Days of Wine'') taking place in May, is the largest wine exhibition in Northern Europe. Lithuania historically is a wine importer, since its climate isn't very friendly for growing grapevines.\n\n==Contemporary cuisine and restaurants==\n[[File:Benediktas food market, Vilnius, Lithuania, June 2018.jpg|thumb|Modern food market ''Benediktas'' in Vilnius]]\n\nCurrently, Lithuania is affected by modern cuisine trends - fusion, new Nordic, craft beer, craft food.

Game was also a staple of noblemen: [[European bison|wisents]], [[aurochs]], and deer were hunted. Lithuania had long-lasting wars (about 200 years) with Teutonic Order. It also kept diplomatic relationships with it, during which various presents were exchanged - it is known what Teutonic Order sent a rare wine to [[Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania]], wife of [[Vytautas the Great]], in 1416. At this time Lithuanian nobleman already imported saffron, cinnamon, rice, pepper, raisins for their needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukininkopatarejas.lt/istorike-jolanta-karpaviciene-valdovu-sutuoktines-buvo-tikros-europietes/|title=Istorik\u0117 Jolanta Karpavi\u010dien\u0117: \"Valdov\u0173 sutuoktin\u0117s buvo tikros europiet\u0117s\"|website=ukininkopatarejas.lt|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Congress of Lutsk]], hosted by Vytautas the Great, was another example of medieval Lithuanian cuisine.

Bona Sforza introduced the fork and traditional Italian food - olives, olive oil; made wine and wheat flour more popular. Parsnips, cauliflowers, spinach and even artichokes were introduced and grown.

Traditionally each home had its own sourdough yeast - ''raugas'', which also had symbolical meaning of the home.  [[Rye bread]] is often eaten as an open-faced sandwich, [[butter]]ed or spread with cheese. It is sometimes flavored with [[caraway]], or with some onion. Traditional bread is baked on [[sweet flag]] leaves. Lithuanian proverb says - ''Be aukso apsieis, be duonos ne'' (''One can manage without gold, but not without bread'').\n\nSome varieties of Lithuanian bread contain whole seeds of rye and wheat; this type of bread is referred to as ''gr\u016bd\u0117toji'', i.e. \"seeded\" bread.\n\n==Vegetables and spices==\n\n[[File:Illustration_Heracleum_sphondylium0.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Heracleum sphondylium]]'' (''Lankinis bar\u0161tis'') was used since prehistory up to the 18th century to make an archaic version of ''bar\u0161\u010diai'' soup]]\n\n[[File:Brassica rapa (watercolor).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Brassica rapa]]'' (rop\u0117) was a popular root vegetable before the prevalence of potatoes in the 18th century.]]\n\nThe most commonly used vegetable in Lithuanian recipes is the [[potato]]; in its simplest forms, it is boiled, baked, or sauteed, often garnished with [[dill]], but a tremendous{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} variety of potato recipes exist. Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.\n\n[[Cucumber]]s, [[dill pickle]]s, [[radish]]es and greens are quite popular. [[Beet]]s (''burokai'') are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making [[borscht]] and side dishes. [[Cabbage]] is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for [[soup]]s, or wrapped around fillings (''baland\u0117liai''). [[Tomato]]es are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior.\n\nLithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, [[horseradish]] (''krienai''), [[dill]] (''krapai''), [[caraway]] seed (''kmynai''), [[garlic]], [[bay leaf]], [[juniper]] berries (''kadagio uogos''), hemp seeds and fruit essences.  [[Vanilla]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back after independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.\n\nPickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.\n\n==Foraging: berries and mushrooms, edible wild plants==\n\nOne of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is pretty much alive to this day.\n\nMushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the [[Dz\u016bkija]] region from [[Druskininkai]] to [[Vilnius]]; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms being used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:\n* ''Baravykas'' \u2013 [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]];\n* ''Voverait\u0117'' (literally, ''little squirrel''), ''lepe\u0161ka'' (in [[Dz\u016bkija]] region) \u2013 [[chanterelle]];\n* ''Gudukas'', ''vokietukas'', ''kalpokas'', ''vi\u0161tel\u0117'' \u2013 [[Cortinarius caperatus|gypsy mushroom]].\n\n''Baravykas'' is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried ''baravykas'' has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. ''Voverait\u0117'' is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. Most common dish of this mushroom is ''voverait\u0117'' sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. ''Gudukas'', arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as ''lep\u0161\u0117'' ([[Leccinum scabrum]]), ''raudonvir\u0161is'' or ''raudonikis'' (literally, \"red-topped\") ([[Leccinum aurantiacum]]), ''makavykas'' ([[Suillus variegatus]]), ''\u0161ilbaravykis'' ([[Xerocomus badius]]), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as ''baravykas''.\n\nWild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. [[Bilberry|Bilberries]] (''m\u0117lyn\u0117s'') and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (''brukn\u0117s'') are the two most abundant species of wild berries. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] (''spanguol\u0117s'') are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to [[\u010cepkeliai Marsh]]. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (''blynai''). Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. [[Fragaria vesca|Wild strawberries]] (''\u017eemuog\u0117s'') are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Foraging\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"165\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Boletus edulis EtgHollande 041031 091.jpg|Boletus, the \"King of Mushrooms\"\nFile:Chanterelle Cantharellus cibarius.jpg|[[Chanterelle]]s are popular mushrooms in Lithuania\nFile:Vaccinium vitis-idaea 20060824 003.jpg|Lingonberry\nFile:\u010cu\u010doriedky.jpg|Bilberry\nFile:Suillus brevipes 78.jpg|Butter-mushroom\nFile:Fragaria_vesca_2.jpg|Strawberry\nFile:Glyceria fluitans \u2014 Flora Batava \u2014 Volume v8.jpg|''[[Glyceria fluitans]]'' (''paprastoji mona\u017eol\u0117'').

During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews ([[kompot]]s). [[Gooseberry|Gooseberries]] (''agrastai'') and [[Ribes|currant]]s (''serbentai'') are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts. Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced. Apple cheese which is considered a desert is very popular in autumn. Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family|Radvila family]] chef from the 17th century.\n\n==Meat==\n[[File:Salo.JPG|200px|thumb|A small slab of ''la\u0161iniai'' with an onion]]\n[[File:Skilandis2.jpg|200px|thumb|''[[Skilandis]]'' is a Lithuanian matured sausage made of meat, fat, salt, pepper and garlic.

There are many varieties of smoked pork, including [[ham]] and a soft [[sausage]] with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches. [[Skilandis]] is a popular Lithuanian sausage added to the list of EU's [[Protected Designation of Origin|Protected Designations of Origin]]. The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania - the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. Skilandis was smoked in a special room - ''kaminas'' which was used for cooking.\n\n==Fish==\n\nFreshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]] or [[perch]], are often baked whole or stuffed. [[Herring]] is marinated, baked, fried, or served in [[aspic]].

Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; [[curd cheese]] (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. Lithuanian butter and cream is unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on.

Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.\n*Birthdays - The family's favorite cake is served. Traditionally in Lithuania the day of the saint after whom one was named was celebrated by the family as well as one's own birth date; for instance, a John would celebrate his name day on St. John's Day ([[Jonin\u0117s]]), June 23.\n*Christmas Eve ([[K\u016b\u010dios]]) - Twelve dishes are presented on a table spread with hay and lit by candles. No animal products, including dairy products or eggs, can be consumed as part of this meal. However, fish is permitted and regularly forms part of the meal. This custom is widespread in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Eastern Europe]], but traditions vary to different families. It is supposed that rituals and servicing of the Christmas Eve table reflect the most ancient Lithuanian traditions.\n*Weddings - The widest possible variety of courses are served. A special bread is sometimes baked and adorned with flowers and bird-shaped decorations, or a [[\u0161akotis]] is decorated. The ideal Lithuanian wedding lasts at least two days, so a great deal of cooking and baking goes on.\n*Funerals - The bereaved family usually hosts a dinner for all the mourners at a restaurant or other similar venue.\n*Informal gatherings and cocktail parties - The hosts often serve small open-face sandwiches, similar to those at a Scandinavian [[smorgasbord]], topped with smoked fish, sausage, cucumbers, and so forth.

Several Lithuanian beers have won international awards. Local breweries are enjoying a renaissance. Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage. Lithuania has a long farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles. Beer was brewed for ancient Baltic [[Festival|festivities]] and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|website=www.llti.lt|page=18|title=Alus \u2013 apeiginis balt\u0173 g\u0117rimas|accessdate=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808021048/http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was ''Ragutis'' or ''R\u016bgutis''. Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.\n\nFarmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/lithuanian-beer-guide/book.pdf|website=www.garshol.priv.no|page=5|title=Lithuanian beer - A rough guide|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersofeurope.org/uploads/mycms-files/documents/publications/2016/stats_2016_web.pdf|website=www.brewersofeurope.org|title=Beer statistics - 2016 edition|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.\n\n===Midus===\n\n''[[Midus]]'' is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of [[mead]] made from honey.

There is also a carbonated soft drink known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.\n*''Degtin\u0117 (\"the burn\")'' is the Lithuanian version of [[vodka]], traditionally made from rye. Produced domestically, its quality ranges from basic to triple-[[Distilled beverage|distilled]].\n*''Kava ([[coffee]])'' is brewed in [[espresso]] makers or [[Moka pot|moka pots]] at home, or with espresso machines in cafes. It is quite strong and usually sweetened. Coffeehouses (''kavin\u0117'') can be found not only on every street corner in towns but at highway rest stops and at every point of interest. First traditionally Lithuanians roasted oak acorns and made ''gili\u0173 kava'' (acorn coffee) - a substitute for natural bean coffee. The first coffeehouses appeared in Lithuania in the 18th century and in 1814 there were 49 coffeehouses in Vilnius.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Balsevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117-\u0160lekien\u0117 |first1=Virginija |title=Vilniaus kavin\u0117s istoriniuose \u0161altiniuose ir memuaruose |url=http://www.su.lt/bylos/fakultetai/humanitarinis/ml/acta/acta-h-15/slekiene.pdf |accessdate=2 May 2019 |language=LT |format=PDF}}</ref> Journalist Rapolas Mackonis was explorer of cafe life and wrote about culture of cafes in Vilnius and Kaunas. \n*''[[Starka]]'', an aged vodka, as well as [[Krupnikas]], a honey liqueur, are traditional drinks dating from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 16th - 18th centuries.\n*''[[Bitters|Trauktin\u0117]]'' (a bitter) is a strong herbal vodka; there are many varieties.
