A variation on it as a method of cleansing and relaxation became popular during the [[Victorian era]], and then spread through the [[British Empire]] and [[Western Europe]]. The buildings are similar to Roman ''[[thermae]]''.  Unlike Russian saunas (''[[banya (sauna)|banya]]''), which use steam, Turkish baths focus on water.\n\nThe particular bathing process roughly parallels [[ancient Roman bathing]] practices. It starts with relaxation in a room heated by a continuous flow of hot, dry air, allowing the bather to perspire freely. Bathers may then move to an even hotter room before they wash in cold water. After performing a full body wash and receiving a [[massage]], bathers finally retire to the cooling-room for a period of relaxation.<ref>\"Hammam\" by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Jahan-i Tibb, Volume 7, Number 1, July\u2013September 2005, Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine, [[Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy]], pages 12\u201317.</ref>\n\nUnlike a hammam, Victorian Turkish baths use hot, dry air; in the Islamic hammam the air is often steamy. The bather in a Victorian Ottoman bath will often take a plunge in a cold pool after the hot rooms; the Islamic hammam usually does not have a pool unless the water is flowing from a spring. In the Islamic hammams, the bathers splash themselves with cold water.\n\nThe Victorian Turkish bath was described by [[Johann Ludwig Wilhelm Thudichum]]<ref>\"The Turkish bath\" by [[J L W Thudichum]], Transactions of the Royal Medical Society, 1861, page 40.</ref> in a lecture to the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] given in 1861, one year after the first such bath was opened in London:\n\n{{quote|The discovery that was lost and has been found again, is this, in the fewest possible words: The application of hot air to the human body.

It is customary before praying to perform [[Ritual purification|ablutions]]. The two Islamic forms of ablution are ''[[ghusl]]'', a full-body cleansing, and ''[[wudu]]'', a cleansing of the face, hands, and feet.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rahim|first=Habibeh|title=Understanding Islam|journal=The Furrow|year=2001|volume=52|issue=12|pages=670\u2013674}}</ref>  In the absence of water, cleansing with pure soil or sand is also permissible.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reinhart|first=Kevin|title=Impurity/No Danger|journal=History of Religions|year=1990|volume=30|issue=1|pages=1\u201324|doi=10.1086/463212}}</ref>  Mosques always provide a place to wash, but often hammams are located nearby for those who wish to perform deeper cleansing.<ref name=\"Sibley\">{{cite journal|last=Sibley|first=Magda|title=The Historic Hammams of Damascus and Fez: Lessons of Sustainability and Future Developments|journal=The 23rd Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture}}</ref>\n\nHammams, particularly in Morocco, evolved from their Roman roots to adapt to the needs of ritual purification according to Islam. For example, in most Roman-style hammams, one finds a cold pool for full submersion of the body. The style of bathing is less preferable in the Islamic faith, which finds bathing under running water without being fully submerged more appropriate.<ref name=\"Sibley\"/>\n\n[[Al-Ghazali]], a prominent Muslim theologian writing in the 11th century, wrote ''Revival of the Religious Sciences'', a multi-volume work on dissecting the proper forms of conduct for many aspects of Muslim life and death. One of the volumes, entitled ''The Mysteries of Purity'', details the proper technique for performing ablutions before prayer and great ablutions after physical activities deemed unclean, such as sex or defecation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Abu Hammid|title=The Mysteries of Purity: Being a Translation with Notes of the Kit\u0101b Asr\u0101r Al-\u1e6dah\u0101rah of Al-Ghazz\u0101li's I\u1e25y\u0101\u02bc \u02bbul\u016bm Al-d\u012bn|year=1975|publisher=Muhammad Ashraf|location=Lahore}}</ref> For al-Ghazali, the hammam is a primarily male experience, and he cautions that women are to enter the hammam only after childbirth or illness. Even then al-Gazali finds it admissible for men to prohibit their wives or sisters from using the hammam. The major point of contention surrounding hammams in al-Ghazali's estimation is nakedness. In his work he warns that overt nakedness is to be avoided. \"\u2026 he should shield it from the sight of others and second, guard against the touch of others.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Abu Hammid|title=The Mysteries of Purity: Being a Translation with Notes of the Kit\u0101b Asr\u0101r Al-\u1e6dah\u0101rah of Al-Ghazz\u0101li's I\u1e25y\u0101\u02bc \u02bbul\u016bm Al-d\u012bn|year=1975|publisher=Muhammad Ashraf|location=Lahore|page=51}}</ref>  He focuses extensively in his writing on the avoidance of touching the penis during bathing and after urination. He writes that nakedness is decent only when the area between the knees and the lower stomach of a man are hidden. For women, exposure of only the face and palms is appropriate. According to al-Gazali, the prevalence of nakedness in the hammam could incite indecent thoughts or behaviours and so it is a controversial space.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bouhdiba|first=Abdelwahab|title=Sexuality in Islam|year=1985|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|page=62}}</ref> Ritual ablution is also required before or after sexual intercourse.<ref name=\"Joseph 2003\">{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=Suad|title=Encyclopedia of Women & Islamic Cultures|year=2003|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|authorlink=Space: Hammam|author2=Afsaneh Najmabadi }}</ref> Knowing that, [[May Telmissany]], a professor at the University of Ottawa, argues that the image of a hyper-sexualised woman leaving the hammam is an [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] perspective that sees leaving or attending the hammam as a sign of pre-eminent sexual behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nkrumah|first=Gamal|title=Tales from the Hammam|newspaper=Al-Ahram Weekly|date=23 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumbnail|Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres: ''[[The Turkish Bath]]'', 1862 ([[Louvre]], Paris)]]\n\n== Social function: gendered social space ==\nArab hammams are gendered spaces where being a woman or a man can make someone included or a representative of the \"other\" respectively. Therefore, they represent a very special departure from the public sphere in which one is physically exposed amongst other women or men. This declaration of sexuality merely by being nude makes hammams a site of gendered expression. One exception to this gender segregation is the presence of young boys who often accompany their mothers until they grow old enough to necessitate attending the male hammam with their fathers.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Kilito| first=Abdelfettah|author2=Patricia Geesey |title=Architecture and the Sacred: A Season in the Hamam|journal=Research in African Literatures|year=1992|volume=23|issue=2|pages=203\u2013208}}</ref> The separation from the women\u2019s hammam and entrance to the male hammam usually occurs at the age of 5 or 6.<ref name=\"Joseph 2003\"/>\n\nAs a primarily female space, women's hammams play a special role in society. Valerie Staats finds that the women's hammams of Morocco serve as a social space where traditional and modern women from urban and rural areas of the country come together, regardless of their religiosity, to bathe and socialise.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Staats|first=Valerie|title=Ritual, Strategy, or Convention: Social Meanings in the Traditional Women's Baths in Morocco|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|year=1994|volume=14|issue=3|pages=1\u201318|doi=10.2307/3346678|jstor=3346678}}</ref> While al-Ghazali and other Islamic intellectuals may have stipulated certain regulations for bathing, the regulations, being outdated and fundamental, are not usually upheld in the everyday interactions of Moroccans in the hammam.

During those centuries of war, peace, alliance, trade and competition, the several cultures (Eastern Roman,  Islamic Persian and Turkic ) had tremendous influence on each other. Moving beyond the reuse of the Greek  and Roman baths (for example [[Byzantine Bath (Thessaloniki)]]), new bath were constructed as [[mosque#Ablution facilities|annex buildings of mosques]], the complexes of which were community centres as well as houses of worship.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] became prolific patrons of baths, building a number of ambitious structures, particularly in Constantinople, whose Greek inhabitants had retained a strong Eastern Roman bath culture (see [[Baths of Zeuxippus]]).<ref>[http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/Islahammam.htm Hamams in Islamic tradition (cyberbohemia.com)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814082956/http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/Islahammam.htm |date=14 August 2004 }}</ref> The monumental baths designed by Renaissance Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]] (1489\u20131588), such as the [[\u00c7emberlita\u015f Hamam\u0131]], the bath in the complex of the [[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]], and the bath of the [[Selimiye Mosque, Edirne|Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]] were particularly influential.\n\nLike its Roman predecessor, a typical hamam consists of three basic, interconnected rooms: the ''s\u0131cakl\u0131k'' (or ''hararet'' \u2013 in Latin, [[caldarium]]), which is the hot room; the warm room ([[tepidarium]]), which is the intermediate room; and the ''so\u011fukluk'', which is the cool room ([[frigidarium]]). The main evolutionary change between Roman baths and Turkish baths concerned the cool room. The Roman ''frigidarium'' included a quite cold water pool in which patrons would immerse themselves before moving on to the warmer rooms. Medieval Muslim customs put a high priority on cleanliness but preferred running water to immersion baths, so the cold water pool was dispensed with. Also, the sequence of rooms was revised so that people generally used the cool room after the warmer rooms and massages, rather than before. Whereas the Romans used it as preparation, the Ottomans used it for refreshment (drinks and snacks are served) and recovery.\n\nThe ''s\u0131cakl\u0131k'' usually has a large dome decorated with small glass [[clerestory]] windows that create a half-light; in the center of the room is a large heated marble table (''g\u00f6bek ta\u015f\u0131'' or navel stone) that the customers lie on, and niches with fountains in the corners. This room is for soaking up steam and getting scrub massages. The warm room is used for washing with soap and water and the ''so\u011fukluk'' is to relax, dress, have a refreshing drink, sometimes tea, and, where available, a nap in a private cubicle after the massage. A few of the hamams in [[Istanbul]] also contain ''[[mikveh]]''s, ritual cleansing baths for Jewish women.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nThe hamam, like its precursors, is not exclusive to men. Hamam complexes usually contain separate quarters for men and women; or males and females are admitted at separate times. Because they were social centers as well as baths, hamams became numerous during the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and were built in almost every Ottoman city. On many occasions they became places of entertainment (such as dancing and food, especially in the women's quarters) and ceremonies, such as before weddings, high-holidays, celebrating newborns, beauty trips.\n\nSeveral accessories from Roman times survive in modern hamams, such as the ''[[peshtamal|pe\u015ftemal]]'' (a special cloth of silk and/or cotton to cover the body, like a [[pareo]]), ''nal\u0131n'' (wooden [[clogs]] that prevent slipping on the wet floor, or mother-of-pearl), ''kese'' (a rough mitt for massage), and sometimes jewel boxes, gilded soap boxes, mirrors, [[henna]] bowls and perfume bottles. \n\nTraditionally, the masseurs in the baths, ''tellak'' in Turkish, were young men who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. After the defeat and dismemberment of the Ottoman army in the early 20th century, the role of tellak boys was filled by adult attendants.<ref>{{harv|Yilmazkaya|Deniz|2005}} discusses occasional licentious activity</ref>\n\n==Famous examples==\n[[File:\u0130stanbul - Ayasofya H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131 r2 - \u015eub 2013.JPG|thumb|The [[Haseki H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131]] ordered by [[Roxelana]] and constructed by [[Mimar Sinan]] in [[Istanbul]]]]\n\n===Arab world===\n==== Morocco ====\nThe ruins of the oldest known Islamic hammam in Morocco, dating back to the late 8th century, can be found in [[Volubilis]]. Public baths in Morocco are embedded into a social-cultural history that has played a significant role in both urban and rural Moroccan cities. These public spaces for cleansing grew rapidly as Islamic cultures assimilated to the bathing techniques widely used during the Roman and Byzantine periods.<ref name=\"Sibley\"/> The structure of Islamic hammams in the Arab world varies from that of what has been termed the traditional \u201c[[Roman bath]].\u201d Additionally, since Morocco (unlike Egypt or Syria) was never under Ottoman rule, its baths are not technically Turkish although guide books might refer to them as such. This misnomer can be due in part to the Arabic use of the word hammam, which translates to \u201cbathroom\u201d or \u201cpublic bath place\u201d and can be used to refer to all baths, including those in the Turkish and Roman design.\n\nHammams in Morocco are often close to mosques to facilitate the performance of ablutions. Because of their private nature (overt nudity and gender separation), their entrances are often discreet and the building's fa\u00e7ade is typically windowless. Vestiges of Roman bathing styles can be seen in the manifestation of the three-room structure, which was widespread during the Roman/Byzantine period.\n\nIn Morocco, hammams are typically smaller than Roman/Byzantine baths. While it may be difficult to identify a hammam from the face of the structure, the hammam roof betrays itself with its series of characteristic domes that indicate chambers in the building.<ref name=\"Sibley 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Sibley|first=Magda|author2=Fodil Fadli |title=Hammams in North Africa: An Architectural Study of Sustainability Concepts in a Historical Traditional Building|journal=26th Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture|year=2009}}</ref> Hammams often occupy irregularly shaped plots to fit them seamlessly into the city\u2019s design. They are significant sites of culture and socialisation as they are integrated into medina, or city, life in proximity to mosques, madrassas (schools) and aswaq (markets). Magda Sibley, an expert on Islamic public baths writes that second to mosques, many specialists in Islamic architecture and urbanism find the hammam to be the most significant building in Islamic medinas.<ref name=\"Sibley 2009\"/>\n\n====Syria====\nAn old legendary story says that [[Damascus]] once had 365 hammams or \"Turkish baths\", one for each day of the year. For centuries, hammams were an integral part of community life, with some 50 hammams surviving in Damascus until the 1950s. {{As of|2012}}, however, with the growth of modernisation programmes and home bathrooms, fewer than 20 Damascene working hamams had survived.<ref>[http://garnetpublishing.co.uk/book/hammaming-sham ''Hammaming in the Sham: A Journey through the Turkish Baths of Damascus, Aleppo and Beyond''], Richard Boggs, Garnet Publishing Ltd.</ref> According to many historians, the northern city of [[Aleppo]] was home to 177 hammams during the medieval period until the Mongol invasion when many vital structures in the city were destroyed.

Nowadays, roughly 18 hammams are operating in the [[Ancient City of Aleppo|Ancient part of the city]].<ref>[http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/index.php?p=stories&category=round&filename=200808202135011 Alepo hammams]</ref>\n*[[Hammam al-Sultan]] built in 1211 by [[Az-Zahir Ghazi]].\n*[[Hammam al-Nahhaseen]] built during the 12th century near Khan al-Nahhaseen.\n*[[Hammam al-Bayadah]] of the Mamluk era built in 1450.\n*[[Hammam Yalbugha]] built in 1491 by the [[List of rulers of Aleppo|Emir of Aleppo]] Saif ad-Din Yalbugha al-Naseri.<ref>{{cite book |title=Syria & Lebanon |last1= Carter|first1= Terry|last2=Dunston |first2=Lara |last3= Humphreys|first3= Andrew|year=2004 |publisher=Lonely Planet |location= |isbn=978-1-86450-333-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781864503333/page/186 186] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781864503333 |url-access=registration |quote=Hammam yalbougha. |accessdate=}}</ref>\n*Hammam al-Jawhary, Gammam Azdemir, Hammam Bahram Pasha, Hammam Bab al-Ahmar, etc.\n\n====Egypt====\n[[Egypt]] was part of the Ottoman Empire, and the hamams of [[Cairo]] and other major cities like [[Alexandria]] are evidence of the unique Ottoman legacy. There used to be as many as 300 hamams in Cairo. {{As of|2012}}, only seven remain. Two of them, located in the El Hussien and [[Khan el-Khalili]] districts are closed.\n\n===Turkey===\nThere are many historical hammams in Istanbul. ''[[A\u011fa hamam\u0131]]'', built in 1454, is on Turnac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 Street near [[Taksim Square]]. The ''[[Haseki H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131]]'' or ''Ayasofya Haseki Hamam\u0131'' was commissioned by Suleiman I's consort, H\u00fcrrem Sultan, and constructed by Mimar Sinan during the 16th century. It was built on the site of the historical [[Baths of Zeuxippus]] for the religious community of the nearby [[Hagia Sophia]]. [[S\u00fcleymaniye Hamam]] is situated on a hill facing the [[Golden Horn]]. It was built in 1557 by Mimar Sinan; it was named after S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent. It is part of the complex of the [[Suleymaniye Mosque]]. ''[[\u00c7emberlita\u015f Hamam\u0131]]'' on Divanyolu Street in the \u00c7emberlita\u015f neighbourhood was constructed by Mimar Sinan in 1584. The Ca\u011falo\u011flu Hamam, finished in 1741, is the last hamam to be built in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nOutside the capital, ''Tarihi Karata\u015f Ho\u015fg\u00f6r Hamam\u0131'', built in 1855, is on Karata\u015f in the [[Konak, Izmir|Konak]] neighbourhood of [[Izmir]]. \n\n===Greece and Cyprus===\n[[File:Nicosia 01-2017 img11 Omeriye Hammam.jpg|thumb|[[Hamam Omerye Baths]], Nicosia, Cyprus]]\n\n[[File: Pasha Hamam, Thessaloniki.JPG|thumb|Pasha Hamam, Thessaloniki, Greece]]\n\nIn [[Thessaloniki]], [[Bey Hamam]] was built in 1444 by sultan [[Murad II]]. It is a double bath, for men and women. The baths remained in use, under the name \"Baths of Paradise\", until 1968. Pasha Hamam was built in 1520\u20131530, during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], and operated until 1981 under the name \"Fenix Baths\". Restored, it now houses archeological findings from construction on the Thessaloniki metro. \n\nThe [[Hamam Omerye Baths]] in [[Nicosia]] date to the 14th century. Built as an [[Augustinian]] church of St. Mary of stone, with small domes, they date to the Frankish and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] period, like the city walls. In 1571, the ruler Mustafa Bilal Geldosh Pasha converted the church into a mosque, believing that it was where the Khalifa [[Umar]] rested during his visit to Lefkosia.

Turkish baths were introduced by [[David Urquhart]], diplomat and sometime [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Stafford]], who for political and personal reasons wished to popularise [[Turkish culture]]. In 1850, he wrote ''The Pillars of Hercules'', a book about his travels in 1848 through Spain and Morocco. He described the system of dry hot-air baths used there and in the [[Ottoman Empire]], which had changed little since [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]]. In 1856, [[Richard Barter]] read Urquhart's book and worked with him to construct a bath. Although this was not a success, Barter persevered and later that year opened the first modern Turkish bath at St Ann's Hydropathic Establishment near [[Blarney]], [[County Cork]], Ireland.<ref name=\"ShifrinStAnnsIreland\">{{Citation| last=Shifrin| first=Malcolm | title=St Ann's Hydropathic Establishment, Blarney, Co.

It reached London in July 1860, when Roger Evans, a member of one of Urquhart's Foreign Affairs Committees, opened a Turkish bath at 5 Bell Street, near [[Marble Arch]].\n\nDuring the following 150 years, over 600 Turkish baths opened in the country, including those built by municipal authorities as part of swimming pool complexes, taking advantage of the fact that water-heating boilers were already on site.\n\nSimilar baths opened in other parts of the British Empire. Dr. [[John Le Gay Brereton]], who had given medical advice to bathers in a Foreign Affairs Committee-owned Turkish bath in [[Bradford]], travelled to [[Sydney]], Australia, and opened a Turkish bath there on Spring Street in 1859, even before such baths had reached London.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shifrin|first=Malcolm|title=Victorian Turkish Baths|year=2015|publisher=Historic England|location=London|pages=51\u20132}}</ref>  Canada had one by 1869, and the first in New Zealand was opened in 1874.\n\nUrquhart's influence was also felt outside the Empire when in 1861, Dr Charles H Shepard opened the first Turkish baths in the United States at 63 Columbia Street, [[Brooklyn Heights]], New York City, most probably on 3 October 1863.<ref>''[[The Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]'', 3 October 1863</ref> Before that, the United States, like many other places, had several Russian baths, one of the first being that opened in 1861 by M.

A variation on it as a method of cleansing and relaxation became popular during the [[Victorian era]], and then spread through the [[British Empire]] and [[Western Europe]]. The buildings are similar to Roman ''[[thermae]]''.  Unlike Russian saunas (''[[banya (sauna)|banya]]''), which use steam, Turkish baths focus on water.\n\nThe particular bathing process roughly parallels [[ancient Roman bathing]] practices. It starts with relaxation in a room heated by a continuous flow of hot, dry air, allowing the bather to perspire freely. Bathers may then move to an even hotter room before they wash in cold water. After performing a full body wash and receiving a [[massage]], bathers finally retire to the cooling-room for a period of relaxation.<ref>\"Hammam\" by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Jahan-i Tibb, Volume 7, Number 1, July\u2013September 2005, Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine, [[Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy]], pages 12\u201317.</ref>\n\nUnlike a hammam, Victorian Turkish baths use hot, dry air; in the Islamic hammam the air is often steamy. The bather in a Victorian Ottoman bath will often take a plunge in a cold pool after the hot rooms; the Islamic hammam usually does not have a pool unless the water is flowing from a spring. In the Islamic hammams, the bathers splash themselves with cold water.\n\nThe Victorian Turkish bath was described by [[Johann Ludwig Wilhelm Thudichum]]<ref>\"The Turkish bath\" by [[J L W Thudichum]], Transactions of the Royal Medical Society, 1861, page 40.</ref> in a lecture to the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] given in 1861, one year after the first such bath was opened in London:\n\n{{quote|The discovery that was lost and has been found again, is this, in the fewest possible words: The application of hot air to the human body.

It is customary before praying to perform [[Ritual purification|ablutions]]. The two Islamic forms of ablution are ''[[ghusl]]'', a full-body cleansing, and ''[[wudu]]'', a cleansing of the face, hands, and feet.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rahim|first=Habibeh|title=Understanding Islam|journal=The Furrow|year=2001|volume=52|issue=12|pages=670\u2013674}}</ref>  In the absence of water, cleansing with pure soil or sand is also permissible.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reinhart|first=Kevin|title=Impurity/No Danger|journal=History of Religions|year=1990|volume=30|issue=1|pages=1\u201324|doi=10.1086/463212}}</ref>  Mosques always provide a place to wash, but often hammams are located nearby for those who wish to perform deeper cleansing.<ref name=\"Sibley\">{{cite journal|last=Sibley|first=Magda|title=The Historic Hammams of Damascus and Fez: Lessons of Sustainability and Future Developments|journal=The 23rd Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture}}</ref>\n\nHammams, particularly in Morocco, evolved from their Roman roots to adapt to the needs of ritual purification according to Islam. For example, in most Roman-style hammams, one finds a cold pool for full submersion of the body. The style of bathing is less preferable in the Islamic faith, which finds bathing under running water without being fully submerged more appropriate.<ref name=\"Sibley\"/>\n\n[[Al-Ghazali]], a prominent Muslim theologian writing in the 11th century, wrote ''Revival of the Religious Sciences'', a multi-volume work on dissecting the proper forms of conduct for many aspects of Muslim life and death. One of the volumes, entitled ''The Mysteries of Purity'', details the proper technique for performing ablutions before prayer and great ablutions after physical activities deemed unclean, such as sex or defecation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Abu Hammid|title=The Mysteries of Purity: Being a Translation with Notes of the Kit\u0101b Asr\u0101r Al-\u1e6dah\u0101rah of Al-Ghazz\u0101li's I\u1e25y\u0101\u02bc \u02bbul\u016bm Al-d\u012bn|year=1975|publisher=Muhammad Ashraf|location=Lahore}}</ref> For al-Ghazali, the hammam is a primarily male experience, and he cautions that women are to enter the hammam only after childbirth or illness. Even then al-Gazali finds it admissible for men to prohibit their wives or sisters from using the hammam. The major point of contention surrounding hammams in al-Ghazali's estimation is nakedness. In his work he warns that overt nakedness is to be avoided. \"\u2026 he should shield it from the sight of others and second, guard against the touch of others.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Abu Hammid|title=The Mysteries of Purity: Being a Translation with Notes of the Kit\u0101b Asr\u0101r Al-\u1e6dah\u0101rah of Al-Ghazz\u0101li's I\u1e25y\u0101\u02bc \u02bbul\u016bm Al-d\u012bn|year=1975|publisher=Muhammad Ashraf|location=Lahore|page=51}}</ref>  He focuses extensively in his writing on the avoidance of touching the penis during bathing and after urination. He writes that nakedness is decent only when the area between the knees and the lower stomach of a man are hidden. For women, exposure of only the face and palms is appropriate. According to al-Gazali, the prevalence of nakedness in the hammam could incite indecent thoughts or behaviours and so it is a controversial space.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bouhdiba|first=Abdelwahab|title=Sexuality in Islam|year=1985|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|page=62}}</ref> Ritual ablution is also required before or after sexual intercourse.<ref name=\"Joseph 2003\">{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=Suad|title=Encyclopedia of Women & Islamic Cultures|year=2003|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|authorlink=Space: Hammam|author2=Afsaneh Najmabadi }}</ref> Knowing that, [[May Telmissany]], a professor at the University of Ottawa, argues that the image of a hyper-sexualised woman leaving the hammam is an [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] perspective that sees leaving or attending the hammam as a sign of pre-eminent sexual behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nkrumah|first=Gamal|title=Tales from the Hammam|newspaper=Al-Ahram Weekly|date=23 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumbnail|Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres: ''[[The Turkish Bath]]'', 1862 ([[Louvre]], Paris)]]\n\n== Social function: gendered social space ==\nArab hammams are gendered spaces where being a woman or a man can make someone included or a representative of the \"other\" respectively. Therefore, they represent a very special departure from the public sphere in which one is physically exposed amongst other women or men. This declaration of sexuality merely by being nude makes hammams a site of gendered expression. One exception to this gender segregation is the presence of young boys who often accompany their mothers until they grow old enough to necessitate attending the male hammam with their fathers.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Kilito| first=Abdelfettah|author2=Patricia Geesey |title=Architecture and the Sacred: A Season in the Hamam|journal=Research in African Literatures|year=1992|volume=23|issue=2|pages=203\u2013208}}</ref> The separation from the women\u2019s hammam and entrance to the male hammam usually occurs at the age of 5 or 6.<ref name=\"Joseph 2003\"/>\n\nAs a primarily female space, women's hammams play a special role in society.

During those centuries of war, peace, alliance, trade and competition, the several cultures (Eastern Roman,  Islamic Persian and Turkic ) had tremendous influence on each other. Moving beyond the reuse of the Greek  and Roman baths (for example [[Byzantine Bath (Thessaloniki)]]), new bath were constructed as [[mosque#Ablution facilities|annex buildings of mosques]], the complexes of which were community centres as well as houses of worship.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] became prolific patrons of baths, building a number of ambitious structures, particularly in Constantinople, whose Greek inhabitants had retained a strong Eastern Roman bath culture (see [[Baths of Zeuxippus]]).<ref>[http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/Islahammam.htm Hamams in Islamic tradition (cyberbohemia.com)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814082956/http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/Islahammam.htm |date=14 August 2004 }}</ref> The monumental baths designed by Renaissance Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]] (1489\u20131588), such as the [[\u00c7emberlita\u015f Hamam\u0131]], the bath in the complex of the [[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]], and the bath of the [[Selimiye Mosque, Edirne|Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]] were particularly influential.\n\nLike its Roman predecessor, a typical hamam consists of three basic, interconnected rooms: the ''s\u0131cakl\u0131k'' (or ''hararet'' - in Latin, [[caldarium]]), which is the hot room; the warm room ([[tepidarium]]), which is the intermediate room; and the ''so\u011fukluk'', which is the cool room ([[frigidarium]]). The main evolutionary change between Roman baths and Turkish baths concerned the cool room. The Roman ''frigidarium'' included a quite cold water pool in which patrons would immerse themselves before moving on to the warmer rooms. Medieval Muslim customs put a high priority on cleanliness but preferred running water to immersion baths, so the cold water pool was dispensed with. Also, the sequence of rooms was revised so that people generally used the cool room after the warmer rooms and massages, rather than before. Whereas the Romans used it as preparation, the Ottomans used it for refreshment (drinks and snacks are served) and recovery.\n\nThe ''s\u0131cakl\u0131k'' usually has a large dome decorated with small glass [[clerestory]] windows that create a half-light; in the center of the room is a large heated marble table (''g\u00f6bek ta\u015f\u0131'' or navel stone) that the customers lie on, and niches with fountains in the corners. This room is for soaking up steam and getting scrub massages. The warm room is used for washing with soap and water and the ''so\u011fukluk'' is to relax, dress, have a refreshing drink, sometimes tea, and, where available, a nap in a private cubicle after the massage. A few of the hamams in [[Istanbul]] also contain ''[[mikveh]]''s, ritual cleansing baths for Jewish women.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nThe hamam, like its precursors, is not exclusive to men. Hamam complexes usually contain separate quarters for men and women; or males and females are admitted at separate times. Because they were social centers as well as baths, hamams became numerous during the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and were built in almost every Ottoman city. On many occasions they became places of entertainment (such as dancing and food, especially in the women's quarters) and ceremonies, such as before weddings, high-holidays, celebrating newborns, beauty trips.\n\nSeveral accessories from Roman times survive in modern hamams, such as the ''[[peshtamal|pe\u015ftemal]]'' (a special cloth of silk and/or cotton to cover the body, like a [[pareo]]), ''nal\u0131n'' (wooden [[clogs]] that prevent slipping on the wet floor, or mother-of-pearl), ''kese'' (a rough mitt for massage), and sometimes jewel boxes, gilded soap boxes, mirrors, [[henna]] bowls and perfume bottles. \n\nTraditionally, the masseurs in the baths, ''tellak'' in Turkish, were young men who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. After the defeat and dismemberment of the Ottoman army in the early 20th century, the role of tellak boys was filled by adult attendants.<ref>{{harv|Yilmazkaya|Deniz|2005}} discusses occasional licentious activity</ref>\n\n==Famous examples==\n[[File:\u0130stanbul - Ayasofya H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131 r2 - \u015eub 2013.JPG|thumb|The [[Haseki H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131]] ordered by [[Roxelana]] and constructed by [[Mimar Sinan]] in [[Istanbul]]]]\n\n===Arab world===\n==== Morocco ====\nThe ruins of the oldest known Islamic hammam in Morocco, dating back to the late 8th century, can be found in [[Volubilis]]. Public baths in Morocco are embedded into a social-cultural history that has played a significant role in both urban and rural Moroccan cities. These public spaces for cleansing grew rapidly as Islamic cultures assimilated to the bathing techniques widely used during the Roman and Byzantine periods.<ref name=\"Sibley\"/> The structure of Islamic hammams in the Arab world varies from that of what has been termed the traditional \u201c[[Roman bath]].\u201d Additionally, since Morocco (unlike Egypt or Syria) was never under Ottoman rule, its baths are not technically Turkish although guide books might refer to them as such. This misnomer can be due in part to the Arabic use of the word hammam, which translates to \u201cbathroom\u201d or \u201cpublic bath place\u201d and can be used to refer to all baths, including those in the Turkish and Roman design.\n\nHammams in Morocco are often close to mosques to facilitate the performance of ablutions. Because of their private nature (overt nudity and gender separation), their entrances are often discreet and the building's fa\u00e7ade is typically windowless. Vestiges of Roman bathing styles can be seen in the manifestation of the three-room structure, which was widespread during the Roman/Byzantine period.\n\nIn Morocco, hammams are typically smaller than Roman/Byzantine baths. While it may be difficult to identify a hammam from the face of the structure, the hammam roof betrays itself with its series of characteristic domes that indicate chambers in the building.<ref name=\"Sibley 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Sibley|first=Magda|author2=Fodil Fadli |title=Hammams in North Africa: An Architectural Study of Sustainability Concepts in a Historical Traditional Building|journal=26th Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture|year=2009}}</ref> Hammams often occupy irregularly shaped plots to fit them seamlessly into the city\u2019s design. They are significant sites of culture and socialisation as they are integrated into medina, or city, life in proximity to mosques, madrassas (schools) and aswaq (markets). Magda Sibley, an expert on Islamic public baths writes that second to mosques, many specialists in Islamic architecture and urbanism find the hammam to be the most significant building in Islamic medinas.<ref name=\"Sibley 2009\"/>\n\n====Syria====\nAn old legendary story says that [[Damascus]] once had 365 hammams or \"Turkish baths\", one for each day of the year. For centuries, hammams were an integral part of community life, with some 50 hammams surviving in Damascus until the 1950s. {{As of|2012}}, however, with the growth of modernisation programmes and home bathrooms, fewer than 20 Damascene working hamams had survived.<ref>[http://garnetpublishing.co.uk/book/hammaming-sham ''Hammaming in the Sham: A Journey through the Turkish Baths of Damascus, Aleppo and Beyond''], Richard Boggs, Garnet Publishing Ltd.</ref> According to many historians, the northern city of [[Aleppo]] was home to 177 hammams during the medieval period until the Mongol invasion when many vital structures in the city were destroyed. Until 1970, around 40 hammams were still operating in the city. Nowadays, roughly 18 hammams are operating in the [[Ancient City of Aleppo|Ancient part of the city]].<ref>[http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/index.php?p=stories&category=round&filename=200808202135011 Alepo hammams]</ref>\n*[[Hammam al-Sultan]] built in 1211 by [[Az-Zahir Ghazi]].\n*[[Hammam al-Nahhaseen]] built during the 12th century near Khan al-Nahhaseen.\n*[[Hammam al-Bayadah]] of the Mamluk era built in 1450.\n*[[Hammam Yalbugha]] built in 1491 by the [[List of rulers of Aleppo|Emir of Aleppo]] Saif ad-Din Yalbugha al-Naseri.<ref>{{cite book |title=Syria & Lebanon |last1= Carter|first1= Terry|last2=Dunston |first2=Lara |last3= Humphreys|first3= Andrew|year=2004 |publisher=Lonely Planet |location= |isbn=978-1-86450-333-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781864503333/page/186 186] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781864503333 |url-access=registration |quote=Hammam yalbougha. |accessdate=}}</ref>\n*Hammam al-Jawhary, Gammam Azdemir, Hammam Bahram Pasha, Hammam Bab al-Ahmar, etc.\n\n====Egypt====\n[[Egypt]] was part of the Ottoman Empire, and the hamams of [[Cairo]] and other major cities like [[Alexandria]] are evidence of the unique Ottoman legacy. There used to be as many as 300 hamams in Cairo. {{As of|2012}}, only seven remain. Two of them, located in the El Hussien and [[Khan el-Khalili]] districts are closed.\n\n===Turkey===\nThere are many historical hammams in Istanbul. ''[[A\u011fa hamam\u0131]]'', built in 1454, is on Turnac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 Street near [[Taksim Square]]. The ''[[Haseki H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131]]'' or ''Ayasofya Haseki Hamam\u0131'' was commissioned by Suleiman I's consort, H\u00fcrrem Sultan, and constructed by Mimar Sinan during the 16th century. It was built on the site of the historical [[Baths of Zeuxippus]] for the religious community of the nearby [[Hagia Sophia]]. [[S\u00fcleymaniye Hamam]] is situated on a hill facing the [[Golden Horn]]. It was built in 1557 by Mimar Sinan; it was named after S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent. It is part of the complex of the [[Suleymaniye Mosque]]. ''[[\u00c7emberlita\u015f Hamam\u0131]]'' on Divanyolu Street in the \u00c7emberlita\u015f neighbourhood was constructed by Mimar Sinan in 1584. The Ca\u011falo\u011flu Hamam, finished in 1741, is the last hamam to be built in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nOutside the capital, ''Tarihi Karata\u015f Ho\u015fg\u00f6r Hamam\u0131'', built in 1855, is on Karata\u015f in the [[Konak, Izmir|Konak]] neighbourhood of [[Izmir]]. \n\n===Greece and Cyprus===\n[[File:Nicosia 01-2017 img11 Omeriye Hammam.jpg|thumb|[[Hamam Omerye Baths]], Nicosia, Cyprus]]\n\n[[File: Pasha Hamam, Thessaloniki.JPG|thumb|Pasha Hamam, Thessaloniki, Greece]]\n\nIn [[Thessaloniki]], [[Bey Hamam]] was built in 1444 by sultan [[Murad II]]. It is a double bath, for men and women. The baths remained in use, under the name \"Baths of Paradise\", until 1968. Pasha Hamam was built in 1520-1530, during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], and operated until 1981 under the name \"Fenix Baths\". Restored, it now houses archeological findings from construction on the Thessaloniki metro. \n\nThe [[Hamam Omerye Baths]] in [[Nicosia]] date to the 14th century. Built as an [[Augustinian]] church of St. Mary of stone, with small domes, they date to the Frankish and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] period, like the city walls. In 1571, the ruler Mustafa Bilal Geldosh Pasha converted the church into a mosque, believing that it was where the Khalifa [[Umar]] rested during his visit to Lefkosia. Most of the building was destroyed by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] artillery although the door of the main entrance belongs to the 14th century Lusignan building, and remains of a later [[Renaissance]] phase can be seen at the north-eastern side of the monument. In 2003, the [EU] funded a bi-communal UNDP/UNOPS project, \"Partnership for the Future\", in collaboration with Nicosia Municipality and Nicosia Master Plan. The [[B\u00fcy\u00fck Hammam]] dates to the 14th century.\n\n[[Image:Torok furdo Budapest Ganz utca PB010341-lev-1000.jpg|thumb|Kir\u00e1ly Baths building on Ganz Street, Budapest]]\n\n===Hungary===\n[[Budapest]], the [[Spas in Budapest|City of Spas]] has four working Turkish baths, all from the 16th century and open to the public: [[Rudas Baths]], [[Kir\u00e1ly Baths]], [[R\u00e1cz Thermal Bath]], and Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r Spa Bath (reopened to the public since December 2012).\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Hammam Al-Nahhasseen Aleppo.jpg|[[Hammam al-Nahhasin]] in [[Aleppo]], 12th&nbsp;century\nFile:Aleppo Citadel 16 - Hammam.jpg|Hammam at the [[Citadel of Aleppo]], {{circa|1200}}\nFile:THES-Bey Hamam hot chamber 3.jpg|Hamam hot chamber in the [[Bey Hamam]] in [[Thessaloniki]], built 1444\nFile:Banys arabs3.jpg|Room at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ba\u00f1os del Almirante|es|3=Ba\u00f1os del Almirante}} in [[Valencia]], {{circa|1320}}\nFile:Hurrem Sultan Hamam Interior .png|''[[Haseki H\u00fcrrem Sultan Hamam\u0131]]'', 16th&nbsp;century\nFile:SamannudHammamSpring.jpg|Fountain in the Ibrahim Sirag el-Din hammam, [[Sebennytos|Samann\u016bd]], Egypt\nFile:Turkish Bath, interior 07 dome.JPG|Turkish Bath, interior\nFile:Divan Asia Istanbul Hamam 1140041.jpg|Istanbul, a hotel hamam\n</gallery>\n\n===India===\n[[Delhi]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Bhopal]] have multiple working Turkish Baths, which were started during the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] period in the early 16th century.<ref name=\"siasat\">{{cite news| title=Turkish bath centre defunct at Nizamia general hospital| url=http://www.siasat.com/english/news/turkish-bath-centre-defunct-nizamia-general-hospital| publisher=siasat.com| date=11 January 2012| accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Where are those Turkish baths?| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-06-11/delhi/27164199_1_intach-haveli-indian-national-trust| newspaper=The Times of India| date=11 June 2004| accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Centre keen on hammam| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-27/bhopal/30446875_1_steam-chamber-bath| newspaper=The Times of India| date=27 November 2011| accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Hyderabad Attractions| url=http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/asia/india/hyderabad/33213/golconda-fort/attraction-detail.html| newspaper=The New York Times| date=12 January 2012| accessdate=12 January 2012| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120043953/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/asia/india/hyderabad/33213/golconda-fort/attraction-detail.html| archivedate=20 November 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Syed Zillur Rahman, Hammam \u2013 Past and Present, Newsletter of Ibn Sina Academy 2012, Volume 12 No 1: 10-16</ref> Two prominent examples include the [[Hammam-e-Qadimi]] and [[Hammam (Red Fort)|Hammam-e-Lal Qila]].<ref name=\"Gianani2016\">{{cite web|url=http://www.natgeotraveller.in/bhopals-300-year-old-hidden-hammam/|title=Bhopal's 300-Year-Old Hidden Hammam|last=Gianani|first=Kareena|date=22 June 2016|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|language=English|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Pakistan===\n[[Lahore]]'s [[Shahi Hammam]] or Royal Bath House, located in the [[Walled City of Lahore]], is one of the best preserved examples of a [[Mughal era]] Hamam.

Turkish baths were introduced by [[David Urquhart]], diplomat and sometime [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Stafford]], who for political and personal reasons wished to popularise [[Turkish culture]]. In 1850, he wrote ''The Pillars of Hercules'', a book about his travels in 1848 through Spain and Morocco. He described the system of dry hot-air baths used there and in the [[Ottoman Empire]], which had changed little since [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]]. In 1856, [[Richard Barter]] read Urquhart's book and worked with him to construct a bath. Although this was not a success, Barter persevered and later that year opened the first modern Turkish bath at St Ann's Hydropathic Establishment near [[Blarney]], [[County Cork]], Ireland.<ref name=\"ShifrinStAnnsIreland\">{{Citation| last=Shifrin| first=Malcolm | title=St Ann's Hydropathic Establishment, Blarney, Co.

It reached London in July 1860, when Roger Evans, a member of one of Urquhart's Foreign Affairs Committees, opened a Turkish bath at 5 Bell Street, near [[Marble Arch]].\n\nDuring the following 150 years, over 600 Turkish baths opened in the country, including those built by municipal authorities as part of swimming pool complexes, taking advantage of the fact that water-heating boilers were already on site.\n\nSimilar baths opened in other parts of the British Empire. Dr. [[John Le Gay Brereton]], who had given medical advice to bathers in a Foreign Affairs Committee-owned Turkish bath in [[Bradford]], travelled to [[Sydney]], Australia, and opened a Turkish bath there on Spring Street in 1859, even before such baths had reached London.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shifrin|first=Malcolm|title=Victorian Turkish Baths|year=2015|publisher=Historic England|location=London|pages=51\u20132}}</ref>  Canada had one by 1869, and the first in New Zealand was opened in 1874.\n\nUrquhart's influence was also felt outside the Empire when in 1861, Dr Charles H Shepard opened the first Turkish baths in the United States at 63 Columbia Street, [[Brooklyn Heights]], New York City, most probably on 3 October 1863.<ref>''[[The Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]'', 3 October 1863</ref> Before that, the United States, like many other places, had several Russian baths, one of the first being that opened in 1861 by M.

Established by the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], the ECB is one of the world's [[Big Four (banking)#International use|most important central banks]] and serves as one of seven [[institutions of the European Union]], being enshrined in the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU). The bank's capital stock is owned by all 27 central banks of each EU member state.<ref name=\"capital\" /> The current [[President of the European Central Bank|President of the ECB]] is [[Christine Lagarde]].

Its basic tasks, set out in Article 3 of the Statute,<ref name=ecbst/> are to set and implement the [[monetary policy]] for the Eurozone, to conduct foreign exchange operations, to take care of the [[foreign reserve]]s of the [[European System of Central Banks]] and operation of the financial market infrastructure under the [[TARGET2]] payments system and the technical platform (currently being developed) for settlement of securities in Europe ([[TARGET2 Securities]]). The ECB has, under Article 16 of its Statute,<ref name=ecbst/> the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of [[euro banknotes]]. Member states can issue [[euro coins]], but the amount must be authorised by the ECB beforehand.\n\nThe ECB is governed by European law directly, but its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital. Its capital is \u20ac11 billion held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders.<ref name=\"capital\"/> The initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the states' population and GDP, but the capital key has been adjusted.<ref name=\"capital\"/> Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|History of the euro}}\n[[File:Wim Duisenberg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|[[Wim Duisenberg]], first President of the ECB]]\nThe European Central Bank is the ''de facto'' successor of the [[European Monetary Institute]] (EMI).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/history/emu/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Economic and Monetary Union|publisher=ECB |accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> The EMI was established at the start of the second stage of the EU's [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] (EMU) to handle the transitional issues of states adopting the euro and prepare for the creation of the ECB and [[European System of Central Banks]] (ESCB).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>  The EMI itself took over from the earlier [[European Monetary Co-operation Fund]] (EMCF).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |title=European Central Bank |publisher=CVCE |url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/european_central_bank-en-fc8d2e17-cbde-4ec8-8f79-46f06c471540.html |accessdate=18 February 2014|date=2016-08-07 }}</ref>\n\nThe ECB formally replaced the EMI on 1 June 1998 by virtue of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU, Treaty of Maastricht), however it did not exercise its full powers until the [[introduction of the euro]] on 1 January 1999, signalling the third stage of EMU.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The bank was the final institution needed for EMU, as outlined by the EMU reports of [[Pierre Werner]] and [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Jacques Delors]].

First, because the ECB's legal framework normally forbids the purchase of sovereign bonds (Article 123. TFEU),<ref>Bagus, ''The Tragedy of the Euro'', 2010, p.75.</ref> This prevented the ECB from implementing [[quantitative easing]] like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England did as soon as 2008, which played an important role in stabilizing markets. Secondly, a decision by the ECB made in 2005 introduced a minimum credit rating (BBB-) for all Eurozone sovereign bonds to be eligible as collateral to the ECB's open market operations. This meant that if a private rating agencies were to downgrade a sovereign bond below that threshold, many banks would suddenly become illiquid because they would lose access to ECB refinancing operations. According to former member of the governing council of the ECB [[Athanasios Orphanides]], this change in the ECB's collateral framework \"planted the seed\" of the euro crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/how-ecb-planted-seeds-euro-area-crisis|title=Monetary policy and fiscal discipline: How the ECB planted the seeds of the euro area crisis|last=Orphanides|first=Athanasios|date=2018-03-09|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref>\n\nFaced with those regulatory constraints, the ECB led by Jean-Claude Trichet in 2010 was reluctant to intervene to calm down financial markets.

Instead, the governments issued a 31bn EUR \"promissory note\" (an IOU) to Anglo \u2013 which it had nationalized. In turn, the bank supplied the promissory note as collateral to the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] as collateral, so it could access emergency liquidity assistance (ELA). This way, Anglo was able to repay its bondholders. The operation became very controversial, as it basically shifted Anglo's private debts onto the government's balance sheet.\n\nIt became clear later that the ECB played a key role in making sure the Irish Government did not let Anglo default on its debts, in order to avoid a financial instability risks.

In essence, they forced European banks, and, more importantly, the European Central Bank itself (e.g. when gauging the [[solvency]] of financial institutions) to rely more than ever on standardised assessments of [[credit risk]] marketed by two non-European private agencies: Moody's and S&P.\n\n===Difference with US Federal Reserve===\nIn the United States, the [[Federal Reserve System]] purchases Treasury securities in order to inject liquidity into the economy. The [[Eurosystem]], on the other hand, uses a different method. There are about 1,500 eligible banks which may bid for short-term [[repurchase agreement|repo contracts]] of two weeks to three months duration.<ref>In practice, 400\u2013500 banks participate regularly. <br />{{citation|author=Samuel Cheun|title=The collateral frameworks of the Eurosystem, the Federal Reserve System and the Bank of England and the financial market turmoil|date=December 2009|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp107.pdf|publisher=ECB|accessdate=24 August 2011|author2=Isabel von K\u00f6ppen-Mertes|author3=Benedict Weller}}</ref>\n\nThe banks in effect borrow cash and must pay it back; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually. When the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again. An increase in the quantity of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy. A decrease has the contrary effect. The contracts are carried on the asset side of the European Central Bank's balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability. In layman terms, the liability of the central bank is money, and an increase in deposits in member banks, carried as a liability by the central bank, means that more money has been put into the economy.{{efn|The process is similar, though on a grand scale, to an individual who every month charges $10,000 on his or her credit card, pays it off every month, but also withdraws (and pays off) an additional $10,000 each succeeding month for transaction purposes. Such a person is operating \"net borrowed\" on a continual basis, and even though the borrowing from the credit card is short term, the effect is a stable increase in the money supply. If the person borrows less, less money circulates in the economy. If he or she borrows more, the money supply increases. An individual's ability to borrow from his or her credit card company is determined by the credit card company: it reflects the company's overall judgment of its ability to lend to all borrowers, and also its appraisal of the financial condition of that one particular borrower.

The ECB's governing council deliberates with a high degree of secrecy, since individual voting records are not disclosed to the public (leading to suspicions that Governing Council members are voting along national lines.<ref>Friedrich Heinemann and Felix Huefner (2004) 'Is the view from the Eurotower purely European? National divergence and ECB interest rate policy', ''Scottish Journal of Political Economy'' 51(4):544-558.</ref><ref>Jose Ramon Cancelo, Diego Varela and Jose Manuel Sanchez-Santos (2011) 'Interest rate setting at the ECB: Individual preferences and collective decision making', ''Journal of Policy Modeling'' 33(6): 804-820. [[doi:10.1016/j.jpolmod.2011.08.017|DOI]].</ref>) In addition to monetary policy decisions, the ECB has the right to issue legally binding regulations, within its competence and if the conditions laid down in Union law are fulfilled, it can sanction non-compliant actors if they violate legal requirements laid down in directly applicable Union regulations. The ECB's own legal personality also allows the ECB to enter into international legal agreements independently from other EU institutions, and be party of legal proceedings. Finally, the ECB can organise its internal structure as it sees fit. \n* '''Personal independence:''' the mandate of ECB board members is purposefully very long (8 years) and Governors of national central banks have a minimum renewable term of office of five years.<ref name=\"Independence\" /> In addition, ECB board members and are vastly immune from judicial proceedings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp4.pdf?581a2ecf674a6554f5af698f5bf54019|title=PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK|last=|first=|date=2007|website=European Central Bank|access-date=}}</ref> Indeed, removals from office can only be decided by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] (CJEU), under the request of the ECB's Governing Council or the Executive Board (i.e. the ECB itself). Such decision is only possible in the event of incapacity or serious misconduct. National governors of the Eurosystem' national central banks can be dismissed under national law (with possibility to appeal) in case they can no longer fulfil their functions or are guilty of serious misconduct.\n* '''Financial independence''': the ECB is the only body within the EU whose statute guarantees budgetary independence through its own resources and income. The ECB uses its own profits generated by its monetary policy operations and cannot be technically insolvent. The ECB's financial independence reinforces its political independence. Because the ECB does not require external financing and symmetrically is prohibited from direct financing to public institutions, this shields it from potential pressure from public authorities.\n*'''Political independence''': The Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the member states may not seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the NCBs in the performance of their tasks. Symmetrically, EU institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ECB's independence. It is the latter which is the subject of much debate.\n\n==== Debates on ECB independance ====\n\n===== The arguments in favour of this independence =====\nThe debate on the independence of the ECB has its origins in the preparatory stages of the construction of the EMU. The German government agreed to go ahead if certain crucial guarantees were respected, such as a European Central Bank independent of national governments and shielded from political pressure along the lines of the German central bank. The French government, for its part, feared that this independence would mean that politicians would no longer have any room for manoeuvre in the process. A compromise was then reached by establishing a regular dialogue between the ECB and the Council of Finance Ministers of the euro area, the Eurogroupe.\n\nThe founding model of the ECB, as advocated by the German government, is explained in an article published in 1983 by two economists, Robert Barro and David Gordon.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barro|first=Robert|last2=Gordon|first2=David|date=February 1983|title=Rules, Discretion and Reputation in a Model of Monetary Policy|location=Cambridge, MA|doi=10.3386/w1079}}</ref> According to them, the best way to combat the inflationary bias is for central banks to be credible. This credibility would be all the more important if the central banks were independent, so that decisions are not \"contaminated\" by politics. For economists, central banks should then have only one objective: to maintain a low inflation rate. For this system to work, it would then be necessary to assume that a monetary policy conducted in this way would have no effect on the real economy.\n\nSince that publication, it has often been accepted that an independent institution to manage monetary policy can help to limit chronic inflation. This model was generalised in various variations at the national levels before being adopted at the European level.<ref name=\"Barbier-Gauchard, Am\u00e9lie 1978-....\">{{Cite book|last=Barbier-Gauchard, Am\u00e9lie (1978-....).|title=La gouvernance \u00e9conomique de la zone euro : r\u00e9alit\u00e9s et perspectives|others=Sidiropoulos, Mo\u00efse., Varoudakis, Aristom\u00e8ne (1958-....)., De Grauwe, Paul (1946-....).|date=15 May 2018|isbn=978-2-8073-2010-9|location=Louvain-la-Neuve|oclc=1041143371}}</ref>\n\nThe original European project, as intended by the founding fathers, did not attract the passions and favours of the European peoples.

It is difficult, if not impossible, for them to conceive of a democratisation of the ECB by attaching to it a share of political control in its operation without distorting the \"European Project\", this bible, this unique political reason which has guided professionals in Europe for generations.\n\nIn this same idea, we can find in the \"European Project\" the Kantian tradition with a model of successful subordination of political power to the law, leading to what Habermas calls \"the civilising force of democratic legalification\". This Habermatian theory leads us once again to isolate supranational institutions from political games. Indeed, for Habermas, European politics, like national politics for that matter, finds it impossible to define ONE uniform people, but at best a pluriform people in constant opposition, each component against the other. For this author, popular sovereignty is illusory, as is the concept of \"government by the people\". He prefers the search for a broad consensus legitimized by the majority of democratically elected representatives of the people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dialogues avec J\u00fcrgen Habermas|others=Aubert, Isabelle, 1979-, Kerv\u00e9gan, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|isbn=978-2-271-11596-6|location=Paris|oclc=1065711045}}</ref> This explains his attachment to deflecting the influence of popular emotions from technical institutions, such as the ECB.\n\n===== The arguments against too much independence =====\n\n====== An independence that would be the source of a democratic deficit. ======\n'''Demystify the independence of central bankers''' :According to Christopher Adolph (2009),<ref name=\"Adolph, Christopher, 1976\u20132013\">{{Cite book|last=Adolph, Christopher, 1976-|title=Bankers, bureaucrats, and central bank politics : the myth of neutrality|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-61681-2|location=New York|oclc=844940155}}</ref> the alleged neutrality of central bankers is only a legal fa\u00e7ade and not an indisputable fact .

Indeed, the Euro is an overvalued currency on the world markets against the dollar and the Euro zone is at risk of deflation. In addition, Member States find themselves heavily indebted, partly due to the rescue of their national banks. The ECB, as the guardian of the stability of the euro zone, is deciding to gradually buy back more than EUR 1 100 billion Member States' public debt. In this way, money is injected back into the economy, the euro depreciates significantly, prices rise, the risk of deflation is removed, and Member States reduce their debts. However, the ECB has just given itself the right to direct the exchange rate policy of the euro zone without this being granted by the Treaties or with the approval of European leaders, and without public opinion or the public arena being aware of this.<ref name=\"Delaume 2015 75\"/>\n\nIn conclusion, for those in favour of a framework for ECB independence, there is a clear concentration of powers.

For the German economist German Issing (2001) the ECB as a democratic responsibility and should be more transparent.

The ECB has, under Article 16 of its Statute,<ref name=ecbst/> the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of [[euro banknotes]]. Member states can issue [[euro coins]], but the amount must be authorised by the ECB beforehand.\n\nThe ECB is governed by European law directly, but its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital. Its capital is \u20ac11 billion held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders.<ref name=\"capital\"/> The initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the states' population and GDP, but the capital key has been adjusted.<ref name=\"capital\"/> Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|History of the euro}}\n[[File:Wim Duisenberg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|[[Wim Duisenberg]], first President of the ECB]]\nThe European Central Bank is the ''de facto'' successor of the [[European Monetary Institute]] (EMI).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/history/emu/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Economic and Monetary Union|publisher=ECB |accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> The EMI was established at the start of the second stage of the EU's [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] (EMU) to handle the transitional issues of states adopting the euro and prepare for the creation of the ECB and [[European System of Central Banks]] (ESCB).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>  The EMI itself took over from the earlier [[European Monetary Co-operation Fund]] (EMCF).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |title=European Central Bank |publisher=CVCE |url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/european_central_bank-en-fc8d2e17-cbde-4ec8-8f79-46f06c471540.html |accessdate=18 February 2014|date=2016-08-07 }}</ref>\n\nThe ECB formally replaced the EMI on 1 June 1998 by virtue of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU, Treaty of Maastricht), however it did not exercise its full powers until the [[introduction of the euro]] on 1 January 1999, signalling the third stage of EMU.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The bank was the final institution needed for EMU, as outlined by the EMU reports of [[Pierre Werner]] and [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Jacques Delors]].

First, because the ECB's legal framework normally forbids the purchase of sovereign bonds (Article 123. TFEU),<ref>Bagus, ''The Tragedy of the Euro'', 2010, p.75.</ref> This prevented the ECB from implementing [[quantitative easing]] like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England did as soon as 2008, which played an important role in stabilizing markets. Secondly, a decision by the ECB made in 2005 introduced a minimum credit rating (BBB-) for all Eurozone sovereign bonds to be eligible as collateral to the ECB's open market operations. This meant that if a private rating agencies were to downgrade a sovereign bond below that threshold, many banks would suddenly become illiquid because they would lose access to ECB refinancing operations. According to former member of the governing council of the ECB [[Athanasios Orphanides]], this change in the ECB's collateral framework \"planted the seed\" of the euro crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/how-ecb-planted-seeds-euro-area-crisis|title=Monetary policy and fiscal discipline: How the ECB planted the seeds of the euro area crisis|last=Orphanides|first=Athanasios|date=2018-03-09|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref>\n\nFaced with those regulatory constraints, the ECB led by Jean-Claude Trichet in 2010 was reluctant to intervene to calm down financial markets.

Extraordinarily, the decision was taken by the Governing Council during a teleconference call only three days after the ECB's usual meeting of May 6 (when Trichet still denied the possibility of purchasing sovereign bonds). The ECB justified this decision by the necessity to \"address severe tensions in financial markets.\" The decision also coincided with the EU leaders decision of May 10 to establish the European Financial Stabilisation mechanism, which would serve as a crisis fighting fund to safeguard the euro area from future sovereign debt crisis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/30048|title=Mixed support for ECB bond purchases|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe's ECB bond buying focused primarily on Spanish and Italian debt.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=McManus |first2=Dan |last2=O'Brien |title=Market rout as Berlin rejects call for more EU action |journal=Irish Times |date=5 August 2011 }}</ref> They were intended to dampen international speculation against those countries, and thus avoid a contagion of the Greek crisis towards other Eurozone countries.

Instead, the governments issued a 31bn EUR \"promissory note\" (an IOU) to Anglo \u2013 which it had nationalized. In turn, the bank supplied the promissory note as collateral to the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] as collateral, so it could access emergency liquidity assistance (ELA). This way, Anglo was able to repay its bondholders. The operation became very controversial, as it basically shifted Anglo's private debts onto the government's balance sheet.\n\nIt became clear later that the ECB played a key role in making sure the Irish Government did not let Anglo default on its debts, in order to avoid a financial instability risks.

The [[Eurosystem]], on the other hand, uses a different method. There are about 1,500 eligible banks which may bid for short-term [[repurchase agreement|repo contracts]] of two weeks to three months duration.<ref>In practice, 400\u2013500 banks participate regularly. <br />{{citation|author=Samuel Cheun|title=The collateral frameworks of the Eurosystem, the Federal Reserve System and the Bank of England and the financial market turmoil|date=December 2009|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp107.pdf|publisher=ECB|accessdate=24 August 2011|author2=Isabel von K\u00f6ppen-Mertes|author3=Benedict Weller}}</ref>\n\nThe banks in effect borrow cash and must pay it back; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually. When the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again. An increase in the quantity of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy. A decrease has the contrary effect. The contracts are carried on the asset side of the European Central Bank's balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability. In layman terms, the liability of the central bank is money, and an increase in deposits in member banks, carried as a liability by the central bank, means that more money has been put into the economy.{{efn|The process is similar, though on a grand scale, to an individual who every month charges $10,000 on his or her credit card, pays it off every month, but also withdraws (and pays off) an additional $10,000 each succeeding month for transaction purposes. Such a person is operating \"net borrowed\" on a continual basis, and even though the borrowing from the credit card is short term, the effect is a stable increase in the money supply. If the person borrows less, less money circulates in the economy. If he or she borrows more, the money supply increases. An individual's ability to borrow from his or her credit card company is determined by the credit card company: it reflects the company's overall judgment of its ability to lend to all borrowers, and also its appraisal of the financial condition of that one particular borrower. The ability of member banks to borrow from the central bank is fundamentally similar.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} }}\n\nTo qualify for participation in the auctions, banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities.

The ECB's governing council deliberates with a high degree of secrecy, since individual voting records are not disclosed to the public (leading to suspicions that Governing Council members are voting along national lines.<ref>Friedrich Heinemann and Felix Huefner (2004) 'Is the view from the Eurotower purely European? National divergence and ECB interest rate policy', ''Scottish Journal of Political Economy'' 51(4):544-558.</ref><ref>Jose Ramon Cancelo, Diego Varela and Jose Manuel Sanchez-Santos (2011) 'Interest rate setting at the ECB: Individual preferences and collective decision making', ''Journal of Policy Modeling'' 33(6): 804-820. [[doi:10.1016/j.jpolmod.2011.08.017|DOI]].</ref>) In addition to monetary policy decisions, the ECB has the right to issue legally binding regulations, within its competence and if the conditions laid down in Union law are fulfilled, it can sanction non-compliant actors if they violate legal requirements laid down in directly applicable Union regulations. The ECB's own legal personality also allows the ECB to enter into international legal agreements independently from other EU institutions, and be party of legal proceedings. Finally, the ECB can organise its internal structure as it sees fit. \n* '''Personal independence:''' the mandate of ECB board members is purposefully very long (8 years) and Governors of national central banks have a minimum renewable term of office of five years.<ref name=\"Independence\" /> In addition, ECB board members and are vastly immune from judicial proceedings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp4.pdf?581a2ecf674a6554f5af698f5bf54019|title=PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK|last=|first=|date=2007|website=European Central Bank|access-date=}}</ref> Indeed, removals from office can only be decided by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] (CJEU), under the request of the ECB's Governing Council or the Executive Board (i.e. the ECB itself). Such decision is only possible in the event of incapacity or serious misconduct. National governors of the Eurosystem' national central banks can be dismissed under national law (with possibility to appeal) in case they can no longer fulfil their functions or are guilty of serious misconduct.\n* '''Financial independence''': the ECB is the only body within the EU whose statute guarantees budgetary independence through its own resources and income. The ECB uses its own profits generated by its monetary policy operations and cannot be technically insolvent. The ECB's financial independence reinforces its political independence. Because the ECB does not require external financing and symmetrically is prohibited from direct financing to public institutions, this shields it from potential pressure from public authorities.\n*'''Political independence''': The Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the member states may not seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the NCBs in the performance of their tasks. Symmetrically, EU institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ECB's independence. It is the latter which is the subject of much debate.\n\n==== Debates on ECB independance ====\n\n===== The arguments in favour of this independence =====\nThe debate on the independence of the ECB has its origins in the preparatory stages of the construction of the EMU. The German government agreed to go ahead if certain crucial guarantees were respected, such as a European Central Bank independent of national governments and shielded from political pressure along the lines of the German central bank. The French government, for its part, feared that this independence would mean that politicians would no longer have any room for manoeuvre in the process. A compromise was then reached by establishing a regular dialogue between the ECB and the Council of Finance Ministers of the euro area, the Eurogroupe.\n\nThe founding model of the ECB, as advocated by the German government, is explained in an article published in 1983 by two economists, Robert Barro and David Gordon.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barro|first=Robert|last2=Gordon|first2=David|date=February 1983|title=Rules, Discretion and Reputation in a Model of Monetary Policy|location=Cambridge, MA|doi=10.3386/w1079}}</ref> According to them, the best way to combat the inflationary bias is for central banks to be credible. This credibility would be all the more important if the central banks were independent, so that decisions are not \"contaminated\" by politics. For economists, central banks should then have only one objective: to maintain a low inflation rate. For this system to work, it would then be necessary to assume that a monetary policy conducted in this way would have no effect on the real economy.\n\nSince that publication, it has often been accepted that an independent institution to manage monetary policy can help to limit chronic inflation. This model was generalised in various variations at the national levels before being adopted at the European level.<ref name=\"Barbier-Gauchard, Am\u00e9lie 1978-....\">{{Cite book|last=Barbier-Gauchard, Am\u00e9lie (1978-....).|title=La gouvernance \u00e9conomique de la zone euro : r\u00e9alit\u00e9s et perspectives|others=Sidiropoulos, Mo\u00efse., Varoudakis, Aristom\u00e8ne (1958-....)., De Grauwe, Paul (1946-....).|date=15 May 2018|isbn=978-2-8073-2010-9|location=Louvain-la-Neuve|oclc=1041143371}}</ref>\n\nThe original European project, as intended by the founding fathers, did not attract the passions and favours of the European peoples.

It is difficult, if not impossible, for them to conceive of a democratisation of the ECB by attaching to it a share of political control in its operation without distorting the \"European Project\", this bible, this unique political reason which has guided professionals in Europe for generations.\n\nIn this same idea, we can find in the \"European Project\" the Kantian tradition with a model of successful subordination of political power to the law, leading to what Habermas calls \"the civilising force of democratic legalification\". This Habermatian theory leads us once again to isolate supranational institutions from political games. Indeed, for Habermas, European politics, like national politics for that matter, finds it impossible to define ONE uniform people, but at best a pluriform people in constant opposition, each component against the other. For this author, popular sovereignty is illusory, as is the concept of \"government by the people\". He prefers the search for a broad consensus legitimized by the majority of democratically elected representatives of the people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dialogues avec J\u00fcrgen Habermas|others=Aubert, Isabelle, 1979-, Kerv\u00e9gan, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|isbn=978-2-271-11596-6|location=Paris|oclc=1065711045}}</ref> This explains his attachment to deflecting the influence of popular emotions from technical institutions, such as the ECB.\n\n===== The arguments against too much independence =====\n\n====== An independence that would be the source of a democratic deficit. ======\n'''Demystify the independence of central bankers''' :According to Christopher Adolph (2009),<ref name=\"Adolph, Christopher, 1976\u20132013\">{{Cite book|last=Adolph, Christopher, 1976-|title=Bankers, bureaucrats, and central bank politics : the myth of neutrality|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-61681-2|location=New York|oclc=844940155}}</ref> the alleged neutrality of central bankers is only a legal fa\u00e7ade and not an indisputable fact .

Indeed, the Euro is an overvalued currency on the world markets against the dollar and the Euro zone is at risk of deflation. In addition, Member States find themselves heavily indebted, partly due to the rescue of their national banks. The ECB, as the guardian of the stability of the euro zone, is deciding to gradually buy back more than EUR 1 100 billion Member States' public debt. In this way, money is injected back into the economy, the euro depreciates significantly, prices rise, the risk of deflation is removed, and Member States reduce their debts. However, the ECB has just given itself the right to direct the exchange rate policy of the euro zone without this being granted by the Treaties or with the approval of European leaders, and without public opinion or the public arena being aware of this.<ref name=\"Delaume 2015 75\"/>\n\nIn conclusion, for those in favour of a framework for ECB independence, there is a clear concentration of powers. In the light of these facts, it is clear that the ECB is no longer the simple guardian of monetary stability in the euro area, but has become, over the course of the crisis, a \"''multi-competent economic player, at ease in this role that no one, especially not the agnostic governments of the euro Member States, seems to have the idea of challenging''\".<ref name=\"Delaume 2015 75\"/> This new political super-actor, having captured many spheres of competence and a very strong influence in the economic field in the broad sense (economy, finance, budget...).\u00a0 This new political super-actor can no longer act alone and refuse a counter-power, consubstantial to our liberal democracies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=B\u00e9land|first=Daniel|date=May 2010|title=The Idea of Power and the Role of Ideas|journal=Political Studies Review|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=145\u2013154|doi=10.1111/j.1478-9302.2009.00199.x|issn=1478-9299}}</ref> Indeed, the status of independence which the ECB enjoys by essence should not exempt it from a real responsibility regarding the democratic process.\n\n====== The arguments in favour of a counter power ======\nIn the aftermath of the euro area crisis, several proposals for a countervailing power were put forward, to deal with criticisms of a democratic deficit. For the German economist German Issing (2001) the ECB as a democratic responsibility and should be more transparent. According to him, this transparence could bring several advantages as the improvement of the efficiency and of the credibility by giving to the public adequate information.

But I think I\u2019ve found evidence in some of the early sources that seems to show that [[Muhammad]] made things better for women. It appears that in some parts of Arabia, notably in [[Mecca]], a [[matrilineal]] system was in the process of being replaced by a [[patrilineal]] one at the time of Muhammad. Growing prosperity caused by a shifting of [[trade route]]s was accompanied by a growth in [[individualism]]. Men were amassing considerable personal wealth and wanted to be sure that this would be inherited by their own actual sons, and not simply by an extended family of their sisters\u2019 sons. This led to a deterioration in the rights of women. At the time [[Islam]] began, the conditions of women were terrible - they had no right to own property, were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons. Muhammad improved things quite a lot. By instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, he gave women certain basic safeguards. Set in such historical context the Prophet can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women's rights. <sup><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alastairmcintosh.com/articles/2000_watt.htm|title=Interview with Prof William Montgomery Watt|website=www.alastairmcintosh.com|accessdate=20 June 2017}}</ref></sup></blockquote>\n\n===Early reforms===\n{{main|Early reforms under Islam}}\n\nDuring the [[early reforms under Islam]] in the 7th century, reforms in [[women's rights]] affected marriage, divorce and inheritance.<ref name=\"Espos\">Esposito (2005) p. 79</ref> Lindsay Jones says that women were not accorded with such legal status in other cultures, including the West, until centuries later.<ref>Jones, Lindsay. p.6224</ref> ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' states that the general improvement of the status of Arab women included prohibition of [[female infanticide]] and recognizing women's full personhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510?_hi=2&_pos=2%5D|title=Women and Islam - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|accessdate=20 June 2017}}</ref> \"The [[dowry]], previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property.\"<ref name=\"Espos\"/><ref name=\"majid\">Khadduri (1978)</ref> Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a \"status\" but rather as a \"[[contract]]\", in which the woman's consent was imperative.<ref name=\"Espos\"/><ref name=\"majid\"/><ref name=\"OxfordDicT\">Esposito (2004), p. 339</ref> \"Women were given inheritance rights in a [[patriarchal society]] that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives.\"<ref name=\"Espos\"/> [[Annemarie Schimmel]] states that \"compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work.\"<ref name = \"Schimmel\">Schimmel (1992) p.65</ref> [[William Montgomery Watt]] states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of [[women's rights]] and improved things considerably.

Firstly, the socio-economic environment discourages women from working despite encouraging them to get an education, especially in oil-rich Gulf nations. Oil and oil-related revenues perpetuate patriarchal family structures because the state itself is the \u201cpatriarch\u201d of its citizens, employing them and providing them with ready income. This means citizens don\u2019t have to look for ways to make money outside of state patronage, and may just reinforce already existing conservative gender roles where women stay at home. Oil and oil-related revenues also structure the economy away from female-intensive sectors. Secondly, patriarchal state institution systems often means weak, dependent private sectors that don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t afford to assume the cost of women\u2019s reproductive roles. This seriously hinders women's practical and logistical participation in the labor force. Thirdly, the inhospitable business environment in the private sector discourages women to work. No Arab country has a legal quota for the percentage of women it must include on corporate boards. Only Morocco and Djibouti have laws against gender discrimination in hiring and for equal remuneration for equal work. Algeria has also ruled in favor of equal pay for equal work.<ref name=\"blogs.worldbank.org\"/>\n\nWomen could contribute to the country's economy since women\u2019s employment can significantly improve household income\u2014by as much as 25 percent\u2014and lead many families out of poverty. It continues that increased household income will not only positively impact MENA economies on the micro-level, but it will bolster economies on the macro level as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=MASRI |first1=FIRAS |title=Why the Arab World should employ more women |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/02/06/why-the-arab-world-should-employ-more-women/ |website=MARKAZ |accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\n{{see also|Women's education in Saudi Arabia|Madrasah#Female education|Women's literary salons and societies in the Arab World}}The Muslim community is often criticized for not providing an equal opportunity for education for females.

But I think I\u2019ve found evidence in some of the early sources that seems to show that [[Muhammad]] made things better for women. It appears that in some parts of Arabia, notably in [[Mecca]], a [[matrilineal]] system was in the process of being replaced by a [[patrilineal]] one at the time of Muhammad. Growing prosperity caused by a shifting of [[trade route]]s was accompanied by a growth in [[individualism]]. Men were amassing considerable personal wealth and wanted to be sure that this would be inherited by their own actual sons, and not simply by an extended family of their sisters\u2019 sons. This led to a deterioration in the rights of women. At the time [[Islam]] began, the conditions of women were terrible - they had no right to own property, were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons. Muhammad improved things quite a lot. By instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, he gave women certain basic safeguards. Set in such historical context the Prophet can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women's rights. <sup><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alastairmcintosh.com/articles/2000_watt.htm|title=Interview with Prof William Montgomery Watt|website=www.alastairmcintosh.com|accessdate=20 June 2017}}</ref></sup></blockquote>\n\n===Early reforms===\n{{main|Early reforms under Islam}}\n\nDuring the [[early reforms under Islam]] in the 7th century, reforms in [[women's rights]] affected marriage, divorce and inheritance.<ref name=\"Espos\">Esposito (2005) p. 79</ref> Lindsay Jones says that women were not accorded with such legal status in other cultures, including the West, until centuries later.<ref>Jones, Lindsay. p.6224</ref> ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' states that the general improvement of the status of Arab women included prohibition of [[female infanticide]] and recognizing women's full personhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510?_hi=2&_pos=2%5D|title=Women and Islam - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|accessdate=20 June 2017}}</ref> \"The [[dowry]], previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property.\"<ref name=\"Espos\"/><ref name=\"majid\">Khadduri (1978)</ref> Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a \"status\" but rather as a \"[[contract]]\", in which the woman's consent was imperative.<ref name=\"Espos\"/><ref name=\"majid\"/><ref name=\"OxfordDicT\">Esposito (2004), p. 339</ref> \"Women were given inheritance rights in a [[patriarchal society]] that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives.\"<ref name=\"Espos\"/> [[Annemarie Schimmel]] states that \"compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work.\"<ref name = \"Schimmel\">Schimmel (1992) p.65</ref> [[William Montgomery Watt]] states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of [[women's rights]] and improved things considerably.

Firstly, the socio-economic environment discourages women from working despite encouraging them to get an education, especially in oil-rich Gulf nations. Oil and oil-related revenues perpetuate patriarchal family structures because the state itself is the \u201cpatriarch\u201d of its citizens, employing them and providing them with ready income. This means citizens don\u2019t have to look for ways to make money outside of state patronage, and may just reinforce already existing conservative gender roles where women stay at home. Oil and oil-related revenues also structure the economy away from female-intensive sectors. Secondly, patriarchal state institution systems often means weak, dependent private sectors that don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t afford to assume the cost of women\u2019s reproductive roles. This seriously hinders women's practical and logistical participation in the labor force. Thirdly, the inhospitable business environment in the private sector discourages women to work. No Arab country has a legal quota for the percentage of women it must include on corporate boards. Only Morocco and Djibouti have laws against gender discrimination in hiring and for equal remuneration for equal work. Algeria has also ruled in favor of equal pay for equal work.<ref name=\"blogs.worldbank.org\"/>\n\nWomen could contribute to the country's economy since women\u2019s employment can significantly improve household income\u2014by as much as 25 percent\u2014and lead many families out of poverty. It continues that increased household income will not only positively impact MENA economies on the micro-level, but it will bolster economies on the macro level as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=MASRI |first1=FIRAS |title=Why the Arab World should employ more women |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/02/06/why-the-arab-world-should-employ-more-women/ |website=MARKAZ |accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\n{{see also|Women's education in Saudi Arabia|Madrasah#Female education|Women's literary salons and societies in the Arab World}}The Muslim community is often criticized for not providing an equal opportunity for education for females.

The origin of these prehistoric honey bees does not necessarily indicate Europe as the place of origin of the genus, only that the bees were present in Europe by that time. Few fossil deposits are known from South Asia, the suspected region of honey bee origin, and fewer still have been thoroughly studied.\n\nNo ''Apis'' species existed in the New World during human times before the introduction of ''A. mellifera'' by Europeans.

Among the extant members of ''Apis'', the more [[basal (biology)|basal]] species make single, exposed combs, while the more recently evolved species nest in cavities and have multiple combs, which has greatly facilitated their domestication.\n\nMost species have historically been cultured or at least exploited for honey and [[beeswax]] by humans indigenous to their native ranges. Only two species have been truly [[domesticated]]: ''[[Apis mellifera]]'' and ''[[Apis cerana indica]]''. ''A. mellifera'' has been cultivated at least since the time of the building of the [[Egyptian pyramid]]s, and only that species has been moved extensively beyond its native range.\n\nHoney bees are the only extant members of the [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]] Apini.

Details vary among the different species of honey bees, but common features include:\n#Eggs are laid singly in a cell in a wax [[honeycomb]], produced and shaped by the worker bees. Using her [[spermatheca]], the queen can choose to fertilize the egg she is laying, usually depending on which cell she is laying it into. Drones develop from unfertilised eggs and are [[Ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]], while females (queens and worker bees) develop from fertilised eggs and are [[Ploidy#Diploid|diploid]]. Larvae are initially fed with [[royal jelly]] produced by worker bees, later switching to honey and pollen. The exception is a larva fed solely on royal jelly, which will develop into a queen bee. The larva undergoes several moultings before spinning a cocoon within the cell, and [[pupate|pupating]].\n#Young worker bees, sometimes called \"nurse bees\", clean the hive and feed the larvae. When their royal jelly-producing glands begin to atrophy, they begin building comb cells. They progress to other within-colony tasks as they become older, such as receiving nectar and pollen from foragers, and guarding the hive. Later still, a worker takes her first orientation flights and finally leaves the hive and typically spends the remainder of her life as a forager.\n#Worker bees cooperate to find food and use a pattern of \"dancing\" (known as the [[bee dance]] or waggle dance) to communicate information regarding resources with each other; this dance varies from species to species, but all living species of ''Apis'' exhibit some form of the behavior. If the resources are very close to the hive, they may also exhibit a less specific dance commonly known as the \"round dance\".\n#Honey bees also perform [[tremble dance]]s, which recruit receiver bees to collect nectar from returning foragers.\n#Virgin queens go on mating flights away from their home colony to a drone congregation area, and mate with multiple drones before returning. The drones die in the act of mating. Queen honey bees do not mate with drones from their home colony.\n#Colonies are established not by solitary queens, as in most bees, but by groups known as \"[[Swarming (honey bee)|swarm]]s\", which consist of a mated queen and a large contingent of worker bees. This group moves ''en masse'' to a nest site which was scouted by worker bees beforehand and whose location is communicated with a special type of dance. Once the swarm arrives, they immediately construct a new wax comb and begin to raise new worker brood. This type of nest founding is not seen in any other living bee genus, though several groups of [[vespid]] wasps also found new nests by swarming (sometimes including multiple queens). Also, [[stingless bee]]s will start new nests with large numbers of worker bees, but the nest is constructed before a queen is escorted to the site, and this worker force is not a true \"swarm\".\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Bienenwabe mit Eiern 39.jpg|Honey bee eggs shown in opened wax cells\nFile:Bienenwabe mit Eiern und Brut 5.jpg|Eggs and larvae\nFile:Drohnenpuppen 79b.jpg|Drone pupae\nFile:Birth of black bee (Apis mellifera mellifera).jpg|Emergence of a European dark honey bee (''A. m. mellifera'')\n</gallery>\n\n===Winter survival===\nIn cold climates, honey bees stop flying when the temperature drops below about {{convert|10|C|F}} and crowd into the central area of the hive to form a \"winter cluster\".

The colder the weather is outside, the more compact the cluster becomes. During winter, they consume their stored honey to produce body heat.

The scale of these pollination services is commonly measured in the billions of dollars, credited with adding about 9% to the value of crops across the world. However, despite contributing substantially to crop pollination, there is debate about the potential spillover to natural landscapes and competition between managed honey bees and many of the ~20,000 species of wild pollinators.<ref name=\"GeldmannGonz\u00e1lez-Varo2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Geldmann |first1=Jonas |last2=Gonz\u00e1lez-Varo|first2=Juan P. |title=Conserving honey bees does not help wildlife |journal=Science |volume=359 |issue=6374 |year=2018 |pages=392\u2013393 |doi=10.1126/science.aar2269|pmid=29371456 }}</ref>\n\nSpecies of ''Apis'' are generalist floral visitors, and pollinate many species of flowering plants, but because of their \"generalized\" nature, they do so inefficiently. Without specialized adaptations for specific flowers, their ability to reach pollen and nectar is often limited. What's more, their tendency to visit all species in a given area means that the pollen they carry for any one species is often very diluted. As such, they can provide some pollination to many plants, especially non-native crops, but most native plants have some native pollinator that is far more effective at pollinating that species.<ref>[https://www.decodedscience.org/plants-pollinators-and-the-price-of-almonds/28797/2 Plants, Pollinators, and the Price of Almonds]<br/>\"Flowers set more seeds when visited by wild insects, and the more plants that were visited by wild insects, the more likely they were to set fruit.

Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive. Although an increase in the number of drones would decrease the overall productivity of the hive, the reproductive fitness of the drones' mother would increase. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the [[Unit of selection|individual and group levels]] for the stability of the hive.<ref>Barron, A., Oldroyd, B, and Ratnieks, F.L.W.

The different species of honey bees are distinguished from all other bee species (and virtually all other [[Hymenoptera]]) by the possession of small barbs on the sting, but these barbs are found only in the worker bees.\n\nThe sting apparatus, including the barbs, may have evolved specifically in response to predation by vertebrates, as the barbs do not usually function (and the sting apparatus does not detach) unless the sting is embedded in fleshy tissue. While the sting can also penetrate the membranes between joints in the exoskeleton of other insects (and is used in fights between queens), in the case of ''Apis cerana japonica'', defense against larger insects such as predatory wasps (e.g. [[Asian giant hornet]]) is usually performed by surrounding the intruder with a mass of defending worker bees, which vibrate their muscles vigorously to raise the temperature of the intruder to a lethal level (\"balling\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2001/Thawley/defense.htm |title=Heat tolerance as a weapon |author=C.

[[Georg Marcgrave|Marcgrave]] indeed mentions a species of honey-bee in Brasil. But this has no sting, and is therefore different from the one we have, which resembles perfectly that of Europe. The [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] concur with us in the tradition that it was brought from Europe; but, when, and by whom, we know not. The bees have generally extended themselves into the country, a little in advance of the white settlers. The Indians therefore call them the white man's fly, and consider their approach as indicating the approach of the settlements of the whites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/bees-and-honey|title=Bees and Honey|website=www.monticello.org}}</ref>}}\n\nHoney bees have become an invasive species in the US, outcompeting native pollinators when resources are tight.<ref>[https://blog.education.nationalgeographic.org/2018/01/29/honeybees-help-farmers-but-they-dont-help-the-environment/ Honeybees Help Farmers, But They Don\u2019t Help the Environment]<br/>Are honeybees a harmful invasive species?\n* They can be, when they outcompete native bees for food. \u201cWhen flowers are abundant, there is plenty of pollen for both honeybees and their wild cousins. But in many landscapes, or when an orchard stops blooming, farmed honeybees can compete with wild bees for food, making it harder for wild species to survive.\u201d</ref>\n\nMost flowering plants depend on specialized pollinators to efficiently fertilize them. [[Cucurbitaceae|Cucurbits]], for example, are pollinated by [[squash bee]]s that specifically visit the early-blooming male flowers before sunrise, when honey bees are inactive, and then return to pollinate the female flowers later in the day. Such [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] also mean that the specialized pollinator will be covered mainly in its host's specific pollen. \n\nUnfortunately, the very generalized nature of the honey bee's nectar-gathering activities, potentially visiting dozens of different species in a single day, means that a flower visited by a honey bee will often get very little pollen from its own species. This diminished pollination can reduce the plant's ability to produce seeds, especially when the honey bees are squeezing out the native pollinators for a species, a problem occurring all over the United States because of honey bees and other invasive species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/bee-battles-why-our-native-pollinators-are-losing-the-war-40620|title=Bee battles: why our native pollinators are losing the war|first=Kelsey K.|last=Graham|website=The Conversation}}</ref><ref>[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0189268 Do managed bees have negative effects on wild bees?: A systematic review of the literature]<br/>Our review found that the majority of studies reach the conclusion that managed bees negatively affect, or have the potential to negatively affect, wild bees through competition, changes in plant communities, or transmission of pathogens.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidescience.org/news/how-bees-you-know-are-killing-bees-you-don%E2%80%99t|title=How the Bees You Know are Killing the Bees You Don't|date=January 19, 2017|website=Inside Science}}</ref>\n\n==Communication==\n{{Main|Bee learning and communication}}\nHoney bees are known to communicate through many different chemicals and odors, as is common in insects.

Details vary among the different species of honey bees, but common features include:\n#Eggs are laid singly in a cell in a wax [[honeycomb]], produced and shaped by the worker bees. Using her [[spermatheca]], the queen can choose to fertilize the egg she is laying, usually depending on which cell she is laying it into. Drones develop from unfertilised eggs and are [[Ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]], while females (queens and worker bees) develop from fertilised eggs and are [[Ploidy#Diploid|diploid]]. Larvae are initially fed with [[royal jelly]] produced by worker bees, later switching to honey and pollen. The exception is a larva fed solely on royal jelly, which will develop into a queen bee. The larva undergoes several moultings before spinning a cocoon within the cell, and [[pupate|pupating]].\n#Young worker bees, sometimes called \"nurse bees\", clean the hive and feed the larvae. When their royal jelly-producing glands begin to atrophy, they begin building comb cells. They progress to other within-colony tasks as they become older, such as receiving nectar and pollen from foragers, and guarding the hive. Later still, a worker takes her first orientation flights and finally leaves the hive and typically spends the remainder of her life as a forager.\n#Worker bees cooperate to find food and use a pattern of \"dancing\" (known as the [[bee dance]] or waggle dance) to communicate information regarding resources with each other; this dance varies from species to species, but all living species of ''Apis'' exhibit some form of the behavior. If the resources are very close to the hive, they may also exhibit a less specific dance commonly known as the \"round dance\".\n#Honey bees also perform [[tremble dance]]s, which recruit receiver bees to collect nectar from returning foragers.\n#Virgin queens go on mating flights away from their home colony to a drone congregation area, and mate with multiple drones before returning. The drones die in the act of mating. Queen honey bees do not mate with drones from their home colony.\n#Colonies are established not by solitary queens, as in most bees, but by groups known as \"[[Swarming (honey bee)|swarm]]s\", which consist of a mated queen and a large contingent of worker bees. This group moves ''en masse'' to a nest site which was scouted by worker bees beforehand and whose location is communicated with a special type of dance. Once the swarm arrives, they immediately construct a new wax comb and begin to raise new worker brood. This type of nest founding is not seen in any other living bee genus, though several groups of [[vespid]] wasps also found new nests by swarming (sometimes including multiple queens). Also, [[stingless bee]]s will start new nests with large numbers of worker bees, but the nest is constructed before a queen is escorted to the site, and this worker force is not a true \"swarm\".\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Bienenwabe mit Eiern 39.jpg|Honey bee eggs shown in opened wax cells\nFile:Bienenwabe mit Eiern und Brut 5.jpg|Eggs and larvae\nFile:Drohnenpuppen 79b.jpg|Drone pupae\nFile:Birth of black bee (Apis mellifera mellifera).jpg|Emergence of a European dark honey bee (''A. m. mellifera'')\n</gallery>\n\n===Winter survival===\nIn cold climates, honey bees stop flying when the temperature drops below about {{convert|10|C|F}} and crowd into the central area of the hive to form a \"winter cluster\".

The colder the weather is outside, the more compact the cluster becomes. During winter, they consume their stored honey to produce body heat.

The scale of these pollination services is commonly measured in the billions of dollars, credited with adding about 9% to the value of crops across the world. However, despite contributing substantially to crop pollination, there is debate about the potential spillover to natural landscapes and competition between managed honey bees and many of the ~20,000 species of wild pollinators.<ref name=\"GeldmannGonz\u00e1lez-Varo2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Geldmann |first1=Jonas |last2=Gonz\u00e1lez-Varo|first2=Juan P. |title=Conserving honey bees does not help wildlife |journal=Science |volume=359 |issue=6374 |year=2018 |pages=392\u2013393 |doi=10.1126/science.aar2269|pmid=29371456 }}</ref>\n\nSpecies of ''Apis'' are generalist floral visitors, and pollinate many species of flowering plants, but because of their \"generalized\" nature, they do so inefficiently. Without specialized adaptations for specific flowers, their ability to reach pollen and nectar is often limited. What's more, their tendency to visit all species in a given area means that the pollen they carry for any one species is often very diluted. As such, they can provide some pollination to many plants, especially non-native crops, but most native plants have some native pollinator that is far more effective at pollinating that species.<ref>[https://www.decodedscience.org/plants-pollinators-and-the-price-of-almonds/28797/2 Plants, Pollinators, and the Price of Almonds]<br/>\"Flowers set more seeds when visited by wild insects, and the more plants that were visited by wild insects, the more likely they were to set fruit.

Bees of various types other than honey bees are also domesticated and used for pollination or other means around the world, including ''[[Tetragonula iridipennis]]'' in India, the [[blue orchard bee]] for tree nut and fruit pollination in the United States, and a number of species of ''[[Bombus]]'' (bumblebees) for pollination in various regions globally, such as [[tomato]]es, which are not effectively pollinated by honey bees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biobestgroup.com/en/biobest/pollination/things-to-know-about-bumblebees-7052/species-6674/|title=Bumblebee species &#124; Biobest|website=www.biobestgroup.com}}</ref>\n\n===Colony collapse disorder===\n{{Main|Colony collapse disorder}}\n\nPrimarily in places where the bee was imported by humans, periodic collapses in honey bee populations have occurred at least since the late 19th century.<ref>[https://scholar.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1915&context=honr_theses Colony Collapse Disorder: The Vanishing Honeybee (Apis Mellifera)]<br/>However, as humans continued to manipulate the honeybee and deliberately transferred them on a global scale, diseases simultaneously spread and harmed managed colonies.

Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive. Although an increase in the number of drones would decrease the overall productivity of the hive, the reproductive fitness of the drones' mother would increase. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the [[Unit of selection|individual and group levels]] for the stability of the hive.<ref>Barron, A., Oldroyd, B, and Ratnieks, F.L.W.

The different species of honey bees are distinguished from all other bee species (and virtually all other [[Hymenoptera]]) by the possession of small barbs on the sting, but these barbs are found only in the worker bees.\n\nThe sting apparatus, including the barbs, may have evolved specifically in response to predation by vertebrates, as the barbs do not usually function (and the sting apparatus does not detach) unless the sting is embedded in fleshy tissue. While the sting can also penetrate the membranes between joints in the exoskeleton of other insects (and is used in fights between queens), in the case of ''Apis cerana japonica'', defense against larger insects such as predatory wasps (e.g. [[Asian giant hornet]]) is usually performed by surrounding the intruder with a mass of defending worker bees, which vibrate their muscles vigorously to raise the temperature of the intruder to a lethal level (\"balling\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2001/Thawley/defense.htm |title=Heat tolerance as a weapon |author=C.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] mentioned this in his ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'':\n{{cquote|The honey-bee is not a native of our continent. [[Georg Marcgrave|Marcgrave]] indeed mentions a species of honey-bee in Brasil. But this has no sting, and is therefore different from the one we have, which resembles perfectly that of Europe. The [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] concur with us in the tradition that it was brought from Europe; but, when, and by whom, we know not. The bees have generally extended themselves into the country, a little in advance of the white settlers. The Indians therefore call them the white man's fly, and consider their approach as indicating the approach of the settlements of the whites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/bees-and-honey|title=Bees and Honey|website=www.monticello.org}}</ref>}}\n\nHoney bees have become an invasive species in the US, outcompeting native pollinators when resources are tight.<ref>[https://blog.education.nationalgeographic.org/2018/01/29/honeybees-help-farmers-but-they-dont-help-the-environment/ Honeybees Help Farmers, But They Don\u2019t Help the Environment]<br/>Are honeybees a harmful invasive species?\n* They can be, when they outcompete native bees for food. \u201cWhen flowers are abundant, there is plenty of pollen for both honeybees and their wild cousins. But in many landscapes, or when an orchard stops blooming, farmed honeybees can compete with wild bees for food, making it harder for wild species to survive.\u201d</ref>\n\nMost flowering plants depend on specialized pollinators to efficiently fertilize them. [[Cucurbitaceae|Cucurbits]], for example, are pollinated by [[squash bee]]s that specifically visit the early-blooming male flowers before sunrise, when honey bees are inactive, and then return to pollinate the female flowers later in the day. Such [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] also mean that the specialized pollinator will be covered mainly in its host's specific pollen. \n\nUnfortunately, the very generalized nature of the honey bee's nectar-gathering activities, potentially visiting dozens of different species in a single day, means that a flower visited by a honey bee will often get very little pollen from its own species. This diminished pollination can reduce the plant's ability to produce seeds, especially when the honey bees are squeezing out the native pollinators for a species, a problem occurring all over the United States because of honey bees and other invasive species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/bee-battles-why-our-native-pollinators-are-losing-the-war-40620|title=Bee battles: why our native pollinators are losing the war|first=Kelsey K.|last=Graham|website=The Conversation}}</ref><ref>[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0189268 Do managed bees have negative effects on wild bees?: A systematic review of the literature]<br/>Our review found that the majority of studies reach the conclusion that managed bees negatively affect, or have the potential to negatively affect, wild bees through competition, changes in plant communities, or transmission of pathogens.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidescience.org/news/how-bees-you-know-are-killing-bees-you-don%E2%80%99t|title=How the Bees You Know are Killing the Bees You Don't|date=January 19, 2017|website=Inside Science}}</ref>\n\n==Communication==\n{{Main|Bee learning and communication}}\nHoney bees are known to communicate through many different chemicals and odors, as is common in insects.  They also rely on a sophisticated dance language that conveys information about the distance and direction to a specific location (typically a nutritional source, e.g., flowers or water).

While [[tattoo]]s are generally considered permanent, it is now possible to remove them with treatments, fully or partially.\n\nThe \"standard modality for tattoo removal\"<ref name=\"Sardana\"/> is the non-invasive removal of tattoo pigments using [[Q-switched lasers]]. Different types of Q-switched lasers are used to target different colors of tattoo ink depending on the specific light absorption spectra of the tattoo pigments. \nTypically, black and other darker-colored inks can be removed completely using Q-switched lasers while lighter colors such as yellows and greens are still very difficult to remove. Success can depend on a wide variety of factors including skin color, ink color, and the depth at which the ink was applied.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Sardana\"/>\n\nQ-switched lasers first became commercially available in the early 1990s. For a couple of decades before that, [[continuous-wave laser]]s were used as medical lasers for tattoo removal. Continuous-wave lasers used a high energy beam that ablated the target area and destroyed surrounding tissue structures as well as tattoo ink. Treatment tended to be painful and cause scarring.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Sardana\"/>\n\nBefore the development of [[laser]] tattoo removal methods, common techniques included [[dermabrasion]], TCA ([[Trichloroacetic acid]], an [[acid]] that removes the top layers of [[skin]], reaching as deep as the layer in which the tattoo ink resides), salabrasion (scrubbing the skin with [[salt]]), [[cryosurgery]] and [[:wikt:excision|excision]] which is sometimes still used along with skin grafts for larger tattoos.<ref name=\"Kent\"/><ref name=\"Sardana\"/><ref name=\"Cannarozzo\">{{cite journal |last1=Cannarozzo |first1=Giovanni |last2=Duca |first2=Ester Del |last3=Cannizzaro |first3=Maria Vittoria |title=Laser tattoo removal: results and issues |journal=PMFA News |date=2017 |volume=4 |issue=6 |url=https://www.thepmfajournal.com/features/post/laser-tattoo-removal-results-and-issues |accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref> Many other methods for removing tattoos have been suggested historically including the injection or application of [[tannic acid]], [[lemon juice]], [[garlic]] and [[pigeon]] dung.<ref name=\"Mao\">{{Cite book|last1=Mao |first1=Johnny C. |last2=DeJoseph |first2=Louis M. |title=Latest Innovations for Tattoo and Permanent Makeup Removal |journal=Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America |date=May 2012 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=125\u2013134 |doi=10.1016/j.fsc.2012.02.009 |pmid=22537781 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ett3agCGaxsC&pg=PA126|isbn=978-1455745142 }}</ref><ref name=\"Arellano\">{{cite journal |last1=Arellano |first1=CR |last2=Leopold |first2=DA |last3=Shafiroff |first3=BB |title=Tattoo removal: comparative study of six methods in the pig |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |date=December 1982 |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=699\u2013703 |pmid=7146152 |doi=10.1097/00006534-198212000-00007}}</ref>\n\nRecent research is investigating the potential of multi-pass treatments and the use of picosecond laser technology, which seem promising.<ref name=\"Goh\">{{cite journal |last1=Goh |first1=CheeLeok |last2=Ho |first2=StephanieGY |title=Laser tattoo removal: A clinical update |journal=Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery |date=2015 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=9\u201315 |doi=10.4103/0974-2077.155066 |pmid=25949017 |pmc=4411606 }}</ref><ref name=\"Kossida\">{{cite journal |last1=Kossida |first1=Theodora |last2=Rigopoulos |first2=Dimitrios |last3=Katsambas |first3=Andreas |last4=Anderson |first4=R.

Dermal [[macrophages]] are part of the immune system, tasked with collecting and digesting cellular debris. In the case of tattoo pigments, macrophages collect ink pigments, but have difficulty breaking them down.  Instead, they store the ink pigments. If a macrophage is damaged, it releases its captive ink, which is taken up by other macrophages. This can make it particularly difficult to remove tattoos. When treatments break down ink particles into smaller pieces, macrophages can more easily remove them.<ref name=\"Wilhelm\">{{cite news |last1=Wilhelm |first1=Menaka |title=Tattoo You: Immune System Cells Help Keep Ink In Its Place |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/03/08/591315450/tattoo-you-immune-system-cells-help-keep-ink-in-its-place |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=NPR |date=March 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nTattoo pigments have specific light absorption spectra.

Laser treatment of pigmented lesions and tattoos. Semin Cutan Med Surg. 2000 Dec;19(4):239.</ref>  While normal human growth and healing processes will remove small foreign particles from the skin, tattoo pigment particles are too big to be removed automatically. Laser treatment causes tattoo pigment particles to heat up and fragment into smaller pieces.  These smaller pieces are then removed by normal body processes. Q-switched lasers  produce bursts of infrared light at specific frequencies that target a particular spectrum of color in the tattoo ink. The laser passes through the upper layers of the skin to target a specific pigment in the lower layers.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nLaser tattoo removal is a successful application of the theory of selective [[photothermolysis]] (SPTL).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = RR | last2 = Parrish | first2 = JA | date = Apr 1983 | title = Selective photothermolysis: precise microsurgery by selective absorption of pulsed radiation | url = | journal = Science | volume = 220 | issue = 4596| pages = 524\u20137 | doi=10.1126/science.6836297| pmid = 6836297 | bibcode = 1983Sci...220..524A }}</ref>  However, unlike treatments for blood vessels or hair the mechanism required to shatter tattoo particles uses the [[photomechanical effect]]. In this situation the energy is absorbed by the ink particles in a very short time, typically nanoseconds. The surface temperature of the ink particles can rise to thousands of degrees but this energy profile rapidly collapses into a shock wave. This shock wave then propagates throughout the local tissue (the dermis) causing brittle structures to fragment. Hence tissues are largely unaffected since they simply vibrate as the shock wave passes. For laser tattoo removal the selective destruction of tattoo pigments depends on four factors:\n* The color of the light must penetrate sufficiently deep into the skin to reach the tattoo pigment. Pigments deeper in the skin are harder to remove than those near the surface.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n* The color of the laser light must be more highly absorbed by the tattoo pigment than the surrounding skin.  Different tattoo pigments therefore require different laser colors.  For example, red light is highly absorbed by green tattoo pigments, while yellow tends not to absorb light.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n* The time duration (pulse duration) of the laser energy must be very short, so that the tattoo pigment is heated to fragmentation temperature before its heat can dissipate to the surrounding skin.  Otherwise, heating of the surrounding tissue can cause burns or scars.  For laser tattoo removal, this duration should be on the order of nanoseconds.\n* Sufficient energy must be delivered during each laser pulse to heat the pigment to fragmentation.  If the energy is too low, pigment will not fragment and no removal will take place.\n\nQ-switched lasers are the only commercially available devices that can meet these requirements.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Kilmer SL.

Different lasers are better for different tattoo colors. Consequently, multi-color tattoo removal almost always requires the use of two or more laser wavelengths. Tattoo removal lasers are usually identified by the lasing medium used to create the wavelength (measured in nanometers (nm)):\n* Q-switched Frequency-doubled Nd:YAG: 532&nbsp;nm. This laser creates a green light which is highly absorbed by red, yellow, and orange targets. Useful primarily for red and orange tattoo pigments, this wavelength is also highly absorbed by melanin (the chemical which gives skin color or tan) which makes the laser wavelength effective for age spot or sun spot removal. Nd:YAG lasers may cause hemoglobin absorption, leading to [[purpura]] (collection of blood under tissue in large areas), [[pinpoint bleeding]], or whitening of the skin.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Beyer|first1=Victor|title=Laser Parameters Within Tattoo Removal|url=http://rethinktheinklasertattooremoval.com/laser-parameters-within-tattoo-removal/|publisher=Rethink the Ink|accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref>\n* Q-switched Ruby: 694&nbsp;nm. This laser creates a red light which is highly absorbed by green and dark tattoo pigments.  Because it is more highly absorbed by melanin this laser may produce undesirable side effects such as pigmentary changes for patients of all but white skin.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kilmer | first1 = SL | last2 = Anderson | first2 = RR | date = Apr 1993 | title = Clinical use of the Q-switched ruby and the Q-switched Nd:YAG (1064 nm and 532 nm) lasers for treatment of tattoos | url = | journal = J Dermatol Surg Oncol | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 330\u20138 | doi=10.1111/j.1524-4725.1993.tb00354.x| pmid = 8478472 }}</ref> This is the best wavelength for blue ink.\n* Q-switched Alexandrite: 755&nbsp;nm. The weakest of all the q-switched devices and somewhat similar to the Ruby laser in that the Alexandrite creates a red light which is highly absorbed by green and dark tattoo pigments. However, the alexandrite laser color is slightly less absorbed by melanin, so this laser has a slightly lower incidence of unwanted pigmentary changes than a ruby laser.<ref>Alster TS. Q-switched alexandrite laser treatment (755 nm) of professional and amateur tattoos. ''J Am Acad Dermatol''. 1995 Jul;33(1):69\u201373.</ref> This laser works well on green tattoos but because of its weaker peak power it works only moderately well on black and blue ink. It does not work at all (or very minimally) on red, orange, yellow, brown, etc. This laser wavelength is also available in a picosecond speed with anecdotal claims that it removes ink faster.\n* Q-switched Nd:YAG: 1064&nbsp;nm.  This laser creates a near-infrared light (invisible to humans) which is poorly absorbed by [[melanin]], making this the only laser suitable for darker skin. This laser wavelength is also absorbed by all dark tattoo pigments and is the safest wavelength to use on the tissue due to the low melanin absorption and low [[hemoglobin]] absorption.  This is the wavelength of choice for tattoo removal in darker skin types and for black ink.\n* Dye modules are available for some lasers to convert 532&nbsp;nm to 650&nbsp;nm or 585&nbsp;nm light which allows one laser system to safely and effectively treat multi-color tattoo inks. When dye modules take 532&nbsp;nm laser wavelength and change it, there is a loss of energy. Treatments with dye packs, while effective for the first few treatments, many not be able to clear these ink colors fully.  The role of [[dye lasers]] in tattoo removal is discussed in detail in the literature.<ref>[[F. J. Duarte]] (ed.), ''Tunable Laser Applications'' (CRC, New York, 2009) Chapter 8.</ref>\n\nPulsewidth or pulse duration is a critical laser parameter. All Q-switched lasers have appropriate pulse durations for tattoo removal.\n\nSpot size, or the width of the laser beam, affects treatment. Light is optically scattered in the skin, like automobile headlights in fog. Larger spot sizes slightly increase the effective penetration depth of the laser light, thus enabling more effective targeting of deeper tattoo pigments. Larger spot sizes also help make treatments faster.\n\nFluence or energy density is another important consideration. Fluence is measured in joules per square centimeter (J/cm\u00b2). It is important to be treated at high enough settings to fragment tattoo particles.\n\nRepetition rate helps make treatments faster but is not associated with any treatment effect. Faster treatments are usually preferred because the pain ends sooner.\n\n===Number of laser tattoo removal treatment sessions needed===\nComplete laser tattoo removal requires numerous treatment sessions, typically spaced at least seven weeks apart.  Treating more frequently than seven weeks increases the risk of adverse effects and does not necessarily increase the rate of ink absorption. Anecdotal reports of treatments sessions at four weeks leads to more scarring and dischromia and can be a source of liability for clinicians. At each session, some but not all of the tattoo pigment particles are effectively fragmented, and the body removes the smallest fragments over the course of several weeks or months.  The result is that the tattoo is lightened over time.  Remaining large particles of tattoo pigment are then targeted at subsequent treatment sessions, causing further lightening. The number of sessions and spacing between treatments depends on various parameters, including the area of the body treated, skin color and effectiveness of the immune system.  Tattoos located on the extremities, such as the ankle, generally take longest. As tattoos fade clinicians may recommend that patients wait many months between treatments to facilitate ink resolution and minimize unwanted side effects.\n\nThe amount of time required for the removal of a tattoo and the success of the removal varies with each individual and their immune system function. Factors influencing this include: skin type, location, color, amount of ink, scarring or tissue change, layers of ink, immune system function and circulation. Factors under the individual's control are more time between treatments, nutrition, stress, sleep, exercise and fluid levels. In the past health care providers would simply guess on the number of treatments a patient needed which was rather frustrating to patients. A predictive scale, the \"Kirby-Desai Scale\",<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jitchotvisut |first1=Janaki |title=9 questions you've always had about tattoo removal, answered |url=https://www.insider.com/everything-you-should-know-about-tattoo-removal-2019-7 |website=Insider |accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref> was developed by Dr. [[Will Kirby]] and Dr. Alpesh Desai, dermatologists with specialization in tattoo removal techniques, to assess the potential success and number of treatments necessary for laser tattoo removal, provided the medical practitioner is using a Q-switched Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) laser incorporating selective photothermolysis with six weeks between treatments.<ref name=\"KD\">{{cite journal|last1=Kirby|first1=William|last2=Desai|first2=Alpesh|last3=Desai|first3=Tejas|last4=Kartono|first4=Francisca|last5=Geeta|first5=Patel|title=The Kirby-Desai Scale|journal=The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology|date=21 December 2016|volume=2|issue=3|pages=32\u201337|pmc=2923953|issn=1941-2789|pmid=20729941}}</ref>\n\nThe Kirby-Desai Scale assigns numerical values to six parameters:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kirby |first1=William |title=The Kirby-Desai Scale A Proposed Scale to Assess Tattoo-removal Treatments |journal=The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=32\u201337 |pmc=2923953 |year=2009 |pmid=20729941 }}</ref> skin type, location, color, amount of ink, scarring or tissue change, and layering. Parameter scores are then added to yield a combined score that will show the estimated number of treatments needed for successful tattoo removal. Experts recommend that the Kirby-Desai scale be used by all laser practitioners prior to starting tattoo removal treatment to help determine the number of treatments required for tattoo removal and as a predictor of the success of the laser tattoo removal treatments.<ref name=\"KD\" /> Prior to 2009, clinicians had no scientific basis by which to estimate the number of treatments needed to remove a tattoo and the use of this scale is now standard practice in laser tattoo removal.\n\nCertain colors have proved more difficult to remove than others. In particular, this occurs when treated with the wrong wavelength of laser light is used. Some have postulated that the reason for slow resolution of green ink in particular is due to its significantly smaller molecular size relative to the other colours.<ref>Konstadinos Siomos; Raymond T. Bailey; Frank R. Cruickshank; Michael J. Murphy; Q-switched laser removal of tattoos: a clinical and spectroscopic investigation of the mechanism. Proc. SPIE 2623, Medical Applications of Lasers III, 40 (Jan 1996); {{DOI|10.1117/12.230314}}</ref> Consequently, green ink tattoos may require treatment with 755&nbsp;nm light but may also respond to 694&nbsp;nm, 650&nbsp;nm and 1064&nbsp;nm. Multiple wavelengths of light may be needed to remove colored inks.\n\nOne small Greek study showed that the R20 method\u2014four passes with the laser, twenty minutes apart\u2014caused more breaking up of the ink than the conventional method without more scarring or adverse effects. However, this study was performed on a very small patient population (12 patients total), using the weakest of the QS lasers, the 755&nbsp;nm Alexandrite laser. One of the other main problems with this study was the fact that more than half of the 18 tattoos removed were not professional and amateur tattoos are always easier to remove. Proof of concept studies are underway, but many laser experts advise against the R20 method using the more modern and powerful tattoo removal lasers available at most offices as an increase in adverse side effects including scarring and dischromia is likely. Patients should inquire about the laser being used if the R20 treatment method is offered by a facility as it is usually only offered by clinics that are using the weak 755&nbsp;nm Alexandrite as opposed to the more powerful and versatile devices that are more commonly used. Moreover, dermatologists offering the R20 method should inform patients that it just one alternative to proven protocols and is not a gold standard treatment method to remove tattoos.\n\nMultiple pass treatment methods (R20, as mentioned above, and R0) have generally shown to carry a greater risk of side effects, due to the increased amount of energy used in treatment. One caveat to this, however, is incorporating a perfluorodecalin (PFD) patch into the protocol<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/lsm.22399 | volume=47 | title=Rapid, high-fluence multi-pass q-switched laser treatment of tattoos with a transparent perfluorodecalin-infused patch: A pilot study | year=2015 | journal=Lasers in Surgery and Medicine | pages=613\u2013618 | last1 = Biesman | first1 = Brian S. | last2 = O'Neil | first2 = Michael P. | last3 = Costner | first3 = Cara}}</ref>. A PFD patch utilizes a clear silicone gel patch, with a small amount of PFD liquid applied to the treatment area immediately before each pass of laser application, and conducting the passes in rapid succession. The combination of the patch and liquid reduce the epidermal scatter, which can limit the predicted side effects typically seen in aggressive laser tattoo removal treatments (hyper and hypopigmentation, blistering, etc)<ref>https://www.laserskinsurgery.com/f/Tattoo_Publication_040919.pdf</ref>. Additionally, the liquid reduces the laser frosting very quickly, allowing for faster re-treatment, limiting the time of treatment while still improving efficacy. Early studies have been performed to indicate improved clearance with the use of this patch in 3-4 passes, in a single session, utilizing more energy than typically allowable with a traditional treatment methodology<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/lsm.22106 | volume=45 | title=Topical perfluorodecalin resolves immediate whitening reactions and allows rapid effective multiple pass treatment of tattoos | year=2013 | journal=Lasers in Surgery and Medicine | pages=76\u201380 | last1 = Reddy | first1 = Kavitha K. | last2 = Brauer | first2 = Jeremy A. | last3 = Anolik | first3 = Robert | last4 = Bernstein | first4 = Leonard | last5 = Brightman | first5 = Lori | last6 = Hale | first6 = Elizabeth | last7 = Karen | first7 = Julie | last8 = Weiss | first8 = Elliot | last9 = Geronemus | first9 = Roy G.}}</ref>. All these physical properties of the patch work to substantially reduce the total number of laser treatment required for ink clearance. While the PFD patch is currently FDA cleared for use with all pico and nanosecond domain lasers and wavelengths, it is only cleared for Fitzpatrick Skin Types I-III. Early studies have shown anecdotally that there isn't necessarily increased risks with Fitzpatrick Skin Types IV-VI, though still not FDA cleared as an indication<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/lsm.23022 | volume=51 | title=Perfluorodecalin-infused patch in picosecond and Q-switched laser-assisted tattoo removal: Safety in Fitzpatrick IV-VI skin types | year=2019 | journal=Lasers in Surgery and Medicine | pages=23\u201326 | last1 = Vangipuram | first1 = Ramya | last2 = Hamill | first2 = Selina S. | last3 = Friedman | first3 = Paul M.}}</ref>.\n\n===Factors contributing to the success of laser tattoo removal===\nThere are a number of factors that determine how many treatments will be needed and the level of success one might experience. Age of tattoo, ink density, color and even where the tattoo is located on the body, all play an important role in how many treatments will be needed for complete removal. However, a rarely recognized factor of tattoo removal is the role of the client\u2019s immune response.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Costandi |first1=Mo |title=Tats Off: Targeting the Immune System May Lead to Better Tattoo Removal |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tats-off-targeting-the-immune-system-may-lead-to-better-tattoo-removal/ |website=Scientific American |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref> The normal process of tattoo removal is fragmentation followed by [[phagocytosis]] which is then drained away via the [[Lymphatic system|lymphatics]]. Consequently, it is the inflammation resulting from the actual laser treatment and the natural stimulation of the hosts\u2019 immune response that ultimately results in removal of tattoo ink; thus variations in results are enormous.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Dustin|title=Factors Determining Tattoo Removal Success|url=http://www.falleninktattooremoval.com/2017/02/08/factors-determining-tattoo-removal-success/|publisher=Fallen Ink Tattoo Removal|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Pain management during treatment===\nLaser tattoo removal is uncomfortable - many patients say it is worse than getting the tattoo. The pain is often described to be similar to that of hot oil on the skin, or a \"snap\" from an elastic band.  Depending on the patient's [[pain threshold]], and while some patients may forgo anesthesia  altogether, most patients will require some form of local anesthesia. Pre-treatment might include the application of an anesthetic cream under occlusion for 45 to 90 minutes or cooling by ice or cold air prior to the laser treatment session. A better method is complete anesthesia which can be administered locally by injections of 1% to 2% lidocaine with epinephrine.\n\nA technique which helps to reduce the pain sensation felt by patients has been described by MJ Murphy<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = Michael J. | year = 2014 | title = A novel, simple and efficacious technique for tattoo removal resulting in less pain using the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser | journal = Lasers in Medical Science | volume = 29| issue = 4| pages = 1445\u20131447| doi=10.1007/s10103-014-1542-3| pmid = 24584904 }}</ref> He used a standard microscope glass slide pressed against the tattooed skin and fired the laser through the glass. This technique may represent a simplest and effective method to reduce the pain sensation when treating small tattoos.\n\n===Post-treatment considerations===\nImmediately after laser treatment, a slightly elevated, white discoloration with or without the presence of punctuate bleeding is often observed. This white color change is thought to be the result of rapid, heat-formed steam or gas, causing dermal and epidermal vacuolization.  Pinpoint bleeding represents vascular injury from photoacoustic waves created by the laser's interaction with tattoo pigment. Minimal edema and [[erythema]] of adjacent normal skin usually resolve within 24 hours. Subsequently, a crust appears over the entire tattoo, which sloughs off at approximately two weeks post-treatment. As noted above, some tattoo pigment may be found within this crust. Post-operative wound care consists of simple wound care and a non-occlusive dressing. Since the application of laser light is sterile there is no need for topical antibiotics. Moreover, topical antibiotic ointments can cause allergic reactions and should be avoided. Fading of the tattoo will be noted over the next eight weeks and re-treatment energy levels can be tailored depending on the clinical response observed.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Kirby, William; Desai, Alpesh; Desai, Tejas; Kartona, Francisa.  Tattoo Removal Techniques: Effective Tattoo Removal Treatments - Part 2, Skin and Aging, October, 2005.</ref>\n\n===Side effects and complications===\nAbout half of the patients treated with Q-switched lasers for tattoo removal will show some transient changes in the normal skin pigmentation. These changes usually resolve in 6 to 12 months but may rarely be permanent.<ref name=\"drtattoff.com\">{{cite journal|author1=Kirby, William|author2=Koriakos, Angie|author3=Desai, Alpesh|author4=Desai, Tejas|title=Undesired Pigmentary Alterations Associated with Q-Switched Laser Tattoo Removal|journal=Skin and Aging|date=August 2010|url=http://www.drtattoff.com/images/articles/Undesired-Pigmentary-Alterations-Associated-with-Q-Switched-Laser-Tattoo-Removal-Skin-and-Aging-Aug-2010.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928125102/http://drtattoff.com/images/articles/Undesired-Pigmentary-Alterations-Associated-with-Q-Switched-Laser-Tattoo-Removal-Skin-and-Aging-Aug-2010.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-09-28}}</ref>\n\nHyperpigmentation is related to the patient's [[skin tone]], with skin types IV, V and VI more prone regardless of the wavelength used. Twice daily treatment with hydroquinones and broad-spectrum sunscreens usually resolves the hyperpigmentation within a few months, although, in some patients, resolution can be prolonged.<ref name=\"drtattoff.com\"/>\n\nHypopigmentation is more commonly observed in darker skin tones. It is more likely to occur with higher fluence and more frequent treatments. Sometimes lighter skin exhibits hypopigmentation after a series of treatments. Allowing more time between treatments reduces chances of hypopigmentation. Since it is more likely to see hypopigmentation after multiple treatments, some practitioners suggest waiting a few additional weeks, after a few sessions. Usually treatment stops until hypopigmentation resolves in a matter of months.\n\nTransient textural changes are occasionally noted but often resolve within a few months; however, permanent textural changes and scarring very rarely occur. If a patient is prone to pigmentary or textural changes, longer treatment intervals are recommended. Additionally, if a blister or crust forms following treatment, it is imperative that the patient does not manipulate this secondary skin change. Early removal of a blister of crust increases the chances of developing a scar. Additionally, patients with a history of hypertrophic or keloidal scarring need to be warned of their increased risk of scarring.\n\nLocal allergic responses to many tattoo pigments have been reported, and allergic reactions to tattoo pigment after Q-switched laser treatment are also possible.  Rarely, when yellow cadmium sulfide is used to \"brighten\" the red or yellow portion of a tattoo, a photoallergic reaction may occur.  The reaction is also common with red ink, which may contain cinnabar (mercuric sulphide).   Erythema, pruritus, and even inflamed nodules, verrucose papules, or granulomas may present. The reaction will be confined to the site of the red/yellow ink.  Treatment consists of strict sunlight avoidance, sunscreen, interlesional steroid injections, or in some cases, surgical removal. Unlike the destructive modalities described, Q-switched lasers mobilize the ink and may generate a systemic allergic response. Oral antihistamines and anti-inflammatory steroids have been used to treat allergic reactions to tattoo ink.\n\nStudies of various tattoo pigments have shown that a number of pigments (most containing iron oxide or titanium dioxide) change color when irradiated with Q-switched laser energy. Some tattoo colors including flesh tones, light red, white, peach and light brown containing pigments as well as some green and blue tattoo pigments, changed to black when irradiated with Q-switched laser pulses. The resulting gray-black color may require more treatments to remove. If tattoo darkening does occur, after 8 weeks the newly darkened tattoo can be treated as if it were black pigment.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Kirby, William|author2=Kaur, Ravneet Ruby|author3=Desai, Alpesh|title=Paradoxical darkening and removal of pink tattoo ink|journal=Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology|date=June 2010|url=http://www.drtattoff.com/images/articles/Paradoxical-darkening-and-removal-of-pink-tattoo-ink-JOCD-Jun-2010.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928101437/http://drtattoff.com/images/articles/Paradoxical-darkening-and-removal-of-pink-tattoo-ink-JOCD-Jun-2010.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nVery rarely, non Q-switched laser treatments, like CO2 or Argon lasers, which are very rarely offered these days, can rupture blood vessels and aerosolize tissue requiring a plastic shield or a cone device to protect the laser operator from tissue and blood contact. Protective eyewear may be worn if the laser operator chooses to do so.\n\nWith the mechanical or salabrasion method of tattoo removal, the incidence of scarring, pigmentary alteration (hyper- and hypopigmentation), and ink retention are extremely high.<ref>Kirby, William, Desai, Alpesh, Desai, Tejas, Kartona, Francisa, Tattoo Removal Techniques: Effective Tattoo Removal Treatments - Part 1, Skin and Aging, September, 2005</ref>\n\nThe use of Q-switched lasers could very rarely produce the development of large [[bulla (dermatology)|bulla]].  However, if  patients follow post care directions to elevate, rest, and apply intermittent icing, it should minimize the chances of bulla and other adverse effects. In addition, health care practitioners should contemplate the use of a cooling device during the tattoo removal procedure. While  the infrequent bulla development is a possible side effect of Q-switched laser tattoo removal, if treated appropriately and quickly by the health care practitioner, it is unlikely that long term consequences would ensue.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Kirby W|author2=Kartono F|author3=Desai A|author4=Kaur R|author5=Desai T|title=Treatment of Large Bulla Formation after Tattoo Removal with a Q-Switched Laser|journal=Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology|date=January 2010|url=http://www.jcadonline.com/2210/treatment-of-large-bulla-formation-after-tattoo-removal-with-a-q-switched-laser/#more-2210}}</ref>\n\n===Risks===\nAlthough laser treatment is well known and often used to remove tattoos, unwanted side effects of laser tattoo removal include the possibility of discoloration of the skin such as hypopigmentation (white spots, more common in darker skin) and hyperpigmentation (dark spots) as well as textural changes - these changes are usually not permanent when the Nd:YAG is used but it is much more likely with the use of the 755&nbsp;nm Alexandrite, the 694&nbsp;nm Ruby and the R20 method. Very rarely, burns may result in scarring but this usually only occurs when patients do not care for the treated area properly.  Occasionally, \"paradoxical darkening\" of a tattoo may occur, when a treated tattoo becomes darker instead of lighter.  This occurs most often with white ink, flesh tones, pink, and cosmetic make-up tattoos.<ref>S. Varma, et al. Tattoo ink darkening of a yellow tattoo after Q-switched laser treatment.

This has not yet been reported in vivo but has been shown in laboratory tests. Laser removal of traumatic tattoos may similarly be complicated depending on the substance of the pigmenting material. In one reported instance, the use of a laser resulted in the ignition of embedded particles of firework debris.<ref>Taylor Charles R., \"Laser ignition of traumatically embedded firework debris,\" ''Lasers in Surgery and Medicine'', 1998, volume 22, p. 157\u2013158</ref>\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = E.

While [[tattoo]]s are generally considered permanent, it is now possible to remove them with treatments, fully or partially.\n\nThe \"standard modality for tattoo removal\"<ref name=\"Sardana\"/> is the non-invasive removal of tattoo pigments using [[Q-switched lasers]]. Different types of Q-switched lasers are used to target different colors of tattoo ink depending on the specific light absorption spectra of the tattoo pigments. \nTypically, black and other darker-colored inks can be removed completely using Q-switched lasers while lighter colors such as yellows and greens are still very difficult to remove. Success can depend on a wide variety of factors including skin color, ink color, and the depth at which the ink was applied.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Sardana\"/>\n\nQ-switched lasers first became commercially available in the early 1990s. For a couple of decades before that, [[continuous-wave laser]]s were used as medical lasers for tattoo removal. Continuous-wave lasers used a high energy beam that ablated the target area and destroyed surrounding tissue structures as well as tattoo ink. Treatment tended to be painful and cause scarring.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Sardana\"/>\n\nBefore the development of [[laser]] tattoo removal methods, common techniques included [[dermabrasion]], TCA ([[Trichloroacetic acid]], an [[acid]] that removes the top layers of [[skin]], reaching as deep as the layer in which the tattoo ink resides), salabrasion (scrubbing the skin with [[salt]]), [[cryosurgery]] and [[:wikt:excision|excision]] which is sometimes still used along with skin grafts for larger tattoos.<ref name=\"Kent\"/><ref name=\"Sardana\"/><ref name=\"Cannarozzo\">{{cite journal |last1=Cannarozzo |first1=Giovanni |last2=Duca |first2=Ester Del |last3=Cannizzaro |first3=Maria Vittoria |title=Laser tattoo removal: results and issues |journal=PMFA News |date=2017 |volume=4 |issue=6 |url=https://www.thepmfajournal.com/features/post/laser-tattoo-removal-results-and-issues |accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref> Many other methods for removing tattoos have been suggested historically including the injection or application of [[tannic acid]], [[lemon juice]], [[garlic]] and [[pigeon]] dung.<ref name=\"Mao\">{{Cite book|last1=Mao |first1=Johnny C. |last2=DeJoseph |first2=Louis M. |title=Latest Innovations for Tattoo and Permanent Makeup Removal |journal=Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America |date=May 2012 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=125\u2013134 |doi=10.1016/j.fsc.2012.02.009 |pmid=22537781 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ett3agCGaxsC&pg=PA126|isbn=978-1455745142 }}</ref><ref name=\"Arellano\">{{cite journal |last1=Arellano |first1=CR |last2=Leopold |first2=DA |last3=Shafiroff |first3=BB |title=Tattoo removal: comparative study of six methods in the pig |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |date=December 1982 |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=699\u2013703 |pmid=7146152 |doi=10.1097/00006534-198212000-00007}}</ref>\n\nRecent research is investigating the potential of multi-pass treatments and the use of picosecond laser technology, which seem promising.<ref name=\"Goh\">{{cite journal |last1=Goh |first1=CheeLeok |last2=Ho |first2=StephanieGY |title=Laser tattoo removal: A clinical update |journal=Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery |date=2015 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=9\u201315 |doi=10.4103/0974-2077.155066 |pmid=25949017 |pmc=4411606 }}</ref><ref name=\"Kossida\">{{cite journal |last1=Kossida |first1=Theodora |last2=Rigopoulos |first2=Dimitrios |last3=Katsambas |first3=Andreas |last4=Anderson |first4=R.

Dermal [[macrophages]] are part of the immune system, tasked with collecting and digesting cellular debris. In the case of tattoo pigments, macrophages collect ink pigments, but have difficulty breaking them down.  Instead, they store the ink pigments. If a macrophage is damaged, it releases its captive ink, which is taken up by other macrophages. This can make it particularly difficult to remove tattoos. When treatments break down ink particles into smaller pieces, macrophages can more easily remove them.<ref name=\"Wilhelm\">{{cite news |last1=Wilhelm |first1=Menaka |title=Tattoo You: Immune System Cells Help Keep Ink In Its Place |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/03/08/591315450/tattoo-you-immune-system-cells-help-keep-ink-in-its-place |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=NPR |date=March 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nTattoo pigments have specific light absorption spectra.

Laser treatment of pigmented lesions and tattoos. Semin Cutan Med Surg. 2000 Dec;19(4):239.</ref>  While normal human growth and healing processes will remove small foreign particles from the skin, tattoo pigment particles are too big to be removed automatically. Laser treatment causes tattoo pigment particles to heat up and fragment into smaller pieces.  These smaller pieces are then removed by normal body processes. Q-switched lasers  produce bursts of infrared light at specific frequencies that target a particular spectrum of color in the tattoo ink. The laser passes through the upper layers of the skin to target a specific pigment in the lower layers.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nLaser tattoo removal is a successful application of the theory of selective [[photothermolysis]] (SPTL).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = RR | last2 = Parrish | first2 = JA | date = Apr 1983 | title = Selective photothermolysis: precise microsurgery by selective absorption of pulsed radiation | url = | journal = Science | volume = 220 | issue = 4596| pages = 524\u20137 | doi=10.1126/science.6836297| pmid = 6836297 | bibcode = 1983Sci...220..524A }}</ref>  However, unlike treatments for blood vessels or hair the mechanism required to shatter tattoo particles uses the [[photomechanical effect]]. In this situation the energy is absorbed by the ink particles in a very short time, typically nanoseconds. The surface temperature of the ink particles can rise to thousands of degrees but this energy profile rapidly collapses into a shock wave. This shock wave then propagates throughout the local tissue (the dermis) causing brittle structures to fragment. Hence tissues are largely unaffected since they simply vibrate as the shock wave passes. For laser tattoo removal the selective destruction of tattoo pigments depends on four factors:\n* The color of the light must penetrate sufficiently deep into the skin to reach the tattoo pigment. Pigments deeper in the skin are harder to remove than those near the surface.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n* The color of the laser light must be more highly absorbed by the tattoo pigment than the surrounding skin.  Different tattoo pigments therefore require different laser colors.  For example, red light is highly absorbed by green tattoo pigments, while yellow tends not to absorb light.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n* The time duration (pulse duration) of the laser energy must be very short, so that the tattoo pigment is heated to fragmentation temperature before its heat can dissipate to the surrounding skin.  Otherwise, heating of the surrounding tissue can cause burns or scars.  For laser tattoo removal, this duration should be on the order of nanoseconds.\n* Sufficient energy must be delivered during each laser pulse to heat the pigment to fragmentation.  If the energy is too low, pigment will not fragment and no removal will take place.\n\nQ-switched lasers are the only commercially available devices that can meet these requirements.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Kilmer SL.

Different lasers are better for different tattoo colors. Consequently, multi-color tattoo removal almost always requires the use of two or more laser wavelengths. Tattoo removal lasers are usually identified by the lasing medium used to create the wavelength (measured in nanometers (nm)):\n* Q-switched Frequency-doubled Nd:YAG: 532&nbsp;nm. This laser creates a green light which is highly absorbed by red, yellow, and orange targets. Useful primarily for red and orange tattoo pigments, this wavelength is also highly absorbed by melanin (the chemical which gives skin color or tan) which makes the laser wavelength effective for age spot or sun spot removal. Nd:YAG lasers may cause hemoglobin absorption, leading to [[purpura]] (collection of blood under tissue in large areas), [[pinpoint bleeding]], or whitening of the skin.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Beyer|first1=Victor|title=Laser Parameters Within Tattoo Removal|url=http://rethinktheinklasertattooremoval.com/laser-parameters-within-tattoo-removal/|publisher=Rethink the Ink|accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref>\n* Q-switched Ruby: 694&nbsp;nm. This laser creates a red light which is highly absorbed by green and dark tattoo pigments.  Because it is more highly absorbed by melanin this laser may produce undesirable side effects such as pigmentary changes for patients of all but white skin.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kilmer | first1 = SL | last2 = Anderson | first2 = RR | date = Apr 1993 | title = Clinical use of the Q-switched ruby and the Q-switched Nd:YAG (1064 nm and 532 nm) lasers for treatment of tattoos | url = | journal = J Dermatol Surg Oncol | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 330\u20138 | doi=10.1111/j.1524-4725.1993.tb00354.x| pmid = 8478472 }}</ref> This is the best wavelength for blue ink.\n* Q-switched Alexandrite: 755&nbsp;nm. The weakest of all the q-switched devices and somewhat similar to the Ruby laser in that the Alexandrite creates a red light which is highly absorbed by green and dark tattoo pigments. However, the alexandrite laser color is slightly less absorbed by melanin, so this laser has a slightly lower incidence of unwanted pigmentary changes than a ruby laser.<ref>Alster TS. Q-switched alexandrite laser treatment (755 nm) of professional and amateur tattoos. ''J Am Acad Dermatol''. 1995 Jul;33(1):69\u201373.</ref> This laser works well on green tattoos but because of its weaker peak power it works only moderately well on black and blue ink. It does not work at all (or very minimally) on red, orange, yellow, brown, etc. This laser wavelength is also available in a picosecond speed with anecdotal claims that it removes ink faster.\n* Q-switched Nd:YAG: 1064&nbsp;nm.  This laser creates a near-infrared light (invisible to humans) which is poorly absorbed by [[melanin]], making this the only laser suitable for darker skin. This laser wavelength is also absorbed by all dark tattoo pigments and is the safest wavelength to use on the tissue due to the low melanin absorption and low [[hemoglobin]] absorption.  This is the wavelength of choice for tattoo removal in darker skin types and for black ink.\n* Dye modules are available for some lasers to convert 532&nbsp;nm to 650&nbsp;nm or 585&nbsp;nm light which allows one laser system to safely and effectively treat multi-color tattoo inks. When dye modules take 532&nbsp;nm laser wavelength and change it, there is a loss of energy. Treatments with dye packs, while effective for the first few treatments, many not be able to clear these ink colors fully.  The role of [[dye lasers]] in tattoo removal is discussed in detail in the literature.<ref>[[F. J. Duarte]] (ed.), ''Tunable Laser Applications'' (CRC, New York, 2009) Chapter 8.</ref>\n\nPulsewidth or pulse duration is a critical laser parameter. All Q-switched lasers have appropriate pulse durations for tattoo removal.\n\nSpot size, or the width of the laser beam, affects treatment. Light is optically scattered in the skin, like automobile headlights in fog. Larger spot sizes slightly increase the effective penetration depth of the laser light, thus enabling more effective targeting of deeper tattoo pigments. Larger spot sizes also help make treatments faster.\n\nFluence or energy density is another important consideration. Fluence is measured in joules per square centimeter (J/cm\u00b2). It is important to be treated at high enough settings to fragment tattoo particles.\n\nRepetition rate helps make treatments faster but is not associated with any treatment effect. Faster treatments are usually preferred because the pain ends sooner.\n\n===Number of laser tattoo removal treatment sessions needed===\nComplete laser tattoo removal requires numerous treatment sessions, typically spaced at least seven weeks apart.  Treating more frequently than seven weeks increases the risk of adverse effects and does not necessarily increase the rate of ink absorption. Anecdotal reports of treatments sessions at four weeks leads to more scarring and dischromia and can be a source of liability for clinicians. At each session, some but not all of the tattoo pigment particles are effectively fragmented, and the body removes the smallest fragments over the course of several weeks or months.  The result is that the tattoo is lightened over time.  Remaining large particles of tattoo pigment are then targeted at subsequent treatment sessions, causing further lightening. The number of sessions and spacing between treatments depends on various parameters, including the area of the body treated, skin color and effectiveness of the immune system.  Tattoos located on the extremities, such as the ankle, generally take longest. As tattoos fade clinicians may recommend that patients wait many months between treatments to facilitate ink resolution and minimize unwanted side effects.\n\nThe amount of time required for the removal of a tattoo and the success of the removal varies with each individual and their immune system function. Factors influencing this include: skin type, location, color, amount of ink, scarring or tissue change, layers of ink, immune system function and circulation. Factors under the individual's control are more time between treatments, nutrition, stress, sleep, exercise and fluid levels. In the past health care providers would simply guess on the number of treatments a patient needed which was rather frustrating to patients. A predictive scale, the \"Kirby-Desai Scale\",<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jitchotvisut |first1=Janaki |title=9 questions you've always had about tattoo removal, answered |url=https://www.insider.com/everything-you-should-know-about-tattoo-removal-2019-7 |website=Insider |accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref> was developed by Dr. [[Will Kirby]] and Dr. Alpesh Desai, dermatologists with specialization in tattoo removal techniques, to assess the potential success and number of treatments necessary for laser tattoo removal, provided the medical practitioner is using a Q-switched Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) laser incorporating selective photothermolysis with six weeks between treatments.<ref name=\"KD\">{{cite journal|last1=Kirby|first1=William|last2=Desai|first2=Alpesh|last3=Desai|first3=Tejas|last4=Kartono|first4=Francisca|last5=Geeta|first5=Patel|title=The Kirby-Desai Scale|journal=The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology|date=21 December 2016|volume=2|issue=3|pages=32\u201337|pmc=2923953|issn=1941-2789|pmid=20729941}}</ref>\n\nThe Kirby-Desai Scale assigns numerical values to six parameters:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kirby |first1=William |title=The Kirby-Desai Scale A Proposed Scale to Assess Tattoo-removal Treatments |journal=The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=32\u201337 |pmc=2923953 |year=2009 |pmid=20729941 }}</ref> skin type, location, color, amount of ink, scarring or tissue change, and layering. Parameter scores are then added to yield a combined score that will show the estimated number of treatments needed for successful tattoo removal. Experts recommend that the Kirby-Desai scale be used by all laser practitioners prior to starting tattoo removal treatment to help determine the number of treatments required for tattoo removal and as a predictor of the success of the laser tattoo removal treatments.<ref name=\"KD\" /> Prior to 2009, clinicians had no scientific basis by which to estimate the number of treatments needed to remove a tattoo and the use of this scale is now standard practice in laser tattoo removal.\n\nCertain colors have proved more difficult to remove than others. In particular, this occurs when treated with the wrong wavelength of laser light is used. Some have postulated that the reason for slow resolution of green ink in particular is due to its significantly smaller molecular size relative to the other colours.<ref>Konstadinos Siomos; Raymond T. Bailey; Frank R. Cruickshank; Michael J. Murphy; Q-switched laser removal of tattoos: a clinical and spectroscopic investigation of the mechanism. Proc. SPIE 2623, Medical Applications of Lasers III, 40 (Jan 1996); {{DOI|10.1117/12.230314}}</ref> Consequently, green ink tattoos may require treatment with 755&nbsp;nm light but may also respond to 694&nbsp;nm, 650&nbsp;nm and 1064&nbsp;nm. Multiple wavelengths of light may be needed to remove colored inks.\n\nOne small Greek study showed that the R20 method\u2014four passes with the laser, twenty minutes apart\u2014caused more breaking up of the ink than the conventional method without more scarring or adverse effects. However, this study was performed on a very small patient population (12 patients total), using the weakest of the QS lasers, the 755&nbsp;nm Alexandrite laser. One of the other main problems with this study was the fact that more than half of the 18 tattoos removed were not professional and amateur tattoos are always easier to remove. Proof of concept studies are underway, but many laser experts advise against the R20 method using the more modern and powerful tattoo removal lasers available at most offices as an increase in adverse side effects including scarring and dischromia is likely. Patients should inquire about the laser being used if the R20 treatment method is offered by a facility as it is usually only offered by clinics that are using the weak 755&nbsp;nm Alexandrite as opposed to the more powerful and versatile devices that are more commonly used. Moreover, dermatologists offering the R20 method should inform patients that it just one alternative to proven protocols and is not a gold standard treatment method to remove tattoos.\n\nMultiple pass treatment methods (R20, as mentioned above, and R0) have generally shown to carry a greater risk of side effects, due to the increased amount of energy used in treatment. One caveat to this, however, is incorporating a perfluorodecalin (PFD) patch into the protocol<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lsm.22399</ref>. A PFD patch utilizes a clear silicone gel patch, with a small amount of PFD liquid applied to the treatment area immediately before each pass of laser application, and conducting the passes in rapid succession. The combination of the patch and liquid reduce the epidermal scatter, which can limit the predicted side effects typically seen in aggressive laser tattoo removal treatments (hyper and hypopigmentation, blistering, etc)<ref>https://www.laserskinsurgery.com/f/Tattoo_Publication_040919.pdf</ref>. Additionally, the liquid reduces the laser frosting very quickly, allowing for faster re-treatment, limiting the time of treatment while still improving efficacy. Early studies have been performed to indicate improved clearance with the use of this patch in 3-4 passes, in a single session, utilizing more energy than typically allowable with a traditional treatment methodology<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lsm.22106</ref>. All these physical properties of the patch work to substantially reduce the total number of laser treatment required for ink clearance. While the PFD patch is currently FDA cleared for use with all pico and nanosecond domain lasers and wavelengths, it is only cleared for Fitzpatrick Skin Types I-III. Early studies have shown anecdotally that there isn't necessarily increased risks with Fitzpatrick Skin Types IV-VI, though still not FDA cleared as an indication<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lsm.23022</ref>.\n\n===Factors contributing to the success of laser tattoo removal===\nThere are a number of factors that determine how many treatments will be needed and the level of success one might experience. Age of tattoo, ink density, color and even where the tattoo is located on the body, all play an important role in how many treatments will be needed for complete removal. However, a rarely recognized factor of tattoo removal is the role of the client\u2019s immune response.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Costandi |first1=Mo |title=Tats Off: Targeting the Immune System May Lead to Better Tattoo Removal |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tats-off-targeting-the-immune-system-may-lead-to-better-tattoo-removal/ |website=Scientific American |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref> The normal process of tattoo removal is fragmentation followed by [[phagocytosis]] which is then drained away via the [[Lymphatic system|lymphatics]]. Consequently, it is the inflammation resulting from the actual laser treatment and the natural stimulation of the hosts\u2019 immune response that ultimately results in removal of tattoo ink; thus variations in results are enormous.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Dustin|title=Factors Determining Tattoo Removal Success|url=http://www.falleninktattooremoval.com/2017/02/08/factors-determining-tattoo-removal-success/|publisher=Fallen Ink Tattoo Removal|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Pain management during treatment===\nLaser tattoo removal is uncomfortable - many patients say it is worse than getting the tattoo. The pain is often described to be similar to that of hot oil on the skin, or a \"snap\" from an elastic band.  Depending on the patient's [[pain threshold]], and while some patients may forgo anesthesia  altogether, most patients will require some form of local anesthesia. Pre-treatment might include the application of an anesthetic cream under occlusion for 45 to 90 minutes or cooling by ice or cold air prior to the laser treatment session. A better method is complete anesthesia which can be administered locally by injections of 1% to 2% lidocaine with epinephrine.\n\nA technique which helps to reduce the pain sensation felt by patients has been described by MJ Murphy<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = Michael J. | year = 2014 | title = A novel, simple and efficacious technique for tattoo removal resulting in less pain using the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser | journal = Lasers in Medical Science | volume = 29| issue = 4| pages = 1445\u20131447| doi=10.1007/s10103-014-1542-3| pmid = 24584904 }}</ref> He used a standard microscope glass slide pressed against the tattooed skin and fired the laser through the glass. This technique may represent a simplest and effective method to reduce the pain sensation when treating small tattoos.\n\n===Post-treatment considerations===\nImmediately after laser treatment, a slightly elevated, white discoloration with or without the presence of punctuate bleeding is often observed. This white color change is thought to be the result of rapid, heat-formed steam or gas, causing dermal and epidermal vacuolization.  Pinpoint bleeding represents vascular injury from photoacoustic waves created by the laser's interaction with tattoo pigment. Minimal edema and [[erythema]] of adjacent normal skin usually resolve within 24 hours. Subsequently, a crust appears over the entire tattoo, which sloughs off at approximately two weeks post-treatment. As noted above, some tattoo pigment may be found within this crust. Post-operative wound care consists of simple wound care and a non-occlusive dressing. Since the application of laser light is sterile there is no need for topical antibiotics. Moreover, topical antibiotic ointments can cause allergic reactions and should be avoided. Fading of the tattoo will be noted over the next eight weeks and re-treatment energy levels can be tailored depending on the clinical response observed.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Kirby, William; Desai, Alpesh; Desai, Tejas; Kartona, Francisa.  Tattoo Removal Techniques: Effective Tattoo Removal Treatments - Part 2, Skin and Aging, October, 2005.</ref>\n\n===Side effects and complications===\nAbout half of the patients treated with Q-switched lasers for tattoo removal will show some transient changes in the normal skin pigmentation. These changes usually resolve in 6 to 12 months but may rarely be permanent.<ref name=\"drtattoff.com\">{{cite journal|author1=Kirby, William|author2=Koriakos, Angie|author3=Desai, Alpesh|author4=Desai, Tejas|title=Undesired Pigmentary Alterations Associated with Q-Switched Laser Tattoo Removal|journal=Skin and Aging|date=August 2010|url=http://www.drtattoff.com/images/articles/Undesired-Pigmentary-Alterations-Associated-with-Q-Switched-Laser-Tattoo-Removal-Skin-and-Aging-Aug-2010.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928125102/http://drtattoff.com/images/articles/Undesired-Pigmentary-Alterations-Associated-with-Q-Switched-Laser-Tattoo-Removal-Skin-and-Aging-Aug-2010.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-09-28}}</ref>\n\nHyperpigmentation is related to the patient's [[skin tone]], with skin types IV, V and VI more prone regardless of the wavelength used. Twice daily treatment with hydroquinones and broad-spectrum sunscreens usually resolves the hyperpigmentation within a few months, although, in some patients, resolution can be prolonged.<ref name=\"drtattoff.com\"/>\n\nHypopigmentation is more commonly observed in darker skin tones. It is more likely to occur with higher fluence and more frequent treatments. Sometimes lighter skin exhibits hypopigmentation after a series of treatments. Allowing more time between treatments reduces chances of hypopigmentation. Since it is more likely to see hypopigmentation after multiple treatments, some practitioners suggest waiting a few additional weeks, after a few sessions. Usually treatment stops until hypopigmentation resolves in a matter of months.\n\nTransient textural changes are occasionally noted but often resolve within a few months; however, permanent textural changes and scarring very rarely occur. If a patient is prone to pigmentary or textural changes, longer treatment intervals are recommended. Additionally, if a blister or crust forms following treatment, it is imperative that the patient does not manipulate this secondary skin change. Early removal of a blister of crust increases the chances of developing a scar. Additionally, patients with a history of hypertrophic or keloidal scarring need to be warned of their increased risk of scarring.\n\nLocal allergic responses to many tattoo pigments have been reported, and allergic reactions to tattoo pigment after Q-switched laser treatment are also possible.  Rarely, when yellow cadmium sulfide is used to \"brighten\" the red or yellow portion of a tattoo, a photoallergic reaction may occur.  The reaction is also common with red ink, which may contain cinnabar (mercuric sulphide).   Erythema, pruritus, and even inflamed nodules, verrucose papules, or granulomas may present. The reaction will be confined to the site of the red/yellow ink.  Treatment consists of strict sunlight avoidance, sunscreen, interlesional steroid injections, or in some cases, surgical removal. Unlike the destructive modalities described, Q-switched lasers mobilize the ink and may generate a systemic allergic response. Oral antihistamines and anti-inflammatory steroids have been used to treat allergic reactions to tattoo ink.\n\nStudies of various tattoo pigments have shown that a number of pigments (most containing iron oxide or titanium dioxide) change color when irradiated with Q-switched laser energy. Some tattoo colors including flesh tones, light red, white, peach and light brown containing pigments as well as some green and blue tattoo pigments, changed to black when irradiated with Q-switched laser pulses. The resulting gray-black color may require more treatments to remove. If tattoo darkening does occur, after 8 weeks the newly darkened tattoo can be treated as if it were black pigment.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Kirby, William|author2=Kaur, Ravneet Ruby|author3=Desai, Alpesh|title=Paradoxical darkening and removal of pink tattoo ink|journal=Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology|date=June 2010|url=http://www.drtattoff.com/images/articles/Paradoxical-darkening-and-removal-of-pink-tattoo-ink-JOCD-Jun-2010.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928101437/http://drtattoff.com/images/articles/Paradoxical-darkening-and-removal-of-pink-tattoo-ink-JOCD-Jun-2010.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nVery rarely, non Q-switched laser treatments, like CO2 or Argon lasers, which are very rarely offered these days, can rupture blood vessels and aerosolize tissue requiring a plastic shield or a cone device to protect the laser operator from tissue and blood contact. Protective eyewear may be worn if the laser operator chooses to do so.\n\nWith the mechanical or salabrasion method of tattoo removal, the incidence of scarring, pigmentary alteration (hyper- and hypopigmentation), and ink retention are extremely high.<ref>Kirby, William, Desai, Alpesh, Desai, Tejas, Kartona, Francisa, Tattoo Removal Techniques: Effective Tattoo Removal Treatments - Part 1, Skin and Aging, September, 2005</ref>\n\nThe use of Q-switched lasers could very rarely produce the development of large [[bulla (dermatology)|bulla]].  However, if  patients follow post care directions to elevate, rest, and apply intermittent icing, it should minimize the chances of bulla and other adverse effects. In addition, health care practitioners should contemplate the use of a cooling device during the tattoo removal procedure. While  the infrequent bulla development is a possible side effect of Q-switched laser tattoo removal, if treated appropriately and quickly by the health care practitioner, it is unlikely that long term consequences would ensue.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Kirby W|author2=Kartono F|author3=Desai A|author4=Kaur R|author5=Desai T|title=Treatment of Large Bulla Formation after Tattoo Removal with a Q-Switched Laser|journal=Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology|date=January 2010|url=http://www.jcadonline.com/2210/treatment-of-large-bulla-formation-after-tattoo-removal-with-a-q-switched-laser/#more-2210}}</ref>\n\n===Risks===\nAlthough laser treatment is well known and often used to remove tattoos, unwanted side effects of laser tattoo removal include the possibility of discoloration of the skin such as hypopigmentation (white spots, more common in darker skin) and hyperpigmentation (dark spots) as well as textural changes - these changes are usually not permanent when the Nd:YAG is used but it is much more likely with the use of the 755&nbsp;nm Alexandrite, the 694&nbsp;nm Ruby and the R20 method. Very rarely, burns may result in scarring but this usually only occurs when patients do not care for the treated area properly.  Occasionally, \"paradoxical darkening\" of a tattoo may occur, when a treated tattoo becomes darker instead of lighter.  This occurs most often with white ink, flesh tones, pink, and cosmetic make-up tattoos.<ref>S. Varma, et al. Tattoo ink darkening of a yellow tattoo after Q-switched laser treatment.

This has not yet been reported in vivo but has been shown in laboratory tests. Laser removal of traumatic tattoos may similarly be complicated depending on the substance of the pigmenting material. In one reported instance, the use of a laser resulted in the ignition of embedded particles of firework debris.<ref>Taylor Charles R., \"Laser ignition of traumatically embedded firework debris,\" ''Lasers in Surgery and Medicine'', 1998, volume 22, p. 157\u2013158</ref>\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = E.

An important period in Russian history was the [[Tsardom of Russia]] from 1547 until 1721 where many Russian cultural peculiarities emerged and developed. At different periods in Russian history, the culture of Western Europe also exerted strong influences over Russian citizens. During the era of the [[Russian Empire]] which existed from 1721 to 1917, the Tsar's title was abolished and the rulers of Russia were called [[Emperor]]s.

Epic Russian [[bylina]]s are also an important part of [[Slavic mythology]]. The oldest bylinas of [[Kiev]]an cycle were actually recorded mostly in the [[Northwestern Federal District|Russian North]], especially in [[Karelia]], where most of the [[Finnish people|Finnish]] national epic [[Kalevala]] was recorded as well. \n[[File:Ivanbilibin.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Buyan]]'' by [[Ivan Bilibin]]]]\n\nMany [[Russian fairy tale]]s and bylinas were adapted for [[Russian animation]]s, or for feature movies by famous directors like [[Aleksandr Ptushko]] (''[[Ilya Muromets (film)|Ilya Muromets]]'', ''[[Sadko (film)|Sadko]]'') and [[Aleksandr Rou]] (''[[Morozko]]'', ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]''). Some Russian poets, including [[Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov|Pyotr Yershov]] and [[Leonid Filatov]], created a number of well-known poetical interpretations of classical Russian fairy tales, and in some cases, like that of [[Alexander Pushkin]], also created fully original fairy tale poems that became very popular.\n\nFolklorists today consider the 1920s the [[Soviet Union]]'s golden age of folklore. The struggling new government, which had to focus its efforts on establishing a new administrative system and building up the nation's backwards economy, could not be bothered with attempting to control literature, so studies of folklore thrived. There were two primary trends of folklore study during the decade: the [[Russian formalism|formalist]] and [[Finland|Finnish]] schools. Formalism focused on the artistic form of ancient byliny and faerie tales, specifically their use of distinctive structures and poetic devices.<ref>Felix J. Oinas, \"Folklore and Politics in the Soviet Union,\" Slavic Review 32 (1973): 45.</ref> The Finnish school was concerned with connections amongst related legends of various Eastern European regions.

One crowned head looks to Europe and reflects the Western European element in Russian culture, the other looks to Asia and symbolizes the Asian Oriental element in Russia. Both are connected to a big third crown. Russian culture is connected with European and Asian cultures and was influenced by both.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lukin20030328.pdf|title=Russia between East and West: Perceptions and Reality|last=Lukin|first=Alexander|date=2003}}</ref>]]\nOnce [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power and put his [[first five-year plan]] into motion in 1928, the Soviet government began to criticize and censor folklore studies. Stalin and the Soviet regime repressed folklore, believing that it supported the old tsarist system and a capitalist economy. They saw it as a reminder of the backward Russian society that the [[Bolsheviks]] were working to surpass.<ref>Felix J. Oinas, \"The Political Uses and Themes of Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" Journal of the Folklore Institute 12 (1975): 157.</ref> To keep folklore studies in check and prevent \"inappropriate\" ideas from spreading amongst the masses, the government created the RAPP \u2013 the [[Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]]. The RAPP specifically focused on censoring fairy tales and children's literature, believing that fantasies and \"bourgeois nonsense\" harmed the development of upstanding Soviet citizens. Fairy tales were removed from bookshelves and children were encouraged to read books focusing on nature and science.<ref>William B. Husband, \"\u2019Correcting Nature's Mistakes\u2019: Transforming the Environment and Soviet Children's Literature, 1828\u20131941,\" Environmental History 11 (2006): 304.</ref> RAPP eventually increased its levels of censorship and became the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] in 1932.\n[[File:Viktor Vasnetsov - \u0411\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0438 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Bogatyrs]]'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]. The three [[epic hero|hero]]es of [[bylina|Russian mythology]]: (l-r) [[Dobrynya Nikitich]], [[Ilya Muromets]] and [[Alyosha Popovich]]]]\n\nIn order to continue researching and analyzing folklore, intellectuals needed to justify its worth to the Communist regime. Otherwise, collections of folklore, along with all other literature deemed useless for the purposes of Stalin's Five Year Plan, would be an unacceptable realm of study. In 1934, [[Maksim Gorky]] gave a speech to the Union of Soviet Writers arguing that folklore could, in fact, be consciously used to promote Communist values. Apart from expounding on the artistic value of folklore, he stressed that traditional legends and fairy tales showed ideal, community-oriented characters, which exemplified the model Soviet citizen.<ref>Grimes Farrer, \"The Soviet Folktale as an Ideological Strategy for Survival in International Business Relations,\" Studies in Soviet Thought 13 (1973): 55.</ref> Folklore, with many of its conflicts based on the struggles of a labor-oriented lifestyle, was relevant to Communism as it could not have existed without the direct contribution of the working classes.<ref>Oinas, \"Folklore and Politics,\" 47.</ref> Also, Gorky explained that folklore characters expressed high levels of optimism, and therefore could encourage readers to maintain a positive mindset, especially as their lives changed with the further development of Communism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nYuri Sokolov, the head of the folklore section of the Union of Soviet Writers also promoted the study of folklore by arguing that folklore had originally been the oral tradition of the working people, and consequently could be used to motivate and inspire collective projects amongst the present-day proletariat.<ref>Frank J. Miller, \"The Image of Stalin in Soviet Russian Folklore,\" Russian Review 39 (1980): 51.</ref> Characters throughout traditional Russian folktales often found themselves on a journey of self-discovery, a process that led them to value themselves not as individuals, but rather as a necessary part of a common whole. The attitudes of such legendary characters paralleled the mindset that the Soviet government wished to instill in its citizens.<ref>[[Margaret Schlauch]], \"Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" Science and Society 8 (1944): 213.</ref> He also pointed out the existence of many tales that showed members of the working class outsmarting their cruel masters, again working to prove folklore's value to Soviet ideology and the nation's society at large.<ref>Schlauch, \"Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" 215.</ref>\nConvinced by Gorky and Sokolov's arguments, the Soviet government and the Union of Soviet Writers began collecting and evaluating folklore from across the country. The Union handpicked and recorded particular stories that, in their eyes, sufficiently promoted the collectivist spirit and showed the Soviet regime's benefits and progress. It then proceeded to redistribute copies of approved stories throughout the population. Meanwhile, local folklore centers arose in all major cities.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 160.</ref> Responsible for advocating a sense of Soviet nationalism, these organizations ensured that the media published appropriate versions of Russian folktales in a systematic fashion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[File:Ilya Repin - Sadko - Google Art Project levels adjustment 2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Sadko]] in the Underwater Tsardom'' by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\nApart from circulating government-approved fairy tales and byliny that already existed, during Stalin's rule authors parroting appropriate Soviet ideologies wrote Communist folktales and introduced them to the population. These contemporary folktales combined the structures and motifs of the old byliny with contemporary life in the Soviet Union. Called noviny, these new tales were considered the [[renaissance]] of the Russian epic.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 169.</ref> Folklorists were called upon to teach modern folksingers the conventional style and structure of the traditional byliny. They also explained to the performers the appropriate types of Communist ideology that should be represented in the new stories and songs<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 161.</ref> As the performers of the day were often poorly educated, they needed to obtain a thorough understanding of [[Marxist]] ideology before they could be expected to impart folktales to the public in a manner that suited the Soviet government. Besides undergoing extensive education, many folk performers traveled throughout the nation in order to gain insight into the lives of the working class, and thus communicate their stories more effectively.<ref>Miller, \"Image of Stalin,\" 54.</ref>  Due to their crucial role in spreading Communist ideals throughout the Soviet Union, eventually some of these performers became highly valued members of Soviet society. A number of them, despite their illiteracy, were even elected as members of the Union of Soviet Writers.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 164.</ref>\n\nThese new Soviet fairy tales and folk songs primarily focused on the contrasts between a miserable life in old tsarist Russia and an improved one under Stalin's leadership.<ref>Oinas, \"Folklore and Politics,\" 48.</ref> Their characters represented identities for which Soviet citizens should strive, exemplifying the traits of the \"[[New Soviet Man]].\"<ref>Farrer, \"Ideological Strategy,\" 57.</ref> The heroes of Soviet tales were meant to portray a transformed and improved version of the average citizen, giving the reader a clear goal for an ideal community-oriented self that the future he or she was meant to become. These new folktales replaced [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] with technology, and supernatural forces with Stalin.<ref>Schlauch, \"Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" 220.</ref> Instead of receiving essential advice from a mythical being, the protagonist would be given advice from omniscient Stalin. If the character followed Stalin's divine advice, he could be assured success in all his endeavors and a complete transformation into the \"New Soviet Man.\"<ref>Miller, \"Image of Stalin,\" 55.</ref> The villains of these contemporary fairy tales were the [[Whites]] and their leader Idolisce, \"the most monstrous idol,\" who was the equivalent of the tsar. Descriptions of the Whites in noviny mirrored those of the [[Tartars]] in byliny.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 166.</ref> In these new stories, the Whites were incompetent, stagnant capitalists, while the Soviet citizens became invincible heroes.<ref>Husband, \"Transforming the Environment,\" 305.\"</ref>\n\nOnce Stalin died in March 1953, folklorists of the period quickly abandoned the new folktales. Written by individual authors and performers, noviny did not come from the oral traditions of the working class. Consequently, today they are considered pseudo-folklore, rather than genuine Soviet (or Russian) folklore.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 172.</ref> Without any true connection to the masses, there was no reason noviny should be considered anything other than contemporary literature.

The age of the great novelists was over and short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres of Russian literature for the next several decades, which later became known as the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]]. Previously dominated by [[Realism (arts)|realism]], Russian literature came under strong influence of [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] in the years between 1893 and 1914. Leading writers of this age include [[Valery Bryusov]], [[Andrei Bely]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Alexander Blok|Aleksandr Blok]], [[Nikolay Gumilev]], [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]], [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Osip Mandelstam]], [[Marina Tsvetaeva]], [[Leonid Andreyev]], [[Ivan Bunin]], and [[Maxim Gorky]].\n\nFollowing the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], Russian cultural life was left in chaos. Some prominent writers, like [[Ivan Bunin]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]] left the country, while a new generation of talented writers joined together in different organizations with the aim of creating a new and distinctive [[working-class culture]] appropriate for the new state, the [[Soviet Union]]. Throughout the 1920s writers enjoyed broad tolerance. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with Joseph Stalin's policy of [[socialist realism]]. After his death the restrictions on literature were eased, and by the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring official guidelines. The leading authors of the Soviet era included [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Yevgeny Zamiatin]], [[Isaac Babel]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Ilf and Petrov]], [[Yury Olesha]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Boris Pasternak]], [[Michail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov|Mikhail Sholokhov]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], and [[Andrey Voznesensky]].\n\nThe Soviet era was also the golden age of Russian [[science fiction]], that was initially inspired by western authors and enthusiastically developed with the success of [[Soviet space program]]. Authors like [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], [[Kir Bulychov]], [[Ivan Yefremov]], [[Alexander Belayev]] enjoyed mainstream popularity at the time. An important theme of Russian literature has always been the [[Russian soul]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]]<br /><small>(1799\u20131837)</small>\n! align=center |[[Gogol]]<br /><small>(1809\u20131852)</small>\n! align=center |[[Turgenev]]<br /><small>(1818\u20131883)</small>\n! align=center |[[Dostoevsky]]<br /><small>(1821\u20131881)</small>\n! align=center |[[Tolstoy]]<br /><small>(1828\u20131910)</small>\n! align=center |[[Chekhov]]<br /><small>(1860\u20131904)</small>\n! align=center |[[Mikhail Bulgakov|Bulgakov]]<br /><small>(1891\u20131940)</small>\n|-\n| align=left | [[File:Kiprensky Pushkin.jpg|136px]] || align=\"left\" | [[File:\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0413\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044f.jpg|129px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Turgenev Perov scanned.JPG|126px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Dostoevskij 1872.jpg|127px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Ilya Efimovich Repin (1844-1930) - Portrait of Leo Tolstoy (1887).jpg|111px]] || align=\"left\" | [[File:ChekhovGl 1.jpg|123px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Bu\u0142hakow.jpg|118px]]\n|}\n\n===Philosophy===\n{{Main|List of Russian philosophers}}\nSome Russian writers, like [[Tolstoy]] and [[Dostoyevsky]], are known also as philosophers, while many more authors are known primarily for their philosophical works. [[Russian philosophy]] blossomed since the 19th century, when it was defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group includes [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the early founders of [[eurasianism]].\n\nIn its further developments, Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in [[creativity]], society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism|cosmos]] and religion were other primary subjects. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], [[Vladimir Lossky]] and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]. In the 20th century Russian philosophy became dominated by [[Marxism]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]<br /><small>(1814\u20131876)</small>\n! align=center |[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]]<br /><small>(1842\u20131921)</small>\n! align=center |[[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]]<br /><small>(1853\u20131900)</small>\n! align=center |[[Lev Shestov|Shestov]]<br /><small>(1866\u20131938)</small>\n! align=center |[[Nikolai Berdyaev|Berdyaev]]<br /><small>(1874\u20131948)</small>\n|-\n| align=left | [[File:Bakunin.png|137px]] || align=\"left\" | [[File:Peter Kropotkin circa 1900.jpg|128px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:V.Solovyov.jpg|116px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Si L\u00e9on Chestov noong 1927.jpg|126px]] || align=\"left\" |[[File:Berdiayev001.jpg|center|frameless|184x184px]]\n|}\n\n===Humour===\n{{Main|Russian humour|Russian jokes|Chastushka}}\nRussia owes much of its wit to the great flexibility and richness of the Russian language, allowing for puns and unexpected associations. As with any other nation, its vast scope ranges from lewd jokes and silly [[word play]] to [[political satire]].\n\n[[Russian jokes]], the most popular form of [[Russian humour]], are short fictional stories or dialogues with a [[punch line]]. Russian joke culture features a series of categories with fixed and highly familiar settings and characters. Surprising effects are achieved by an endless variety of plots. Russians love jokes on topics found everywhere in the world, be it politics, spouse relations, or [[mother-in-law joke|mothers-in-law]].\n\n[[Chastushka]], a type of traditional [[Russian poetry]], is a single [[quatrain]] in [[trochee|trochaic]] [[tetrameter]] with an \"abab\" or \"abcb\" [[rhyme scheme]]. Usually [[humor]]ous, [[satire|satirical]], or ironic in nature, chastushkas are often put to music as well, usually with [[balalaika]] or [[accordion]] accompaniment. The rigid, short structure (and to a lesser degree, the type of humor these use) parallels [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]]. The name originates from the Russian word ''\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0301\u0442\u044c'', meaning \"to speak fast.\"\n\n==Visual arts==\nRussian visual artworks are similar in style with the ones from other eastern Slavic countries, like [[Ukraine]] or [[Belarus]].\n\nAs early as the 12th and 13th centuries Russia had its national masters who were free of all foreign influence, i. e. that of the Greeks on the one hand, and on the other hand that of the Lombard master-masons called in Andrei Georgievich to build the Uspensky (Assumption) Cathedral in the city of Vladimir. Russia's relations with the Greek world were hampered by the Mongol invasion, and it is to the isolation arising from this that we must attribute the originality of Slavo-Russian ornamentation, which has a character of its own, quite unlike the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] and its derivative, the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nKremlin Tower Clock, 1913, House of Faberge, Russia, rhodonite, silver, enamel, emeralds, sapphires - Cleveland Museum of Art - DSC08964.JPG|Kremlin Tower Clock; 1913; [[rhodonite]], silver, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], emeralds, sapphires; by House of [[Faberg\u00e9]]; Cleveland Museum of Art\nPeter Carl Faberg\u00e9 - Tea Set - 1966.500 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Russian tea set; by [[Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9]]; made before 1896; silver gilt and opaque cloisonne enamel; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] (USA)\nFedor I.

Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers. Since the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], for several centuries Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by the [[Byzantine architecture]], until the [[Fall of Constantinople]]. Apart from fortifications ([[kremlin]]s), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were [[Orthodox church]]es, with their many domes, often gilded or brightly painted. [[Aristotle Fioravanti]] and other Italian architects brought [[Renaissance]] trends into Russia. The 16th century saw the development of unique [[tent-like church]]es culminating in [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]]. By that time the [[onion dome]] design was also fully developed. In the 17th century, the \"fiery style\" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and [[Yaroslavl]], gradually paving the way for the [[Naryshkin baroque]] of the 1690s. After [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great reforms]] had made Russia much closer to Western culture, the change of the architectural styles in the country generally followed that of Western Europe.\n\nThe 18th-century taste for [[rococo]] architecture led to the splendid works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. During the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], the city of [[Saint Petersburg]] was transformed into an outdoor museum of [[Neoclassical architecture]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the Byzantine and [[Russian Revival]] style (this corresponds to [[Gothic Revival]] in Western Europe). Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]] ([[Fyodor Shekhtel]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Moisei Ginzburg]] and [[Victor Vesnin]]), and the [[Stalinist architecture|Stalin Empire style]] ([[Boris Iofan]]). After Stalin's death a new Soviet leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], condemned the \"excesses\" of the former architectural styles, and in the late Soviet era the architecture of the country was dominated by plain [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created the large massives of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright architecture. After the end of the [[Soviet Union]] the situation improved. Many churches demolished in the Soviet times were rebuilt, and this process continues along with the restoration of various historical buildings destroyed in [[World War II]]. As for the original architecture, there is no more any common style in modern Russia, though [[International style (architecture)|International style]] has a great influence.\n\nSome notable Russian buildings include:\n*[[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] | [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)]] | [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] | [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir]] | [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] | [[Cathedral of the Archangel]] | [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] | [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] | [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] | [[Kazan Kremlin]] | [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] | [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]] | [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] | [[Sukharev Tower]] | [[Menshikov Tower]] | [[Moscow Manege]] | [[Narva Triumphal Gate]] | [[Kolomenskoye]] | [[Peterhof Palace]] | [[Gatchina]] | [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] | [[Solovetsky Monastery]] | [[Kunstkamera]] | [[Russian Museum]] | [[Catherine Palace]] | [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] | [[Winter Palace]] | [[Simonov Monastery]] | [[Novodevichy Convent]] | [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] | [[Tatlin's Tower]] | [[Palace of the Soviets]] | [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)]] | [[All-Soviet Exhibition Centre]] | [[Ostankino Tower]] | [[Triumph-Palace]] | [[White House of Russia]]\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nSaint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod.jpg|[[Cathedral of St. Sophia, Novgorod|Cathedral of St. Sophia]] in [[Novgorod]]\nMoscow July 2011-7a.jpg|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] from [[Moscow]]\nDormition Cathedral, Moscow.jpg|[[Cathedral of the Dormition|Dormition Cathedral]] in Moscow\n0 4707b 6549aa91 spasskaya.jpg|[[Spasskaya Tower]] from [[Moscow Kremlin]]\nMoscou.- La Cath\u00e9drale Basile-le-Bienheureux.jpg|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow\nSaint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|[[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] from [[Saint Petersburg]]\nMari\u00e4-Entschlafens-Kathedrale und Brunnenkapelle.jpg|Assumption Cathedral in [[Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius]]\nKizhi churches.jpg|The 22-dome Transfiguration Church from [[Kizhi Island]]\n\"\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\".jpg|[[Church of the Savior on Blood]] in Saint Petersburg\nWinter Palace Panorama 4.jpg|The [[Winter Palace]] from Saint Petersburg\n\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 - panoramio (114).jpg|[[GUM (department store)|GUM]] in Moscow\nMoscow BolshayaYakimanka43 X10.jpg|[[Igumnov House]] in Moscow\nRizhskaya.jpg|[[Moscow Rizhsky railway station|Rizhsky station]] from Moscow\n\u0418\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0441\u043a. \u0414\u043e\u043c \u0428\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u044b\u0445 1.JPG|Lace house in [[Irkutsk]]\n\"\u0423\u0441\u0430\u0434\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u0412.\u041f. \u0421\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430\", \u0444\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0434 \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0438.jpg|Sukachev's Cottage from Irkutsk\nKazan.

A set of Matryoshka dolls consist of a wooden figure which can be pulled apart to reveal another figure of the same sort but somewhat smaller inside. It has in turn another somewhat smaller figure inside, and so on. The number of nested figures is usually six or more. The shape is mostly cylindrical, rounded at the top for the head and tapered towards the bottom, but little else. The dolls have no extremities, (except those that are painted). The true artistry is in the painting of each doll, which can be extremely elaborate. The theme is usually peasant girls in traditional dress, but can be almost anything; for instance, fairy tales or Soviet leaders.\n\nOther forms of Russian handicraft include [[khokhloma]], [[Dymkovo toy]], [[Gzhel (ceramics)|gzhel]], [[Zhostovo painting]], [[Filimonov toy]]s, [[Pysanka|pisanka]], [[Pavlovo Posad shawl]], [[Rushnyk]], and [[palekh miniature|palekh]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\n\u0410\u0437\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u04301.jpg|A [[Gzhel]] [[samovar]]\nFile:Poup\u00e9es russes.JPG|Matryoshka dolls in a market\nFile:Russian-Matroshka.jpg|[[Matryoshka doll]]\n\u0425\u043e\u0445\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0435.jpg|A Khokhloma painting on a cutting board\nFile:\u0414\u044b\u043c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0433. \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432 (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c).JPG|[[Dymkovo toys]] in a store\nFile:Podnos.jpg|A [[Zhostovo painting]]\nFile:Toy of Filimonovo 02.jpg|Some [[Filimonovo toy]]s\nFile:Pyssanka1.jpg|[[Pysanka]]s\nFile:Russian lacquered box - Suzdal.png|Lacquered box with a [[Kholuy miniature]], depicting the town of [[Suzdal]]\n\u041f\u0435\u0440\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c.jpg|A Permogorsk painting on wood\nFile:\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u0448\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438.jpg|[[Rushnyk]], old traditional Russian weaving style.

Many religious homes in Russia have icons hanging on the wall in the ''krasny ugol'', the \"red\" or \"beautiful\" corner (see [[Icon Corner]]). There is a rich history and elaborate [[religious symbolism]] associated with icons. In Russian churches, the [[nave]] is typically separated from the [[sanctuary]] by an ''[[iconostasis]]'' (Russian ''ikonost\u00e1s'') a wall of icons. Icon paintings in Russia attempted to help people with their prayers without idolizing the figure in the painting. The most comprehensive collection of Icon art is found at the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].<ref name=icons>[http://www.geographia.com/russia/rusart01.htm Russian Art and Architecture]</ref>\n\nThe use and making of icons entered [[Kievan Rus']] following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman ([[Byzantine]]) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians\u2014notably [[Andrei Rublev]] and [[Dionisius]]\u2014widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when [[Simon Ushakov]]'s painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.\n\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, changes in liturgy and practice instituted by [[Patriarch Nikon]] resulted in a split in the Russian Orthodox Church. The traditionalists, the persecuted \"Old Ritualists\" or \"[[Old Believers]]\", continued the traditional stylization of icons, while the State Church modified its practice. From that time icons began to be painted not only in the traditional stylized and nonrealistic mode, but also in a mixture of Russian stylization and Western European realism, and in a Western European manner very much like that of Catholic religious art of the time. The [[Stroganov School|Stroganov movement]] and the icons from [[Nevyansk]] rank among the last important schools of Russian icon-painting.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMeister der Schule von Nowgorod 002.jpg|Icon of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]; circa 1360; by the [[Novgorod School]]; [[Louvre]] (Paris)\nFile:Angelsatmamre-trinity-rublev-1410.jpg|''[[Trinity (Andrei Rublev)|Holy Trinity, Hospitality of Abraham]]''; by [[Andrei Rublev]]; c. 1411; tempera on panel; 1.1 x 1.4 m (4&nbsp;ft 8 in x 3&nbsp;ft 8{{fraction|3|4}} in); [[Tretyakov Gallery]] (Moscow)\n\u0421\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u00ab\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u00bb, \u00ab\u0422\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0446\u044b\u00bb \u0438 \u00ab\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u00bb..jpg|A three-leaved fold with the image of the \"Annunciation\", \"Trinity\" and \"Presentation\"; the end of the 17th century; temperaon wood; 13 x 7.3&nbsp;cm; [[National Art Museum of Azerbaijan]] ([[Baku]])\n\u0418\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u00ab\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0427\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446 (\u0414\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\". \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c XVIII \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430, \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434. \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e, \u043b\u0435\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0441, \u0442\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430..jpg|Icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker (Dvorischensky); 18th century; wood, gesso & tempera; [[Ryabushinsky Museum of Icons and Paintings]] ([[Moscow]]) \n</gallery>\n\n===Lubok===\n{{main|Lubok}}\nA lubok (plural ''Lubki'', [[Cyrillic]]: {{lang-ru|\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0301\u043a, \u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0301\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430}}) is a Russian [[popular print]], characterized by simple [[graphics]] and [[narrative]]s derived from literature, religious stories and popular tales. Lubki prints were used as decoration in houses and inns. Early examples from the late 17th and early 18th centuries were [[woodcut]]s, then [[engraving]]s or [[etching]]s were typical, and from the mid-19th century [[lithography]]. They sometimes appeared in series, which might be regarded as predecessors of the modern [[comic strip]]. Cheap and simple books, similar to [[chapbook]]s,<ref>Lyons, Martyn. \"Books: A Living History\".

Notable portrait painters from the Academy include [[Ivan Argunov]], [[Fyodor Rokotov]], [[Dmitry Levitzky]], and [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]].\n\nIn the early 19th century, when [[neoclassicism]] and [[romantism]] flourished, famous academic artists focused on mythological and Biblical themes, like [[Karl Briullov]] and [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]].\n\n===Realist painting===\n{{main|Peredvizhniki|Russian artists}}\n[[File:Hovhannes Aivazovsky - The Ninth Wave - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Ninth Wave]]'' by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]]]]\n[[File:Ilja Jefimowitsch Repin 009.jpg|thumb|''[[Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks]]'' by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\n[[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] came into dominance in the 19th century. The realists captured Russian identity in landscapes of wide rivers, forests, and [[birch]] clearings, as well as vigorous genre scenes and robust portraits of their contemporaries. Other artists focused on [[social criticism]], showing the conditions of the poor and caricaturing authority; [[Social realism|critical realism]] flourished under the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], with some artists making the circle of human suffering their main theme. Others focused on depicting dramatic moments in Russian history. The ''[[Peredvizhniki]]'' (''wanderers'') group of artists broke with Russian Academy and initiated a school of art liberated from Academic restrictions. Leading realists include [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]] and [[Ilya Repin]].\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century and on, many Russian artists developed their own unique styles, neither realist nor avante-garde. These include [[Boris Kustodiev]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], [[Mikhail Vrubel]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]]. Many works by the [[Peredvizhniki]] group of artists have been highly sought after by collectors in recent years. Russian art auctions during [[Russian Art Week]] in London have increased in demand and works have been sold for record breaking prices.\n\n===Russian avant-garde===\n{{Main|Russian avant-garde|List of Russian artists|Russian Futurism}}\nThe [[Russian avant-garde]] is an umbrella term used to define the large, influential wave of [[modernist art]] that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related, art movements that occurred at the time; namely [[neo-primitivism]], [[suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[rayonism]], and [[Russian Futurism|futurism]]. Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Pavel Filonov]] and [[Marc Chagall]]. The Russian avant-garde reached its creative and popular height in the period between the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and 1932, at which point the revolutionary ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of [[socialist realism]].\n\nIn the 20th century many Russian artists made their careers in Western Europe, forced to emigrate by the Revolution. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Naum Gabo]] and others spread their work, ideas, and the impact of Russian art globally.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nGlass (Larionov 1912).jpg|''The glass''; by [[Mikhail Larionov]]; 1912; oil on canvas; 104 \u00d7 97&nbsp;cm (40.9 \u00d7 38.1 in.); [[Solomon R.

The instrument for this was created just days before the October Revolution, known as Proletkult, an abbreviation for \"Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii\" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Alexander Bogdanov]]. Initially, [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. Although Marxist in character, the Proletkult gained the disfavor of many party leaders, and by 1922 it had declined considerably. It was eventually disbanded by Stalin in 1932. ''De facto'' restrictions on what artists could paint were abandoned by the late 1980s.\n\nHowever, in the late Soviet era many artists combined innovation with [[socialist realism]] including [[Ernst Neizvestny]], [[Ilya Kabakov]], [[Mikhail Shemyakin]], [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]], [[Erik Bulatov]], and [[Vera Mukhina]]. They employed techniques as varied as [[primitivism]], [[hyperrealism]], [[grotesque]], and [[abstraction]]. Soviet artists produced works that were furiously patriotic and [[anti-fascist]] in the 1940s. After the [[Great Patriotic War]] Soviet sculptors made multiple monuments to the war dead, marked by a great restrained solemnity.\n\n==Performance arts==\n\n=== Russian folk music ===\n{{main|Russian traditional music}}\n[[File:Balalaika.JPG|thumb|A [[balalaika]]]]\nRussians have distinctive traditions of [[Music of Russia#Folk music|folk music]].

Folk music had great influence on the Russian classical composers, and in modern times it is a source of inspiration for a number of popular [[folk band]]s, most prominent being [[Golden Ring (band)|Golden Ring]], [[Ural's Nation Choir]], [[Lyudmila Zykina]]. [[Ethnic Russian music|Russian folk songs]], as well as patriotic songs of the [[Music of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]], constitute the bulk of repertoire of the world-renowned [[Alexandrov ensemble|Red Army choir]] and other popular Russian ensembles.\n\n=== Russian folk dance ===\n{{main|Russian folk dances}}\nRussian folk dance ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0422\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446 ) can generally be broken up into two main types of dances [[Khorovod]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434), a circular game type dance where the participants hold hands, sing, and the action generally happens in the middle of circle, and Plyaska ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u041f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043a\u0430 or \u041f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439), a circular dance for men and women that increases in diversity and tempo, according to Bob Renfield, considered to be the preeminent scholar on the topic.

Popular Russian rock groups include [[Mashina Vremeni]], [[Slot (band)|Slot]], [[DDT (band)|DDT]], [[Aquarium (group)|Aquarium]], [[Alisa (Russian band)|Alisa]], [[Kino (band)|Kino]], [[Nautilus Pompilius (band)|Nautilus Pompilius]], [[Aria (band)|Aria]], [[Grazhdanskaya Oborona]], [[Splean]] and [[Korol i Shut]]. At the same time [[Russian pop]] music developed from what was known in the Soviet times as ''estrada'' into full-fledged industry, with some performers gaining international recognition, like [[t.A.T.u.]] in the West, who have been said to be the most influential artists to ever come out of Russia, or [[Vitas]] in China.

On different days in June there are major celebrations of the end of the school year, when graduates from schools and universities traditionally swim in the city fountains; the local varieties of these public events include [[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] tradition in [[Saint Petersburg]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Religion in Russia}}\n[[File:Moscow - Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.jpg|thumb|254x254px|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]].|alt=]]\n[[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and Judaism are Russia's traditional religions, deemed part of Russia's \"historical heritage\" in a law passed in 1997.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bell, I|title=Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPP3ti4hysUC&pg=PA47|accessdate=27 December 2007|isbn=9781857431377}}</ref>\nEstimates of believers widely fluctuate among sources, and some reports put the number of non-believers in Russia as high as 16\u201348% of the population.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zuckerman, P|title=Atheism: Contemporary Rates and Patterns, chapter in The Cambridge Companion to Atheism, ed. by Michael Martin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=}}</ref> [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]] is the dominant religion in Russia.<ref name=relig>{{cite web|title=Religion In Russia|publisher=Embassy of the Russian Federation|url=http://www.russianembassy.org/RUSSIA/religion.htm|accessdate=27 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219055545/http://www.russianembassy.org/RUSSIA/religion.htm|archivedate=19 December 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 95% of the registered Orthodox parishes belong to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] while there are a number of [[Religion in Russia#Registered religious organizations|smaller Orthodox Churches]].<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ru:\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0445, \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u041f\u043e \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u044b|date=December 2006|url=http://www.religare.ru/article36302.htm|accessdate=27 December 2007|language=ru}}</ref> However, the vast majority of Orthodox believers do not attend church on a regular basis.

The early Cossack communities emerged in the 14th century, the first, among others, were the [[Don Cossacks]]. Other Cossack communities that have played an important role in Russia's history and culture are the [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Kuban Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Volga Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks|Transbaikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Cossacks defended the Russian borders and expanded Russia's territory. The regions of the large Cossack communities enjoyed many freedoms in [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsarist Russia]].

Along with ice hockey and basketball, football is one of the most popular sports in modern Russia. In recent years, Russian football, which downgraded in 1990-s, has experienced a revival. Russian clubs (such as [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], [[Zenit St Petersburg]], [[Lokomotiv Moscow]], and [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]) are becoming increasingly successful on the European stage (CSKA and Zenit winning the [[UEFA Cup]] in 2005 and 2008 respectively). The [[Russian national football team]] reached the semi-finals of [[Euro 2008]], losing only to eventual champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. The nation also hosted the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]] as well as the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] at which the national team lost in the Quarterfinals 4\u20132 on penalty kicks to [[Croatia]], their best ever finish as an independent nation.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Martial arts===\n{{Main|Russian martial arts}}\nRussia has an extensive history of martial arts. Some of its best-known forms include the [[Russian fist fighting|fistfight]], [[Sambo(martial art)|Sambo]], and [[Systema]] with its derivatives [[Ryabko's Systema]] and [[Retuinskih's System ROSS]]. Undefeated lightweight [[UFC]] champion [[Khabib Nurmagomedov]] is from [[Makhachkala]] and was called by President Vladimir Putin following his victory over [[Conor McGregor]].\n\n==National symbols==\n{{main|Cultural icons of Russia|Flag of Russia|Coat of arms of Russia|National anthem of Russia|Russian Bear|Mother Russia}}\n\n===State symbols===\nState symbols of Russia include the [[Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]], combined with [[Coat of arms of Moscow|St. George]] of Moscow in the [[Russian coat of arms]]; these symbols date from the time of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. The [[Russian flag]] appeared in the late [[Tsardom of Russia]] period and became widely used during the era of the [[Russian Empire]]. The current [[Russian national anthem]] shares its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics (many Russians of older generations don't know the new lyrics and sing the old ones). The [[Russian Empire|Russian imperial]] [[motto]] ''God is with us'' and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] motto ''Proletarians of all countries, unite!'' are now obsolete and no new motto has been officially introduced to replace them. The [[Hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. Soviet [[Red Star]]s are also encountered, often on [[military equipment]] and [[war memorial]]s. The Soviet [[Red Banner]] is still honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.\n[[File:Russian-Matroshka2.jpg|thumb|Dissected [[Matryoshka doll]]]]\n\n===Unofficial symbols===\nThe [[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of Russia, while the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are main Russia's architectural symbols. [[Cheburashka]] is a mascot of [[Russia at the Olympics|Russian national Olympic team]]. [[Saint Mary|Mary]], [[Saint Nicholas]], [[Saint Andrew]], [[Saint George]], [[Saint Alexander Nevsky]], [[Saint Sergius of Radonezh]], [[Saint Seraphim of Sarov]] are Russia's patron saints. [[Chamomile]] is a flower that Russians often associate with their [[Motherland]], while [[birch]] is a [[national tree]]. The [[Russian bear]] is an animal often associated with Russia, though this image has Western origins and Russians themselves do not consider it as a special symbol. The native Russian national personification is \"\u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c\" [[Mother Motherland]] (the statue of it located on the Mamay hill \"\u041c\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0432 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\" in Volgograd /former Stalingrad/), called [[Mother Russia]] at the West.\n\n==Tourism==\n{{Main|Tourism in Russia}}\nTourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet times, first inner tourism and then international tourism as well. Rich cultural heritage and great natural variety place Russia among the [[World Tourism rankings|most popular tourist destinations]] in the world. The country [[List of World Heritage Sites in Russia|contains 29 UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s, while many more are on UNESCO's tentative lists.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/state=ru Tentative Lists]</ref> Major tourist routes in Russia include a travel around the Golden Ring of ancient cities, cruises on the big rivers like [[Volga]], and long journeys on the famous [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. Diverse regions and ethnic cultures of Russia offer many different food and souvenirs, and show a great variety of traditions, like Russian [[banya (sauna)|banya]], Tatar [[Sabantuy]], or Siberian [[shamanist]] rituals.\n\n===Cultural tourism===\n[[File:Grand Cascade in Peterhof 01.jpg|thumb|Grand Cascade in [[Peterhof Palace]], nicknamed ''Russian Versailles'', a popular tourist destination in [[Saint Petersburg]].]]\nMost popular tourist destinations in Russia are Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]], the current and the former capitals of the country and great cultural centers, recognized as [[World Cities]]. Moscow and Saint Petersburg feature such world-renowned museums as [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], famous theaters like [[Bolshoi Theater|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Theater|Mariinsky]], ornate churches like [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], impressive fortifications like [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], beautiful squares like [[Red Square]] and [[Palace Square]], and streets like [[Tverskaya Street|Tverskaya]] and [[Nevsky Prospect]]. Rich palaces and parks of extreme beauty are found in the former [[Template:Imperial palaces in Russia|imperial residences]] in suburbs of Moscow ([[Kolomenskoye]], [[Tsaritsyno Park|Tsaritsyno]]) and Saint Petersburg ([[Petergof|Peterhof]], [[Strelna]], [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], [[Gatchina Palace|Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk Palace]], [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). Moscow contains a great variety of impressive Soviet-era buildings along with [[Moscow International Business Center|modern skyscrapers]], while Saint Petersburg, nicknamed ''Venice of the North'', boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, channels and [[Bridges in Saint Petersburg|bridges]].\n\n[[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]], shows a unique mix of Christian [[Russians|Russian]] and Muslim [[Tatars|Tatar]] cultures. The city has registered a brand ''The Third Capital of Russia'', though a number of other major Russian cities compete for this status, like [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]], all being major cultural centers with rich history and prominent architecture. [[Veliky Novgorod]], [[Pskov]] and the cities of Golden Ring ([[Vladimir (city)|Vladimir]], [[Yaroslavl]], [[Kostroma]] and others) have at best preserved the architecture and the spirit of ancient and medieval [[Rus (name)|Rus']], and also are among the main tourist destinations. Many [[List of castles in Russia|old fortifications]] (typically [[Kremlin]]s), [[List of Russian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] and [[Russian Orthodox Church|churches]] are scattered throughout Russia, forming its unique cultural landscape both in big cities and in remote areas.\n\n===Resorts and nature tourism===\n[[File:Dombai 3760 Gornolyzhnie Trassy.jpg|thumb|The [[ski resort]] at [[Dombay]], [[Western Caucasus]].]]\nThe warm subtropical [[Black Sea]] coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea [[resort]]s, like [[Sochi]], known for its beaches and wonderful nature. At the same time Sochi can boast a number of major [[ski resort]]s, like [[Krasnaya Polyana]]; the city is the host of [[2014 Winter Olympics]] and the [[2014 Winter Paralympics]]. The mountains of the [[Northern Caucasus]] contain many other popular [[ski resort]]s, like [[Dombay, Karachay\u2013Cherkess Republic|Dombay]] in [[Karachay\u2013Cherkessia]].\n\nThe most famous natural tourist destination in Russia is [[Lake Baikal]], named ''the Blue Eye of Siberia''. This unique lake, oldest and deepest in the world, has crystal-clean waters and is surrounded by [[taiga]]-covered mountains.\n\nOther popular natural destinations include [[Kamchatka]] with its [[volcano]]es and [[geyser]]s, [[Karelia]] with its many lakes and [[granite]] rocks, [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] with its snowy mountains and [[Tyva]] with its wild steppes.\n\n{{World Heritage Sites in Russia|state=uncollapsed}}\n\n==Timeline==\n* 1801\u20131914: Upper classes in Russia spoke French, some even as their first language, which became a problem during Napoleon's invasion; the Golden Age of [[Russian poetry]] and [[Russian literature]]; Pushkin & Lermontov.\n* early 20th century: Silver Age of Russian literature\n* 1917\u20131932: Constructivism.

An important period in Russian history was the [[Tsardom of Russia]] from 1547 until 1721 where many Russian cultural peculiarities emerged and developed. At different periods in Russian history, the culture of Western Europe also exerted strong influences over Russian citizens. During the era of the [[Russian Empire]] which existed from 1721 to 1917, the Tsar's title was abolished and the rulers of Russia were called [[Emperor]]s. Since the [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|reforms of Peter the Great]] (reigned 1682-1725) in the Russian Empire, for two centuries Russian culture largely developed in the general context of [[European culture]] rather than pursuing its own unique ways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/europe-and-the-world/knowledge-transfer/martin-aust-russia-and-europe-1547-1917|title=Russia and Europe (1547\u20131917) Russia and Europe (1547\u20131917)|last=Aust|first=Martin|website=EGO(http://www.ieg-ego.eu)|language=en|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref> The situation changed in the 20th century, when the distinctive [[Communism|Communist ideology]] imported from Europe became a major factor in the [[Soviet culture|culture of the Soviet Union]], where Russia, in the form of the [[Russian SFSR]], was the largest and leading part.

Epic Russian [[bylina]]s are also an important part of [[Slavic mythology]]. The oldest bylinas of [[Kiev]]an cycle were actually recorded mostly in the [[Northwestern Federal District|Russian North]], especially in [[Karelia]], where most of the [[Finnish people|Finnish]] national epic [[Kalevala]] was recorded as well. \n[[File:Ivanbilibin.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Buyan]]'' by [[Ivan Bilibin]]]]\n\nMany [[Russian fairy tale]]s and bylinas were adapted for [[Russian animation]]s, or for feature movies by famous directors like [[Aleksandr Ptushko]] (''[[Ilya Muromets (film)|Ilya Muromets]]'', ''[[Sadko (film)|Sadko]]'') and [[Aleksandr Rou]] (''[[Morozko]]'', ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]''). Some Russian poets, including [[Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov|Pyotr Yershov]] and [[Leonid Filatov]], created a number of well-known poetical interpretations of classical Russian fairy tales, and in some cases, like that of [[Alexander Pushkin]], also created fully original fairy tale poems that became very popular.\n\nFolklorists today consider the 1920s the [[Soviet Union]]'s golden age of folklore. The struggling new government, which had to focus its efforts on establishing a new administrative system and building up the nation's backwards economy, could not be bothered with attempting to control literature, so studies of folklore thrived. There were two primary trends of folklore study during the decade: the [[Russian formalism|formalist]] and [[Finland|Finnish]] schools. Formalism focused on the artistic form of ancient byliny and faerie tales, specifically their use of distinctive structures and poetic devices.<ref>Felix J. Oinas, \"Folklore and Politics in the Soviet Union,\" Slavic Review 32 (1973): 45.</ref> The Finnish school was concerned with connections amongst related legends of various Eastern European regions.

The image of the crowned double eagle and the central crown which is connected with the other two crowns is often used as a pictorial example of Russias cultural nature. One crowned head looks to Europe and reflects the Western European element in Russian culture, the other looks to Asia and symbolizes the Asian Oriental element in Russia. Both are connected to a big third crown. Russian culture is connected with European and Asian cultures and was influenced by both.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lukin20030328.pdf|title=Russia between East and West: Perceptions and Reality|last=Lukin|first=Alexander|date=2003}}</ref>]]\nOnce [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power and put his [[first five-year plan]] into motion in 1928, the Soviet government began to criticize and censor folklore studies. Stalin and the Soviet regime repressed folklore, believing that it supported the old tsarist system and a capitalist economy. They saw it as a reminder of the backward Russian society that the [[Bolsheviks]] were working to surpass.<ref>Felix J. Oinas, \"The Political Uses and Themes of Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" Journal of the Folklore Institute 12 (1975): 157.</ref> To keep folklore studies in check and prevent \"inappropriate\" ideas from spreading amongst the masses, the government created the RAPP \u2013 the [[Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]]. The RAPP specifically focused on censoring fairy tales and children's literature, believing that fantasies and \"bourgeois nonsense\" harmed the development of upstanding Soviet citizens. Fairy tales were removed from bookshelves and children were encouraged to read books focusing on nature and science.<ref>William B. Husband, \"\u2019Correcting Nature's Mistakes\u2019: Transforming the Environment and Soviet Children's Literature, 1828\u20131941,\" Environmental History 11 (2006): 304.</ref> RAPP eventually increased its levels of censorship and became the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] in 1932.\n[[File:Viktor Vasnetsov - \u0411\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0438 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Bogatyrs]]'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]. The three [[epic hero|hero]]es of [[bylina|Russian mythology]]: (l-r) [[Dobrynya Nikitich]], [[Ilya Muromets]] and [[Alyosha Popovich]]]]\n\nIn order to continue researching and analyzing folklore, intellectuals needed to justify its worth to the Communist regime. Otherwise, collections of folklore, along with all other literature deemed useless for the purposes of Stalin's Five Year Plan, would be an unacceptable realm of study. In 1934, [[Maksim Gorky]] gave a speech to the Union of Soviet Writers arguing that folklore could, in fact, be consciously used to promote Communist values. Apart from expounding on the artistic value of folklore, he stressed that traditional legends and fairy tales showed ideal, community-oriented characters, which exemplified the model Soviet citizen.<ref>Grimes Farrer, \"The Soviet Folktale as an Ideological Strategy for Survival in International Business Relations,\" Studies in Soviet Thought 13 (1973): 55.</ref> Folklore, with many of its conflicts based on the struggles of a labor-oriented lifestyle, was relevant to Communism as it could not have existed without the direct contribution of the working classes.<ref>Oinas, \"Folklore and Politics,\" 47.</ref> Also, Gorky explained that folklore characters expressed high levels of optimism, and therefore could encourage readers to maintain a positive mindset, especially as their lives changed with the further development of Communism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nYuri Sokolov, the head of the folklore section of the Union of Soviet Writers also promoted the study of folklore by arguing that folklore had originally been the oral tradition of the working people, and consequently could be used to motivate and inspire collective projects amongst the present-day proletariat.<ref>Frank J. Miller, \"The Image of Stalin in Soviet Russian Folklore,\" Russian Review 39 (1980): 51.</ref> Characters throughout traditional Russian folktales often found themselves on a journey of self-discovery, a process that led them to value themselves not as individuals, but rather as a necessary part of a common whole. The attitudes of such legendary characters paralleled the mindset that the Soviet government wished to instill in its citizens.<ref>[[Margaret Schlauch]], \"Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" Science and Society 8 (1944): 213.</ref> He also pointed out the existence of many tales that showed members of the working class outsmarting their cruel masters, again working to prove folklore's value to Soviet ideology and the nation's society at large.<ref>Schlauch, \"Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" 215.</ref>\nConvinced by Gorky and Sokolov's arguments, the Soviet government and the Union of Soviet Writers began collecting and evaluating folklore from across the country. The Union handpicked and recorded particular stories that, in their eyes, sufficiently promoted the collectivist spirit and showed the Soviet regime's benefits and progress. It then proceeded to redistribute copies of approved stories throughout the population. Meanwhile, local folklore centers arose in all major cities.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 160.</ref> Responsible for advocating a sense of Soviet nationalism, these organizations ensured that the media published appropriate versions of Russian folktales in a systematic fashion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[File:Ilya Repin - Sadko - Google Art Project levels adjustment 2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Sadko]] in the Underwater Tsardom'' by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\nApart from circulating government-approved fairy tales and byliny that already existed, during Stalin's rule authors parroting appropriate Soviet ideologies wrote Communist folktales and introduced them to the population. These contemporary folktales combined the structures and motifs of the old byliny with contemporary life in the Soviet Union. Called noviny, these new tales were considered the [[renaissance]] of the Russian epic.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 169.</ref> Folklorists were called upon to teach modern folksingers the conventional style and structure of the traditional byliny. They also explained to the performers the appropriate types of Communist ideology that should be represented in the new stories and songs<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 161.</ref> As the performers of the day were often poorly educated, they needed to obtain a thorough understanding of [[Marxist]] ideology before they could be expected to impart folktales to the public in a manner that suited the Soviet government. Besides undergoing extensive education, many folk performers traveled throughout the nation in order to gain insight into the lives of the working class, and thus communicate their stories more effectively.<ref>Miller, \"Image of Stalin,\" 54.</ref>  Due to their crucial role in spreading Communist ideals throughout the Soviet Union, eventually some of these performers became highly valued members of Soviet society. A number of them, despite their illiteracy, were even elected as members of the Union of Soviet Writers.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 164.</ref>\n\nThese new Soviet fairy tales and folk songs primarily focused on the contrasts between a miserable life in old tsarist Russia and an improved one under Stalin's leadership.<ref>Oinas, \"Folklore and Politics,\" 48.</ref> Their characters represented identities for which Soviet citizens should strive, exemplifying the traits of the \"[[New Soviet Man]].\"<ref>Farrer, \"Ideological Strategy,\" 57.</ref> The heroes of Soviet tales were meant to portray a transformed and improved version of the average citizen, giving the reader a clear goal for an ideal community-oriented self that the future he or she was meant to become. These new folktales replaced [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] with technology, and supernatural forces with Stalin.<ref>Schlauch, \"Folklore in the Soviet Union,\" 220.</ref> Instead of receiving essential advice from a mythical being, the protagonist would be given advice from omniscient Stalin. If the character followed Stalin's divine advice, he could be assured success in all his endeavors and a complete transformation into the \"New Soviet Man.\"<ref>Miller, \"Image of Stalin,\" 55.</ref> The villains of these contemporary fairy tales were the [[Whites]] and their leader Idolisce, \"the most monstrous idol,\" who was the equivalent of the tsar. Descriptions of the Whites in noviny mirrored those of the [[Tartars]] in byliny.<ref>Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 166.</ref> In these new stories, the Whites were incompetent, stagnant capitalists, while the Soviet citizens became invincible heroes.<ref>Husband, \"Transforming the Environment,\" 305.\"</ref>\n\nOnce Stalin died in March 1953, folklorists of the period quickly abandoned the new folktales. Written by individual authors and performers, noviny did not come from the oral traditions of the working class. Consequently, today they are considered pseudo-folklore, rather than genuine Soviet (or Russian) folklore.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Oinas, \"Political Uses and Themes,\" 172.</ref> Without any true connection to the masses, there was no reason noviny should be considered anything other than contemporary literature. Specialists decided that attempts to represent contemporary life through the structure and artistry of the ancient epics could not be considered genuine folklore.<ref>Miller, \"Image of Stalin,\" 64.</ref> Stalin's name has been omitted from the few surviving pseudo-folktales of the period.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Instead of considering folklore under Stalin a renaissance of the traditional Russian epic, today it is generally regarded as a period of restraint and falsehood.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Russian literature|List of Russian-language poets|List of Russian-language writers}}\n[[Russian literature]] is considered to be among the most influential and developed in the world, with some of the most famous literary works belonging to it.<ref name=\"Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007\"/> Russia's literary history dates back to the 10th century; in the 18th century its development was boosted by the works of [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] and [[Denis Fonvizin]], and by the early 19th century a modern native tradition had emerged, producing some of the greatest writers of all time. This period and the [[Golden Age of Russian Poetry]] began with [[Alexander Pushkin]], considered to be the founder of modern Russian literature and often described as the ''\"Russian Shakespeare\" or the \"Russian Goethe\"''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kelly, C|title=Russian Literature: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions) (Paperback)|publisher=Oxford Paperbacks|isbn=0-19-280144-9|year=2001|url=https://archive.org/details/russianliteratur00kell_0}}</ref> It continued in the 19th century with the poetry of [[Mikhail Lermontov]] and [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], dramas of [[Aleksandr Ostrovsky]] and [[Anton Chekhov]], and the prose of [[Nikolai Gogol]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin]], [[Ivan Goncharov]], [[Aleksey Pisemsky]] and [[Nikolai Leskov]]. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in particular were titanic figures, to the point that many literary critics have described one or the other as the greatest novelist ever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513793/Russian-literature|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=11 April 2008|title=Russian literature; Leo Tolstoy}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=Time Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943893,00.html?promoid=googlep|accessdate=10 April 2008|title=Freaking-Out with Fyodor|author=Otto Friedrich | date=6 September 1971}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1880s Russian literature had begun to change. The age of the great novelists was over and short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres of Russian literature for the next several decades, which later became known as the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]]. Previously dominated by [[Realism (arts)|realism]], Russian literature came under strong influence of [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] in the years between 1893 and 1914. Leading writers of this age include [[Valery Bryusov]], [[Andrei Bely]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Alexander Blok|Aleksandr Blok]], [[Nikolay Gumilev]], [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]], [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Osip Mandelstam]], [[Marina Tsvetaeva]], [[Leonid Andreyev]], [[Ivan Bunin]], and [[Maxim Gorky]].\n\nFollowing the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], Russian cultural life was left in chaos. Some prominent writers, like [[Ivan Bunin]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]] left the country, while a new generation of talented writers joined together in different organizations with the aim of creating a new and distinctive [[working-class culture]] appropriate for the new state, the [[Soviet Union]]. Throughout the 1920s writers enjoyed broad tolerance. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with Joseph Stalin's policy of [[socialist realism]]. After his death the restrictions on literature were eased, and by the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring official guidelines. The leading authors of the Soviet era included [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Yevgeny Zamiatin]], [[Isaac Babel]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Ilf and Petrov]], [[Yury Olesha]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Boris Pasternak]], [[Michail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov|Mikhail Sholokhov]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], and [[Andrey Voznesensky]].\n\nThe Soviet era was also the golden age of Russian [[science fiction]], that was initially inspired by western authors and enthusiastically developed with the success of [[Soviet space program]]. Authors like [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], [[Kir Bulychov]], [[Ivan Yefremov]], [[Alexander Belayev]] enjoyed mainstream popularity at the time. An important theme of Russian literature has always been the [[Russian soul]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]]<br /><small>(1799\u20131837)</small>\n! align=center |[[Gogol]]<br /><small>(1809\u20131852)</small>\n! align=center |[[Turgenev]]<br /><small>(1818\u20131883)</small>\n! align=center |[[Dostoevsky]]<br /><small>(1821\u20131881)</small>\n! align=center |[[Tolstoy]]<br /><small>(1828\u20131910)</small>\n! align=center |[[Chekhov]]<br /><small>(1860\u20131904)</small>\n! align=center |[[Mikhail Bulgakov|Bulgakov]]<br /><small>(1891\u20131940)</small>\n|-\n| align=left | [[File:Kiprensky Pushkin.jpg|136px]] || align=\"left\" | [[File:\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0413\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044f.jpg|129px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Turgenev Perov scanned.JPG|126px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Dostoevskij 1872.jpg|127px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Ilya Efimovich Repin (1844-1930) - Portrait of Leo Tolstoy (1887).jpg|111px]] || align=\"left\" | [[File:ChekhovGl 1.jpg|123px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Bu\u0142hakow.jpg|118px]]\n|}\n\n===Philosophy===\n{{Main|List of Russian philosophers}}\nSome Russian writers, like [[Tolstoy]] and [[Dostoyevsky]], are known also as philosophers, while many more authors are known primarily for their philosophical works. [[Russian philosophy]] blossomed since the 19th century, when it was defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group includes [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the early founders of [[eurasianism]].\n\nIn its further developments, Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in [[creativity]], society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism|cosmos]] and religion were other primary subjects. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], [[Vladimir Lossky]] and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]. In the 20th century Russian philosophy became dominated by [[Marxism]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center |[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]<br /><small>(1814\u20131876)</small>\n! align=center |[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]]<br /><small>(1842\u20131921)</small>\n! align=center |[[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]]<br /><small>(1853\u20131900)</small>\n! align=center |[[Lev Shestov|Shestov]]<br /><small>(1866\u20131938)</small>\n! align=center |[[Nikolai Berdyaev|Berdyaev]]<br /><small>(1874\u20131948)</small>\n|-\n| align=left | [[File:Bakunin.png|137px]] || align=\"left\" | [[File:Peter Kropotkin circa 1900.jpg|128px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:V.Solovyov.jpg|116px]]|| align=\"left\" | [[File:Si L\u00e9on Chestov noong 1927.jpg|126px]] || align=\"left\" |[[File:Berdiayev001.jpg|center|frameless|184x184px]]\n|}\n\n===Humour===\n{{Main|Russian humour|Russian jokes|Chastushka}}\nRussia owes much of its wit to the great flexibility and richness of the Russian language, allowing for puns and unexpected associations. As with any other nation, its vast scope ranges from lewd jokes and silly [[word play]] to [[political satire]].\n\n[[Russian jokes]], the most popular form of [[Russian humour]], are short fictional stories or dialogues with a [[punch line]]. Russian joke culture features a series of categories with fixed and highly familiar settings and characters. Surprising effects are achieved by an endless variety of plots. Russians love jokes on topics found everywhere in the world, be it politics, spouse relations, or [[mother-in-law joke|mothers-in-law]].\n\n[[Chastushka]], a type of traditional [[Russian poetry]], is a single [[quatrain]] in [[trochee|trochaic]] [[tetrameter]] with an \"abab\" or \"abcb\" [[rhyme scheme]]. Usually [[humor]]ous, [[satire|satirical]], or ironic in nature, chastushkas are often put to music as well, usually with [[balalaika]] or [[accordion]] accompaniment. The rigid, short structure (and to a lesser degree, the type of humor these use) parallels [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]]. The name originates from the Russian word ''\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0301\u0442\u044c'', meaning \"to speak fast.\"\n\n==Visual arts==\nRussian visual artworks are similar in style with the ones from other eastern Slavic countries, like [[Ukraine]] or [[Belarus]].\n\nAs early as the 12th and 13th centuries Russia had its national masters who were free of all foreign influence, i. e. that of the Greeks on the one hand, and on the other hand that of the Lombard master-masons called in Andrei Georgievich to build the Uspensky (Assumption) Cathedral in the city of Vladimir. Russia's relations with the Greek world were hampered by the Mongol invasion, and it is to the isolation arising from this that we must attribute the originality of Slavo-Russian ornamentation, which has a character of its own, quite unlike the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] and its derivative, the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nKremlin Tower Clock, 1913, House of Faberge, Russia, rhodonite, silver, enamel, emeralds, sapphires - Cleveland Museum of Art - DSC08964.JPG|Kremlin Tower Clock; 1913; [[rhodonite]], silver, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], emeralds, sapphires; by House of [[Faberg\u00e9]]; Cleveland Museum of Art\nPeter Carl Faberg\u00e9 - Tea Set - 1966.500 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Russian tea set; by [[Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9]]; made before 1896; silver gilt and opaque cloisonne enamel; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] (USA)\nFedor I.

Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers. Since the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], for several centuries Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by the [[Byzantine architecture]], until the [[Fall of Constantinople]]. Apart from fortifications ([[kremlin]]s), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were [[Orthodox church]]es, with their many domes, often gilded or brightly painted. [[Aristotle Fioravanti]] and other Italian architects brought [[Renaissance]] trends into Russia. The 16th century saw the development of unique [[tent-like church]]es culminating in [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]]. By that time the [[onion dome]] design was also fully developed. In the 17th century, the \"fiery style\" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and [[Yaroslavl]], gradually paving the way for the [[Naryshkin baroque]] of the 1690s. After [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great reforms]] had made Russia much closer to Western culture, the change of the architectural styles in the country generally followed that of Western Europe.\n\nThe 18th-century taste for [[rococo]] architecture led to the splendid works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. During the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], the city of [[Saint Petersburg]] was transformed into an outdoor museum of [[Neoclassical architecture]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the Byzantine and [[Russian Revival]] style (this corresponds to [[Gothic Revival]] in Western Europe). Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]] ([[Fyodor Shekhtel]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Moisei Ginzburg]] and [[Victor Vesnin]]), and the [[Stalinist architecture|Stalin Empire style]] ([[Boris Iofan]]). After Stalin's death a new Soviet leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], condemned the \"excesses\" of the former architectural styles, and in the late Soviet era the architecture of the country was dominated by plain [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created the large massives of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright architecture. After the end of the [[Soviet Union]] the situation improved. Many churches demolished in the Soviet times were rebuilt, and this process continues along with the restoration of various historical buildings destroyed in [[World War II]]. As for the original architecture, there is no more any common style in modern Russia, though [[International style (architecture)|International style]] has a great influence.\n\nSome notable Russian buildings include:\n*[[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] | [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)]] | [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] | [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir]] | [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] | [[Cathedral of the Archangel]] | [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] | [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] | [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] | [[Kazan Kremlin]] | [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] | [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]] | [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] | [[Sukharev Tower]] | [[Menshikov Tower]] | [[Moscow Manege]] | [[Narva Triumphal Gate]] | [[Kolomenskoye]] | [[Peterhof Palace]] | [[Gatchina]] | [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] | [[Solovetsky Monastery]] | [[Kunstkamera]] | [[Russian Museum]] | [[Catherine Palace]] | [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] | [[Winter Palace]] | [[Simonov Monastery]] | [[Novodevichy Convent]] | [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] | [[Tatlin's Tower]] | [[Palace of the Soviets]] | [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)]] | [[All-Soviet Exhibition Centre]] | [[Ostankino Tower]] | [[Triumph-Palace]] | [[White House of Russia]]\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nSaint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod.jpg|[[Cathedral of St. Sophia, Novgorod|Cathedral of St. Sophia]] in [[Novgorod]]\nMoscow July 2011-7a.jpg|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] from [[Moscow]]\nDormition Cathedral, Moscow.jpg|[[Cathedral of the Dormition|Dormition Cathedral]] in Moscow\n0 4707b 6549aa91 spasskaya.jpg|[[Spasskaya Tower]] from [[Moscow Kremlin]]\nMoscou.- La Cath\u00e9drale Basile-le-Bienheureux.jpg|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow\nSaint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|[[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] from [[Saint Petersburg]]\nMari\u00e4-Entschlafens-Kathedrale und Brunnenkapelle.jpg|Assumption Cathedral in [[Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius]]\nKizhi churches.jpg|The 22-dome Transfiguration Church from [[Kizhi Island]]\n\"\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\".jpg|[[Church of the Savior on Blood]] in Saint Petersburg\nWinter Palace Panorama 4.jpg|The [[Winter Palace]] from Saint Petersburg\n\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 - panoramio (114).jpg|[[GUM (department store)|GUM]] in Moscow\nMoscow BolshayaYakimanka43 X10.jpg|[[Igumnov House]] in Moscow\nRizhskaya.jpg|[[Moscow Rizhsky railway station|Rizhsky station]] from Moscow\n\u0418\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0441\u043a. \u0414\u043e\u043c \u0428\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u044b\u0445 1.JPG|Lace house in [[Irkutsk]]\n\"\u0423\u0441\u0430\u0434\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u0412.\u041f. \u0421\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430\", \u0444\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0434 \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0438.jpg|Sukachev's Cottage from Irkutsk\nKazan.

A set of Matryoshka dolls consist of a wooden figure which can be pulled apart to reveal another figure of the same sort but somewhat smaller inside. It has in turn another somewhat smaller figure inside, and so on. The number of nested figures is usually six or more. The shape is mostly cylindrical, rounded at the top for the head and tapered towards the bottom, but little else. The dolls have no extremities, (except those that are painted). The true artistry is in the painting of each doll, which can be extremely elaborate.

Many religious homes in Russia have icons hanging on the wall in the ''krasny ugol'', the \"red\" or \"beautiful\" corner (see [[Icon Corner]]). There is a rich history and elaborate [[religious symbolism]] associated with icons. In Russian churches, the [[nave]] is typically separated from the [[sanctuary]] by an ''[[iconostasis]]'' (Russian ''ikonost\u00e1s'') a wall of icons. Icon paintings in Russia attempted to help people with their prayers without idolizing the figure in the painting. The most comprehensive collection of Icon art is found at the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].<ref name=icons>[http://www.geographia.com/russia/rusart01.htm Russian Art and Architecture]</ref>\n\nThe use and making of icons entered [[Kievan Rus']] following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman ([[Byzantine]]) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians\u2014notably [[Andrei Rublev]] and [[Dionisius]]\u2014widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when [[Simon Ushakov]]'s painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.\n\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, changes in liturgy and practice instituted by [[Patriarch Nikon]] resulted in a split in the Russian Orthodox Church. The traditionalists, the persecuted \"Old Ritualists\" or \"[[Old Believers]]\", continued the traditional stylization of icons, while the State Church modified its practice. From that time icons began to be painted not only in the traditional stylized and nonrealistic mode, but also in a mixture of Russian stylization and Western European realism, and in a Western European manner very much like that of Catholic religious art of the time. The [[Stroganov School|Stroganov movement]] and the icons from [[Nevyansk]] rank among the last important schools of Russian icon-painting.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMeister der Schule von Nowgorod 002.jpg|Icon of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]; circa 1360; by the [[Novgorod School]]; [[Louvre]] (Paris)\nFile:Angelsatmamre-trinity-rublev-1410.jpg|''[[Trinity (Andrei Rublev)|Holy Trinity, Hospitality of Abraham]]''; by [[Andrei Rublev]]; c. 1411; tempera on panel; 1.1 x 1.4 m (4&nbsp;ft 8 in x 3&nbsp;ft 8{{fraction|3|4}} in); [[Tretyakov Gallery]] (Moscow)\n\u0421\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 c \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u00ab\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u00bb, \u00ab\u0422\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0446\u044b\u00bb \u0438 \u00ab\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u00bb..jpg|A three-leaved fold with the image of the \"Annunciation\", \"Trinity\" and \"Presentation\"; the end of the 17th century; temperaon wood; 13 x 7.3&nbsp;cm; [[National Art Museum of Azerbaijan]] ([[Baku]])\n\u0418\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u00ab\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0427\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446 (\u0414\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\". \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c XVIII \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430, \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434. \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e, \u043b\u0435\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0441, \u0442\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430..jpg|Icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker (Dvorischensky); 18th century; wood, gesso & tempera; [[Ryabushinsky Museum of Icons and Paintings]] ([[Moscow]]) \n</gallery>\n\n===Lubok===\n{{main|Lubok}}\nA lubok (plural ''Lubki'', [[Cyrillic]]: {{lang-ru|\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0301\u043a, \u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0301\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430}}) is a Russian [[popular print]], characterized by simple [[graphics]] and [[narrative]]s derived from literature, religious stories and popular tales. Lubki prints were used as decoration in houses and inns. Early examples from the late 17th and early 18th centuries were [[woodcut]]s, then [[engraving]]s or [[etching]]s were typical, and from the mid-19th century [[lithography]]. They sometimes appeared in series, which might be regarded as predecessors of the modern [[comic strip]]. Cheap and simple books, similar to [[chapbook]]s,<ref>Lyons, Martyn. \"Books: A Living History\".

Notable portrait painters from the Academy include [[Ivan Argunov]], [[Fyodor Rokotov]], [[Dmitry Levitzky]], and [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]].\n\nIn the early 19th century, when [[neoclassicism]] and [[romantism]] flourished, famous academic artists focused on mythological and Biblical themes, like [[Karl Briullov]] and [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]].\n\n===Realist painting===\n{{main|Peredvizhniki|Russian artists}}\n[[File:Hovhannes Aivazovsky - The Ninth Wave - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Ninth Wave]]'' by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]]]]\n[[File:Ilja Jefimowitsch Repin 009.jpg|thumb|''[[Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks]]'' by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\n[[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] came into dominance in the 19th century. The realists captured Russian identity in landscapes of wide rivers, forests, and [[birch]] clearings, as well as vigorous genre scenes and robust portraits of their contemporaries. Other artists focused on [[social criticism]], showing the conditions of the poor and caricaturing authority; [[Social realism|critical realism]] flourished under the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], with some artists making the circle of human suffering their main theme. Others focused on depicting dramatic moments in Russian history. The ''[[Peredvizhniki]]'' (''wanderers'') group of artists broke with Russian Academy and initiated a school of art liberated from Academic restrictions. Leading realists include [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]] and [[Ilya Repin]].\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century and on, many Russian artists developed their own unique styles, neither realist nor avante-garde. These include [[Boris Kustodiev]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], [[Mikhail Vrubel]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]]. Many works by the [[Peredvizhniki]] group of artists have been highly sought after by collectors in recent years. Russian art auctions during [[Russian Art Week]] in London have increased in demand and works have been sold for record breaking prices.\n\n===Russian avant-garde===\n{{Main|Russian avant-garde|List of Russian artists|Russian Futurism}}\nThe [[Russian avant-garde]] is an umbrella term used to define the large, influential wave of [[modernist art]] that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related, art movements that occurred at the time; namely [[neo-primitivism]], [[suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[rayonism]], and [[Russian Futurism|futurism]]. Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Pavel Filonov]] and [[Marc Chagall]]. The Russian avant-garde reached its creative and popular height in the period between the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and 1932, at which point the revolutionary ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of [[socialist realism]].\n\nIn the 20th century many Russian artists made their careers in Western Europe, forced to emigrate by the Revolution. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Naum Gabo]] and others spread their work, ideas, and the impact of Russian art globally.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nGlass (Larionov, 1912).jpg|''The glass''; by [[Mikhail Larionov]]; 1912; oil on canvas; 104 \u00d7 97&nbsp;cm (40.9 \u00d7 38.1 in.); [[Solomon R.

The instrument for this was created just days before the October Revolution, known as Proletkult, an abbreviation for \"Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii\" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Alexander Bogdanov]]. Initially, [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. Although Marxist in character, the Proletkult gained the disfavor of many party leaders, and by 1922 it had declined considerably. It was eventually disbanded by Stalin in 1932. ''De facto'' restrictions on what artists could paint were abandoned by the late 1980s.\n\nHowever, in the late Soviet era many artists combined innovation with [[socialist realism]] including [[Ernst Neizvestny]], [[Ilya Kabakov]], [[Mikhail Shemyakin]], [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]], [[Erik Bulatov]], and [[Vera Mukhina]]. They employed techniques as varied as [[primitivism]], [[hyperrealism]], [[grotesque]], and [[abstraction]]. Soviet artists produced works that were furiously patriotic and [[anti-fascist]] in the 1940s. After the [[Great Patriotic War]] Soviet sculptors made multiple monuments to the war dead, marked by a great restrained solemnity.\n\n==Performance arts==\n\n=== Russian folk music ===\n{{main|Russian traditional music}}\n[[File:Balalaika.JPG|thumb|A [[balalaika]]]]\nRussians have distinctive traditions of [[Music of Russia#Folk music|folk music]].

Folk music had great influence on the Russian classical composers, and in modern times it is a source of inspiration for a number of popular [[folk band]]s, most prominent being [[Golden Ring (band)|Golden Ring]], [[Ural's Nation Choir]], [[Lyudmila Zykina]]. [[Ethnic Russian music|Russian folk songs]], as well as patriotic songs of the [[Music of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]], constitute the bulk of repertoire of the world-renowned [[Alexandrov ensemble|Red Army choir]] and other popular Russian ensembles.\n\n=== Russian folk dance ===\n{{main|Russian folk dances}}\nRussian folk dance ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0422\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446 ) can generally be broken up into two main types of dances [[Khorovod]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434), a circular game type dance where the participants hold hands, sing, and the action generally happens in the middle of circle, and Plyaska ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u041f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043a\u0430 or \u041f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439), a circular dance for men and women that increases in diversity and tempo, according to Bob Renfield, considered to be the preeminent scholar on the topic.

This was followed by several operas such as ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' in 1842. Russian opera was originally a combination of Russian folk music and [[Italian opera]]. After the [[October revolution]] many opera composers left Russia. Russia's most popular operas include ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'', ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'', ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]'', ''[[Prince Igor]]'', and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]''.\n\n===Modern music===\n{{main|Russian rock|Russian pop}}\n[[File:Berkut flies.jpg|thumb|left|[[heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] band [[Aria (band)|Aria]] is one of the leading [[Russian rock]] performers.]]\nSince the late Soviet times Russia has experienced another wave of [[Western culture|Western cultural]] influence, which led to the development of many previously unknown phenomena in the Russian culture. The most vivid example, perhaps, is the [[Russian rock]] music, which takes its roots both in the Western [[rock and roll]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and in traditions of the [[Bard (Soviet Union)|Russian bards]] of Soviet era, like [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Bulat Okudzhava]]. [[Saint-Petersburg]] (former [[Leningrad]]), [[Yekaterinburg]] (former Sverdlovsk) and [[Omsk]] became the main centers of development of the rock music. Popular Russian rock groups include [[Mashina Vremeni]], [[Slot (band)|Slot]], [[DDT (band)|DDT]], [[Aquarium (group)|Aquarium]], [[Alisa (Russian band)|Alisa]], [[Kino (band)|Kino]], [[Nautilus Pompilius (band)|Nautilus Pompilius]], [[Aria (band)|Aria]], [[Grazhdanskaya Oborona]], [[Splean]] and [[Korol i Shut]]. At the same time [[Russian pop]] music developed from what was known in the Soviet times as ''estrada'' into full-fledged industry, with some performers gaining international recognition, like [[t.A.T.u.]] in the West, who have been said to be the most influential artists to ever come out of Russia, or [[Vitas]] in China.

[[Dziga Vertov]], whose ''kino-glaz'' (\"film-eye\") theory\u2014that the camera, like the human eye, is best used to explore real life\u2014had a huge impact on the development of documentary film making and cinema realism.

Crops of [[rye]], wheat, [[barley]], and [[millet]] provide the ingredients for a plethora of breads, [[pancake]]s, cereals, [[kvass]], beer, and [[vodka]]. Black bread is relatively more popular in Russia compared to the rest of the world. Soups, stews and filled dumplings are very characteristic for Russian cuisine. The most popular soups include [[shchi]], [[borsch]], [[ukha]], [[solyanka]] and [[okroshka]]. [[Smetana (dairy product)|Smetana]] (a heavy [[sour cream]]) is often added to soups and salads. Most popular dumplings are [[pirozhki]], [[pelmeni]], varenyky and Turkic [[Manti (food)|manti]]. One of the most popular are foods are [[blini]], which are like [[syrniki]] native types of Russian pancakes. Furthermore, [[Cutlet]]s (like [[Chicken Kiev]]) and [[shashlyk]] are popular meat dishes, the last one being of [[Tatar]] and [[Caucasus]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} origin respectively. Popular salads include [[Russian Salad]], [[vinaigrette]] and [[Dressed Herring]].

The New Year is the first in calendar and in popularity. Russian New Year traditions resemble those of the Western Christmas, with [[New Year Tree]]s and gifts, and [[Ded Moroz]] ([[Father Frost]]) playing the same role as [[Santa Claus]]. Rozhdestvo (Orthodox Christmas) falls on 7 January, because [[Russian Orthodox Church]] still follows the [[Julian calendar|Julian (old style) calendar]] and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Catholic ones. Another two major Christian holidays are [[Easter|Paskha]] (Easter) and [[Trinity Sunday|Troitsa]] ([[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]]), but there is no need to recognize them as public holidays since they are always celebrated on Sunday.\n\nFurther Russian public holidays include [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]] (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; [[International Women's Day]] (8 March), which combines the traditions of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]; [[International Workers' Day]] (1 May), now renamed ''Spring and Labor Day''; [[Victory Day (9 May)]]; [[Russia Day]] (12 June); and [[Unity Day (Russia)|Unity Day]] (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the [[Poland|Polish]]-[[Lithuania]]n occupation force from Moscow in 1612. The latter is a replacement for the old Soviet holiday celebrating [[October Revolution]] of 1917 (again, it was falling on November because of the difference of calendars). Fireworks and outdoor concerts are common features of all Russian public holidays.\n\n[[File:Victory Day Parade 2008-14.jpg|thumb|left|2008 [[Victory Day (9 May)]] parade on Moscow's [[Red Square]].]]\n[[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] is the second popular holiday in Russia, it commemorates the victory over [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]] and is widely celebrated throughout Russia. A huge [[military parade]], hosted by the [[President of the Russian Federation]], is annually organized in Moscow on [[Red Square]]. Similar parades are organized in all major Russian cities and the cities with the status ''[[Hero city]]'' or ''City of Military Glory''.\n\nOther popular holidays, which are not public, include [[Old New Year]] (New Year according to [[Julian Calendar]] on 1 January), [[Tatiana Day]] (day of Russian students on 25 January), [[Maslenitsa]] (an old pagan holiday a week before the [[Great Lent]]), [[Cosmonautics Day]] (a day of [[Yury Gagarin]]'s first ever human trip into space on 12 April), [[Ivan Kupala Day]] (another pagan [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] holiday on 7 July) and [[The Tale of Peter and Fevronia|Peter and Fevronia Day]] (taking place on 8 July and being the Russian analogue of [[Valentine's Day]], which focuses, however, on the family love and fidelity). On different days in June there are major celebrations of the end of the school year, when graduates from schools and universities traditionally swim in the city fountains; the local varieties of these public events include [[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] tradition in [[Saint Petersburg]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Religion in Russia}}\n[[File:Moscow - Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.jpg|thumb|254x254px|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]].|alt=]]\n[[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and Judaism are Russia's traditional religions, deemed part of Russia's \"historical heritage\" in a law passed in 1997.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bell, I|title=Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPP3ti4hysUC&pg=PA47|accessdate=27 December 2007|isbn=9781857431377}}</ref>\nEstimates of believers widely fluctuate among sources, and some reports put the number of non-believers in Russia as high as 16\u201348% of the population.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zuckerman, P|title=Atheism: Contemporary Rates and Patterns, chapter in The Cambridge Companion to Atheism, ed. by Michael Martin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=}}</ref> [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]] is the dominant religion in Russia.<ref name=relig>{{cite web|title=Religion In Russia|publisher=Embassy of the Russian Federation|url=http://www.russianembassy.org/RUSSIA/religion.htm|accessdate=27 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219055545/http://www.russianembassy.org/RUSSIA/religion.htm|archivedate=19 December 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 95% of the registered Orthodox parishes belong to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] while there are a number of [[Religion in Russia#Registered religious organizations|smaller Orthodox Churches]].<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ru:\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0445, \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u041f\u043e \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u044b|date=December 2006|url=http://www.religare.ru/article36302.htm|accessdate=27 December 2007|language=ru}}</ref> However, the vast majority of Orthodox believers do not attend church on a regular basis.

The early Cossack communities emerged in the 14th century, the first, among others, were the [[Don Cossacks]]. Other Cossack communities that have played an important role in Russia's history and culture are the [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Kuban Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Volga Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks|Transbaikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Cossacks defended the Russian borders and expanded Russia's territory. The regions of the large Cossack communities enjoyed many freedoms in [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsarist Russia]].

Russian players [[Valeri Kharlamov]], [[Sergei Makarov (ice hockey)|Sergei Makarov]], [[Viacheslav Fetisov]] and [[Vladislav Tretiak]] hold four of the six positions on the [[IIHF]] Team of the Century.<ref>[http://www.iihf.com/channels/iihf-world-championship/news/news-singleview-world-championship/article/iihf-centennial-all-star-team.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=552&cHash=3a26b76f60 IIHF Centennial All-Star Team]</ref> As with some other sports, the Russian ice hockey programme suffered after the breakup of the Soviet Union, with Russia enduring a 15-year gold medal drought. At that time many prominent Russian players made their careers in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). In recent years Russia has reemerged as a hockey power, winning back to back gold medals in the [[2008 IIHF World Championships|2008]] and [[2009 IIHF World Championship|2009]] World Championships, and overtaking [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] as the [[2009 IIHF World Ranking|top ranked]] ice hockey team in the world, but then lost to Canada in the quarter-finals of the 2010 Olympics and 2010 World Junior Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/channels/iihf-world-championship-oc09/home/news/news-singleview-world-championship-2009/article/pure-gold-russia-repeats.html?tx_ttnewsbackPid=2717&cHash=f61f91921e|accessdate=11 May 2009|title=Pure gold: Russia repeats!|publisher=[[IIHF]]}}</ref> The [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) was founded in 2008 as a rival of the NHL.\n\n===Bandy===\n[[Bandy]], known in Russian as \"hockey with a ball\" and sometimes informally as \"Russian hockey\" (as opposed to \"Canadian hockey\", an informal name for ice hockey), is another traditionally popular ice sport, with national league games averaging around 3,500 spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rusbandy.ru/content.html?PageID=325|title=XV \u0447\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0445\u043e\u043a\u043a\u0435\u044e \u0441 \u043c\u044f\u0447\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d 2006/07 \u0433.\u0433.

[[Russia national bandy team|The Russian team]] is the reigning world champion since [[2014 Bandy World Championship|the 2014 tournament]], having defended the title in [[2015 Bandy World Championship|2015]].\n\n===Football===\n[[File:RussianBear.JPG|left|thumb|Russian football fans with a gigantic ''Go Russia!'' banner, featuring [[Russian Bear]] on the background of the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]].]]\nDuring the Soviet period, Russia was also a competitive [[Association football|footballing]] nation. Despite having legendary players such as goalkeeper of the century [[Lev Yashin]], the USSR never really managed to assert itself as one of the major forces of international football, although its teams won various championships (such as [[Euro 1960]]) and reached numerous finals (such as [[Euro 1988]]). Along with ice hockey and basketball, football is one of the most popular sports in modern Russia. In recent years, Russian football, which downgraded in 1990-s, has experienced a revival. Russian clubs (such as [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], [[Zenit St Petersburg]], [[Lokomotiv Moscow]], and [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]) are becoming increasingly successful on the European stage (CSKA and Zenit winning the [[UEFA Cup]] in 2005 and 2008 respectively). The [[Russian national football team]] reached the semi-finals of [[Euro 2008]], losing only to eventual champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. The nation also hosted the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]] as well as the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] at which the national team lost in the Quarterfinals 4-2 on penalty kicks to [[Croatia]], their best ever finish as an independent nation.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Martial arts===\n{{Main|Russian martial arts}}\nRussia has an extensive history of martial arts. Some of its best-known forms include the [[Russian fist fighting|fistfight]], [[Sambo(martial art)|Sambo]], and [[Systema]] with its derivatives [[Ryabko's Systema]] and [[Retuinskih's System ROSS]]. Undefeated lightweight [[UFC]] champion [[Khabib Nurmagomedov]] is from [[Makhachkala]] and was called by President Vladimir Putin following his victory over [[Conor McGregor]].\n\n==National symbols==\n{{main|Cultural icons of Russia|Flag of Russia|Coat of arms of Russia|National anthem of Russia|Russian Bear|Mother Russia}}\n\n===State symbols===\nState symbols of Russia include the [[Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]], combined with [[Coat of arms of Moscow|St. George]] of Moscow in the [[Russian coat of arms]]; these symbols date from the time of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. The [[Russian flag]] appeared in the late [[Tsardom of Russia]] period and became widely used during the era of the [[Russian Empire]]. The current [[Russian national anthem]] shares its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics (many Russians of older generations don't know the new lyrics and sing the old ones). The [[Russian Empire|Russian imperial]] [[motto]] ''God is with us'' and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] motto ''Proletarians of all countries, unite!'' are now obsolete and no new motto has been officially introduced to replace them. The [[Hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. Soviet [[Red Star]]s are also encountered, often on [[military equipment]] and [[war memorial]]s. The Soviet [[Red Banner]] is still honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.\n[[File:Russian-Matroshka2.jpg|thumb|Dissected [[Matryoshka doll]]]]\n\n===Unofficial symbols===\nThe [[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of Russia, while the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are main Russia's architectural symbols. [[Cheburashka]] is a mascot of [[Russia at the Olympics|Russian national Olympic team]]. [[Saint Mary|Mary]], [[Saint Nicholas]], [[Saint Andrew]], [[Saint George]], [[Saint Alexander Nevsky]], [[Saint Sergius of Radonezh]], [[Saint Seraphim of Sarov]] are Russia's patron saints. [[Chamomile]] is a flower that Russians often associate with their [[Motherland]], while [[birch]] is a [[national tree]]. The [[Russian bear]] is an animal often associated with Russia, though this image has Western origins and Russians themselves do not consider it as a special symbol. The native Russian national personification is \"\u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c\" [[Mother Motherland]] (the statue of it located on the Mamay hill \"\u041c\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0432 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\" in Volgograd /former Stalingrad/), called [[Mother Russia]] at the West.\n\n==Tourism==\n{{Main|Tourism in Russia}}\nTourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet times, first inner tourism and then international tourism as well. Rich cultural heritage and great natural variety place Russia among the [[World Tourism rankings|most popular tourist destinations]] in the world. The country [[List of World Heritage Sites in Russia|contains 29 UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s, while many more are on UNESCO's tentative lists.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/state=ru Tentative Lists]</ref> Major tourist routes in Russia include a travel around the Golden Ring of ancient cities, cruises on the big rivers like [[Volga]], and long journeys on the famous [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. Diverse regions and ethnic cultures of Russia offer many different food and souvenirs, and show a great variety of traditions, like Russian [[banya (sauna)|banya]], Tatar [[Sabantuy]], or Siberian [[shamanist]] rituals.\n\n===Cultural tourism===\n[[File:Grand Cascade in Peterhof 01.jpg|thumb|Grand Cascade in [[Peterhof Palace]], nicknamed ''Russian Versailles'', a popular tourist destination in [[Saint Petersburg]].]]\nMost popular tourist destinations in Russia are Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]], the current and the former capitals of the country and great cultural centers, recognized as [[World Cities]]. Moscow and Saint Petersburg feature such world-renowned museums as [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], famous theaters like [[Bolshoi Theater|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Theater|Mariinsky]], ornate churches like [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], impressive fortifications like [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], beautiful squares like [[Red Square]] and [[Palace Square]], and streets like [[Tverskaya Street|Tverskaya]] and [[Nevsky Prospect]]. Rich palaces and parks of extreme beauty are found in the former [[Template:Imperial palaces in Russia|imperial residences]] in suburbs of Moscow ([[Kolomenskoye]], [[Tsaritsyno Park|Tsaritsyno]]) and Saint Petersburg ([[Petergof|Peterhof]], [[Strelna]], [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], [[Gatchina Palace|Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk Palace]], [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). Moscow contains a great variety of impressive Soviet-era buildings along with [[Moscow International Business Center|modern skyscrapers]], while Saint Petersburg, nicknamed ''Venice of the North'', boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, channels and [[Bridges in Saint Petersburg|bridges]].\n\n[[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]], shows a unique mix of Christian [[Russians|Russian]] and Muslim [[Tatars|Tatar]] cultures. The city has registered a brand ''The Third Capital of Russia'', though a number of other major Russian cities compete for this status, like [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]], all being major cultural centers with rich history and prominent architecture. [[Veliky Novgorod]], [[Pskov]] and the cities of Golden Ring ([[Vladimir (city)|Vladimir]], [[Yaroslavl]], [[Kostroma]] and others) have at best preserved the architecture and the spirit of ancient and medieval [[Rus (name)|Rus']], and also are among the main tourist destinations. Many [[List of castles in Russia|old fortifications]] (typically [[Kremlin]]s), [[List of Russian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] and [[Russian Orthodox Church|churches]] are scattered throughout Russia, forming its unique cultural landscape both in big cities and in remote areas.\n\n===Resorts and nature tourism===\n[[File:Dombai 3760 Gornolyzhnie Trassy.jpg|thumb|The [[ski resort]] at [[Dombay]], [[Western Caucasus]].]]\nThe warm subtropical [[Black Sea]] coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea [[resort]]s, like [[Sochi]], known for its beaches and wonderful nature. At the same time Sochi can boast a number of major [[ski resort]]s, like [[Krasnaya Polyana]]; the city is the host of [[2014 Winter Olympics]] and the [[2014 Winter Paralympics]]. The mountains of the [[Northern Caucasus]] contain many other popular [[ski resort]]s, like [[Dombay, Karachay\u2013Cherkess Republic|Dombay]] in [[Karachay\u2013Cherkessia]].\n\nThe most famous natural tourist destination in Russia is [[Lake Baikal]], named ''the Blue Eye of Siberia''. This unique lake, oldest and deepest in the world, has crystal-clean waters and is surrounded by [[taiga]]-covered mountains.\n\nOther popular natural destinations include [[Kamchatka]] with its [[volcano]]es and [[geyser]]s, [[Karelia]] with its many lakes and [[granite]] rocks, [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] with its snowy mountains and [[Tyva]] with its wild steppes.\n\n{{World Heritage Sites in Russia|state=uncollapsed}}\n\n==Timeline==\n* 1801\u20131914: Upper classes in Russia spoke French, some even as their first language, which became a problem during Napoleon's invasion; the Golden Age of [[Russian poetry]] and [[Russian literature]]; Pushkin & Lermontov.\n* early 20th century: Silver Age of Russian literature\n* 1917\u20131932: Constructivism.

Though for a long time he played lead roles in tragedy, for which he had a suitably tall and well-proportioned figure, his facial features lacked the flexibility and expressiveness, and his vocal delivery was somewhat too harsh and monotonous, to be considered ideal. However, he won popularity as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Henry IV, Part 1|Hotspur]], and Hastings, and was also admired in the roles of Kitely (''[[Every Man in his Humour]]'', in which he was preferred to Garrick<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), Archer, and Oakly.

On 9 March 1788, after a performance of [[Hamlet]], Smith announced his intention to retire and \"resign the sprightly Charles to abler hands and younger heads\". After a performance of the role on 9 June 1788, he gave his farewell speech, though he did appear once more in 1798 in a benefit performance for his friend [[Thomas King (actor)|Thomas King]], when, 'having grown very lusty, he went through the character with that spirit, ease, and elegance, for which he was unequalled.'<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Personal life and retirement==\nIn his early days, Smith was often distracted from his professional work by his love of fox-hunting.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref> He first married the sister of the [[Earl of Sandwich]], Mrs Kelland Courtnay (a widow), who died in 1762. His elopement to Ireland with Elizabeth Hartley followed. In later life he was remarried, to Miss Newson of [[Leiston]] in Suffolk. (Through the second marriage in the Newson family is traced a relationship to [[Hamlet Watling]], whose brother Edwin also married a daughter of Smith's<ref>Hamlet Watling, 'Suffolk Heraldry & Genealogy in 12 Vols' (MS, [[Ipswich Museum]], Christchurch Mansion) Vol 8.</ref>). Smith died at [[Bury St Edmunds]] on 13 September 1819 in his 89th year. There his elegant figure was remembered as always wearing a white hat edged with green, a blue coat, figured waistcoat, fustian coloured breeches, and gaiters to match, and carrying a gold-headed cane.

Though for a long time he played lead roles in tragedy, for which he had a suitably tall and well-proportioned figure, his facial features lacked the flexibility and expressiveness, and his vocal delivery was somewhat too harsh and monotonous, to be considered ideal. However, he won popularity as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Henry IV, Part 1|Hotspur]], and Hastings, and was also admired in the roles of Kitely (''[[Every Man in his Humour]]'', in which he was preferred to Garrick<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), Archer, and Oakly. It was said that he prided himself on the reflection that he was never called upon to perform in an [[after-piece]], or to pass through a trapdoor in any entrance or exit on the stage.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref>\n\n===Charles Surface===\nSmith's masterpiece was his impersonation of Charles Surface in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', which won the highest praise for originality, boldness of conception, truth, freedom, ease, and gracefulness of action and manner.<ref>'\"Gentleman Smith\", the original Charles Surface', in [[William Hone]] (ed.), ''The Every-Day Book: or, The Guide to the Year'' (London 1825), II, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8CEIAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA260#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 1287\u20131291] (Google).</ref> He is mentioned favourably in [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]'s ''[[Essays of Elia]]'', in the \"Essay upon Old Actors\". On 9 March 1788, after a performance of [[Hamlet]], Smith announced his intention to retire and \"resign the sprightly Charles to abler hands and younger heads\". After a performance of the role on 9 June 1788, he gave his farewell speech, though he did appear once more in 1798 in a benefit performance for his friend [[Thomas King (actor)|Thomas King]], when, 'having grown very lusty, he went through the character with that spirit, ease, and elegance, for which he was unequalled.'<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Personal life and retirement==\nIn his early days, Smith was often distracted from his professional work by his love of fox-hunting.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref> He first married the sister of the [[Earl of Sandwich]], Mrs Kelland Courtnay (a widow), who died in 1762. His elopement to Ireland with Elizabeth Hartley followed. In later life he was remarried, to Miss Newson of [[Leiston]] in Suffolk. (Through the second marriage in the Newson family is traced a relationship to [[Hamlet Watling]], whose brother Edwin also married a daughter of Smith's<ref>Hamlet Watling, 'Suffolk Heraldry & Genealogy in 12 Vols' (MS, [[Ipswich Museum]], Christchurch Mansion) Vol 8.</ref>). Smith died at [[Bury St Edmunds]] on 13 September 1819 in his 89th year. There his elegant figure was remembered as always wearing a white hat edged with green, a blue coat, figured waistcoat, fustian coloured breeches, and gaiters to match, and carrying a gold-headed cane. He was loved by the youngsters of Bury whom he often obliged with sweets from the candy-shop.<ref>W.
