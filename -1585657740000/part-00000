Chapter 7. {{ISBN|1-55750-442-3}}.</ref> Of the 293 ships originally planned, 206 were canceled in 1944 and a further four after being laid down; three were not completed until after the end of World War II.\n\n==History==\n\nThe standard armament for the class was two {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} [[dual purpose gun]]s, four [[Bofors 40 mm|40 mm]] and ten [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]], and three [[American 21 inch torpedo|21 inch (533 mm)]] [[torpedo tube]]s.

The ships had a maximum speed of {{convert|24|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Diagram of US Navy WWII destroyer escort.png|thumb|left]]\n\nThe most notable ship of this class was {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|DE-413|2}}, which gained fame during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], where she, along with several other ships engaged a number of [[cruiser]]s and [[battleship]]s of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in a torpedo attack, where she was sunk after taking several hits.<ref>{{cite video |people=Drooker, Arthur (Writer / Producer) |title=Dogfights: Death of the Japanese Navy |medium=TV series|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]| location=United States|year=2007}}</ref> During this action, ''Samuel B.

In December 1944, the ship lost her mast and radio antennas riding out [[Typhoon Cobra]], which killed 790 sailors (more than were lost at the battles of Midway and Coral Sea combined). Though damaged and unable to radio for help, she was first on the scene to recover 55 of only 93 total rescued from three destroyers which capsized in the heavy seas.\n\nA floating history museum of the destroyer escorts resides in Albany, New York.<ref>[http://www.ussslater.org/ Destroyer Escort Historical Museum]</ref> {{USS|Slater|DE-766|6}} (a related {{sclass-|Cannon|destroyer escort|1}}) is docked during temperate months on the Hudson River in Albany, New York.

Butler'' class''' were [[destroyer escort]]s that originated during [[World War II]]. The [[lead ship]] was {{USS|John C. Butler|DE-339|6}}, commissioned on 31 March 1944. The class was also known as the WGT type from their [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] geared [[Steam turbine|turbine]] drive.<ref>''U.S. Destroyers, an illustrated design history'' by Norman Friedman. Chapter 7. {{ISBN|1-55750-442-3}}.</ref> Of the 293 ships originally planned, 206 were canceled in 1944 and a further four after being laid down; three were not completed until after the end of World War II.\n\n==History==\n\nThe standard armament for the class was two {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} [[dual purpose gun]]s, four [[Bofors 40 mm|40 mm]] and ten [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]], and three [[American 21 inch torpedo|21 inch (533 mm)]] [[torpedo tube]]s. It also carried two [[depth charge]] racks, eight [[K-gun]] depth charge projectors and one [[Hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog projector]] as secondary weapons. The ships had a maximum speed of {{convert|24|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Diagram of US Navy WWII destroyer escort.png|thumb|left]]\n\nThe most notable ship of this class was {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|DE-413|2}}, which gained fame during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], where she, along with several other ships engaged a number of [[cruiser]]s and [[battleship]]s of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in a torpedo attack, where she was sunk after taking several hits.<ref>{{cite video |people=Drooker, Arthur (Writer / Producer) |title=Dogfights: Death of the Japanese Navy |medium=TV series|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]| location=United States|year=2007}}</ref> During this action, ''Samuel B.

In December 1944, the ship lost her mast and radio antennas riding out [[Typhoon Cobra]], which killed 790 sailors (more than were lost at the battles of Midway and Coral Sea combined). Though damaged and unable to radio for help, she was first on the scene to recover 55 of only 93 total rescued from three destroyers which capsized in the heavy seas.\n\nA floating history museum of the destroyer escorts resides in Albany, New York.<ref>[http://www.ussslater.org/ Destroyer Escort Historical Museum]</ref> {{USS|Slater|DE-766|6}} (a related {{sclass-|Cannon|destroyer escort|1}}) is docked during temperate months on the Hudson River in Albany, New York.

The series pits notable historical and pop culture figures, real and fictional, against one another in a [[rap battle]] format. The characters portrayed are often determined by suggestions from viewers in the comments sections of the channel's videos. Shukoff and Ahlquist write each song themselves, researching the subject in order to find obscure details to use as references in the lyrics.<ref name=Forbes>{{cite news|author=Michael Humphrey|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhumphrey/2011/10/26/epic-rap-battles-of-history-talking-brash-wit-with-a-youtube-hit/|title=Epic Rap Battles of History: Talking Brash Wit With A YouTube Hit|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|date=October 26, 2011|accessdate=December 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Inverse>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/38430-epic-rap-battles-season-6-youtube-trump-nazis|title=The Dudes Behind 'Epic Rap Battles of History' Eye an Uncertain Future|last=Francisco|first=Eric|date=November 29, 2017|work=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]|access-date=December 7, 2018}}</ref> As of July 7, 2019, the channel has over 14.5 million subscribers and approximately 3.197 billion total video views.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statsheep.com/ERB|title=ERB YouTube channel statistics - StatSheep|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2019}}</ref> Following an extended hiatus, the channel returned with a bonus battle in December 2018, and the sixth season debuted on April 20, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ERBofHistory/status/1071117277238571008|title=ERB Season 6 Billionaire Bonus Battle is HERE like a Boolean value of 1|date=December 7, 2018|website=@ERBofHistory|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=December 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlthough early episodes of the series featured only Nice Peter and EpicLLOYD, later episodes have regularly featured guest appearances, and other internet celebrities such as [[Dan Bull]], [[Lisa Donovan]], [[Traphik|Timothy DeLaGhetto]], [[George Watsky]], [[DeStorm|DeStorm Power]], [[Jesse Wellens]], [[PewDiePie]], [[Jenna Marbles]], [[Lilly Singh]], [[Ray William Johnson]], [[Rhett and Link]], and [[Smosh]].

The series pits notable historical and pop culture figures, real and fictional, against one another in a [[rap battle]] format. The characters portrayed are often determined by suggestions from viewers in the comments sections of the channel's videos. Shukoff and Ahlquist write each song themselves, researching the subject in order to find obscure details to use as references in the lyrics.<ref name=Forbes>{{cite news|author=Michael Humphrey|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhumphrey/2011/10/26/epic-rap-battles-of-history-talking-brash-wit-with-a-youtube-hit/|title=Epic Rap Battles of History: Talking Brash Wit With A YouTube Hit|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|date=October 26, 2011|accessdate=December 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Inverse>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/38430-epic-rap-battles-season-6-youtube-trump-nazis|title=The Dudes Behind 'Epic Rap Battles of History' Eye an Uncertain Future|last=Francisco|first=Eric|date=November 29, 2017|work=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]|access-date=December 7, 2018}}</ref> As of July 7, 2019, the channel has over 14.5 million subscribers and approximately 3.197 billion total video views.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statsheep.com/ERB|title=ERB YouTube channel statistics - StatSheep|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2019}}</ref> Following an extended hiatus, the channel returned with a bonus battle in December 2018, and the sixth season debuted on April 20, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ERBofHistory/status/1071117277238571008|title=ERB Season 6 Billionaire Bonus Battle is HERE like a Boolean value of 1|date=December 7, 2018|website=@ERBofHistory|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=December 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlthough early episodes of the series featured only Nice Peter and EpicLLOYD, later episodes have regularly featured guest appearances, and other internet celebrities such as [[Dan Bull]], [[Lisa Donovan]], [[Traphik|Timothy DeLaGhetto]], [[George Watsky]], [[DeStorm|DeStorm Power]], [[Jesse Wellens]], [[PewDiePie]], [[Jenna Marbles]], [[Lilly Singh]], [[Ray William Johnson]], [[Rhett and Link]], and [[Smosh]].

[[World Health Organization]] reports that the clinical picture in severe cases is strikingly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza. While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit. Upon admission, most patients need immediate respiratory support with [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html|title=Clinical features of severe cases of pandemic influenza|date=16 October 2009|work=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 13|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=17 January 2010|location=Geneva, Switzerland| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119214956/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html| archivedate= 19 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\nMost complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors.

A 2009 review by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that the 2009 H1N1 vaccine has a safety profile similar to that of seasonal vaccine.\n\nIn 2011, a study from the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network estimated the overall effectiveness of all pandemic H1N1 vaccines at 56%. A CDC study released 28 January 2013, estimated that the Pandemic H1N1 vaccine saved roughly 300 lives and prevented about 1 million illnesses in the US. The study concluded that had the vaccination program started 2 weeks earlier, close to 60% more cases could have been prevented. The study was based on an effectiveness in preventing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths of 62% for all subgroups except people over 65, for whom the effectiveness was estimated at 43%. The effectiveness was based on European and Asian studies and expert opinion. The delay in vaccine administration demonstrated the shortcomings of the world's capacity for vaccine-production, as well as problems with international distribution.

In many cases, hospitals were relatively successful in making sure that those patients most severely affected by the influenza strain were able to be seen, treated, and discharged in an efficient manner. A case-study of the preparation, planning, mitigation, and response efforts during the fall of 2009 is that of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)which took several steps to increase the emergency department(ED) surge capacity response. CHOP used portions of the main lobby area as an ED waiting room; several of the region's hospital-based outpatient facilities were in use during evening and weekend hours for non-emergency cases; the ED's 24-hour short-stay unit was utilized to care for ED patients in a longer-term capacity; non-board certified physicians (in pediatric emergency medicine) and inpatient-unit medical nurses were utilized for ED patient care; hospital units normally utilized for other medical or therapeutic purposes were transformed into ED patient rooms; and rooms normally used for only one patient were expanded to at least a capacity of 2.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scarfone|first= Richard J.|author2=Susan Coffin |author3=Evan S.

[[World Health Organization]] reports that the clinical picture in severe cases is strikingly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza. While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit. Upon admission, most patients need immediate respiratory support with [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html|title=Clinical features of severe cases of pandemic influenza|date=16 October 2009|work=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 13|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=17 January 2010|location=Geneva, Switzerland| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119214956/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html| archivedate= 19 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\nMost complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors.

A 2009 review by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that the 2009 H1N1 vaccine has a safety profile similar to that of seasonal vaccine.\n\nIn 2011, a study from the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network estimated the overall effectiveness of all pandemic H1N1 vaccines at 56%.

The study concluded that had the vaccination program started 2 weeks earlier, close to 60% more cases could have been prevented. The study was based on an effectiveness in preventing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths of 62% for all subgroups except people over 65, for whom the effectiveness was estimated at 43%. The effectiveness was based on European and Asian studies and expert opinion.

Although the pandemic mortality estimate was similar in magnitude to that of seasonal influenza, a marked shift toward mortality among persons <65 years of age occurred, so that many more life-years were lost. Between 123,000 and 203,000 pandemic respiratory deaths were estimated globally for the last 9 months of 2009. The majority (62\u201385%) were attributed to persons under 65 years of age. The burden varied greatly among countries. There was an almost 20-fold higher mortality in some countries in the Americas than in Europe. The model attributed 148,000\u2013249,000 respiratory deaths to influenza in an average pre-pandemic season, with only 19% in persons <65 years of age.<ref name=\"mortality estimate worldwide\">{{cite journal |last=Simonsen |first=Lone |last2=Spreeuwenberg |first2=Peter |last3=Lustig |first3=Roger |last4=Taylor |first4=Robert J. |last5=Fleming |first5=Douglas M. |last6=Kroneman |first6=Madelon |last7=Van Kerkhove |first7=Maria D. |last8=Mounts |first8=Anthony W. |last9=Paget |first9=W.

The [[mobile app|app]] allows users to upload photos and videos, which can be edited with [[Photographic filter|filters]] and organized with [[hashtag|tags]] and [[geotag|location information]]. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, and view trending content. Users can [[Like button|like]] photos and follow other users to add their content to a [[news feed|feed]].\n\nInstagram was originally distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1) [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] with 640 pixels to match the display width of the [[iPhone]] at the time. These restrictions were eased in 2015, with an increase to 1080 pixels. The service also added [[Messaging apps|messaging]] features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, as well as \"Stories\"\u2014similar to its main competitor [[Snapchat]]\u2014which allows users to post photos and videos to a sequential feed, with each post accessible by others for 24 hours each.

A version for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited [[Web application|website interface]] in November 2012, a [[Fire OS]] app on June 15, 2014 and an app for [[Windows 10]] tablets and computers in October 2016. The [[mobile app|app]] allows users to upload photos and videos, which can be edited with [[Photographic filter|filters]] and organized with [[hashtag|tags]] and [[geotag|location information]]. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, and view trending content. Users can [[Like button|like]] photos and follow other users to add their content to a [[news feed|feed]].\n\nInstagram was originally distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1) [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] with 640 pixels to match the display width of the [[iPhone]] at the time. These restrictions were eased in 2015, with an increase to 1080 pixels. The service also added [[Messaging apps|messaging]] features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, as well as \"Stories\"\u2014similar to its main competitor [[Snapchat]]\u2014which allows users to post photos and videos to a sequential feed, with each post accessible by others for 24 hours each. As of January 2019, the Stories feature is used by 500 million users daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/instagram-stories-is-now-being-used-by-500-million-people-daily/547270/|title=Instagram Stories is Now Being Used by 500 Million People Daily|website=Social Media Today|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref>\n\nAfter its launch in 2010, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10&nbsp;million in a year, and 1&nbsp;billion {{as of|2019|May|lc=y}}. In April 2012, Facebook acquired the service for approximately US$1&nbsp;billion in cash and stock. {{As of|2015|10}}, over 40 billion photos had been uploaded. Although praised for its influence, Instagram has been the subject of criticism, most notably for policy and [[User interface|interface]] changes, allegations of censorship, and illegal or improper content uploaded by users.\n\nAs of March 2020, the most followed person is footballer [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] with over 207 million followers, and the most followed woman is singer [[Ariana Grande]] with over 177 million followers.

The CGT was violently opposed to both the authorities and employers. Moreover, it refused to become affiliated with a political party.\n\nIn 1906, the [[Amiens Charter]] (''Charte d'Amiens'') proclaimed the independence of this trade union.\n\nIn 1909, members of the union management and hundreds of CGT members were killed by the French government led by [[Georges Clemenceau]], who called the troops to open fire on the strikers.\n\n==== World War I: Dissension ====\n\nUnder the leadership of [[L\u00e9on Jouhaux]], the Confederation joined the \"[[sacred union]]\" during World War I, which provoked the CGT's first internal division.\nWhile Jouhaux tried to associate the CGT with the authorities, his opponents criticized the pervasive air of nationalism and the preference for struggle with the German proletarians rather than the French employers.\nThey welcomed news of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] with hope.\n\nIn 1919, [[Pierre Monatte]] created the [[Revolutionary Syndicalist Committees]] (''Comit\u00e9s syndicalistes r\u00e9volutionnaires'') current inside the CGT, which opposed the trade-union's collaboration with the government during the war; carried out in the name of the ''[[Union sacr\u00e9e]]'' national bloc.\n\n==== The hope of October 1917 ====\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution, the French labour movement became increasingly divided between [[revolution]]aries who supported the Bolsheviks and strong action at home, and [[Reformism|reformists]] who favoured moderation and re-affiliation to the pre-war [[Socialist International|Second International]].\nOne outcome of this division was the expulsion of the revolutionaries.\nFollowing the 1920 [[Tours Congress]] during which the majority of [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) members voted to accept [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]]'s [[21 Conditions]], leading to the creation of the [[French Communist Party|French Section of the Communist International]] (SFIC), the CGT also split.\n\nRadicals created the ''[[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail unitaire]]'' (CGTU), where communists initially cohabited with anarchists and revolutionary trade unionists.\n\n==== Reconciliation and World War II ====\n\nIn 1934, left-wing parties united to counteract the far-right \"ligues\".\n\nTwo years later, the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] won the [[1936 French legislative election|1936 legislative election]].\n\nAt the same time, the CGT and the CGTU were reunited. [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]] negotiated in June with employers and the Government for the [[1936 Matignon Agreements]]. Nevertheless, the Communists were as a result of the [[German-Soviet pact]] in 1939, then the CGT was dissolved by the [[Vichy government]] but it transformed itself into an organization in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].\n\nIt became increasingly influenced by the [[French Communist Party]].\n\n==== 1945 to 1947 : Division ====\n\nAfter the ejection of the Communists from the government and the 1947 General Strike, a further split took place, this time involving the departure of the reformist Right, followed in 1948, when [[L\u00e9on Jouhaux]] founded [[Force Ouvri\u00e8re|Workers' Force]] (''Force ouvri\u00e8re'' or FO) with U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] support {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\nThe FO criticized the Communist influence as being incompatible with the ''Charte d'Amiens''; and they were generally  [[socialist]],  some [[trotskyist]], some [[anarchist]].\n\nIn order to preserve its unity, the [[Federation for National Education]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de l'Education nationale'' or FEN) left the CGT but did not join the FO.\n\nThe Communist [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]] became leader of the CGT.\n\n=== 1947 to 1990s : The domination of the French Communist Party ===\n==== Alliance and Union of the Left ====\n\nAlthough the CGT was dominant in French trade unionism, it was isolated until 1966.\nAt this moment, it chose to coordinate its actions with the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise D\u00e9mocratique du Travail|French Democratic Confederation of Labour]] (''Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9mocratique du travail'' or CFDT).\n\nDuring [[May 1968 in France]], the CGT was criticized by the far-left because its leader [[Georges S\u00e9guy]] had signed the [[Grenelle agreements]] with Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]], it was assimilated as a betrayal of the revolution.\n\nIn the 1970s, it supported the \"Union of Left\" (alliance between the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS) and [[Parti Radical de Gauche]] (PRG)).\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[1978 French legislative elections|1978 legislative election]], the alliance with the CFDT (who were more linked with the Socialist Party and turned right after the abandon of the \"autogestion\" (self-rule) and class struggle) was broken.\n\n==== The 1980s ====\n\nThe election of [[Henri Krasucki]] in 1982, followed by the resignation of the Communist ministers ([[Charles Fiterman]], [[Marcel Rigout]] and [[Jack Ralite]]) two years later, after the substitution of [[Laurent Fabius]] as Prime minister to [[Pierre Mauroy]], led to an initial radicalisation of the confederation.\n\nHowever, at the end of his term (1982\u20131992), Krasucki began to distance himself from the PCF.<ref name=R89_07>[[Pascal Rich\u00e9]], [http://www.rue89.com/2007/11/21/en-pronant-la-negociation-la-cgt-peut-faire-bouger-le-syndicalisme En pr\u00f4nant la n\u00e9gociation, la CGT \"peut faire bouger le syndicalisme\"], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 21 November 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nHis successor, [[Louis Vianet]], did the same, going as far as resigning from the political bureau of the party.<ref name=R89_07/>\n\nThus, during the 1990s, under the leadership of [[Louis Viannet]] and [[Bernard Thibault]], the CGT cut its organic links with the French Communist Party. It has succeeded in remaining one of the two major French union confederations, while the Communist Party has declined severely.\n\n=== From the 1995 general strike to today ===\n\nIt was the leading trade-union in the [[1995 strikes in France|1995 general strike]] against [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]]'s plan of Welfare State reforms (in particular concerning pensions).\n\nThe CGT also protested against [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) minister [[Fran\u00e7ois Fillon]]'s project of pensions reforms in 2003.\n\nIn February 2005, the National Confederate Committee (CCN), the \"Parliament\" of the trade-union, rejected national secretary [[Bernard Thibault]]'s support of the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] (TCE).\n\nTherefore, the CGT actively supported the \"NO\" during the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum|2005 referendum on the TCE]], criticizing its [[neo-liberalism|neo-liberal]] orientation and weaknesses concerning the few democratic measures about the working of the [[European Union]] (EU) institutions.\n\nIn autumn 2005, the [[Marseille]]se section of the CGT, representing the more radical faction opposed to Bernard Thibault's more centrist views, demonstrated against the privatization of the [[SNCM]] ship company.\nThe CGT then supported the student movement during the [[2006 labour protests in France|2006 protests against]] the ''[[Contrat premi\u00e8re embauche]]'' (CPE, First Employment Contract).\n\nIt supported the movement against the [[El Khomri law]] on labor in spring 2016.\n\nThe CGT left the Communist-oriented [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] at its 1995 congress and became a member of the [[European Trade Union Confederation]] in 1999. It is also a member of the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC) created in 2006.\n\nHowever, several federations and regional branches of the CGT are affiliated to the WFTU.\n\n===Professional elections===\n\nThe CGT won 34% of the vote in the employee's college during the 2008 professional elections, making it the largest trade union in terms of votes in those elections. This positive result marked the first professional election in which the CGT's vote share had not declined: it had declined constantly from 36.35% in 1987 to 32.13% in 2002.\n\n===In Africa===\n\nIn 1937 CGT began organizing workers in [[French West Africa]]. The union's functioning was interrupted by its banning by the Vichy regime, but in 1943-1948 a process of reconstruction took place. The main centers of activity were [[Senegal]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Togo]] and the [[French Soudan]]. CGT had an upper hand in the Muslim regions in comparison to its main rival CFTC, who depended on the presence of Catholic communities for its recruitment. CGT emerged as the major trade union force amongst the 100 000 strong organized labour force in Senegal and [[Mauritania]] after the Second World War.<ref>Fall, Mar.

Paris: \u00c9ditions L'Harmattan, 1989. p. 24, 27</ref>\n\nWithin the CGT branches in the region, there was however a growing wish for independence. A leader of CGT in French West Africa, Bassirou Gu\u00e8ye, promoted this idea. At a meeting of the Territorial Union of Trade Unions in Senegal and Mauritania, held in [[Dakar]] November 11\u2013November 12, 1955, the majority of delegates voted for separation from the French CGT. A conference was held in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] on January 14\u2013January 15, 1956 which formed the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des travailleurs africains]] (CGTA), separating the parts of the West African CGT organizations from the French CGT. At the conference 50 out of 67 delegates had voted for separation.<ref>Fall, Mar. ''L'\u00c9tat et la Question Syndicale au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal''.

Moreover, it refused to become affiliated with a political party.\n\nIn 1906, the [[Amiens Charter]] (''Charte d'Amiens'') proclaimed the independence of this trade union.\n\nIn 1909, members of the union management and hundreds of CGT members were killed by the French government led by [[Georges Clemenceau]], who called the troops to open fire on the strikers.\n\n==== World War I: Dissension ====\n\nUnder the leadership of [[L\u00e9on Jouhaux]], the Confederation joined the \"[[sacred union]]\" during World War I, which provoked the CGT's first internal division.\nWhile Jouhaux tried to associate the CGT with the authorities, his opponents criticized the pervasive air of nationalism and the preference for struggle with the German proletarians rather than the French employers.\nThey welcomed news of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] with hope.\n\nIn 1919, [[Pierre Monatte]] created the [[Revolutionary Syndicalist Committees]] (''Comit\u00e9s syndicalistes r\u00e9volutionnaires'') current inside the CGT, which opposed the trade-union's collaboration with the government during the war; carried out in the name of the ''[[Union sacr\u00e9e]]'' national bloc.\n\n==== The hope of October 1917 ====\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution, the French labour movement became increasingly divided between [[revolution]]aries who supported the Bolsheviks and strong action at home, and [[Reformism|reformists]] who favoured moderation and re-affiliation to the pre-war [[Socialist International|Second International]].\nOne outcome of this division was the expulsion of the revolutionaries.\nFollowing the 1920 [[Tours Congress]] during which the majority of [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) members voted to accept [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]]'s [[21 Conditions]], leading to the creation of the [[French Communist Party|French Section of the Communist International]] (SFIC), the CGT also split.\n\nRadicals created the ''[[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail unitaire]]'' (CGTU), where communists initially cohabited with anarchists and revolutionary trade unionists.\n\n==== Reconciliation and World War II ====\n\nIn 1934, left-wing parties united to counteract the far-right \"ligues\".\n\nTwo years later, the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] won the [[1936 French legislative election|1936 legislative election]].\n\nAt the same time, the CGT and the CGTU were reunited. [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]] negotiated in June with employers and the Government for the [[1936 Matignon Agreements]]. Nevertheless, the Communists were as a result of the [[German-Soviet pact]] in 1939, then the CGT was dissolved by the [[Vichy government]] but it transformed itself into an organization in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].\n\nIt became increasingly influenced by the [[French Communist Party]].\n\n==== 1945 to 1947 : Division ====\n\nAfter the ejection of the Communists from the government and the 1947 General Strike, a further split took place, this time involving the departure of the reformist Right, followed in 1948, when [[L\u00e9on Jouhaux]] founded [[Force Ouvri\u00e8re|Workers' Force]] (''Force ouvri\u00e8re'' or FO) with U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] support {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\nThe FO criticized the Communist influence as being incompatible with the ''Charte d'Amiens''; and they were generally  [[socialist]],  some [[trotskyist]], some [[anarchist]].\n\nIn order to preserve its unity, the [[Federation for National Education]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de l'Education nationale'' or FEN) left the CGT but did not join the FO.\n\nThe Communist [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]] became leader of the CGT.\n\n=== 1947 to 1990s : The domination of the French Communist Party ===\n==== Alliance and Union of the Left ====\n\nAlthough the CGT was dominant in French trade unionism, it was isolated until 1966.\nAt this moment, it chose to coordinate its actions with the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise D\u00e9mocratique du Travail|French Democratic Confederation of Labour]] (''Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9mocratique du travail'' or CFDT).\n\nDuring [[May 1968 in France]], the CGT was criticized by the far-left because its leader [[Georges S\u00e9guy]] had signed the [[Grenelle agreements]] with Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]], it was assimilated as a betrayal of the revolution.\n\nIn the 1970s, it supported the \"Union of Left\" (alliance between the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS) and [[Parti Radical de Gauche]] (PRG)).\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[1978 French legislative elections|1978 legislative election]], the alliance with the CFDT (who were more linked with the Socialist Party and turned right after the abandon of the \"autogestion\" (self-rule) and class struggle) was broken.\n\n==== The 1980s ====\n\nThe election of [[Henri Krasucki]] in 1982, followed by the resignation of the Communist ministers ([[Charles Fiterman]], [[Marcel Rigout]] and [[Jack Ralite]]) two years later, after the substitution of [[Laurent Fabius]] as Prime minister to [[Pierre Mauroy]], led to an initial radicalisation of the confederation.\n\nHowever, at the end of his term (1982\u20131992), Krasucki began to distance himself from the PCF.<ref name=R89_07>[[Pascal Rich\u00e9]], [http://www.rue89.com/2007/11/21/en-pronant-la-negociation-la-cgt-peut-faire-bouger-le-syndicalisme En pr\u00f4nant la n\u00e9gociation, la CGT \"peut faire bouger le syndicalisme\"], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 21 November 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nHis successor, [[Louis Vianet]], did the same, going as far as resigning from the political bureau of the party.<ref name=R89_07/>\n\nThus, during the 1990s, under the leadership of [[Louis Viannet]] and [[Bernard Thibault]], the CGT cut its organic links with the French Communist Party. It has succeeded in remaining one of the two major French union confederations, while the Communist Party has declined severely.\n\n=== From the 1995 general strike to today ===\n\nIt was the leading trade-union in the [[1995 strikes in France|1995 general strike]] against [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]]'s plan of Welfare State reforms (in particular concerning pensions).\n\nThe CGT also protested against [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) minister [[Fran\u00e7ois Fillon]]'s project of pensions reforms in 2003.\n\nIn February 2005, the National Confederate Committee (CCN), the \"Parliament\" of the trade-union, rejected national secretary [[Bernard Thibault]]'s support of the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] (TCE).\n\nTherefore, the CGT actively supported the \"NO\" during the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum|2005 referendum on the TCE]], criticizing its [[neo-liberalism|neo-liberal]] orientation and weaknesses concerning the few democratic measures about the working of the [[European Union]] (EU) institutions.\n\nIn autumn 2005, the [[Marseille]]se section of the CGT, representing the more radical faction opposed to Bernard Thibault's more centrist views, demonstrated against the privatization of the [[SNCM]] ship company.\nThe CGT then supported the student movement during the [[2006 labour protests in France|2006 protests against]] the ''[[Contrat premi\u00e8re embauche]]'' (CPE, First Employment Contract).\n\nIt supported the movement against the [[El Khomri law]] on labor in spring 2016.\n\nThe CGT left the Communist-oriented [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] at its 1995 congress and became a member of the [[European Trade Union Confederation]] in 1999. It is also a member of the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC) created in 2006.\n\nHowever, several federations and regional branches of the CGT are affiliated to the WFTU.\n\n===Professional elections===\n\nThe CGT won 34% of the vote in the employee's college during the 2008 professional elections, making it the largest trade union in terms of votes in those elections. This positive result marked the first professional election in which the CGT's vote share had not declined: it had declined constantly from 36.35% in 1987 to 32.13% in 2002.\n\n===In Africa===\n\nIn 1937 CGT began organizing workers in [[French West Africa]]. The union's functioning was interrupted by its banning by the Vichy regime, but in 1943-1948 a process of reconstruction took place. The main centers of activity were [[Senegal]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Togo]] and the [[French Soudan]]. CGT had an upper hand in the Muslim regions in comparison to its main rival CFTC, who depended on the presence of Catholic communities for its recruitment. CGT emerged as the major trade union force amongst the 100 000 strong organized labour force in Senegal and [[Mauritania]] after the Second World War.<ref>Fall, Mar.

Paris: \u00c9ditions L'Harmattan, 1989. p. 24, 27</ref>\n\nWithin the CGT branches in the region, there was however a growing wish for independence. A leader of CGT in French West Africa, Bassirou Gu\u00e8ye, promoted this idea. At a meeting of the Territorial Union of Trade Unions in Senegal and Mauritania, held in [[Dakar]] November 11\u2013November 12, 1955, the majority of delegates voted for separation from the French CGT. A conference was held in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] on January 14\u2013January 15, 1956 which formed the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des travailleurs africains]] (CGTA), separating the parts of the West African CGT organizations from the French CGT. At the conference 50 out of 67 delegates had voted for separation.<ref>Fall, Mar. ''L'\u00c9tat et la Question Syndicale au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal''. Paris: \u00c9ditions L'Harmattan, 1989. p. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nIn Togo, CGT had 45,100 members in 1948 (65% of organized labour). By 1952 the number had decreased to 34,000 (46% of organized labour).<ref>Fall, Mar. ''L'\u00c9tat et la Question Syndicale au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal''.

However, it was an incident at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] which is most likely to have led to the establishment of the university: two Oxford scholars were hanged by the town authorities for the death of a woman, without consulting the ecclesiastical authorities, who would normally take precedence (and pardon the scholars) in such a case, but were at that time in conflict with [[John, King of England|King John]]. Fearing more violence from the townsfolk, scholars from the University of Oxford started to move away to cities such as [[Paris]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], and [[Cambridge]]. Subsequently, enough scholars remained in Cambridge to form the nucleus of a new university when it had become safe enough for academia to resume at Oxford.<ref name=\"Early records\"/><ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/oxford/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_9158000/9158705.stm |title = 'To lick a Lord and thrash a cad': Oxford 'Town & Gown' |last = Davies |first = Mark |publisher = BBC |date = 4 November 2010 |website = BBC News |accessdate= 3 January 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xvScOaG7mHYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=1209|title=A Concise History of the University of Cambridge|last=Leedham-Green|first=Elisabeth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|page=3|isbn=978-0-521-43978-7|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> In order to claim precedence, it is common for Cambridge to trace its founding to the 1231 charter from [[Henry III of England|King Henry&nbsp;III]] granting it the right to discipline its own members (''ius non-trahi extra'') and an exemption from some taxes; Oxford was not granted similar rights until 1248.<ref>{{cite web |work=British History Timeline |title=Middle Ages |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/timeline/middleages_timeline_noflash.shtml |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nA [[Papal bull|bull]] in 1233 from [[Pope Gregory IX]] gave graduates from Cambridge the right to teach \"everywhere in [[Christendom]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|first=Hilde|last=de Ridder-Symoens|title=A History of the University in Europe: Universities in the Middle Ages|volume=1|year=2003|editor=Cambridge University Press|page=89|isbn=978-0-521-54113-8}}</ref> After Cambridge was described as a ''[[studium generale]]'' in a letter from [[Pope Nicholas IV]] in 1290,<ref name=Hackett>{{cite book|last=Hackett|first=M.B.|title=The original statutes of Cambridge University: The text and its history|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1970|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7og8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA178|accessdate=2 September 2012|isbn=9780521070768}}</ref> and confirmed as such in a [[papal bull|bull]] by [[Pope John XXII]] in 1318,<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=David Willey (journalist)|first=David|last=Willey|title=Vatican reveals Cambridge papers|journal=Cam|volume=66|date=2012|page=5}}</ref> it became common for researchers from other European [[medieval universities]] to visit Cambridge to study or to give lecture courses.<ref name=Hackett />\n\n===Foundation of the colleges===\n[[File:The Chapel Emmanuel College2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Emmanuel College Chapel|[[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]] Chapel]]\nThe [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|colleges]] at the University of Cambridge were originally an incidental feature of the system. No college is as old as the university itself. The colleges were endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels. The hostels were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, but they have left some traces, such as the name of Garret Hostel Lane.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Charles Henry|last=Cooper|title=Memorials of Cambridge|volume=1|publisher=W.

Many colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, but colleges continued to be established until modern times, although there was a gap of 204 years between the founding of [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge|Sidney Sussex]] in 1596 and that of [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing]] in 1800. The most recently established college is [[Robinson College, Cambridge|Robinson]], built in the late 1970s. However, [[Homerton College, Cambridge|Homerton College]] only achieved full university college status in March 2010, making it the newest full college (it was previously an \"Approved Society\" affiliated with the university).\n\nIn [[medieval]] times, many colleges were founded so that their members would [[Prayer|pray]] for the [[soul]]s of the founders, and were often associated with chapels or [[abbey]]s. The colleges' focus changed in 1536 with the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] ordered the university to disband its Faculty of [[Canon Law]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Helmholtz|first=R.H.|year=1990|title=Roman Canon Law in Reformation England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|series=Cambridge Studies in English Legal History|pages=35,153|isbn=978-0521381918}}</ref> and to stop teaching \"[[scholastic philosophy]]\". In response, colleges changed their curricula away from canon law, and towards the [[classics]], the Bible, and mathematics.\n\nNearly a century later, the university was at the centre of a Protestant schism. Many nobles, intellectuals and even commoners saw the ways of the [[Church of England]] as too similar to the Catholic Church, and felt that it was used by the Crown to usurp the rightful powers of the counties. [[East Anglia]] was the centre of what became the [[Puritan]] movement. In Cambridge, the movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine's Hall, Sidney Sussex and [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]].<ref>Thompson, Roger, Mobility & Migration, East Anglian Founders of New England, 1629\u20131640, Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1994, 19.</ref> They produced many \"non-conformist\" graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who left for [[New England]] and especially the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] during the [[Great Migration (Puritan)|Great Migration]] decade of the 1630s.

The exam is known as a [[Tripos]].<ref>{{Cite journal|first=A.

H. Hardy]], disliked the system, feeling that people were too interested in accumulating marks in exams and not interested in the subject itself.\n\nPure mathematics at Cambridge in the 19th century achieved great things, but also missed out on substantial developments in French and German mathematics. Pure mathematical research at Cambridge finally reached the highest international standard in the early 20th century, thanks above all to G. H. Hardy, his collaborator [[J. E. Littlewood]] and [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]. In geometry, [[W. V. D. Hodge]] brought Cambridge onto the international mainstream in the 1930s.\n\nAlthough diversified in its research and teaching interests, Cambridge today maintains its strength in mathematics.

Teaching, and the fees it earned, came almost to a stop and severe financial difficulties followed. As a consequence the university first received systematic state support in 1919, and a [[Royal Commission]] appointed in 1920 recommended that the university (but not the colleges) should receive an annual grant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/history/nineteenth-and-twentieth-centuries|title=The Revived University of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|editor=University of Cambridge|accessdate=7 August 2014|date=28 January 2013}}</ref> Following the [[Second World War]], the university saw a rapid expansion of student numbers and available places; this was partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/history/post1945.html|title=A Brief History: The University after 1945|publisher=University of Cambridge|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804082343/http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/history/post1945.html|archivedate=4 August 2008|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Parliamentary representation====\n{{Main|University of Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)}}\n\nThe university was one of only two universities to hold parliamentary seats in the [[Parliament of England]] and was later one of eight represented in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The constituency was created by a [[Royal Charter]] of 1603 and returned two members of parliament until 1950, when it was abolished by the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]].\n\nThe constituency was not a geographical area. Its electorate consisted of the graduates of the university. Before 1918 the franchise was restricted to male graduates with a doctorate or [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] degree.\n\n===Women's education===\n[[File:Cambridge Newnham.JPG|thumb|[[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]] is one of three existing women's colleges]]\nFor many years only male students were enrolled into the university. The first colleges for women were [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]] (founded by [[Emily Davies]]) in 1869 and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]] in 1872 (founded by [[Anne Clough]] and [[Henry Sidgwick]]), followed by [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge|Hughes Hall]] in 1885 (founded by [[Elizabeth Phillips Hughes]] as the Cambridge Teaching College for Women), [[Murray Edwards College]] (founded by [[Rosemary Murray]] as [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|New Hall]]) in 1954, and [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish College]] in 1965.

As they were not \"admitted to the Degree of Bachelor of Arts\" they were excluded from the governing of the university. Since students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to colleges established only for women. Darwin College, the first wholly graduate college of the university, matriculated both men and women students from its inception in 1964 \u2013 and elected a mixed fellowship. Of the undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare and King's Colleges, the former men's colleges began to admit women between 1972 and 1988. One of the female-only colleges, Girton, also began to admit male students from 1979, but the other female-only colleges did not do likewise. As a result of [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]], ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining United Kingdom university with female-only colleges (Newnham, Murray Edwards and Lucy Cavendish).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1520628/St-Hilda%27s-to-end-113-year-ban-on-male-students.html|title=St Hilda's to end 113-year ban on male students|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=8 September 2008 | first=Nicole | last=Martin | date=8 June 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hero.ac.uk/uk/studying/archives/2007/single_sex_colleges__a_dying_breed__Jun.cfm |title=Single-sex colleges: a dying breed? |publisher=HERO |date=June 2007 |accessdate=20 April 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080612072113/http://www.hero.ac.uk/uk/studying/archives/2007/single_sex_colleges__a_dying_breed__Jun.cfm |archivedate = 12 June 2008}}</ref> In the academic year 2004\u20135, the university's student sex ratio, including post-graduates, was male 52%: female 48%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2004-05/special/19/|title=Special No 19|work=Cambridge University Reporter|accessdate=8 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Myths, legends and traditions===\n[[File:cambridge uni math bridge.JPG|thumb|The [[Mathematical Bridge]] over the River Cam (at [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]])]]\n{{main|University of Cambridge legends}} {{see also|Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge}}\nAs an institution with such a long history, the university has developed a large number of myths and legends. The vast majority of these are untrue, but have been propagated nonetheless by generations of students and tour guides.\n\nA discontinued tradition is that of the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]], the 'prize' awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's. Since 1908, examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit. This made it harder to ascertain who was \"entitled\" to the spoon (unless there was only one person in the third class), and so the practice was abandoned.\n\nEach Christmas Eve, BBC radio and television broadcasts [[Nine Lessons and Carols|The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols]] sung by the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge]]. The radio broadcast has been a national Christmas tradition since it was first transmitted in 1928 (though the festival has existed since 1918).

There are many stories of ferocious rivalry between the two categories. During the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, strong clashes brought about attacks and [[looting]] of university properties while locals contested the privileges granted by the government to the academic staff, the university's ledgers being burned in [[Market Hill, Cambridge|Market Square]] to the rallying cry [[\"Away with the learning of clerks, away with it!\"]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Crisis of Truth: Literature and Law in Ricardian England.|last=Firth Green|first=Richard|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2002|isbn=9780812218091|location=Philadelphia|pages=}}</ref> Following these events, the Chancellor was given special powers allowing him to prosecute the criminals and re-establish order in the city.

However, this was followed by new confrontations when the [[plague (disease)|plague]] hit Cambridge in 1630 and colleges refused to help those affected by the disease by locking their sites.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Shepard|first1=Alexandra|last2=Phil |first2=Withington|title=Communities in Early Modern England: Networks, Place, Rhetoric|editor=Manchester University Press|year=2000|pages=216\u2013234|isbn=978-0-7190-5477-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLkULGOljPsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nNowadays, these conflicts have somewhat subsided and the university has become an opportunity for employment among the population, providing an increased level of wealth in the area.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bringham|first=Allan|url=http://www.colc.co.uk/cambridge/tours/article2.htm|title=Is Town v Gown a thing of the past?|date=7 October 2008|newspaper=[[Cambridge Evening News]]|via=Cambridge Online|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> The enormous growth in the number of [[high-tech]], [[biotech]], providers of services and related firms situated near Cambridge has been termed the ''Cambridge Phenomenon'': the addition of 1,500 new, registered companies and as many as 40,000 jobs between 1960 and 2010 has been directly related to the presence and importance of the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgephenomenon.com/what-phenomenon/|title=What is the Cambridge Phenomenon?|publisher=Cambridge Phenomenon|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation and administration==\n{{see also|List of Institutions of the University of Cambridge}}\n[[File:Cam colls from johns.jpg|thumb|right|View over [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius]], [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]] and [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] towards [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] Chapel, seen from [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] chapel whereas on the left, just in front of King's College chapel, is the University [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]]]]\n\nCambridge is a [[collegiate university]], meaning that it is made up of self-governing and independent colleges, each with its own property and income. Most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines, and within each faculty, school or department within the university, academics from many different colleges will be found.\n\nThe faculties are responsible for ensuring that lectures are given, arranging seminars, performing research and determining the syllabi for teaching, overseen by the General Board. Together with the central administration headed by the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Vice-Chancellor]], they make up the entire Cambridge University. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the university (the [[Cambridge University Library]]), by the Faculties (Faculty libraries such as the Squire Law Library), and by the individual colleges (all of which maintain a multi-discipline library, generally aimed mainly at their undergraduates).\n\n===Colleges===\n{{main|Colleges of the University of Cambridge}}\n[[File:Presidents Lodge, Queens' College, Cambridge.JPG|thumb|right|The President's Lodge at [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]]]]\n[[File:Bridge of Sighs, St John's College, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bridge of Sighs (Cambridge)|Bridge of Sighs]] at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]]]\n\nThe colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, founded as integral parts of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. Their importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees, but undergraduates receive their supervisions\u2014small-group teaching sessions, often with just one student\u2014within the colleges (though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in the areas concerned). Each college appoints its own teaching staff and [[fellow]]s, who are also members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university regulations.\n\nCambridge has 31 colleges, of which three, [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|Murray Edwards]], [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] and [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish]], admit women only. The other colleges are [[Mixed-sex education|mixed]], though most were originally all-male.

[[Cambridge University Press]], a department of the university, is the world's oldest publishing house and the second-largest university press in the world. [[University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate|Cambridge Assessment]], also a department of the university, is one of the world's leading examining bodies and provides assessment to over eight million learners globally every year. The university also operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], as well as a [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden|botanic garden]]. [[Libraries of the University of Cambridge|Cambridge's libraries]], of which there are over 100, hold a total of around 16 million books, around nine&nbsp;million of which are in [[Cambridge University Library]], a [[legal deposit library]]. The university is home to, but independent of, the [[Cambridge Union]] - the world's oldest debating society. The university is closely linked to the development of the high-tech [[business cluster]] known as '[[Silicon Fen]]'. It is the central member of [[Cambridge University Health Partners]], an [[academic health science centre]] based around the [[Cambridge Biomedical Campus]].\n\nIn the fiscal year ending 31 July 2018, the central university, excluding colleges, had a total income of \u00a31.965&nbsp;billion, of which \u00a3515.5 million was from research grants and contracts.<ref name=\"cam.ac.uk\"/> At the end of the same financial year, the central university and colleges together possessed a combined endowment of over \u00a36.4 billion and overall consolidated assets of \u00a312.2 billion.<ref name=\"cam.ac.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2018-19/weekly/6530/section4.shtml#heading2-13|title=Reports and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2018 - Cambridge University Reporter 6530|website=www.admin.cam.ac.uk}}</ref> The latter figure was \u00a3400 million higher than the previous financial year.

However, it was an incident at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] which is most likely to have led to the establishment of the university: two Oxford scholars were hanged by the town authorities for the death of a woman, without consulting the ecclesiastical authorities, who would normally take precedence (and pardon the scholars) in such a case, but were at that time in conflict with [[John, King of England|King John]]. Fearing more violence from the townsfolk, scholars from the University of Oxford started to move away to cities such as [[Paris]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], and [[Cambridge]]. Subsequently, enough scholars remained in Cambridge to form the nucleus of a new university when it had become safe enough for academia to resume at Oxford.<ref name=\"Early records\"/><ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/oxford/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_9158000/9158705.stm |title = 'To lick a Lord and thrash a cad': Oxford 'Town & Gown' |last = Davies |first = Mark |publisher = BBC |date = 4 November 2010 |website = BBC News |accessdate= 3 January 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xvScOaG7mHYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=1209|title=A Concise History of the University of Cambridge|last=Leedham-Green|first=Elisabeth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|page=3|isbn=978-0-521-43978-7|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> In order to claim precedence, it is common for Cambridge to trace its founding to the 1231 charter from [[Henry III of England|King Henry&nbsp;III]] granting it the right to discipline its own members (''ius non-trahi extra'') and an exemption from some taxes; Oxford was not granted similar rights until 1248.<ref>{{cite web |work=British History Timeline |title=Middle Ages |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/timeline/middleages_timeline_noflash.shtml |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nA [[Papal bull|bull]] in 1233 from [[Pope Gregory IX]] gave graduates from Cambridge the right to teach \"everywhere in [[Christendom]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|first=Hilde|last=de Ridder-Symoens|title=A History of the University in Europe: Universities in the Middle Ages|volume=1|year=2003|editor=Cambridge University Press|page=89|isbn=978-0-521-54113-8}}</ref> After Cambridge was described as a ''[[studium generale]]'' in a letter from [[Pope Nicholas IV]] in 1290,<ref name=Hackett>{{cite book|last=Hackett|first=M.B.|title=The original statutes of Cambridge University: The text and its history|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1970|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7og8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA178|accessdate=2 September 2012|isbn=9780521070768}}</ref> and confirmed as such in a [[papal bull|bull]] by [[Pope John XXII]] in 1318,<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=David Willey (journalist)|first=David|last=Willey|title=Vatican reveals Cambridge papers|journal=Cam|volume=66|date=2012|page=5}}</ref> it became common for researchers from other European [[medieval universities]] to visit Cambridge to study or to give lecture courses.<ref name=Hackett />\n\n===Foundation of the colleges===\n[[File:The Chapel Emmanuel College2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Emmanuel College Chapel|[[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]] Chapel]]\nThe [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|colleges]] at the University of Cambridge were originally an incidental feature of the system. No college is as old as the university itself. The colleges were endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels. The hostels were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, but they have left some traces, such as the name of Garret Hostel Lane.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Charles Henry|last=Cooper|title=Memorials of Cambridge|volume=1|publisher=W.

Many colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, but colleges continued to be established until modern times, although there was a gap of 204 years between the founding of [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge|Sidney Sussex]] in 1596 and that of [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing]] in 1800. The most recently established college is [[Robinson College, Cambridge|Robinson]], built in the late 1970s. However, [[Homerton College, Cambridge|Homerton College]] only achieved full university college status in March 2010, making it the newest full college (it was previously an \"Approved Society\" affiliated with the university).\n\nIn [[medieval]] times, many colleges were founded so that their members would [[Prayer|pray]] for the [[soul]]s of the founders, and were often associated with chapels or [[abbey]]s. The colleges' focus changed in 1536 with the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] ordered the university to disband its Faculty of [[Canon Law]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Helmholtz|first=R.H.|year=1990|title=Roman Canon Law in Reformation England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|series=Cambridge Studies in English Legal History|pages=35,153|isbn=978-0521381918}}</ref> and to stop teaching \"[[scholastic philosophy]]\". In response, colleges changed their curricula away from canon law, and towards the [[classics]], the Bible, and mathematics.\n\nNearly a century later, the university was at the centre of a Protestant schism. Many nobles, intellectuals and even commoners saw the ways of the [[Church of England]] as too similar to the Catholic Church, and felt that it was used by the Crown to usurp the rightful powers of the counties. [[East Anglia]] was the centre of what became the [[Puritan]] movement. In Cambridge, the movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine's Hall, Sidney Sussex and [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]].<ref>Thompson, Roger, Mobility & Migration, East Anglian Founders of New England, 1629\u20131640, Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1994, 19.</ref> They produced many \"non-conformist\" graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who left for [[New England]] and especially the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] during the [[Great Migration (Puritan)|Great Migration]] decade of the 1630s.

From the time of [[Isaac Newton]] in the later 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on [[applied mathematics]], particularly [[mathematical physics]]. The exam is known as a [[Tripos]].<ref>{{Cite journal|first=A.

H. Hardy]], disliked the system, feeling that people were too interested in accumulating marks in exams and not interested in the subject itself.\n\nPure mathematics at Cambridge in the 19th century achieved great things, but also missed out on substantial developments in French and German mathematics. Pure mathematical research at Cambridge finally reached the highest international standard in the early 20th century, thanks above all to G. H. Hardy, his collaborator [[J. E. Littlewood]] and [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]. In geometry, [[W. V. D. Hodge]] brought Cambridge onto the international mainstream in the 1930s.\n\nAlthough diversified in its research and teaching interests, Cambridge today maintains its strength in mathematics. Cambridge alumni have won six [[Fields Medal]]s and one [[Abel Prize]] for mathematics, while individuals representing Cambridge have won four Fields Medals.<ref>The six alumni are [[Michael Atiyah]] (Abel Prize and Fields Medal), [[Enrico Bombieri]], [[Simon Donaldson]], [[Richard Borcherds]], [[Timothy Gowers]], [[Alan Baker (mathematician)|Alan Baker]] and the four official representatives were [[John G.

Teaching, and the fees it earned, came almost to a stop and severe financial difficulties followed. As a consequence the university first received systematic state support in 1919, and a [[Royal Commission]] appointed in 1920 recommended that the university (but not the colleges) should receive an annual grant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/history/nineteenth-and-twentieth-centuries|title=The Revived University of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|editor=University of Cambridge|accessdate=7 August 2014|date=28 January 2013}}</ref> Following the [[Second World War]], the university saw a rapid expansion of student numbers and available places; this was partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/history/post1945.html|title=A Brief History: The University after 1945|publisher=University of Cambridge|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804082343/http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/history/post1945.html|archivedate=4 August 2008|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Parliamentary representation====\n{{Main|University of Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)}}\n\nThe university was one of only two universities to hold parliamentary seats in the [[Parliament of England]] and was later one of eight represented in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The constituency was created by a [[Royal Charter]] of 1603 and returned two members of parliament until 1950, when it was abolished by the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]].\n\nThe constituency was not a geographical area. Its electorate consisted of the graduates of the university. Before 1918 the franchise was restricted to male graduates with a doctorate or [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] degree.\n\n===Women's education===\n[[File:Cambridge Newnham.JPG|thumb|[[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]] is one of three existing women's colleges]]\nFor many years only male students were enrolled into the university. The first colleges for women were [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]] (founded by [[Emily Davies]]) in 1869 and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]] in 1872 (founded by [[Anne Clough]] and [[Henry Sidgwick]]), followed by [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge|Hughes Hall]] in 1885 (founded by [[Elizabeth Phillips Hughes]] as the Cambridge Teaching College for Women), [[Murray Edwards College]] (founded by [[Rosemary Murray]] as [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|New Hall]]) in 1954, and [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish College]] in 1965.

As they were not \"admitted to the Degree of Bachelor of Arts\" they were excluded from the governing of the university. Since students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to colleges established only for women. Darwin College, the first wholly graduate college of the university, matriculated both men and women students from its inception in 1964 \u2013 and elected a mixed fellowship. Of the undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare and King's Colleges, the former men's colleges began to admit women between 1972 and 1988. One of the female-only colleges, Girton, also began to admit male students from 1979, but the other female-only colleges did not do likewise. As a result of [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]], ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining United Kingdom university with female-only colleges (Newnham, Murray Edwards and Lucy Cavendish).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1520628/St-Hilda%27s-to-end-113-year-ban-on-male-students.html|title=St Hilda's to end 113-year ban on male students|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=8 September 2008 | first=Nicole | last=Martin | date=8 June 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hero.ac.uk/uk/studying/archives/2007/single_sex_colleges__a_dying_breed__Jun.cfm |title=Single-sex colleges: a dying breed? |publisher=HERO |date=June 2007 |accessdate=20 April 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080612072113/http://www.hero.ac.uk/uk/studying/archives/2007/single_sex_colleges__a_dying_breed__Jun.cfm |archivedate = 12 June 2008}}</ref> In the academic year 2004\u20135, the university's student sex ratio, including post-graduates, was male 52%: female 48%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2004-05/special/19/|title=Special No 19|work=Cambridge University Reporter|accessdate=8 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Myths, legends and traditions===\n[[File:cambridge uni math bridge.JPG|thumb|The [[Mathematical Bridge]] over the River Cam (at [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]])]]\n{{main|University of Cambridge legends}} {{see also|Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge}}\nAs an institution with such a long history, the university has developed a large number of myths and legends. The vast majority of these are untrue, but have been propagated nonetheless by generations of students and tour guides.\n\nA discontinued tradition is that of the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]], the 'prize' awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's. Since 1908, examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit. This made it harder to ascertain who was \"entitled\" to the spoon (unless there was only one person in the third class), and so the practice was abandoned.\n\nEach Christmas Eve, BBC radio and television broadcasts [[Nine Lessons and Carols|The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols]] sung by the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge]].

There are many stories of ferocious rivalry between the two categories. During the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, strong clashes brought about attacks and [[looting]] of university properties while locals contested the privileges granted by the government to the academic staff, the university's ledgers being burned in [[Market Hill, Cambridge|Market Square]] to the rallying cry [[\"Away with the learning of clerks, away with it!\"]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Crisis of Truth: Literature and Law in Ricardian England.|last=Firth Green|first=Richard|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2002|isbn=9780812218091|location=Philadelphia|pages=}}</ref> Following these events, the Chancellor was given special powers allowing him to prosecute the criminals and re-establish order in the city.

However, this was followed by new confrontations when the [[plague (disease)|plague]] hit Cambridge in 1630 and colleges refused to help those affected by the disease by locking their sites.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Shepard|first1=Alexandra|last2=Phil |first2=Withington|title=Communities in Early Modern England: Networks, Place, Rhetoric|editor=Manchester University Press|year=2000|pages=216\u2013234|isbn=978-0-7190-5477-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLkULGOljPsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nNowadays, these conflicts have somewhat subsided and the university has become an opportunity for employment among the population, providing an increased level of wealth in the area.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bringham|first=Allan|url=http://www.colc.co.uk/cambridge/tours/article2.htm|title=Is Town v Gown a thing of the past?|date=7 October 2008|newspaper=[[Cambridge Evening News]]|via=Cambridge Online|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> The enormous growth in the number of [[high-tech]], [[biotech]], providers of services and related firms situated near Cambridge has been termed the ''Cambridge Phenomenon'': the addition of 1,500 new, registered companies and as many as 40,000 jobs between 1960 and 2010 has been directly related to the presence and importance of the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgephenomenon.com/what-phenomenon/|title=What is the Cambridge Phenomenon?|publisher=Cambridge Phenomenon|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation and administration==\n{{see also|List of Institutions of the University of Cambridge}}\n[[File:Cam colls from johns.jpg|thumb|right|View over [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius]], [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]] and [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] towards [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] Chapel, seen from [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] chapel whereas on the left, just in front of King's College chapel, is the University [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]]]]\n\nCambridge is a [[collegiate university]], meaning that it is made up of self-governing and independent colleges, each with its own property and income. Most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines, and within each faculty, school or department within the university, academics from many different colleges will be found.\n\nThe faculties are responsible for ensuring that lectures are given, arranging seminars, performing research and determining the syllabi for teaching, overseen by the General Board. Together with the central administration headed by the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Vice-Chancellor]], they make up the entire Cambridge University. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the university (the [[Cambridge University Library]]), by the Faculties (Faculty libraries such as the Squire Law Library), and by the individual colleges (all of which maintain a multi-discipline library, generally aimed mainly at their undergraduates).\n\n===Colleges===\n{{main|Colleges of the University of Cambridge}}\n[[File:Presidents Lodge, Queens' College, Cambridge.JPG|thumb|right|The President's Lodge at [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]]]]\n[[File:Bridge of Sighs, St John's College, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bridge of Sighs (Cambridge)|Bridge of Sighs]] at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]]]\n\nThe colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, founded as integral parts of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. Their importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees, but undergraduates receive their supervisions\u2014small-group teaching sessions, often with just one student\u2014within the colleges (though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in the areas concerned). Each college appoints its own teaching staff and [[fellow]]s, who are also members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university regulations.\n\nCambridge has 31 colleges, of which three, [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|Murray Edwards]], [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] and [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish]], admit women only. The other colleges are [[Mixed-sex education|mixed]], though most were originally all-male.
