He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbuck's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. From 2001 to 2006, he owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], a basketball franchise that he sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who moved the team to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open Il Giornale, a specialty coffeeshop that quickly merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Shultz pushed the new company to sell more than [[Coffee bean|coffee beans]] and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served [[espresso]], [[coffee]], teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became [[List of coffeehouse chains|the largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Shultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbuck's international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. He led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. Shultz orchestrated multiple [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] of American and Chinese beverage companies and introduced a national [[loyalty program]]. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling [[Chinese tea culture|the country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub is widely seen as introducing [[Third wave of coffee#History|the second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in Seattle. His second tenure sustained both [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant criticism]] and growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nSchultz was named the [[The World's Billionaires|145th-richest person in the United States]] by ''Forbes'' in 2019 with a [[net worth]] of $4.1 billion (November 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-schultz/#6de1621452c6|title=Howard Schultz|website=Forbes|access-date=April 2, 2019|language=en}}</ref> He is the author of [[Howard Schultz#Books|three books]], ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|centrist]], moderate, and independent political views, Schultz explored a run in the [[2020 United States presidential election]] as an independent candidate but declined to formally join the contest for fear of re-electing [[Donald Trump]]. Schultz supports nonpartisan immigration policy, [[free trade]], [[Balanced budget|fiscal discipline]], comprehensive tax reform, gun control, same-sex marriage, and more generally, [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum. To further his philanthropic efforts, he established the Schultz Family Foundation which focuses on [[Veteran#Health effects of military service and treatment for veterans|helping military veterans]] and fighting [[youth unemployment]].<!--Leave space for {{TOC}}.-->   \n\n== Early life and education ==\nSchultz was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family on July 19, 1953, in the [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn borough]] of New York,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/02/business/new-economy-starbucks-was-put-defensive-attack-internet-rumor-mill-that-would.html New York Times: \"New Economy; How Starbucks was put on the defensive by an attack on the Internet rumor mill that would not go away\" By Sherri Day] June 2, 2003</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/howard-schultz-i-raise-my-frappuccino-to-the-brits-1655293.html|title=Howard Schultz: I raise my frappuccino to the Brits|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref> the son of Elaine (Lederman) and her husband, ex-[[United States Army]] soldier and then truck driver Fred Schultz.<ref name=\"Mirror22464724\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/08/05/starbucks-howard-schultz-on-how-he-became-coffee-king-115875-22464724/|title= Starbucks' Howard Schultz on how he became coffee king|author=Melissa Thompson|publisher=Sunday Mirror|date=August 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Koehn\">Howard is constantly reminding his team, \"We are not in the coffee business serving people; we are in the people business serving coffee.\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20140104040308/http://skellogg.sdsmt.edu/IE354/Supplement/howars_s.pdf Kellogg School of Management: \"Howard Schultz and Starbucks Coffee Company\" by] [[Nancy Koehn|Nancy F.

He learned that they not only served excellent [[espresso]], they also served as meeting places or public squares; the 200,000 caf\u00e9s in the country were an important element of Italian culture and society. On his return, he tried to persuade the owners (including cofounder [[Jerry Baldwin]]) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide, saying they did not want to get into the restaurant business. Frustrated, Schultz decided to leave Starbucks in 1985. He needed $400,000 to open the first store and start the business. He did not have the money and his wife was pregnant with their first baby. Jerry Baldwin and Starbucks cofounder [[Gordon Bowker]] offered to help. Schultz also received $100,000 from a doctor who was impressed by Schultz's energy to \"take a gamble\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullins|first=John|title=The New Business Road Test|url=https://archive.org/details/newbusinessroadt0000mull|url-access=registration|year=2007}}</ref> By 1986, he had raised all the money he needed to open the first store, \"Il Giornale\", named after [[Il Giornale|the Milanese newspaper]] of the same name. The store offered ice cream in addition to coffee, had little seating, and played opera music in the background to portray an Italian experience. Two years later, the original Starbucks management decided to focus on [[Peet's Coffee & Tea]] and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale for US$3.8&nbsp;million.\n\nSchultz renamed Il Giornale with the Starbucks name, and aggressively expanded its reach across the United States. Schultz's insight in real estate and his hard-line focus on growth drove him to expand the company rapidly. Schultz did not believe in [[franchising]], and made a point of having Starbucks retain ownership of every domestic outlet.

He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbuck's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. From 2001 to 2006, he owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], a basketball franchise that he sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who moved the team to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open ''Il Giornale'', a specialty coffeeshop that quickly merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Shultz pushed the new company to sell more than [[Coffee bean|coffee beans]] and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served [[espresso]], [[coffee]], teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became [[List of coffeehouse chains|the largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Shultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbuck's international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. He led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. Shultz orchestrated multiple [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] of American and Chinese beverage companies and introduced a national [[loyalty program]]. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling [[Chinese tea culture|the country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub is widely seen as introducing [[Third wave of coffee#History|the second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in Seattle. His second tenure sustained both [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant criticism]] and growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nSchultz was named the [[The World's Billionaires|145th-richest person in the United States]] by ''Forbes'' in 2019 with a [[net worth]] of $4.1 billion (November 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-schultz/#6de1621452c6|title=Howard Schultz|website=Forbes|access-date=April 2, 2019|language=en}}</ref> He is the author of [[Howard Schultz#Books|three books]], ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|centrist]], moderate, and independent political views, Schultz explored a run in the [[2020 United States presidential election]] as an independent candidate but declined to formally join the contest for fear of re-electing [[Donald Trump]]. Schultz supports nonpartisan immigration policy, [[free trade]], [[Balanced budget|fiscal discipline]], comprehensive tax reform, gun control, same-sex marriage, and more generally, [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum.

He learned that they not only served excellent [[espresso]], they also served as meeting places or public squares; the 200,000 caf\u00e9s in the country were an important element of Italian culture and society. On his return, he tried to persuade the owners (including cofounder [[Jerry Baldwin]]) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide, saying they did not want to get into the restaurant business. Frustrated, Schultz decided to leave Starbucks in 1985. He needed $400,000 to open the first store and start the business. He did not have the money and his wife was pregnant with their first baby. Jerry Baldwin and Starbucks cofounder [[Gordon Bowker]] offered to help. Schultz also received $100,000 from a doctor who was impressed by Schultz's energy to \"take a gamble\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullins|first=John|title=The New Business Road Test|url=https://archive.org/details/newbusinessroadt0000mull|url-access=registration|year=2007}}</ref> By 1986, he had raised all the money he needed to open the first store, \"Il Giornale\", named after [[Il Giornale|the Milanese newspaper]] of the same name. The store offered ice cream in addition to coffee, had little seating, and played opera music in the background to portray an Italian experience. Two years later, the original Starbucks management decided to focus on [[Peet's Coffee & Tea]] and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale for US$3.8&nbsp;million.\n\nSchultz renamed ''Il Giornale'' with the Starbucks name, and aggressively expanded its reach across the United States. Schultz's insight in real estate and his hard-line focus on growth drove him to expand the company rapidly. Schultz did not believe in [[franchising]], and made a point of having Starbucks retain ownership of every domestic outlet. On June 26, 1992, Starbucks had its initial public offering and trading of its common stock under the stock ticker SBUX. The offering was done by Alex, Brown & Sons Inc. and Wertheim Schroder & Co.
