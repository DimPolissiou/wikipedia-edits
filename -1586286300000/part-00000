This reactor was designed and is used to test nuclear fuels and materials to be used in power plants, naval propulsion, research and advanced reactors. It can operate at a maximum thermal power of 250 MW and has a \"Four Leaf Clover\" core design (similar to the [[Camunian rose]]) that allows for a variety of testing locations. The unique design allows for different [[neutron flux]] (number of neutrons impacting one square centimeter every second) conditions in various locations. Six of the test locations allow an experiment to be isolated from the primary cooling system, providing its own environment for temperature, pressure, flow and chemistry, replicating the physical environment while accelerating the nuclear conditions.\n\nThe ATR is a pressurized light water reactor (LWR), using water as both coolant and moderator. The core is surrounded by a [[beryllium]] [[neutron reflector]] to concentrate neutrons on experiments, and houses multiple experiment positions as well. It operates at low temperature and pressure 71\u00b0C (160\u00b0F) and up to 2.69 MPa water pressure. The ATR reactor vessel is solid stainless steel, {{convert|35|ft}} tall by {{convert|12|ft}} across. The core is approximately {{convert|4|ft}} tall by {{convert|4|ft}} across.\n\nIn addition to its role in nuclear fuels and materials irradiation, the ATR is the United States' only domestic source of high specific activity (HSA) [[cobalt-60]] (<sup>60</sup>Co) for medical applications. HSA <sup>60</sup>Co is used primarily in [[gamma knife]] treatment of brain cancer. Other medical and industrial isotopes have also been produced, and could be again, including [[plutonium-238]] (<sup>238</sup>Pu), which is useful for powering spacecraft.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Advanced Test Reactor.jpg|ATR core, powered up.

It can be brought online and powered down safely as often as necessary to change experiments or perform maintenance. The reactor is also powered down automatically in the event of abnormal experimental conditions or power failure.\n\nComponents of the reactor core are replaced every 7\u201310 years to prevent [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] due to exposure to radiation and to ensure experimenters always have a new reactor to work with.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. To give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Dean Boys' History of EC-121|url =http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm|website = www.dean-boys.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Air Base]], took off from [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] on a training flight.

All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">[https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670 Aviation Safety Org Mishap Database]</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref>http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp</ref> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Dean Boys' History of EC-121|url =http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm|website = www.dean-boys.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Air Base]], took off from [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] on a training flight.

The main fuselage and tail section crashed southwest of [[Markt Schwaben]].<ref name=\"StaHypo\">{{Cite web|title =History Of VQ-2.

All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">[https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670 Aviation Safety Org Mishap Database]</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref>http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp</ref> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

In 1947, Hiller patented the idea of using an electron beam to produce analytical X-rays, but never constructed a working model. His design proposed using [[Bragg diffraction]] from a flat crystal to select specific X-ray wavelengths and a photographic plate as a detector.\n\nIn 1948\u20131950, [[:fr:Raimond Castaing|Raymond Castaing]], supervised by [[Andr\u00e9 Guinier]], built the first electron \u201cmicrosonde \u00e9lectronique\u201d (electron microprobe) at [[Office national d'\u00e9tudes et de recherches a\u00e9rospatiales|ONERA]]. This microprobe produced an electron beam diameter of 1-3 \u03bcm with a beam current of ~10 nanoamperes (nA) and used a Geiger counter to detect the X-rays produced from the sample. However, the Geiger counter could not distinguish X-rays produced from specific elements and in 1950, Castaing added a [[quartz]] crystal between the sample and the detector to permit wavelength discrimination. He also added an optical microscope to view the point of beam impact. The resulting microprobe was described in Castaing's 1951 PhD Thesis,<ref>{{Cite thesis|last=Castaing |first=Raimond |type=PhD Thesis |title=Application des sondes \u00e9lectroniques \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode d'analyse ponctuelle chimique et cristallographique: publication ONERA (Office national d'\u00e9tudes et de recherches a\u00e9ronautiques/ Institute for Aeronautical Research) N. 55 |publisher=University of Paris |origyear=Submitted 1951 |date=1952|title-link=Office national d'\u00e9tudes et de recherches a\u00e9rospatiales }}</ref> in which he laid the foundations of the theory and application of quantitative analysis by electron microprobe, establishing the theoretical framework for the matrix corrections of absorption and fluorescence effects. Castaing (1921-1999) is considered the \"father\" of electron microprobe analysis.\n\n[[CAMECA]] (France) produced the first commercial microprobe, the \u201cMS85,\u201d in 1956.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} It was soon followed by many microprobes from other companies; however, all companies except [[CAMECA]] , [[JEOL]] and [[Shimadzu Corporation]] are now out of business. In addition, many researchers build electron microprobes in their labs. Significant subsequent improvements and modifications to microprobes included scanning the electron beam to make X-ray maps (1960), the addition of solid state EDS detectors (1968) and the development of synthetic multilayer diffracting crystals for analysis of light elements (1984). Later, [[CAMECA]] became also the pioneer on manufacturing a shielded version of the electron microprobe for [[nuclear reactor|nuclear]] applications. Several new advances in [[CAMECA]] instruments in the last decades allowed them to expand their range of applications on [[metallurgy]], [[electronics]], [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[nuclear plant]]s, [[trace element]]s, [[dentistry]], etc.\n\n==Working==\nA beam of electrons is fired at a sample.

The anode plate has central aperture and electrons that pass through it are collimated and focused by a series of magnetic lenses and apertures. The resulting electron beam (approximately 5&nbsp;nm to 10 \u03bcm diameter) may be rastered across the sample or used in spot mode to produce excitation of various effects in the sample. Among these effects are: [[phonon]] excitation (heat), [[cathodoluminescence]] (visible light fluorescence), continuum X-ray radiation ([[bremsstrahlung]]), characteristic X-ray radiation, secondary electrons ([[plasmon]] production), backscattered electron production, and [[Auger electron]] production.\n\nWhen the beam electrons (and scattered electrons from the sample) interact with bound electrons in the innermost electron shells of the atoms of the various elements in the sample, they can scatter the bound electrons from the electron shell producing a vacancy in that shell (ionization of the atom). This vacancy is unstable and must be filled by an electron from either a higher energy bound shell in the atom (producing another vacancy which is in turn filled by electrons from yet higher energy bound shells) or by unbound electrons of low energy. The difference in binding energy between the electron shell in which the vacancy was produced and the shell from which the electron comes to fill the vacancy is emitted as a photon. The energy of the photon is in the X-ray region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. As the electron structure of each element is unique, the series X-ray line energies produced by vacancies in the innermost shells is characteristic of that element, although lines from different elements may overlap. As the innermost shells are involved, the X-ray line energies are generally not affected by chemical effects produced by bonding between elements in compounds except in low atomic number (Z) elements ( B, C, N, O and F for K<sub>alpha</sub> and Al to Cl for K<sub>beta</sub>) where line energies may be shifted as a result of the involvement of the electron shell from which vacancies are filled in chemical bonding.\n\nThe characteristic X-rays are used for chemical analysis. Specific X-ray wavelengths or energies are selected and counted, either by [[wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (WDS) or [[energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS). WDS utilizes [[Bragg diffraction]] from crystals to select X-ray wavelengths of interest and direct them to gas-flow or sealed proportional detectors. In contrast, EDS uses a solid state [[semiconductor detector]] to accumulate X-rays of all wavelengths produced from the sample. While EDS yields more information and typically requires a much shorter counting time, WDS is generally a more precise technique with lower limits of detection because its superior X-ray peak resolution and greater peak to background ratio.\n\nChemical composition is determined by comparing the intensities of characteristic X-rays from the sample material with intensities from known composition (standards). Counts from the sample must be corrected for [[matrix effect]]s (depth of production of the X-rays,<ref>Duncumb P. and Reed S.J.B., NBS Spec.

Variations in chemical composition within a material (zoning), such as a mineral grain or metal, can be readily determined.\n\nVolume from which chemical information is gathered (volume of X-rays generation) is 0.3 \u2013 3 cubic micrometers.\n\n=== Limitations ===\n* WDS is useful for higher atomic numbers, therefore WDS cannot determine elements below number 5 (boron). This limitation sets restrictions to WDS when analyzing geologically important elements such as H, Li, and Be.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/wds.html|title=Wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS)|website=Geochemical Instrumentation and Analysis|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref> \n* Despite the improved spectral resolution of elemental peaks, some peaks exhibit significant overlaps that result in analytical challenges (e.g., VK\u03b1 and TiK\u03b2). WDS analyses are not able to distinguish among the valence states of elements (e.g. Fe<sup>2+</sup> vs. Fe<sup>3+</sup>) such that this information must be obtained by other techniques (e.g. [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy]] or [[Electron energy loss spectroscopy]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/wds.html|title=Wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS)|website=Geochemical Instrumentation and Analysis|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref> \n* The multiple masses of an element (i.e. isotopes) cannot be determined by WDS, but rather are most commonly obtained with a [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/wds.html|title=Wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS)|website=Geochemical Instrumentation and Analysis|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Materials science and engineering===\n[[Image:1886VE10-SEM-HD.jpg|thumb|A section of the 1886VE10 [[microcontroller]] [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] as seen by an electron microprobe.

It is particularly useful for assessing the composition of individual particles or grains and chemical changes on the scale of a few micrometres to millimeters. The electron microprobe is widely used for research, quality control, and failure analysis.\n\n===Mineralogy and petrology ===\n\nThis technique is most commonly used by mineralogists and petrologists. Most rocks are aggregates of small mineral grains. These grains may preserve chemical information adopted during their formation and subsequent alteration. This information may illuminate geologic processes, such as crystallization, lithification, volcanism, metamorphism, orogenic events (mountain building), plate tectonics. This technique is also used for the study of extraterrestrial rocks (i.e. meteorites), and provides chemical data which is vital to understanding the evolution of the planets, asteroids, and comets.\n\nThe change in elemental composition from the center (also known as core) to the edge (or rim) of a mineral can yield information about the history of the crystal's formation, including the temperature, pressure, and chemistry of the surrounding medium. Quartz crystals, for example, incorporate a small, but measurable amount of titanium into their structure as a function of temperature, pressure, and the amount of titanium available in their environment. Changes in these parameters are recorded by titanium as the crystal grows.\n\n===Palaeontology===\nIn exceptionally preserved fossils, such as those of the [[Burgess shale]], soft parts of organisms may be preserved. Since these fossils are often compressed into a 2D film, it can be difficult to deduce what features were what: a famous example is that of triangular extensions in ''[[Opabinia]]'', which were interpreted as either legs or extensions of the gut. Elemental mapping showed that they had a similar composition to the gut, favouring the second interpretation.<ref name=\"ZhangBriggs2007\">{{ cite journal \n|author1=Zhang, X. |author2=Briggs, D.E.G. | year=2007 \n| title=The nature and significance of the appendages of ''Opabinia'' from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale \n| journal=Lethaia | volume=40 | issue=2 | pages=161\u2013173 | doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.2007.00013.x \n| url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117996987/abstract | archive-url=https://archive.today/20121208233627/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117996987/abstract | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-12-08 | accessdate=2008-08-20 \n}}</ref> Because of the thin nature of the carbon films, only low voltages (5-15 kV) can be used in such specimens.<ref name=Orr2009>{{Cite journal| last1 = Orr | first1 = P.

This enables the abundances of elements present within small sample volumes (typically 10-30 cubic [[micrometers]] or less) to be determined<ref name=\"WittryPatent\">Wittry, David B.

In 1947, Hiller patented the idea of using an electron beam to produce analytical X-rays, but never constructed a working model. His design proposed using [[Bragg diffraction]] from a flat crystal to select specific X-ray wavelengths and a photographic plate as a detector.\n\nIn 1948-1950, [[:fr:Raimond Castaing|Raymond Castaing]], supervised by [[Andr\u00e9 Guinier]], built the first electron \u201cmicrosonde \u00e9lectronique\u201d (electron microprobe) at [[Office national d'\u00e9tudes et de recherches a\u00e9rospatiales|ONERA]]. This microprobe produced an electron beam diameter of 1-3 \u03bcm with a beam current of ~10 nanoamperes (nA) and used a Geiger counter to detect the X-rays produced from the sample. However, the Geiger counter could not distinguish X-rays produced from specific elements and in 1950, Castaing added a [[quartz]] crystal between the sample and the detector to permit wavelength discrimination. He also added an optical microscope to view the point of beam impact. The resulting microprobe was described in Castaing's 1951 PhD Thesis,<ref>{{Cite thesis|last=Castaing |first=Raimond |type=PhD Thesis |title=Application des sondes \u00e9lectroniques \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode d'analyse ponctuelle chimique et cristallographique: publication ONERA (Office national d'\u00e9tudes et de recherches a\u00e9ronautiques/ Institute for Aeronautical Research) N. 55 |publisher=University of Paris |origyear=Submitted 1951 |date=1952|title-link=Office national d'\u00e9tudes et de recherches a\u00e9rospatiales }}</ref> in which he laid the foundations of the theory and application of quantitative analysis by electron microprobe, establishing the theoretical framework for the matrix corrections of absorption and fluorescence effects. Castaing (1921-1999) is considered the \"father\" of electron microprobe analysis.\n\n[[CAMECA]] (France) produced the first commercial microprobe, the \u201cMS85,\u201d in 1956.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} It was soon followed by many microprobes from other companies; however, all companies except [[CAMECA]] , [[JEOL]] and [[Shimadzu Corporation]] are now out of business. In addition, many researchers build electron microprobes in their labs. Significant subsequent improvements and modifications to microprobes included scanning the electron beam to make X-ray maps (1960), the addition of solid state EDS detectors (1968) and the development of synthetic multilayer diffracting crystals for analysis of light elements (1984). Later, [[CAMECA]] became also the pioneer on manufacturing a shielded version of the electron microprobe for [[nuclear reactor|nuclear]] applications. Several new advances in [[CAMECA]] instruments in the last decades allowed them to expand their range of applications on [[metallurgy]], [[electronics]], [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[nuclear plant]]s, [[trace element]]s, [[dentistry]], etc.\n\n==Working==\nA beam of electrons is fired at a sample.

The anode plate has central aperture and electrons that pass through it are collimated and focused by a series of magnetic lenses and apertures. The resulting electron beam (approximately 5&nbsp;nm to 10 \u03bcm diameter) may be rastered across the sample or used in spot mode to produce excitation of various effects in the sample. Among these effects are: [[phonon]] excitation (heat), [[cathodoluminescence]] (visible light fluorescence), continuum X-ray radiation ([[bremsstrahlung]]), characteristic X-ray radiation, secondary electrons ([[plasmon]] production), backscattered electron production, and [[Auger electron]] production.\n\nWhen the beam electrons (and scattered electrons from the sample) interact with bound electrons in the innermost electron shells of the atoms of the various elements in the sample, they can scatter the bound electrons from the electron shell producing a vacancy in that shell (ionization of the atom). This vacancy is unstable and must be filled by an electron from either a higher energy bound shell in the atom (producing another vacancy which is in turn filled by electrons from yet higher energy bound shells) or by unbound electrons of low energy. The difference in binding energy between the electron shell in which the vacancy was produced and the shell from which the electron comes to fill the vacancy is emitted as a photon. The energy of the photon is in the X-ray region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. As the electron structure of each element is unique, the series X-ray line energies produced by vacancies in the innermost shells is characteristic of that element, although lines from different elements may overlap. As the innermost shells are involved, the X-ray line energies are generally not affected by chemical effects produced by bonding between elements in compounds except in low atomic number (Z) elements ( B, C, N, O and F for K<sub>alpha</sub> and Al to Cl for K<sub>beta</sub>) where line energies may be shifted as a result of the involvement of the electron shell from which vacancies are filled in chemical bonding.\n\nThe characteristic X-rays are used for chemical analysis. Specific X-ray wavelengths or energies are selected and counted, either by [[wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (WDS) or [[energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS). WDS utilizes [[Bragg diffraction]] from crystals to select X-ray wavelengths of interest and direct them to gas-flow or sealed proportional detectors. In contrast, EDS uses a solid state [[semiconductor detector]] to accumulate X-rays of all wavelengths produced from the sample. While EDS yields more information and typically requires a much shorter counting time, WDS is generally a more precise technique with lower limits of detection because its superior X-ray peak resolution and greater peak to background ratio.\n\nChemical composition is determined by comparing the intensities of characteristic X-rays from the sample material with intensities from known composition (standards). Counts from the sample must be corrected for [[matrix effect]]s (depth of production of the X-rays,<ref>Duncumb P. and Reed S.J.B., NBS Spec.

Variations in chemical composition within a material (zoning), such as a mineral grain or metal, can be readily determined.\n\nVolume from which chemical information is gathered (volume of X-rays generation) is 0.3 \u2013 3 cubic micrometers.\n\n=== Limitations ===\n* WDS is useful for higher atomic numbers, therefore WDS cannot determine elements below number 5 (boron). This limitation sets restrictions to WDS when analyzing geologically important elements such as H, Li, and Be.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/wds.html|title=Wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS)|website=Geochemical Instrumentation and Analysis|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref> \n* Despite the improved spectral resolution of elemental peaks, some peaks exhibit significant overlaps that result in analytical challenges (e.g., VK\u03b1 and TiK\u03b2). WDS analyses are not able to distinguish among the valence states of elements (e.g. Fe<sup>2+</sup> vs. Fe<sup>3+</sup>) such that this information must be obtained by other techniques (e.g. [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy]] or [[Electron energy loss spectroscopy]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/wds.html|title=Wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS)|website=Geochemical Instrumentation and Analysis|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref> \n* The multiple masses of an element (i.e. isotopes) cannot be determined by WDS, but rather are most commonly obtained with a [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/wds.html|title=Wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS)|website=Geochemical Instrumentation and Analysis|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Materials science and engineering===\n[[Image:1886VE10-SEM-HD.jpg|thumb|A section of the 1886VE10 [[microcontroller]] [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] as seen by an electron microprobe.

It is particularly useful for assessing the composition of individual particles or grains and chemical changes on the scale of a few micrometres to millimeters. The electron microprobe is widely used for research, quality control, and failure analysis.\n\n===Mineralogy and petrology ===\n\nThis technique is most commonly used by mineralogists and petrologists. Most rocks are aggregates of small mineral grains. These grains may preserve chemical information adopted during their formation and subsequent alteration. This information may illuminate geologic processes, such as crystallization, lithification, volcanism, metamorphism, orogenic events (mountain building), plate tectonics. This technique is also used for the study of extraterrestrial rocks (i.e. meteorites), and provides chemical data which is vital to understanding the evolution of the planets, asteroids, and comets.\n\nThe change in elemental composition from the center (also known as core) to the edge (or rim) of a mineral can yield information about the history of the crystal's formation, including the temperature, pressure, and chemistry of the surrounding medium. Quartz crystals, for example, incorporate a small, but measurable amount of titanium into their structure as a function of temperature, pressure, and the amount of titanium available in their environment. Changes in these parameters are recorded by titanium as the crystal grows.\n\n===Palaeontology===\nIn exceptionally preserved fossils, such as those of the [[Burgess shale]], soft parts of organisms may be preserved. Since these fossils are often compressed into a 2D film, it can be difficult to deduce what features were what: a famous example is that of triangular extensions in ''[[Opabinia]]'', which were interpreted as either legs or extensions of the gut. Elemental mapping showed that they had a similar composition to the gut, favouring the second interpretation.<ref name=\"ZhangBriggs2007\">{{ cite journal \n|author1=Zhang, X. |author2=Briggs, D.E.G. | year=2007 \n| title=The nature and significance of the appendages of ''Opabinia'' from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale \n| journal=Lethaia | volume=40 | issue=2 | pages=161\u2013173 | doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.2007.00013.x \n| url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117996987/abstract | archive-url=https://archive.today/20121208233627/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117996987/abstract | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-12-08 | accessdate=2008-08-20 \n}}</ref> Because of the thin nature of the carbon films, only low voltages (5-15 kV) can be used in such specimens.<ref name=Orr2009>{{Cite journal| last1 = Orr | first1 = P.

While there on a tour, the couple gets lost in the bat cave. Dr. Beck, who specializes in bats, is bitten by a [[fruit bat]].  He then, inexplicably, begins to transform into a [[vampire bat]]. He visits a doctor who attempts to help his condition. Unfortunately the doctor's treatment does not seem to be working.  In fact, it is aggravating his condition.  As he begins to transform, Dr. Beck unwittingly goes on a killing spree, catching the attention of the cruel Sergeant Ward. The doctor begins to wonder if Dr. Beck is just imagining everything, and suggests that he seek a psychiatrist. Beck returns to the original cave to seek solace. In the end, Cathy becomes a [[vampire]] (after having sex with Beck) and rejoins her husband in the bat cave.<ref>''The Bat People''. N.p.

While there on a tour, the couple gets lost in the bat cave. Dr. Beck, who specializes in bats, is bitten by a [[fruit bat]].  He then, inexplicably, begins to transform into a [[vampire bat]]. He visits a doctor who attempts to help his condition. Unfortunately the doctor\u2019s treatment does not seem to be working.  In fact, it is aggravating his condition.  As he begins to transform, Dr. Beck unwittingly goes on a killing spree, catching the attention of the cruel Sergeant Ward. The doctor begins to wonder if Dr. Beck is just imagining everything, and suggests that he seek a psychiatrist. Beck returns to the original cave to seek solace. In the end, Cathy becomes a [[vampire]] (after having sex with Beck) and rejoins her husband in the bat cave.<ref>''The Bat People''. N.p.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft.

By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]].

Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived.

This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref>http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp</ref> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">[https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670 Aviation Safety Org Mishap Database]</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref>http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp</ref> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

The island has been an important communication highway, among others for [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]. Historically, [[sugar beet]] has been grown in Lolland. Sugar is still a major industry, visible from the large number of sugar beet fields.\n\nThe largest [[town]] of Lolland is [[Nakskov]], with 12,600 residents. Other main towns are [[Maribo]] (6,000 residents), which hosts the seat of the [[Diocese of Lolland and Falster]], [[Saksk\u00f8bing]] (3,500 residents) and [[R\u00f8dby]] (2,500 residents).\n\nSince January 1, 2007, Lolland has been administered by two municipalities, ''[[Lolland Municipality|Lolland]]'' covering the western two thirds, and ''[[Guldborgsund Municipality|Guldborgsund]]'' uniting the eastern third with the neighbouring island Falster.\n\nLolland has motor and railway links both to the island of [[Falster]] to the east and to [[Germany]] (the German island [[Fehmarn]], linked to the mainland) via ferry. [[European route E47]] links [[Copenhagen]] to [[Hamburg]] (Germany) via Lolland.\n\n==Transport==\nRoute E47 from Copenhagen crosses the [[Guldborgsund]] strait between Lolland and Falster via a modern tunnel, but the motorway currently terminates at [[R\u00f8dby#The harbour at R\u00f8dbyhavn|R\u00f8dbyhavn]] where a ferry carries vehicles and trains to Fehmarn. This ferry, in continuous service since 1963, serves 6 passenger trains per day. [[Freight trains]] and night trains do not use the ferry; they take the longer way to the mainland via the [[Great Belt Bridge]], then [[Funen]] and [[Jutland]].\n\nThe governments of Denmark and Germany plan to connect Lolland with Fehmarn by a future immersed tunnel, the [[Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link]].\n\nTwo older bridges also span the strait between Lolland and Falster, the [[Frederick IX Bridge]] and [[Guldborgsund Bridge]] at the northern end of the strait.

Frederick IX bridge is the railway bridge to Falster.\n\n==Demography==\n{{historical populations\n| align=none | cols = 3\n| 1901 | 68,331\n| 1906 | 69,738\n| 1911 | 74,063\n| 1916 | 78,193\n| 1921 | 83,188\n| 1925 | 86,544\n| 1930 | 87,534\n| 1935 | 85,607\n| 1940 | 86,307\n| 1945 | 87,230\n| 1950 | 86,490\n| 1955 | 84,781\n| 1960 | 83,170\n| 1965 | 81,760\n| 1970 | 78,934\n| 1976 | 77,958\n| 1981 | 77,431\n| 1986 | 75,278\n| 1990 | 73,191\n| 1995 | 71,610\n| 2000 | 70,640\n| 2005 | 68,751\n| 2010 | 65,764\n| 2015 | 60,896\n| 2016 | 60,607\n}}\n\n==Towns and villages==\nPopulation 1 January 2014.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:1em\"\n|-\n| [[Nakskov]] || align=\"center\"| 12,866 \n|-\n| [[Maribo]] || align=\"center\"| 5,933\n|-\n| [[Saksk\u00f8bing]] || align=\"center\"| 4.539\n|-\n| [[Sundby (Lolland)|Sundby]] || align=\"center\"| 2.847\n|-\n| [[R\u00f8dby]] || align=\"center\"| 2,092\n|-\n| [[R\u00f8dbyhavn]] || align=\"center\"| 1,634\n|-\n| [[S\u00f8llested]] || align=\"center\"| 1,458\n|-\n| [[Holeby]] || align=\"center\"| 1,423\n|-\n| [[Nysted]] || align=\"center\"| 1,336\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:1em\"\n|-\n| [[Bandholm]] || align=\"center\"| 678\n|-\n| [[Horslunde]] || align=\"center\"| 671\n|-\n| [[Toreby]] || align=\"center\"| 628\n|-\n| [[Guldborg]] || align=\"center\"| 572\n|-\n| [[Kettinge]] || align=\"center\"| 539\n|-\n| [[N\u00f8rreballe]] || align=\"center\"| 532\n|-\n| [[Nagelsti]] || align=\"center\"| 497\n|-\n| [[Stokkemarke]] || align=\"center\"| 440\n|-\n| [[Dannemare]] || align=\"center\"| 434\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:1em\"\n|-\n| [[Hunseby]] || align=\"center\"| 418\n|-\n| [[Sandby]] || align=\"center\"| 386\n|-\n| [[Gr\u00e6nge]] || align=\"center\"| 380\n|-\n| [[Lang\u00f8, Lolland]] || align=\"center\"| 319\n|-\n| [[Errindlev]] || align=\"center\"| 298\n|-\n| [[Hillested]] || align=\"center\"| 284\n|-\n| [[Ullerslev, Lolland|Ullerslev]] || align=\"center\"| 276\n|-\n| [[Frejlev, Lolland|Frejlev]] || align=\"center\"| 264\n|-\n| [[Branderslev]] || align=\"center\"| 229\n|-\n| [[Radsted]] || align=\"center\"| 215\n|-\n| [[Nordlunde]] || align=\"center\"| 100\n|}\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:Trebuchets at Middelaldercentret, 2014.JPG|thumb|[[Trebuchet]] ready for firing at [[Middelaldercentret]].]]\nAmong the attractions of the island are the 19th century [[Fuglsang Manor]], and the neighbouring [[Fuglsang Art Museum]], which opened in 2008.

The [[Pennines]] formed a formidable barrier, and the line's engineer constructed [[Woodhead Tunnel]], over {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} long. The company amalgamated with the [[Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway]] and [[Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway]] companies, together forming the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] in 1847.<ref name = dow84>George Dow, ''Great Central: volume I: The Progenitors, 1813\u20131863'', Locomotive Publishing Co Ltd, London, 1959, {{ISBN|071101468X}}, page 84</ref>\n\nIn the twentieth century the line carried an exceptionally heavy freight traffic, and it was electrified in 1954; at that time a new Woodhead Tunnel was driven. In 1974 the major part of the route was closed to passenger trains, leaving passenger operation continuing only on the Manchester - [[Hadfield, Derbyshire|Hadfield]] section, and in 1981 the line east of Hadfield closed completely. The Manchester - Hadfield - [[Glossop]] section and a Stalybridge branch remain in use.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Ashton-under-Lyne.png|thumb|The Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway on the last day of its independent existence]]At the end of the eighteenth century the need for improved transport links between Manchester and Sheffield was increasing. The canal route involved a long northwards detour through the Pennines, and the journey took eight days.<ref name = dow1>Dow, Great Central, pages 1 to 17</ref>\n\nIn 1826 a land surveyor in Sheffield, Henry Sanderson, put forward a line to Manchester via [[Edale]]. and a prospectus for a \"Sheffield and Manchester Railway\" was published in August 1830, with [[George Stephenson]] appointed to be the engineer.<ref name = first5>George Dow, ''The First Railway Across the Pennines'', published by the London and North Eastern Railway, York, 1945, page 5</ref>\n\nThere were concerns about the severity of the gradients on this line, which would involve rope-worked inclines. He suggested an alternative route, via [[Penistone]], that would involve less tunnelling, and have gentler gradients which could be worked by locomotives, but this scheme too failed to attract support.<ref name = dow1/>\n\nIn 1835 [[Charles Vignoles]] was asked to examine another route, again via Woodhead and Penistone; and a new provisional company, the \"Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway\" was formed. This line could be worked by adhesion, and required only a {{convert|2|mi|spell=in|adj=on}} tunnel. Vignoles and [[Joseph Locke]] were asked to make independent surveys, and in October met to reconcile any differences, at which time they decided that a longer tunnel at a lower level would reduce the approach gradients involved.<ref name = dow18>Dow, Great Central, pages 18 to 37</ref><ref name = first7>Dow, First Railway, page 7</ref>\n\nAfter Parliamentary expenses of \u00a318,000 ({{Inflation|UK|18000|1837|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} the line obtained its authorising Act on 5 May 1837. The only opposition came from the [[Manchester and Birmingham Railway]], with whom it was agreed that the line from [[Ardwick]] would be shared as it entered a joint station in Manchester.<ref name = dow18/><ref name = first9>Dow, First Railway, page 9</ref><ref name = grant499>Donald J Grant, ''Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain'', Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, {{ISBN|978 1785893 537}}, pages 499 and 500</ref>\n\n==Construction and first opening==\n[[File:Wardsend Viaduct, Herries Road, Sheffield - geograph.org.uk - 760177.jpg|thumb|Wardsend Viaduct, Herries Road, Sheffield, built by Joseph Locke in 1845]]\nThe first sod was cut near the western end of the Woodhead tunnel site on 1 October 1838. The following year the line had been marked out, land purchase was proceeding well, and construction had begun with [[Thomas Brassey]] as contractor. However a number of shareholders were defaulting on their payments, and there were concerns about the cost of construction. The Woodhead Tunnel would be built as a single line bore to reduce costs. The relationship between the Board and its engineer, Vignoles, was becoming strained, and Vignoles resigned. Joseph Locke agreed to act as engineer in a consultative capacity only, if the Board would appoint resident engineers for the day-to-day supervision of the work.<ref name = dow25>Dow, Great Central, pages 25 to 37</ref>\n\nIn 1841 Locke reported that construction of the tunnel would probably cost \u00a3207,000 ({{Inflation|UK|207000|1841|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} about twice the original estimate. Considerable volumes of water were encountered in the headings and more powerful pumps were acquired. In late 1841 the line was ready as far as Godley Toll Bar, a distance of {{convert|8|mi|spell=in}}, and the Directors made an experimental trip over it on 11 November 1841. The [[Board of Trade]] inspecting officer, [[Frederick Smith (Conservative MP)|Sir Frederick Smith]], passed the line as safe, and it was opened to the public on 17 November 1841. There was no opening ceremony, but each shareholder was sent a free ticket for travel on that day. The [[Manchester and Birmingham Railway]] station at Travis Street, Manchester, was used, pending the readiness of the SA&MR's own terminal. The route was single track throughout as an economy measure, at first without any intermediate passing places. It shared the final approach from Ardwick to Travis Street with the M&BR trains, on the M&BR track. Nearly 40% of gross passenger receipts were payable to the M&BR for the use of the short section of their line.<ref name = dow37>Dow, Great Central, pages 37 to 39</ref> Goods traffic was developed much more slowly.<ref name = dow42>Dow, Great Central, page 42</ref>\n\nThe arrangements for safe working at the junction seem to have been indefinite, and the Manchester Guardian observed that\n\n<blockquote>Some caution will be requisite here to prevent two trains... coming into contact at this point. This, of course, may be done by arranging the times, or by keeping the rails separate, which is indeed to be the case when the line is completed to the new Manchester station, but at the present, the proper precaution seems to be to stand a watchman there to keep a look-out on both lines, and see that when a train is arriving on one line, there is no train arriving on the other, or if there be, to make the signal to one of them to slacken speed.<ref name = ardwick>Manchester Guardian, 20 November 1841, quoted in Dow, First Railway, page 14</ref></blockquote>\n\nPermanent way maintenance was put to contract.<ref name= dow42/>\n\n==Completion of the line, and a cancelled alliance==\nThe SA&MR opened its own Store Street station in Manchester on 10 May 1842. The initial opening of a single line only proved impossibly constraining, and installation of double track was ordered early in 1842, together with construction on from Godley to Glossop. The line from Godley to Broadbottom was opened on 10 December 1842,<ref group = note>Godley Toll station was then closed.</ref> and on to a \"Glossop\" station, later to be renamed Dinting, on 24 December 1842. There were six daily trains to \"Glossop\" supplemented by four to Newton & Hyde station. There were four to Glossop on Sundays. By November 1842 the stations were Manchester (Store Street), [[Ardwick railway station|Ardwick]], [[Gorton railway station|Gorton]], [[Fairfield railway station (Greater Manchester)|Fairfield]], [[Guide Bridge railway station|Ashton]], [[Dukinfield]], [[Newton for Hyde railway station|Newton & Hyde]], [[Broadbottom railway station|Broadbottom]] and [[Dinting railway station|Glossop]]. The Dukinfield station (called Dog Lane) was closed in 1845; another station, named simply Dog Lane was opened nearby in 1846, closing in 1847. There was also a Dukinfield station on the Stalybridge branch.<ref name = quick-dukinfield>Quick,  page 152 and map 53</ref>\n\nThe main line was opened as far as Woodhead in 1844, with stations at [[Hadfield railway station|Hadfield]] and [[Woodhead, Derbyshire|Woodhead]].<ref name = dow46>Dow, Great Central, page 46</ref> Construction of Woodhead tunnel was the next hurdle, but improved pumping machinery had been installed, enabling better progress.\n\nAlliances and extensions of the network were in the minds of the directors. Encouragement was offered to a proposed Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway, to run from the SA&MR at Sheffield to [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]].<ref name = dow46+>Dow, Great Central, pages 46 and 48</ref> At the same time (1844) friendly relations with the Manchester and Birmingham Railway were further developed, and at length this led to a proposal by the M&BR with the [[Midland Railway]] to lease the SA&MR, giving those companies better access to Manchester. This seemed to be going well, and an authorising Act was passed, but the proposal was voted down in May 1845 by shareholders, who were persuaded that their line would be merely a remote satellite of the Midland Railway.<ref name = dow48>Dow, Great Central, pages 48 to 50</ref> \n\nA branch line was being built from Ashton to [[Stalybridge]]. However disaster took place: on 19 April 1845 a nine-arch viaduct under construction collapsed: 17 workmen were killed.<ref name = dow50>Dow, Great Central, page 50</ref>\n\nOn 9 June 1845 a short single line branch to Glossop was opened; powers were obtained in the 1846 Parliamentary Session of the following year to take it over from [[Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk|the Duke of Norfolk]], who had caused it to be built. The branch joined the main line facing Manchester some distance to the east of the original Glossop station, now renamed Dinting.<ref name = dow48/>\n\nThe (unconnected) eastern section of the main line was opened on 14 July 1845; there were stations at [[Dunford Bridge railway station|Dunford Bridge]], [[Penistone railway station|Penistone]], [[Wortley railway station|Wortley]], [[Deepcar railway station|Deepcar]], [[Oughtibridge railway station|Oughty Bridge]], [[Wadsley Bridge Station|Wadsley Bridge]] and a Sheffield station at [[Bridgehouses railway station|Bridgehouses]].<ref name = dow51>Dow, Great Central, pages 51 and 52</ref>\n\nFinally on 22 December 1845 Woodhead Tunnel was ready and a ceremonial opening of the entire line, including the Stalybridge branch, took place; the following day it opened to the general public. The tunnel was then the longest in the country, at 3 miles 22 yards. Two extra stations were added at the site of previous coal sidings at [[Oxspring]] and at [[Thurgoland]].<ref name = dow57>Dow, Great Central, pages 57, 59 and 60</ref>\n\nBesides Woodhead, there were short tunnels at Audenshaw Road, Hattersley (two), [[Thurgoland Tunnel|Thurgoland]] and Bridgehouses. Among the bridges the two most notable were the [[Broadbottom Viaduct|Etherow Viaduct]] and the [[Dinting Viaduct]], the latter with five central and eleven approach arches.\n\nThe completed network consisted of 40 miles of main line, {{frac|2|!|4}} miles on the Stalybridge branch and one mile on the Glossop branch.<ref name = first20>Dow, First Railway, page 20</ref>\n\n==1845: Expansion==\nThe state of the money market considerably improved in 1844 - 1845, and the [[Railway Mania]] took hold. The directors of the SA&MR saw that expansion was the way forward for the company. On 15 April 1845 a Shareholders' Meeting approved the submission of Bills for the [[Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway]], which would connect the line to the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], and the Barnsley Junction Railway, which would run from near Penistone to [[Barnsley]] and connect with the [[North Midland Railway]] at [[Royston, South Yorkshire|Royston]]. The [[Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway]], from Sheffield to Gainsborough, was already approved. Supplementing this list were proposals for lines from [[Wortley, South Yorkshire|Wortley]] through Thorncliffe to [[Chapeltown, South Yorkshire|Chapeltown]], and from [[Dukinfield]] to [[New Mills]] and on to a junction with the [[Buxton]] line of the Manchester and Birmingham Railway. The Barnsley Junction Railway might be extended to [[Pontefract]], and exploratory meetings were opened with the promoters of a Boston, Newark and Sheffield Railway, and of a Hull and Barnsley Junction Railway. Not all of these lines were later authorised.<ref name = dow75+>Dow, Great Central, pages 46, 75, 77, 80 and 81</ref>\n\nOf greatest significance was a meeting on 5 September 1845 between the SA&MR, the promoters of the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway, and the [[Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway]]; the Grimsby Docks Company was included. The outcome was agreement to amalgamate the three concerns, forming a single railway connecting Manchester and Grimsby. The idea was developed and approved by Parliament on 27 July 1846, to be effective on 1 January 1847. The combined company would be named the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway.<ref name = dow80>Dow, Great Central, pages 80 and 81</ref><ref name = grant499/>\n\n==Part of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway==\nOn the first day of existence of the new company, a half-mile connecting line from [[Bridgehouses railway station|Bridgehouses station]] to the [[Sheffield Wicker railway station|Sheffield station]] of the Midland Railway. It had originally been opened as the terminus of the [[Sheffield and Rotherham Railway]]; it was known as Sheffield Wicker station from 1852.<ref name = quick362>Quick, page 362</ref> The short steeply graded line was enclosed within a tunnel for almost its entire length, and was known locally as the ''Fiery Jack''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.burngreavemessenger.org.uk/archives/2007/june-2007-issue-70/spital-tunnel/|title=Spital Tunnel, the Fiery Jack!|last=Atkinson|first=Kate|website=archive.burngreavemessenger.org.uk|language=en|access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref> It was used for wagon transfer purposes.<ref name = dow71>Dow, Great Central, page 71</ref>\n\nThe through line required a better Sheffield station: a fine station was built, and opened on 15 September 1851, and named [[Sheffield Victoria railway station|Victoria station]].<ref name = first39>Dow, First Railway, page 39</ref>\n\nAn express passenger train service was run from Manchester to London, from 1857, in association with the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]]. A timing of 5 hours 20 minutes was operated, the same time as on the rival [[London and North Western Railway]], although that company soon accelerated its services to a speed that the MS&LR and GNR service could not match. For a time there was bitter hostility from the LNWR with some underhand tactics employed by it to discourage use of the rival service.<ref name = first41>Dow, First Railway, pages 41 and 42</ref>\n\n==Woodhead tunnel==\nThere were a number of fine viaducts on the original line, although few survived into the twentieth century in their original form. The principal engineering feature was Woodhead Tunnel. At 3 miles 22 yards in length it was the longest tunnel in the United Kingdom when built, and still the longest on the [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]] system in 1947. It was originally planned to build a double-track tunnel, but to economise as single-track bore was made. The track rose at 1 in 201 towards the east.\n\nNo less than 157 tons of gunpowder were used for blasting and eight million tons of water were pumped out, whilst the total quantity of excavation was 272,685 cubic yards, about half of this being drawn up the shafts. It was completed at a cost in the region of \u00a3200,000. The formal opening of the Woodhead tunnel and of the whole line between Manchester and Sheffield took place on Monday, 22nd December 1845, more than seven years after the first ground had been broken.<ref name = first18>Dow, First Railway, page 18</ref>\n\nSpecial precautions were taken to ensure against accidents during operation through the tunnel. An SA&MR pilot engine was stationed at the tunnel and attached to the front of every train that passed through. On the front of the engine was fixed an [[argand lamp]], with a large polished metal disc for reflection, so that a powerful beam of light was thrown forward on the track ahead. A contemporary newspaper account also stated that \"Cooke & Wheatstone's patent magnetic telegraph was being fixed in the tunnel with an index, etc., at the stations at each end, capable of being worked by the station clerks.\"\n\nThe single line through the Woodhead tunnel soon proved to be an acute bottleneck and in 1847 (after the formation of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway) work upon a second bore was begun. This new tunnel, which was to accommodate the up road, was driven alongside the original one, it opened on 2 February 1852.<ref name = first23>Dow, First Railway, pages 23 and 25</ref>\n\n==After the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire==\nThe Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway was renamed the Great Central Railway on 1 August 1897.<ref name = holt133>G O Holt revised  Gordon Biddle, ''Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume X: the North West'', David & Charles (publishers), Newton Abbot, 1986, {{ISBN|0-946537-34-8}}, page 133</ref>\n\nIn 1923 most of the main line railways of Great Britain were \"grouped\" in to one or other of four new large companies. The Great Central Railway was a constituent of the new [[London and North Eastern Railway]].\n\nIn 1936 the LNER approved a scheme for electrifying the whole line from Manchester via Sheffield to [[Darnall]], together with the branches from Guide Bridge to Ashton, from Dinting to Glossop and from Penistone to [[Wombwell]] and [[Wath upon Dearne]] - a total of 74 miles. The system chosen was 1,500\u00a0V DC with overhead wires. All freight as well as passenger traffic was to be hauled by electric traction. For many years about 80 trains travelled through the tunnel each way, each day, of which 90% were loaded or empty coal workings and ventilation was a major problem. The decision to electrify was made as much to increase line capacity as any other consideration. Electrification work was well in hand before the advent of war in 1939 stopped it. In 1946-47 each bore of Woodhead Tunnel in turn was closed for 9 months for major repairs. However, in 1948 it was decided to close them permanently and build a new double-track tunnel alongside, with enough clearance for the overhead electrification catenary. The tunnel was 3 miles 66yd long. It was opened by the Minister of Transport on 3 June 1954.

The [[Pennines]] formed a formidable barrier, and the line's engineer constructed [[Woodhead Tunnel]], over {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} long. The company amalgamated with the [[Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway]] and [[Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway]] companies, together forming the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] in 1847.<ref name = dow84>George Dow, ''Great Central: volume I: The Progenitors, 1813\u20131863'', Locomotive Publishing Co Ltd, London, 1959, {{ISBN|071101468X}}, page 84</ref>\n\nIn the twentieth century the line carried an exceptionally heavy freight traffic, and it was electrified in 1954; at that time a new Woodhead Tunnel was driven. In 1974 the major part of the route was closed to passenger trains, leaving passenger operation continuing only on the Manchester - [[Hadfield, Derbyshire|Hadfield]] section, and in 1981 the line east of Hadfield closed completely. The Manchester - Hadfield - [[Glossop]] section and a Stalybridge branch remain in use.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Ashton-under-Lyne.png|thumb|The Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway on the last day of its independent existence]]At the end of the eighteenth century the need for improved transport links between Manchester and Sheffield was increasing. The canal route involved a long northwards detour through the Pennines, and the journey took eight days.<ref name = dow1>Dow, Great Central, pages 1 to 17</ref>\n\nIn 1826 a land surveyor in Sheffield, Henry Sanderson, put forward a line to Manchester via [[Edale]]. and a prospectus for a \"Sheffield and Manchester Railway\" was published in August 1830, with [[George Stephenson]] appointed to be the engineer.<ref name = first5>George Dow, ''The First Railway Across the Pennines'', published by the London and North Eastern Railway, York, 1945, page 5</ref>\n\nThere were concerns about the severity of the gradients on this line, which would involve rope-worked inclines. He suggested an alternative route, via [[Penistone]], that would involve less tunnelling, and have gentler gradients which could be worked by locomotives, but this scheme too failed to attract support.<ref name = dow1/>\n\nIn 1835 [[Charles Vignoles]] was asked to examine another route, again via Woodhead and Penistone; and a new provisional company, the \"Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway\" was formed. This line could be worked by adhesion, and required only a {{convert|2|mi|spell=in|adj=on}} tunnel. Vignoles and [[Joseph Locke]] were asked to make independent surveys, and in October met to reconcile any differences, at which time they decided that a longer tunnel at a lower level would reduce the approach gradients involved.<ref name = dow18>Dow, Great Central, pages 18 to 37</ref><ref name = first7>Dow, First Railway, page 7</ref>\n\nAfter Parliamentary expenses of \u00a318,000 ({{Inflation|UK|18000|1837|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} the line obtained its authorising Act on 5 May 1837. The only opposition came from the [[Manchester and Birmingham Railway]], with whom it was agreed that the line from [[Ardwick]] would be shared as it entered a joint station in Manchester.<ref name = dow18/><ref name = first9>Dow, First Railway, page 9</ref><ref name = grant499>Donald J Grant, ''Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain'', Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, {{ISBN|978 1785893 537}}, pages 499 and 500</ref>\n\n==Construction and first opening==\n[[File:Wardsend Viaduct, Herries Road, Sheffield - geograph.org.uk - 760177.jpg|thumb|Wardsend Viaduct, Herries Road, Sheffield, built by Joseph Locke in 1845]]\nThe first sod was cut near the western end of the Woodhead tunnel site on 1 October 1838. The following year the line had been marked out, land purchase was proceeding well, and construction had begun with [[Thomas Brassey]] as contractor. However a number of shareholders were defaulting on their payments, and there were concerns about the cost of construction. The Woodhead Tunnel would be built as a single line bore to reduce costs. The relationship between the Board and its engineer, Vignoles, was becoming strained, and Vignoles resigned. Joseph Locke agreed to act as engineer in a consultative capacity only, if the Board would appoint resident engineers for the day-to-day supervision of the work.<ref name = dow25>Dow, Great Central, pages 25 to 37</ref>\n\nIn 1841 Locke reported that construction of the tunnel would probably cost \u00a3207,000 ({{Inflation|UK|207000|1841|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} about twice the original estimate. Considerable volumes of water were encountered in the headings and more powerful pumps were acquired. In late 1841 the line was ready as far as Godley Toll Bar, a distance of {{convert|8|mi|spell=in}}, and the Directors made an experimental trip over it on 11 November 1841. The [[Board of Trade]] inspecting officer, [[Frederick Smith (Conservative MP)|Sir Frederick Smith]], passed the line as safe, and it was opened to the public on 17 November 1841. There was no opening ceremony, but each shareholder was sent a free ticket for travel on that day. The [[Manchester and Birmingham Railway]] station at Travis Street, Manchester, was used, pending the readiness of the SA&MR's own terminal. The route was single track throughout as an economy measure, at first without any intermediate passing places. It shared the final approach from Ardwick to Travis Street with the M&BR trains, on the M&BR track. Nearly 40% of gross passenger receipts were payable to the M&BR for the use of the short section of their line.<ref name = dow37>Dow, Great Central, pages 37 to 39</ref> Goods traffic was developed much more slowly.<ref name = dow42>Dow, Great Central, page 42</ref>\n\nThe arrangements for safe working at the junction seem to have been indefinite, and the Manchester Guardian observed that\n\n<blockquote>Some caution will be requisite here to prevent two trains... coming into contact at this point. This, of course, may be done by arranging the times, or by keeping the rails separate, which is indeed to be the case when the line is completed to the new Manchester station, but at the present, the proper precaution seems to be to stand a watchman there to keep a look-out on both lines, and see that when a train is arriving on one line, there is no train arriving on the other, or if there be, to make the signal to one of them to slacken speed.<ref name = ardwick>Manchester Guardian, 20 November 1841, quoted in Dow, First Railway, page 14</ref></blockquote>\n\nPermanent way maintenance was put to contract.<ref name= dow42/>\n\n==Completion of the line, and a cancelled alliance==\nThe SA&MR opened its own Store Street station in Manchester on 10 May 1842. The initial opening of a single line only proved impossibly constraining, and installation of double track was ordered early in 1842, together with construction on from Godley to Glossop. The line from Godley to Broadbottom was opened on 10 December 1842,<ref group = note>Godley Toll station was then closed.</ref> and on to a \"Glossop\" station, later to be renamed Dinting, on 24 December 1842. There were six daily trains to \"Glossop\" supplemented by four to Newton & Hyde station. There were four to Glossop on Sundays. By November 1842 the stations were Manchester (Store Street), [[Ardwick railway station|Ardwick]], [[Gorton railway station|Gorton]], [[Fairfield railway station (Greater Manchester)|Fairfield]], [[Guide Bridge railway station|Ashton]], [[Dukinfield]], [[Newton for Hyde railway station|Newton & Hyde]], [[Broadbottom railway station|Broadbottom]] and [[Dinting railway station|Glossop]]. The Dukinfield station (called Dog Lane) was closed in 1845; another station, named simply Dog Lane was opened nearby in 1846, closing in 1847. There was also a Dukinfield station on the Stalybridge branch.<ref name = quick-dukinfield>Quick,  page 152 and map 53</ref>\n\nThe main line was opened as far as Woodhead in 1844, with stations at [[Hadfield railway station|Hadfield]] and [[Woodhead, Derbyshire|Woodhead]].<ref name = dow46>Dow, Great Central, page 46</ref> Construction of Woodhead tunnel was the next hurdle, but improved pumping machinery had been installed, enabling better progress.\n\nAlliances and extensions of the network were in the minds of the directors. Encouragement was offered to a proposed Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway, to run from the SA&MR at Sheffield to [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]].<ref name = dow46+>Dow, Great Central, pages 46 and 48</ref> At the same time (1844) friendly relations with the Manchester and Birmingham Railway were further developed, and at length this led to a proposal by the M&BR with the [[Midland Railway]] to lease the SA&MR, giving those companies better access to Manchester. This seemed to be going well, and an authorising Act was passed, but the proposal was voted down in May 1845 by shareholders, who were persuaded that their line would be merely a remote satellite of the Midland Railway.<ref name = dow48>Dow, Great Central, pages 48 to 50</ref> \n\nA branch line was being built from Ashton to [[Stalybridge]]. However disaster took place: on 19 April 1845 a nine-arch viaduct under construction collapsed: 17 workmen were killed.<ref name = dow50>Dow, Great Central, page 50</ref>\n\nOn 9 June 1845 a short single line branch to Glossop was opened; powers were obtained in the 1846 Parliamentary Session of the following year to take it over from [[Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk|the Duke of Norfolk]], who had caused it to be built. The branch joined the main line facing Manchester some distance to the east of the original Glossop station, now renamed Dinting.<ref name = dow48/>\n\nThe (unconnected) eastern section of the main line was opened on 14 July 1845; there were stations at [[Dunford Bridge railway station|Dunford Bridge]], [[Penistone railway station|Penistone]], [[Wortley railway station|Wortley]], [[Deepcar railway station|Deepcar]], [[Oughtibridge railway station|Oughty Bridge]], [[Wadsley Bridge Station|Wadsley Bridge]] and a Sheffield station at [[Bridgehouses railway station|Bridgehouses]].<ref name = dow51>Dow, Great Central, pages 51 and 52</ref>\n\nFinally on 22 December 1845 Woodhead Tunnel was ready and a ceremonial opening of the entire line, including the Stalybridge branch, took place; the following day it opened to the general public. The tunnel was then the longest in the country, at 3 miles 22 yards. Two extra stations were added at the site of previous coal sidings at [[Oxspring]] and at [[Thurgoland]].<ref name = dow57>Dow, Great Central, pages 57, 59 and 60</ref>\n\nBesides Woodhead, there were short tunnels at Audenshaw Road, Hattersley (two), [[Thurgoland Tunnel|Thurgoland]] and Bridgehouses. Among the bridges the two most notable were the [[Broadbottom Viaduct|Etherow Viaduct]] and the [[Dinting Viaduct]], the latter with five central and eleven approach arches.\n\nThe completed network consisted of 40 miles of main line, {{frac|2|!|4}} miles on the Stalybridge branch and one mile on the Glossop branch.<ref name = first20>Dow, First Railway, page 20</ref>\n\n==1845: Expansion==\nThe state of the money market considerably improved in 1844 - 1845, and the [[Railway Mania]] took hold. The directors of the SA&MR saw that expansion was the way forward for the company. On 15 April 1845 a Shareholders' Meeting approved the submission of Bills for the [[Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway]], which would connect the line to the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], and the Barnsley Junction Railway, which would run from near Penistone to [[Barnsley]] and connect with the [[North Midland Railway]] at [[Royston, South Yorkshire|Royston]]. The [[Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway]], from Sheffield to Gainsborough, was already approved. Supplementing this list were proposals for lines from [[Wortley, South Yorkshire|Wortley]] through Thorncliffe to [[Chapeltown, South Yorkshire|Chapeltown]], and from [[Dukinfield]] to [[New Mills]] and on to a junction with the [[Buxton]] line of the Manchester and Birmingham Railway. The Barnsley Junction Railway might be extended to [[Pontefract]], and exploratory meetings were opened with the promoters of a Boston, Newark and Sheffield Railway, and of a Hull and Barnsley Junction Railway. Not all of these lines were later authorised.<ref name = dow75+>Dow, Great Central, pages 46, 75, 77, 80 and 81</ref>\n\nOf greatest significance was a meeting on 5 September 1845 between the SA&MR, the promoters of the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway, and the [[Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway]]; the Grimsby Docks Company was included. The outcome was agreement to amalgamate the three concerns, forming a single railway connecting Manchester and Grimsby. The idea was developed and approved by Parliament on 27 July 1846, to be effective on 1 January 1847. The combined company would be named the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway.<ref name = dow80>Dow, Great Central, pages 80 and 81</ref><ref name = grant499/>\n\n==Part of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway==\nOn the first day of existence of the new company, a half-mile connecting line from [[Bridgehouses railway station|Bridgehouses station]] to the [[Sheffield Wicker railway station|Sheffield station]] of the Midland Railway. It had originally been opened as the terminus of the [[Sheffield and Rotherham Railway]]; it was known as Sheffield Wicker station from 1852.<ref name = quick362>Quick, page 362</ref> The short steeply graded line was enclosed within a tunnel for almost its entire length, and was known locally as the ''Fiery Jack''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.burngreavemessenger.org.uk/archives/2007/june-2007-issue-70/spital-tunnel/|title=Spital Tunnel, the Fiery Jack!|last=Atkinson|first=Kate|website=archive.burngreavemessenger.org.uk|language=en|access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref> It was used for wagon transfer purposes.<ref name = dow71>Dow, Great Central, page 71</ref>\n\nThe through line required a better Sheffield station: a fine station was built, and opened on 15 September 1851, and named [[Sheffield Victoria railway station|Victoria station]].<ref name = first39>Dow, First Railway, page 39</ref>\n\nAn express passenger train service was run from Manchester to London, from 1857, in association with the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]]. A timing of 5 hours 20 minutes was operated, the same time as on the rival [[London and North Western Railway]], although that company soon accelerated its services to a speed that the MS&LR and GNR service could not match. For a time there was bitter hostility from the LNWR with some underhand tactics employed by it to discourage use of the rival service.<ref name = first41>Dow, First Railway, pages 41 and 42</ref>\n\n==Woodhead tunnel==\nThere were a number of fine viaducts on the original line, although few survived into the twentieth century in their original form. The principal engineering feature was Woodhead Tunnel. At 3 miles 22 yards in length it was the longest tunnel in the United Kingdom when built, and still the longest on the [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]] system in 1947. It was originally planned to build a double-track tunnel, but to economise as single-track bore was made. The track rose at 1 in 201 towards the east.\n\nNo less than 157 tons of gunpowder were used for blasting and eight million tons of water were pumped out, whilst the total quantity of excavation was 272,685 cubic yards, about half of this being drawn up the shafts. It was completed at a cost in the region of \u00a3200,000. The formal opening of the Woodhead tunnel and of the whole line between Manchester and Sheffield took place on Monday, 22nd December 1845, more than seven years after the first ground had been broken.<ref name = first18>Dow, First Railway, page 18</ref>\n\nSpecial precautions were taken to ensure against accidents during operation through the tunnel. An SA&MR pilot engine was stationed at the tunnel and attached to the front of every train that passed through. On the front of the engine was fixed an [[argand lamp]], with a large polished metal disc for reflection, so that a powerful beam of light was thrown forward on the track ahead. A contemporary newspaper account also stated that \"Cooke & Wheatstone's patent magnetic telegraph was being fixed in the tunnel with an index, etc., at the stations at each end, capable of being worked by the station clerks.\"\n\nThe single line through the Woodhead tunnel soon proved to be an acute bottleneck and in 1847 (after the formation of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway) work upon a second bore was begun. This new tunnel, which was to accommodate the up road, was driven alongside the original one, it opened on 2 February 1852.<ref name = first23>Dow, First Railway, pages 23 and 25</ref>\n\n==After the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire==\nThe Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway was renamed the Great Central Railway on 1 August 1897.<ref name = holt133>G O Holt revised  Gordon Biddle, ''Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume X: the North West'', David & Charles (publishers), Newton Abbot, 1986, {{ISBN|0-946537-34-8}}, page 133</ref>\n\nIn 1923 most of the main line railways of Great Britain were \"grouped\" in to one or other of four new large companies. The Great Central Railway was a constituent of the new [[London and North Eastern Railway]].\n\nIn 1936 the LNER approved a scheme for electrifying the whole line from Manchester via Sheffield to [[Darnall]], together with the branches from Guide Bridge to Ashton, from Dinting to Glossop and from Penistone to [[Wombwell]] and [[Wath upon Dearne]] - a total of 74 miles. The system chosen was 1,500V dc with overhead wires. All freight as well as passenger traffic was to be hauled by electric traction. For many years about 80 trains travelled through the tunnel each way, each day, of which 90% were loaded or empty coal workings and ventilation was a major problem. The decision to electrify was made as much to increase line capacity as any other consideration. Electrification work was well in hand before the advent of war in 1939 stopped it. In 1946-47 each bore of Woodhead Tunnel in turn was closed for 9 months for major repairs. However, in 1948 it was decided to close them permanently and build a new double-track tunnel alongside, with enough clearance for the overhead electrification catenary. The tunnel was 3 miles 66yd long. It was opened by the Minister of Transport on 3 June 1954.
