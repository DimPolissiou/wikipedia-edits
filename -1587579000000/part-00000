The first episode originally aired on 27 June 2005.\n\n==Series overview==\nThe programme itself is designed to get viewers to focus on [[sound]]. By riding magical [[Playground slide|slide]]s directly from a blue-screen base, Razzledazzle visits four different areas, \"Rhyme Time\", \"Chit Chat\", \"Bish! Bash!

Bash! Bosh!''' features a group of '''children''' [[acting]] out simple [[rhyme]]s and sequences, sometimes set to music and beat. These rhymes are normally repeated once (hence why '''Razzledazzle''' says \u201cCome on, join in!\u201d) to encourage rhythm, syllables and rhyme. \n\nFinally, '''Once Upon A Tale''', presented alternately by '''[[Mina Anwar]]''' and '''Patrick Lynch''', is designed to create short stories using predictive and repetitive elements, widening the viewer's vocabulary and allowing for plenty of [[physicalisation]] of the [[narrator]]. \n\nAt the end of the programme, '''Razzledazzle''', the kids who appeared in the \u201cBish Bash Bosh\u201d section of the programme and the presenters from the \"Rhyme Time\" and the \"Once Upon A Tale\" segments perform '''The Not So Long Song''' composed by Ben Lee Delisle. Ten episodes at a time are usually aired for four hours during the early morning within the slot BBC [[Education]].\n\n== Episodes ==\nTwenty twenty minute long episodes of ''Razzledazzle'', which aired on [[BBC2]], [[CBeebies]] and within BBC Schools' output were produced. The series mixes [[CGI Group|CGI]] animation and live action. \n\nIn addition, some of the extras in the television series are produced using 2D [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] Animation.

Western European [[social critic]]s, including [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Louis Blanc]], [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] were the first modern socialists who criticised the excessive poverty and inequality generated by the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The term was first used in English in the British ''Cooperative Magazine'' in 1827 and came to be associated with the followers of the Owen such as the [[Rochdale Pioneers]], who founded the [[co-operative movement]]. Owen's followers stressed both [[participatory democracy]] and economic socialisation in the form of consumer [[co-operative]]s, [[credit unions]] and [[Mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] societies.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels.

In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism.{{sfn|Smitha}} Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of [[Liberal socialism|economic socialism within a liberal context]]. In later editions of ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|2ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed. [[Qantas]] introduced a similar feature to their frequent flyer program in May 2008.\n\nIn August 2011, the program was relaunched as \"Velocity Frequent Flyer\" and a platinum status level was introduced, among other changes.\n\nIn July 2013, Velocity introduced the Global Wallet function, which was the first prepaid traveller card in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/virgin-australia-s-new-global-wallet-travel-money-card |title=Virgin Australia's new Global Wallet travel money card |publisher=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> The key feature of this card is it allows you to load your money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling.

This aircraft is now in Virgin Australia livery.]]\nThe timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

The Live2Air system was only available on selected Boeing 737 aircraft, and was phased out beginning in 2012.\n\nVirgin Australia's Boeing 777-300ERs and Airbus A330-200 aircraft's in-flight entertainment ''RED'' is based on the [[Panasonic Avionics Corporation|Panasonic eX2]] system. RED is fully touch-screen and handset controlled. There is no fee for use. RED features an extensive video on demand library that includes new release film, TV series and TV programmes. Destination guides are available. Other functions available through RED include music on demand (approx 200+ CD library) and video games. Seat-to-seat chat is available as well as in flight map and flight information.\n\nIn December 2012, Virgin Australia introduced an in-flight [[Wi-Fi]] system to provide music, movies and TV shows to tablets, smartphones, laptops and similar devices. The system, which does not offer internet access, is estimated to be fitted on all the airline's planes within 2 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.domesticflightaustralia.com/news/virgin-australia-to-provide-inflight-movies-music-via-on-board-wifi-20121224.php |title=Virgin Australia to Provide Inflight Movies, Music via On-Board WiFi |date=24 December 2012 |accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Virgin Australia began upgrading the in-flight Wi-Fi system in order to offer wireless internet access.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed. [[Qantas]] introduced a similar feature to their frequent flyer program in May 2008.\n\nIn August 2011, the program was relaunched as \"Velocity Frequent Flyer\" and a platinum status level was introduced, among other changes.\n\nIn July 2013, Velocity introduced the Global Wallet function, which was the first prepaid traveller card in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/virgin-australia-s-new-global-wallet-travel-money-card |title=Virgin Australia's new Global Wallet travel money card |publisher=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> The key feature of this card is it allows you to load your money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling. You can access to ATMs around the world as well as shop at anywhere where visa is accepted. Supported currencies include Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), Japanese Yen (JPY), New Zealand Dollar (NZD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), Thai Baht (THB), US Dollar (USD) and South African Rand (ZAR). You also earn 1 Velocity Point per $1 spent overseas and 1 point per $2 spent in Australia.\n\nIn 2015, Velocity Frequent Flyer won the 'Program of the Year\" in the Middle East & Asia/Oceania District category at the Freddie Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freddieawards.com/2015-annual-freddie-awards-27th/ |title=2015 Annual Freddie Awards (27th) Results |publisher=Freddie Awards |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n* In 2003, a man with a disability and having incomplete [[quadriplegia]] was removed from a Virgin Blue flight because staff thought he was drunk or a terrorist.
