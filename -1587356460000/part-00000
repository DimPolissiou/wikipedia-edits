The failure of the tests demonstrated that the initial results were likely due to the [[Observer-expectancy effect|experimenter effect]].

There was concern on the part of ''Nature's'' editorial oversight board that the material, if published, would lend credibility to homeopathic practitioners even if the effects were not replicable.<ref name=\"time\" /> There was equal concern that the research was simply wrong, given the changes that it would demand of the known laws of physics and chemistry. The editor of ''Nature'', [[John Maddox]], stated that, \"Our minds were not so much closed as unready to change our whole view of how science is constructed.\"<ref name=\"time\" /> Rejecting the paper on any objective grounds was deemed unsupportable, as there were no methodological flaws apparent at the time.\n\nIn the end, a compromise was reached. The paper was published in ''Nature'' Vol. 333 on 30 June 1988,<ref name=\"benveniste\" /> but it was accompanied with an editorial by Maddox that noted \"There are good and particular reasons why prudent people should, for the time being, suspend judgement\" and described some of the fundamental laws of chemistry and physics which it would violate, if shown to be true.<ref name=NatureEditorial /> Additionally, Maddox demanded that the experiments be re-run under the supervision of a hand-picked group of what became known as \"ghostbusters\", including Maddox, famed magician and paranormal researcher [[James Randi]], and [[Walter W. Stewart (chemist)|Walter W.

Maddox, however, noted that during the procedure the experimenters were aware of which test tubes originally contained the antibodies and which did not. Benveniste's team then started a second, blinded experimental series with Maddox and his team in charge of the [[double-blind experiment|double-blinding]]: notebooks were photographed, the lab videotaped, and vials juggled and secretly coded.

He also pointed out that although it was true two of his team members were being paid by a homeopathic company, the same company had paid Maddox's team's hotel bill.\n\nMaddox was unapologetic, stating \"I'm sorry we didn't find something more interesting.\" On the same ''Quirks and Quarks'' show he dismissed Benveniste's complaints, stating that because of the possibility that the results would be unduly promoted by the homeopathy community, an immediate re-test was necessary. The failure of the tests demonstrated that the initial results were likely due to the [[Observer-expectancy effect|experimenter effect]]. He also pointed out that the entire test procedure that Benveniste later complained about was one that had been agreed upon in advance by all parties.

In the [[Judiciary of Belgium|Belgian criminal justice system]], an assize court is a non-permanent court that holds [[jury trial]]s on the most serious crimes. A few weeks before the actual start of the trial, a [[preliminary hearing]] took place on 20 December 2018, during which the list of [[witness]]es to be heard in the case was decided on. The [[defence attorney]]s of Nemmouche as well as Nemmouche himself opposed having his family members testify during the trial. According to Nemmouche's defence, this was because \"Mr Nemmouche did not want to argue on emotion, but on the facts\". His defence also requested to [[Adjournment|adjourn]] the case for two weeks, in order to give them the opportunity to study the case more in-depth. The adjournment of the case was rejected by the court, however. It was also decided that about 120 witnesses in total would be heard in the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|title=Geen uitstel voor proces Nemmouche over aanslag Joods museum, bijna 120 getuigen worden opgeroepen|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|date=20 December 2018|website=www.vrt.be|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=No delay for trial Nemmouche about attack on Jewish museum, almost 120 witnesses will be summoned|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221215344/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|archive-date=21 December 2018|url-status=|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 2019, three days before the start of the actual trial, the jurors on the assize jury were selected. For the [[jury selection]], 200 Belgian citizens were summoned to the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice of Brussels]], where the assize trial is held. A significant number of them asked to be exempt from [[jury duty]] for various reasons. After a dozen of juror candidates were [[Peremptory challenge|challenged]] by both the defence and the prosecution, eight men and four women were eventually empaneled as jurors. An additional twelve people, of which three men and nine women, were also selected as alternate jurors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/01/07/ik-ben-rondgeleid-door-een-slachtoffer-ik-ben-half-doof-of/|title=\"Rondleiding door slachtoffer\", \"half doof\" of \"skivakantie\": excuses om niet in jury proces-Nemmouche te moeten zitten|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|date=7 January 2019|work=www.vrt.be|access-date=8 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107202800/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/01/07/ik-ben-rondgeleid-door-een-slachtoffer-ik-ben-half-doof-of/|archive-date=7 January 2019|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=\"Guided tour by victim\", \"half deaf\" or \"skiing holiday\": excuses not to have to serve on the jury in Nemmouche trial}}</ref>\n\nHenri Laquay, the lawyer of Nemmouche, argued that Nemmouche was innocent and that he had been set up by Israeli intelligence and Belgian police.

In the reasoning the jury gave for its [[verdict]], required by Belgian law, the main evidence against Nemmouche was summed up. The evidence against Nemmouche included the fact he was carrying the weapons used in the attack with him when he was arrested in Marseille, together with the clothing the perpetrator worn as seen on the security footage from the Museum. Both the weapons and the clothing had his [[DNA]] on them, and [[gunshot residue]] was also found on the clothing in question. A [[footprint]] of the sneakers he had with him was found in front of the entrance of the Museum. When he was arrested, he was also carrying some [[electronic media]] with him, on which videos were discovered wherein Nemmouche claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]. An [[Jihadist flag|ISIS flag]] used in the videos was found along the weapons Nemmouche had with him upon his arrest. The electronic media also contained data, such as [[web browsing history]], which proved Nemmouche had been planning the attack. An eyewitness identified Nemmouche as being the perpetrator. Lastly, on a computer belonging to [[Najim Laachraoui]], one of the suicide bombers of the [[2016 Brussels bombings]], conversations were discovered wherein Nemmouche was described as a \"brother\", and plans were discussed to liberate him from his incarceration.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|title=Brussels Jewish museum terror attack: French citizen convicted|date=7 March 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190311022456/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|archive-date=11 March 2019|website=}}</ref><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite news|last=Petitjean|first=Sophie|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|title=Proc\u00e8s du Mus\u00e9e juif de Bruxelles: Nemmouche reconnu coupable de quatre assassinats terroristes|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Le Monde]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401234616/https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|archive-date=1 April 2020|language=French|trans-title=Trial over Jewish Museum of Brussels: Nemmouche found guilty of four terrorist murders}}</ref><ref name=\":22\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche schuldig aan viervoudige terroristische moord in het Joods Museum, Bendrer is mededader|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031012840/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|archive-date=31 October 2019|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche guilty of four counts of terrorist murder in Jewish Museum, Bendrer is co-author}}</ref>\n\nThe jury considered that the [[Real evidence|material evidence]] and [[eyewitness testimony]] proved Nemmouche was the perpetrator of the attack. Based on the weapons used, the security footage of the Museum, and the [[Expert witness|expert testimony]] of the [[Medical examiner|medical examiners]] who examined the bodies of the victims, the jury found Nemmouche had the [[Intention (criminal law)|intention]] to kill. The jury furthermore affirmed the premeditated nature of the killings based on the preparatory acts Nemmouche carried out, such as the procurement of the weapons he used. The terrorist intentions of Nemmouche were upheld based on his [[Jihadism|jihadist]] stay in [[Syria]] from 2012 to 2014, the videos he made in which he claimed responsibility for the attacks in the name of ISIS, and the conversations about Nemmouche retained from Najim Laachraoui's computer. The verdict also rejected the claim that Nemmouche was set up by intelligence officials. The jury lamented that the defence did not bring forward any element that would support those allegations. The existence of a setup was therefor deemed to lack \"sufficient plausibility and credibility\".<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\n==== Nacer Bendrer ====\nAside from Nemmouche, the jury also found Nacer Bendrer guilty of being the co-author, and not just the [[accomplice]], of the terrorist attack by supplying the weapons and ammunitions Nemmouche used. According to Belgian law, being the co-author of a crime means that one's aid was indispensable in the commission of the crime, i.e. that the crime would not have happened without this aid. The verdict stated Bendrer was aware of Nemmouche's [[Radicalization|radicalisation]] and adherence to [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremist beliefs]] from when they got to know each other in 2008, during their incarceration in [[Salon-de-Provence]], France. Telephone data showed that, after having had no contact for four years, Nemmouche sought contact again with Bendrer on 9 April 2014, after which Bendrer traveled to Brussels a few days later. After numerous contacts since, Nemmouche traveled to Bendrer's hometown [[Marseille]], France on 24 April 2014, and telephone data pinpointed him in the area of Bendrer's home around that time. After Nemmouche's return to Brussels, all contact ceased between them two. Investigators testified they took steps to hide their communications and encounters, by for example switching between multiple phone numbers and [[SIM card|SIM cards]].<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\nThe jury concluded their encounters could only have served to provide Nemmouche with weapons, because of the absence of any other plausible reason Bendrer had to travel to Brussels, because of the absence of any other source where Nemmouche could have procured the weapons from, and because Bendrer had later also admitted to investigators to have supplied Nemmouche with the weapons. As to the defence's argument that Bendrer did not know to which crime he would contribute, the jury retorted that Bendrer wilfully omitted to inform himself. The jury found that Bendrer should have known the weapons would be used to perform a terrorist act, based on their nature and based on the radicalisation of Nemmouche that Bendrer was aware of.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\n=== Sentence ===\nBoth men were sentenced on 12 March 2019: Nemmouche was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], while Bendrer received a 15-year prison sentence. In addition, Nemmouche was sentenced to a 15-year period of judicial surveillance. This provision means that if he would ever be released on [[parole]], he would be monitored by a sentence enforcement court, which could potentially order his incarceration for an additional 15 years. Bendrer was also sentenced to a 5-year period of such judicial surveillance.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47533533|title=Brussels Jewish Museum murders: Mehdi Nemmouche jailed for life|date=12 March 2019|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=15 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":02\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/11/nemmouche-en-bendrer-veroordeeld/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche krijgt levenslang voor aanslag op Joods Museum, mededader Nacer Bendrer 15 jaar|date=12 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche gets life sentence for attack on Jewish Museum, accomplice Nacer Bendrer 15 years}}</ref>\n\nIn its judgment, the court stated that the terrorist attack on the Jewish Museum constituted an attack on the fundamental values of Belgian society, in particular the [[Freedom of religion in Belgium|freedom of religion]] of the Jewish community of Belgium. The court considered Nemmouche's troubled upbringing to be no [[Mitigating factor|mitigating circumstance]] for such a grave act, and it also took into account the violent nature of the murders, Nemmouche's rejection of the [[Rechtsstaat|''rechtsstaat'']], and his complete lack of empathy and respect for his victims, amongst other factors. According to the court, he presented a high risk of [[recidivism]]. Regarding Bendrer on the other hand, the court described him as having played a decisive role in the attack by supplying the weapons used to Nemmouche. The court considered he knew what they would be used for, and was indifferent to the consequences to others. However, the court also upheld some mitigating circumstances, such as Bendrer having steered clear of any Islamic extremism since his arrest, and him having shown empathy and regret for the victims. Bendrer was deemed to present a low risk of recidivism.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Damages ===\nBendrer later lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction with the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]]. This meant the civil part of the proceedings before the court of assizes (without the jury) with regards to [[damages]] had to be postponed. On 18 September 2019, the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal, which established the criminal sentence as final.<ref>{{cite

A few weeks before the actual start of the trial, a [[preliminary hearing]] took place on 20 December 2018, during which the list of [[witness]]es to be heard in the case was decided on. The [[defence attorney]]s of Nemmouche as well as Nemmouche himself opposed having his family members testify during the trial. According to Nemmouche's defence, this was because \"Mr Nemmouche did not want to argue on emotion, but on the facts\". His defence also requested to [[Adjournment|adjourn]] the case for two weeks, in order to give them the opportunity to study the case more in-depth. The adjournment of the case was rejected by the court, however. It was also decided that about 120 witnesses in total would be heard in the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|title=Geen uitstel voor proces Nemmouche over aanslag Joods museum, bijna 120 getuigen worden opgeroepen|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|date=20 December 2018|website=www.vrt.be|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=No delay for trial Nemmouche about attack on Jewish museum, almost 120 witnesses will be summoned|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221215344/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|archive-date=21 December 2018|url-status=|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 2019, three days before the start of the actual trial, the jurors on the assize jury were selected.

In the reasoning the jury gave for its [[verdict]], required by Belgian law, the main evidence against Nemmouche was summed up. The evidence against Nemmouche included the fact he was carrying the weapons used in the attack with him when he was arrested in Marseille, together with the clothing the perpetrator worn as seen on the security footage from the Museum. Both the weapons and the clothing had his [[DNA]] on them, and [[gunshot residue]] was also found on the clothing in question. A [[footprint]] of the sneakers he had with him was found in front of the entrance of the Museum. When he was arrested, he was also carrying some [[electronic media]] with him, on which videos were discovered wherein Nemmouche claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]. An [[Jihadist flag|ISIS flag]] used in the videos was found along the weapons Nemmouche had with him upon his arrest. The electronic media also contained data, such as [[web browsing history]], which proved Nemmouche had been planning the attack. An eyewitness identified Nemmouche as being the perpetrator. Lastly, on a computer belonging to [[Najim Laachraoui]], one of the suicide bombers of the [[2016 Brussels bombings]], conversations were discovered wherein Nemmouche was described as a \"brother\", and plans were discussed to liberate him from his incarceration.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|title=Brussels Jewish museum terror attack: French citizen convicted|date=7 March 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190311022456/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|archive-date=11 March 2019|website=}}</ref><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite news|last=Petitjean|first=Sophie|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|title=Proc\u00e8s du Mus\u00e9e juif de Bruxelles: Nemmouche reconnu coupable de quatre assassinats terroristes|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Le Monde]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401234616/https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|archive-date=1 April 2020|language=French|trans-title=Trial over Jewish Museum of Brussels: Nemmouche found guilty of four terrorist murders}}</ref><ref name=\":22\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche schuldig aan viervoudige terroristische moord in het Joods Museum, Bendrer is mededader|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031012840/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|archive-date=31 October 2019|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche guilty of four counts of terrorist murder in Jewish Museum, Bendrer is co-author}}</ref>\n\nThe jury considered that the [[Real evidence|material evidence]] and [[eyewitness testimony]] proved Nemmouche was the perpetrator of the attack. Based on the weapons used, the security footage of the Museum, and the [[Expert witness|expert testimony]] of the [[Medical examiner|medical examiners]] who examined the bodies of the victims, the jury found Nemmouche had the [[Intention (criminal law)|intention]] to kill. The jury furthermore affirmed the premeditated nature of the killings based on the preparatory acts Nemmouche carried out, such as the procurement of the weapons he used. The terrorist intentions of Nemmouche were upheld based on his [[Jihadism|jihadist]] stay in [[Syria]] from 2012 to 2014, the videos he made in which he claimed responsibility for the attacks in the name of ISIS, and the conversations about Nemmouche retained from Najim Laachraoui's computer. The verdict also rejected the claim that Nemmouche was set up by intelligence officials. The jury lamented that the defence did not bring forward any element that would support those allegations. The existence of a setup was therefor deemed to lack \"sufficient plausibility and credibility\".<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\n==== Nacer Bendrer ====\nAside from Nemmouche, the jury also found Nacer Bendrer guilty of being the co-author, and not just the [[accomplice]], of the terrorist attack by supplying the weapons and ammunitions Nemmouche used. According to Belgian law, being the co-author of a crime means that one's aid was indispensable in the commission of the crime, i.e. that the crime would not have happened without this aid. The verdict stated Bendrer was aware of Nemmouche's [[Radicalization|radicalisation]] and adherence to [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremist beliefs]] from when they got to know each other in 2008, during their incarceration in [[Salon-de-Provence]], [[France]]. Telephone data showed that, after having had no contact for four years, Nemmouche sought contact again with Bendrer on 9 April 2014, after which Bendrer traveled to Brussels a few days later. After numerous contacts since, Nemmouche traveled to Bendrer's hometown [[Marseille]] on 24 April 2014, and telephone data pinpointed him in the area of Bendrer's home around that time. After Nemmouche's return to Brussels, all contact ceased between them two. Investigators testified they took steps to hide their communications and encounters, by for example switching between multiple phone numbers and [[SIM card|SIM cards]].<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\nThe jury concluded their encounters could only have served to provide Nemmouche with weapons, because of the absence of any other plausible reason Bendrer had to travel to Brussels, because of the absence of any other source where Nemmouche could have procured the weapons from, and because Bendrer had later also admitted to investigators to have supplied Nemmouche with the weapons. As to the defence's argument that Bendrer did not know to which crime he would contribute, the jury retorted that Bendrer wilfully omitted to inform himself. The jury found that Bendrer should have known the weapons would be used to perform a terrorist act, based on their nature and based on the radicalisation of Nemmouche that Bendrer was aware of.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted2\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\n=== Sentence ===\nBoth men were sentenced on 12 March 2019: Nemmouche was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], while Bendrer received a 15-year prison sentence. In addition, Nemmouche was sentenced to a 15-year period of judicial surveillance. This provision means that if he would ever be released on [[parole]], he would be monitored by a sentence enforcement court, which could potentially order his incarceration for an additional 15 years. Bendrer was also sentenced to a 5-year period of such judicial surveillance.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47533533|title=Brussels Jewish Museum murders: Mehdi Nemmouche jailed for life|date=12 March 2019|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=15 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":02\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/11/nemmouche-en-bendrer-veroordeeld/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche krijgt levenslang voor aanslag op Joods Museum, mededader Nacer Bendrer 15 jaar|date=12 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche gets life sentence for attack on Jewish Museum, accomplice Nacer Bendrer 15 years}}</ref>\n\nIn its judgment, the court stated that the terrorist attack on the Jewish Museum constituted an attack on the fundamental values of Belgian society, in particular the [[Freedom of religion in Belgium|freedom of religion]] of the Jewish community of Belgium. The court considered Nemmouche's troubled upbringing to be no [[Mitigating factor|mitigating circumstance]] for such a grave act, and it also took into account the violent nature of the murders, Nemmouche's rejection of the [[Rechtsstaat|''rechtsstaat'']], and his complete lack of empathy and respect for his victims, amongst other factors. According to the court, he presented a high risk of [[recidivism]]. Regarding Bendrer on the other hand, the court described him as having played a decisive role in the attack by supplying the weapons used to Nemmouche. The court considered he knew what they would be used for, and was indifferent to the consequences to others. However, the court also upheld some mitigating circumstances, such as Bendrer having steered clear of any Islamic extremism since his arrest, and him having shown empathy and regret for the victims. Bendrer was deemed to present a low risk of recidivism.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Damages ===\nBendrer later lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction with the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]]. This meant the civil part of the proceedings before the court of assizes (without the jury) with regards to [[damages]] had to be postponed. On 18 September 2019, the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal, which established the criminal sentence as final.<ref>{{cite
