They compete in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) as a member of the [[Central Division (NHL)|Central Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]]. The team was founded during the [[1967 NHL expansion]] as the [[Minnesota North Stars]], based in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]]. Before the beginning of the [[1978\u201379 NHL season]], the team merged with the [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]] after the league granted them permission due to each team's respective financial struggles. Ultimately, the franchise relocated to Dallas for the [[1993\u201394 NHL season]]. The Stars played out of [[Reunion Arena]] from their relocation until 2001, when the team moved less than 1.5 miles into the [[American Airlines Center]].\n\nThe Stars have won eight division titles in Dallas, two [[Presidents' Trophy|Presidents' Trophies]] as the top regular season team in the league, the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] championship twice, and in [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399]], the [[Stanley Cup]]. [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] won the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the most valuable player of the playoffs that year.\n\nIn 2000, [[Neal Broten]] was inducted into the [[United States Hockey Hall of Fame]]. In 2009, [[Brett Hull]] became the first Dallas Stars player inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], followed by [[Ed Belfour]] and Joe Nieuwendyk in 2011 and [[Mike Modano]] in 2014. In 2010, brothers [[Derian Hatcher|Derian]] and [[Kevin Hatcher]] were inducted to the [[United States Hockey Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Franchise history==\n===Minnesota North Stars (1967\u20131993)===\n{{Main|Minnesota North Stars}}\nThe Minnesota North Stars began play in [[1967\u201368 NHL season|1967]] as part of the league's [[1967 NHL Expansion|six-team expansion]]. Home games were played at the newly constructed Metropolitan Sports Center (\"[[Met Center]]\") in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]]. Initially successful both on the ice and at the gate, the North Stars fell victim to financial problems after several poor seasons in the mid-1970s.\n\n[[File:Minnesota North Stars Logo 1991-1993.svg|thumb|left|The logo of the [[Minnesota North Stars]] from 1991 to 1993. When the team moved to Dallas in 1993, it used a similar logo, usually with the word \"DALLAS\" above \"STARS,\" until 2013.]]\nIn [[1978\u201379 NHL season|1978]], the North Stars merged with the [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]] (formerly the [[California Golden Seals]]), owned by [[George Gund III|George III]] and [[Gordon Gund]]. With both teams on the verge of folding, the league permitted the two failing franchises to merge. The merged team continued as the Minnesota North Stars, while the Seals/Barons franchise records were retired. However, the Gunds were the merged team's principal owners, and the North Stars assumed the Barons' place in the [[Adams Division]] in order to balance out the divisions. The merger brought with it a number of talented players, and the North Stars were revived\u2014they reached the [[Stanley Cup]] Finals in [[1980\u201381 NHL season|1981]], where they lost in five games to the [[New York Islanders]]. However, by the early 1990s, declining attendance and the inability to secure a new downtown revenue-generating arena led ownership to request permission to move the team to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 1990. The league rejected the request and instead agreed to award an [[expansion team|expansion franchise]], the [[San Jose Sharks]], to the Gund brothers. The North Stars were sold to a group of investors that were originally looking to place a team in San Jose, although one of the group's members, former [[Calgary Flames]] part-owner [[Norman Green]], would eventually gain control of the team.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cameron|first=Steve|title=Feeding Frenzy! The Wild New World of the San Jose Sharks|pages=29\u201338|year=1994|publisher=Taylor Publishing Co.}}</ref> In the following season, the North Stars made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, only to lose to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].\n\nAfter the 1990\u201391 season, the North Stars suffered through poor attendance and declining profits. The team's fortunes were further impeded by the terms of the settlement with the Gund brothers, in which they were permitted to take a number of North Stars players to San Jose. Green explored the possibility of moving the team to [[Anaheim]], however the league decided instead to place the expansion [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks]] there in 1993\u201394. In their final two seasons in Minnesota, the team adopted a new logo which omitted the \"North\" from \"North Stars\", leading many fans to anticipate the team heading south.<ref name=\"dmagazine1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dmagazine.com/Home/D_Magazine/2010/January/The_35_Biggest_Moments_in_Modern_Dallas_History_11.aspx |title=The 35 Biggest Moments in Modern Dallas History |publisher=Dmagazine.com |accessdate=2011-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520003803/http://www.dmagazine.com/Home/D_Magazine/2010/January/The_35_Biggest_Moments_in_Modern_Dallas_History_11.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Relocation and early years in Dallas (1993\u20131998)===\n[[File:Reunion Arena.jpg|thumb|[[Reunion Arena]] was the first home for the Stars in Dallas. The arena was the Stars\u2019 home from 1993 to 2001.]]\nIn 1993, amid further attendance woes and bitter personal controversy, Green obtained permission from the league to move the team to Dallas, for the [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993\u201394 season]], with the decision announced on March 10, 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/patrick-plus-thanks-norm-green/265064341/|title=Patrick Plus: Thanks, Norm Green|website=Star Tribune|access-date=2016-04-14}}</ref> Green was convinced by former [[Dallas Cowboys]] quarterback [[Roger Staubach]] that Dallas would be a suitable market for an NHL team.<ref name=\"dmagazine1\"/> He decided to retain the \"Stars\" nickname, as it matched Texas' official nickname as \"The Lone Star State.\" The Stars would move into [[Reunion Arena]], built in 1980, the downtown arena already occupied by the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Dallas Mavericks]].\n\nTo quell the ensuing controversy, the NHL promised that the Twin Cities would receive an expansion franchise in the future; that promise was fulfilled in 2000 in the form of the [[Minnesota Wild]].\n\nWith the league changing the names of the conferences and divisions that season, the newly relocated Stars were placed in the Central Division of the Western Conference, and played their first game in Dallas on October 5, 1993, a 6\u20134 win against the [[Detroit Red Wings]].<ref>[https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DAL/1994_games.html 1993-94 Dallas Stars Schedule and Results]. hockey-reference.com</ref> In that game, [[Neal Broten]] scored the first Stars goal in Dallas. Dallas was an experiment for the league. At that time, the Stars would be one of the three southern-most teams in the league, along with the newly-created [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] and [[Florida Panthers]], as the league's first real ventures into southern non-traditional hockey markets. Though the Stars were relatively still unknown in the area, word of the team spread rapidly, and the immediate success of the team on the ice, as well as [[Mike Modano]]'s career best season (50 goals, 93 points) helped spur the team's popularity in Dallas. The Stars set franchise bests in wins (42) and points (97) in their first season in Texas, qualifying for the [[1994 Stanley Cup playoffs|1994 playoffs]]. The Stars further shocked the hockey world by sweeping the [[St. Louis Blues]] in the first round, but lost to the eventual Western Conference Champion [[Vancouver Canucks]] in the second round. The Stars' success in their first season, along with Modano's spectacular on ice performances, would be an integral part of the Stars' eventual franchise success in the immediate years to come.\n\nThe almost immediate success of the Stars was also helped by the long legacy of minor-league hockey in the area. Both incarnations of the [[Central Hockey League]] had two teams in the area, the [[Fort Worth Texans]] and the [[Dallas Blackhawks]] for years before the Stars' arrival. These two teams were bitter rivals, and some of the traditions and famous rivalry incidents, including what is thought to be the first known use anywhere at an athletic event of \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" by Fort Worth and the famous \"10 Cent Beer Night\" near riot in 1978 helped create awareness of hockey. Amateur and youth hockey was also extremely popular because of the long presence of the minor league teams.\n\nGreen, who had run into financial problems stemming from his business ventures outside of hockey, was forced to sell the team to businessman [[Tom Hicks]] in December 1995.<ref name=\"dmagazine1\"/>\n\n====Building for a championship====\nThe 1994\u201395 season was shortened by an [[1994\u201395 NHL lockout|owners' lockout]]. The Stars traded captain [[Mark Tinordi]] along with [[Rick Mrozik]] to the [[Washington Capitals]] before the season began for [[Kevin Hatcher]]. Longtime North Stars hold-over [[Neal Broten]] was named his replacement, although he was traded too after only 17 games to the [[New Jersey Devils]]. Broten was replaced by Kevin's younger brother [[Derian Hatcher]] as team captain, a role he would serve in for the next decade. The Stars played only 48 games that season posting a record of 17\u201323\u20138. Despite the shortened season and the losing record, the Stars again made the playoffs, losing in five games to the Red Wings in the first round.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DAL/ |title=Dallas Stars Franchise Index |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n[[File:Sergei Zubov.jpg|thumb|left|The Stars made several moves to revamp the roster in the 1996 off-season, notably making a trade to acquire [[Sergei Zubov]]. He remained on the team until he left the league in 2009.]] \nThe [[1995\u201396 NHL season|1995\u201396 season]] would be the first full season under new owner Tom Hicks. In the off-season, the Stars traded for former [[Montreal Canadiens]]' captain and three-time [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] winner [[Guy Carbonneau]], who was then with the St. Louis Blues. With the Stars struggling to begin the season, general manager and head coach [[Bob Gainey]] traded for center [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] from the [[Calgary Flames]] in exchange for [[Corey Millen]] and [[Jarome Iginla]], then a Stars prospect. The Stars recorded only 11 wins in the first half of the season, and Bob Gainey relinquished his coaching duties in January to be the full-time general manager of the team. The Stars soon hired [[Michigan K-Wings]] head coach [[Ken Hitchcock]] to replace him; it would be his first NHL head coaching position. The Stars then traded for [[Beno\u00eet Hogue|Benoit Hogue]] from the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] late in the season, but ultimately finished in sixth place in the Central Division, missing the playoffs for the first time since moving to Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DAL |title=Dallas Stars Franchise Index |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1996 off-season, the Stars continued to revamp their roster, adding defensemen [[Darryl Sydor]] from the [[Los Angeles Kings]] followed by [[Sergei Zubov]] from the Pittsburgh Penguins for Kevin Hatcher. Zubov would serve as the Stars' top defenseman and powerplay quarterback until leaving the league in 2009. On the ice, Ken Hitchcock's first season proved to be a good one. The Stars bested their 1994 totals, posting 48 wins and reaching the 100-point mark for the first time in franchise history. The Stars won the [[Central Division (NHL)|Central Division]], their first division title since 1983\u201384 (when they were still the Minnesota North Stars) and were seeded second in the [[1997 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1997.html |title=1996\u201397 NHL Season Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> Despite the regular season success, the youthful Stars were upset in the first round by the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in seven games. Defenseman [[Grant Ledyard]] tripped in overtime of Game 7, allowing [[Todd Marchant]] to score the game- and series-winning goal on a breakaway against goaltender [[Andy Moog]].\n\nIn the 1997 off-season, the Stars signed star goaltender [[Ed Belfour]] as a free agent after a well publicized falling-out with the San Jose Sharks, which had traded a number of players to the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] to obtain him in January in the previous season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeygoalies.org/bio/belfour.html |title=Ed Belfour |publisher=Hockeygoalies.org |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> Andy Moog was allowed to leave via free agency, but later returned to the Stars as an assistant coach. The [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1997\u201398 season]] was another banner year for the Stars. The Stars again set franchise records in wins (49) and points (109). Dallas acquired [[Mike Keane]] at the deadline from the [[New York Rangers]]. The Stars won the franchise's first [[Presidents' Trophy]] as the league's best regular season team, as well as the Central Division title for the second season in a row. Belfour set franchise season records for [[goals against average]] (1.88), wins (37) and just missed out on the [[Jennings Trophy]] by one goal to [[Martin Brodeur]] of the [[New Jersey Devils]]. The Stars were the first overall seed for the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs]] and defeated the eighth-seeded San Jose Sharks in six games in the first round. Notorious enforcer [[Bryan Marchment]] injured Joe Nieuwendyk's right knee, forcing him to miss the rest of the playoffs with torn ligaments. In the second round, they again met the Edmonton Oilers, this time defeating them in five games. However, without Nieuwendyk, the Stars lacked the firepower to overcome the defending [[Stanley Cup]] champion Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Finals and lost in six games. The Red Wings went on to win their second consecutive Stanley Cup.\n\n===Dominance, a Stanley Cup, and playoff disappointment (1998\u20132004)===\n{{See also|1999 Stanley Cup Finals}}\nIn the 1998 off-season, after falling just short in the Western Conference Finals, the Stars added what they believed was the final piece toward winning a championship: star goalscoring winger [[Brett Hull]]. Hull had already had a magnificent career with the St. Louis Blues, with three consecutive 70-goal seasons and a [[Hart Memorial Trophy]], but a fallout with Blues management led Hull to leave St. Louis via free agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stlouisblueslegends.blogspot.com/2007/01/brett-hull.html |title=St. Louis Blues Legends: Brett Hull |publisher=Stlouisblueslegends.blogspot.com |date=2011-01-09 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> Additionally, this was the first season for the Stars in the [[Pacific Division (NHL)|Pacific Division]] after the 1998 NHL division re-alignment.\n\nThe Stars 1998\u201399 season was excellent. The Stars won 51 games, surpassing the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history. They also recorded 114 points, which still stands today as a franchise record. They won the Pacific Division by 24 points, their third consecutive division title; a second consecutive Presidents' Trophy; the Jennings Trophy as the league's top defensive team; and were awarded the top seed in the [[1999 Stanley Cup playoffs|1999 playoffs]]. Winger [[Jere Lehtinen]] was also awarded the Frank J. Selke Trophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1999.html |title=1998\u201399 NHL Season Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n[[File:Joe Nieuwendyk Dallas.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Nieuwendyk]] helped the Stars win their first [[Stanley Cup]] in 1999. Nieuwendyk was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] for that year's playoffs.]]\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Dallas faced their playoff arch-rivals, the Edmonton Oilers. The Stars swept the Oilers in four tough games, winning Game 4 in the third overtime on a goal by Joe Nieuwendyk. They then faced the St. Louis Blues in the second round. After taking a 2\u20130 series lead, the Blues stormed back to tie the series. The Stars then won the next two games to beat the Blues in six games. The series again ended on an overtime goal, this time from Mike Modano. In the Conference Finals, they faced the [[Colorado Avalanche]] for the first time in Stars history. This would be the first of four playoff meetings between the Stars and Avalanche in the next seven years. After both the Stars and the Avalanche split the first four games at a 2\u20132 series tie, the Avalanche won Game 5 by a score of 7\u20135, taking a 3\u20132 series lead, The Stars rallied winning game six on the road, and Game 7 at home, both by 4\u20131 scorelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/NHL_1999.html |title=1999 NHL Playoffs Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\nThis was the Stars' first [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup Finals]] appearance as the Dallas Stars, although they made the finals twice as the Minnesota North Stars. They faced the Eastern Conference champion [[Buffalo Sabres]], who had defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4\u20131 in the Eastern Conference Finals. After splitting the first four games, the Stars vaunted defense would hold the Sabres to only one goal in the next two, winning Game 5 2\u20130 and Game 6 2\u20131 on an overtime goal by Brett Hull. Hull's goal at 14:51 of the third overtime was remembered as one of the most controversial goals ever scored. That season, the league still had the infamous \"crease rule\" in effect, which provided that if any player of the attacking team who did not have possession of the puck was in the crease before the puck, then any resulting goal was disallowed. Hull had initially gained possession of the puck outside the crease and had made a shot that was blocked by Buffalo goaltender [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek|Dominik Hasek]]. One of Hull's skates entered the crease as he corralled the rebound, and Hull's second shot scored the Cup-winning goal, followed by a lengthy official review. The goal was eventually allowed, as having simply blocked Hull's shot rather than catching it, Hasek never took possession of the puck away from Hull. Officials therefore determined that rather than calling it a loose puck, Hull would be considered to have had continuous possession of the puck from before his first shot outside the crease. The complexity of the crease rule, and the attendant difficulties in understanding its application by fans and players alike, combined with the controversy arising out of the disputed Stanley Cup-winning goal, resulted in the crease rule being repealed the following season. Hull's goal marked the 13th time a Stanley Cup-winning goal was scored in overtime, and only the fourth to be scored in multiple overtimes. This was the only time between [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|1995]] and [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|2003]] that a team other than the New Jersey Devils, Colorado Avalanche or Detroit Red Wings won the Stanley Cup.\n\nThe team added veterans [[Kirk Muller]], [[Dave Manson]] and [[Sylvain C\u00f4t\u00e9|Sylvain Cote]] in an effort to defend their Stanley Cup championship in {{NHL Year|1999}}. On December 31, 1999, Brett Hull scored his 600 and 601st career goals in a 5\u20134 win over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The Stars ultimately won the Pacific Division for the second year in a row, and were seeded second in the Western Conference. Dallas then defeated the Edmonton Oilers and San Jose Sharks in the first and second rounds, both 4\u20131 series victories. The Stars, for the second season in a row, defeated the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference Finals in seven games to reach their second consecutive Stanley Cup Finals, where they met the New Jersey Devils. Because the Devils finished the regular season with one more point than Dallas, the Stars had to play their first playoff series without home ice advantage since 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2000.html |title=1999-00 NHL Season Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> The Stars lost all three games at the Reunion Arena in the Finals, and lost the series in Game 6 on a double-overtime goal by New Jersey forward [[Jason Arnott]].\n\n====Unsuccessful playoff runs====\nHoping to win back the Stanley Cup, the Stars again captured the Pacific Division, posting a solid 48\u201324\u20138\u20132 record in the [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301 season]]. In the playoffs, the Stars met the Edmonton Oilers in the first round, battling back-and-forth through the first four games, with each game decided by one goal, including three going into overtime. Game 5 would also go to overtime, as the Stars took a 3\u20132 series lead on a goal by Kirk Muller. However, in Game 6 in [[Edmonton]], the Stars did not need overtime, advancing to the second round with a 3\u20131 win. Facing the St. Louis Blues, the Stars would run out of gas, being swept in four straight games. The Game 2 loss would be the last NHL game played in Reunion Arena.\n[[File:MartyTurco.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marty Turco]] was awarded the starting goaltender position in the 2001\u201302 season, with the departure of [[Ed Belfour]] to free agency.]]\nMoving into the brand new [[American Airlines Center]] for the [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2001\u201302 season]], the Stars got off to a slow start to the season, as goaltender Ed Belfour struggled through one of his worst seasons. Head coach Ken Hitchcock was eventually fired, being replaced by [[Rick Wilson (ice hockey)|Rick Wilson]]. Despite the coaching change, the Stars continued to play poor hockey. With the prospect of missing the playoffs, the Stars traded 1999 Conn Smythe winner Joe Nieuwendyk and [[Jamie Langenbrunner]] to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for [[Randy McKay]] and Jason Arnott, who scored the game-winning goal in the 2000 Finals against Dallas. The Stars would eventually go on to post a respectable record of 35\u201328\u201313\u20135. However, it would not be enough for the playoffs, as they fell four points short of the final eighth spot in the Western Conference. Following the season, coach Rick Wilson would return to assistant coaching duties, as the Stars brought in [[Dave Tippett]] as his replacement.\n\nAs in the 2002 off-season, Ed Belfour left via free agency to the Toronto Maple Leafs. To begin the [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303 season]], the Stars awarded the starting goaltending position to [[Marty Turco]], who went on to have one of the best seasons in NHL history, posting the lowest goals against average (GAA) since 1940, at 1.76. However, missing 18 games late in the season likely cost him a shot at the [[Vezina Trophy]], awarded to the leagues's top regular season goaltender. Regardless, the Stars posted the best record in the Western Conference at 46\u201317\u201315\u20134, and along the way, two-way star Jere Lehtinen won his third Frank J. Selke Trophy. In the [[2003 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]], the Stars once again met the Edmonton Oilers, and once again the Oilers would prove a contentious opponent, winning two of the first three games. However, the Stars would prove the better team again by winning the next three games to take the series in six games. The Stars' second round series against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim got off to an unbelievable start, as the game went deep into overtime tied 3\u20133. However, Mighty Ducks goaltender [[Jean-S\u00e9bastien Gigu\u00e8re|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]] stopped 60 shots as the Ducks scored early in the fifth overtime. Game 2 would be more of the same, as the Ducks stunned the Stars in overtime. Desperately needing a win, the Stars bounced back to take Game 3 in Anaheim. However, the Ducks would take a 3\u20131 series lead by breaking a scoreless tie late in the third period of Game 4. In Game 5, the Stars finally solved Giguere by scoring four goals to keep their playoff hopes alive. However, the Stars dreams of a return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals would end in heartbreaking fashionm as the Ducks broke a 3\u20133 tie with 1:06 left in Game 6 on a goal by defenseman [[Sandis Ozoli\u0146\u0161|Sandis Ozolinsh]].\n\nComing off their disappointing playoff loss, the Stars would get off to a shaky start to the [[2003\u201304 NHL Season|2003\u201304 season]], as they played mediocre hockey through the first three months of the season, posting a sub-.500 record. However, as the calendar turned to 2004, the Stars began to find their game, as they posted a 9\u20134\u20133 record in January. As the season wore on, the Stars would get stronger, climbing up the playoff ladder and eventually reaching second place in the Pacific Division, where they finished with a solid 41\u201326\u201313\u20132 record; Marty Turco had another outstanding season, recording a 1.98 GAA. However, the Stars could not carry their momentum into the playoffs, as they were beaten by the Colorado Avalanche in five games in the first round.\n\n===Post-lockout era (2005\u20132008)===\nComing out of the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout|owners' lockout]] that cancelled the entire [[2004\u201305 NHL season|2004\u201305 season]], the Stars remained one of the strongest teams in the Western Conference for the start of [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306]], as they won four of their first five games on the way to a solid October. November would be even better for Dallas, as they won 10 of 13 games and took over first place in the Pacific Division, a position they would hold most of the season, as they went on to finish with a terrific record of 53\u201323\u20136. One reason for the Stars success was their strong play in shootouts, as forward [[Jussi Jokinen]] was nearly automatic, making 10-of-13 shot attempts. Also performing strong in shootouts was Sergei Zubov, who used a slow-but-steady backhand to go 7-for-12, as the Stars ultimately won 12 of 13 games that were settled by a shootout. As the number two seed in the Western Conference, the Stars faced the seventh-seeded Colorado Avalanche. The Stars were favorited to win the Western Conference, and some even predicted them to win the Stanley Cup. However, the Stars would stumble right from the start, losing Game 1 by a score of 5\u20132 as the Avalanche scored five unanswered goals after the Stars jumped out to a promising 2\u20130 lead. Game 2 would see the Stars suffer another setback at home, as the Stars lost in overtime 5\u20134 on a goal by [[Joe Sakic]]. On the road in Game 3, the Stars led 3\u20132 in the final minute before the Avalanche forced overtime on a goal by [[Andrew Brunette]], while [[Alex Tanguay]] won the game just 69 seconds into overtime to put the Stars in a 3\u20130 hole. The Stars would avoid the sweep with 4\u20131 win in Game 4, but overtime would doom them again in Game 5, as Andrew Brunette scored the series winner at 6:05, ending the Stars' playoffs hopes after just five games.\n\n====Dallas hosts the All-Star Game (2006\u20132007 season)====\nFollowing the previous season's disappointing first round playoff upset at the hands of the seventh-seeded Avalanche, the Stars made a number of changes during the 2006 off-season. Former Stars goalkeeper Andy Moog was promoted to assistant general manager for player development (he kept his job as goaltending coach) and former player [[Ulf Dahl\u00e9n|Ulf Dahlen]] was hired as an assistant coach. The Stars allowed center Jason Arnott, defenseman [[Willie Mitchell (ice hockey)|Willie Mitchell]] and goaltender [[Johan Hedberg]] to leave as [[free agents]]. Forward [[Niko Kapanen]] was traded to the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] and the remaining two years on fan-favorite [[winger (ice hockey)|right winger]] [[Bill Guerin]]'s contract were bought out. The Stars also received [[Patrik \u0160tefan|Patrik Stefan]] and [[Jaroslav Modr\u00fd|Jaroslav Modry]] in the Atlanta trade, and signed [[Eric Lindros]], [[Jeff Halpern]], [[Matthew Barnaby]] and [[Darryl Sydor]] as free agents. Young goaltender [[Mike Smith (ice hockey, born 1982)|Mike Smith]] was promoted to the NHL to serve as Marty Turco's backup. During the season, key future pieces \u2013 center [[Mike Ribeiro]] and defenseman [[Mattias Norstr\u00f6m|Mattias Norstrom]] \u2013 were added through separate trades. Young players [[Joel Lundqvist]], [[Krys Barch]], [[Nicklas Grossmann]] and [[Chris Conner]] all saw significant ice time while other players were out of the lineup with injuries.\n[[File:Modano Record Goal.jpg|thumb|[[Mike Modano]] scoring his 500th goal on November 7, 2007 against the [[San Jose Sharks]].

Defenseman [[Philippe Boucher]] and goaltender Marty Turco would represent the Stars as part of the Western Conference All-Star roster. The Stars qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Western Conference and squared off against the Vancouver Canucks in the first round. Marty Turco delivered three shutout wins in Games 2, 5 and 6, but the Stars' offense failed to capitalize and they lost the series in seven games, the third season in a row that they lost in the first round.\n\n====Return to playoff prominence (2007\u20132008 season)====\nIn the [[2007 NHL Entry Draft]], the Stars drafted the relatively unknown [[Jamie Benn]] 129th overall.

Off-season free agent acquisition [[Sean Avery]] caused a media uproar over comments he made to a Canadian reporter about ex-girlfriend [[Elisha Cuthbert]] and her relationship with [[Calgary Flames]]' defenseman [[Dion Phaneuf]] before a game in [[Calgary]]. The incident forced the team to suspend Avery for the season; he was later waived by the Stars. That incident, plus injuries to key players Brad Richards and Sergei Zubov, caused the Stars to tailspin to a 12th-place finish and the first missed playoffs for Dallas since 2002.\n\nIn the wake of the season, the Stars hired a new general manager, former player and alternate captain Joe Nieuwendyk. Hull and Jackson remained with the Stars, but were reassigned to new roles within the organization. Less than a week after he was hired, Nieuwendyk fired six-season head coach Dave Tippett on June 10, 2009, and hired [[Marc Crawford]] the next day as his replacement. Other off-season moves included the addition of [[Charlie Huddy]] as assistant coach in charge of defense and the promotions of [[Stu Barnes]] and Andy Moog to assistant coaches.\n\nThe Stars' [[2009\u201310 NHL season|2009\u201310 season]] was similar to the previous one. Inconsistent play and defensive struggles plagued the team throughout the season, as they failed to adjust to Marc Crawford's new offensively-minded system, and owner Tom Hicks' financial troubles prevented the team from spending more than $45&nbsp;million on payroll, over $11&nbsp;million beneath the league salary cap.<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/hockey/stars/stories/020910dnspostarshicks.327a05b.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212111804/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/hockey/stars/stories/020910dnspostarshicks.327a05b.html |date=February 12, 2010 }}</ref> The Stars failed to win more than three games in a row all season, finished in last in the Pacific Division and repeated their 12th place conference finish from the year before with a record of 37\u201331\u201314 for 88 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/standings |title=2011\u201312 NHL Preseason Conference Standings \u2013 National Hockey League|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> This was the first time that they would miss the playoffs two seasons in a row since the Stars moved to Texas.

Modano subsequently signed with the Detroit Red Wings while Turco joined the Chicago Blackhawks. Winger Jere Lehtinen, who played his entire career with the Stars, announced his retirement in December 2010. The team also made key acquisitions, such as winger [[Adam Burish]] (who was on the 2010 Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks) and goaltender [[Andrew Raycroft]]. They also gave [[Jonathan Cheechoo]] a try-out, but he was cut and later signed with division rivals San Jose Sharks.\n\nTo begin the [[2010\u201311 NHL season|2010\u201311 season]], the Stars won their first three games, going on a three-game win streak for the first time since the 2007\u201308 season by beating the New Jersey Devils in overtime, [[New York Islanders]] in a shootout and against Mike Modano and the Red Wings. During the third game against the Red Wings, the Stars crowd gave Modano a standing ovation as he was shown on the [[Jumbotron]].\n\nAfter a hot start to the season, the Stars dominated the first half of the season, staying on the Pacific Division lead and staying in the top three spots of the conference. It seemed like the old Stars were back, as through the first half of the season, they went 30\u201315\u20136. But after the All-Star Game, the Stars went into a slump, going on numerous losing streaks and blowing games. Through this though, the Stars still remained in the playoff picture. On the day of the trade deadline, the Stars traded [[James Neal (ice hockey)|James Neal]] and [[Matt Niskanen]] to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for defenseman [[Alex Goligoski]]. After an awful second half, the Stars still had a chance to make the playoffs by winning all their games in April. They won all of them except for last, as they lost to the Minnesota Wild 5\u20133, costing them a playoff spot.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs for the third consecutive season, Dallas fired coach Marc Crawford on April 12, 2011.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nhl/news/story?id=6338807 Stars fire Marc Crawford].

To begin the [[2011\u201312 NHL season|2011\u201312 season]], the Stars once again jumped out to a fast start, going 22\u201315\u20131 through the first 38 games of the season. However, when the second half of the season began, the Stars slumped through the months of January and February, before getting hot again in late February. Throughout March, the Stars regained the lead of the Pacific Division. Beginning on March 26, 2012, the Stars embarked on a western road trip that saw them visit the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks. Going into the road trip, the Stars were in control of their own destiny, having to gain four points on the road trip to win their first Pacific Division title since the 2005\u201306 season. After the Stars lost 5\u20134 in Calgary to the Flames, the Stars beat the Oilers two nights later, 3\u20131. This would be their last win of the season, as the Stars were rolled over by the Canucks and Sharks. Even though they had lost the division crown, the Stars still had a chance to clinch a playoff spot. However, the Stars were eliminated from playoff contention on April 5 in a 2\u20130 loss to the playoff-bound [[Nashville Predators]]. The team failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year, setting a franchise record for futility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/stte/dallas-stars-5404.html |title=Dallas Stars Statistics and History |publisher=Internet Hockey Database |accessdate=2012-11-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108144503/http://www.hockeydb.com/stte/dallas-stars-5404.html |archivedate=2012-11-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/stte/minnesota-north-stars-6876.html|title=Minnesota North Stars Statistics and History|publisher=Internet Hockey Database|accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref>\n[[File:Tyler Seguin - Dallas Stars.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tyler Seguin]] with the Stars in the [[2013\u201314 NHL season|2013\u201314]] season.

In mid-season, forward [[Michael Ryder]] was traded to his former team, the Montreal Canadiens, for [[Erik Cole]]. This shocked many Stars fans, as Ryder was a fan-favorite to Stars fans and had been producing good stats for the Stars throughout the shortened season. Before the trade deadline in early April, the Stars began to falter, and the team's captain, Brenden Morrow, was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins; Roy was traded to the Vancouver Canucks; Jagr to the [[Boston Bruins]]; and [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Vincour|Tomas Vincour]] to the Colorado Avalanche to close out the [[NHL trade deadline]], all in exchange for draft picks and prospects.<ref>[http://stars.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=663658 '&#39;Daryl Reaugh'&#39;.

However, the Stars' remaining young players pulled together to win six of their next eight games, thus propelling the Stars back into the 2013 playoff race. The Stars soon became the new Cinderella team and were getting better as their new-found success went on. However, the Stars dropped their final five games, losing all of them and gaining only one point in their final five games, which eliminated them from playoff contention. The Stars had now missed the playoffs for five-straight seasons, continuing to set the all-time record in the franchise (dating back to the Minnesota days) for most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance.\n\n===Doug Dimmadome era (2020-Present)===\n\nOn April 1, 2020 Tom Gaglardi sold the Dallas Stars to Doug Dimmadome Owner Of The Dimmsdale Dimmadome, and immediately changed the name of the American Airlines Center to The Dimmadome.\n\nThe day after their final regular season game of the 2012\u201313 season (a 3\u20130 loss to the Detroit Red Wings), the Stars fired general manager Joe Nieuwendyk.

Under new head coach [[Lindy Ruff]], the Stars made it to the [[2014 Stanley Cup playoffs|2014 playoffs]] with a successful run on a 40\u201331\u201311 record, finishing fourth in the new-look [[Central Division (NHL)|Central Division]] for the [[2013\u201314 Dallas Stars season|2013\u201314 season]].

He also signed Senators player [[Ale\u0161 Hemsk\u00fd|Ales Hemsky]] as a free agent on a three-year, $12&nbsp;million contract on July 1, 2014. Despite these moves, the Stars finished with the second-lowest goaltender save percentage in the league during the [[2014\u201315 NHL season|2014\u201315 season]], which resulted in them failing to qualify for the [[2015 Stanley Cup playoffs|2015 playoffs]] due to their sixth-place finish in the Central Division. The lone bright spot of the 2014\u201315 season was Jamie Benn winning the [[Art Ross Trophy]]. On April 11, 2015, Benn scored four points in the Stars' last regular season game to finish with 87 points on the season and win the Art Ross Trophy. His final point, a secondary assist with 8.5 seconds left in the game, allowed him to overtake [[John Tavares]] for the award.<ref>http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/jamie-benn-records-assist-with-9-seconds-to-play-to-win-art-ross-trophy/</ref>\n\nIn the [[2015\u201316 NHL season|2015\u201316 season]], the Stars won their first Central Division title since 1998 and posted the best regular season record in the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they defeated the Minnesota Wild in six games. In the second round, they faced the St. Louis Blues, for the first time since 2001, and lost the series in seven games. The Stars finished with a 34\u201337\u201311 record in an injury-plagued [[2016\u201317 NHL season|2016\u201317 season]], missing the playoffs for the seventh time in the past nine seasons. As a result, the team announced that head coach Lindy Ruff's contract would not be renewed. Ken Hitchcock returned as head coach for the [[2017\u201318 NHL season|following season]], and once again, the Stars missed the playoffs. Hitchcock retired after the season and was succeeded at the head coaching spot by [[Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)|Jim Montgomery]]. Montgomery's first season as the Stars coach saw the team make the playoffs, defeating the Nashville Predators in the first round, but falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues in double-overtime of Game 7 of the second round.\n\n==Team information==\n===Arena===\n[[File:American Airlines Center Dallas.JPG|thumb|The [[American Airlines Center]] is the second, and current home arena used by the Dallas Stars.]]\nWhen the Stars first moved from Minnesota, they played in [[Reunion Arena]], which they shared with the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Dallas Mavericks]]. For hockey, Reunion Arena held 17,001 for NHL games. Throughout the hockey history of Reunion Arena, the arena was known for having one of the worst ice surfaces in the league, especially in its final days hosting the Stars. The Stars played at Reunion for eight years, from [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993]]\u2013[[2000\u201301 NHL season|2001]]. Before the [[2001\u201302 NHL season]], both the Stars and the Mavericks moved into the new [[American Airlines Center]], which is in the [[Victory Park, Dallas, Texas|Victory Park]] neighborhood of Dallas, just north of Reunion Arena. The American Airlines Center holds 18,584 for Stars and NHL games. On January 24, 2007, the AAC hosted the [[2007 National Hockey League All-Star Game]]. The AAC and the Dallas Stars have won several local and NHL awards for \"Best Fan Experience\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-stars/stars/2017/08/17/stars-earn-highest-grade-fan-experience-among-local-sports-teams|title=Stars earn highest grade for 'Fan Experience'}}</ref> After Purchasing the Stars, Doug Dimmadome changed the name of the Arena to The Dimmadome.\n\n===Broadcast===\nAll Dallas Stars games are broadcast on radio on [[KTCK (AM)|KTCK]] under a five-year deal announced in January 2009.<ref>[http://stars.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=404535 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118013701/http://stars.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=404535 |date=January 18, 2009 }}</ref> KTCK replaced [[WBAP (AM)|WBAP]], which had broadcast games since the beginning of the 1994 season after [[KLIF (AM)|KLIF]] has broadcast the first season in Dallas in 1993. Television coverage occurs primarily on [[Fox Sports Southwest]] (FSN), with [[KTXA]] (Channel 21) or FSSW+ broadcasting games when FSSW has a conflict.\n\nThe Stars, along with the Buffalo Sabres and [[Carolina Hurricanes]] are one of only three NHL teams to [[simulcast]] the entirety of their games on TV and radio, which the team has done since their 1993 arrival in Dallas. The original broadcast team from 1993 to 1996 was Mike Fornes (play-by-play) and [[Ralph Strangis]] (color). Fornes left the broadcast team after the 1995\u201396 season; Strangis moved to the play-by-play role and color commentator [[Daryl Reaugh|Daryl \"Razor\" Reaugh]] was added. Although both the DFW-area's large media market and the team's fan base could theoretically support separate television and radio broadcast teams, the Stars have continued simulcasting due to the popularity of \"Ralph and Razor\" (as they are known) among local listeners and viewers. Like other NHL teams, the Stars now have a live radio broadcast transmitted inside American Airlines Center on 97.5 FM. This is done because AM radio signals often cannot penetrate concrete and steel building exteriors.\n\nStrangis retired from the booth after the 2014\u201315 season and was replaced by [[Dave Strader]]. In June 2016, Strader was diagnosed with [[cholangiocarcinoma]], a fairly rare and aggressive form of cancer of the [[bile duct]]. To begin the 2016\u201317 season, Reaugh assumed play-by-play duties while Strader underwent treatment. Studio analyst and former Stars defenseman, [[Craig Ludwig]], took over as color commentator. During a break in Strader's treatment, he returned to the broadcast booth on February 18, 2017, a 4\u20133 overtime home win against the Tampa Bay Lightning. After the game, the Stars saluted Strader at center ice. On October 1, 2017, Strader died of cancer at age 62, leaving Reaugh and Ludwig to call the 2017\u201318 season. In July 2018, the Stars announced that Reaugh would return to color commentary for the 2018\u201319 season, with former studio host Josh Bogorad taking over the play-by-play.<ref>[https://www.nhl.com/stars/news/dallas-stars-announce-broadcast-team-for-2018-19-season/c-299620262 Stars announce broadcast team for 2018-19 season]</ref>\n\n===Logo and jersey design===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dallas Stars logo.svg|thumb|150px|Former logo used from 1993 to 2013.

Away uniforms were black and home uniforms were white. With minor trim changes, a darker shade of green, and the word 'Dallas' added in the 1994\u201395 season, they kept this design until their [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|1999 Stanley Cup]]-winning campaign. The black pants have the word \"Dallas\" in gold run through the sides with green stripes.\n\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, the Stars introduced an alternate uniform that partly resembled those worn during the [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]] at the time. The uniform was mostly green on top and black at the bottom, in a star-shaped design. For the 1999\u20132000 season, it became the primary away uniform, and was paired with a new home uniform featuring the same basic design, with white on top and green at the bottom. They kept this design until the 2006\u201307 season, during which the league switched color designations on home and away jerseys in the 2003\u201304 season. The striping was also eliminated on the black pants.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dallas Stars Shoulder Patch.svg|thumb|150px|left|Shoulder patch and alternate logo used by the Stars from 1999 to 2013.]] -->\nThe Stars introduced an alternate jersey for the 2003\u201304 season that proved both embarrassing and unpopular to critics and fans. The uniform, which was black with a green bottom and red trim, featured a modern representation of the [[constellation]] [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] topped by a trailing green star with red trail marks. However, fans and critics derided the uniform crest for its resemblance to a [[uterus]], nicknaming it the \"Mooterus\". The uniform was used until the 2005\u201306 season.\n\nWith the switch to the [[Reebok]] Edge uniform system, the jerseys underwent a complete redesign. The home black jersey, introduced for the 2007\u201308 season, features the player's number on the chest and an arched 'Dallas' in white with gold trim, with the primary logo on the shoulders. The primary away jerseys, which were used from 2007\u201310 and was used as an alternate for its final season, had the Stars logo crest in front and the uniform number on the top right, with the Texas alternate logo on the shoulders. An alternate white jersey based on the home black jersey was introduced for the 2008\u201309 season; they became the regular away uniforms for the 2010\u201311 season. The lettering is in green with gold and black trim. Both uniforms were used until the 2012\u201313 season.\n\nA new logo and uniforms were introduced for the 2013\u201314 season. Silver replaced gold as the tertiary color, while green (in a bright new shade called \"Victory Green\", similar to the old North Stars' shade of green) was reintroduced as a primary uniform color. The new logo features the letter D centering a star, symbolizing Dallas' nickname as \"The Big D\". The home uniforms are in green with black and white striping, while the away uniforms are in white with a green shoulder yoke, and black and green striping. The inner collar features the team name on the home uniforms, and the city name on the away uniforms. The secondary logo, with the primary inside a roundel with the team name, is featured in the shoulders.\n\nThe Stars unveiled a special edition uniform for the [[2020 NHL Winter Classic]], featuring a design inspired from the defunct [[United States Hockey League|USHL]] [[Dallas Texans (USHL)|Dallas Texans]] hockey club. The uniform features the word \"Stars\" (with the star substituting for the letter A) in the middle of the big letter \"D\". Both are in white with silver trim. A silhouette of the state of Texas in silver and green trim with the letter \"D\" inside adorns the left sleeve.\n\n===Minor league affiliates===\n[[File:Texas Stars logo.svg|150px|thumb|The [[Texas Stars]], based in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]], are the Stars current [[American Hockey League]] affiliate.]]\nThe Dallas Stars are presently affiliated with two [[minor league]] teams.

The [[Texas Stars]] began play in the AHL in the 2009\u201310 season as an affiliate for Dallas. They are located in [[Cedar Park, Texas]] (northwest of [[Austin]]).\n\nIn addition to their AHL affiliate, the Dallas Stars are also affiliated with the [[Idaho Steelheads]] of the [[ECHL]].

With both teams on the verge of folding, the league permitted the two failing franchises to merge. The merged team continued as the Minnesota North Stars, while the Seals/Barons franchise records were retired. However, the Gunds were the merged team's principal owners, and the North Stars assumed the Barons' place in the [[Adams Division]] in order to balance out the divisions. The merger brought with it a number of talented players, and the North Stars were revived\u2014they reached the [[Stanley Cup]] Finals in [[1980\u201381 NHL season|1981]], where they lost in five games to the [[New York Islanders]]. However, by the early 1990s, declining attendance and the inability to secure a new downtown revenue-generating arena led ownership to request permission to move the team to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 1990. The league rejected the request and instead agreed to award an [[expansion team|expansion franchise]], the [[San Jose Sharks]], to the Gund brothers. The North Stars were sold to a group of investors that were originally looking to place a team in San Jose, although one of the group's members, former [[Calgary Flames]] part-owner [[Norman Green]], would eventually gain control of the team.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cameron|first=Steve|title=Feeding Frenzy! The Wild New World of the San Jose Sharks|pages=29\u201338|year=1994|publisher=Taylor Publishing Co.}}</ref> In the following season, the North Stars made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, only to lose to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].\n\nAfter the 1990\u201391 season, the North Stars suffered through poor attendance and declining profits. The team's fortunes were further impeded by the terms of the settlement with the Gund brothers, in which they were permitted to take a number of North Stars players to San Jose. Green explored the possibility of moving the team to [[Anaheim]], however the league decided instead to place the expansion [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks]] there in 1993\u201394. In their final two seasons in Minnesota, the team adopted a new logo which omitted the \"North\" from \"North Stars\", leading many fans to anticipate the team heading south.<ref name=\"dmagazine1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dmagazine.com/Home/D_Magazine/2010/January/The_35_Biggest_Moments_in_Modern_Dallas_History_11.aspx |title=The 35 Biggest Moments in Modern Dallas History |publisher=Dmagazine.com |accessdate=2011-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520003803/http://www.dmagazine.com/Home/D_Magazine/2010/January/The_35_Biggest_Moments_in_Modern_Dallas_History_11.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Relocation and early years in Dallas (1993\u20131998)===\n[[File:Reunion Arena.jpg|thumb|[[Reunion Arena]] was the first home for the Stars in Dallas. The arena was the Stars\u2019 home from 1993 to 2001.]]\nIn 1993, amid further attendance woes and bitter personal controversy, Green obtained permission from the league to move the team to Dallas, for the [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993\u201394 season]], with the decision announced on March 10, 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/patrick-plus-thanks-norm-green/265064341/|title=Patrick Plus: Thanks, Norm Green|website=Star Tribune|access-date=2016-04-14}}</ref> Green was convinced by former [[Dallas Cowboys]] quarterback [[Roger Staubach]] that Dallas would be a suitable market for an NHL team.<ref name=\"dmagazine1\"/> He decided to retain the \"Stars\" nickname, as it matched Texas' official nickname as \"The Lone Star State.\" The Stars would move into [[Reunion Arena]], built in 1980, the downtown arena already occupied by the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Dallas Mavericks]].\n\nTo quell the ensuing controversy, the NHL promised that the Twin Cities would receive an expansion franchise in the future; that promise was fulfilled in 2000 in the form of the [[Minnesota Wild]].\n\nWith the league changing the names of the conferences and divisions that season, the newly relocated Stars were placed in the Central Division of the Western Conference, and played their first game in Dallas on October 5, 1993, a 6\u20134 win against the [[Detroit Red Wings]].<ref>[https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DAL/1994_games.html 1993-94 Dallas Stars Schedule and Results]. hockey-reference.com</ref> In that game, [[Neal Broten]] scored the first Stars goal in Dallas. Dallas was an experiment for the league. At that time, the Stars would be one of the three southern-most teams in the league, along with the newly-created [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] and [[Florida Panthers]], as the league's first real ventures into southern non-traditional hockey markets. Though the Stars were relatively still unknown in the area, word of the team spread rapidly, and the immediate success of the team on the ice, as well as [[Mike Modano]]'s career best season (50 goals, 93 points) helped spur the team's popularity in Dallas. The Stars set franchise bests in wins (42) and points (97) in their first season in Texas, qualifying for the [[1994 Stanley Cup playoffs|1994 playoffs]]. The Stars further shocked the hockey world by sweeping the [[St. Louis Blues]] in the first round, but lost to the eventual Western Conference Champion [[Vancouver Canucks]] in the second round. The Stars' success in their first season, along with Modano's spectacular on ice performances, would be an integral part of the Stars' eventual franchise success in the immediate years to come.\n\nThe almost immediate success of the Stars was also helped by the long legacy of minor-league hockey in the area. Both incarnations of the [[Central Hockey League]] had two teams in the area, the [[Fort Worth Texans]] and the [[Dallas Blackhawks]] for years before the Stars' arrival. These two teams were bitter rivals, and some of the traditions and famous rivalry incidents, including what is thought to be the first known use anywhere at an athletic event of \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" by Fort Worth and the famous \"10 Cent Beer Night\" near riot in 1978 helped create awareness of hockey. Amateur and youth hockey was also extremely popular because of the long presence of the minor league teams.\n\nGreen, who had run into financial problems stemming from his business ventures outside of hockey, was forced to sell the team to businessman [[Tom Hicks]] in December 1995.<ref name=\"dmagazine1\"/>\n\n====Building for a championship====\nThe 1994\u201395 season was shortened by an [[1994\u201395 NHL lockout|owners' lockout]]. The Stars traded captain [[Mark Tinordi]] along with [[Rick Mrozik]] to the [[Washington Capitals]] before the season began for [[Kevin Hatcher]]. Longtime North Stars hold-over [[Neal Broten]] was named his replacement, although he was traded too after only 17 games to the [[New Jersey Devils]]. Broten was replaced by Kevin's younger brother [[Derian Hatcher]] as team captain, a role he would serve in for the next decade. The Stars played only 48 games that season posting a record of 17\u201323\u20138. Despite the shortened season and the losing record, the Stars again made the playoffs, losing in five games to the Red Wings in the first round.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DAL/ |title=Dallas Stars Franchise Index |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n[[File:Sergei Zubov.jpg|thumb|left|The Stars made several moves to revamp the roster in the 1996 off-season, notably making a trade to acquire [[Sergei Zubov]]. He remained on the team until he left the league in 2009.]] \nThe [[1995\u201396 NHL season|1995\u201396 season]] would be the first full season under new owner Tom Hicks. In the off-season, the Stars traded for former [[Montreal Canadiens]]' captain and three-time [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] winner [[Guy Carbonneau]], who was then with the St. Louis Blues. With the Stars struggling to begin the season, general manager and head coach [[Bob Gainey]] traded for center [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] from the [[Calgary Flames]] in exchange for [[Corey Millen]] and [[Jarome Iginla]], then a Stars prospect. The Stars recorded only 11 wins in the first half of the season, and Bob Gainey relinquished his coaching duties in January to be the full-time general manager of the team. The Stars soon hired [[Michigan K-Wings]] head coach [[Ken Hitchcock]] to replace him; it would be his first NHL head coaching position. The Stars then traded for [[Beno\u00eet Hogue|Benoit Hogue]] from the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] late in the season, but ultimately finished in sixth place in the Central Division, missing the playoffs for the first time since moving to Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DAL |title=Dallas Stars Franchise Index |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1996 off-season, the Stars continued to revamp their roster, adding defensemen [[Darryl Sydor]] from the [[Los Angeles Kings]] followed by [[Sergei Zubov]] from the Pittsburgh Penguins for Kevin Hatcher. Zubov would serve as the Stars' top defenseman and powerplay quarterback until leaving the league in 2009. On the ice, Ken Hitchcock's first season proved to be a good one. The Stars bested their 1994 totals, posting 48 wins and reaching the 100-point mark for the first time in franchise history. The Stars won the [[Central Division (NHL)|Central Division]], their first division title since 1983\u201384 (when they were still the Minnesota North Stars) and were seeded second in the [[1997 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1997.html |title=1996\u201397 NHL Season Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> Despite the regular season success, the youthful Stars were upset in the first round by the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in seven games. Defenseman [[Grant Ledyard]] tripped in overtime of Game 7, allowing [[Todd Marchant]] to score the game- and series-winning goal on a breakaway against goaltender [[Andy Moog]].\n\nIn the 1997 off-season, the Stars signed star goaltender [[Ed Belfour]] as a free agent after a well publicized falling-out with the San Jose Sharks, which had traded a number of players to the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] to obtain him in January in the previous season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeygoalies.org/bio/belfour.html |title=Ed Belfour |publisher=Hockeygoalies.org |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> Andy Moog was allowed to leave via free agency, but later returned to the Stars as an assistant coach. The [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1997\u201398 season]] was another banner year for the Stars. The Stars again set franchise records in wins (49) and points (109). Dallas acquired [[Mike Keane]] at the deadline from the [[New York Rangers]]. The Stars won the franchise's first [[Presidents' Trophy]] as the league's best regular season team, as well as the Central Division title for the second season in a row. Belfour set franchise season records for [[goals against average]] (1.88), wins (37) and just missed out on the [[Jennings Trophy]] by one goal to [[Martin Brodeur]] of the [[New Jersey Devils]]. The Stars were the first overall seed for the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs]] and defeated the eighth-seeded San Jose Sharks in six games in the first round. Notorious enforcer [[Bryan Marchment]] injured Joe Nieuwendyk's right knee, forcing him to miss the rest of the playoffs with torn ligaments. In the second round, they again met the Edmonton Oilers, this time defeating them in five games. However, without Nieuwendyk, the Stars lacked the firepower to overcome the defending [[Stanley Cup]] champion Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Finals and lost in six games. The Red Wings went on to win their second consecutive Stanley Cup.\n\n===Dominance, a Stanley Cup, and playoff disappointment (1998\u20132004)===\n{{See also|1999 Stanley Cup Finals}}\nIn the 1998 off-season, after falling just short in the Western Conference Finals, the Stars added what they believed was the final piece toward winning a championship: star goalscoring winger [[Brett Hull]]. Hull had already had a magnificent career with the St. Louis Blues, with three consecutive 70-goal seasons and a [[Hart Memorial Trophy]], but a fallout with Blues management led Hull to leave St. Louis via free agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stlouisblueslegends.blogspot.com/2007/01/brett-hull.html |title=St. Louis Blues Legends: Brett Hull |publisher=Stlouisblueslegends.blogspot.com |date=2011-01-09 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> Additionally, this was the first season for the Stars in the [[Pacific Division (NHL)|Pacific Division]] after the 1998 NHL division re-alignment.\n\nThe Stars 1998\u201399 season was excellent. The Stars won 51 games, surpassing the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history. They also recorded 114 points, which still stands today as a franchise record. They won the Pacific Division by 24 points, their third consecutive division title; a second consecutive Presidents' Trophy; the Jennings Trophy as the league's top defensive team; and were awarded the top seed in the [[1999 Stanley Cup playoffs|1999 playoffs]]. Winger [[Jere Lehtinen]] was also awarded the Frank J. Selke Trophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1999.html |title=1998\u201399 NHL Season Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n[[File:Joe Nieuwendyk Dallas.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Nieuwendyk]] helped the Stars win their first [[Stanley Cup]] in 1999. Nieuwendyk was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] for that year's playoffs.]]\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Dallas faced their playoff arch-rivals, the Edmonton Oilers. The Stars swept the Oilers in four tough games, winning Game 4 in the third overtime on a goal by Joe Nieuwendyk. They then faced the St. Louis Blues in the second round. After taking a 2\u20130 series lead, the Blues stormed back to tie the series. The Stars then won the next two games to beat the Blues in six games. The series again ended on an overtime goal, this time from Mike Modano. In the Conference Finals, they faced the [[Colorado Avalanche]] for the first time in Stars history. This would be the first of four playoff meetings between the Stars and Avalanche in the next seven years. After both the Stars and the Avalanche split the first four games at a 2\u20132 series tie, the Avalanche won Game 5 by a score of 7\u20135, taking a 3\u20132 series lead, The Stars rallied winning game six on the road, and Game 7 at home, both by 4\u20131 scorelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/NHL_1999.html |title=1999 NHL Playoffs Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\nThis was the Stars' first [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup Finals]] appearance as the Dallas Stars, although they made the finals twice as the Minnesota North Stars. They faced the Eastern Conference champion [[Buffalo Sabres]], who had defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4\u20131 in the Eastern Conference Finals. After splitting the first four games, the Stars vaunted defense would hold the Sabres to only one goal in the next two, winning Game 5 2\u20130 and Game 6 2\u20131 on an overtime goal by Brett Hull. Hull's goal at 14:51 of the third overtime was remembered as one of the most controversial goals ever scored. That season, the league still had the infamous \"crease rule\" in effect, which provided that if any player of the attacking team who did not have possession of the puck was in the crease before the puck, then any resulting goal was disallowed. Hull had initially gained possession of the puck outside the crease and had made a shot that was blocked by Buffalo goaltender [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek|Dominik Hasek]]. One of Hull's skates entered the crease as he corralled the rebound, and Hull's second shot scored the Cup-winning goal, followed by a lengthy official review. The goal was eventually allowed, as having simply blocked Hull's shot rather than catching it, Hasek never took possession of the puck away from Hull. Officials therefore determined that rather than calling it a loose puck, Hull would be considered to have had continuous possession of the puck from before his first shot outside the crease. The complexity of the crease rule, and the attendant difficulties in understanding its application by fans and players alike, combined with the controversy arising out of the disputed Stanley Cup-winning goal, resulted in the crease rule being repealed the following season. Hull's goal marked the 13th time a Stanley Cup-winning goal was scored in overtime, and only the fourth to be scored in multiple overtimes. This was the only time between [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|1995]] and [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|2003]] that a team other than the New Jersey Devils, Colorado Avalanche or Detroit Red Wings won the Stanley Cup.\n\nThe team added veterans [[Kirk Muller]], [[Dave Manson]] and [[Sylvain C\u00f4t\u00e9|Sylvain Cote]] in an effort to defend their Stanley Cup championship in {{NHL Year|1999}}. On December 31, 1999, Brett Hull scored his 600 and 601st career goals in a 5\u20134 win over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The Stars ultimately won the Pacific Division for the second year in a row, and were seeded second in the Western Conference. Dallas then defeated the Edmonton Oilers and San Jose Sharks in the first and second rounds, both 4\u20131 series victories. The Stars, for the second season in a row, defeated the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference Finals in seven games to reach their second consecutive Stanley Cup Finals, where they met the New Jersey Devils. Because the Devils finished the regular season with one more point than Dallas, the Stars had to play their first playoff series without home ice advantage since 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2000.html |title=1999-00 NHL Season Summary |publisher=Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> The Stars lost all three games at the Reunion Arena in the Finals, and lost the series in Game 6 on a double-overtime goal by New Jersey forward [[Jason Arnott]].\n\n====Unsuccessful playoff runs====\nHoping to win back the Stanley Cup, the Stars again captured the Pacific Division, posting a solid 48\u201324\u20138\u20132 record in the [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301 season]]. In the playoffs, the Stars met the Edmonton Oilers in the first round, battling back-and-forth through the first four games, with each game decided by one goal, including three going into overtime. Game 5 would also go to overtime, as the Stars took a 3\u20132 series lead on a goal by Kirk Muller. However, in Game 6 in [[Edmonton]], the Stars did not need overtime, advancing to the second round with a 3\u20131 win. Facing the St. Louis Blues, the Stars would run out of gas, being swept in four straight games. The Game 2 loss would be the last NHL game played in Reunion Arena.\n[[File:MartyTurco.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marty Turco]] was awarded the starting goaltender position in the 2001\u201302 season, with the departure of [[Ed Belfour]] to free agency.]]\nMoving into the brand new [[American Airlines Center]] for the [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2001\u201302 season]], the Stars got off to a slow start to the season, as goaltender Ed Belfour struggled through one of his worst seasons. Head coach Ken Hitchcock was eventually fired, being replaced by [[Rick Wilson (ice hockey)|Rick Wilson]]. Despite the coaching change, the Stars continued to play poor hockey. With the prospect of missing the playoffs, the Stars traded 1999 Conn Smythe winner Joe Nieuwendyk and [[Jamie Langenbrunner]] to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for [[Randy McKay]] and Jason Arnott, who scored the game-winning goal in the 2000 Finals against Dallas. The Stars would eventually go on to post a respectable record of 35\u201328\u201313\u20135. However, it would not be enough for the playoffs, as they fell four points short of the final eighth spot in the Western Conference. Following the season, coach Rick Wilson would return to assistant coaching duties, as the Stars brought in [[Dave Tippett]] as his replacement.\n\nAs in the 2002 off-season, Ed Belfour left via free agency to the Toronto Maple Leafs. To begin the [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303 season]], the Stars awarded the starting goaltending position to [[Marty Turco]], who went on to have one of the best seasons in NHL history, posting the lowest goals against average (GAA) since 1940, at 1.76. However, missing 18 games late in the season likely cost him a shot at the [[Vezina Trophy]], awarded to the leagues's top regular season goaltender. Regardless, the Stars posted the best record in the Western Conference at 46\u201317\u201315\u20134, and along the way, two-way star Jere Lehtinen won his third Frank J. Selke Trophy. In the [[2003 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]], the Stars once again met the Edmonton Oilers, and once again the Oilers would prove a contentious opponent, winning two of the first three games. However, the Stars would prove the better team again by winning the next three games to take the series in six games. The Stars' second round series against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim got off to an unbelievable start, as the game went deep into overtime tied 3\u20133. However, Mighty Ducks goaltender [[Jean-S\u00e9bastien Gigu\u00e8re|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]] stopped 60 shots as the Ducks scored early in the fifth overtime. Game 2 would be more of the same, as the Ducks stunned the Stars in overtime. Desperately needing a win, the Stars bounced back to take Game 3 in Anaheim. However, the Ducks would take a 3\u20131 series lead by breaking a scoreless tie late in the third period of Game 4. In Game 5, the Stars finally solved Giguere by scoring four goals to keep their playoff hopes alive. However, the Stars dreams of a return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals would end in heartbreaking fashionm as the Ducks broke a 3\u20133 tie with 1:06 left in Game 6 on a goal by defenseman [[Sandis Ozoli\u0146\u0161|Sandis Ozolinsh]].\n\nComing off their disappointing playoff loss, the Stars would get off to a shaky start to the [[2003\u201304 NHL Season|2003\u201304 season]], as they played mediocre hockey through the first three months of the season, posting a sub-.500 record. However, as the calendar turned to 2004, the Stars began to find their game, as they posted a 9\u20134\u20133 record in January. As the season wore on, the Stars would get stronger, climbing up the playoff ladder and eventually reaching second place in the Pacific Division, where they finished with a solid 41\u201326\u201313\u20132 record; Marty Turco had another outstanding season, recording a 1.98 GAA. However, the Stars could not carry their momentum into the playoffs, as they were beaten by the Colorado Avalanche in five games in the first round.\n\n===Post-lockout era (2005\u20132008)===\nComing out of the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout|owners' lockout]] that cancelled the entire [[2004\u201305 NHL season|2004\u201305 season]], the Stars remained one of the strongest teams in the Western Conference for the start of [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306]], as they won four of their first five games on the way to a solid October. November would be even better for Dallas, as they won 10 of 13 games and took over first place in the Pacific Division, a position they would hold most of the season, as they went on to finish with a terrific record of 53\u201323\u20136. One reason for the Stars success was their strong play in shootouts, as forward [[Jussi Jokinen]] was nearly automatic, making 10-of-13 shot attempts. Also performing strong in shootouts was Sergei Zubov, who used a slow-but-steady backhand to go 7-for-12, as the Stars ultimately won 12 of 13 games that were settled by a shootout. As the number two seed in the Western Conference, the Stars faced the seventh-seeded Colorado Avalanche. The Stars were favorited to win the Western Conference, and some even predicted them to win the Stanley Cup. However, the Stars would stumble right from the start, losing Game 1 by a score of 5\u20132 as the Avalanche scored five unanswered goals after the Stars jumped out to a promising 2\u20130 lead. Game 2 would see the Stars suffer another setback at home, as the Stars lost in overtime 5\u20134 on a goal by [[Joe Sakic]]. On the road in Game 3, the Stars led 3\u20132 in the final minute before the Avalanche forced overtime on a goal by [[Andrew Brunette]], while [[Alex Tanguay]] won the game just 69 seconds into overtime to put the Stars in a 3\u20130 hole. The Stars would avoid the sweep with 4\u20131 win in Game 4, but overtime would doom them again in Game 5, as Andrew Brunette scored the series winner at 6:05, ending the Stars' playoffs hopes after just five games.\n\n====Dallas hosts the All-Star Game (2006\u20132007 season)====\nFollowing the previous season's disappointing first round playoff upset at the hands of the seventh-seeded Avalanche, the Stars made a number of changes during the 2006 off-season. Former Stars goalkeeper Andy Moog was promoted to assistant general manager for player development (he kept his job as goaltending coach) and former player [[Ulf Dahl\u00e9n|Ulf Dahlen]] was hired as an assistant coach. The Stars allowed center Jason Arnott, defenseman [[Willie Mitchell (ice hockey)|Willie Mitchell]] and goaltender [[Johan Hedberg]] to leave as [[free agents]]. Forward [[Niko Kapanen]] was traded to the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] and the remaining two years on fan-favorite [[winger (ice hockey)|right winger]] [[Bill Guerin]]'s contract were bought out. The Stars also received [[Patrik \u0160tefan|Patrik Stefan]] and [[Jaroslav Modr\u00fd|Jaroslav Modry]] in the Atlanta trade, and signed [[Eric Lindros]], [[Jeff Halpern]], [[Matthew Barnaby]] and [[Darryl Sydor]] as free agents. Young goaltender [[Mike Smith (ice hockey, born 1982)|Mike Smith]] was promoted to the NHL to serve as Marty Turco's backup. During the season, key future pieces \u2013 center [[Mike Ribeiro]] and defenseman [[Mattias Norstr\u00f6m|Mattias Norstrom]] \u2013 were added through separate trades. Young players [[Joel Lundqvist]], [[Krys Barch]], [[Nicklas Grossmann]] and [[Chris Conner]] all saw significant ice time while other players were out of the lineup with injuries.\n[[File:Modano Record Goal.jpg|thumb|[[Mike Modano]] scoring his 500th goal on November 7, 2007 against the [[San Jose Sharks]].

On March 17, Modano scored his 502nd and 503rd NHL goals, breaking the record for an American-born player, previously held by [[Joe Mullen]].\n\nOn January 24, 2007, the [[2007 National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]] was held at the [[American Airlines Center]]. Defenseman [[Philippe Boucher]] and goaltender Marty Turco would represent the Stars as part of the Western Conference All-Star roster. The Stars qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Western Conference and squared off against the Vancouver Canucks in the first round.

Off-season free agent acquisition [[Sean Avery]] caused a media uproar over comments he made to a Canadian reporter about ex-girlfriend [[Elisha Cuthbert]] and her relationship with [[Calgary Flames]]' defenseman [[Dion Phaneuf]] before a game in [[Calgary]]. The incident forced the team to suspend Avery for the season; he was later waived by the Stars. That incident, plus injuries to key players Brad Richards and Sergei Zubov, caused the Stars to tailspin to a 12th-place finish and the first missed playoffs for Dallas since 2002.\n\nIn the wake of the season, the Stars hired a new general manager, former player and alternate captain Joe Nieuwendyk. Hull and Jackson remained with the Stars, but were reassigned to new roles within the organization. Less than a week after he was hired, Nieuwendyk fired six-season head coach Dave Tippett on June 10, 2009, and hired [[Marc Crawford]] the next day as his replacement.

Inconsistent play and defensive struggles plagued the team throughout the season, as they failed to adjust to Marc Crawford's new offensively-minded system, and owner Tom Hicks' financial troubles prevented the team from spending more than $45&nbsp;million on payroll, over $11&nbsp;million beneath the league salary cap.<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/hockey/stars/stories/020910dnspostarshicks.327a05b.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212111804/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/hockey/stars/stories/020910dnspostarshicks.327a05b.html |date=February 12, 2010 }}</ref> The Stars failed to win more than three games in a row all season, finished in last in the Pacific Division and repeated their 12th place conference finish from the year before with a record of 37\u201331\u201314 for 88 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/standings |title=2011\u201312 NHL Preseason Conference Standings \u2013 National Hockey League|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> This was the first time that they would miss the playoffs two seasons in a row since the Stars moved to Texas.

Modano subsequently signed with the Detroit Red Wings while Turco joined the Chicago Blackhawks. Winger Jere Lehtinen, who played his entire career with the Stars, announced his retirement in December 2010. The team also made key acquisitions, such as winger [[Adam Burish]] (who was on the 2010 Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks) and goaltender [[Andrew Raycroft]]. They also gave [[Jonathan Cheechoo]] a try-out, but he was cut and later signed with division rivals San Jose Sharks.\n\nTo begin the [[2010\u201311 NHL season|2010\u201311 season]], the Stars won their first three games, going on a three-game win streak for the first time since the 2007\u201308 season by beating the New Jersey Devils in overtime, [[New York Islanders]] in a shootout and against Mike Modano and the Red Wings. During the third game against the Red Wings, the Stars crowd gave Modano a standing ovation as he was shown on the [[Jumbotron]].\n\nAfter a hot start to the season, the Stars dominated the first half of the season, staying on the Pacific Division lead and staying in the top three spots of the conference. It seemed like the old Stars were back, as through the first half of the season, they went 30\u201315\u20136. But after the All-Star Game, the Stars went into a slump, going on numerous losing streaks and blowing games. Through this though, the Stars still remained in the playoff picture. On the day of the trade deadline, the Stars traded [[James Neal (ice hockey)|James Neal]] and [[Matt Niskanen]] to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for defenseman [[Alex Goligoski]].

Throughout March, the Stars regained the lead of the Pacific Division. Beginning on March 26, 2012, the Stars embarked on a western road trip that saw them visit the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks. Going into the road trip, the Stars were in control of their own destiny, having to gain four points on the road trip to win their first Pacific Division title since the 2005\u201306 season. After the Stars lost 5\u20134 in Calgary to the Flames, the Stars beat the Oilers two nights later, 3\u20131. This would be their last win of the season, as the Stars were rolled over by the Canucks and Sharks.

The original broadcast team from 1993 to 1996 was Mike Fornes (play-by-play) and [[Ralph Strangis]] (color). Fornes left the broadcast team after the 1995\u201396 season; Strangis moved to the play-by-play role and color commentator [[Daryl Reaugh|Daryl \"Razor\" Reaugh]] was added. Although both the DFW-area's large media market and the team's fan base could theoretically support separate television and radio broadcast teams, the Stars have continued simulcasting due to the popularity of \"Ralph and Razor\" (as they are known) among local listeners and viewers. Like other NHL teams, the Stars now have a live radio broadcast transmitted inside American Airlines Center on 97.5 FM. This is done because AM radio signals often cannot penetrate concrete and steel building exteriors.\n\nStrangis retired from the booth after the 2014\u201315 season and was replaced by [[Dave Strader]].

After the game, the Stars saluted Strader at center ice. On October 1, 2017, Strader died of cancer at age 62, leaving Reaugh and Ludwig to call the 2017\u201318 season.

For the 1999\u20132000 season, it became the primary away uniform, and was paired with a new home uniform featuring the same basic design, with white on top and green at the bottom. They kept this design until the 2006\u201307 season, during which the league switched color designations on home and away jerseys in the 2003\u201304 season.

However, fans and critics derided the uniform crest for its resemblance to a [[uterus]], nicknaming it the \"Mooterus\". The uniform was used until the 2005\u201306 season.\n\nWith the switch to the [[Reebok]] Edge uniform system, the jerseys underwent a complete redesign. The home black jersey, introduced for the 2007\u201308 season, features the player's number on the chest and an arched 'Dallas' in white with gold trim, with the primary logo on the shoulders. The primary away jerseys, which were used from 2007\u201310 and was used as an alternate for its final season, had the Stars logo crest in front and the uniform number on the top right, with the Texas alternate logo on the shoulders. An alternate white jersey based on the home black jersey was introduced for the 2008\u201309 season; they became the regular away uniforms for the 2010\u201311 season. The lettering is in green with gold and black trim. Both uniforms were used until the 2012\u201313 season.\n\nA new logo and uniforms were introduced for the 2013\u201314 season. Silver replaced gold as the tertiary color, while green (in a bright new shade called \"Victory Green\", similar to the old North Stars' shade of green) was reintroduced as a primary uniform color. The new logo features the letter D centering a star, symbolizing Dallas' nickname as \"The Big D\". The home uniforms are in green with black and white striping, while the away uniforms are in white with a green shoulder yoke, and black and green striping. The inner collar features the team name on the home uniforms, and the city name on the away uniforms. The secondary logo, with the primary inside a roundel with the team name, is featured in the shoulders.\n\nThe Stars unveiled a special edition uniform for the [[2020 NHL Winter Classic]], featuring a design inspired from the defunct [[United States Hockey League|USHL]] [[Dallas Texans (USHL)|Dallas Texans]] hockey club. The uniform features the word \"Stars\" (with the star substituting for the letter A) in the middle of the big letter \"D\". Both are in white with silver trim. A silhouette of the state of Texas in silver and green trim with the letter \"D\" inside adorns the left sleeve.\n\n===Minor league affiliates===\n[[File:Texas Stars logo.svg|150px|thumb|The [[Texas Stars]], based in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]], are the Stars current [[American Hockey League]] affiliate.]]\nThe Dallas Stars are presently affiliated with two [[minor league]] teams. The [[Texas Stars]] are the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate of the Dallas Stars, who after becoming unaffiliated with the [[Iowa Chops|Iowa Stars]] in 2008, did not have an AHL affiliate for the 2008\u201309 season. The [[Texas Stars]] began play in the AHL in the 2009\u201310 season as an affiliate for Dallas. They are located in [[Cedar Park, Texas]] (northwest of [[Austin]]).\n\nIn addition to their AHL affiliate, the Dallas Stars are also affiliated with the [[Idaho Steelheads]] of the [[ECHL]]. Based in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], the Steelheads have played home games in [[CenturyLink Arena Boise]] since 2003.\n\n===Traditions===\nSince the 2005\u201306 season, the national anthems are performed by Celena Rae, a [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] native and former semi-finalist on ''[[American Idol]]''. During \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", the fans yell the word \"stars\" in the lines \"whose broad stripes and bright stars\" and \"O say does that star spangled banner yet wave\".<ref>[http://stars.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=76380 Dallas Stars | Game Personalities - Dallas Stars - Fan Zone].

Members of the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas\u2013Fort Worth\u2013Arlington]] metropolitan area band had become friends with members of the Stars in the 1990s, especially following the team's Stanley Cup win in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hookedonhockeymagazine.com/dallas-stars-and-the-mystery-dent-in-the-stanley-cup/|title=The Dallas Stars and the Mystery Dent in the Stanley Cup|last=Carlton|first=Brendon|website=hookedonhockeymagazine.com|access-date=2017-01-15}}</ref> \"Puck Off\" later also became the team's goal celebration song. During the song, fans chant the only lyrics in the song, \"Dallas! Stars! Dallas! Stars!\" while pumping their fists in the air. After a penalty on the opposing team is announced, Stars public address announcer shouts, \u201cYour Dallas Stars are on...the...\u201d with the fans finishing \u201cpower play!\u201d, immediately after which a clip of the [[Muse (band)|Muse]] song \u201c[[Knights of Cydonia]]\u201d is played. After each Stars win, the [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] (a Dallas native) and [[Double Trouble (band)|Double Trouble]] song \"The House is a Rockin'\" is played. A song of unknown origin called \"The Darkness Music\" is played after nearly every away goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stars.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=449894|title=Darkness music a big hit.
