Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

A small number of Turkic people also live in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]].

[[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins.

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

A small number of Turkic people also live in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]].

[[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins.

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

As part of her investigation, she finds she needs the knowledge and experience of Walter Bishop, currently institutionalized in a mental hospital. Olivia blackmails Walter's estranged son, Peter, to be Walter's legal guardian, allowing his release from the institution. Olivia finds that Walter's knowledge in the area of fringe science to be critical for her job, and convinces Peter to remain as Walter's guardian; Peter, initially resentful due to events in his childhood, starts to participate directly in the cases, his abilities as a jack-of-all-trades being a benefit to both Walter's scientific needs and Olivia's investigations. Walter himself struggles with life outside the institution, plagued by a secret from his past and often resorting to recreational drugs. Olivia comes to discover that Massive Dynamic, a company that Walter used to be a part of, is connected with several of the Fringe cases.\n\nThe Fringe team starts to learn of a bio-terrorist group known as ZFT (in German, Zerst\u00f6rung durch Fortschritte der Technologie, translated as \"Destruction by Advancement of Technology\"), which seem to be after several of Walter's old experiments. In one case, a group of men led by Mitchell Loeb have recreated Walter's technology used to pass through solid matter to steal several components of a device constructed by Walter from banks. With the assembled device, Loeb's team is able to teleport David Robert Jones, a former Massive Dynamics employee and leader of the ZFT, out of a high security prison. Jones attempts to sway Olivia to his side as a \"soldier\" in an upcoming \"war,\" making her aware that she, as a child, was part of a test run by Walter and his partner William Bell of the [[nootropic]] drug, Cortexiphan, that gave her psychokinetic powers. Olivia refuses, disbelieving his claim but realizing that evidence to support it appears true. Meanwhile, the Observer meets with Walter and takes him to Walter's old beach house, where he finds a device he once made that can close a portal to a parallel universe. Tracking Jones, Olivia finds that all of the Fringe events have formed a spiral, centering on Reiden Lake in New York, and she, Peter, and Walter are able to prevent Jones from crossing over to a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] using the device that Walter found, killing Jones in the process. Later Walter is seen at  a cemetery where he mourns over a grave labeled \"Peter Bishop.\"\n\nOlivia tries to get answers from Nina Sharp on Jones' motive, but she only directs her to a meeting with Bell. Olivia, while en route to the meeting, finds herself in the parallel universe, in the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] office of William Bell.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{See also|List of Fringe episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#000 |overall=5 |season=5 |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |viewers= |country=US |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Fringe (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = [[Pilot (Fringe)|Pilot]]\n |DirectedBy = [[Alex Graves]]\n |WrittenBy = [[J.

Upon 'waking up,' he does not have any memory of what happened while hypnotized. Similar cases have ended with the victim being returned, but left insane from the trauma of the incident. As they investigate, they discover that each case dealt with a genius of some sort working on an unfinished equation. To discover the child's whereabouts, Olivia encourages Walter to return to St. Claire's Hospital and speak with his old bunkmate, Dashiell Kim ([[Randall Duk Kim]]) a former mathematician who disappeared under similar circumstances. The visit does not go well, and Walter is held by the hospital administrator, who remains unconvinced of Walter's sanity. Walter manages to coerce his bunk mate into giving up a vague idea of his whereabouts, which Olivia and Peter use to find the boy once they arrange for Walter's release. However, the kidnapper, Joanne Ostler ([[Gillian Jacobs]]), escapes with the completed formula, which she gives to Mitchell Loeb (Chance Kelly), who calibrates a frequency generator in such a way to allow him to pass through solid matter.\n |LineColor = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Fringe (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = [[The Dreamscape]]\n |DirectedBy = Frederick E.

As insurance, Jones has developed an [[adhesive]] which causes the orifices of those exposed to it to seal up, suffocating them. A bomb containing the toxin is set to go off if Olivia cannot pass his tests. The first test is to shut off a series of lights using only her mind.

As part of her investigation, she finds she needs the knowledge and experience of Walter Bishop, currently institutionalized in a mental hospital. Olivia blackmails Walter's estranged son, Peter, to be Walter's legal guardian, allowing his release from the institution. Olivia finds that Walter's knowledge in the area of fringe science to be critical for her job, and convinces Peter to remain as Walter's guardian; Peter, initially resentful due to events in his childhood, starts to participate directly in the cases, his abilities as a jack-of-all-trades being a benefit to both Walter's scientific needs and Olivia's investigations. Walter himself struggles with life outside the institution, plagued by a secret from his past and often resorting to recreational drugs. Olivia comes to discover that Massive Dynamic, a company that Walter used to be a part of, is connected with several of the Fringe cases.\n\nThe Fringe team starts to learn of a bio-terrorist group known as ZFT (in German, Zerst\u00f6rung durch Fortschritte der Technologie, translated as \"Destruction by Advancement of Technology\"), which seem to be after several of Walter's old experiments. In one case, a group of men led by Mitchell Loeb have recreated Walter's technology used to pass through solid matter to steal several components of a device constructed by Walter from banks. With the assembled device, Loeb's team is able to teleport David Robert Jones, a former Massive Dynamics employee and leader of the ZFT, out of a high security prison. Jones attempts to sway Olivia to his side as a \"soldier\" in an upcoming \"war,\" making her aware that she, as a child, was part of a test run by Walter and his partner William Bell of the [[nootropic]] drug, Cortexiphan, that gave her psychokinetic powers. Olivia refuses, disbelieving his claim but realizing that evidence to support it appears true. Meanwhile, the Observer meets with Walter and takes him to Walter's old beach house, where he finds a device he once made that can close a portal to a parallel universe. Tracking Jones, Olivia finds that all of the Fringe events have formed a spiral, centering on Reiden Lake in New York, and she, Peter, and Walter are able to prevent Jones from crossing over to a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] using the device that Walter found, killing Jones in the process. Later Walter is seen at  a cemetery where he mourns over a grave labeled \"Peter Bishop.\"\n\nOlivia tries to get answers from Nina Sharp on Jones' motive, but she only directs her to a meeting with Bell. Olivia, while en route to the meeting, finds herself in the parallel universe, in the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] office of William Bell.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{See also|List of Fringe episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#000 |overall=5 |season=5 |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |viewers= |country=US |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Fringe (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = [[Pilot (Fringe)|Pilot]]\n |DirectedBy = [[Alex Graves]]\n |WrittenBy = [[J.

Upon 'waking up,' he does not have any memory of what happened while hypnotized. Similar cases have ended with the victim being returned, but left insane from the trauma of the incident. As they investigate, they discover that each case dealt with a genius of some sort working on an unfinished equation. To discover the child's whereabouts, Olivia encourages Walter to return to St. Claire's Hospital and speak with his old bunkmate, Dashiell Kim ([[Randall Duk Kim]]) a former mathematician who disappeared under similar circumstances. The visit does not go well, and Walter is held by the hospital administrator, who remains unconvinced of Walter's sanity. Walter manages to coerce his bunk mate into giving up a vague idea of his whereabouts, which Olivia and Peter use to find the boy once they arrange for Walter's release. However, the kidnapper, Joanne Ostler ([[Gillian Jacobs]]), escapes with the completed formula, which she gives to Mitchell Loeb (Chance Kelly), who calibrates a frequency generator in such a way to allow him to pass through solid matter.\n |LineColor = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Fringe (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = [[The Dreamscape]]\n |DirectedBy = Frederick E.

As insurance, Jones has developed an [[adhesive]] which causes the orifices of those exposed to it to seal up, suffocating them. A bomb containing the toxin is set to go off if Olivia cannot pass his tests. The first test is to shut off a series of lights using only her mind.

Ben was the leader of a group of island natives called the [[Others (Lost)|Others]] and was initially known as '''Henry Gale''' to the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815.  He began as the main [[antagonist]] during the second and third seasons, but in subsequent seasons, becomes a morally ambiguous ally to the main characters. Other characters frequently describe him as loyal only to himself, though it is also often hinted that he may be driven by some higher purpose.\n\n<!--Out of universe character development summary-->As with most characters on ''Lost'', Ben's history is revealed through flashbacks and episodes set in other time periods which are revealed slowly as the series progresses. [[Sterling Beaumon]] first portrayed a young Ben late in season three, in the character's first centric episode, \"[[The Man Behind the Curtain]]\". Ben's childhood is further explored in the [[Lost (season 5)|fifth season]] of the series, partially set in 1977. Fifth season episode \"[[Dead Is Dead]]\" explores Ben's fragile state following the events of the [[Lost (season 4)|fourth season]], in which his loyalty to the island led to the death of his adoptive daughter [[Alex Rousseau]] ([[Tania Raymonde]]), and flashbacks show the audience Ben's original acquisition of Alex and his rise to leadership of the Others, after exiling his rival [[Charles Widmore]] ([[Alan Dale]]). Originally cast for three guest appearances in the second season, Emerson's role was expanded. As leader of the Others, Ben became a regular cast member from the [[Lost (season 3)|third season]] onward. Reviews of the show would often focus on Ben's mysterious motives. Emerson's portrayal garnered many positive reviews, resulting in nominations for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor]] year-on-year from 2007 to 2010, winning in 2009.\n\nIn 2010, Ben Linus was ranked #24 on the [[TV Guide Network]] special ''25 Greatest TV Characters of All Time''.<ref>{{Cite AV media|type=TV production\n | title = 25 Greatest TV Characters of All Time\n | publisher = [[TV Guide Network]]\n | airdate = September 19, 2010\n | language = English\n}}</ref> In 2016, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him #1 of their \"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/40-greatest-tv-villains-of-all-time-20160209 |title=40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Sean T. |last=Collins |date=February 9, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427201150/http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/40-greatest-tv-villains-of-all-time-20160209 |archive-date=April 27, 2016 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Arc==\n===Prior to the crash===\nFlashbacks during \"[[The Man Behind the Curtain]]\" show Benjamin Linus being born in the woods outside of [[Portland, Oregon]], to [[Characters of Lost#Dharma Initiative members|Roger]] ([[Jon Gries]]) and Emily Linus ([[Carrie Preston]]). Emily dies after giving birth to Ben. When Ben is young, he and his father move to the Island, after Roger is offered a job working for the [[Dharma Initiative]]. On the Island, Ben begins to see visions of his mother, while Roger starts drinking heavily and [[Physical abuse|physically]] and [[Verbal abuse|verbally abusing]] him. Ben develops a hatred for the Dharma Initiative and one day runs away from the Barracks. He comes across [[Richard Alpert (Lost)|Richard Alpert]] ([[Nestor Carbonell]]), one of the Island natives known to the Initiative as the \"Hostiles\", in the jungle, who grants Ben's request to join his group but tells him he needs to be very patient.<ref name = \"The Man Behind the Curtain\"/>\n\nSeason five's \"[[Namaste (Lost)|Namaste]]\" shows a young Ben coming into contact with a captured [[Sayid Jarrah]] ([[Naveen Andrews]]), who along with several other Oceanic Flight 815 survivors has been brought back in time from 2007. In the following episode, \"[[He's Our You]]\", he helps free Sayid under the impression Sayid was sent by the Others to bring him to Richard. Sayid instead shoots Ben and leaves him for dead. Fellow crash survivor [[Jack Shephard]] ([[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]) refuses to help the boy, so [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]) and [[James \"Sawyer\" Ford]] ([[Josh Holloway]]) take Ben to Richard, who informs them Ben will henceforth lose his innocence and always be one of the Others.

He gets Locke to reveal what he knows about returning to the island, then kills him and stages it as a suicide. Ben visits Jack in the funeral home housing Locke's body, telling Jack he will help him return to the island, but the only way to get back is to bring everyone who had left it, including Locke's corpse. Ben boards Ajira Airways Flight 316 with the rest of survivors, which then crashes on the island. Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid are transported to 1977, while Sun and Ben remain in 2007 with a resurrected Locke. The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him in the back of the head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including Locke. After Ben regains consciousness and finds Locke to be alive, he convinces Locke he knew bringing him to the island would resurrect him, and he stopped Locke's suicide attempt merely to gain information. Locke travels with Ben, who is to be judged by the Monster. After they fail to find the Monster at the Barracks, they head to the Temple. As Ben and Locke travel through a series of tunnels beneath the Temple, Ben falls through the floor, so Locke leaves to get something that he can pull him up with. The Monster flows out of a grate below and surrounds Ben, showing flashes of decisions he made in his life involving Alex. The Monster takes the form of Alex and pushes Ben against a wall. She says she knows Ben is planning to kill Locke again, and if he does she will hunt him down and destroy him. She orders him to follow Locke and do whatever he asks, then disappears. They return to the Others' camp, where Locke gathers the group together and announces he is taking them to see Jacob.<ref>\"Follow the Leader\". Stephen Willams. Writ. Paul Zbyszewski & Elizabeth Sarnoff. ''Lost'' ABC. 2009-05-06. No. 15, season 5</ref> As they are walking, Ben relates his experience with the Monster and his promise to do whatever Locke asks, so Locke convinces Ben to kill Jacob.<ref>The Incident, Part 2</ref> Richard leads them to the base of the statue, where Jacob lives. Within, they are met by Jacob ([[Mark Pellegrino]]). Jacob greets Locke and observes Locke has found a loophole. It is revealed that Locke was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of Locke. Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him \u2013 and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.\n\nAfter Jacob's death, the Monster tells Ben to fetch Richard, as he wants to speak to him. However, when Ben exits the statue, Richard throws him down beside the corpse of the real John Locke, which has been brought to the statue by survivors of the Ajira flight, led by [[Ilana Verdansky]] ([[Zuleikha Robinson]]). Ben is forced by Ilana's group to bring them to the imposter Locke. They start shooting at the Monster, but he disappears, then returns in its black smoke form, killing Ilana's group. The Monster returns to Locke's form and mockingly informs Ben of the real Locke's last thoughts, while being strangled by Ben. Afterwards, Ben comforts Ilana when he finds her crying in Jacob's chamber and sets off with her, Sun, and [[Frank Lapidus]] ([[Jeff Fahey]]) to bury Locke before going to the Temple, where they believe they will be safe from the Monster. At Locke's funeral, Ben provides the eulogy, and expresses his sincere apologies for killing Locke. When they arrive at the Temple, the Monster is destroying the place. They return to the beach as a temporary shelter, and Ben attempts to make amends with everyone for killing Jacob. Ilana then forces him to dig a grave and explains she will kill Ben for murdering her [[father figure]]. Later, the Monster visits Ben, telling him to join him and then magically frees Ben. After Ben escapes, Ilana chases after him, and the two come face-to-face at the jungle when Ben points a rifle at her. Ben explains to her why he really killed Jacob, particularly grieving his [[Alex Rousseau|daughter]]. Ilana understands and allows him to rejoin their group, which he does. Hurley, Jack, and Richard show up and join their group, then have a meeting, deciding what to do next. Richard suggests they should stop the Monster escaping by blowing up the Ajira plane. After Hurley destroys the available dynamite from the shipwrecked ''Black Rock'', Richard insists he will find other explosives. Ben and Miles join Richard, while the rest decide to go talk to the Monster. When Ben, Richard and Miles arrive at the Barracks, Widmore is there, and is soon joined by the Monster. Ben murders Widmore before he is able to make a deal with the Monster to spare his daughter. The Monster and Ben find Desmond and the Monster forces him to go destroy the Island. They run into Jack's group and they both go to the heart of the Island, where Desmond removes the cork of the Island, causing the Island to begin collapsing. After Jack kills the Monster, Ben and Hurley volunteer to stay behind on the Island with Jack to assist him relighting the Island. Jack tells them he will die doing this and Jack gives Hurley the new position of being protector of the Island. Ben advises him to approach his Island duties with his kindness and helpful attitude. Hurley asks Ben to become his advisor, to which he is honored. After an undisclosed period of time, Ben, on orders from Hurley, arrives at the Dharma Logistics Warehouse in Guam. He speaks to the two workers there and instructs them that the facility is being shut down. Afterward, Ben arrives at the Santa Rosa Mental Hospital and visits Walt. Ben tells him that he is still special and that he can help his father, Michael, even though he is dead, and offers Walt a job to return to the island.\n\nThe afterlife experienced by the survivors is shown during season six. In \"[[The Substitute (Lost)|The Substitute]]\", Ben Linus is shown as a teacher of [[European History]]. In \"[[Dr. Linus]]\", Ben laments his life in general, frustrated with the school bureaucracy and particularly due to Reynolds, the principal who does not care for the school. He is living with his father, Roger ([[Jon Gries]]), who is on [[life support]]. At school, he is shown to have a close relationship with his star pupil, [[Alex Rousseau|Alex]], and befriends a substitute teacher, [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]]. While studying together, Alex tells Ben that Principal Reynolds is having a sexual affair with one of the school nurses on campus.  Ben attempts to blackmail Reynolds, threatening to reveal his [[substantial truth|affair]] and citing his position as principal as the demand. However, Reynolds swiftly retaliates by saying if he makes good on his threats, Alex's chances of going to [[Yale University]] will decrease substantially, as he is requested to write her a [[recommendation letter]]. Wanting to save Alex's educational future, Ben backs down. Days later, Ben notices [[Desmond Hume]] waiting outside the school in his car for an extended amount of time. Desmond runs over Locke, and swiftly drives off. As soon as the ambulance arrives, Ben gets in and sits next to the critically injured Locke, assuring him everything will be all right. When Locke returns to the school, Desmond does as well, and Ben catches him. Desmond beats Ben severely saying he was only trying to help Locke let go. Ben has a vision from his previous life during Desmond's beating. Ben believes him and relays Locke this information. When Alex sees how badly Ben was beaten, she invites him to her house where her mother, Danielle, fixes him supper. Danielle tells Ben that Alex views him as a father, and Ben begins to cry. Ben waits outside the chapel where the Oceanic survivors plan to move on together, and he sees Locke for the last time. Ben sincerely apologizes to Locke for killing him, and Locke forgives him. Hurley later comes out of the chapel and invites Ben in, but Ben politely declines saying he is not ready to move on, saying he \"has a few things to work out\". Hurley accepts this, and tells Ben that he was a \"real good number two\", thanking him for his help in protecting the island. Ben, touched by this, responds \"And you were a great number one, Hugo.\"\n\n==Personality==\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = \"That's what my father does \u2013 he manipulates people.

Ben was the leader of a group of island natives called the [[Others (Lost)|Others]] and was initially known as '''Henry Gale''' to the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815.  He began as the main [[antagonist]] during the second and third seasons, but in subsequent seasons, becomes a morally ambiguous ally to the main characters. Other characters frequently describe him as loyal only to himself, though it is also often hinted that he may be driven by some higher purpose.\n\n<!--Out of universe character development summary-->As with most characters on ''Lost'', Ben's history is revealed through flashbacks and episodes set in other time periods which are revealed slowly as the series progresses. [[Sterling Beaumon]] first portrayed a young Ben late in season three, in the character's first centric episode, \"[[The Man Behind the Curtain]]\". Ben's childhood is further explored in the [[Lost (season 5)|fifth season]] of the series, partially set in 1977. Fifth season episode \"[[Dead Is Dead]]\" explores Ben's fragile state following the events of the [[Lost (season 4)|fourth season]], in which his loyalty to the island led to the death of his adoptive daughter [[Alex Rousseau]] ([[Tania Raymonde]]), and flashbacks show the audience Ben's original acquisition of Alex and his rise to leadership of the Others, after exiling his rival [[Charles Widmore]] ([[Alan Dale]]). Originally cast for three guest appearances in the second season, Emerson's role was expanded. As leader of the Others, Ben became a regular cast member from the [[Lost (season 3)|third season]] onward. Reviews of the show would often focus on Ben's mysterious motives. Emerson's portrayal garnered many positive reviews, resulting in nominations for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor]] year-on-year from 2007 to 2010, winning in 2009.\n\nIn 2010, Ben Linus was ranked #24 on the [[TV Guide Network]] special ''25 Greatest TV Characters of All Time''.<ref>{{Cite AV media|type=TV production\n | title = 25 Greatest TV Characters of All Time\n | publisher = [[TV Guide Network]]\n | airdate = September 19, 2010\n | language = English\n}}</ref> In 2016, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him #1 of their \"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/40-greatest-tv-villains-of-all-time-20160209 |title=40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Sean T. |last=Collins |date=February 9, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427201150/http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/40-greatest-tv-villains-of-all-time-20160209 |archive-date=April 27, 2016 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Arc==\n===Prior to the crash===\nFlashbacks during \"[[The Man Behind the Curtain]]\" show Benjamin Linus being born in the woods outside of [[Portland, Oregon]], to [[Characters of Lost#Dharma Initiative members|Roger]] ([[Jon Gries]]) and Emily Linus ([[Carrie Preston]]). Emily dies after giving birth to Ben. When Ben is young, he and his father move to the Island, after Roger is offered a job working for the [[Dharma Initiative]]. On the Island, Ben begins to see visions of his mother, while Roger starts drinking heavily and [[Physical abuse|physically]] and [[Verbal abuse|verbally abusing]] him. Ben develops a hatred for the Dharma Initiative and one day runs away from the Barracks. He comes across [[Richard Alpert (Lost)|Richard Alpert]] ([[Nestor Carbonell]]), one of the Island natives known to the Initiative as the \"Hostiles\", in the jungle, who grants Ben's request to join his group but tells him he needs to be very patient.<ref name = \"The Man Behind the Curtain\"/>\n\nSeason five's \"[[Namaste (Lost)|Namaste]]\" shows a young Ben coming into contact with a captured [[Sayid Jarrah]] ([[Naveen Andrews]]), who along with several other Oceanic Flight 815 survivors has been brought back in time from 2007. In the following episode, \"[[He's Our You]]\", he helps free Sayid under the impression Sayid was sent by the Others to bring him to Richard. Sayid instead shoots Ben and leaves him for dead. Fellow crash survivor [[Jack Shephard]] ([[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]) refuses to help the boy, so [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]) and [[James \"Sawyer\" Ford]] ([[Josh Holloway]]) take Ben to Richard, who informs them Ben will henceforth lose his innocence and always be one of the Others. In 1987 (or possibly 1992) he assists the hostiles in using poisonous gas to kill the Dharma Initiative, including his father.<ref name = \"The Man Behind the Curtain\">{{cite episode | title = The Man Behind the Curtain | episodelink = The Man Behind the Curtain | series = Lost | serieslink = Lost (TV series) | credits = [[Bobby Roth]] (director); [[Elizabeth Sarnoff]] & [[Drew Goddard]] (writers) | network = ABC | airdate = 2007-05-09 | season = 3 | number = 20}}</ref> In 1988, Charles Widmore, leader of the Others, sends Ben to kill French scientist [[Danielle Rousseau]] ([[Melissa Farman]]), who was marooned on the island. However, when Ben learns Rousseau has a child, he kidnaps the baby [[Alex Rousseau]], warning Rousseau to never come looking for the baby if she wants either of them to live.

He gets Locke to reveal what he knows about returning to the island, then kills him and stages it as a suicide. Ben visits Jack in the funeral home housing Locke's body, telling Jack he will help him return to the island, but the only way to get back is to bring everyone who had left it, including Locke's corpse. Ben boards Ajira Airways Flight 316 with the rest of survivors, which then crashes on the island. Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid are transported to 1977, while Sun and Ben remain in 2007 with a resurrected Locke. The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him in the back of the head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including Locke. After Ben regains consciousness and finds Locke to be alive, he convinces Locke he knew bringing him to the island would resurrect him, and he stopped Locke's suicide attempt merely to gain information. Locke travels with Ben, who is to be judged by the Monster. After they fail to find the Monster at the Barracks, they head to the Temple. As Ben and Locke travel through a series of tunnels beneath the Temple, Ben falls through the floor, so Locke leaves to get something that he can pull him up with. The Monster flows out of a grate below and surrounds Ben, showing flashes of decisions he made in his life involving Alex. The Monster takes the form of Alex and pushes Ben against a wall. She says she knows Ben is planning to kill Locke again, and if he does she will hunt him down and destroy him. She orders him to follow Locke and do whatever he asks, then disappears. They return to the Others' camp, where Locke gathers the group together and announces he is taking them to see Jacob.<ref>\"Follow the Leader\". Stephen Willams. Writ. Paul Zbyszewski & Elizabeth Sarnoff. ''Lost'' ABC. 2009-05-06.

Within, they are met by Jacob ([[Mark Pellegrino]]). Jacob greets Locke and observes Locke has found a loophole. It is revealed that Locke was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of Locke. Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him \u2013 and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.\n\nAfter Jacob's death, the Monster tells Ben to fetch Richard, as he wants to speak to him. However, when Ben exits the statue, Richard throws him down beside the corpse of the real John Locke, which has been brought to the statue by survivors of the Ajira flight, led by [[Ilana Verdansky]] ([[Zuleikha Robinson]]). Ben is forced by Ilana's group to bring them to the imposter Locke. They start shooting at the Monster, but he disappears, then returns in its black smoke form, killing Ilana's group. The Monster returns to Locke's form and mockingly informs Ben of the real Locke's last thoughts, while being strangled by Ben. Afterwards, Ben comforts Ilana when he finds her crying in Jacob's chamber and sets off with her, Sun, and [[Frank Lapidus]] ([[Jeff Fahey]]) to bury Locke before going to the Temple, where they believe they will be safe from the Monster. At Locke's funeral, Ben provides the eulogy, and expresses his sincere apologies for killing Locke. When they arrive at the Temple, the Monster is destroying the place. They return to the beach as a temporary shelter, and Ben attempts to make amends with everyone for killing Jacob. Ilana then forces him to dig a grave and explains she will kill Ben for murdering her [[father figure]]. Later, the Monster visits Ben, telling him to join him and then magically frees Ben. After Ben escapes, Ilana chases after him, and the two come face-to-face at the jungle when Ben points a rifle at her. Ben explains to her why he really killed Jacob, particularly grieving his [[Alex Rousseau|daughter]]. Ilana understands and allows him to rejoin their group, which he does. Hurley, Jack, and Richard show up and join their group, then have a meeting, deciding what to do next. Richard suggests they should stop the Monster escaping by blowing up the Ajira plane. After Hurley destroys the available dynamite from the shipwrecked ''Black Rock'', Richard insists he will find other explosives. Ben and Miles join Richard, while the rest decide to go talk to the Monster. When Ben, Richard and Miles arrive at the Barracks, Widmore is there, and is soon joined by the Monster. Ben murders Widmore before he is able to make a deal with the Monster to spare his daughter. The Monster and Ben find Desmond and the Monster forces him to go destroy the Island. They run into Jack's group and they both go to the heart of the Island, where Desmond removes the cork of the Island, causing the Island to begin collapsing. After Jack kills the Monster, Ben and Hurley volunteer to stay behind on the Island with Jack to assist him relighting the Island. Jack tells them he will die doing this and Jack gives Hurley the new position of being protector of the Island. Ben advises him to approach his Island duties with his kindness and helpful attitude. Hurley asks Ben to become his advisor, to which he is honored. After an undisclosed period of time, Ben, on orders from Hurley, arrives at the Dharma Logistics Warehouse in Guam. He speaks to the two workers there and instructs them that the facility is being shut down. Afterward, Ben arrives at the Santa Rosa Mental Hospital and visits Walt. Ben tells him that he is still special and that he can help his father, Michael, even though he is dead, and offers Walt a job to return to the island.\n\nThe afterlife experienced by the survivors is shown during season six. In \"[[The Substitute (Lost)|The Substitute]]\", Ben Linus is shown as a teacher of [[European History]]. In \"[[Dr. Linus]]\", Ben laments his life in general, frustrated with the school bureaucracy and particularly due to Reynolds, the principal who does not care for the school. He is living with his father, Roger ([[Jon Gries]]), who is on [[life support]]. At school, he is shown to have a close relationship with his star pupil, [[Alex Rousseau|Alex]], and befriends a substitute teacher, [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]]. While studying together, Alex tells Ben that Principal Reynolds is having a sexual affair with one of the school nurses on campus.  Ben attempts to blackmail Reynolds, threatening to reveal his [[substantial truth|affair]] and citing his position as principal as the demand. However, Reynolds swiftly retaliates by saying if he makes good on his threats, Alex's chances of going to [[Yale University]] will decrease substantially, as he is requested to write her a [[recommendation letter]]. Wanting to save Alex's educational future, Ben backs down. Days later, Ben notices [[Desmond Hume]] waiting outside the school in his car for an extended amount of time. Desmond runs over Locke, and swiftly drives off. As soon as the ambulance arrives, Ben gets in and sits next to the critically injured Locke, assuring him everything will be all right. When Locke returns to the school, Desmond does as well, and Ben catches him. Desmond beats Ben severely saying he was only trying to help Locke let go. Ben has a vision from his previous life during Desmond's beating. Ben believes him and relays Locke this information. When Alex sees how badly Ben was beaten, she invites him to her house where her mother, Danielle, fixes him supper. Danielle tells Ben that Alex views him as a father, and Ben begins to cry. Ben waits outside the chapel where the Oceanic survivors plan to move on together, and he sees Locke for the last time. Ben sincerely apologizes to Locke for killing him, and Locke forgives him. Hurley later comes out of the chapel and invites Ben in, but Ben politely declines saying he is not ready to move on, saying he \"has a few things to work out\". Hurley accepts this, and tells Ben that he was a \"real good number two\", thanking him for his help in protecting the island. Ben, touched by this, responds \"And you were a great number one, Hugo.\"\n\n==Personality==\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = \"That's what my father does \u2013 he manipulates people.
