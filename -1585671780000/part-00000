Late communism produced sizable, specific middle classes of relatively well-educated professionals, technicians and even highly skilled blue-collar workers. [...] These classes had no attachment whatsoever to Marxist-Leninist ideology, while they became attracted to the Western way of life. Many members of the ruling 'nomenklatura' shared the same sentiments, as Western consumerism and individualism seemed more attractive to them than communist collective Puritanism. There were two very important consequences of this, one economic, and the second political. The economic one was the attractiveness of consumerism [...]. The political consequence was the pressure to increase the margins of political freedom and public space.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Cross, Gary S.|chapter=1: The Irony of the Century|title=An All-consuming Century: Why Commercialism Won in Modern America|url=https://archive.org/details/allconsumingcent00cros_0|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2000|page=[https://archive.org/details/allconsumingcent00cros_0/page/8 8]|isbn=9780231113120|quote=For East Europeans, the promise of mass consumption was preferable to the nightmare of solidarity even if it meant also the dominance of money and the private control of wealth.

On 4 June 1989, the trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] won an overwhelming victory in a [[1989 Polish legislative election|partially free election in Poland]], leading to the peaceful [[Fall of communism in Poland|fall of Communism in that country]] in the summer of 1989. Also in June 1989, Hungary began dismantling its section of the physical [[Iron Curtain]], leading to an exodus of East Germans through Hungary, which destabilized East Germany. This led to [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations]] in cities such as [[Leipzig]] and subsequently to the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in November 1989, which served as the symbolic gateway to [[German reunification]] in 1990.\n\nThe [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] in December 1991, resulting in eleven new countries ([[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Moldova]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Uzbekistan]]), which had declared their independence from the Soviet Union in the course of the year, while the [[Baltic states]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]) [[Occupation of the Baltic states|regained]] their independence by September 1991. The rest of the Soviet Union, which constituted the bulk of the area, continued with the establishment of the [[Russian Federation]] in December 1991. [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] abandoned Communism between 1990 and 1992. By 1992, Yugoslavia had [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|split into five successor states]], namely [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[North Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Slovenia]] and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was later renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003 and [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|eventually split in 2006]] into two states, [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. Serbia was then further split with the breakaway of the [[International recognition of Kosovo|partially recognized]] state of [[Kosovo]] in 2008. [[Czechoslovakia]] dissolved three years after the [[Velvet Revolution|end of Communist rule]], splitting peacefully into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] in 1992.<ref>{{citation|contributionurl=http://www.cecl.gr/RigasNetwork/databank/Constitutions/Yugoslavia.html|publisher=CECL|date=27 April 1992|place=[[Greece|GR]]|title=Constitution|contribution=Yugoslavia}}.</ref> The impact of these events was felt in many [[socialist countries]]. Communism was abandoned in countries such as [[People's Republic of Kampuchea#Transition and State of Cambodia (1989\u20131992)|Cambodia]] (1991), [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] (1990), [[People's Republic of Mongolia|Mongolia]] (which in 1990 [[1990 Mongolian legislative election|democratically re-elected]] a Communist government that ran the country until [[1996 Mongolian legislative election|1996]]) and [[South Yemen]] (1990).\n\nDuring the adoption of varying forms of [[market economy]], there was a [[1990s#Economics|general decline in living standards]] for many former Communist countries.<ref name=\"Living standards CR\">{{cite book|title= V\u00fdvoj vybran\u00fdch ukazatel\u016f \u017eivotn\u00ed \u00farovn\u011b v \u010cesk\u00e9 republice v letech 1993&nbsp;\u2013 2008| year = 2009 | publisher= Odbor anal\u00fdz a statistiky.

Many communist and socialist organisations in the West turned their guiding principles over to [[social democracy]] and [[democratic socialism]]. Communist parties in [[Italy]] and [[San Marino]] suffered and the [[Mani Pulite|reformation of the Italian political class]] took place in the early 1990s.

The [[Politics of Europe|European political landscape]] changed drastically, with several former Eastern Bloc countries joining [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], resulting in stronger economic and social integration with Western Europe and the [[United States]].\n\n== Background ==\n=== Development of the Eastern Bloc ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n{{further|Eastern Bloc|List of socialist states}}\n[[Socialism]] had been gaining momentum among working class citizens of the world since the 19th century. These culminated in the early 20th century when several [[State (polity)|states]] and [[colonies]] formed their own [[communist parties]]. Many of the countries involved had [[hierarchical structure]]s with [[monarchic]] governments and [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] social structures with an established [[nobility]]. Socialism was undesirable within the circles of the [[ruling class]]es (which had begun to include industrial business leaders) in the late 19th/early 20th century states; as such, [[communism]] was repressed. Its champions suffered persecution while people were discouraged from adopting it. This had been the practice even in states which identified as exercising a multi-party system.\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 saw the first [[communist state]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), when the [[Bolsheviks]] overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]].\n\nDuring the period between the world wars, communism had been on the rise in many parts of the world, especially in towns and cities. This led to a series of purges in many countries to stifle the movement. Violent resistance to this repression led to an increase in support for communism in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn the early stages of [[World War II]], both Nazi Germany and the USSR invaded and occupied the countries of Eastern Europe after the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]. Germany then turned against and invaded the USSR: the battles of this [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] were the largest in history. The USSR joined with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and in conferences at [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]] and [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]], the Allies agreed that Central and Eastern Europe would be in the \"Soviet sphere of political influence.\". The USSR fought the Germans to a standstill and finally began driving them back, reaching Berlin before the end of the war. Nazi ideology was violently [[anti-communist]], and the Nazis brutally suppressed communist movements in the countries it occupied. Communists played a large part in the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance to the Nazis]] in these countries. As the Soviets forced the Germans back, they assumed temporary control of these devastated areas.\n\nAfter World War II, the Soviets ensured that communists loyal to Moscow took power in the countries it occupied. The Soviets retained troops throughout these territories. The [[Cold War]] saw these states, bound together by the [[Warsaw Pact]], have continuing tensions with the capitalist west, bound together by [[NATO]]. The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] established communism in [[China]] in 1949.\n\nDuring the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a spontaneous nationwide anti-authoritarian revolt, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary to assert control. Similarly, in 1968, the USSR repressed the [[Prague Spring]] by organizing the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].\n\n=== Emergence of Solidarity in Poland ===\n{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}\nLabour turmoil in Poland during 1980 led to the formation of the independent [[trade union]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], led by [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]], which over time became a political force. On 13 December 1981, Polish Prime Minister [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] started a crackdown on Solidarity by declaring [[martial law in Poland]], suspending the union, and temporarily imprisoning all of its leaders.\n\n=== Mikhail Gorbachev ===\n{{main|Mikhail Gorbachev|Perestroika|Glasnost|Democratization (Soviet Union)}}\nAlthough several Eastern Bloc countries had attempted some abortive, limited economic and political reform since the 1950s (e.g. the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and [[Prague Spring]] of 1968), the ascension of reform-minded Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in 1985 signaled the trend toward greater liberalization. During the mid-1980s, a younger generation of Soviet [[apparatchiks]], led by Gorbachev, began advocating fundamental reform in order to reverse years of [[Brezhnev stagnation]]. After decades of growth, the Soviet Union was now facing a period of severe economic decline and needed Western technology and credits{{clarify|date=March 2017}} to make up for its increasing backwardness. The costs of maintaining its military, the [[KGB]], and subsidies to foreign client states further strained the moribund [[Soviet economy]].\n\n[[File:Gorbachev and Reagan 1988-4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in Red Square, Moscow, 1988]]\nThe first signs of major reform came in 1986 when Gorbachev launched a policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) in the Soviet Union, and emphasized the need for ''[[perestroika]]'' (economic restructuring). By the spring of 1989, the Soviet Union had not only experienced lively media debate, but had also held its first multi-candidate elections in the newly established [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]]. While glasnost ostensibly advocated openness and political criticism, these were only permitted within a narrow spectrum dictated by the state. The general public in the Eastern Bloc was still subject to [[secret police]] and [[political repression]].\n\nGorbachev urged his Central and Southeast European counterparts to imitate ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost'' in their own countries. However, while reformists in Hungary and Poland were emboldened by the force of liberalization spreading from the east, other Eastern Bloc countries remained openly skeptical and demonstrated aversion to reform. Believing Gorbachev's reform initiatives would be short-lived, hardline communist rulers like [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], [[Communist Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]'s [[Todor Zhivkov]], [[Communist Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]]'s [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] and [[Communist Romania|Romania]]'s [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] obstinately ignored the calls for change.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://countrystudies.us/romania/75.htm | contribution = Romania \u2013 Soviet Union and Eastern Europe | place = US | publisher = Library of Congress | title = Country studies}}.</ref> \"When your neighbor puts up new wallpaper, it doesn't mean you have to too,\" declared one East German [[politburo]] member.<ref name=\"Steele\">{{Citation | last = Steele | first = Jonathan | title = Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev and the Mirage of Democracy | place = Boston | publisher = Faber | year = 1994}}.</ref>\n\n=== Soviet republics ===\n[[File:USSR Map timeline.gif|thumb|An animated series of maps showing the fall of the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the [[disintegration of the Soviet Union]], which later led to conflicts in the post-Soviet space]]\n\nBy the late 1980s, people in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Baltic states]] were demanding more autonomy from [[Moscow]], and the Kremlin was losing some of its control over certain regions and elements in the [[Soviet Union]]. In November 1988, the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] issued a [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|declaration of sovereignty]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-17/news/mn-458_1_soviet-union|title=Parliament in Estonia Declares 'Sovereignty'|work=latimes|date=17 November 1988}}</ref> which would eventually lead to other states making similar declarations of autonomy.\n\nThe [[Chernobyl disaster]] in April 1986 had major political and social effects that catalyzed or at least partially caused the revolutions of 1989. One political result of the disaster was the greatly increased significance of the new Soviet policy of [[glasnost]].<ref name=\"ShlyGlasnost\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00139157.1992.9931445 |title=Chernobyl andGlasnost: The Effects of Secrecy on Health and Safety |year=1992 |last1=Shlyakhter |first1=Alexander |last2=Wilson |first2=Richard |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=25}}</ref><ref name=\"PetrynaSarc\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/can.1995.10.2.02a00030 |title=Sarcophagus: Chernobyl in Historical Light |year=1995 |last1=Petryna |first1=Adriana |journal=Cultural Anthropology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=196\u2013220|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3baa4b94f69420e5289f466cc871ffa246e6ba6 }}</ref> It is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster.

However, by the late 1980s, Solidarity became sufficiently strong to frustrate [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski's]] attempts at reform, and [[1988 Polish strikes|nationwide strikes in 1988]] forced the government to open dialogue with Solidarity. On 9 March 1989, both sides agreed to a [[bicameral legislature]] called the [[National Assembly (Poland)|National Assembly]]. The already existing [[Sejm]] would become the lower house. The Senate would be elected by the people. Traditionally a ceremonial office, the presidency was given more powers<ref>[http://www.2facts.com Poland:Major Political Reform Agreed], ''Facts on File World News Digest'', 24 March 1989. Facts on File News Services. 6 September 2007</ref> ([[Polish Round Table Agreement]]).\n\nOn 7 July 1989, President Mikhail Gorbachev implicitly renounced the use of force against other Soviet-bloc nations. Speaking to members of the 23-nation Council of Europe, Mr. Gorbachev made no direct reference to the so-called [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], under which Moscow had asserted the right to use force to prevent a Warsaw Pact member from leaving the Communist fold. He stated, \"Any interference in domestic affairs and any attempts to restrict the sovereignty of states\u2014friends, allies or any others\u2014are inadmissible\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/07/world/gorbachev-spurns-the-use-of-force-in-eastern-europe.html?scp=714&sq=Hungary&st=nyt&gwh=8324637C96A56F9E0671EC017DB71D98 | work=The New York Times | first=James M. | last = Markham | title=Gorbachev spurns the use of force in Eastern Europe | date=7 July 1989}}</ref> The policy was termed the [[Sinatra Doctrine]], in a joking reference to the [[Frank Sinatra]] song \"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\". Poland became the first Warsaw Pact country to break free of Soviet domination.\n\n=== Regime changes outside of Eastern Europe ===\n{{see also|Third Wave Democracy}}\nIn February 1986, in one of the first peaceful, mass-movement revolutions against a dictatorship, the [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] peacefully overthrew dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and inaugurated [[Cory Aquino]] as president.\n\nThe [[domino effect]] of the revolutions of 1989 affected other regimes as well. The [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] regime and [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u20131990)|Pinochet's military dictatorship in Chile]] were gradually dismantled during the 1990s as the West withdrew their funding and diplomatic support. [[Argentina]], [[Ghana]], [[Indonesia]], [[Nicaragua]], [[South Korea]], [[Suriname]], [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), and [[North Yemen|North]] and [[South Yemen]], among many others, elected democratic governments.\n\nExact tallies of the number of democracies vary depending on the criteria used for assessment, but by some measures by the late 1990s there were well over 100 democracies in the world, a marked increase in just a few decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n== National political movements ==\n\n=== Poland ===\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u201389)#Final years of communist rule (1980\u201390)}}\n[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|Queue waiting to enter a store, a typical view in [[History of Poland (1945\u20131989)|Poland in the 1980s]]]]\n\nA [[1988 Polish strikes|wave of strikes]] hit Poland in April and May 1988. A second wave began on 15 August, when a strike broke out at the [[July Manifesto]] coal mine in [[Jastrz\u0119bie-Zdr\u00f3j]], with the workers demanding the re-legalisation of the Solidarity trade union. Over the next few days, sixteen other mines went on strike followed by a number of shipyards, including on 22 August the [[Gdansk Shipyard]], famous as the epicentre of the [[History of Solidarity|1980 industrial unrest]] that spawned Solidarity.{{Sfn | Wa\u0142\u0119sa | 1991 | p = 151}} On 31 August 1988 [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]], the leader of Solidarity, was invited to Warsaw by the Communist authorities, who had finally agreed to talks.{{Sfn | Wa\u0142\u0119sa | 1991 | p = 157}}\n\nOn 18 January 1989 at a stormy session of the Tenth Plenary Session of the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party|United Workers' Party]], General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], the First Secretary, managed to get party backing for formal negotiations with Solidarity leading to its future legalisation, although this was achieved only by threatening the resignation of the entire party leadership if thwarted.{{Sfn | Wa\u0142\u0119sa | 1991 | p = 174}} On 6 February 1989 formal Round Table discussions began in the Hall of Columns in Warsaw. On 4 April 1989 the historic [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Agreement]] was signed legalising Solidarity and setting up partly free [[1989 Polish legislative election|parliamentary elections]] to be held on 4 June 1989 (incidentally, the day following the midnight crackdown on Chinese protesters in Tiananmen Square). A political earthquake followed as the victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the [[Sejm]], while in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (with the one remaining seat taken by an independent candidate). At the same time, many prominent Communist candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them.\n\n[[File:Lech Walesa George H Bush.PNG|thumb|Solidarity Chairman [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] (center) with President [[George H.

By the end of September 1989, more than 30,000 East Germans had escaped to the West before the [[East Germany|GDR]] denied travel to Hungary, leaving [[Czechoslovakia]] as the only neighboring state to which East Germans could escape. Thousands of East Germans tried to reach the West by occupying the West German diplomatic facilities in other Central and Eastern European capitals, notably the [[Prague Embassy]] and the Hungarian Embassy, where thousands camped in the muddy garden from August to November waiting for German political reform. The GDR closed the border to Czechoslovakia on 3 October, thereby isolating itself from all its neighbors. Having been shut off from their last chance for escape, an increasing number of East Germans participated in the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] in Leipzig on 4, 11, and 18 September, each attracting 1,200 to 1,500 demonstrators. Many were arrested and beaten, but the people refused to be intimidated. On 25 September, the protests attracted 8,000 demonstrators.\n\nAfter the fifth successive Monday demonstration in Leipzig on 2 October attracted 10,000 protesters, [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) leader [[Erich Honecker]] issued a ''shoot and kill'' order to the military.<ref name = \"Pritchard\">{{cite book|title=Reconstructing education: East German schools and universities after unification| first = Rosalind MO | last = Pritchard|page =10}}</ref> Communists prepared a huge police, militia, [[Stasi]], and work-combat troop presence, and there were rumors a [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Square-style massacre]] was being planned for the following Monday's demonstration on 9 October.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Germany, 1918\u20132000: the divided nation| first =Mary | last = Fulbrook|page = 256}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 and 7 October, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] visited East Germany to mark the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, and urged the East German leadership to accept reform. A famous quote of his is rendered in German as \"Wer zu sp\u00e4t kommt, den bestraft das Leben\" (\"The one who comes too late is punished by life.\"). However, Honecker remained opposed to internal reform, with his regime even going so far as forbidding the circulation of Soviet publications that it viewed as subversive.\n\nIn spite of rumors that the Communists were planning a massacre on 9 October, 70,000 citizens demonstrated in Leipzig that Monday, and the authorities on the ground refused to open fire. This victory of the people facing down the Communists' guns encouraged more citizens to take to the streets. The following Monday, 16 October 120,000 people demonstrated on the streets of Leipzig.\n\nErich Honecker had hoped that the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet troops]] stationed in the GDR by the [[Warsaw Pact]] would restore the communist government and suppress the civilian protests. By 1989 the Soviet government deemed it impractical for the Soviet Union to [[Sinatra Doctrine|continue asserting its control]] over the Eastern Bloc, so it took a neutral stance regarding the events happening in East Germany. Soviet troops stationed in eastern Europe were under strict instructions from the Soviet leadership not to intervene in the political affairs of the Eastern Bloc nations and remained in their barracks. Faced with ongoing civil unrest, the SED deposed Honecker on 18 October and replaced him with the number-two-man in the regime, [[Egon Krenz]]. However, the demonstrations kept growing, and on Monday, 23 October, the Leipzig protesters numbered 300,000 and remained as large the following week.\n\nThe border to Czechoslovakia was opened again on 1 November, and the Czechoslovak authorities soon let all East Germans travel directly to West Germany without further bureaucratic ado, thus lifting their part of the Iron Curtain on 3 November. On 4 November the authorities decided to authorize a demonstration in Berlin and were faced with the [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]], where half a million citizens converged on the capital demanding freedom in the biggest protest the GDR ever witnessed. Unable to stem the ensuing flow of refugees to the West through Czechoslovakia, the East German authorities eventually caved in to public pressure by allowing East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany directly, via existing border points, on 9 November 1989, without having properly briefed the border guards. Triggered by the erratic words of regime spokesman [[G\u00fcnter Schabowski]] in a TV press conference, stating that the planned changes were in effect \"immediately, without delay,\" hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of the opportunity. The guards were quickly overwhelmed by the growing crowds of people demanding to be let out into West Berlin. After receiving no feedback from their superiors, the guards, unwilling to use force, relented and [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|opened the gates]] to West Berlin. Soon new crossing points were forced open in the [[Berlin Wall]] by the people, and sections of the wall were literally torn down as this symbol of oppression was overwhelmed. The bewildered guards were unaware of what was happening and meekly stood by as the East Germans took to the wall with hammers and chisels.\n\n[[File: RIAN archive 428452 Germany becomes one country.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin Wall, October 1990, Saying \"Thank You, [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbi]]\"]]\n\nOn 7 November, the entire ''Ministerrat der DDR'' ([[State Council of East Germany]]), including its chairman [[Willi Stoph]], resigned.<ref>[[:de:Ministerrat der DDR (1986\u20131989)]] contains all the members of the Council.</ref> A new government was formed under a considerably more liberal Communist, [[Hans Modrow]].<ref>see also [[:de:Regierung Modrow]]</ref>\nOn 1 December, the [[Volkskammer]] removed the SED's leading role from the [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|constitution of the GDR]]. \nOn 3 December Krenz resigned as leader of the SED; he resigned as head of state three days later. On 7 December, Round Table talks opened between the SED and other political parties. On 16 December 1989, the SED was dissolved and refounded as the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|SED-PDS]], abandoning Marxism-Leninism and becoming a mainstream democratic socialist party.\n\nOn 15 January 1990, the Stasi's headquarters was stormed by protesters. Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany until [[1990 East German general election|free elections were held on 18 March 1990]]\u2014the first [[November 1932 German federal election|since November 1932]]. The SED, renamed the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]], was heavily defeated. [[Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|East German Christian Democratic Union]] became Prime Minister on 4 April 1990 on a platform of speedy [[German reunification|reunification]] with the West. The two Germanies were reunified on 3 October 1990.\n\nThe [[Government of the Soviet Union|Kremlin's]] willingness to abandon such a strategically vital ally marked a dramatic change by the Soviet superpower and a fundamental [[paradigm shift]] in [[international relations]], which until 1989 had been dominated by the East\u2013West divide running through Berlin itself. The last [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Russian troops]] left the territory of the former GDR, now part of a reunited [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], on 1 September 1994.\n\n=== Czechoslovakia ===\n{{main|Velvet Revolution}}\n[[File:Prague November89 - Wenceslas Monument.jpg|thumb|Protests beneath the monument in [[Wenceslas Square]], in [[Prague]]]]\n[[File:Bratislava Slovakia 213.JPG|thumb|upright|Memorial of the [[Velvet Revolution]] in [[Bratislava]] ([[SNP Square (Bratislava)|N\u00e1mestie SNP]]), [[Slovakia]]]]\n\nThe \"Velvet Revolution\" was a non-violent transition of power in Czechoslovakia from the Communist government to a parliamentary republic. On 17 November 1989, riot police suppressed a peaceful student demonstration in Prague, although controversy continues over whether anyone died that night. That event sparked a series of popular demonstrations from 19 November to late December. By 20 November the number of peaceful protesters assembled in Prague had swelled from 200,000 the previous day to an estimated half-million. Five days later, the Letn\u00e1 Square protest held 800,000 people.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.denik.cz/z_domova/demonstrace-na-letne-pred-25-lety-urychlily-kapitulaci-komunistu-20141123.html | title = Demonstrace na letne pred 25 lety urychlily kapitulaci komunistu | language = cs| place = [[Czhec|CZ]] | newspaper = Denik| date = 23 November 2014 }}.</ref> On 24 November, the entire Communist Party leadership, including general secretary [[Milo\u0161 Jake\u0161]], resigned. A two-hour general strike, involving all citizens of Czechoslovakia, was successfully held on 27 November.\n\nWith the collapse of other Communist governments, and increasing street protests, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia announced on 28 November 1989 that it would relinquish power and dismantle the single-party state. Barbed wire and other obstructions were removed from the border with West Germany and Austria in early December. On 10 December, President [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] appointed the first largely non-Communist government in Czechoslovakia since 1948, and resigned. [[Alexander Dub\u010dek]] was elected speaker of the federal parliament on 28 December and [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] the President of Czechoslovakia on 29 December 1989. In June 1990 Czechoslovakia held its first democratic elections since 1946. On 27 June 1991 the last Soviet troops were withdrawn from Czechoslovakia.<ref>{{cite news| title=20 Years After Soviet Soldiers Left the Czech Republic, Russians Move In|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2011/06/28/soviet-soldiers-left-czechoslovakia-20-years-ago-ordinary-well-off-russians-to-move-in/ | newspaper= The Wall Street Journal|date=28 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\nIn October and November 1989, demonstrations on ecological issues were staged in Sofia, where demands for political reform were also voiced. The demonstrations were suppressed, but on 10 November 1989 (the day after the Berlin Wall was breached) Bulgaria's long-serving leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] was ousted by his Politburo. He was succeeded by a considerably more liberal Communist, former foreign minister [[Petar Mladenov]]. Moscow apparently approved the leadership change, as Zhivkov had been opposed to Gorbachev's policies. The new regime immediately repealed restrictions on free speech and assembly, which led to the first mass demonstration on 17 November, as well as the formation of anti-communist movements. Nine of them united as the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (UDF) on 7 December.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.sds.bg/about/history | title = History of the UDF | language = bg | publisher = SDS | place = [[Bulgaria|BG]]}}</ref> The UDF was not satisfied with Zhivkov's ouster, and demanded additional democratic reforms, most importantly the removal of the constitutionally mandated leading role of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]].\n\nMladenov announced on 11 December 1989 that the Communist Party would abandon its monopoly on power, and that multiparty elections would be held the following year. In February 1990, the Bulgarian legislature deleted the portion of the constitution about the \"leading role\" of the Communist Party. Eventually, it was decided that a round table on the Polish model would be held in 1990 and elections held by June 1990. The round table took place from 3 January to 14 May 1990, at which an agreement was reached on the transition to democracy. The Communist Party abandoned Marxism\u2013Leninism in April 1990 and renamed itself as the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]. In June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held, won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party.\n\n=== Romania ===\n{{main|Romanian Revolution}}\nAfter having suppressed the [[Bra\u015fov Rebellion]] in 1987, [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] was re-elected for another five years as leader of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) in November 1989, signalling that he intended to ride out the anti-Communist uprisings sweeping the rest of Europe. As Ceau\u015fescu prepared to go on a state visit to Iran, his [[Securitate]] ordered the arrest and exile of a local Hungarian [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] minister, [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u0151k\u00e9s]], on 16 December, for sermons offending the regime. T\u0151k\u00e9s was seized, but only after serious rioting erupted. [[Timi\u0219oara]] was the first city to react on 16 December and civil unrest continued for five days.\n\n[[File:Civilian with PM Md. 1963 during the Romanian Revolution of 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Armed civilians during the [[Romanian Revolution]]. The revolution was the only violent overthrow of a [[Communist state]] in the [[Warsaw Pact]].]]\n\nReturning from Iran, Ceau\u015fescu ordered a mass rally in his support outside Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest on 21 December. However, to his shock the crowd booed and jeered him as he spoke. Years of repressed dissatisfaction boiled to the surface throughout the Romanian populace and even among elements in Ceau\u015fescu's own government, and the demonstrations spread throughout the country.\n\nAt first the security forces obeyed Ceau\u015fescu's orders to shoot protesters. However, on the morning of 22 December, the Romanian military suddenly changed sides. This came after it was announced that defense minister [[Vasile Milea]] had committed suicide after being unmasked as a traitor. Believing Milea had actually been murdered, the rank-and-file soldiers went over virtually ''en masse'' to the revolution.<ref>{{cite publication|last=Cornel|first=Ban|title=Sovereign Debt, Austerity, and Regime Change: The Case of Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania|date=13 December 2012|publisher=East European Politics & Societies|page=34|doi=10.1177/0888325412465513}}</ref> Army tanks began moving towards the Central Committee building with crowds swarming alongside them. The rioters forced open the doors of the Central Committee building in an attempt to capture Ceau\u015fescu and his wife, [[Elena Ceau\u015fescu|Elena]], coming within a few meters of the couple. However, they managed to escape via a helicopter waiting for them on the roof of the building.\n\nAlthough elation followed the flight of the Ceau\u015fescus, uncertainty surrounded their fate. On Christmas Day, Romanian television showed the Ceau\u015fescus facing a hasty trial, and then being executed by firing squad. An interim [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] Council led by [[Ion Iliescu]] took over and announced elections for April 1990, the first free elections held in Romania since 1937. These were, however, postponed until 20 May 1990. The Romanian Revolution was the bloodiest of the revolutions of 1989: over 1,000 people died, one hundred of which were children, the youngest only one month old. Unlike its kindred parties in the Warsaw Pact, the PCR simply melted away; no present-day Romanian party claiming to be its successor has ever been elected to the legislature since the change of system. However, former PCR members have played significant roles in post-1989 Romanian politics; every [[Romanian President]] until the election of [[Klaus Iohannis]] in [[2014 Romanian presidential election|2014]] was a former Communist Party member.\n\n=== Yugoslavia ===\n{{main|Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Wars}}\nThe [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was not a part of the Warsaw Pact but pursued [[Titoism|its own version]] of Communism under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. It was a multi-ethnic state which Tito was able to maintain through a [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav patriotic doctrine]] of \"[[Brotherhood and unity]]\". Tensions between ethnicities began to escalate, however, with the [[Croatian Spring]] of 1970\u201371, a movement for greater [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]]n autonomy, which was suppressed. Constitutional changes were instituted in 1974, and the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] devolved some federal powers to the constituent republics and provinces. After Tito's death in 1980 ethnic tensions grew, first in Albanian-majority [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|SAP Kosovo]] with the [[1981 protests in Kosovo]].\n\nParallel to the same process, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] initiated a policy of gradual liberalization in 1984, somewhat similar to the Soviet Perestroika. This provoked tensions between the [[League of Communists of Slovenia]] and the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|central Yugoslav Party]] and [[Yugoslav People's Army|federal army]]. In 1984 the decade long ban to build the [[Church of Saint Sava|Saint Sava Cahedral]] in [[Belgrade]] was lifted, the backdown of the communist elite and a popular gathering of 100.000 believers on 12 May 1985 to celebrate liturgy inside the walls of the ruins marked the return of religion in postwar Yugoslavia.<ref>Dunja Predi\u0107 2012: How big is all that, really?

In 1987 and 1988, a series of clashes between the emerging civil society and the Communist regime culminated with the so-called [[Slovene Spring]], a mass movement for democratic reforms. The [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]] was established as the platform of all major non-Communist political movements. By early 1989, several anti-Communist political parties were already openly functioning, challenging the hegemony of the Slovenian Communists. Soon, the Slovenian Communists, pressured by their own civil society, came into conflict with the [[League of Communists of Serbia|Serbian Communist]] leadership.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:Yugoslavia ethnic map.jpg|thumb|[[Ethnic groups in Yugoslavia]] in 1991]]\n\nIn January 1990, an extraordinary Congress of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] was called in order to settle the disputes among its constituent parties. Faced with being completely outnumbered, the Slovenian and [[League of Communists of Croatia|Croatian]] Communists walked out of the Congress on 23 January 1990, thus effectively bringing to an end to Yugoslavia's communist party. Both parties of the two western republics negotiated free multi-party elections with their own opposition movements.\n\nOn 8 April 1990, the democratic and anti-Yugoslav [[DEMOS coalition]] won the [[1990 Slovenian parliamentary election|elections in Slovenia]], while on 22 April 1990 the [[1990 Croatian parliamentary election|Croatian elections]] resulted in a landslide victory for the nationalist [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) led by [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]]. The results were much more balanced [[1990 Bosnia and Herzegovina parliamentary election|in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[1990 Macedonian parliamentary election|in Macedonia]] in November 1990, while the [[1990 Serbian parliamentary election|parliamentary]] and [[1990 Serbian presidential election|presidential]] elections of December 1990 in Serbia and [[1990 Montenegrin parliamentary election|Montenegro]] consolidated the power of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and his supporters. Free elections on the level of the federation were never carried out.\n\nThe Slovenian and Croatian leaderships started preparing plans for secession from the federation, while a part of the [[Serbs of Croatia]] started the so-called [[Log Revolution]], an insurrection organized by [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]] that would lead to the creation of the breakaway region of [[SAO Krajina]]. In the [[1990 Slovenian independence referendum|Slovenian independence referendum]] on 23 December 1990, 88.5% of residents voted for independence.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |publisher=Sussex |place=UK |title=Slovenian Referendum Briefing No. 3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218000730/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |archivedate=18 December 2010 }}</ref> In the [[1991 Croatian independence referendum|Croatian independence referendum]] on 19 May 1991, 93.24% voted for independence.\n\nThe escalating ethnic and national tensions were exacerbated by the drive for independence and led to the following [[Yugoslav wars]]:\n* [[Ten-Day War|War in Slovenia]] (1991)\n* [[Croatian War of Independence]] (1991\u20131995)\n* [[Bosnian War]] (1992\u20131995)\n* [[Kosovo War]] (1998\u20131999), including the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].\n\nIn addition, the [[insurgency in the Pre\u0161evo Valley]] (1999\u20132001) and the [[insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia]] (2001) are also often discussed in the same context.{{Sfn | Judah |  2011}}{{Sfn | Naimark | Case | 2003 | p = xvii}}{{Sfn | Rogel | 2004 | pp = 91\u201392}}\n\n=== Albania ===\n{{main|Fall of communism in Albania}} <!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Fall of Communism in Albania.JPG|thumb|left|The fall of Enver Hoxha's Statue in central Tirana on 11 December 1990]] -->\nIn the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], [[Enver Hoxha]], who led Albania for four decades, died on 11 April 1985.

Eventually, the existing regime introduced some liberalization, including measures in 1990 providing for freedom to travel abroad. Efforts were begun to improve ties with the outside world. March 1991 elections\u2014the first free elections in Albania since 1923, and only the third free elections in the country's history\u2014left the former Communists in power, but a general strike and urban opposition led to the formation of a coalition cabinet including non-Communists.

The students called for campus elections, the chance to study abroad and greater availability of Western pop culture. Their protests took advantage of the loosening political atmosphere and included rallies against the slow pace of reform. [[Hu Yaobang]], a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Deng Xiaoping and a leading advocate of reform, was blamed for the protests and forced to resign as the CCP general secretary in January 1987. In the \"Anti Bourgeois Liberalization Campaign\", Hu would be further denounced.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square protests were sparked by the death of Hu Yaobang on 15 April 1989. By the eve of Hu's state funeral, some 100,000 students had gathered at [[Tiananmen Square]] to observe it; however, no leaders emerged from the [[Great Hall of the People|Great Hall]]. The movement lasted for seven weeks.<ref name= \"Zhao153\">{{Citation | first = Dingxin | last = Zhao | title = The Power of Tiananmen: State-Society Relations and the 1989 Beijing Student Movement | place = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-226-98260-2 | page = 153}}.</ref>\n\nMikhail Gorbachev visited China on 15 May during the protests, bringing many foreign news agencies to Beijing, and their sympathetic portrayals of the protesters helped galvanize a spirit of liberation among the Central, South-East and Eastern Europeans who were watching. The Chinese leadership, particularly Communist Party general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]], who had begun to radically reform the economy earlier than the Soviets, was open to political reform, but not at the cost of a potential return to the disorder of the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\nThe movement lasted from Hu's death on 15 April until tanks and troops rolled into Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989. In Beijing, the military response to the protest by the PRC government left many civilians in charge of clearing the square of the dead and severely injured. The exact number of casualties is not known and many different estimates exist. The event, however, did make some political change; the most notable being that [[China]] started to open up its economy. This allowed for the country to bring in large sums of money and also started the wave of mass migration from rural Western China to urban Eastern China. The problem with the mass migration is that it has now started a deepening divide between the rural poor and the rich urban people.<ref>{{Citation|title=FRONTLINE {{!}} The Tank Man {{!}} Season 2006 {{!}} Episode 8|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/frontline-the-tank-man/|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>\n\n== Malta Summit ==\n[[File:Bush and Gorbachev at the Malta summit in 1989.gif|thumb|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and President [[George H.

At a summit later that same month, Gorbachev and Bush declared a US\u2013Soviet strategic partnership, decisively marking the end of the Cold War. President Bush declared that US\u2013Soviet cooperation during the 1990\u20131991 [[Gulf War]] had laid the groundwork for a partnership in resolving bilateral and world problems.\n\nAs the Soviet Union rapidly withdrew its forces from Central and Southeast Europe, the spillover from the 1989 upheavals began reverberating throughout the Soviet Union itself. Agitation for self-determination led to first Lithuania, and then Estonia, Latvia and Armenia declaring independence. However, the Soviet central government demanded the revocation of the declarations and threatened military action and economic sanctions. The government even went as far as controversially sending [[Soviet Army]] troops to the streets of the Lithuanian capital, [[Vilnius]], to [[January Events (Lithuania)|suppress the separatist movements]] in January 1991, causing the deaths of 14 people.\n\nDisaffection in other Soviet republics, such as Georgia and Azerbaijan, was countered by promises of greater decentralization. More open elections led to the election of candidates opposed to Communist Party rule.\n\n''Glasnost'' had inadvertently released the long-suppressed national sentiments of all peoples within the borders of the multinational Soviet state. These nationalist movements were further strengthened by the rapid deterioration of the Soviet economy, whose ramshackle foundations were exposed with the removal of Communist discipline. Gorbachev's reforms had failed to improve the economy, with the old Soviet [[planned economy|command structure]] completely breaking down. One by one, the constituent republics created their own economic systems and voted to subordinate Soviet laws to local laws. In 1990, the Communist Party was forced to surrender its seven-decade monopoly of political power when the Supreme Soviet rescinded the clause in the Soviet Constitution that guaranteed its sole authority to rule. Gorbachev's policies caused the Communist Party to lose its grip over the media. Details of the Soviet Union's past were quickly being declassified. This caused many to distrust the 'old system' and push for greater autonomy and independence.\n\n[[File:Image0 ST.jpg|thumb|left|Tanks in Moscow's [[Red Square]] during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|1991 coup attempt]]]]\n\nAfter a referendum confirmed the preservation of the Soviet Union but in a looser form, a group of Soviet hard-liners represented by Vice-President [[Gennadi Yanayev]] launched [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|a coup attempting to overthrow Gorbachev]] in August 1991. [[Boris Yeltsin]], then president of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], rallied the people and much of the army against the coup and the effort collapsed. Although restored to power, Gorbachev's authority had been irreparably undermined. Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party following the coup, and the Supreme Soviet dissolved the Party and banned all Communist activity on Soviet soil. Just a few weeks later, the government granted the Baltic states their independence on 6 September.\n\nOver the next three months, one republic after another declared independence, mostly out of fear of another coup. Also during this time, the Soviet government was rendered useless as the new Russian government began taking over what remained of it, including the Kremlin. The penultimate step came on 1 December, when voters in the second most powerful republic, Ukraine, overwhelmingly voted to secede from the Soviet Union in a referendum. This ended any realistic chance of keeping the Soviet Union together. On 8 December, Yeltsin met with his counterparts from Ukraine and Belarus and signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], declaring that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. Gorbachev denounced this as illegal, but he had long since lost any ability to influence events outside of Moscow.\n\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|Changes in national boundaries after the end of the [[Cold War]]]]\n\nTwo weeks later, 11 of the remaining 12 republics\u2014all except Georgia\u2014signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], which confirmed the Soviet Union had been effectively dissolved and replaced by a new voluntary association, the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Bowing to the inevitable, Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president on 25 December, and the Supreme Soviet ratified the Belavezha Accords the next day, legally dissolving itself and the Soviet Union as a political entity. By the end of 1991, the few Soviet institutions that hadn't been taken over by Russia had dissolved. The Soviet Union was officially disbanded, breaking up into fifteen constituent parts, thereby ending the world's largest and most influential Socialist state, and leaving to China that position. A [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] dissolved into violence in Moscow as the [[Russian Army]] was called in to reestablish order.\n\n=== Baltic states ===\n{{main|Singing Revolution}}\n[[File:1989 08 23 Baltijoskelias14.jpg|thumb|[[Baltic Way]] was a [[Human chain (politics)|human chain]] of approximately two million people dedicated to liberating the [[Baltic Republics]] from the [[Soviet Union]].]]\n\nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania implemented democratic reforms and achieved independence from the Soviet Union.

These declarations were met with force from the Soviet Union in early 1991, in confrontations known as the [[January Events (Lithuania)|\"January Events\" in Lithuania]] and \"[[The Barricades]]\" in Latvia. The Baltic states contended that their incorporation into the Soviet Union had been illegal under both international law and their own law, and they were reasserting an independence that still legally existed.\n\nSoon after the launching of the August coup, Estonia and Latvia declared full independence. By the time the coup was foiled, the USSR was no longer unified enough to mount a forceful resistance, and it recognized the independence of the Baltic states on 6 September.\n\n=== Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova ===\n* {{flag|Belarus|1991}} declared full independence from the USSR on 25 August 1991. The main political changes of the early 1990s were driven by the [[Belarusian Popular Front]] and its fraction in the [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus]]. A few years later, a new post-communist leader, [[Alexander Lukashenko|Alyaksandr Lukashenka]], obtained power. After a short period, he increased his power as a result of two controversial referendums (1995\u201396) and has been criticized for [[Human rights in Belarus|repressing political opposition]] ever since.\n* {{flag|Moldova}} participated in the [[War of Transnistria]] between Moldova and Russian-connected forces in the separatist region of [[Transnistria]].

After Kocharyan, notably, [[Serzh Sargsyan]] ascended to power. Sargsyan is often noted as the \"founder of the Armenian and Karabakh militaries\" and was, in the past, defense minister and national security minister.\n* {{flag|Azerbaijan}}'s [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party|Popular Front Party]] won the first elections with the self-described pro-Western, populist nationalist Elchibey. However, Elchibey planned to end Moscow's advantage in the harvesting of Azeri oil and build much stronger links with Turkey and Europe, and as a result was overthrown by former Communists in a coup backed by Russia and Iran (which viewed the new country as a compelling threat, with territorial ambitions within Iranian borders and also being a strong economic rival).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Glenn E.|title=Azerbaijan: A Country Study|date=1995}}</ref> Mutallibov rose to power, but he was soon destabilized and eventually ousted due to popular frustration with his perceived incompetence, corruption and improper handling of the war with Armenia.

Dudayev was elected in a landslide in the following election and in November 1991 he proclaimed [[Checheno-Ingushetia]]'s independence as the Republic of Ichkeria. Ingushetia voted to leave the union with Chechnya, and was allowed to do so (thus it became the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria). Due to Dudayev's desire to exclude Moscow from all oil deals, Yeltsin backed a failed coup against him in 1993. In 1994, Chechnya, with only marginal recognition (one country: Georgia, which was revoked soon after the coup landing Shevardnadze in power), was invaded by Russia, spurring the [[First Chechen War]]. The Chechens, with considerable assistance from the populations of both former-Soviet countries and from Sunni Muslim countries repelled this invasion and a peace treaty was signed in 1997. However, Chechnya became increasingly anarchic, largely due to the both political and physical destruction of the state during the invasion, and general Shamil Basaev, having evaded all control by the central government, conducted raids into neighboring Dagestan, which Russia used as pretext for reinvading Ichkeria.

To prepare for his testimony, Bukovsky requested and was granted access to a large number of documents from Soviet archives (then reorganized into [[TsKhSD]]).

It may not be called Communism anymore, but it retained many of its dangerous characteristics...

Even the isolationist Stalinist regime in Albania was unable to stem the tide. Gorbachev's abrogation of the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] was perhaps the key factor that enabled the popular uprisings to succeed. Once it became evident that the feared Soviet Army would not intervene to crush dissent, the Central, South-East and Eastern European regimes were exposed as vulnerable in the face of popular uprisings against the one-party system and power of [[secret police]].\n\n[[Coit D.

Rather, Gorbachev assumed that the Communist parties of Central and South-East Europe could be reformed in a similar way to the reforms he hoped to achieve in the CPSU. Just as ''perestroika'' was aimed at making the Soviet Union more efficient economically and politically, Gorbachev believed that the [[Comecon]] and Warsaw Pact could be reformed into more effective entities. However, [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], a close advisor to Gorbachev, would later state that it would have been \"absurd to keep the system\" in Central and South-East Europe. Yakovlev had come to the conclusion that the Soviet-dominated Comecon could not work on non-market principles and that the Warsaw Pact had \"no relevance to real life\".<ref>{{citation|author=Steele,

On 4 June 1989, the trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] won an overwhelming victory in a [[1989 Polish legislative election|partially free election in Poland]], leading to the peaceful [[Fall of communism in Poland|fall of Communism in that country]] in the summer of 1989. Also in June 1989, Hungary began dismantling its section of the physical [[Iron Curtain]], leading to an exodus of East Germans through Hungary, which destabilized East Germany. This led to [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations]] in cities such as [[Leipzig]] and subsequently to the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in November 1989, which served as the symbolic gateway to [[German reunification]] in 1990.\n\nThe [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] in December 1991, resulting in eleven new countries ([[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Moldova]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Uzbekistan]]), which had declared their independence from the Soviet Union in the course of the year, while the [[Baltic states]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]) [[Occupation of the Baltic states|regained]] their independence by September 1991. The rest of the Soviet Union, which constituted the bulk of the area, continued with the establishment of the [[Russian Federation]] in December 1991. [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] abandoned Communism between 1990 and 1992. By 1992, Yugoslavia had [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|split into five successor states]], namely [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[North Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Slovenia]] and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was later renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003 and [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|eventually split in 2006]] into two states, [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. Serbia was then further split with the breakaway of the [[International recognition of Kosovo|partially recognized]] state of [[Kosovo]] in 2008.

Many communist and socialist organisations in the West turned their guiding principles over to [[social democracy]] and [[democratic socialism]]. Communist parties in [[Italy]] and [[San Marino]] suffered and the [[Mani Pulite|reformation of the Italian political class]] took place in the early 1990s. In [[South America]], the [[Pink tide]] began with [[Venezuela]] in 1999 and swept through the early 2000s. The [[Politics of Europe|European political landscape]] changed drastically, with several former Eastern Bloc countries joining [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], resulting in stronger economic and social integration with Western Europe and the [[United States]].\n\n== Background ==\n=== Development of the Eastern Bloc ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n{{further|Eastern Bloc|List of socialist states}}\n[[Socialism]] had been gaining momentum among working class citizens of the world since the 19th century. These culminated in the early 20th century when several [[State (polity)|states]] and [[colonies]] formed their own [[communist parties]]. Many of the countries involved had [[hierarchical structure]]s with [[monarchic]] governments and [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] social structures with an established [[nobility]]. Socialism was undesirable within the circles of the [[ruling class]]es (which had begun to include industrial business leaders) in the late 19th/early 20th century states; as such, [[communism]] was repressed. Its champions suffered persecution while people were discouraged from adopting it. This had been the practice even in states which identified as exercising a multi-party system.\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 saw the first [[communist state]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), when the [[Bolsheviks]] overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]].\n\nDuring the period between the world wars, communism had been on the rise in many parts of the world, especially in towns and cities. This led to a series of purges in many countries to stifle the movement. Violent resistance to this repression led to an increase in support for communism in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn the early stages of [[World War II]], both Nazi Germany and the USSR invaded and occupied the countries of Eastern Europe after the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]. Germany then turned against and invaded the USSR: the battles of this [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] were the largest in history. The USSR joined with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and in conferences at [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]] and [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]], the Allies agreed that Central and Eastern Europe would be in the \"Soviet sphere of political influence.\". The USSR fought the Germans to a standstill and finally began driving them back, reaching Berlin before the end of the war. Nazi ideology was violently [[anti-communist]], and the Nazis brutally suppressed communist movements in the countries it occupied. Communists played a large part in the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance to the Nazis]] in these countries. As the Soviets forced the Germans back, they assumed temporary control of these devastated areas.\n\nAfter World War II, the Soviets ensured that communists loyal to Moscow took power in the countries it occupied. The Soviets retained troops throughout these territories. The [[Cold War]] saw these states, bound together by the [[Warsaw Pact]], have continuing tensions with the capitalist west, bound together by [[NATO]]. The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] established communism in [[China]] in 1949.\n\nDuring the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a spontaneous nationwide anti-authoritarian revolt, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary to assert control. Similarly, in 1968, the USSR repressed the [[Prague Spring]] by organizing the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].\n\n=== Emergence of Solidarity in Poland ===\n{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}\nLabour turmoil in Poland during 1980 led to the formation of the independent [[trade union]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], led by [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]], which over time became a political force. On 13 December 1981, Polish Prime Minister [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] started a crackdown on Solidarity by declaring [[martial law in Poland]], suspending the union, and temporarily imprisoning all of its leaders.\n\n=== Mikhail Gorbachev ===\n{{main|Mikhail Gorbachev|Perestroika|Glasnost|Democratization (Soviet Union)}}\nAlthough several Eastern Bloc countries had attempted some abortive, limited economic and political reform since the 1950s (e.g. the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and [[Prague Spring]] of 1968), the ascension of reform-minded Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in 1985 signaled the trend toward greater liberalization. During the mid-1980s, a younger generation of Soviet [[apparatchiks]], led by Gorbachev, began advocating fundamental reform in order to reverse years of [[Brezhnev stagnation]]. After decades of growth, the Soviet Union was now facing a period of severe economic decline and needed Western technology and credits{{clarify|date=March 2017}} to make up for its increasing backwardness. The costs of maintaining its military, the [[KGB]], and subsidies to foreign client states further strained the moribund [[Soviet economy]].\n\n[[File:Gorbachev and Reagan 1988-4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in Red Square, Moscow, 1988]]\nThe first signs of major reform came in 1986 when Gorbachev launched a policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) in the Soviet Union, and emphasized the need for ''[[perestroika]]'' (economic restructuring). By the spring of 1989, the Soviet Union had not only experienced lively media debate, but had also held its first multi-candidate elections in the newly established [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]]. While glasnost ostensibly advocated openness and political criticism, these were only permitted within a narrow spectrum dictated by the state. The general public in the Eastern Bloc was still subject to [[secret police]] and [[political repression]].\n\nGorbachev urged his Central and Southeast European counterparts to imitate ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost'' in their own countries. However, while reformists in Hungary and Poland were emboldened by the force of liberalization spreading from the east, other Eastern Bloc countries remained openly skeptical and demonstrated aversion to reform. Believing Gorbachev's reform initiatives would be short-lived, hardline communist rulers like [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], [[Communist Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]'s [[Todor Zhivkov]], [[Communist Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]]'s [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] and [[Communist Romania|Romania]]'s [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] obstinately ignored the calls for change.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://countrystudies.us/romania/75.htm | contribution = Romania \u2013 Soviet Union and Eastern Europe | place = US | publisher = Library of Congress | title = Country studies}}.</ref> \"When your neighbor puts up new wallpaper, it doesn't mean you have to too,\" declared one East German [[politburo]] member.<ref name=\"Steele\">{{Citation | last = Steele | first = Jonathan | title = Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev and the Mirage of Democracy | place = Boston | publisher = Faber | year = 1994}}.</ref>\n\n=== Soviet republics ===\n[[File:USSR Map timeline.gif|thumb|An animated series of maps showing the fall of the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the [[disintegration of the Soviet Union]], which later led to conflicts in the post-Soviet space]]\n\nBy the late 1980s, people in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Baltic states]] were demanding more autonomy from [[Moscow]], and the Kremlin was losing some of its control over certain regions and elements in the [[Soviet Union]]. In November 1988, the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] issued a [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|declaration of sovereignty]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-17/news/mn-458_1_soviet-union|title=Parliament in Estonia Declares 'Sovereignty'|work=latimes|date=17 November 1988}}</ref> which would eventually lead to other states making similar declarations of autonomy.\n\nThe [[Chernobyl disaster]] in April 1986 had major political and social effects that catalyzed or at least partially caused the revolutions of 1989. One political result of the disaster was the greatly increased significance of the new Soviet policy of [[glasnost]].<ref name=\"ShlyGlasnost\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00139157.1992.9931445 |title=Chernobyl andGlasnost: The Effects of Secrecy on Health and Safety |year=1992 |last1=Shlyakhter |first1=Alexander |last2=Wilson |first2=Richard |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=25}}</ref><ref name=\"PetrynaSarc\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/can.1995.10.2.02a00030 |title=Sarcophagus: Chernobyl in Historical Light |year=1995 |last1=Petryna |first1=Adriana |journal=Cultural Anthropology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=196\u2013220|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3baa4b94f69420e5289f466cc871ffa246e6ba6 }}</ref> It is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster.

However, by the late 1980s, Solidarity became sufficiently strong to frustrate [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski's]] attempts at reform, and [[1988 Polish strikes|nationwide strikes in 1988]] forced the government to open dialogue with Solidarity. On 9 March 1989, both sides agreed to a [[bicameral legislature]] called the [[National Assembly (Poland)|National Assembly]]. The already existing [[Sejm]] would become the lower house. The Senate would be elected by the people. Traditionally a ceremonial office, the presidency was given more powers<ref>[http://www.2facts.com Poland:Major Political Reform Agreed], ''Facts on File World News Digest'', 24 March 1989. Facts on File News Services. 6 September 2007</ref> ([[Polish Round Table Agreement]]).\n\nOn 7 July 1989, President Mikhail Gorbachev implicitly renounced the use of force against other Soviet-bloc nations. Speaking to members of the 23-nation Council of Europe, Mr. Gorbachev made no direct reference to the so-called [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], under which Moscow had asserted the right to use force to prevent a Warsaw Pact member from leaving the Communist fold. He stated, \"Any interference in domestic affairs and any attempts to restrict the sovereignty of states\u2014friends, allies or any others\u2014are inadmissible\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/07/world/gorbachev-spurns-the-use-of-force-in-eastern-europe.html?scp=714&sq=Hungary&st=nyt&gwh=8324637C96A56F9E0671EC017DB71D98 | work=The New York Times | first=James M. | last = Markham | title=Gorbachev spurns the use of force in Eastern Europe | date=7 July 1989}}</ref> The policy was termed the [[Sinatra Doctrine]], in a joking reference to the [[Frank Sinatra]] song \"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\".

By the end of September 1989, more than 30,000 East Germans had escaped to the West before the [[East Germany|GDR]] denied travel to Hungary, leaving [[Czechoslovakia]] as the only neighboring state to which East Germans could escape. Thousands of East Germans tried to reach the West by occupying the West German diplomatic facilities in other Central and Eastern European capitals, notably the [[Prague Embassy]] and the Hungarian Embassy, where thousands camped in the muddy garden from August to November waiting for German political reform. The GDR closed the border to Czechoslovakia on 3 October, thereby isolating itself from all its neighbors. Having been shut off from their last chance for escape, an increasing number of East Germans participated in the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] in Leipzig on 4, 11, and 18 September, each attracting 1,200 to 1,500 demonstrators. Many were arrested and beaten, but the people refused to be intimidated. On 25 September, the protests attracted 8,000 demonstrators.\n\nAfter the fifth successive Monday demonstration in Leipzig on 2 October attracted 10,000 protesters, [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) leader [[Erich Honecker]] issued a ''shoot and kill'' order to the military.<ref name = \"Pritchard\">{{cite book|title=Reconstructing education: East German schools and universities after unification| first = Rosalind MO | last = Pritchard|page =10}}</ref> Communists prepared a huge police, militia, [[Stasi]], and work-combat troop presence, and there were rumors a [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Square-style massacre]] was being planned for the following Monday's demonstration on 9 October.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Germany, 1918\u20132000: the divided nation| first =Mary | last = Fulbrook|page = 256}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 and 7 October, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] visited East Germany to mark the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, and urged the East German leadership to accept reform. A famous quote of his is rendered in German as \"Wer zu sp\u00e4t kommt, den bestraft das Leben\" (\"The one who comes too late is punished by life.\"). However, Honecker remained opposed to internal reform, with his regime even going so far as forbidding the circulation of Soviet publications that it viewed as subversive.\n\nIn spite of rumors that the Communists were planning a massacre on 9 October, 70,000 citizens demonstrated in Leipzig that Monday, and the authorities on the ground refused to open fire. This victory of the people facing down the Communists' guns encouraged more citizens to take to the streets. The following Monday, 16 October 120,000 people demonstrated on the streets of Leipzig.\n\nErich Honecker had hoped that the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet troops]] stationed in the GDR by the [[Warsaw Pact]] would restore the communist government and suppress the civilian protests. By 1989 the Soviet government deemed it impractical for the Soviet Union to [[Sinatra Doctrine|continue asserting its control]] over the Eastern Bloc, so it took a neutral stance regarding the events happening in East Germany. Soviet troops stationed in eastern Europe were under strict instructions from the Soviet leadership not to intervene in the political affairs of the Eastern Bloc nations and remained in their barracks. Faced with ongoing civil unrest, the SED deposed Honecker on 18 October and replaced him with the number-two-man in the regime, [[Egon Krenz]]. However, the demonstrations kept growing, and on Monday, 23 October, the Leipzig protesters numbered 300,000 and remained as large the following week.\n\nThe border to Czechoslovakia was opened again on 1 November, and the Czechoslovak authorities soon let all East Germans travel directly to West Germany without further bureaucratic ado, thus lifting their part of the Iron Curtain on 3 November. On 4 November the authorities decided to authorize a demonstration in Berlin and were faced with the [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]], where half a million citizens converged on the capital demanding freedom in the biggest protest the GDR ever witnessed. Unable to stem the ensuing flow of refugees to the West through Czechoslovakia, the East German authorities eventually caved in to public pressure by allowing East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany directly, via existing border points, on 9 November 1989, without having properly briefed the border guards. Triggered by the erratic words of regime spokesman [[G\u00fcnter Schabowski]] in a TV press conference, stating that the planned changes were in effect \"immediately, without delay,\" hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of the opportunity. The guards were quickly overwhelmed by the growing crowds of people demanding to be let out into West Berlin. After receiving no feedback from their superiors, the guards, unwilling to use force, relented and [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|opened the gates]] to West Berlin. Soon new crossing points were forced open in the [[Berlin Wall]] by the people, and sections of the wall were literally torn down as this symbol of oppression was overwhelmed. The bewildered guards were unaware of what was happening and meekly stood by as the East Germans took to the wall with hammers and chisels.\n\n[[File: RIAN archive 428452 Germany becomes one country.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin Wall, October 1990, Saying \"Thank You, [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbi]]\"]]\n\nOn 7 November, the entire ''Ministerrat der DDR'' ([[State Council of East Germany]]), including its chairman [[Willi Stoph]], resigned.<ref>[[:de:Ministerrat der DDR (1986\u20131989)]] contains all the members of the Council.</ref> A new government was formed under a considerably more liberal Communist, [[Hans Modrow]].<ref>see also [[:de:Regierung Modrow]]</ref>\nOn 1 December, the [[Volkskammer]] removed the SED's leading role from the [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|constitution of the GDR]]. \nOn 3 December Krenz resigned as leader of the SED; he resigned as head of state three days later.

The demonstrations were suppressed, but on 10 November 1989 (the day after the Berlin Wall was breached) Bulgaria's long-serving leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] was ousted by his Politburo. He was succeeded by a considerably more liberal Communist, former foreign minister [[Petar Mladenov]]. Moscow apparently approved the leadership change, as Zhivkov had been opposed to Gorbachev's policies. The new regime immediately repealed restrictions on free speech and assembly, which led to the first mass demonstration on 17 November, as well as the formation of anti-communist movements. Nine of them united as the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (UDF) on 7 December.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.sds.bg/about/history | title = History of the UDF | language = bg | publisher = SDS | place = [[Bulgaria|BG]]}}</ref> The UDF was not satisfied with Zhivkov's ouster, and demanded additional democratic reforms, most importantly the removal of the constitutionally mandated leading role of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]].\n\nMladenov announced on 11 December 1989 that the Communist Party would abandon its monopoly on power, and that multiparty elections would be held the following year. In February 1990, the Bulgarian legislature deleted the portion of the constitution about the \"leading role\" of the Communist Party. Eventually, it was decided that a round table on the Polish model would be held in 1990 and elections held by June 1990. The round table took place from 3 January to 14 May 1990, at which an agreement was reached on the transition to democracy. The Communist Party abandoned Marxism\u2013Leninism in April 1990 and renamed itself as the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]. In June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held, won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party.\n\n=== Romania ===\n{{main|Romanian Revolution}}\nAfter having suppressed the [[Bra\u015fov Rebellion]] in 1987, [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] was re-elected for another five years as leader of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) in November 1989, signalling that he intended to ride out the anti-Communist uprisings sweeping the rest of Europe. As Ceau\u015fescu prepared to go on a state visit to Iran, his [[Securitate]] ordered the arrest and exile of a local Hungarian [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] minister, [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u0151k\u00e9s]], on 16 December, for sermons offending the regime. T\u0151k\u00e9s was seized, but only after serious rioting erupted. [[Timi\u015foara]] was the first city to react on 16 December and civil unrest continued for five days.\n\n[[File:Civilian with PM Md. 1963 during the Romanian Revolution of 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Armed civilians during the [[Romanian Revolution]]. The revolution was the only violent overthrow of a [[Communist state]] in the [[Warsaw Pact]].]]\n\nReturning from Iran, Ceau\u015fescu ordered a mass rally in his support outside Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest on 21 December. However, to his shock the crowd booed and jeered him as he spoke. Years of repressed dissatisfaction boiled to the surface throughout the Romanian populace and even among elements in Ceau\u015fescu's own government, and the demonstrations spread throughout the country.\n\nAt first the security forces obeyed Ceau\u015fescu's orders to shoot protesters. However, on the morning of 22 December, the Romanian military suddenly changed sides. This came after it was announced that defense minister [[Vasile Milea]] had committed suicide after being unmasked as a traitor. Believing Milea had actually been murdered, the rank-and-file soldiers went over virtually ''en masse'' to the revolution.<ref>{{cite publication|last=Cornel|first=Ban|title=Sovereign Debt, Austerity, and Regime Change: The Case of Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania|date=13 December 2012|publisher=East European Politics & Societies|page=34|doi=10.1177/0888325412465513}}</ref> Army tanks began moving towards the Central Committee building with crowds swarming alongside them. The rioters forced open the doors of the Central Committee building in an attempt to capture Ceau\u015fescu and his wife, [[Elena Ceau\u015fescu|Elena]], coming within a few meters of the couple. However, they managed to escape via a helicopter waiting for them on the roof of the building.\n\nAlthough elation followed the flight of the Ceau\u015fescus, uncertainty surrounded their fate. On Christmas Day, Romanian television showed the Ceau\u015fescus facing a hasty trial, and then being executed by firing squad. An interim [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] Council led by [[Ion Iliescu]] took over and announced elections for April 1990, the first free elections held in Romania since 1937. These were, however, postponed until 20 May 1990. The Romanian Revolution was the bloodiest of the revolutions of 1989: over 1,000 people died, one hundred of which were children, the youngest only one month old. Unlike its kindred parties in the Warsaw Pact, the PCR simply melted away; no present-day Romanian party claiming to be its successor has ever been elected to the legislature since the change of system. However, former PCR members have played significant roles in post-1989 Romanian politics; every [[Romanian President]] until the election of [[Klaus Iohannis]] in [[2014 Romanian presidential election|2014]] was a former Communist Party member.\n\n=== Yugoslavia ===\n{{main|Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Wars}}\nThe [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was not a part of the Warsaw Pact but pursued [[Titoism|its own version]] of Communism under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. It was a multi-ethnic state which Tito was able to maintain through a [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav patriotic doctrine]] of \"[[Brotherhood and unity]]\". Tensions between ethnicities began to escalate, however, with the [[Croatian Spring]] of 1970\u201371, a movement for greater [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]]n autonomy, which was suppressed. Constitutional changes were instituted in 1974, and the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] devolved some federal powers to the constituent republics and provinces. After Tito's death in 1980 ethnic tensions grew, first in Albanian-majority [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|SAP Kosovo]] with the [[1981 protests in Kosovo]].\n\nParallel to the same process, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] initiated a policy of gradual liberalization in 1984, somewhat similar to the Soviet Perestroika. This provoked tensions between the [[League of Communists of Slovenia]] and the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|central Yugoslav Party]] and [[Yugoslav People's Army|federal army]]. In 1984 the decade long ban to build the [[Church of Saint Sava|Saint Sava Cahedral]] in [[Belgrade]] was lifted, the backdown of the communist elite and a popular gathering of 100.000 believers on 12 May 1985 to celebrate liturgy inside the walls of the ruins marked the return of religion in postwar Yugoslavia.<ref>Dunja Predi\u0107 2012: How big is all that, really?

In 1987 and 1988, a series of clashes between the emerging civil society and the Communist regime culminated with the so-called [[Slovene Spring]], a mass movement for democratic reforms. The [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]] was established as the platform of all major non-Communist political movements. By early 1989, several anti-Communist political parties were already openly functioning, challenging the hegemony of the Slovenian Communists. Soon, the Slovenian Communists, pressured by their own civil society, came into conflict with the [[League of Communists of Serbia|Serbian Communist]] leadership.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:Yugoslavia ethnic map.jpg|thumb|[[Ethnic groups in Yugoslavia]] in 1991]]\n\nIn January 1990, an extraordinary Congress of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] was called in order to settle the disputes among its constituent parties. Faced with being completely outnumbered, the Slovenian and [[League of Communists of Croatia|Croatian]] Communists walked out of the Congress on 23 January 1990, thus effectively bringing to an end to Yugoslavia's communist party. Both parties of the two western republics negotiated free multi-party elections with their own opposition movements.\n\nOn 8 April 1990, the democratic and anti-Yugoslav [[DEMOS coalition]] won the [[1990 Slovenian parliamentary election|elections in Slovenia]], while on 22 April 1990 the [[1990 Croatian parliamentary election|Croatian elections]] resulted in a landslide victory for the nationalist [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) led by [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]]. The results were much more balanced [[1990 Bosnia and Herzegovina parliamentary election|in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[1990 Macedonian parliamentary election|in Macedonia]] in November 1990, while the [[1990 Serbian parliamentary election|parliamentary]] and [[1990 Serbian presidential election|presidential]] elections of December 1990 in Serbia and [[1990 Montenegrin parliamentary election|Montenegro]] consolidated the power of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and his supporters. Free elections on the level of the federation were never carried out.\n\nThe Slovenian and Croatian leaderships started preparing plans for secession from the federation, while a part of the [[Serbs of Croatia]] started the so-called [[Log Revolution]], an insurrection organized by [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]] that would lead to the creation of the breakaway region of [[SAO Krajina]]. In the [[1990 Slovenian independence referendum|Slovenian independence referendum]] on 23 December 1990, 88.5% of residents voted for independence.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |publisher=Sussex |place=UK |title=Slovenian Referendum Briefing No. 3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218000730/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |archivedate=18 December 2010 }}</ref> In the [[1991 Croatian independence referendum|Croatian independence referendum]] on 19 May 1991, 93.24% voted for independence.\n\nThe escalating ethnic and national tensions were exacerbated by the drive for independence and led to the following [[Yugoslav wars]]:\n* [[Ten-Day War|War in Slovenia]] (1991)\n* [[Croatian War of Independence]] (1991\u20131995)\n* [[Bosnian War]] (1992\u20131995)\n* [[Kosovo War]] (1998\u20131999), including the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].\n\nIn addition, the [[insurgency in the Pre\u0161evo Valley]] (1999\u20132001) and the [[insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia]] (2001) are also often discussed in the same context.{{Sfn | Judah |  2011}}{{Sfn | Naimark | Case | 2003 | p = xvii}}{{Sfn | Rogel | 2004 | pp = 91\u201392}}\n\n=== Albania ===\n{{main|Fall of communism in Albania}} <!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Fall of Communism in Albania.JPG|thumb|left|The fall of Enver Hoxha's Statue in central Tirana on 11 December 1990]] -->\nIn the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], [[Enver Hoxha]], who led Albania for four decades, died on 11 April 1985. His successor, [[Ramiz Alia]], began to gradually open up the regime from above. In 1989, the first revolts started in [[Shkodra]] and spread in other cities. Eventually, the existing regime introduced some liberalization, including measures in 1990 providing for freedom to travel abroad. Efforts were begun to improve ties with the outside world. March 1991 elections\u2014the first free elections in Albania since 1923, and only the third free elections in the country's history\u2014left the former Communists in power, but a general strike and urban opposition led to the formation of a coalition cabinet including non-Communists.

In November 1991, the People's Great Hural began discussion on a [[Constitution of Mongolia|new constitution]], which entered into force on 12 February 1992.

In the \"Anti Bourgeois Liberalization Campaign\", Hu would be further denounced.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square protests were sparked by the death of Hu Yaobang on 15 April 1989.

In Beijing, the military response to the protest by the PRC government left many civilians in charge of clearing the square of the dead and severely injured. The exact number of casualties is not known and many different estimates exist. The event, however, did make some political change; the most notable being that [[China]] started to open up its economy. This allowed for the country to bring in large sums of money and also started the wave of mass migration from rural Western China to urban Eastern China. The problem with the mass migration is that it has now started a deepening divide between the rural poor and the rich urban people.<ref>{{Citation|title=FRONTLINE {{!}} The Tank Man {{!}} Season 2006 {{!}} Episode 8|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/frontline-the-tank-man/|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>\n\n== Malta Summit ==\n[[File:Bush and Gorbachev at the Malta summit in 1989.gif|thumb|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and President [[George H.

At a summit later that same month, Gorbachev and Bush declared a US\u2013Soviet strategic partnership, decisively marking the end of the Cold War. President Bush declared that US\u2013Soviet cooperation during the 1990\u20131991 [[Gulf War]] had laid the groundwork for a partnership in resolving bilateral and world problems.\n\nAs the Soviet Union rapidly withdrew its forces from Central and Southeast Europe, the spillover from the 1989 upheavals began reverberating throughout the Soviet Union itself. Agitation for self-determination led to first Lithuania, and then Estonia, Latvia and Armenia declaring independence. However, the Soviet central government demanded the revocation of the declarations and threatened military action and economic sanctions. The government even went as far as controversially sending [[Soviet Army]] troops to the streets of the Lithuanian capital, [[Vilnius]], to [[January Events (Lithuania)|suppress the separatist movements]] in January 1991, causing the deaths of 14 people.\n\nDisaffection in other Soviet republics, such as Georgia and Azerbaijan, was countered by promises of greater decentralization. More open elections led to the election of candidates opposed to Communist Party rule.\n\n''Glasnost'' had inadvertently released the long-suppressed national sentiments of all peoples within the borders of the multinational Soviet state. These nationalist movements were further strengthened by the rapid deterioration of the Soviet economy, whose ramshackle foundations were exposed with the removal of Communist discipline. Gorbachev's reforms had failed to improve the economy, with the old Soviet [[planned economy|command structure]] completely breaking down. One by one, the constituent republics created their own economic systems and voted to subordinate Soviet laws to local laws. In 1990, the Communist Party was forced to surrender its seven-decade monopoly of political power when the Supreme Soviet rescinded the clause in the Soviet Constitution that guaranteed its sole authority to rule. Gorbachev's policies caused the Communist Party to lose its grip over the media. Details of the Soviet Union's past were quickly being declassified. This caused many to distrust the 'old system' and push for greater autonomy and independence.\n\n[[File:Image0 ST.jpg|thumb|left|Tanks in Moscow's [[Red Square]] during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|1991 coup attempt]]]]\n\nAfter a referendum confirmed the preservation of the Soviet Union but in a looser form, a group of Soviet hard-liners represented by Vice-President [[Gennadi Yanayev]] launched [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|a coup attempting to overthrow Gorbachev]] in August 1991. [[Boris Yeltsin]], then president of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], rallied the people and much of the army against the coup and the effort collapsed. Although restored to power, Gorbachev's authority had been irreparably undermined. Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party following the coup, and the Supreme Soviet dissolved the Party and banned all Communist activity on Soviet soil. Just a few weeks later, the government granted the Baltic states their independence on 6 September.\n\nOver the next three months, one republic after another declared independence, mostly out of fear of another coup. Also during this time, the Soviet government was rendered useless as the new Russian government began taking over what remained of it, including the Kremlin. The penultimate step came on 1 December, when voters in the second most powerful republic, Ukraine, overwhelmingly voted to secede from the Soviet Union in a referendum. This ended any realistic chance of keeping the Soviet Union together. On 8 December, Yeltsin met with his counterparts from Ukraine and Belarus and signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], declaring that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. Gorbachev denounced this as illegal, but he had long since lost any ability to influence events outside of Moscow.\n\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|Changes in national boundaries after the end of the [[Cold War]]]]\n\nTwo weeks later, 11 of the remaining 12 republics\u2014all except Georgia\u2014signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], which confirmed the Soviet Union had been effectively dissolved and replaced by a new voluntary association, the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Bowing to the inevitable, Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president on 25 December, and the Supreme Soviet ratified the Belavezha Accords the next day, legally dissolving itself and the Soviet Union as a political entity. By the end of 1991, the few Soviet institutions that hadn't been taken over by Russia had dissolved. The Soviet Union was officially disbanded, breaking up into fifteen constituent parts, thereby ending the world's largest and most influential Socialist state, and leaving to China that position. A [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] dissolved into violence in Moscow as the [[Russian Army]] was called in to reestablish order.\n\n=== Baltic states ===\n{{main|Singing Revolution}}\n[[File:1989 08 23 Baltijoskelias14.jpg|thumb|[[Baltic Way]] was a [[Human chain (politics)|human chain]] of approximately two million people dedicated to liberating the [[Baltic Republics]] from the [[Soviet Union]].]]\n\nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania implemented democratic reforms and achieved independence from the Soviet Union.

Lithuania followed on 18 May 1989 and Latvia on 28 July 1989. [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|Lithuania declared full independence]] on 11 March 1990 and on 30 March, Estonia announced the start of a transitional period to independence, [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|followed by Latvia]] on 4 May. These declarations were met with force from the Soviet Union in early 1991, in confrontations known as the [[January Events (Lithuania)|\"January Events\" in Lithuania]] and \"[[The Barricades]]\" in Latvia. The Baltic states contended that their incorporation into the Soviet Union had been illegal under both international law and their own law, and they were reasserting an independence that still legally existed.\n\nSoon after the launching of the August coup, Estonia and Latvia declared full independence. By the time the coup was foiled, the USSR was no longer unified enough to mount a forceful resistance, and it recognized the independence of the Baltic states on 6 September.\n\n=== Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova ===\n* {{flag|Belarus|1991}} declared full independence from the USSR on 25 August 1991. The main political changes of the early 1990s were driven by the [[Belarusian Popular Front]] and its fraction in the [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus]]. A few years later, a new post-communist leader, [[Alexander Lukashenko|Alyaksandr Lukashenka]], obtained power. After a short period, he increased his power as a result of two controversial referendums (1995\u201396) and has been criticized for [[Human rights in Belarus|repressing political opposition]] ever since.\n* {{flag|Moldova}} participated in the [[War of Transnistria]] between Moldova and Russian-connected forces in the separatist region of [[Transnistria]].

Presidencies of former Communists [[Leonid Kravchuk]] and [[Leonid Kuchma]] were followed by the [[Orange Revolution]] in 2004, in which Ukrainians elected [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (also a former member of [[CPSU]]).\n\n=== Transcaucasia ===\n[[File:April9victims.jpg|thumb|Photos of 9 April 1989 victims of the [[Tbilisi massacre]] on a billboard in [[Tbilisi]]]]\n[[File:Georgia, Ossetia, Russia and Abkhazia (en).svg|thumb|Following Georgia's declaration of independence in 1991, [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]] declared their desire to leave Georgia and remain part of the Soviet Union/Russia.<ref name=\"princeton\">{{cite web |title=Georgia: Abkhazia and South Ossetia |url=https://pesd.princeton.edu/?q=node/274 |website=www.pesd.princeton.edu |publisher=Encyclopedia Princetoniensis}}</ref>]]\n\n* {{flag|Georgia|1990}} and the [[North Caucasus]] have been marred by ethnic and sectarian violence since the collapse of the USSR.

A coup d'\u00e9tat installed former Communist leader [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] as President of Georgia until the [[Rose Revolution]] in 2003.\n* {{flag|Armenia}}'s independence struggle included violence as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Armenia became increasingly militarized (with the ascendancy of Kocharian, a former president of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], often viewed as a milestone), while elections have since been increasingly controversial, and government corruption became rifer. After Kocharyan, notably, [[Serzh Sargsyan]] ascended to power. Sargsyan is often noted as the \"founder of the Armenian and Karabakh militaries\" and was, in the past, defense minister and national security minister.\n* {{flag|Azerbaijan}}'s [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party|Popular Front Party]] won the first elections with the self-described pro-Western, populist nationalist Elchibey. However, Elchibey planned to end Moscow's advantage in the harvesting of Azeri oil and build much stronger links with Turkey and Europe, and as a result was overthrown by former Communists in a coup backed by Russia and Iran (which viewed the new country as a compelling threat, with territorial ambitions within Iranian borders and also being a strong economic rival).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Glenn E.|title=Azerbaijan: A Country Study|date=1995}}</ref> Mutallibov rose to power, but he was soon destabilized and eventually ousted due to popular frustration with his perceived incompetence, corruption and improper handling of the war with Armenia. Azerbaijani KGB and Azerbaijani SSR leader [[Heydar Aliyev]] captured power and remained president until he transferred the presidency to his son in 2003. The [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and has largely defined the fates of both countries. However, unlike Armenia, which remains a strong Russian ally, Azerbaijan has begun, since Russia's 2008 war with Georgia, to foster better relations with Turkey and other Western nations, while lessening ties with Russia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nagorno-Karabakh profile|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18270325|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Chechnya ===\n[[File:Evstafiev-chechnya-women-pray.jpg|thumb|[[Chechnya|Chechen]] women praying for Russian troops not to advance towards [[Grozny]] during the [[First Chechen War]], December 1994.]]\n\nIn [[Chechnya]] (an [[Autonomous republics of the Soviet Union|autonomous republic]] within [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] that had a strong desire for independence), using tactics partly copied from the Baltics, anti-Communist coalition forces led by former Soviet general [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] staged a largely bloodless revolution, and ended up forcing the resignation of the Communist republican president. Dudayev was elected in a landslide in the following election and in November 1991 he proclaimed [[Checheno-Ingushetia]]'s independence as the Republic of Ichkeria. Ingushetia voted to leave the union with Chechnya, and was allowed to do so (thus it became the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria). Due to Dudayev's desire to exclude Moscow from all oil deals, Yeltsin backed a failed coup against him in 1993. In 1994, Chechnya, with only marginal recognition (one country: Georgia, which was revoked soon after the coup landing Shevardnadze in power), was invaded by Russia, spurring the [[First Chechen War]]. The Chechens, with considerable assistance from the populations of both former-Soviet countries and from Sunni Muslim countries repelled this invasion and a peace treaty was signed in 1997. However, Chechnya became increasingly anarchic, largely due to the both political and physical destruction of the state during the invasion, and general Shamil Basaev, having evaded all control by the central government, conducted raids into neighboring Dagestan, which Russia used as pretext for reinvading Ichkeria. Ichkeria was then reincorporated into Russia as Chechnya again, though insurgency continues.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.rbc.ru/politics/12/05/2017/5915d8799a794757ef77f42e |title = \u0418\u0413 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0432 \u0418\u043d\u0433\u0443\u0448\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0438}}</ref>\n\n=== Central Asia ===\n* {{flag|Kazakhstan|1991}}'s independence struggle began with the [[Jeltoqsan]] uprising in 1986.

Even the isolationist Stalinist regime in Albania was unable to stem the tide. Gorbachev's abrogation of the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] was perhaps the key factor that enabled the popular uprisings to succeed. Once it became evident that the feared Soviet Army would not intervene to crush dissent, the Central, South-East and Eastern European regimes were exposed as vulnerable in the face of popular uprisings against the one-party system and power of [[secret police]].\n\n[[Coit D. Blacker]] wrote in 1990 that the Soviet leadership \"appeared to have believed that whatever loss of authority the Soviet Union might suffer in Central and South-East Europe would be more than offset by a net increase in its influence in western Europe.\"<ref name=\"fa90\">{{Citation | first = Coit D | last = Blacker | title = The Collapse of Soviet Power in Europe | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 70 | pages = 88 | year = 1990| doi = 10.2307/20044696 | jstor = 20044696 }}.</ref> Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Gorbachev ever intended for the complete dismantling of Communism and the Warsaw Pact. Rather, Gorbachev assumed that the Communist parties of Central and South-East Europe could be reformed in a similar way to the reforms he hoped to achieve in the CPSU. Just as ''perestroika'' was aimed at making the Soviet Union more efficient economically and politically, Gorbachev believed that the [[Comecon]] and Warsaw Pact could be reformed into more effective entities. However, [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], a close advisor to Gorbachev, would later state that it would have been \"absurd to keep the system\" in Central and South-East Europe. Yakovlev had come to the conclusion that the Soviet-dominated Comecon could not work on non-market principles and that the Warsaw Pact had \"no relevance to real life\".<ref>{{citation|author=Steele,

The constitution of [[Namibia]] defines the role of the military as ''\"defending the territory and national interests.\"''\n\nNamibia's military was born from the integration of the formerly belligerent [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN), military wing of the [[South West African People's Organization]], and the [[South West African Territorial Force]] (SWATF) - a security arm of the former South African administration. The British formulated the force integration plan and began training the NDF, which consists of five battalions and a small headquarters element.<ref>http://www.satruth.co.za/peace.htm.

Retrieved June 2012. Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers.

Retrieved June 2012. Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].
