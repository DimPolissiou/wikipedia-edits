The regiment was created as part of the [[Childers Reforms]] in 1881, when the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot (The Black Watch)]] was amalgamated with the [[73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot]]. It was known as The Black Watch (Royal Highlanders) from 1881 to 1931 and The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) from 1931 to 2006. Part of the [[Scottish Division]] for administrative purposes from 1967, it was the senior [[Highland Brigade (United Kingdom)| Highland regiment]]. It has been part of the [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] for administrative purposes from 2017.\n\n== Source of the name ==\n{{See also|Independent Highland Companies}}\nThe source of the regiment's name is uncertain. In 1725, following the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite rebellion of 1715]], General [[George Wade]] was authorised by [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] to form six \"watch\" companies to patrol the Highlands of [[Scotland]], three from [[Clan Campbell]], one from [[Clan Fraser of Lovat]], one from [[Clan Munro]] and one from [[Clan Grant]]. These were to be \"employed in disarming the Highlanders, preventing depredations, bringing criminals to justice, and hindering rebels and attainted persons from inhabiting that part of the kingdom.\" The force was known in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] as ''Am Freiceadan Dubh,'' \"the dark\" or \"black watch\".<ref>Simpson, p. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nThis epithet may have come from the uniform plaids of dark [[tartan]] with which the companies were provided.  Other theories have been put forward; for instance, that the name referred to the \"black hearts\" of the pro-government militia who had sided with the \"enemies of true Highland spirit\",<ref>Parker, p. 13\u201314</ref> or that it came from their original duty in policing the Highlands, namely preventing \"blackmail\" (Highlanders demanding extortion payments to spare cattle herds).<ref>Trevor-Roper, p. 205</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe regiment was created as part of the [[Childers Reforms]] in 1881, when the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot (The Black Watch)]] was amalgamated with the [[73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot]] to form two battalions of the newly named Black Watch (Royal Highlanders).

The regiment was created as part of the [[Childers Reforms]] in 1881, when the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot (The Black Watch)]] was amalgamated with the [[73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot]]. It was known as The Black Watch (Royal Highlanders) from 1881 to 1931 and The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) from 1931 to 2006. Part of the [[Scottish Division]] for administrative purposes from 1967, it was the senior [[Highland Brigade (United Kingdom)| Highland regiment]]. It has been part of the [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] for administrative purposes from 2017.\n\n== Source of the name ==\n{{See also|Independent Highland Companies}}\nThe source of the regiment's name is uncertain. In 1725, following the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite rebellion of 1715]], General [[George Wade]] was authorised by [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] to form six \"watch\" companies to patrol the Highlands of [[Scotland]], three from [[Clan Campbell]], one from [[Clan Fraser of Lovat]], one from [[Clan Munro]] and one from [[Clan Grant]]. These were to be \"employed in disarming the Highlanders, preventing depredations, bringing criminals to justice, and hindering rebels and attainted persons from inhabiting that part of the kingdom.\" The force was known in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] as ''Am Freiceadan Dubh,'' \"the dark\" or \"black watch\".<ref>Simpson, p. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nThis epithet may have come from the uniform plaids of dark [[tartan]] with which the companies were provided.  Other theories have been put forward; for instance, that the name referred to the \"black hearts\" of the pro-government militia who had sided with the \"enemies of true Highland spirit\",<ref>Parker, p. 13\u201314</ref> or that it came from their original duty in policing the Highlands, namely preventing \"blackmail\" (Highlanders demanding extortion payments to spare cattle herds).<ref>Trevor-Roper, p. 205</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe regiment was created as part of the [[Childers Reforms]] in 1881, when the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot (The Black Watch)]] was amalgamated with the [[73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot]] to form two battalions of the newly named Black Watch (Royal Highlanders).

Directed by [[Luca Guadagnino]] and written by [[James Ivory]], the film follows Elio Perlman, a precocious 17-year-old as he spends the summer of 1983 with his family in their 17th-century villa in Lombardy, Italy. He soon meets Oliver, a handsome doctoral student who's working as an intern for Elio's father. Amid the sun-drenched splendor of their surroundings, romance blossoms between Elio and Oliver as they discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.\n \nFor his portrayal, Chalamet received nominations for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]], a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]], a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award]], a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role|Screen Actors Guild Award]], and a [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor|Critics' Choice Award]], all for Best Actor. He also won numerous critics awards, namely [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor|New York Film Critics Circle Award]], [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor|Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award]] and [[London Film Critics' Circle Award for Actor of the Year|London Film Critics' Circle Award]].\n\n==Characterization==\n\nElio Perlman is a 17-year-old Jewish-American boy. He is intellectual and artistic, spending a great deal of time playing piano, perfecting classical pieces as well as composing his own. He is sensitive and charming, although at times, showing naivety and unable to articulate all that he feels. He is the protagonist of the coming-of-age story, a teenager on the brink of manhood, passionate and libidinous, experiencing love for the first time.\n\nThe son of Jewish-American intellectual scholars, Elio is an intelligent young man who is trilingual, well-read, and a talented musician. He spends his summers working on classical scores, playing the guitar and piano, reading, swimming with friends, and playing tennis. He is initially attracted to and in sexual relationship with Marzia. When he meets Oliver though, his attraction eclipses his other interests. During Oliver's stay in his family's house, Elio tries to spend as much time as possible in the presence of this alluring man. Although he understands he's attracted to Oliver, it takes time for Elio to decide if he wants anything to happen between them.ele gosta de dar o cu\n\n==Relationships==\n\n===Marzia===\n\nMarzia is Elio's Italian girlfriend. The two share a reciprocity love and mutual attraction towards one another. After meeting Oliver, Mariza is confused by his apparent ambivalence about her. While she never gets angry at him explicitly, she is clearly wounded by his indifference towards her. When Oliver later leaves, Marzia realizes that Elio has been in love with Oliver all along, she tells him that she is not upset and offers him her friendship alongside their relationship. Fifteen years later, the pair are mentioned to have married, Marzia maintaining a tender and heartfelt relationship with Elio.\n\n===Oliver===\n\nOliver is a 24-year-old Jewish-American graduate student who is writing and researching with Elio's father in Italy. He is a cheerful, breezy person, although often unpredictable and impulsive, contrasting to Elio's personality. While he is intellectual and thoughtful, he is also more confident and sociable than Elio, often participating in social drinking, playing games, and seducing young women without care. Where Elio is more hesitant and introverted, Oliver chooses to cope with his confusion about his own emotions by throwing himself at things impulsively.

In the early days of their courtship, they find it easiest to talk about intellectual and artistic matters. Oliver asks Elio about the music he is playing, lightly challenging his claims about the compositions. He asks Elio what he thinks of a sentence from his academic work, and they engage in light banter about intellectual matters.

Amid the sun-drenched splendor of their surroundings, romance blossoms between Elio and Oliver as they discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.\n \nFor his portrayal, Chalamet received nominations for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]], a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]], a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award]], a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role|Screen Actors Guild Award]], and a [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor|Critics' Choice Award]], all for Best Actor.

He is intellectual and artistic, spending a great deal of time playing piano, perfecting classical pieces as well as composing his own. He is sensitive and charming, although at times, showing naivety and unable to articulate all that he feels. He is the protagonist of the coming-of-age story, a teenager on the brink of manhood, passionate and libidinous, experiencing love for the first time.\n\nThe son of Jewish-American intellectual scholars, Elio is an intelligent young man who is trilingual, well-read, and a talented musician. He spends his summers working on classical scores, playing the guitar and piano, reading, swimming with friends, and playing tennis. He is initially attracted to and in sexual relationship with Marzia. When he meets Oliver though, his attraction eclipses his other interests. During Oliver's stay in his family's house, Elio tries to spend as much time as possible in the presence of this alluring man. Although he understands he's attracted to Oliver, it takes time for Elio to decide if he wants anything to happen between them.\n\n==Relationships==\n\n===Marzia===\n\nMarzia is Elio's Italian girlfriend. The two share a reciprocity love and mutual attraction towards one another. After meeting Oliver, Mariza is confused by his apparent ambivalence about her. While she never gets angry at him explicitly, she is clearly wounded by his indifference towards her. When Oliver later leaves, Marzia realizes that Elio has been in love with Oliver all along, she tells him that she is not upset and offers him her friendship alongside their relationship. Fifteen years later, the pair are mentioned to have married, Marzia maintaining a tender and heartfelt relationship with Elio.\n\n===Oliver===\n\nOliver is a 24-year-old Jewish-American graduate student who is writing and researching with Elio's father in Italy. He is a cheerful, breezy person, although often unpredictable and impulsive, contrasting to Elio's personality. While he is intellectual and thoughtful, he is also more confident and sociable than Elio, often participating in social drinking, playing games, and seducing young women without care. Where Elio is more hesitant and introverted, Oliver chooses to cope with his confusion about his own emotions by throwing himself at things impulsively. Unlike Elio, he did not have an accepting upbringing and experiences more shame and ambivalence about his homosexual feelings.\n\nSoon enough, Elio feels tortured by the idea that his attraction might slip by unnoticed, so he tells Oliver how he feels. In doing so, he shatters the indecision and relational calculations that have been tormenting him for weeks, though even when he and Oliver finally kiss, he isn't sure what to make of their connection. Similarly, he feels confused after they have sex, ultimately experiencing something like shame even though he's glad to have acted on his feelings.\n\nIn the beginning of their acquaintanceship, Oliver and Elio do not quite know what to think of one another, or how to deal with their mutual attraction. In the early days of their courtship, they find it easiest to talk about intellectual and artistic matters. Oliver asks Elio about the music he is playing, lightly challenging his claims about the compositions. He asks Elio what he thinks of a sentence from his academic work, and they engage in light banter about intellectual matters. Thus, before their connection becomes physical or romantic, it is based on matters of the mind and questions of aesthetics.\n\n===Sami Perlman===\n\nSami Perlman is an archeology professor and Elio's father. He invites grad student Oliver to live with his family in Italy over the summer. He is passionate and warm-hearted, smiling genially at nearly every opportunity, and encouraging his son's friendship and eventual affair with Oliver. Towards the end of the film and novel, he expresses his approval for Elio and Oliver's relationship, suggesting that the love they share something very special, and urging Elio not to repress his feelings about their relationship.\n\n==Casting==\nIn 2015, it was reported that [[Shia LaBeouf]] and [[Greta Scacchi]] were set to be cast in a film adaptation of the novel.<ref name=\"NYTivoryprofile\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/t-magazine/james-ivory-house.html|title=James Ivory's Home Befits His Extraordinary Life|first=Nancy|last=Hass|work=[[The New York Times Style Magazine]]|date=September 11, 2015|accessdate=May 8, 2017|page=M2191|publication-date=September 13, 2015|issue=T|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407002210/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/t-magazine/james-ivory-house.html|archivedate=April 7, 2017}}</ref> In September 2016, Ivory had confirmed that the duo were no longer involved in the project.

The [[Gothic Revival]] structure was designed to serve LaGrange College when this Methodist institution relocated from Franklin to Lauderdale county and subsequently was renamed and rechartered as Florence Wesleyan University.<ref name=\"UNA Public and Tourist Attractions\">[http://www2.una.edu/universityrelations/attractions.htm \"UNA Public and Tourist Attractions,\" Office of University Relations, University of North Alabama]</ref>\n\nIn 1856, the year the structure was completed, a President's Report showed an enrollment of 180 students. The fledgling university peaked at 225 students in the early 1860s, shortly before the outbreak of the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"The 175-Year March from the 19th Century into the 21st\">Steen, Robert S., \"The 175-Year March from the 19th into the 21st,\" UNA Magazine, Summer, 2005</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Wesleyan Hall was occupied by both Union and Confederate armies.<ref name=\"UNA Public and Tourist Attractions\"/> \n[[Image:William Tecumseh Sherman.jpg|right|thumb|220px|General William Tecumseh Sherman is considered the most famous Union officer to occupy Wesleyan Hall during the Civil War.]]General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] is considered the most famous Union occupant of Wesleyan Hall during the war.<ref name=\"Leo's Tale: University of North Alabama Trivia\">Smith, William E., \"Leo's Tale: University of North Alabama Trivia, Florence, AL, Shoals Heritage Publishers, 2000.</ref> In late 1864, shortly before his ill-fated involvement in the battles of [[Battle of Franklin|Franklin]] and [[Battle of Nashville|Nashville]], Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]] occupied the building.  The surrounding grounds were occupied by his troops and served as a meeting place for military personnel and townspeople for parties, dances and concerts.  Confederate Generals [[Pierre G.T. Beauregard]] and [[Stephen D. Lee]] also occupied the adjoining grounds during the war and also may have used Wesleyan Hall as their headquarters.\n\nFollowing the war, Dr. Septimus Rice was the University's sole instructor, teaching classes in the Preparatory School and holding college-level courses in Wesleyan Hall.  Despite a prolonged effort by the new Wesleyan University president, Dr. William H. Anderson, the institution continued to founder, and in 1871, the doors of Wesleyan Hall were closed.\n\nRecognizing the need for trained teachers in the post-war South, the Methodist Episcopal Church turned over Wesleyan Hall and the surrounding {{convert|12|acre|m2|adj=on}} grounds to the state of [[Alabama]], which then chartered it as a state [[normal school]].\n\nDuring this period, the halls of Wesleyan remained unheated, so stoves were used to warm classrooms, while coal oil lamps were employed for lighting. Because of the initially small enrollment, the upper floors were used as [[dormitory|dormitories]].\n\nA dilapidated white-washed board fence stood along the perimeter of the Wesleyan grounds to prevent livestock owned by nearby townspeople from wandering onto campus. On the south side of the structure in a similar state of disrepair stood a number of old stables used to quarter horses of local country boys attending the school. A large [[cistern]] in the rear of the Wesleyan supplied the school's water supply.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the 45-year-old structure remained the only building owned by the school. The exterior of the building had changed little since its construction in 1856, bearing the same castle-like towers, battlements and top-floor [[observatory]]. Likewise, the campus adjoining Wesleyan encompassed only the original {{convert|12|acre|m2}}.\n\nA three-story building finally was added in 1909 to accommodate increased enrollment and became known as Wesleyan Annex.<ref name=\"The 175-Year March from the 19th Century into the 21st\"/>\n\n==Today==\n\nNow part of the {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=on}} University of North Alabama campus, Wesleyan Hall currently contains the departments of Geography, Psychology, and Foreign Languages.  It also houses the Geographic Research Center, a cartography lab, and a language lab.\n\nThe Department of Military Science is located in Wesleyan Annex.\n\nWesleyan also houses personal effects and mementoes of former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice and U.S. Senator [[Howell Heflin]], a native of nearby Tuscumbia.

The [[Gothic Revival]] structure was designed to serve LaGrange College when this Methodist institution relocated from Franklin to Lauderdale county and subsequently was renamed and rechartered as Florence Wesleyan University.<ref name=\"UNA Public and Tourist Attractions\">[http://www2.una.edu/universityrelations/attractions.htm \"UNA Public and Tourist Attractions,\" Office of University Relations, University of North Alabama]</ref>\n\nIn 1856, the year the structure was completed, a President's Report showed an enrollment of 180 students. The fledgling university peaked at 225 students in the early 1860s, shortly before the outbreak of the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"The 175-Year March from the 19th Century into the 21st\">Steen, Robert S., \"The 175-Year March from the 19th into the 21st,\" UNA Magazine, Summer, 2005</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Wesleyan Hall was occupied by both Union and Confederate armies.<ref name=\"UNA Public and Tourist Attractions\"/> \n[[Image:William Tecumseh Sherman.jpg|right|thumb|220px|General William Tecumseh Sherman is considered the most famous Union officer to occupy Wesleyan Hall during the Civil War.]]General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] is considered the most famous Union occupant of Wesleyan Hall during the war.<ref name=\"Leo's Tale: University of North Alabama Trivia\">Smith, William E., \"Leo's Tale: University of North Alabama Trivia, Florence, AL, Shoals Heritage Publishers, 2000.</ref> In late 1864, shortly before his ill-fated involvement in the battles of [[Battle of Franklin|Franklin]] and [[Battle of Nashville|Nashville]], Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]] occupied the building.  The surrounding grounds were occupied by his troops and served as a meeting place for military personnel and townspeople for parties, dances and concerts.  Confederate Generals [[Pierre G.T. Beauregard]] and [[Stephen D. Lee]] also occupied the adjoining grounds during the war and also may have used Wesleyan Hall as their headquarters. \n\nFollowing the war, Dr. Septimus Rice was the University's sole instructor, teaching classes in the Preparatory School and holding college-level courses in Wesleyan Hall.  Despite a prolonged effort by the new Wesleyan University president, Dr. William H. Anderson, the institution continued to founder, and in 1871, the doors of Wesleyan Hall were closed.  \n\nRecognizing the need for trained teachers in the post-war South, the Methodist Episcopal Church turned over Wesleyan Hall and the surrounding {{convert|12|acre|m2|adj=on}} grounds to the state of [[Alabama]], which then chartered it as a state [[normal school]].\n\nDuring this period, the halls of Wesleyan remained unheated, so stoves were used to warm classrooms, while coal oil lamps were employed for lighting. Because of the initially small enrollment, the upper floors were used as [[dormitory|dormitories]].\n\nA dilapidated white-washed board fence stood along the perimeter of the Wesleyan grounds to prevent livestock owned by nearby townspeople from wandering onto campus. On the south side of the structure in a similar state of disrepair stood a number of old stables used to quarter horses of local country boys attending the school. A large [[cistern]] in the rear of the Wesleyan supplied the school's water supply.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the 45-year-old structure remained the only building owned by the school. The exterior of the building had changed little since its construction in 1856, bearing the same castle-like towers, battlements and top-floor [[observatory]]. Likewise, the campus adjoining Wesleyan encompassed only the original {{convert|12|acre|m2}}. \n\nA three-story building finally was added in 1909 to accommodate increased enrollment and became known as Wesleyan Annex.<ref name=\"The 175-Year March from the 19th Century into the 21st\">Steen, Robert S., \"The 175-Year March from the 19th into the 21st,\" UNA Magazine, Summer, 2005</ref>\n\n==Today==\n\nNow part of the {{convert|130|acre|km2|sing=on}} University of North Alabama campus, Wesleyan Hall currently contains the departments of Geography, Psychology, and Foreign Languages.  It also houses the Geographic Research Center, a cartography lab, and a language lab.  \n\nThe Department of Military Science is located in Wesleyan Annex.  \n\nWesleyan also houses personal effects and mementoes of former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice and U.S. Senator [[Howell Heflin]], a native of nearby Tuscumbia.
