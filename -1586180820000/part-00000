Rapture is a sign of the second coming of Christ. It will occur 7 years before the Master's return. During rapture, the dead in Christ will be resurrected first and then be caught up together with other Christians (that are alive) at the same time to meet the Lord in the air while they make their way to Heaven. Christ is not stepping on earth during rapture until He returns back (in 7years) to the earth with the Christians that raptured.\n\nIn [[Paul the Apostle]]'s [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]] in the [[Bible]], he uses the Greek word ''harpazo'' ({{lang-grc|\u1f01\u03c1\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9}}), meaning \"to snatch away\" or \"to seize,\" and explains that believers in Jesus Christ will be snatched away from earth into the air.<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Thessalonians|4:17|NASB}}</ref> The term is most frequently used among conservative Christian theologians in the [[United States]].<ref>Cf.

The tribulation is typically divided into two periods of 3.5 years each. Mid-tribulationists hold that the saints will go through the first period (Beginning of Travail), but will be raptured into Heaven before the severe outpouring of God's wrath in the second half of what is popularly called the great tribulation. Mid-tribulationists appeal to {{bible verse||Daniel|7:25|KJV}} which says the saints will be given over to tribulation for \"time, times, and half a time,\" - interpreted to mean 3.5 years. At the halfway point of the tribulation, the Antichrist will commit the \"abomination of desolation\" by desecrating the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem temple]].

This latter half of a seven-year period [i.e. 3 1/2 years] is defined as the great tribulation, although the exact duration is not known. References from Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21 are used as evidence that this tribulation will be cut short by the coming of Christ to deliver the righteous by means of the rapture, which will occur after specific events in Revelation, in particular after the sixth seal is opened and the sun is darkened and the moon is turned to blood.<ref>{{cite web|title= Welcome to the Pre-Wrath Consortium |website= Pre-Wrath Consortium |url= http://www.bibliology.org/PW |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20041020000043/http://bibliology.org/PW/ |archivedate= 2004-10-20}}</ref> However, by this point many Christians will have been slaughtered as martyrs by the [[Antichrist]].

Post-tribulation writers define the tribulation period in a generic sense as the entire present age, or in a specific sense of a period of time preceding the second coming of Christ.<ref>{{cite book |first= John F. |last= Walvoord |authorlink= John Walvoord |title= The Rapture Question |publisher= [[Zondervan]] |date= 1979-08-12 |origyear= 1957 |edition= Revised and enlarged |url= |isbn=978-0-310-34151-2 |page= 128}}</ref> The emphasis in this view is that the church will undergo the tribulation.<ref>{{Cite book | title = A Basic Guide to Eschatology: Making Sense of the Millennium | last = Erickson | first = Millard J. | publisher = [[Baker Publishing Group|Baker Book House]] | location = Grand Rapids, Michigan |date= 1998-12-01 |edition= revised |origyear= 1977 |page= 152 |url= https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Guide-Eschatology-Making-Millennium/dp/0801058368/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427829809&sr=1-1#reader_0801058368 | isbn = 0-8010-5836-8}} Originally published in 1977 under the title ''Contemporary Options in Eschatology: A Study of the Millennium''.</ref> {{bible verse||Matthew|24:29\u201331|KJV}} - \"''Immediately after the Tribulation of those days...they shall gather together his elect...''\" - is cited as a foundational scripture for this view. Post-tribulationists perceive the rapture as occurring simultaneously with the second coming of Christ. Upon Jesus' return, believers will meet him in the air and will then accompany him in his return to the Earth. In the [[Epistles of Paul]], most notably in {{bible verse|1|Thessalonians|4:16-17|KJV}} (\"the dead in Christ shall rise first\") and {{bible verse|1|Corinthians|15:51-52|KJV}}, a [[Shofar|trumpet]] is described as blowing at the end of the tribulation to herald the return of Christ; {{bible verse||Revelation|11:15|KJV}} further supports this view. Moreover, after chapters 6\u201319, and after 20:1-3 when Satan is bound, {{bibleverse||Revelation|20:4-6|KJV}} says, \"and they lived, and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This ''is'' the first resurrection. Blessed and holy ''is'' he that hath part in the first resurrection.\"\n\nAuthors and teachers who support the post-tribulational view include [[Pat Robertson]], [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter R.

According to [[Loraine Boettner]] \"the world will be Christianized, and the return of Christ will occur at the close of a long period of righteousness and peace, commonly called the millennium.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boettner|first1=Loraine|title=The millennium|date=1984|publisher=Presbyterian and Reformed Pub. Co.|location=[Phillipsburg, N.J.]|isbn=978-0875521138|edition=[Rev. ed].}}</ref> Postmillennialists commonly view the rapture of the Church as one and the same event as the second coming of Christ. According to them the great tribulation was already fulfilled in the Jewish-Roman War of 66\u201373 AD that involved the destruction of Jerusalem.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Authors who have expressed support for this view include the Puritan author of ''Pilgrim's Progress'', John Bunyan, [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and [[Charles Finney]].\n\n====Amillennialism====\n{{Main|Amillennialism}}\n\nAmillennialists view the millennial rule of Christ as the current, but indefinite period that began with the foundation of the church and that will end with the Second Coming\u2014a period where Christ already reigns with his saints through the [[Eucharist]] and his church.  They view the life of the church as Christ's kingdom already established (inaugurated on the day of the [[Pentecost]] described in the first chapter of Acts), but not to be made complete until his second coming.  This framework precludes a literal interpretation of the thousand-year period mentioned in chapter twenty of Revelation, viewing the number \"thousand\" as [[Numerology|numerologically]] symbolic and pertaining to the current age of the church. Amillennialists generally do not use \"rapture\" as a theological term, but they do view a similar event coinciding with the second coming\u2014primarily as a mystical gathering with Christ. To amillennialists the final days already began on the day of the Pentecost, but that the great tribulation will occur during the final phase or conclusion of the millennium, with Christ then returning as the alpha and omega at the end of time.  Unlike premillennialists who predict the millennium as a literal thousand-year reign by Christ after his return, amillennialists emphasize the continuity and permanency of his reign throughout all periods of the New Covenant, past, present and future.  They do not regard mentions of Jerusalem in the chapter twenty-one of Revelation as pertaining to the present geographical city, but to a future [[new Jerusalem]] or \"new heaven and new earth\", for which the church through the twelve apostles (representing of the twelve tribes of Israel) currently lays the foundation in the messianic kingdom already present.  Unlike certain premillennial dispensationalists, they do not view the rebuilding of the temple of Jerusalem as either necessary or legitimate, because the practice of animal sacrifices has now been fulfilled in the life of the church through Christ's ultimate sacrifice on the cross.  Authors who have expressed support for the amillenialist view include St. Augustine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.catholic.com/tract/the-rapture |title= The Rapture |accessdate= 2017-09-19}}</ref>  The amillennialist viewpoint is the position held by the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Anglican]] churches, as well as mainline Protestant bodies, such as [[Lutherans]], [[Methodists]], [[Presbyterians]] and many [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] congregations.<ref name=\"Garrison\">{{cite book|last1=Garrison|first1=J.

Influences included the Bible Conference Movement, starting in 1878 with the Niagara Bible Conference. These conferences, which were initially inclusive of [[Historicism|historicist]] and [[Futurism|futurist]] premillennialism, led to an increasing acceptance of futurist premillennial views and the pre-tribulation rapture especially among Presbyterian, Baptist, and Congregational members.<ref name=\"r-Blaising-Bock-1993\"/> Popular books also contributed to acceptance of the pre-tribulation rapture, including [[William E.

Manuel Lacunza (1731\u20131801), a [[Jesuit]] priest (under the pseudonym Juan Josafat Ben Ezra), wrote an apocalyptic work entitled ''La venida del Mes\u00edas en gloria y majestad'' (''The Coming of the Messiah in Glory and Majesty'').

In 1830, she supposedly had a vision of the [[end time]]s which describes a post-tribulation view of the rapture that was first published in 1840. It was published again in 1861, but two important passages demonstrating a post-tribulation view were removed to encourage confusion concerning the timing of the rapture. The two removed segments were, \"This is the fiery trial which is to try us. - It will be for the purging and purifying of the real members of the body of Jesus\" and \"The trial of the Church is from Antichrist.

Lindsey proclaimed that the rapture was imminent, based on world conditions at the time.\n\nIn 1995, the doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture was further popularized by [[Tim LaHaye]]'s ''[[Left Behind]]'' series of books, which sold tens of millions of copies<ref name=\"booksite\">{{cite web |title= Left Behind Series - Official Website of the Book Series |url=http://www.leftbehind.com |publisher= [[Tyndale House]] |accessdate= 2015-03-23}}</ref> and was made into several movies and four real-time strategy video games.\n\n====Mid-tribulational premillennialism====\nThe mid-tribulation position espouses that the rapture will occur at some point in the middle of what is popularly called the tribulation period, or during Daniel's 70th Week. The tribulation is typically divided into two periods of 3.5 years each. Mid-tribulationists hold that the saints will go through the first period (Beginning of Travail), but will be raptured into Heaven before the severe outpouring of God's wrath in the second half of what is popularly called the great tribulation. Mid-tribulationists appeal to {{bible verse||Daniel|7:25|KJV}} which says the saints will be given over to tribulation for \"time, times, and half a time,\" - interpreted to mean 3.5 years. At the halfway point of the tribulation, the Antichrist will commit the \"abomination of desolation\" by desecrating the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem temple]].

This latter half of a seven-year period [i.e. 3 1/2 years] is defined as the great tribulation, although the exact duration is not known. References from Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21 are used as evidence that this tribulation will be cut short by the coming of Christ to deliver the righteous by means of the rapture, which will occur after specific events in Revelation, in particular after the sixth seal is opened and the sun is darkened and the moon is turned to blood.<ref>{{cite web|title= Welcome to the Pre-Wrath Consortium |website= Pre-Wrath Consortium |url= http://www.bibliology.org/PW |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20041020000043/http://bibliology.org/PW/ |archivedate= 2004-10-20}}</ref> However, by this point many Christians will have been slaughtered as martyrs by the [[Antichrist]].

According to them the great tribulation was already fulfilled in the Jewish-Roman War of 66\u201373 AD that involved the destruction of Jerusalem.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Authors who have expressed support for this view include the Puritan author of ''Pilgrim's Progress'', John Bunyan, [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and [[Charles Finney]].\n\n====Amillennialism====\n{{Main|Amillennialism}}\n\nAmillennialists view the millennial rule of Christ as the current, but indefinite period that began with the foundation of the church and that will end with the Second Coming\u2014a period where Christ already reigns with his saints through the [[Eucharist]] and his church.  They view the life of the church as Christ's kingdom already established (inaugurated on the day of the [[Pentecost]] described in the first chapter of Acts), but not to be made complete until his second coming.  This framework precludes a literal interpretation of the thousand-year period mentioned in chapter twenty of Revelation, viewing the number \"thousand\" as [[Numerology|numerologically]] symbolic and pertaining to the current age of the church. Amillennialists generally do not use \"rapture\" as a theological term, but they do view a similar event coinciding with the second coming\u2014primarily as a mystical gathering with Christ. To amillennialists the final days already began on the day of the Pentecost, but that the great tribulation will occur during the final phase or conclusion of the millennium, with Christ then returning as the alpha and omega at the end of time.  Unlike premillennialists who predict the millennium as a literal thousand-year reign by Christ after his return, amillennialists emphasize the continuity and permanency of his reign throughout all periods of the New Covenant, past, present and future.  They do not regard mentions of Jerusalem in the chapter twenty-one of Revelation as pertaining to the present geographical city, but to a future [[new Jerusalem]] or \"new heaven and new earth\", for which the church through the twelve apostles (representing of the twelve tribes of Israel) currently lays the foundation in the messianic kingdom already present.  Unlike certain premillennial dispensationalists, they do not view the rebuilding of the temple of Jerusalem as either necessary or legitimate, because the practice of animal sacrifices has now been fulfilled in the life of the church through Christ's ultimate sacrifice on the cross.  Authors who have expressed support for the amillenialist view include St. Augustine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.catholic.com/tract/the-rapture |title= The Rapture |accessdate= 2017-09-19}}</ref>  The amillennialist viewpoint is the position held by the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Anglican]] churches, as well as mainline Protestant bodies, such as [[Lutherans]], [[Methodists]], [[Presbyterians]] and many [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] congregations.<ref name=\"Garrison\">{{cite book|last1=Garrison|first1=J.
