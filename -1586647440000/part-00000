After getting exceptional hospitality in the ashram, he came to know about the divine cow Nandini. When a famine struck his kingdom he asks his counsel to get Nandini cow from [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]], which the later refuses.\n|-\n|3\n|Angry King Vishwarath reaches the ashram and tries to get the cow forcefully but failed. The humiliated king decides to gain divine power by doing [[Tapas (Indian religions)|tapasya]] and abdicates the throne for his son.\n|-\n|4\n|Vishwarath got the boon of various divine weapons from [[Brahma|Lord Brahma]]. He again reaches [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s [[ashram]] to capture Nandini but fails. He vows to gain more power by doing great penance to become a [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishi]].\n|-\n|5\n|Ayodhya King Sathyavrata anoints his son Harishchandra as the new King and decides to ascend heaven with his mortal body. However, his unnatural wishes got refuted by [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]. He tried to lure [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s son Satya to help him achieve his desires. An angry Satya curses Sathyavrata and makes him [[Trishanku]].\n|-\n|6\n|Vishwarath after severe penance and tapasya gained more powers and blessing of Mother Gayatri, Vishwarath the warrior became Vishwamitra the sage.\n|-\n|7\n|A dejected [[Trishanku]] approaches Vishwamitra to achieve his desires.

However, Narada later instigates him reminding the promise he made to Trishanku. Vishwamitra begins more penance to gain uninterrupted access to heaven. Knowing this Indra and other gods (on the advice of Brhaspati) decide to disrupt his [[tapasya]]. They create a celestial Mahashakti after uniting their powers. But he failed and Vishwamitra killed him with his divine powers.\n|-\n|10\n|[[Indra]] decides to disrupt Vishwamitra's penance by sending [[apsara]] Rambha to seduce him. But an angry Vishwamitra curses her and turned her into a rock. She regretted her actions and asked for forgiveness. He gave her the boon that in future she will be liberated by a Maharishi. After failing repeatedly, Indra decides to disrupt his tapasya himself and went to Vishwamitra disguising as a hungry brahmin. But Vishwamitra recognized him easily and still gave his divine food gained from penance. He embarrasses Indra for his malevolent deeds. A dejected and humiliated Indra leaves for heaven.\n|-\n|11\n|Upon advice of Brhaspati, Indra summons apsara [[Menaka|Meneka]] to seduce Vishwamitra. A reluctant Menaka agrees for the task.

He then asks Menaka to return back to heaven but Menaka refuses as she's in love with Vishwamitra too. Indra orders her to return as it'll be unnatural for a celestial being to spend time on earth. A year later Menaka gave birth to a daughter. Narada reminds Indra that Menaka hasn't returned to heaven. \n|-\n|14\n|Menaka finally confesses to Vishwamitra that she was sent on a mission by Indra and now as her task is complete she had to return. An angry and disheartened Vishwamitra abandons Menaka and his daughter and sets out to fulfill his vow to become a Maharishi. Menaka also ascended to heaven leaving their daughter behind. [[Rishi]] [[Kanva]] and his wife Gautami found the girl in the forest and adopted her. As a baby, she was surrounded by Shakunta birds ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924, \u015bakunta). Therefore, he named her Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0932\u093e), meaning Shakunta-protected.\n|-\n|15\n|King [[Dushyanta]] arrives in Rishi Kanva's ashram and fell in love with Shakuntala.\n|-\n|16\n|Shakuntala and Dushyant's love blossoms.\n|-\n|17\n|Dushyant proposes Shakuntala for marriage and they have a [[gandharva]] marriage. Having to leave after some time, Dushyant gives Shakuntala a royal ring as a sign of their love, promising her that he will come to her. One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.\n|-\n|18\n|Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance. Her friends decide not to tell her anything about the curse. Shakuntala got pregnant and Rishi Kanva decides to send her to Dushyanta. \n|-\n|19\n|So, Shakuntala sets off to the capital, [[Hastinapur]], to remind Dushyant of their past love. Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.\n|-\n|20\n|Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity. \n|-\n|21\n|To assess Harishchandra's commitment towards truthfulness, Vishwamitra reaches his court and asks for an unusually huge amount of treasure for yajna purpose which the King readily accepts. Even upon insistence from the King and his counsel, Vishwamitra refuses to take the treasure at once and asks the king to set aside the treasure with himself and he will take it when the right time arrives. Later, Viswamitra creates and send wild animals to Harishchandra's kingdom to further test his mettle. Harishchandra saves his subject from wild animals.\n|-\n|22\n|Using his powers, Vishwamitra creates two Matangi girls and send them to seduce Raja Harishchandra. The girls are not able to seduce Harishchandra. He is rather disgusted with their seductive performance and asked them to leave with some rewards. But the girls refused to take any reward and in turn ask the King to marry them. Harishchandra refuses to marry them as he is already married to Taramati. The girls then offered themselves as concubines which he vehemently refuses. Later a furious Vishwamitra arrives in Harishchandra's court over the rejection of his magical daughters. Even after the strong insistence of Vishwamitra, Harishchandra refuses to marry his daughters and decides to relinquish his kingdom for saving dharma. He hands over his entire kingdom to Vishwamitra but when he prepares to leaves for Kashi with his wife and son, Vishwamitra asks for the money promised to him for yajna purpose. Harishchandra asks for a month's time to fulfill the promise. Vishwamitra sends his disciple Nakshatrik to accompany them.\n|-\n|23\n|On his journey to Kashi, Vishwamitra creates many hurdles to deviate Harishchandra from dharma. He creates Mayamuni to misguide Harishchandra from the correct path. Vishwamitra's disciple Nakshatrik also keeps giving a hard time to Harishchandra throughout his journey. Vishwamitra creates a Betaal to scare Harishchandra and his family at night but Harishchandra kills him in a duel. Finally, they reach Kashi and Nakshatrik asks for the promised money. Unable to pay anything, Harishchandra asks for some time but Nakshatrik gives him the choice to back-out from his words as there is no way he can deliver his commitment. Taramati asks his husband to sell her off as a slave so that he can pay the money to Vishwamitra. A reluctant Harishchandra agrees for it.\n|-\n|24\n|A rich brahmin named Kaalkaushik buys Taramati & her son (named Rohita) and gave the asked money to Nakshatrik. But Vishwamitra refuses the money and gives it to Nakshatrik as his wages. Vishwamitra asks his disciple to rigorously test Harishchandra's commitment to dharma. Nakshatrik goes to Harishchandra and asks for his guru's debt. A shocked Harishchandra decides this time to sell himself.\n|-\n|25\n|A rich drunkard ''chandala'' named Veerbahu buys Harishchandra and renames him Veerdas. He deploys him as dom (untouchable) to perform last rites rituals at Ganga Ghat. Veerbahu instructs him to charge a gold coin, a new cloth, and rice for anyone coming for the last rites ritual. While Harishchandra is busy working as a dom, his wife and son face a lot of hardship at their master's place because of his cruel wife.\n|-\n|26\n|Taramati's master sends Rohita to the forest along with others for daily chores. Vishwamitra sends Nagraj as a snake to kill Rohita. He dies in the forest due to snake-bite and his corpse is later discovered by Taramati. Heart-broken Taramati takes the corpse of his son for cremation where she's stopped by none other than his own husband Harishchandra. They are not able to recognize each other initially. As per his master's instruction, he can't let anyone do the last rites without the pre-requisite items. Taramati identifies his husband. A mournful Harishchandra still sticks to his dharma and tells his wife to get the items for cremation. Taramati asks her husband to guard their son's corpse while she leaves to get the items from her master.\n|-\n|27\n|Vishwamitra creates another creature to kill a young prince and set-up Taramati who found the dead prince on her way to her master. The King orders to execute Taramati and she's taken to Veerbahu for execution. Veerbahu orders Veerdas to follow orders and behead Taramati as per the King's justice. Following his dharma, Harishchandra was about to behead his wife when Vishwamitra appears and stops him. He again offered his entire kingdom back if he agrees to marry his Matangi daughters. Harishchandra refuses again and following his master's order swing the sword to behead Taramati but the sword turns into a garland. Vishwamitra then concedes his plans to Harishchandra. He revealed that Taramati's master Kaalkaushik and his wife were [[Shiva]]-[[Parvati]] themselves. Veerbahu was none other than [[Yama|Yamaraj]]. Vashishtha also appears and appreciates Harishchandra's commitment towards his dharma. Vishwamitra discloses that he was examining Harishchandra's integrity to send a message to the gods who claimed to be superior to human beings. His grand-plan was to prove that human kind is far superior to even gods and Harishchandra had proved it.\n|}\n\n== Music ==\nLyrics for various songs were written by Bhring Tupkari and music was composed by Vasu Rao.
