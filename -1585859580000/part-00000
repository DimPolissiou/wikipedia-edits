One-act plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a set of short pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the plays as vehicles for them both.\n\n''The Astonished Heart'' depicts a leading psychiatrist falling passionately in love with an old friend of his wife. She has wilfully led him on but is unprepared for the disastrous effect on him. Increasingly desperate, he watches his own mind lose control of itself, and he finally kills himself. The title is taken from ''[[Deuteronomy]]'': \"the Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart\".\n\nThe cycle was first produced in 1935 in [[Manchester]] and then toured for nine weeks before opening in London (1936) and New York (1936\u201337).{{refn|One of the ten plays, ''[[Star Chamber (play)|Star Chamber]]'', was given one performance and immediately dropped; it is seldom revived, and throughout Coward's lifetime the published texts of the cycle omitted it.<ref>Morley (1999), p. xii</ref>|group=n}} It has been revived occasionally and has been adapted for film, television and radio.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre and wrote several early in his career.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 25\u201327 and 52</ref> He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2005), p. 66</ref> In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer [[Philip Hoare]] describes it as \"a bold idea, risky and innovative\".<ref>Hoare, p. 268</ref>\n\nThe actress most closely associated with Coward was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], his oldest friend, with whom he had first acted as a child in ''[[The Assumption of Hannele|Hannele]]'' in 1913.<ref>Hoare, pp. 27, 30 and 51</ref> They starred together in his revue ''[[London Calling!]]'' (1923) and his comedy ''[[Private Lives]]'' (1930\u201331),<ref>Morley, (1999), p. viii; and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 209 and 217</ref> and he wrote the ''Tonight at 8.30'' plays \"as acting, singing and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\".<ref>''Quoted'' in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283</ref> Coward directed the plays as well as acting in them. They were performed in various combinations of three.{{refn|The programme of plays chosen for each performance was advertised in advance.<ref>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 January 1936, p. 10; 11 February 1936, p. 12; 2 March 1936, p. 12; 6 April 1936, p. 10; 2 May 1936, p. 12; 10 June 1936, p. 14.</ref>|group=n}} Coward loved playing in some of the other plays in ''Tonight at 8.30'', particularly ''[[Fumed Oak]]'' and ''[[Red Peppers]]'', but \"I hated playing ''The Astonished Heart''. It depressed me.\"<ref>Castle, p. 139</ref>\n\n''The Astonished Heart'' was first presented on 15 October 1935 at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House, Manchester]], the second play in a programme that began with ''[[We Were Dancing]]'' and ended with ''Red Peppers''.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, p. 282</ref> The first London performance was on 9 January 1936 at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]].<ref name=times>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 19 January 1936, p. 15.</ref> The cycle played to full houses, and the limited season closed on 20 June, after 157 performances.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 192</ref>{{refn|The London run was interrupted by Lawrence's illness caused by overwork, as she was also shooting a film at the time.

Along with Chris's secretary, Susan, and his assistant, Tim, Barbara is waiting for the arrival of Leonora Vail. Sir Reginald French, a surgeon, enters from a bedroom, asking if Leonora has come yet. Barbara asks, \"There isn't much time, is there?\" The doctor replies that he fears not, and that his patient is asking for Leonora in his moments of consciousness. The doorbell rings. Barbara comments \"It's the same \u2013 exactly the same as a year ago ... the first time she ever came into this room\". Ernest, the butler announces Mrs Vail; the lights fade and come up again on the second scene, which is a flashback to November 1934.\n\nBarbara, Tim, Susan and Ernest are all in the same positions, though with minor changes of costume. Leonora, an old school friend of Barbara, enters. When Chris looks in for a few moments, his manner to Leonora is vague and uninterested. Leonora tells Barbara that she much prefers his nice assistant, Tim. She leaves, after inviting Barbara, Tim and Chris (\"if he'll come\") to lunch. Tim comes in, looking for a Bible: Chris wants a quotation for his next lecture on psychopathology. They borrow the cook's Bible and find the passage he wants: \"The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of the heart.\"\n\nIn the third scene, two months later, Chris and Leonora have become considerably more intimate: they are kissing each other passionately. Leonora confesses that she has deliberately tried to make him fall in love, in revenge for his dismissive manner at their first meeting. He admits that he was deliberately rude to her at first because \"You irritated me, you were so conscious of how beautiful you looked\". He adds that despite his affair with Leonora he loves Barbara \"deeply and truly and for ever\". The scene ends with another passionate clinch.\n\nThree months later, scene four takes place on an early April morning. Barbara has been sitting up all night, waiting for Chris to come home. She greets him calmly but insists on some straight talking. She tells him that his increasingly unhinged mental state, brought on by the strain of his affair, is affecting his work and his life. She says he should go away with Leonora for two or three months, leaving Tim to run the practice. In the fifth scene, in November, Chris and Leonora quarrel bitterly. She says she is leaving him. He throws her to the floor. After she picks herself up and leaves, he drinks two glasses of whisky, goes to the window and jumps out.\n\nThe final scene is a continuation of the first. Ernest announces: \"Mrs Vail.\" Barbara gives her a quick drink and sends her straight into the bedroom. The others wait, talking distractedly, until she comes back. Barbara asks, \"Is he \u2013 ?\" Leonora replies, \"Yes. ... He didn't know me; he thought I was you; he said \u2013 'Baba, I'm not submerged any more' \u2013 and then he said 'Baba' again \u2013 and then \u2013 then he died.\" She leaves the room as the curtain falls.\n:Source: Play text and Mander and Mitchenson.<ref>Coward, pp. 7\u201311 (Scene 1); 11\u201322 (Scene 2); 22\u201327 (Scene 3); 28\u201335 (Scene 4); 36\u201341 (Scene 5) and 41\u201343 (Scene 6); and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 291\u2013293</ref>\n\n==Subsequent productions==\nIn 1937 a company headed by [[Estelle Winwood]] and [[Robert Henderson (actor)| Robert Henderson]] toured the ''Tonight at 8.30'' cycle in the US and Canada.

It is as if their very familiarity allows them to creep up and take you by surprise.

One-act plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a set of short pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the plays as vehicles for them both.\n\n''The Astonished Heart'' depicts a leading psychiatrist falling passionately in love with an old friend of his wife. She has wilfully led him on but is unprepared for the disastrous effect on him. Increasingly desperate, he watches his own mind lose control of itself, and he finally kills himself. The title is taken from ''[[Deuteronomy]]'': \"the Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart\".\n\nThe cycle was first produced in 1935 in [[Manchester]] and then toured for nine weeks before opening in London (1936) and New York (1936\u201337).{{refn|One of the ten plays, ''[[Star Chamber (play)|Star Chamber]]'', was given one performance and immediately dropped; it is seldom revived, and throughout Coward's lifetime the published texts of the cycle omitted it.<ref>Morley (1999), p. xii</ref>|group=n}} It has been revived occasionally and has been adapted for film, television and radio.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre and wrote several early in his career.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 25\u201327 and 52</ref> He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2005), p. 66</ref> In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer [[Philip Hoare]] describes it as \"a bold idea, risky and innovative\".<ref>Hoare, p. 268</ref>\n\nThe actress most closely associated with Coward was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], his oldest friend, with whom he had first acted as a child in ''[[The Assumption of Hannele|Hannele]]'' in 1913.<ref>Hoare, pp. 27, 30 and 51</ref> They starred together in his revue ''[[London Calling!]]'' (1923) and his comedy ''[[Private Lives]]'' (1930\u201331),<ref>Morley, (1999), p. viii; and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 209 and 217</ref> and he wrote the ''Tonight at 8.30'' plays \"as acting, singing and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\".<ref>''Quoted'' in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283</ref> Coward directed the plays as well as acting in them. They were performed in various combinations of three.{{refn|The programme of plays chosen for each performance was advertised in advance.<ref>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 January 1936, p. 10; 11 February 1936, p. 12; 2 March 1936, p. 12; 6 April 1936, p. 10; 2 May 1936, p. 12; 10 June 1936, p. 14.</ref>|group=n}} Coward loved playing in some of the other plays in ''Tonight at 8.30'', particularly ''[[Fumed Oak]]'' and ''[[Red Peppers]]'', but \"I hated playing ''The Astonished Heart''. It depressed me.\"<ref>Castle, p. 139</ref>\n\n''The Astonished Heart'' was first presented on 15 October 1935 at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House, Manchester]], the  play in a programme that began with ''[[We Were Dancing]]'' and ended with ''Red Peppers''.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, p. 282</ref> The first London performance was on 9 January 1936 at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]].<ref name=times>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 19 January 1936, p. 15.</ref> The cycle played to full houses, and the limited season closed on 20 June, after 157 performances.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 192</ref>{{refn|The London run was interrupted by Lawrence's illness caused by overwork, as she was also shooting a film at the time.

Along with Chris's secretary, Susan, and his assistant, Tim, Barbara is waiting for the arrival of Leonora Vail. Sir Reginald French, a surgeon, enters from a bedroom, asking if Leonora has come yet. Barbara asks, \"There isn't much time, is there?\" The doctor replies that he fears not, and that his patient is asking for Leonora in his moments of consciousness. The doorbell rings. Barbara comments \"It's the same \u2013 exactly the same as a year ago ... the first time she ever came into this room\". Ernest, the butler announces Mrs Vail; the lights fade and come up again on the second scene, which is a flashback to November 1934.\n\nBarbara, Tim, Susan and Ernest are all in the same positions, though with minor changes of costume. Leonora, an old school friend of Barbara, enters. When Chris looks in for a few moments, his manner to Leonora is vague and uninterested. Leonora tells Barbara that she much prefers his nice assistant, Tim. She leaves, after inviting Barbara, Tim and Chris (\"if he'll come\") to lunch. Tim comes in, looking for a Bible: Chris wants a quotation for his next lecture on psychopathology. They borrow the cook's Bible and find the passage he wants: \"The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of the heart.\"\n\nIn the third scene, two months later, Chris and Leonora have become considerably more intimate: they are kissing each other passionately. Leonora confesses that she has deliberately tried to make him fall in love, in revenge for his dismissive manner at their first meeting. He admits that he was deliberately rude to her at first because \"You irritated me, you were so conscious of how beautiful you looked\". He adds that despite his affair with Leonora he loves Barbara \"deeply and truly and for ever\". The scene ends with another passionate clinch.\n\nThree months later, scene four takes place on an early April morning. Barbara has been sitting up all night, waiting for Chris to come home. She greets him calmly but insists on some straight talking. She tells him that his increasingly unhinged mental state, brought on by the strain of his affair, is affecting his work and his life. She says he should go away with Leonora for two or three months, leaving Tim to run the practice. In the fifth scene, in November, Chris and Leonora quarrel bitterly. She says she is leaving him. He throws her to the floor. After she picks herself up and leaves, he drinks two glasses of whisky, goes to the window and jumps out.\n\nThe final scene is a continuation of the first. Ernest announces: \"Mrs Vail.\" Barbara gives her a quick drink and sends her straight into the bedroom. The others wait, talking distractedly, until she comes back. Barbara asks, \"Is he \u2013 ?\" Leonora replies, \"Yes. ... He didn't know me; he thought I was you; he said \u2013 'Baba, I'm not submerged any more' \u2013 and then he said 'Baba' again \u2013 and then \u2013 then he died.\" She leaves the room as the curtain falls.\n:Source: Play text and Mander and Mitchenson.<ref>Coward, pp. 7\u201311 (Scene 1); 11\u201322 (Scene 2); 22\u201327 (Scene 3); 28\u201335 (Scene 4); 36\u201341 (Scene 5) and 41\u201343 (Scene 6); and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 291\u2013293</ref>\n\n==Subsequent productions==\nIn 1937 a company headed by [[Estelle Winwood]] and [[Robert Henderson (actor)| Robert Henderson]] toured the ''Tonight at 8.30'' cycle in the US and Canada.

It is as if their very familiarity allows them to creep up and take you by surprise. Maybe it is because Coward understood the heart so very well, and ensured that underneath the brittle surfaces of these pieces is a well of passion and desire\".<ref>Gardner, Lynn.

In 2014, to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of The Great War, the orchestra presented ''When This Lousy War is Over'' which reflected a range of attitudes from the time; patriotic, pacifist and feminist, and drew from gipsy music, music hall, soldiers' songs and even a song from the then radical avante-garde Cabaret Voltaire in neutral Switzerland.<ref>http://www.ukuleleorchestra.com/index.php/blog/2014/10/26/press-release-when-this-lousy-war-is-over-2/</ref>\n\n==BBC Proms world record==\nOn Tuesday 18 August 2009 the UOGB performed in a late night prom in the [[Proms#2009 season|BBC Proms 2009 Season]] at the Royal Albert Hall.
