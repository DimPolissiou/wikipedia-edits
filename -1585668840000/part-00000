It provides a primary reinforcement capability for the regular service, and consists of paid volunteers who give up some of their weekends, evenings and holidays to train at one of a number of [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s around the [[United Kingdom]]. Its current mission is to provide trained personnel in support of the regular RAF. Queen Elizabeth II is Air Commodore-in-Chief of the RAuxAF.\n\n==Formation==\nThe Royal Auxiliary Air Force owes its origin to Lord [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Trenchard]]'s vision of an elite corps of civilians who would serve their country in flying squadrons in their spare time. Instituted by [[Order in Council]] on 9 October 1924, the first Auxiliary Air Force squadrons were formed the following year. The pilots of AAF squadrons were generally formed from the wealthier classes, as applicants were expected to already have, or be prepared to obtain, their [[Private pilot licence|pilot's licence]] at their own expense, at a cost of \u00a396, about \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|96|1925|r=-3}}}} today.<ref name=\"Flight1925\">{{cite journal |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1925/1925%20-%200663.html |title=Auxiliary Air Force |issue=876 |volume=XVII |pages=663\u2013664 |journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |date=8 October 1925 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref> The [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve|Royal Air Force Reserve]] (RAFR) differs in that its members were trained in the RAF and left, but are obliged to return to service if required.<ref>{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=Bishop |title=Fighter Boys |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2003 |isbn=9780002571692}}</ref> Pilots of the AAF were expected to join for a period of no less than five years, and were required to fly a few hours every quarter and attend annual training for 15 days. Each squadron was provided with a town base for training, and facilities at an aerodrome.<ref name=\"Flight1925\"/> All serving members were required to wear the letter A on their uniforms.\n\n==Second World War==\n[[Image:An engine fitter watches the CO of No. 504 Squadron, Squadron Leader R. Lewis, in his Spitfire Mk VC at Middle Wallop, December 1942. CH8010.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A No. 504 (County of Nottingham) Squadron [[Supermarine Spitfire]] during WWII.]]\nBy March 1939, 21 flying squadrons had been formed, the 20 surviving units being 'embodied' (included) with the [[Royal Air Force]] at the outbreak of war.  Notably, all enlisted men continued to serve under their auxiliary conditions of service until they expired when they were required to transfer to the RAFVR. The squadrons were equipped with a variety of operational aircraft which included [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]]. The squadrons scored a number of notable successes before and during the [[Second World War]]: the first flight over [[Mount Everest]], undertaken by auxiliary pilots from 602 Squadron, the first [[Nazi Germany|German]] aircraft destroyed over British territorial waters \u2013 and over the mainland, the first [[U-boat]] to be destroyed with the aid of airborne [[radar]], the first kill of a [[V-1 flying bomb]]; the first to be equipped with jet-powered aircraft, and the highest score of any British [[night fighter]] squadron. In the [[Battle of Britain]], the AAF provided 14 of the 62 Squadrons in [[RAF Fighter Command]]'s Order of Battle and accounted for approximately 30% of the accredited enemy kills. Indeed, in 11 Group Fighter Command, that saw the heaviest fighting over South East England in 1940, of the 15 top scoring squadrons, eight were auxiliary.  The losses sustained during the Battle of Britain, as with all other squadrons, were replaced by drafting in regular and RAFVR pilots.  In fact, the volunteer reserves of the RAF outnumbered the regular RAF pilots in the Battle of Britain.\n\nThe Tactical Air Force squadrons were chosen to carry out several successful ultra low-level raids on key 'pin-point' targets in occupied Europe. The Balloon Squadrons also played their part, downing and deterring many hostile aircraft, and were accredited with the destruction of 279 V-1 flying bombs.\n\nThe Auxiliary Air Force was also responsible for the anti-aircraft balloon defences of the UK. At the outbreak of war in 1939 there were about 42 Squadrons operating [[barrage balloons]], with the number of squadrons peaking at about 102 in 1944.\n\n==Cold War==\nThese achievements were honoured by the prefix \"Royal\", conferred by [[King George VI]] in 1947. Twenty of the pre-war squadrons were reformed postwar as fighter units. Events after the Second World War heralded a time of great danger for the UK. The onset of the [[Cold War]] with the [[Communist Bloc]] leading to the [[Berlin Air Lift]] and ultimately the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950. During these crises the RAuxAF fighter squadrons, the five newly formed Air Observation Post (AOP) squadrons and other RAuxAF units, played their part in the UK's air defence and participated in many [[NATO]] air exercises. In 1951, at the height of the Korean War, all 20 RAuxAF fighter squadrons (representing one third of Fighter Command strength) were called up for three months full-time service; they were required for home defence in place of regular squadrons earmarked for deployment to Korea. In the event RAF fighter squadrons were not needed in Korea, but the RAuxAF squadrons were retained for intensive refresher training at their home bases.\n\nThe 10 March 1957 saw the disbandment of all 20 RAuxAF fighter squadrons, the five post-war AOP squadrons and the Light Anti-Aircraft ground-based squadrons of the [[RAF Regiment|Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment]].  In the following two years or so, the Auxiliary Fighter Control Units associated with them were also disbanded.  On 16 March 1960, the [[Air Commodore-in-Chief]] and His Royal Highness [[Prince Philip]], [[Duke of Edinburgh]], invited the Squadron Commanders and Flight Commanders of all the disbanded Royal Auxiliary Air Force units to a Reception at [[Buckingham Palace]]. All were given the following letter from the Air Commodore-in-Chief:\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  =\n[[Buckingham Palace|BUCKINGHAM PALACE]]\n\nI have welcomed this opportunity of taking leave of the Commanding Officers and senior Auxiliary officers of the squadrons of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force which are being disbanded and of sending through them this message of appreciation and thanks to all their officers, airmen and airwomen.\n\nThe history of the Auxiliary Air Force has been a glorious one.  The first Auxiliary squadrons were included in the Air Defence of Great Britain in 1925.  By the outbreak of war in 1939 the Auxiliary fighter, coastal and balloon squadrons formed an integral and vital part of our forces.  It was aircraft of these squadrons which shot down the first enemy bomber over this country; and Auxiliary squadrons were heavily engaged in the air over Dunkirk and throughout the Battle of Britain.  Later they were to win battle honours over the Atlantic, in Malta, North Africa, Sicily and Italy, the Arakan and Burma, and in Normandy, France and Germany.\n\nAfter the war, the fighter squadrons were reconstituted as the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the traditional spirit of voluntary service found new outlets with the formation of Regiment, Air OP, Fighter Control and Radar reporting Units, some of which are to remain in being and provide further opportunities for voluntary service.\n\nThe association of the Force with my family has always been close.  I was proud to become Honorary Air Commodore of Nos 603, 2603 and 3603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadrons in 1951 and to succeed my father as Honorary Air Commodore-in-Chief of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force in 1952.  Members of my family have always treasured their association with Auxiliary squadrons as Honorary Air Commodores.\n\nI wish as Air Commodore-in-Chief to thank officers, airmen and airwomen of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force for all that they have given to the service of the country by their enthusiasm, their spirit and their devotion to duty in peace and war.  It is a sad day when it is necessary to tell so many that it is no longer possible to use their services on the duties they have assumed so willingly.  I wish them to know that they can look back with pride and satisfaction to service well done.\n\n16 March 1957\n\nElizabeth R\n|quoted = 1\n}}\n\nThe renaissance of the RAuxAF began in 1959 with the formation of three Maritime Headquarters Units and one Maritime Support Unit.  The MSU in Belfast was short-lived, but No 1 (County of Hertford) MHU in Northwood, No 2 (City of Edinburgh) MHU in Edinburgh and No 3 (County of Devon) MHU in Mountbatten continued in existence until No 3 was amalgamated into No 1 in 1999.  Later that year No 1 was renumbered 600 (City of London) Squadron and No 2 was renumbered 603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadron.  These three units formed the entirety of the RAuxAF for twenty years until expansion starting in 1979, with the formation of three Regiment Field Squadrons, continuing with a Movements Squadron in 1982, and, following lessons learned during the [[Falklands War|Falklands conflict]], an Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron in 1983. A later addition, in 1987, was an auxiliary element (The Grampian Troop) formed within a regular RAF Regiment [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier]] Air Defence Squadron. Another step forward was taken in 1986, with the raising of four Defence Force Flights with the role of ground defence of key points on air bases. In 1984, the RAuxAF's [[Diamond Jubilee]] was marked by the award to the Service of its own badge, which forms the basic motif of the Sovereign's Colour for the Royal Auxiliary Force presented by Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] in 1989. The words of the badge motto are ''COMITAMUR AD ASTRA'' \u2013 Latin \"We go with them to the stars\".\n\n==Gulf War and beyond==\nDuring the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, the Aeromedical and Movements Squadrons were mobilised and performed with great distinction in theatre and at other locations in the UK and overseas.\n\n[[File:2623 Troops shooting.jpg|left|2623sqn RAuxAF Regiment Shooting [[General purpose machine gun|GPMG]] on range|thumb]]\n\nOn 5 April 1997, all of the four war-appointable flights of the then [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] were fully amalgamated into the [[RAuxAF]], each with squadron status. In recognition of their origins, and in the absence of direct county or city territorial affiliations, they were each given the honour of retaining the letters \"VR\" within their squadron titles. The remaining non-active support elements of the RAFVR were and remain unaffected by this amalgamation, namely the [[RAFVR(T)]], the [[University Air Squadron|RAFVR(UAS)]], and at its point of formation, the [[Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme|RAFVR(DTUS)]] (being the branches for Training, University Air Squadron, and the Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme, respectively).\n\n[[File:Standard_presentation_2622sqn.jpg|thumb|upright|The 2622sqn RAuxAF Regiment standard is presented to an officer on 30 September 2006]]\n\nDuring 2003 the RAuxAF was involved in the first large-scale mobilisation for over 50 years.

and south coast underground and introduce into service more advanced radars.  However, manning difficulties in the immediate post-war regular RAF led to a number of Fighter Control and Radar Reporting units of the RAuxAF being formed, from 1948 onwards. In the early and uncertain days of the [[Cold War]], the Fighter Control and Radar Reporting units were largely responsible for manning the entire UK Control and Reporting system.  All were disbanded by 1961.

In the event, 12 were formed in the Light Anti-Aircraft role, equipped with 40mm anti-aircraft guns and attached to the RAuxAF flying squadrons.  By 1955, due to the introduction into service of more sophisticated weapons, the squadrons were converted to Regiment Field Squadrons.  All 12 squadrons were disbanded, along with the flying squadrons, in 1957.  However, three new field squadrons were re-formed in 1979, followed by two more in 1982 and a sixth in 1983.  Since then, two have been disbanded and two have been re-roled. In addition, No 1339 Wing was formed in 1085 and consisted of 2729 and 2890 (both City of Lincoln Squadrons,) equipped with Skyguard Raddar and Oerlikon guns both captured from the Argentians during the 1982 Falklands War Both squadrons were disbanded in 1994 to become the Rapier Cadreisation Unit and then No 27 and 48 Squadrons RAF Regiment.\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*2501 (County of Gloucester)\n*2502 (Ulster)\n*2503 (County of Lincoln)*\n*2504 (County of Nottingham)\n*2600 (City of London)\n*2602 (City of Glasgow)\n*2603 (City of Edinburgh\n*2605 (County of Warwick)\n*2608 (North Riding of Yorkshire)\n{{Col-break}}\n*2609 (West Riding of Yorkshire)\n*2611 (West Lancashire)\n*2612 (County of Aberdeen)\n*2620 (County of Norfolk)*\n*2622 (Highland)*\n*2623 (East Anglian)*\n*2625 (County of Cornwall)\n*2729 (City of Lincoln)\n*2890 (City of Lincoln)\n{{col-end}}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> denotes current active squadrons\n\nRegiment Squadrons took the number of their parent flying squadron, prefixed with 2.

At the time, the Cold War was still in progress and the Soviet Union was regarded as a considerable threat to UK bases. So a plan was created to develop a system of ground defence for the vital bases without extending regular forces and for a modest outlay. As the Royal Auxiliary Air Force had already been revived in 1979 to provide aeromedical evacuation services, air movements and Regiment Field squadrons, it was planned to set up the Defence Force flights and task one of them to protect RAF Lyneham, home of the UK's air transport squadrons.\n\nVolunteers between 18 and 50 were sought within a radius of 50 miles of Lyneham and the first training flight came into being in late 1986, under the command of Flt Lt Bryan Tovey, a retired RAF Squadron Leader. Within five years, over 100 volunteers attended Lyneham on Wednesday evenings and weekends, trained in all the essential field combat skills such as weapons handling and live-firing practice, fieldcraft, perimeter defence, fighting in built up areas, reconnaissance, intelligence-gathering, fire-fighting and rescue techniques plus nuclear, biological and chemical monitoring. Battlefield skills were regularly tested at military training areas and such was the reputation built-up by the Lyneham Defence Force that their personnel were once used to assist regular special forces in training scenarios. The Defence Force field sections and Combined Incident Teams were based with the [[RAF Regiment]] contingent at Lyneham and played a full part in the station's Tactical Evaluation tests, conducted by NATO examiners.  In the final TacEval before the Defence Force was stood down, Lyneham received outstanding marks and its Station Commander particularly thanked the Auxiliaries for their contribution. Such performance did not go unnoticed in the wider air force and in 1993, the Lyneham DF was awarded the Robins Trophy as the outstanding RAuxAF unit of the year.  The trophy was presented by the RAuxAF Inspector General at a ceremony at Lyneham in 1994.\n\n=== The Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) ===\n\nThe foundations of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force were laid by the [[Women's Royal Air Force (World War I)|Women's Royal Air Force]] (WRAF) which was formed early in 1918, but, although plans were formulated for the continual employment of women with the RAF in peacetime, they had to be abandoned on account of the drastic post-war economy and by April 1920, the disbandment of the WRAF was complete.\n\nWhen the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) came into being in September 1938, it contained separate RAF companies, but following the [[Munich Crisis|Munich crisis]] of 1938, it became apparent that these companies should be brought more closely under RAF control.  Accordingly, the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF) was constituted by Royal Warrant on 28 June 1939.\n\nInitially, recruiting was limited to officers and NCOs only, recruiting for the original RAF companies being undertaken by the AAF.  However, with the coming of the Second World War, airwomen were to join the ranks and, by mid 1943, there were 182,000 women serving in the WAAF, in all the RAF trade groups.  In common with the AAF, the women's force became less 'auxiliary' as the war went on; but on the outbreak of war, the WAAF consisted of 234 officers and 1500 airwomen, all of whom could be considered pre-war volunteers in the true auxiliary mould.\n\nInitially, entry was confined to the few service trades then open to women, namely MT Driver, Equipment Assistant, Cook, Clerk and Mess and Kitchen Staff.  A small number of fabric workers were also employed.  By August 1939, additional trades were authorised: Teleprinter Operators, Telephone Operators and Plotters. Without the services of the WAAF, the RAF would have required an additional 150,000 airmen who could not have been obtained as easily as the women and who could only be provided at the expense of other Services or production.  The success of the women's Service is all the more remarkable in view of the prejudice against employing women that undoubtedly existed at the beginning of the war.\n\n===Barrage Balloon Organisation of the Auxiliary Air Force===\n{{main|Barrage Balloon Organisations of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]]\n* [[Reserve Forces and Cadets Association]]\n* [[RAF Balloon Command]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Halley, James J.

It provides a primary reinforcement capability for the regular service, and consists of paid volunteers who give up some of their weekends, evenings and holidays to train at one of a number of [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s around the [[United Kingdom]]. Its current mission is to provide trained personnel in support of the regular RAF. Queen Elizabeth II is Air Commodore-in-Chief of the RAuxAF.\n\n==Formation==\nThe Royal Auxiliary Air Force owes its origin to Lord [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Trenchard]]'s vision of an elite corps of civilians who would serve their country in flying squadrons in their spare time. Instituted by [[Order in Council]] on 9 October 1924, the first Auxiliary Air Force squadrons were formed the following year. The pilots of AAF squadrons were generally formed from the wealthier classes, as applicants were expected to already have, or be prepared to obtain, their [[Private pilot licence|pilot's licence]] at their own expense, at a cost of \u00a396, about \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|96|1925|r=-3}}}} today.<ref name=\"Flight1925\">{{cite journal |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1925/1925%20-%200663.html |title=Auxiliary Air Force |issue=876 |volume=XVII |pages=663\u2013664 |journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |date=8 October 1925 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref> The [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve|Royal Air Force Reserve]] (RAFR) differs in that its members were trained in the RAF and left, but are obliged to return to service if required.<ref>{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=Bishop |title=Fighter Boys |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2003 |isbn=9780002571692}}</ref> Pilots of the AAF were expected to join for a period of no less than five years, and were required to fly a few hours every quarter and attend annual training for 15 days. Each squadron was provided with a town base for training, and facilities at an aerodrome.<ref name=\"Flight1925\"/> All serving members were required to wear the letter A on their uniforms.\n\n==Second World War==\n[[Image:An engine fitter watches the CO of No. 504 Squadron, Squadron Leader R. Lewis, in his Spitfire Mk VC at Middle Wallop, December 1942. CH8010.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A No. 504 (County of Nottingham) Squadron [[Supermarine Spitfire]] during WWII.]]\nBy March 1939, 21 flying squadrons had been formed, the 20 surviving units being 'embodied' (included) with the [[Royal Air Force]] at the outbreak of war.  Notably, all enlisted men continued to serve under their auxiliary conditions of service until they expired when they were required to transfer to the RAFVR. The squadrons were equipped with a variety of operational aircraft which included [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]]. The squadrons scored a number of notable successes before and during the [[Second World War]]: the first flight over [[Mount Everest]], undertaken by auxiliary pilots from 602 Squadron, the first [[Nazi Germany|German]] aircraft destroyed over British territorial waters \u2013 and over the mainland, the first [[U-boat]] to be destroyed with the aid of airborne [[radar]], the first kill of a [[V-1 flying bomb]]; the first to be equipped with jet-powered aircraft, and the highest score of any British [[night fighter]] squadron. In the [[Battle of Britain]], the AAF provided 14 of the 62 Squadrons in [[RAF Fighter Command]]'s Order of Battle and accounted for approximately 30% of the accredited enemy kills. Indeed, in 11 Group Fighter Command, that saw the heaviest fighting over South East England in 1940, of the 15 top scoring squadrons, eight were auxiliary.  The losses sustained during the Battle of Britain, as with all other squadrons, were replaced by drafting in regular and RAFVR pilots.  In fact, the volunteer reserves of the RAF outnumbered the regular RAF pilots in the Battle of Britain.\n\nThe Tactical Air Force squadrons were chosen to carry out several successful ultra low-level raids on key 'pin-point' targets in occupied Europe. The Balloon Squadrons also played their part, downing and deterring many hostile aircraft, and were accredited with the destruction of 279 V-1 flying bombs.\n\nThe Auxiliary Air Force was also responsible for the anti-aircraft balloon defences of the UK. At the outbreak of war in 1939 there were about 42 Squadrons operating [[barrage balloons]], with the number of squadrons peaking at about 102 in 1944.\n\n==Cold War==\nThese achievements were honoured by the prefix \"Royal\", conferred by [[King George VI]] in 1947. Twenty of the pre-war squadrons were reformed postwar as fighter units. Events after the Second World War heralded a time of great danger for the UK. The onset of the [[Cold War]] with the [[Communist Bloc]] leading to the [[Berlin Air Lift]] and ultimately the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950. During these crises the RAuxAF fighter squadrons, the five newly formed Air Observation Post (AOP) squadrons and other RAuxAF units, played their part in the UK's air defence and participated in many [[NATO]] air exercises. In 1951, at the height of the Korean War, all 20 RAuxAF fighter squadrons (representing one third of Fighter Command strength) were called up for three months full-time service; they were required for home defence in place of regular squadrons earmarked for deployment to Korea. In the event RAF fighter squadrons were not needed in Korea, but the RAuxAF squadrons were retained for intensive refresher training at their home bases.\n\nThe 10 March 1957 saw the disbandment of all 20 RAuxAF fighter squadrons, the five post-war AOP squadrons and the Light Anti-Aircraft ground-based squadrons of the [[RAF Regiment|Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment]].  In the following two years or so, the Auxiliary Fighter Control Units associated with them were also disbanded.  On 16 March 1960, the [[Air Commodore-in-Chief]] and His Royal Highness [[Prince Philip]], [[Duke of Edinburgh]], invited the Squadron Commanders and Flight Commanders of all the disbanded Royal Auxiliary Air Force units to a Reception at [[Buckingham Palace]]. All were given the following letter from the Air Commodore-in-Chief:\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  =\n[[Buckingham Palace|BUCKINGHAM PALACE]]\n\nI have welcomed this opportunity of taking leave of the Commanding Officers and senior Auxiliary officers of the squadrons of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force which are being disbanded and of sending through them this message of appreciation and thanks to all their officers, airmen and airwomen.\n\nThe history of the Auxiliary Air Force has been a glorious one.  The first Auxiliary squadrons were included in the Air Defence of Great Britain in 1925.  By the outbreak of war in 1939 the Auxiliary fighter, coastal and balloon squadrons formed an integral and vital part of our forces.  It was aircraft of these squadrons which shot down the first enemy bomber over this country; and Auxiliary squadrons were heavily engaged in the air over Dunkirk and throughout the Battle of Britain.  Later they were to win battle honours over the Atlantic, in Malta, North Africa, Sicily and Italy, the Arakan and Burma, and in Normandy, France and Germany.\n\nAfter the war, the fighter squadrons were reconstituted as the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the traditional spirit of voluntary service found new outlets with the formation of Regiment, Air OP, Fighter Control and Radar reporting Units, some of which are to remain in being and provide further opportunities for voluntary service.\n\nThe association of the Force with my family has always been close.  I was proud to become Honorary Air Commodore of Nos 603, 2603 and 3603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadrons in 1951 and to succeed my father as Honorary Air Commodore-in-Chief of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force in 1952.  Members of my family have always treasured their association with Auxiliary squadrons as Honorary Air Commodores.\n\nI wish as Air Commodore-in-Chief to thank officers, airmen and airwomen of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force for all that they have given to the service of the country by their enthusiasm, their spirit and their devotion to duty in peace and war.  It is a sad day when it is necessary to tell so many that it is no longer possible to use their services on the duties they have assumed so willingly.  I wish them to know that they can look back with pride and satisfaction to service well done.\n\n16 March 1957\n\nElizabeth R\n|quoted = 1\n}}\n\nThe renaissance of the RAuxAF began in 1959 with the formation of three Maritime Headquarters Units and one Maritime Support Unit.  The MSU in Belfast was short-lived, but No 1 (County of Hertford) MHU in Northwood, No 2 (City of Edinburgh) MHU in Edinburgh and No 3 (County of Devon) MHU in Mountbatten continued in existence until No 3 was amalgamated into No 1 in 1999.  Later that year No 1 was renumbered 600 (City of London) Squadron and No 2 was renumbered 603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadron.  These three units formed the entirety of the RAuxAF for twenty years until expansion starting in 1979, with the formation of three Regiment Field Squadrons, continuing with a Movements Squadron in 1982, and, following lessons learned during the [[Falklands War|Falklands conflict]], an Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron in 1983. A later addition, in 1987, was an auxiliary element (The Grampian Troop) formed within a regular RAF Regiment [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier]] Air Defence Squadron. Another step forward was taken in 1986, with the raising of four Defence Force Flights with the role of ground defence of key points on air bases. In 1984, the RAuxAF's [[Diamond Jubilee]] was marked by the award to the Service of its own badge, which forms the basic motif of the Sovereign's Colour for the Royal Auxiliary Force presented by Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] in 1989. The words of the badge motto are ''COMITAMUR AD ASTRA'' \u2013 Latin \"We go with them to the stars\".\n\n==Gulf War and beyond==\nDuring the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, the Aeromedical and Movements Squadrons were mobilised and performed with great distinction in theatre and at other locations in the UK and overseas.\n\n[[File:2623 Troops shooting.jpg|left|2623sqn RAuxAF Regiment Shooting [[General purpose machine gun|GPMG]] on range|thumb]]\n\nOn 5 April 1997, all of the four war-appointable flights of the then [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] were fully amalgamated into the [[RAuxAF]], each with squadron status. In recognition of their origins, and in the absence of direct county or city territorial affiliations, they were each given the honour of retaining the letters \"VR\" within their squadron titles. The remaining non-active support elements of the RAFVR were and remain unaffected by this amalgamation, namely the [[RAFVR(T)]], the [[University Air Squadron|RAFVR(UAS)]], and at its point of formation, the [[Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme|RAFVR(DTUS)]] (being the branches for Training, University Air Squadron, and the Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme, respectively).\n\n[[File:Standard_presentation_2622sqn.jpg|thumb|upright|The 2622sqn RAuxAF Regiment standard is presented to an officer on 30 September 2006]]\n\nDuring 2003 the RAuxAF was involved in the first large-scale mobilisation for over 50 years. More than 900 personnel, over 70% of its trained strength, were called into full-time service and were deployed to support RAF operations in [[Cyprus]], [[Kuwait]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], as well as those in the UK.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe Royal Auxiliary Air Force establishment (liability) is set at 2,920 \u2013 though recruitment difficulties mean the RAuxAF is currently at a strength well below that; the RAuxAF's compromised 1,510 personnel as of April 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/314795/uk_reserve_force_cadets_2014.pdf |title=UK Reserve Forces and Cadets |date=29 May 2014 |work=Ministry of Defence |accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 July 2007, [[Senior Aircraftman]] Chris Dunsmore, aged 29, of [[No. 504 Squadron RAF|504 (County of Nottingham) Sqn RAuxAF]] was one of three men killed by a rocket attack on the RAF base at [[Basrah Airport]], Iraq.

and south coast underground and introduce into service more advanced radars.  However, manning difficulties in the immediate post-war regular RAF led to a number of Fighter Control and Radar Reporting units of the RAuxAF being formed, from 1948 onwards. In the early and uncertain days of the [[Cold War]], the Fighter Control and Radar Reporting units were largely responsible for manning the entire UK Control and Reporting system.  All were disbanded by 1961.

In the event, 12 were formed in the Light Anti-Aircraft role, equipped with 40mm anti-aircraft guns and attached to the RAuxAF flying squadrons.  By 1955, due to the introduction into service of more sophisticated weapons, the squadrons were converted to Regiment Field Squadrons.  All 12 squadrons were disbanded, along with the flying squadrons, in 1957.  However, three new field squadrons were re-formed in 1979, followed by two more in 1982 and a sixth in 1983.  Since then, two have been disbanded and two have been re-roled. In addition, No 1339 Wing was formed in 1085 and consisted of 2729 and 2890 (both City of Lincoln Squadrons,) equipped with Skyguard Raddar and Oerlikon guns both captured from the Argentians during the 1982 Falklands War Both squadrons were disbanded in 1994 to become the Rapier Cadreisation Unit and then No 27 and 48 Squadrons RAF Regiment.\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*2501 (County of Gloucester)\n*2502 (Ulster)\n*2503 (County of Lincoln)*\n*2504 (County of Nottingham)\n*2600 (City of London)\n*2602 (City of Glasgow)\n*2603 (City of Edinburgh\n*2605 (County of Warwick)\n*2608 (North Riding of Yorkshire)\n{{Col-break}}\n*2609 (West Riding of Yorkshire)\n*2611 (West Lancashire)\n*2612 (County of Aberdeen)\n*2620 (County of Norfolk)*\n*2622 (Highland)*\n*2623 (East Anglian)*\n*2625 (County of Cornwall)\n*2729 (City of Lincoln)\n*2890 (City of Lincoln)\n{{col-end}}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> denotes current active squadrons\n\nRegiment Squadrons took the number of their parent flying squadron, prefixed with 2.  Fighter Control Units were nominally attached likewise and their numbers were prefixed with 3, although they were not necessarily formally attached to any particular flying squadron, not being based at any airfield.\n\n===Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force 1949\u20131993===\n{{Main|Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force}}\n\n=== Airfield Defence Force Flights 1986\u20131993 ===\n\n*RAF Brampton\n*RAF High Wycombe\n*RAF St Athan\nand\n*[[RAF Lyneham]] \u2013 members of the Defence Force served the Royal Air Force at Lyneham for eight years between 1986 and 1994.\n\nA localised recruiting drive began in the summer of 1986. At the time, the Cold War was still in progress and the Soviet Union was regarded as a considerable threat to UK bases. So a plan was created to develop a system of ground defence for the vital bases without extending regular forces and for a modest outlay. As the Royal Auxiliary Air Force had already been revived in 1979 to provide aeromedical evacuation services, air movements and Regiment Field squadrons, it was planned to set up the Defence Force flights and task one of them to protect RAF Lyneham, home of the UK's air transport squadrons.\n\nVolunteers between 18 and 50 were sought within a radius of 50 miles of Lyneham and the first training flight came into being in late 1986, under the command of Flt Lt Bryan Tovey, a retired RAF Squadron Leader. Within five years, over 100 volunteers attended Lyneham on Wednesday evenings and weekends, trained in all the essential field combat skills such as weapons handling and live-firing practice, fieldcraft, perimeter defence, fighting in built up areas, reconnaissance, intelligence-gathering, fire-fighting and rescue techniques plus nuclear, biological and chemical monitoring. Battlefield skills were regularly tested at military training areas and such was the reputation built-up by the Lyneham Defence Force that their personnel were once used to assist regular special forces in training scenarios. The Defence Force field sections and Combined Incident Teams were based with the [[RAF Regiment]] contingent at Lyneham and played a full part in the station's Tactical Evaluation tests, conducted by NATO examiners.  In the final TacEval before the Defence Force was stood down, Lyneham received outstanding marks and its Station Commander particularly thanked the Auxiliaries for their contribution. Such performance did not go unnoticed in the wider air force and in 1993, the Lyneham DF was awarded the Robins Trophy as the outstanding RAuxAF unit of the year.  The trophy was presented by the RAuxAF Inspector General at a ceremony at Lyneham in 1994.\n\n=== The Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) ===\n\nThe foundations of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force were laid by the [[Women's Royal Air Force (World War I)|Women's Royal Air Force]] (WRAF) which was formed early in 1918, but, although plans were formulated for the continual employment of women with the RAF in peacetime, they had to be abandoned on account of the drastic post-war economy and by April 1920, the disbandment of the WRAF was complete.\n\nWhen the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) came into being in September 1938, it contained separate RAF companies, but following the [[Munich Crisis|Munich crisis]] of 1938, it became apparent that these companies should be brought more closely under RAF control.  Accordingly, the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF) was constituted by Royal Warrant on 28 June 1939.\n\nInitially, recruiting was limited to officers and NCOs only, recruiting for the original RAF companies being undertaken by the AAF.  However, with the coming of the Second World War, airwomen were to join the ranks and, by mid 1943, there were 182,000 women serving in the WAAF, in all the RAF trade groups.  In common with the AAF, the women's force became less 'auxiliary' as the war went on; but on the outbreak of war, the WAAF consisted of 234 officers and 1500 airwomen, all of whom could be considered pre-war volunteers in the true auxiliary mould.\n\nInitially, entry was confined to the few service trades then open to women, namely MT Driver, Equipment Assistant, Cook, Clerk and Mess and Kitchen Staff.  A small number of fabric workers were also employed.  By August 1939, additional trades were authorised: Teleprinter Operators, Telephone Operators and Plotters. Without the services of the WAAF, the RAF would have required an additional 150,000 airmen who could not have been obtained as easily as the women and who could only be provided at the expense of other Services or production.  The success of the women's Service is all the more remarkable in view of the prejudice against employing women that undoubtedly existed at the beginning of the war.\n\n===Barrage Balloon Organisation of the Auxiliary Air Force===\n{{main|Barrage Balloon Organisations of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]]\n* [[Reserve Forces and Cadets Association]]\n* [[RAF Balloon Command]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Halley, James J.

The current [[Ram Pickup (fifth generation)|'''fifth-generation Ram''']] debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show#2018|2018 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], Michigan in January of that year.\n\nPreviously, Ram was part of the [[Dodge]] line of light trucks. The name ''Ram'' was first used in 1981 Dodge Trucks following the retiring and rebadging of the [[Dodge D Series]] pickup trucks as well as B-series vans, though the company had used a ram's-head hood ornament on some trucks as early as 1933.<ref name=\"ED-DRG\" />\n\nRam trucks have been named ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year| Truck of the Year]] seven times; the second-generation Ram won the award in 1994, the third-generation Ram ''Heavy Duty'' won the award in 2003, the fourth-generation Ram Heavy Duty won in 2010 and the fourth-generation Ram 1500 won in 2013 and 2014, and the current [[Ram Pickup (fifth generation)|fifth-generation]] Ram 1500 won in 2019 and 2020. \n \n{{TOC left}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==First generation (1981; D/W)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = 89DodgeRam F34.jpg\n| caption = 1989 Ram D100\n| production = 1981\u20131993\n| platform = [[Chrysler AD platform]]\n| body_style = 2-door pickup truck<br />2-door extended cab pickup truck<br />4-door crew cab pickup truck\n| wheelbase = Regular cab/6.5' bed:<br />{{convert|115|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Regular cab/8' bed:<br />{{convert|131|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Club Cab/6.5' bed:<br />{{convert|133|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Club Cab/8' bed:<br />{{convert|149|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Crew cab/8' bed:<br />{{convert|165|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n| length = {{convert|190.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br /> {{convert|210.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|76|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />{{convert|73|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine = {{convert|225|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine#225|slant-6]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br />{{convert|239|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine#239 V6|LA V6]]<br />{{convert|318|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|LA V8]]<br />{{convert|360|cuin|L|abbr=on}} LA V8<br />{{convert|5.9|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Cummins B Series engine#B5.9|Cummins]] [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n| transmission = 3- or 4-speed ''[[Torqueflite]]'' automatic<br />4- or 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n| related = [[Dodge Ramcharger]]\n}}\n\nThe first-generation Ram trucks and vans introduced in 1981 featured a Ram hood ornament first used on Dodge vehicles from 1932 to 1954.<ref name=\"ED-DRG\">{{cite web |title=Dodge Ram - Generations |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46028 |publisher=Edmunds.com |first=John |last=DiPietro |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080801102809/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D46028 |archivedate=2008-08-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Not all of the first-generation trucks have this ornament and is most commonly seen on [[four-wheel-drive]] models. Dodge kept the previous generation's model designations: \"D\" or ''Ram'' indicated [[two-wheel drive]] while \"W\" or ''Power Ram'' indicated [[four-wheel drive]]. Just like [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], Dodge used 150 to indicate a half-ton truck, 250 for a three-quarter-ton truck, and 350 for a one-ton truck. The truck models were offered in standard cab, \"Club\" extended cab, and crew cab configurations. They also were offered along with {{convert|6.5|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} bed lengths and \"Utiline\" and \"Sweptline\" styled boxes along with standard boxes. Externally, the first-generation Rams were facelifted versions of the previous generation Dodge D-Series pickups introduced in 1972. The new model introduced larger wraparound [[Automotive lighting|tail lamps]], dual rectangular [[headlamp]]s, and squared-off body lines. Engine choices were pared down to the [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|225 Slant-6]] and [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|318]] and [[Chrysler LA engine#360 V8|360 V8s]]. The interior was updated and included a new bench seat and a completely new dashboard and instrument cluster with an optional three-pod design - a speedometer in the center, with the two side pods containing an ammeter on the top left, a temperature gauge bottom left, a fuel gauge on the top right and an oil pressure gauge bottom right. Models without the full gauge package had only indicator lights in the place of the temperature and oil pressure gauges. Among the options offered on the Ram were front bumper guards, a sliding rear cab window, air-conditioning, cruise control, tilt steering column, power door locks and windows, AM/FM stereo with cassette tape player, styled road wheels, aluminum turbine-style mag wheels, special paint and stripe packages, two-tone paint, and a plow package for four-wheel-drive models (referred to as the Sno Commander).\n\nThe \"Club Cab\" was dropped from the lineup after 1982, but Dodge kept the tooling and re-introduced nearly a decade later in the 1991 models. The four-door crew cab and Utiline beds were dropped after the 1985 model year, to make room on the assembly line for the upcoming 1987 [[Dodge Dakota]], and were never reintroduced in this generation.\n\nBasic Ram 100 models were reintroduced for 1984, replacing the previous \"Miser\" trim level available on the Ram 150. A \"Ram-Trac\" shift-on-the-fly transfer case was added for the 1985 Power Rams, and both the crew cab and Utiline flared bed were dropped for 1986. In 1988 the Slant-6 engine was replaced by a {{convert|3.9|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler LA engine#239 V6|V6]] engine. The {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine also received [[electronic fuel injection]] in 1988. Because of a new computer controlled fuel injection, ignition and ABS system, more vehicle information needed to be displayed through any warning or notification lights; so inside the cab where a small compartment was once located on the dash, a new \"message center\" with four small rectangular light spots, contained the [[check engine light]] and other [[Tell-tale (automotive)|tell-tales]] including one for the parking brake and the [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] if the truck was so equipped. The message center later included \"Wait to Start\" and \"Water in Fuel\" lights on diesel models. Diagnostic fault codes were stored in the computer's memory, and cycling the ignition key three times would allow the computer to flash the trouble codes through the check-engine light for diagnosis of some problems.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/fix/80s-codes.html |title=Retrieving fault codes |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=2010-11-22}}</ref> Rear [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] became standard equipment in 1989.\n\nThe Ram 100 model designation was dropped and these models folded back into the 150 range for 1990, due to the introduction and sales success of the [[Dodge Dakota]] pickup. Additionally, the instrument cluster was slightly revised; the [[ammeter]] was replaced by a [[voltmeter]] while maintaining the 3-pod arrangement of the speedometer and gauges. Also in 1990, Dodge reintroduced the Club Cab, equipped with fold-out jump seats for the 1991-1993 models. Entry was made through the passenger or driver's doors, as there were no rear doors for this configuration.\n\nThese trucks, though popular with fleets, sold poorly compared to the [[Ford F-Series]] and the [[Chevrolet C/K|General Motors C/K Trucks]], with just under 100,000 units sold most years of their production. Part of this was due to the dated cab and chassis design which had been in production since 1972, there was no powerful diesel option until 1989, and there was no big-block gas V8 option. Additionally, the interior had been given few updates since 1981.\n\n===Engines & transmissions===\nFor 1989, the 5.9&nbsp;L V8 received throttle-body [[fuel injection]] for a 20&nbsp;hp (15&nbsp;kW) gain. Additionally, Dodge introduced a new [[Torqueflite|overdrive automatic transmission]] for reduced fuel consumption. This light-duty transmission was designated the A500, and was offered with the 3.9&nbsp;L V6 and 5.2&nbsp;L V8. An \"O/D Off\" pushbutton switch to lock out the overdrive 4th gear was added to the message center. The [[TorqueFlite#A727 .2836RH.2F37RH.29|A727 automatic]] saw continued use for some 5.2&nbsp;L engines, all 5.9&nbsp;L engines, and heavy-duty applications.\n\nThe grille was redesigned for 1991 but kept the large rectangular [[headlamp]]s and crossbar appearance. The engines were substantially [[Chrysler LA engine|upgraded]] for 1992 (3.9&nbsp;L and 5.2&nbsp;L) 1993 and 1994 (5.9&nbsp;L) with multi-port fuel injection, new manifolds, and higher-compression cylinder heads for noticeably higher output. These newly-revised engines were marketed under the \"Magnum\" name. A heavy-duty automatic transmission with overdrive called the [[TorqueFlite#A518 .2846RH.2F46RE.29|A518]] was offered with the 5.2&nbsp;L and 5.9&nbsp;L engines. As part of Chrysler's overhaul of corporate transmission nomenclature, the A500 and A518 were redesignated 42RH and 46RH, respectively, in 1992. The initial \"4\" signified a 4-speed transmission, the second digit identified the transmission's relative torque capacity, the letter \"R\" in the third position denoted a rear-wheel-drive transmission, and the final letter \"H\" signified hydraulic shift control. The 3-speed automatic remained available; the A727 was redesignated 36RH, and the A904, A998, and A999 became the 30RH, 31RH, and 32RH, respectively.\n\n====5.9 Cummins====\n[[File:1993 Dodge Ram W250 Club Cab 4x4 Cummins td.jpg|thumb|1993 W250 Club Cab]]\nA [[Cummins B Series engine]] was also added to the engine lineup in 1989.<ref name=\"AllparCummins\">{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/cummins-diesel.html |title=Cummins 5.9-liter and 6.7-liter inline six-cylinder diesel engines |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-24}}</ref> For the first time, Dodge saw sales increase. The Cummins was coupled with a heavier-duty version of the [[TorqueFlite#A727|A727 automatic]] or a 5-speed [[manual transmission]] and is available on 250 and 350 pickups and pickup-based chassis-cab trucks. This diesel engine option was different from the optional diesels in Ford and GM trucks. The Cummins features direct injection, whereas the Ford and GM diesels feature [[indirect injection]]; this also means that the Cummins does not have to rely on [[glowplug]]s. The Cummins is a [[straight-six engine]], whereas the GM and Ford diesel engines are V8 engines. Additionally, the Cummins is [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]], while the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine|6.2&nbsp;L GM/DDC]] and [[International Harvester IDI|7.3 IDI Ford/IH]] are [[naturally aspirated]].<ref name=\"AllparCummins\"/>\n\nPre-1994 Cummins-engined Dodge pickups are often termed a \"First-Gen Cummins\".\n\nThis was not the first engine to appear in Dodge pickup trucks as a diesel option.

The original concept, dubbed the \"Louisville Slugger\" by Chrysler's Advanced Packaging Studio, was to be a modular platform that would accommodate a full-size truck and full-size van, which would have provided a roomy cab and cargo bed.<ref name=\"Jalopnik\">{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/the-original-design-for-the-second-gen-dodge-ram-was-a-1825251176 |title=The Original Design For The Second-Gen Dodge Ram Was A Styling Disaster |author=Westbrook, Justin T. |work=Jalopnik |date=August 13, 2018 |accessdate=November 5, 2018}}</ref> The modular design was scrapped in 1987 and was replaced with a more conventional truck design when the design was moved to the [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] design studio.<ref name=\"Jalopnik\"/> The more conventional design, dubbed \"Phoenix\", was originally scheduled for a 1991 production; when Bob Lutz showed it to the new styling designers, chief designer Phillip E. Payne told him, \"It looks like nothing more than a rehash of everybody else's truck.\" At that, Lutz told him he had six months to come up with something better.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autosofinterest.com/2012/07/21/design-notes-1994-dodge-ram-truck/ |title=Design Notes: 1994 Dodge Ram Truck |publisher=Autos of Interest |date=2012-07-21 |accessdate=2015-06-29}}</ref> The exterior styling of the truck that was eventually released was the result of design concepts by Payne during 1988-1990. A review by the Dodge pick-up truck studio designers felt that modern pick-ups looked \"too flat and sedan-like\", while the [[Studebaker E-series truck|early 1950s Studebaker pick-up]] and the [[semi-trailer truck]]s had just the right \"macho\" look to them.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=29&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=%22dodge+ram%22&OS=%22dodge+ram%22&RS=%22dodge+ram%22 |title=U.S. Patent D396,828 - Body Styling of 1994 Dodge Ram |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |date=August 11, 1998 |accessdate=2010-11-22}}</ref> The design featured a [[big rig|big-rig]]-looking front end and a large grille that was deemed risky at its introduction, but ultimately proved popular with consumers.<ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\">{{cite web |url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/ram-1500/1994/1994-dodge-ram-1500-laramie-slt/ |title=1994 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie SLT - Long-Term Wrap-Up |author=Killeen, Scott |work=Motor Trend |date=February 1, 1996 |accessdate=February 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nMaking its debut on January 5, 1993 at the [[North American International Auto Show]] and going on sale on October 1, 1993, the redesigned 1994 Ram was a sales success and was named \"[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]]\" by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' in 1994.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/06/business/company-news-new-pickup-is-displayed-by-chrysler.html</ref><ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\"/> Sales increased from 95,542 units in 1993 to 232,092 in 1994, 410,000 in 1995, and 411,000 by 1996. That year, it was prominently featured as the hero vehicle in the film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1996/06/01/reels-and-reels-of-wheels/cf2cbd8b-c945-47ac-9c31-3e970910fca7/?noredirect=on |title=Reels and Reels of Wheels |first=Warren |last=Brown |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 1, 1996 |accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.motorious.com/articles/news/315749/twister-replica-dodge-ram-sure-to-kick-up-a-storm-at-auction |title=Twister Replica Dodge Ram Sure To Kick Up A Storm At Auction |first=Tyler |last=Heatley |website=Motorious |date=March 28, 2019 |accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> Sales of this generation peaked at just over 400,000 in 1999 before declining against the redesigned [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks. By 2001, Ram sales figures were below those of Ford and Chevy trucks.\n\nEngine offerings continued over from the first-generation Ram and were the 3.9&nbsp;L V6, 5.2&nbsp;L V8, 5.9&nbsp;L V8, and 5.9&nbsp;L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] Cummins turbo diesel. Added to the line up was a new 488 cubic inch 8.0L V10 engine designed as an alternative for those who wanted superior pulling power but did not want a diesel. The new [[V10 engine|V10]] and Cummins turbo diesel could only be had in the 2500 and higher designation models. Models were now the 1500 half-ton, 2500 three-quarter-ton, and 3500 dual-rear-wheel one-ton in both 2- and 4-wheel drive. 1500 Rams offered both 6.5- and 8-foot (2 and 2.4 m, respectively) boxes. 2500 Rams offered {{convert|6.5|ft|m|adj=on}} boxes with club or quad Cabs.\n\nDodge offered the 2500 series in two different gross-vehicle-weight ratings for the first few years, but this was later dropped. The purpose of the difference between the light-duty and heavy-duty 2500 trucks was for the heavy-duty 2500 to take the place of the discontinued one-ton single-rear-wheel trucks. Rear axles for the light-duty 2500 trucks were [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|semi-floating]], while the heavy-duty 2500 rear axles were [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|full-floating]].\n\nOn the inside, special attention was paid to in-cab storage features, with a large glovebox, a center armrest storage area, and extra storage space behind the seat. The dash and gauge cluster were a far cry from the previous model Ram and were far more modern as well. A redesign of the dashboard and instrument cluster was introduced in 1998 along with the introduction of the quad cab, and rounded black plastic side-view mirrors replaced the previous rectangular design.\n\n===1998 updates===\nIn 1998, Dodge introduced the \"Quad Cab\", which uses smaller, [[suicide doors]] directly behind the main doors. This was offered as an option on the \"Club Cab\" for this model year. Other changes for 1998 included rounded mirrors replacing the classic square ones, a revised interior, dual airbags, a chime replacing the buzzer for seat belts/door ajar/headlights/ and a digital [[odometer]]. The [[OBD II]] System was also standard, with a computer port near the driver's-side footwell and a code-checking system via the new digital [[odometer]] readout.\n\nIn late 1998 Dodge introduced a revised front end for the 1999 model year Sport models with a restyled bumper, quad-beam clear-lens [[headlamp]]s, and body-color grille. A 6-speed manual transmission was made optional for diesel variants in late 2000 for the 2001 model year. A small percentage of the diesel engines for 1999 and 2000 model years were subject to problems within the water jackets and fuel injectors. The most problematic was the \"53\" stamped engine block which had a defect that would cause fracturing in the structure of the block itself. The 2000 models became optional with heated leather seats. The braking system was upgraded to dual-piston calipers in the front. An Offroad Edition was offered as a package with a 2-inch lift accomplished with stiffer front springs and rear lift blocks, unique 17x8 wheels, 275/70/17 all terrain tires, 4.10 gears, trussed Dana 44 in the front, limited slip differential, and skid plates.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/ram1.html |title=200 Dodge Ram specifications |publisher=pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=January 27, 2014}}</ref> The Offroad Edition models are also distinguishable with an additional decal on the tailgate under the 4x4 decal that says \"Offroad.\"\n\nAlthough Dodge introduced a new Ram 1500 for 2002, the old second-generation style Ram was carried over for the 2002 model year heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 trucks. The new third-generation Ram would not appear in the 2500/3500 variants until 2003. Part of this delay was due to the then new 5.7&nbsp;L Hemi engine not being ready for production.\n\n====Mexico====\n{{main|Dodge Ramcharger}}\nUnencumbered by CAFE ([[Corporate average fuel economy]]) restrictions, DaimlerChrysler's Mexican subsidiary developed a three-door wagon version of the Ram, called the [[Dodge Ramcharger|Ram Charger]] as was its predecessor. It first appeared in 1998 but was never available in the United States.<ref name=SS03>{{cite book | ref = SS03 | title = Katalog Samochody \u015awiata 2003 | trans-title = World Car Catalogue 2003 | editor-first = Eligiusz | editor-last = Mazur | publisher = Print Shops Prego - Polska Sp. z o.o. | location = Warsaw, Poland | page = 217 | date = 2002 | issn = 1234-8198 }}</ref>\n\n===Drivetrain===\n\n====Transmissions====\nTransmissions for the Ram\n*[[TorqueFlite|A500/42RH-RE]] lower geared light duty applications found behind the 3.9 L V6\n*[[TorqueFlite|A518/46RH-RE]] for more heavy duty applications found behind the 5.2 L and 5.9 L V8 engines.\n*[[TorqueFlite|A618/47RH-RE]] for heavy duty use behind the V10 gasoline and Cummins diesel engines. The 47RH was used in 1994 and 1995 model years, while the 47RE was used from 1996 through 2002.\n[[New Venture Gear 3500 transmission|NV3500]] was offered in 1500 Rams and light-duty 2500 Rams.\n[[New Venture Gear 4500 transmission|NV4500]] was standard in 2500 and 3500 trucks; the NV4500HD for V10 and diesel models (''except the uncommon, light-duty 2500 rams'').\nA [[New Venture Gear 5600 transmission|NV5600]] was offered in 1999 and 2000 Rams and was the only transmission offered behind the High Output diesel in 2001 and 2002.\n\n====Transfer cases====\nThere were a total of five [[transfer case]]s available for the four-wheel-drive Ram. All are part-time and have a low range of 2.72:1. The 1500 featured a NP231 and NP231HD. The NP241 was standard on V8 2500 Rams. The 2500 and 3500 V10 and diesel featured a NP241DLD from 1993 to 1997. In 1997 the NP241DHD became an option for 2500 Rams and was standard on 3500 Rams from 1998 to 2002.\n\n====Axles====\nThe Dodge Ram features a wide variety of axles. For the front axle of 4x4 Rams, a [[Dana 44]] was used on all 1500 Rams and the early (light-duty) 2500 Rams. However, most of the 2500 and all 3500 Rams use [[Dana 60]] front axles. The 1500 Rams and some early light duty 2500 Rams used a 9.25 Chrysler (Spicer) axle in the rear. A [[Dana 60]] rear axle was used on heavy duty 2500 V8 Rams. A [[Dana 70]] rear axle was used in 2500 Rams with a V10 or a Diesel/Automatic transmission combination. A [[Dana 80]] rear axle was used on 2500 Rams with a manual transmission and V10/diesel engine combination. Every 3500 Ram was made with a Dana 80. The front drive axles in these Rams were unique in the fact they did not have [[locking hubs]], but featured a [[center axle disconnect]]. The 2002 2500 and 3500 Rams saw the eventual phase out of the Center axle disconnect, in favor of front axles that were permanently locked in. Dodge continued to include front axles like this for their 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 trucks until 2013 models.\n\n===Engines===\nA [[natural gas|natural-gas-powered]] engine debuted for 1995 but was not popular and was only used in fleet vehicles on a very limited production run. The [[Cummins B Series engine]] was switched from the 12-valve to the 24-valve (ISB) version in the middle of the 1998 model-year Dodge Rams due to emissions regulations. The ISB featured a new computer-controlled electronic injection pump and 24-valve head design.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n!8th VIN\n|-\n|{{nowrap|1994\u20132001}}||{{convert|239|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 3.9L|Magnum]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||{{convert|175|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|225|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}|| X\n|-\n|1994\u20132001||{{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.2|Magnum]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]||{{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>|| Y\n|-\n|1995\u20131997||{{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} Natural Gas V8 ||{{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|430|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||\n|-\n|1994\u20131997||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|325|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||Z (5 for the heavy-duty version)\n|-\n|1998\u20132002||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|245|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|335|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||Z (5 for the heavy-duty version)\n|-\n|1994\u20132002||{{convert|488|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref>[http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/attachments/08192002_VIPER_OVERVIEW.pdf Chapter 3 for 2003: Dodge Viper SRT-10] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320113521/http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/attachments/08192002_VIPER_OVERVIEW.pdf |date=March 20, 2009 }}.

It included longitudinal stripes similar to those on the Dodge Viper along with an optional door sticker stating \"Official Truck of the 80th Indianapolis 500\". These trucks had a {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine with upgraded exhaust and {{convert|15|hp|abbr=on}} more power. These also included {{convert|17|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheels with Goodyear Eagle II 275/60R-17 tires. The SS/T (Super Sport Truck) version was available from 1997 to 1998 and included all the same upgrades except the door sticker. The SS/T also had \"SS/T\" designed into the stripe on both the hood and tailgate. The Indy Trucks were available only in blue with white stripes.

This was a major update including an all new frame, suspension, powertrains, interiors, and sheet metal. The crew cab models for this generation were actually Quad Cab trucks that had conventional-opening rear doors. The four-wheel-drive light trucks (1500 series) lost their [[live axle]]s in favor of an [[independent suspension|independent front suspension]], but the 2500 and 3500 series retained the live axles for maximum longevity and durability; rear-wheel-drive 2500 & 3500 had class-exclusive rack and pinion steering for their independent front suspension (the 1500 also received rack and pinion steering for the first time). This body style drew heavily from the previous generation.\n\nThe redesigned trucks bolstered sales, with 400,000 sold during 2001-2002 and nearly 450,000 sold during 2002-2003, a new high point for the Ram name. At the same time, both [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks were increasing in sales from a 2001 peak over 850,000 to the 900,000 range. But with 400,543 Rams sold that year, the Ram's sales could not keep up with the eleventh-generation [[Ford F-Series eleventh generation|F-150]] in 2004.\n\n===2006 Facelift===\n\n[[File:2006-2008 Dodge Ram 1500 -- 03-16-2012.JPG|thumb|left|2006\u20132008 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab]]\n\nThe Dodge Ram was updated for the 2006 model year. One notable addition was the \"Mega Cab\", featuring a {{convert|6.25|ft|m|0|adj=on}} cargo box and {{convert|22|in|0|abbr=}} of extra cab space, allowing seating for six with rear recliners, a full screen mapping in-dash navigation system became an option, and the [[headlamp]]s were redesigned to a more modern design.\n\nFor 2006, the [[steering wheel]] design was changed to one from the [[Dodge Dakota]] and [[Dodge Durango]]. [[Bluetooth]] [[U Connect]] was now available as an option, and a front facelift was given to all Ram models. [[SIRIUS Satellite Radio]] was available, as well was a rear seat [[DVD]] entertainment system with wireless [[headphones]]. The [[Street and Racing Technology|SRT]] model, with the 8.3&nbsp;L [[V10 engine]] from the [[Dodge Viper]] SRT/10, was discontinued after the 2006 [[model year]].\n\nFor 2007, Dodge changed the tail lights.\n\n===Chassis Cab===\nIn 2007, a 3500 Chassis Cab model was introduced with industry-standard rear frame width and wiring to accommodate outfitters. In addition to the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}, a [[Cummins]] {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[diesel engine|diesel]] rated at {{convert|350|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|650|lbft|0|abbr=on}} was also available. Automatic transmissions used were the [[Chrysler RFE transmission|545RFE]] with the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} and the [[List of Aisin transmissions|AS68RC]] with the {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The G56 transmission was the only manual transmission offered.\n\nFor 2008, Dodge introduced two more Chassis Cab models, the 4500 and 5500. These were [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class-4]] and [[Truck classification#Class 5|Class-5]] trucks with a gross weight of {{convert|16500|lb|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19500|lb|0|abbr=on}}, respectively. Both trucks came equipped with the same version of the [[Cummins]] {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[diesel engine|diesel]] as the 3500 chassis-cab model. [[Sterling Trucks|Sterling]], who worked with Dodge in development, had their own version, called the [[Sterling Bullet]] with a unique grille. Sterling is a division of [[Freightliner LLC]] which, like Dodge, was owned by the former [[DaimlerChrysler]]. [[Sterling Trucks]] was licensed to sell Dodge Ram 4500 series trucks as the Sterling Bullet. When the [[Sterling Trucks|Sterling]] brand was phased out by [[Chrysler Corporation]], the Bullet was discontinued.\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Model\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n|-\n|rowspan=5|1500||2002-2008||{{convert|226|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler PowerTech engine#3.7 EKG|Magnum]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||{{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|235|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|2002-2007||{{convert|287|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Magnum'' V8 ||{{convert|235|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|2008-2013||{{convert|287|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Magnum'' V8 ||{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=semihemi>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/47.html| title = The 4.7 Liter \"Next Generation\" and \"semi-Hemi\" V8 Engine (Dodge ) | work = Allpar.com: Trucks | publisher = Allpar LLC | first = Rick | last = Ehrenberg | accessdate = 2014-03-15 }}</ref>||{{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=semihemi/>\n|-\n|2002-2003||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|245|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|335|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|2003-2008||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine#New Hemi|Hemi]]'' V8 ||{{convert|345|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|375|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |2500/3500\n|2009||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8 ||{{convert|390|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002-2003 SO \"6\" Vin Designation||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Cummins B Series engine#ISB|Cummins]]'' [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]||{{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002\u20132003 SO California Emissions||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|235|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}||{{convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002-2004 HO \"C\" Vin Designation||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6||{{convert|305|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}||{{convert|555|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2004.5-2007 HO||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|325|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}||{{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2007-2009||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|650|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002-2003||{{convert|488|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Magnum V10|Magnum]]'' [[V10 engine|V10]]||{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|450|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Chassis Cab\n|2008\u20132009||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine#New Hemi|Hemi]]'' V8 (3500 Only)||{{convert|345|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|375|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2009||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8 (3500 Only)||{{convert|388|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|404|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2008\u20132009||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|SRT-10||2004-2006||{{convert|505|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Viper engine#Second generation|Viper]]'' [[V10 engine|V10]]||{{convert|510|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|535|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\nModels built after January 1, 2007 offered a new 6.7 L Cummins turbo diesel introduced as an option in 2500/3500 models replacing the 5.9 L.

This new Hemi still delivered {{convert|345|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|375|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Axles===\nFor the 2003 model year, AAM axles replaced the Dana Corp axles. In the front all 2500 and 3500 trucks were 9.25-inch with 33 spline axles. The rear options for the 2500 and 3500 were the AAM (often referred to as \"corporate\") [[10.5\" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#10.5 AAM|10.5]]\" and [[10.5\" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#11.5 AAM|11.5]]\". Rear axle shafts are 30 spline. The rear 11.5\" has a gear ratio \"carrier split\" at 3.73 and numerically higher, but the General Motors AAM axles used a different carrier spacing preventing installation of a Chrysler carrier into some GM axles, but the GM carrier can be installed in the Chrysler axle if a ring gear spacer is installed. Strength is similar to their earlier Dana 70 and 80 counterparts. Direct comparisons are difficult as the axles are made with completely different [[metallurgy]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:3rd Gen.jpg|2003 Dodge Ram diesel dually quad cab 2wd with the 5.9L Cummins Turbodiesel I6\nFile:2002-05 Dodge Ram.jpg|2005 Dodge Ram 1500 quad cab with the 5.7L Hemi V8\nFile:Dodge-Ram-Mega-Cab.jpg|Dodge Ram 2500 Mega Cab\nFile:Sterling Bullet.jpg|Sterling Bullet, a version of the Ram sold by [[Sterling Trucks]] with the 6.7L Cummins Diesel I6\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Special editions===\n* '''HemiSport''' - The HemiSport Edition was the Quad Cab version of the Rumble Bee, and was introduced in 2004.

It includes lower body cladding, 20\" wheels, a hood scoop, and an SLT interior specially trimmed with yellow dashboard and door panel inserts and a serialized number plate. On the rear of the box is a stripe with a \"Rumble Bee\" emblem, similar to that of the [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]].

Introduced in 2004 and only made in 2004 and 2005, these were customized by LA West of Indiana as ordered from dealers, adding an additional $8,300.50 in sticker price. It was available on regular-cab/short-box and quad-cab/short-box pickups and include a custom overall paint from Mopar's Impact colors from the 1970s (this includes Hemi Orange, Plum Crazy Purple, Sublime Green, and Banana Yellow). 20\" American Racing Motto chrome wheels, a new cowl \"blacked-out\" hood, and a specially trimmed leather 2-tone interior including a serialized number plate on the driver's-side doorjamb were offered. On the sides is a \"hockey-stick\" stripe with \"HEMI GTX\" that extended from the hood to the rear of the box. The air box was also painted to match the body color, and a color-matched steering wheel was added as well. They were only 433 produced in 2004 and roughly the same number in 2005.

It was available as a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 in Regular or Quad-Cab styles and featured lower-body cladding, 20-inch chrome wheels, SRT-10 hood, Borla dual exhaust, serialized number plate, and a tall rear spoiler reminiscent of the 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]]. The Daytonas had a black body stripe to match the rear spoiler and came in silver or \"Go Mango\" paint (a metallic orange color reminiscent of the Dodge's \"high impact\" colors from the 1960s and 1970s) with matching interior trim. The Dodge Ram Daytona had a 3.92 ratio rear end, the same rear end as the Dodge Ram Rumble Bee. Several exterior items were unique to the Daytona package (such as the gas door and dual side exit exhaust tips) which made it different from other equipment packages. It was equipped with {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} [[chrome plating|chrome]] wheels and performance tires. Replacing the standard hood is one with a non-functional [[hood scoop]]. The most noticeable feature is the large [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] which is attached at the rear of the cargo box.

This is because the competitors stopped making manual transmissions available in the domestic market. [[Chevrolet Silverado]] trucks discontinued the option of a manual transmission after model year 2006. [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks discontinued the option of a manual transmission after model year 2010. This applies to [[Truck classification#Class 2|Class 2]], [[Truck classification#Class 3|Class 3]], [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class 4]] and [[Truck classification#Class 5|Class 5]] trucks. 2011 and 2012 models make {{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

The 3500 Heavy Duty model was unveiled at the 2009 [[Chicago Auto Show]].\n\nEngine choices include 5.7&nbsp;L Hemi V8 rated at {{convert|383|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|542|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm for Ram 3500, 6.7 l Cummins turbo diesel rated at {{convert|350|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 3,013 rpm and {{convert|880|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 1,500 rpm for Ram 3500 (optional), 4500, 5500. Late-model 2011 diesel trucks were up-rated to {{convert|800|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nTransmission choices included a standard 6-speed manual or optional 6-speed [[Aisin]] automatic. Both transmissions support the Power Takeoff option.\n\nThe 3500 model has regular or crew cab, single-rear-wheel or dual-rear-wheel. Four cab-axle lengths (60, 84, 108 and 120&nbsp;inches) for 4500/5500 or two cab-axle lengths (60 and 84&nbsp;inches) for 3500, and three trim levels (ST, SLT and Laramie).\n\nThe Ram 3500 has three axle ratios (3.42, 3.73 and 4.10) and 17-inch wheels. Ram 4500/5500 has three axle ratios (4.10, 4.44 and 4.88) and 19.5-inch wheels. The 4500/5500 Rams rear axle is a [[Dana S 110]]. The front axle on 4x4 models is manufactured by [[Magna International|Magna]], while 2-wheel-drive models just have a solid, non-drive axle.\n\n====Concept truck====\nThe Ram concept truck \"Long Hauler\" from 2012 is based mostly on existing Ram truck parts. The powertrain, frame and wheels are all components of the Ram 5500 Chassis Cab. It is a \"Mega Cab\" optional on the lighter Rams. The [[Gross combined weight rating|GCWR]] for this truck is 37,500&nbsp;lb and the weight of the truck is 9,300&nbsp;lb.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/concepts/ram/long-hauler.html|title=Long Hauler |accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2013 changes===\n[[File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 01 China 2014-04-24.jpg|thumb|2013 Ram 1500]]\n[[File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 02 China 2014-04-24.jpg|thumb|2013 Ram 1500]]\n\nThe 1500 gets a minor restyling. It features new front fascia, optional projector beam halogen headlamps with [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] turn signals/parking lamps, wheels and interior, where the \"DODGE\" name was removed from the dashboard and replaced with \"RAM\".\n\nAll models offered for 2012 continue to be available for 2013 with the addition of a new trim, the Laramie, Longhorn, Limited. (Tradesman, Express, SLT, Big Horn, Lone Star, Sport, R/T, Laramie, and Laramie Longhorn). The Rambox cargo management system continues to be available on most models for 2013. For 2013, the base ST model becomes the Tradesman model.\n\n2013 models have revised engine and transmission options. The 3.7&nbsp;L V6 is discontinued, and the 4.7&nbsp;L V8 equipped with the 6-speed 65RFE Automatic takes its place as the new base engine, still producing {{convert|310|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. New to the lineup is Chrysler's corporate 3.6&nbsp;L Pentastar V6, coupled to the new [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 8-speed Torqueflite8 Automatic. It achieves best in class fuel efficiency and makes {{convert|305|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|269|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}. The Pentastar/ZF 8-speed is optional. Due to a new electric power steering system, the 5.7&nbsp;L HEMI V8 no longer has a power steering pump, and gains 5 horsepower, now making {{convert|395|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. It is still available with the 65RFE 6-speed Automatic, with the new 8-speed Torqueflite8 Automatic optional.\n\n[[Air suspension]] is optional for 2013 models, offering four ride height settings. [[Electronic stability control]] becomes standard on 2500 and 3500 models. For 2013, the Ram is also the first North American pickup truck to offer [[Smart key|keyless ignition]].\n\nNew infotainment systems are available for the RAM 1500 for 2013:\n\nThe base U Connect 3.0 (RA1) radio includes an AM/FM radio, Radio Data System (RDS), a monochrome LCD display screen, a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack, and a single USB port for charging purposes only.\n\nThe \"up-level\" U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) radio adds a full-color, 5.0-inch color touch-screen display, voice control for phone, a microSD card slot, Bluetooth for phone and A2DP wireless stereo audio streaming capabilities, and vehicle customization options on-screen.\n\nThe \"top-of-the-line\" radios are the U Connect ACCESS 8.4A (RA3) and U Connect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4). These radios add a full-color, 8.4-inch color touch-screen display, full voice control, [[SiriusXM]] satellite radio, the U Connect ACCESS System, featuring roadside assistance and 9-1-1 emergency call buttons on the rear-view mirror, mobile app compatibility, remote USB ports for integration of compatible devices, enhanced in-vehicle customization options, automatic notification of airbag deployment, concierge services, remote control via an app installed on a compatible [[smartphone]], and the ability to add GPS navigation from [[Garmin]] for vehicles not equipped with the option from the factory (it is activated by a dealership for a fee, however, does not include SiriusXM Travel Link or 3D mapping). The U Connect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4) adds GPS navigation from Garmin, [[HD Radio]] SiriusXM Travel Link, 3D mapping, and enhanced mobile app compatibility. The system also includes a built-in [[3G]] internet router, allowing for wireless connection to the internet while the vehicle is parked with a monthly service subscription. The system can also be updated to add additional features that will be available in the future via a USB stick inserted into one of the remote USB ports. Remote steering wheel-mounted controls are also included with this system.\n\nOptions such as a CD Player (mounted in the center console of the vehicle), SiriusXM satellite radio  and a Rearview Backup Camera can be added to any radio.\n\n====3500====\nThe 2013 models move up to an 18-inch standard wheel, with 18-inch [[Forging|forged]] [[Alcoa]] wheels as an option. 3500 models offer a High Output package for the diesel. The rear [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] ring gear is increased from 11.5 inches, to 11.8 inches on H.O. trucks. The 11.8 axle cover doubles as a [[heat sink]].\n\n====4x4====\nRam, once again, put the [[Center axle disconnect]] in 3500 4x4 models. 2500 Ram trucks did not have a CAD system until 2014 models. Ram claims this technology to improve fuel efficiency by 1 MPG, although [[EPA]] tests do not include class 2 and class 3 trucks in the [[Miles per gallon|MPG]]/fuel efficiency tests. The 4x4 saw additional changes with the [[transfer case]] now being made by [[BorgWarner]] instead of [[New Venture Gear]].\n\n====High Fuel Efficiency====\nA new model offered for the 2013 Ram is the HFE (High Fuel Efficiency). Based on the SLT model, the HFE offers 18/25 [[Miles per gallon|MPG]] out of its [[Pentastar]] V6 engine and eight-speed [[ZF 8HP transmission|Torque-Flite]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], which has nothing in common with the original Chrysler built [[TorqueFlite]]. It is available only in the six-foot bed, two-door, regular cab model with two-wheel-drive only. Standard features include a 220 amp [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|alternator]] and an 800 amp battery to assist with the [[Start-stop system]]. 3.21:1 axle gearing is also standard.\n\n===2014 changes===\n[[File:2014RAM3500.jpg|thumb|2014 Ram 3500 crew cab, 4\u00d74, DRW]]\nThe option of [[air suspension]] became available on the rear of 2014 model year 2500 and 3500 pick up trucks. 1500 models added the option of an [[List of VM Motori engines#A 630 DOHC|Eco-Diesel V6]]. 2500 models now feature coil spring suspension, instead of leaf spring. The cast iron, flex fuel, 4.7 V8 [[Chrysler PowerTech engine]] was discontinued, ending Corsair engine production, leaving the Ram 1500 with two engine choices. The aluminum, flex fuel 3.6 V6 [[Pentastar]] is now the base engine, along with the 8-speed [[ZF 8HP transmission|Torque-Flite]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]].

This was previously a $495.00 option on the Ram '''SLT'''.\n\n===2017 changes===\nFor 2017, the Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn and Limited trims received the new RAM front grille and \"RAM\" emblem across the rear tailgate that debuted on the 2016 RAM 1500 Rebel.\n\nIn mid-2017, the RAM 1500's 3.0&nbsp;L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbodiesel engine, produced by [[VM Motori]], was dropped in mid-2017 in response to emissions cheating allegations. The engine will be re-introduced in early 2018, as re-certification by the [[EPA]] has been obtained.\n\nThe 1500 SLT model loses the U Connect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) option, leaving the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) radio as the only radio option. However. all Ram heavy-duty (2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500) SLT models will still offer the U Connect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) as an option.\n\nThe Rebel trim level of the Ram 1500 gains the previously-optional U Connect ACCESS 8.4A infotainment system as standard equipment, as do the Big Horn and Lone Star trim levels. A Rebel Black Edition Package is available that adds black accents to the Rebel.\n\nThe Laramie trim level of the Ram 1500, 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 gets a standard nine-speaker, 506-watt [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] 7.1-channel surround-sound premium audio system as standard equipment.\n\nThree new special edition trim levels debut for 2017 for the Ram 1500 model:\n\n* The Lone Star Silver Edition, available exclusively at Ram dealerships in [[Texas]] and based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, adds additional chrome trim pieces to the trim level. It debuted at the 2016 [[Texas State Fair]].\n* The Lone Star Yellow Rose Edition, also available exclusively at Ram dealerships in Texas and also based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, is available only in a model-exclusive Stinger Yellow Clear Coat exterior paint color. It debuted at the 2016 Texas State Fair.\n* The Night Edition, available at Ram dealerships nationwide, is based on the Sport trim level, and adds black-finished emblems, twenty-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, front grille, door handles, and emblems to the model.\n\nThere is also a new Off-Road Package available for all Ram 2500 models (aside from the Power Wagon trim level, which includes the package as standard equipment), and includes unique pickup bedside graphics, off-road suspension, front tow hooks, and the protection package.\n\nThe mid-level SLT trim level of the RAM 1500 is no longer available to retail customers, as it is now a lesser-equipped model reserved exclusively for fleet customers. However, the SLT trim level still remains for the Ram 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 models, and are still available to retail customers. However, retail customers wanting SLT features such as chrome front and rear bumpers and front grille, seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, power windows and door locks with keyless entry, the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, cloth seating surfaces, [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]], a rear-view backup camera system, and floor carpeting, can still opt for the Chrome Appearance and Popular Equipment Packages on the Tradesman model.\n\nFor customers wanting a less expensive [[Bluetooth]] option for the Ram truck, a new U Connect 3.0BT (RA2) radio is available for an additional $200.00, which includes an A/M-F/M radio and SiriusXM Satellite Radio tuner, Radio Data System (RDS), U Connect Bluetooth hands-free phone system with audio streaming and voice command, steering wheel-mounted remote voice command controls, a USB port and 3.5&nbsp;mm auxiliary audio input jack, and a three-inch (3.0\") monochrome LCD display screen. This radio option is available for the Tradesman trim level of all Ram trucks, and the Express trim level of the Ram 1500, and is included as part of a Popular Equipment Package on the latter model. Previously, customers wanting Bluetooth on a Ram Tradesman or Ram 1500 Express would have to upgrade to the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, which would add the same features as described above, as well as onscreen vehicle customization via the radio, and a full five-inch (5.0\") color touch-screen display, and cost an additional $495.00. In order to do this, the customer would also have to select the Popular Equipment Package on both models.\n\nThe RAM 2500 Power Wagon returned with a 6.4&nbsp;L [[HEMI]] gasoline V8 engine, a unique graphics package (delete option), black front grille, door handles, larger tires and black aluminum-alloy wheels, and the Off-Road Package. The Power Wagon Package is also available for the Ram 2500 Tradesman trim level, and also adds the 6.4L HEMI gasoline V8 engine.\n\n===2018 changes===\nChanges to the Ram for 2018 included the addition of [[HD Radio]] to all U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems, as well as a new [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] wireless hot-spot provided by [[AT&T Wireless]], an AT&T Wireless 4G LTE in-vehicle modem (both the AT&T Wireless 4G LTE modem and 4G LTE mobile hot-spot replace the [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] [[3G]] [[CDMA]] modem and 3G CDMA mobile hot-spot offered on previous Ram models), [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] smartphone integration for the U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems, and the SiriusXM Guardian service replacing the U Connect ACCESS service offered on previous RAM models for the U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems. In addition, all U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems get a new [[User Interface]] design for easier navigation of menus and applications.\n\nThe [[VM Motori]]-produced 3.0&nbsp;L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbodiesel engine returned in early 2018 for the RAM 1500, as it has been re-certified by the [[EPA]] after allegations of emissions cheating in 2017.\n\nMost upper trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Sport, Rebel, Laramie Longhorn, and Limited) get the new RAM front grille introduced for 2016, as well as a large 'RAM' emblem on the rear tailgate. Lower to mid trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Tradesman, Express, Big Horn, Lone Star, and Laramie) retain the standard RAM \"Cross-Hair\" front grille.\n\nThe Night Edition and Lone Star Silver Edition trim levels were continued.\n\nFor 2018, there are two new special editions:\n* The Harvest Edition (also available on the Ram 2500 and 3500), are based on the Big Horn and Lone Star models. Available in only four paint colors, two of which are unique to the Harvest Edition (Case IH Red, New Holland Blue, two-tone Black Clear Coat and Bright Silver Metallic, or Bright White Clear Coat). Aimed at farmers, the Harvest Edition adds features that are otherwise optional on the Big Horn and Lone Star, such as seventeen-inch chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels with all-terrain tires on 4X4 models, the U Connect 8.4 infotainment system with GPS navigation, [[SiriusXM]] Travel Link with five years of service included and one year of SiriusXM Guardian service, a trailer tow package with integrated trailer brake control, rear-mounted tow hitch, and trailer tow side mirrors. Also included are front bucket seats with power front driver's seat trimmed in premium cloth, chrome side steps, chrome side mirror covers, chrome door handles, and chrome front tow hooks. It is available as either a Quad Cab or a Crew Cab.\n* The Laramie Longhorn Southfork Edition Package, available on 1500, 2500, and 3500 Laramie Longhorn models, adds even more luxury features to the already luxurious truck, such as unique twenty-inch polished aluminum-alloy wheels, unique real wood interior trim, and a unique two-tone blue-and-beige interior color scheme.\n\n===2019 changes===\n\nFor 2019, the current fourth-generation Ram 1500 will be sold alongside its successor, the fifth-generation Ram 1500. Virtually identical to 2018 models, 2019 trucks will be given a new name, '''Ram 1500 Classic''', to distinguish them from their all-new fifth-generation successors. The Ram 1500 Classic will offer a 2-Door Regular Cab model, whereas the fifth-generation Ram 1500 will not. In addition, Quad and Crew Cab models are also expected to be offered.<ref name=\"allpar.com\"/>\n\nIn addition, the current-generation '''Ram 2500''', '''Ram 3500''', and '''Ram 3500/4500/5500 Chassis Cab''' models will be redesigned for the 2019 [[model year]].<ref>https://www.autoblog.com/2019/01/14/2019-ram-heavy-duty-revamp-1000-lb-ft-cummins/</ref>\n\n===Production===\nThe Ram 1500, Ram Mega Cab, Ram 2500/3500, DX Chassis Cab (Mexico Market), Ram 4500/5500 are assembled at FCA's Saltillo Assembly Plant in Coahuila, Mexico; the Ram 1500 (DT) is assembled at [[Sterling Heights Assembly]] (SHAP) in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Chrysler Group LLC Manufacturing Operations |url= http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?id=9117&mid=18}}</ref> The Ram 1500 (DS) was previously assembled at [[Warren Truck Assembly]] in [[Warren, Michigan]].\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Model\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n|-\n|rowspan=6|1500||2013\u20132018||{{convert|220|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler Pentastar engine|Pentastar]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||{{convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|269|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2009\u20132012||{{convert|226|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} '' 3.7 '' V6 ||{{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|235|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2009\u20132013||{{convert|287|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} '' 4.7 '' [[V8 engine|V8]]||{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2009\u20132012||rowspan=2|{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8 ||{{convert|390|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|407|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2013\u20132018||{{convert|395|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2014\u20132018||{{convert|182|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[List of VM Motori engines#A 630 DOHC|EcoDiesel]]'' V6 [[diesel engine|diesel]] ||{{convert|240|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|420|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|rowspan=12|2500/3500\n|2010\u20132018||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8 ||{{convert|383|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|400|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2014\u2013present||{{convert|392|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8||{{convert|410|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|429|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2010\u20132012||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Cummins B Series engine#ISB|Cummins]]'' diesel [[Straight-six engine|I6]] (6-Speed Manual/Automatic)||{{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|650|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2013\u20132018||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 (6-Speed Manual)||{{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|660|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2013\u20132018||rowspan=2|{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 (68RFE 6-Speed Automatic)||rowspan=2|{{convert|370|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|800|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2019||{{convert|850|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2011.5\u20132012||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} '' Cummins'' diesel I6 (High Output 6-Speed Automatic)||{{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|800|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2013\u20132014||rowspan=5|{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ([[Aisin]] ASC69RC Automatic)||rowspan=4|{{convert|385|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|850|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2015||{{convert|865|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2016\u20132017||{{convert|900|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2018||{{convert|930|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2019||{{convert|400|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|1000|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|rowspan=5|Chassis Cab\n|2010\u20132015<br/>(2010\u2013present in Mexico)||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8||{{convert|383|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|400|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2010\u20132012||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2013\u20132018||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 (6-Speed Manual)||{{convert|320|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|650|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2013\u20132018||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 (Aisin AS69RC Automatic)||{{convert|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|750|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n===Plug-in hybrid===\nA two-mode [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] version was planned to begin production in 2010, but Chrysler decided to cancel it in favor of a smaller test fleet of 140 [[plug-in hybrid]] (PHEV) Rams developed with support from a {{USD|48}} million grant from the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] financed through the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].

All 109 Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrids and 23 [[Chrysler Town & Country#Town & Country Plug-in hybrid|Chrysler Town & Country plug-in hybrid]]s deployed by the program were recalled due to damage sustained by three separate pickup trucks when their 12.9 [[kWh]] battery packs overheated. The carmaker plans to upgrade the battery packs with cells that use a different lithium-ion chemistry before the vehicles go back into service. Chrysler explained that no one was injured from any of the incidents, and the vehicles were not occupied at the time, nor any of the minivans were involved in any incident, but they were withdrawn as a precaution. The demonstration is a program jointly funded by Chrysler and the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] that includes the first-ever factory-produced vehicles capable of reverse power flow. The experimental system would allow fleet operators to use their plug-in hybrids to supply electricity for a building during a power outage, reduce power usage when electric rates are high or even sell electricity back to their utility company.<ref name=Chrysler>{{cite web|url= http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1079368_chrysler-yanks-plug-in-hybrid-test-fleet-off-roads-will-replace-batteries|title=Chrysler Yanks Plug-In Hybrid Test Fleet Off Roads, Will Replace Batteries|first=John |last=Voelcker |publisher=Green Car Reports |date=2012-09-24|accessdate=2012-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120924/AUTO0101/209240429 |title=Chrysler halts tests on plug-in hybrid fleet after batteries overheat |first=Bryce G. |last=Hoffman |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=2012-09-24 |accessdate=2012-09-30 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The company reported that the demonstration fleet had collectively accumulated 1.3 million miles (2.1 million km) before the vehicles were recalled.

The current [[Ram Pickup (fifth generation)|'''fifth-generation Ram''']] debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show#2018|2018 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], Michigan in January of that year.\n\nPreviously, Ram was part of the [[Dodge]] line of light trucks. The name ''Ram'' was first used in 1981 Dodge Trucks following the retiring and rebadging of the [[Dodge D Series]] pickup trucks as well as B-series vans, though the company had used a ram's-head hood ornament on some trucks as early as 1933.<ref name=\"ED-DRG\">{{cite web |title= Dodge Ram - Generations |url= http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46028 |publisher= Edmunds.com |first= John |last= DiPietro | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080801102809/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D46028 |archivedate= 2008-08-01 |url-status= dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nRam trucks have been named ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year| Truck of the Year]] seven times; the second-generation Ram won the award in 1994, the third-generation Ram ''Heavy Duty'' won the award in 2003, the fourth-generation Ram Heavy Duty won in 2010 and the fourth-generation Ram 1500 won in 2013 and 2014, and the current [[Ram Pickup (fifth generation)|fifth-generation]] Ram 1500 won in 2019 and 2020. \n \n{{TOC left}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==First generation (1981; D/W)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = 89DodgeRam F34.jpg\n| caption = 1989 Ram D100\n| production = 1981\u20131993\n| platform = [[Chrysler AD platform]]\n| body_style = 2-door pickup truck<br />2-door extended cab pickup truck<br />4-door crew cab pickup truck\n| wheelbase = Regular cab/6.5' bed:<br />{{convert|115|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Regular cab/8' bed:<br />{{convert|131|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Club Cab/6.5' bed:<br />{{convert|133|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Club Cab/8' bed:<br />{{convert|149|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Crew cab/8' bed:<br />{{convert|165|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n| length = {{convert|190.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br /> {{convert|210.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|76|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />{{convert|73|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine = {{convert|225|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine#225|slant-6]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br />{{convert|239|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine#239 V6|LA V6]]<br />{{convert|318|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|LA V8]]<br />{{convert|360|cuin|L|abbr=on}} LA V8<br />{{convert|5.9|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Cummins B Series engine#B5.9|Cummins]] [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n| transmission = 3- or 4-speed ''[[Torqueflite]]'' automatic<br />4- or 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n| related = [[Dodge Ramcharger]]\n}}\n\nThe first-generation Ram trucks and vans introduced in 1981 featured a Ram hood ornament first used on Dodge vehicles from 1932 to 1954.<ref name=\"ED-DRG\">{{cite web |title=Dodge Ram - Generations |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46028 |publisher=Edmunds.com |first=John |last=DiPietro |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080801102809/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D46028 |archivedate=2008-08-01 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref> Not all of the first-generation trucks have this ornament and is most commonly seen on [[four-wheel-drive]] models. Dodge kept the previous generation's model designations: \"D\" or ''Ram'' indicated [[two-wheel drive]] while \"W\" or ''Power Ram'' indicated [[four-wheel drive]]. Just like [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], Dodge used 150 to indicate a half-ton truck, 250 for a three-quarter-ton truck, and 350 for a one-ton truck. The truck models were offered in standard cab, \"Club\" extended cab, and crew cab configurations. They also were offered along with {{convert|6.5|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} bed lengths and \"Utiline\" and \"Sweptline\" styled boxes along with standard boxes. Externally, the first-generation Rams were facelifted versions of the previous generation Dodge D-Series pickups introduced in 1972. The new model introduced larger wraparound [[Automotive lighting|tail lamps]], dual rectangular [[headlamp]]s, and squared-off body lines. Engine choices were pared down to the [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|225 Slant-6]] and [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|318]] and [[Chrysler LA engine#360 V8|360 V8s]]. The interior was updated and included a new bench seat and a completely new dashboard and instrument cluster with an optional three-pod design - a speedometer in the center, with the two side pods containing an ammeter on the top left, a temperature gauge bottom left, a fuel gauge on the top right and an oil pressure gauge bottom right. Models without the full gauge package had only indicator lights in the place of the temperature and oil pressure gauges. Among the options offered on the Ram were front bumper guards, a sliding rear cab window, air-conditioning, cruise control, tilt steering column, power door locks and windows, AM/FM stereo with cassette tape player, styled road wheels, aluminum turbine-style mag wheels, special paint and stripe packages, two-tone paint, and a plow package for four-wheel-drive models (referred to as the Sno Commander).\n\nThe \"Club Cab\" was dropped from the lineup after 1982, but Dodge kept the tooling and re-introduced nearly a decade later in the 1991 models. The four-door crew cab and Utiline beds were dropped after the 1985 model year, to make room on the assembly line for the upcoming 1987 [[Dodge Dakota]], and were never reintroduced in this generation.\n\nBasic Ram 100 models were reintroduced for 1984, replacing the previous \"Miser\" trim level available on the Ram 150. A \"Ram-Trac\" shift-on-the-fly transfer case was added for the 1985 Power Rams, and both the crew cab and Utiline flared bed were dropped for 1986. In 1988 the Slant-6 engine was replaced by a {{convert|3.9|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler LA engine#239 V6|V6]] engine. The {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine also received [[electronic fuel injection]] in 1988. Because of a new computer controlled fuel injection, ignition and ABS system, more vehicle information needed to be displayed through any warning or notification lights; so inside the cab where a small compartment was once located on the dash, a new \"message center\" with four small rectangular light spots, contained the [[check engine light]] and other [[Tell-tale (automotive)|tell-tales]] including one for the parking brake and the [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] if the truck was so equipped. The message center later included \"Wait to Start\" and \"Water in Fuel\" lights on diesel models. Diagnostic fault codes were stored in the computer's memory, and cycling the ignition key three times would allow the computer to flash the trouble codes through the check-engine light for diagnosis of some problems.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/fix/80s-codes.html |title=Retrieving fault codes |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=2010-11-22}}</ref> Rear [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] became standard equipment in 1989.\n\nThe Ram 100 model designation was dropped and these models folded back into the 150 range for 1990, due to the introduction and sales success of the [[Dodge Dakota]] pickup. Additionally, the instrument cluster was slightly revised; the [[ammeter]] was replaced by a [[voltmeter]] while maintaining the 3-pod arrangement of the speedometer and gauges. Also in 1990, Dodge reintroduced the Club Cab, equipped with fold-out jump seats for the 1991-1993 models. Entry was made through the passenger or driver's doors, as there were no rear doors for this configuration.\n\nThese trucks, though popular with fleets, sold poorly compared to the [[Ford F-Series]] and the [[Chevrolet C/K|General Motors C/K Trucks]], with just under 100,000 units sold most years of their production. Part of this was due to the dated cab and chassis design which had been in production since 1972, there was no powerful diesel option until 1989, and there was no big-block gas V8 option. Additionally, the interior had been given few updates since 1981.\n\n===Engines & transmissions===\nFor 1989, the 5.9&nbsp;L V8 received throttle-body [[fuel injection]] for a 20&nbsp;hp (15&nbsp;kW) gain. Additionally, Dodge introduced a new [[Torqueflite|overdrive automatic transmission]] for reduced fuel consumption. This light-duty transmission was designated the A500, and was offered with the 3.9&nbsp;L V6 and 5.2&nbsp;L V8. An \"O/D Off\" pushbutton switch to lock out the overdrive 4th gear was added to the message center. The [[TorqueFlite#A727 .2836RH.2F37RH.29|A727 automatic]] saw continued use for some 5.2&nbsp;L engines, all 5.9&nbsp;L engines, and heavy-duty applications.\n\nThe grille was redesigned for 1991 but kept the large rectangular [[headlamp]]s and crossbar appearance. The engines were substantially [[Chrysler LA engine|upgraded]] for 1992 (3.9&nbsp;L and 5.2&nbsp;L) 1993 and 1994 (5.9&nbsp;L) with multi-port fuel injection, new manifolds, and higher-compression cylinder heads for noticeably higher output. These newly-revised engines were marketed under the \"Magnum\" name. A heavy-duty automatic transmission with overdrive called the [[TorqueFlite#A518 .2846RH.2F46RE.29|A518]] was offered with the 5.2&nbsp;L and 5.9&nbsp;L engines. As part of Chrysler's overhaul of corporate transmission nomenclature, the A500 and A518 were redesignated 42RH and 46RH, respectively, in 1992. The initial \"4\" signified a 4-speed transmission, the second digit identified the transmission's relative torque capacity, the letter \"R\" in the third position denoted a rear-wheel-drive transmission, and the final letter \"H\" signified hydraulic shift control. The 3-speed automatic remained available; the A727 was redesignated 36RH, and the A904, A998, and A999 became the 30RH, 31RH, and 32RH, respectively.\n\n====5.9 Cummins====\n[[File:1993 Dodge Ram W250 Club Cab 4x4 Cummins td.jpg|thumb|1993 W250 Club Cab]]\nA [[Cummins B Series engine]] was also added to the engine lineup in 1989.<ref name=\"AllparCummins\">{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/cummins-diesel.html |title=Cummins 5.9-liter and 6.7-liter inline six-cylinder diesel engines |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-24}}</ref> For the first time, Dodge saw sales increase. The Cummins was coupled with a heavier-duty version of the [[TorqueFlite#A727|A727 automatic]] or a 5-speed [[manual transmission]] and is available on 250 and 350 pickups and pickup-based chassis-cab trucks. This diesel engine option was different from the optional diesels in Ford and GM trucks. The Cummins features direct injection, whereas the Ford and GM diesels feature [[indirect injection]]; this also means that the Cummins does not have to rely on [[glowplug]]s. The Cummins is a [[straight-six engine]], whereas the GM and Ford diesel engines are V8 engines. Additionally, the Cummins is [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]], while the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine|6.2&nbsp;L GM/DDC]] and [[International Harvester IDI|7.3 IDI Ford/IH]] are [[naturally aspirated]].<ref name=\"AllparCummins\"/>\n\nPre-1994 Cummins-engined Dodge pickups are often termed a \"First-Gen Cummins\".\n\nThis was not the first engine to appear in Dodge pickup trucks as a diesel option.

The original concept, dubbed the \"Louisville Slugger\" by Chrysler's Advanced Packaging Studio, was to be a modular platform that would accommodate a full-size truck and full-size van, which would have provided a roomy cab and cargo bed.<ref name=\"Jalopnik\">{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/the-original-design-for-the-second-gen-dodge-ram-was-a-1825251176 |title=The Original Design For The Second-Gen Dodge Ram Was A Styling Disaster |author=Westbrook, Justin T. |work=Jalopnik |date=August 13, 2018 |accessdate=November 5, 2018}}</ref> The modular design was scrapped in 1987 and was replaced with a more conventional truck design when the design was moved to the [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] design studio.<ref name=\"Jalopnik\"/> The more conventional design, dubbed \"Phoenix\", was originally scheduled for a 1991 production; when Bob Lutz showed it to the new styling designers, chief designer Phillip E. Payne told him, \"It looks like nothing more than a rehash of everybody else's truck.\" At that, Lutz told him he had six months to come up with something better.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autosofinterest.com/2012/07/21/design-notes-1994-dodge-ram-truck/ |title=Design Notes: 1994 Dodge Ram Truck |publisher=Autos of Interest |date=2012-07-21 |accessdate=2015-06-29}}</ref> The exterior styling of the truck that was eventually released was the result of design concepts by Payne during 1988-1990. A review by the Dodge pick-up truck studio designers felt that modern pick-ups looked \"too flat and sedan-like\", while the [[Studebaker E-series truck|early 1950s Studebaker pick-up]] and the [[semi-trailer truck]]s had just the right \"macho\" look to them.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=29&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=%22dodge+ram%22&OS=%22dodge+ram%22&RS=%22dodge+ram%22 |title=U.S. Patent D396,828 - Body Styling of 1994 Dodge Ram |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |date=August 11, 1998 |accessdate=2010-11-22}}</ref> The design featured a [[big rig|big-rig]]-looking front end and a large grille that was deemed risky at its introduction, but ultimately proved popular with consumers.<ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\">{{cite web |url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/ram-1500/1994/1994-dodge-ram-1500-laramie-slt/ |title=1994 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie SLT - Long-Term Wrap-Up |author=Killeen, Scott |work=Motor Trend |date=February 1, 1996 |accessdate=February 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nMaking its debut on January 5, 1993 at the [[North American International Auto Show]] and going on sale on October 1, 1993, the redesigned 1994 Ram was a sales success and was named \"[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]]\" by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' in 1994.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/06/business/company-news-new-pickup-is-displayed-by-chrysler.html</ref><ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\"/> Sales increased from 95,542 units in 1993 to 232,092 in 1994, 410,000 in 1995, and 411,000 by 1996. That year, it was prominently featured as the hero vehicle in the film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1996/06/01/reels-and-reels-of-wheels/cf2cbd8b-c945-47ac-9c31-3e970910fca7/?noredirect=on |title=Reels and Reels of Wheels |first=Warren |last=Brown |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 1, 1996 |accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.motorious.com/articles/news/315749/twister-replica-dodge-ram-sure-to-kick-up-a-storm-at-auction |title=Twister Replica Dodge Ram Sure To Kick Up A Storm At Auction |first=Tyler |last=Heatley |website=Motorious |date=March 28, 2019 |accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> Sales of this generation peaked at just over 400,000 in 1999 before declining against the redesigned [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks. By 2001, Ram sales figures were below those of Ford and Chevy trucks.\n\nEngine offerings continued over from the first-generation Ram and were the 3.9&nbsp;L V6, 5.2&nbsp;L V8, 5.9&nbsp;L V8, and 5.9&nbsp;L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] Cummins turbo diesel. Added to the line up was a new 488 cubic inch 8.0L V10 engine designed as an alternative for those who wanted superior pulling power but did not want a diesel. The new [[V10 engine|V10]] and Cummins turbo diesel could only be had in the 2500 and higher designation models. Models were now the 1500 half-ton, 2500 three-quarter-ton, and 3500 dual-rear-wheel one-ton in both 2- and 4-wheel drive. 1500 Rams offered both 6.5- and 8-foot (2 and 2.4 m, respectively) boxes. 2500 Rams offered {{convert|6.5|ft|m|adj=on}} boxes with club or quad Cabs.\n\nDodge offered the 2500 series in two different gross-vehicle-weight ratings for the first few years, but this was later dropped. The purpose of the difference between the light-duty and heavy-duty 2500 trucks was for the heavy-duty 2500 to take the place of the discontinued one-ton single-rear-wheel trucks. Rear axles for the light-duty 2500 trucks were [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|semi-floating]], while the heavy-duty 2500 rear axles were [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|full-floating]].\n\nOn the inside, special attention was paid to in-cab storage features, with a large glovebox, a center armrest storage area, and extra storage space behind the seat. The dash and gauge cluster were a far cry from the previous model Ram and were far more modern as well. A redesign of the dashboard and instrument cluster was introduced in 1998 along with the introduction of the quad cab, and rounded black plastic side-view mirrors replaced the previous rectangular design.\n\n===1998 updates===\nIn 1998, Dodge introduced the \"Quad Cab\", which uses smaller, [[suicide doors]] directly behind the main doors. This was offered as an option on the \"Club Cab\" for this model year. Other changes for 1998 included rounded mirrors replacing the classic square ones, a revised interior, dual airbags, a chime replacing the buzzer for seat belts/door ajar/headlights/ and a digital [[odometer]]. The [[OBD II]] System was also standard, with a computer port near the driver's-side footwell and a code-checking system via the new digital [[odometer]] readout.\n\nIn late 1998 Dodge introduced a revised front end for the 1999 model year Sport models with a restyled bumper, quad-beam clear-lens [[headlamp]]s, and body-color grille. A 6-speed manual transmission was made optional for diesel variants in late 2000 for the 2001 model year. A small percentage of the diesel engines for 1999 and 2000 model years were subject to problems within the water jackets and fuel injectors. The most problematic was the \"53\" stamped engine block which had a defect that would cause fracturing in the structure of the block itself. The 2000 models became optional with heated leather seats. The braking system was upgraded to dual-piston calipers in the front. An Offroad Edition was offered as a package with a 2-inch lift accomplished with stiffer front springs and rear lift blocks, unique 17x8 wheels, 275/70/17 all terrain tires, 4.10 gears, trussed Dana 44 in the front, limited slip differential, and skid plates.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/ram1.html |title=200 Dodge Ram specifications |publisher=pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=January 27, 2014}}</ref> The Offroad Edition models are also distinguishable with an additional decal on the tailgate under the 4x4 decal that says \"Offroad.\"\n\nAlthough Dodge introduced a new Ram 1500 for 2002, the old second-generation style Ram was carried over for the 2002 model year heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 trucks. The new third-generation Ram would not appear in the 2500/3500 variants until 2003. Part of this delay was due to the then new 5.7&nbsp;L Hemi engine not being ready for production.\n\n====Mexico====\n{{main|Dodge Ramcharger}}\nUnencumbered by CAFE ([[Corporate average fuel economy]]) restrictions, DaimlerChrysler's Mexican subsidiary developed a three-door wagon version of the Ram, called the [[Dodge Ramcharger|Ram Charger]] as was its predecessor. It first appeared in 1998 but was never available in the United States.<ref name=SS03>{{cite book | ref = SS03 | title = Katalog Samochody \u015awiata 2003 | trans-title = World Car Catalogue 2003 | editor-first = Eligiusz | editor-last = Mazur | publisher = Print Shops Prego - Polska Sp. z o.o. | location = Warsaw, Poland | page = 217 | date = 2002 | issn = 1234-8198 }}</ref>\n\n===Drivetrain===\n\n====Transmissions====\nTransmissions for the Ram\n*[[TorqueFlite|A500/42RH-RE]] lower geared light duty applications found behind the 3.9 L V6\n*[[TorqueFlite|A518/46RH-RE]] for more heavy duty applications found behind the 5.2 L and 5.9 L V8 engines.\n*[[TorqueFlite|A618/47RH-RE]] for heavy duty use behind the V10 gasoline and Cummins diesel engines. The 47RH was used in 1994 and 1995 model years, while the 47RE was used from 1996 through 2002.\n[[New Venture Gear 3500 transmission|NV3500]] was offered in 1500 Rams and light-duty 2500 Rams.\n[[New Venture Gear 4500 transmission|NV4500]] was standard in 2500 and 3500 trucks; the NV4500HD for V10 and diesel models (''except the uncommon, light-duty 2500 rams'').\nA [[New Venture Gear 5600 transmission|NV5600]] was offered in 1999 and 2000 Rams and was the only transmission offered behind the High Output diesel in 2001 and 2002.\n\n====Transfer cases====\nThere were a total of five [[transfer case]]s available for the four-wheel-drive Ram. All are part-time and have a low range of 2.72:1. The 1500 featured a NP231 and NP231HD. The NP241 was standard on V8 2500 Rams. The 2500 and 3500 V10 and diesel featured a NP241DLD from 1993 to 1997. In 1997 the NP241DHD became an option for 2500 Rams and was standard on 3500 Rams from 1998 to 2002.\n\n====Axles====\nThe Dodge Ram features a wide variety of axles. For the front axle of 4x4 Rams, a [[Dana 44]] was used on all 1500 Rams and the early (light-duty) 2500 Rams. However, most of the 2500 and all 3500 Rams use [[Dana 60]] front axles. The 1500 Rams and some early light duty 2500 Rams used a 9.25 Chrysler (Spicer) axle in the rear. A [[Dana 60]] rear axle was used on heavy duty 2500 V8 Rams. A [[Dana 70]] rear axle was used in 2500 Rams with a V10 or a Diesel/Automatic transmission combination. A [[Dana 80]] rear axle was used on 2500 Rams with a manual transmission and V10/diesel engine combination. Every 3500 Ram was made with a Dana 80. The front drive axles in these Rams were unique in the fact they did not have [[locking hubs]], but featured a [[center axle disconnect]]. The 2002 2500 and 3500 Rams saw the eventual phase out of the Center axle disconnect, in favor of front axles that were permanently locked in. Dodge continued to include front axles like this for their 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 trucks until 2013 models.\n\n===Engines===\nA [[natural gas|natural-gas-powered]] engine debuted for 1995 but was not popular and was only used in fleet vehicles on a very limited production run. The [[Cummins B Series engine]] was switched from the 12-valve to the 24-valve (ISB) version in the middle of the 1998 model-year Dodge Rams due to emissions regulations. The ISB featured a new computer-controlled electronic injection pump and 24-valve head design.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n!8th VIN\n|-\n|{{nowrap|1994\u20132001}}||{{convert|239|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 3.9L|Magnum]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||{{convert|175|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|225|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}|| X\n|-\n|1994\u20132001||{{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.2|Magnum]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]||{{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>|| Y\n|-\n|1995\u20131997||{{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} Natural Gas V8 ||{{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|430|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||\n|-\n|1994\u20131997||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|325|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||Z (5 for the heavy-duty version)\n|-\n|1998\u20132002||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|245|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|335|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||Z (5 for the heavy-duty version)\n|-\n|1994\u20132002||{{convert|488|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref>[http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/attachments/08192002_VIPER_OVERVIEW.pdf Chapter 3 for 2003: Dodge Viper SRT-10] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320113521/http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/attachments/08192002_VIPER_OVERVIEW.pdf |date=March 20, 2009 }}.

It included longitudinal stripes similar to those on the Dodge Viper along with an optional door sticker stating \"Official Truck of the 80th Indianapolis 500\". These trucks had a {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine with upgraded exhaust and {{convert|15|hp|abbr=on}} more power. These also included {{convert|17|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheels with Goodyear Eagle II 275/60R-17 tires. The SS/T (Super Sport Truck) version was available from 1997 to 1998 and included all the same upgrades except the door sticker. The SS/T also had \"SS/T\" designed into the stripe on both the hood and tailgate. The Indy Trucks were available only in blue with white stripes.

This was a major update including an all new frame, suspension, powertrains, interiors, and sheet metal. The crew cab models for this generation were actually Quad Cab trucks that had conventional-opening rear doors. The four-wheel-drive light trucks (1500 series) lost their [[live axle]]s in favor of an [[independent suspension|independent front suspension]], but the 2500 and 3500 series retained the live axles for maximum longevity and durability; rear-wheel-drive 2500 & 3500 had class-exclusive rack and pinion steering for their independent front suspension (the 1500 also received rack and pinion steering for the first time). This body style drew heavily from the previous generation.\n\nThe redesigned trucks bolstered sales, with 400,000 sold during 2001-2002 and nearly 450,000 sold during 2002-2003, a new high point for the Ram name. At the same time, both [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks were increasing in sales from a 2001 peak over 850,000 to the 900,000 range. But with 400,543 Rams sold that year, the Ram's sales could not keep up with the eleventh-generation [[Ford F-Series eleventh generation|F-150]] in 2004.\n\n===2006 Facelift===\n\n[[File:2006-2008 Dodge Ram 1500 -- 03-16-2012.JPG|thumb|left|2006\u20132008 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab]]\n\nThe Dodge Ram was updated for the 2006 model year. One notable addition was the \"Mega Cab\", featuring a {{convert|6.25|ft|m|0|adj=on}} cargo box and {{convert|22|in|0|abbr=}} of extra cab space, allowing seating for six with rear recliners, a full screen mapping in-dash navigation system became an option, and the [[headlamp]]s were redesigned to a more modern design.\n\nFor 2006, the [[steering wheel]] design was changed to one from the [[Dodge Dakota]] and [[Dodge Durango]]. [[Bluetooth]] [[U Connect]] was now available as an option, and a front facelift was given to all Ram models. [[SIRIUS Satellite Radio]] was available, as well was a rear seat [[DVD]] entertainment system with wireless [[headphones]]. The [[Street and Racing Technology|SRT]] model, with the 8.3&nbsp;L [[V10 engine]] from the [[Dodge Viper]] SRT/10, was discontinued after the 2006 [[model year]].\n\nFor 2007, Dodge changed the tail lights.\n\n===Chassis Cab===\nIn 2007, a 3500 Chassis Cab model was introduced with industry-standard rear frame width and wiring to accommodate outfitters. In addition to the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}, a [[Cummins]] {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[diesel engine|diesel]] rated at {{convert|350|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|650|lbft|0|abbr=on}} was also available. Automatic transmissions used were the [[Chrysler RFE transmission|545RFE]] with the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} and the [[List of Aisin transmissions|AS68RC]] with the {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The G56 transmission was the only manual transmission offered.\n\nFor 2008, Dodge introduced two more Chassis Cab models, the 4500 and 5500. These were [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class-4]] and [[Truck classification#Class 5|Class-5]] trucks with a gross weight of {{convert|16500|lb|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19500|lb|0|abbr=on}}, respectively. Both trucks came equipped with the same version of the [[Cummins]] {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[diesel engine|diesel]] as the 3500 chassis-cab model. [[Sterling Trucks|Sterling]], who worked with Dodge in development, had their own version, called the [[Sterling Bullet]] with a unique grille. Sterling is a division of [[Freightliner LLC]] which, like Dodge, was owned by the former [[DaimlerChrysler]]. [[Sterling Trucks]] was licensed to sell Dodge Ram 4500 series trucks as the Sterling Bullet. When the [[Sterling Trucks|Sterling]] brand was phased out by [[Chrysler Corporation]], the Bullet was discontinued.\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Model\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n|-\n|rowspan=5|1500||2002-2008||{{convert|226|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler PowerTech engine#3.7 EKG|Magnum]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||{{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|235|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|2002-2007||{{convert|287|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Magnum'' V8 ||{{convert|235|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|2008-2013||{{convert|287|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Magnum'' V8 ||{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=semihemi>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/47.html| title = The 4.7 Liter \"Next Generation\" and \"semi-Hemi\" V8 Engine (Dodge ) | work = Allpar.com: Trucks | publisher = Allpar LLC | first = Rick | last = Ehrenberg | accessdate = 2014-03-15 }}</ref>||{{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=semihemi/>\n|-\n|2002-2003||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|245|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|335|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|2003-2008||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine#New Hemi|Hemi]]'' V8 ||{{convert|345|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|375|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |2500/3500\n|2009||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8 ||{{convert|390|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002-2003 SO \"6\" Vin Designation||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Cummins B Series engine#ISB|Cummins]]'' [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]||{{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002\u20132003 SO California Emissions||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|235|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}||{{convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002-2004 HO \"C\" Vin Designation||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6||{{convert|305|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}||{{convert|555|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2004.5-2007 HO||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|325|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}||{{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2007-2009||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|650|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002-2003||{{convert|488|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Magnum V10|Magnum]]'' [[V10 engine|V10]]||{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|450|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Chassis Cab\n|2008\u20132009||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine#New Hemi|Hemi]]'' V8 (3500 Only)||{{convert|345|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|375|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2009||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8 (3500 Only)||{{convert|388|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|404|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2008\u20132009||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|SRT-10||2004-2006||{{convert|505|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Viper engine#Second generation|Viper]]'' [[V10 engine|V10]]||{{convert|510|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|535|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\nModels built after January 1, 2007 offered a new 6.7 L Cummins turbo diesel introduced as an option in 2500/3500 models replacing the 5.9 L.

This new Hemi still delivered {{convert|345|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|375|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Axles===\nFor the 2003 model year, AAM axles replaced the Dana Corp axles. In the front all 2500 and 3500 trucks were 9.25-inch with 33 spline axles. The rear options for the 2500 and 3500 were the AAM (often referred to as \"corporate\") [[10.5\" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#10.5 AAM|10.5]]\" and [[10.5\" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#11.5 AAM|11.5]]\". Rear axle shafts are 30 spline. The rear 11.5\" has a gear ratio \"carrier split\" at 3.73 and numerically higher, but the General Motors AAM axles used a different carrier spacing preventing installation of a Chrysler carrier into some GM axles, but the GM carrier can be installed in the Chrysler axle if a ring gear spacer is installed. Strength is similar to their earlier Dana 70 and 80 counterparts. Direct comparisons are difficult as the axles are made with completely different [[metallurgy]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:3rd Gen.jpg|2003 Dodge Ram diesel dually quad cab 2wd with the 5.9L Cummins Turbodiesel I6\nFile:2002-05 Dodge Ram.jpg|2005 Dodge Ram 1500 quad cab with the 5.7L Hemi V8\nFile:Dodge-Ram-Mega-Cab.jpg|Dodge Ram 2500 Mega Cab\nFile:Sterling Bullet.jpg|Sterling Bullet, a version of the Ram sold by [[Sterling Trucks]] with the 6.7L Cummins Diesel I6\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Special editions===\n* '''HemiSport''' - The HemiSport Edition was the Quad Cab version of the Rumble Bee, and was introduced in 2004.

It includes lower body cladding, 20\" wheels, a hood scoop, and an SLT interior specially trimmed with yellow dashboard and door panel inserts and a serialized number plate. On the rear of the box is a stripe with a \"Rumble Bee\" emblem, similar to that of the [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]].

Introduced in 2004 and only made in 2004 and 2005, these were customized by LA West of Indiana as ordered from dealers, adding an additional $8,300.50 in sticker price. It was available on regular-cab/short-box and quad-cab/short-box pickups and include a custom overall paint from Mopar's Impact colors from the 1970s (this includes Hemi Orange, Plum Crazy Purple, Sublime Green, and Banana Yellow). 20\" American Racing Motto chrome wheels, a new cowl \"blacked-out\" hood, and a specially trimmed leather 2-tone interior including a serialized number plate on the driver's-side doorjamb were offered. On the sides is a \"hockey-stick\" stripe with \"HEMI GTX\" that extended from the hood to the rear of the box. The air box was also painted to match the body color, and a color-matched steering wheel was added as well. They were only 433 produced in 2004 and roughly the same number in 2005.

It was available as a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 in Regular or Quad-Cab styles and featured lower-body cladding, 20-inch chrome wheels, SRT-10 hood, Borla dual exhaust, serialized number plate, and a tall rear spoiler reminiscent of the 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]]. The Daytonas had a black body stripe to match the rear spoiler and came in silver or \"Go Mango\" paint (a metallic orange color reminiscent of the Dodge's \"high impact\" colors from the 1960s and 1970s) with matching interior trim. The Dodge Ram Daytona had a 3.92 ratio rear end, the same rear end as the Dodge Ram Rumble Bee. Several exterior items were unique to the Daytona package (such as the gas door and dual side exit exhaust tips) which made it different from other equipment packages. It was equipped with {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} [[chrome plating|chrome]] wheels and performance tires. Replacing the standard hood is one with a non-functional [[hood scoop]]. The most noticeable feature is the large [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] which is attached at the rear of the cargo box.

This is because the competitors stopped making manual transmissions available in the domestic market. [[Chevrolet Silverado]] trucks discontinued the option of a manual transmission after model year 2006. [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks discontinued the option of a manual transmission after model year 2010. This applies to [[Truck classification#Class 2|Class 2]], [[Truck classification#Class 3|Class 3]], [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class 4]] and [[Truck classification#Class 5|Class 5]] trucks. 2011 and 2012 models make {{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

The 3500 Heavy Duty model was unveiled at the 2009 [[Chicago Auto Show]].\n\nEngine choices include 5.7&nbsp;L Hemi V8 rated at {{convert|383|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|542|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm for Ram 3500, 6.7 l Cummins turbo diesel rated at {{convert|350|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 3,013 rpm and {{convert|880|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 1,500 rpm for Ram 3500 (optional), 4500, 5500. Late-model 2011 diesel trucks were up-rated to {{convert|800|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nTransmission choices included a standard 6-speed manual or optional 6-speed [[Aisin]] automatic. Both transmissions support the Power Takeoff option.\n\nThe 3500 model has regular or crew cab, single-rear-wheel or dual-rear-wheel. Four cab-axle lengths (60, 84, 108 and 120&nbsp;inches) for 4500/5500 or two cab-axle lengths (60 and 84&nbsp;inches) for 3500, and three trim levels (ST, SLT and Laramie).\n\nThe Ram 3500 has three axle ratios (3.42, 3.73 and 4.10) and 17-inch wheels. Ram 4500/5500 has three axle ratios (4.10, 4.44 and 4.88) and 19.5-inch wheels. The 4500/5500 Rams rear axle is a [[Dana S 110]]. The front axle on 4x4 models is manufactured by [[Magna International|Magna]], while 2-wheel-drive models just have a solid, non-drive axle.\n\n====Concept truck====\nThe Ram concept truck \"Long Hauler\" from 2012 is based mostly on existing Ram truck parts. The powertrain, frame and wheels are all components of the Ram 5500 Chassis Cab. It is a \"Mega Cab\" optional on the lighter Rams. The [[Gross combined weight rating|GCWR]] for this truck is 37,500&nbsp;lb and the weight of the truck is 9,300&nbsp;lb.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/concepts/ram/long-hauler.html|title=Long Hauler |accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2013 changes===\n[[File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 01 China 2014-04-24.jpg|thumb|2013 Ram 1500]]\n[[File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 02 China 2014-04-24.jpg|thumb|2013 Ram 1500]]\n\nThe 1500 gets a minor restyling. It features new front fascia, optional projector beam halogen headlamps with [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] turn signals/parking lamps, wheels and interior, where the \"DODGE\" name was removed from the dashboard and replaced with \"RAM\".\n\nAll models offered for 2012 continue to be available for 2013 with the addition of a new trim, the Laramie, Longhorn, Limited. (Tradesman, Express, SLT, Big Horn, Lone Star, Sport, R/T, Laramie, and Laramie Longhorn). The Rambox cargo management system continues to be available on most models for 2013. For 2013, the base ST model becomes the Tradesman model.\n\n2013 models have revised engine and transmission options. The 3.7&nbsp;L V6 is discontinued, and the 4.7&nbsp;L V8 equipped with the 6-speed 65RFE Automatic takes its place as the new base engine, still producing {{convert|310|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. New to the lineup is Chrysler's corporate 3.6&nbsp;L Pentastar V6, coupled to the new [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 8-speed Torqueflite8 Automatic. It achieves best in class fuel efficiency and makes {{convert|305|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|269|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}. The Pentastar/ZF 8-speed is optional. Due to a new electric power steering system, the 5.7&nbsp;L HEMI V8 no longer has a power steering pump, and gains 5 horsepower, now making {{convert|395|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. It is still available with the 65RFE 6-speed Automatic, with the new 8-speed Torqueflite8 Automatic optional.\n\n[[Air suspension]] is optional for 2013 models, offering four ride height settings. [[Electronic stability control]] becomes standard on 2500 and 3500 models. For 2013, the Ram is also the first North American pickup truck to offer [[Smart key|keyless ignition]].\n\nNew infotainment systems are available for the RAM 1500 for 2013:\n\nThe base U Connect 3.0 (RA1) radio includes an AM/FM radio, Radio Data System (RDS), a monochrome LCD display screen, a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack, and a single USB port for charging purposes only.\n\nThe \"up-level\" U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) radio adds a full-color, 5.0-inch color touch-screen display, voice control for phone, a microSD card slot, Bluetooth for phone and A2DP wireless stereo audio streaming capabilities, and vehicle customization options on-screen.\n\nThe \"top-of-the-line\" radios are the U Connect ACCESS 8.4A (RA3) and U Connect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4). These radios add a full-color, 8.4-inch color touch-screen display, full voice control, [[SiriusXM]] satellite radio, the U Connect ACCESS System, featuring roadside assistance and 9-1-1 emergency call buttons on the rear-view mirror, mobile app compatibility, remote USB ports for integration of compatible devices, enhanced in-vehicle customization options, automatic notification of airbag deployment, concierge services, remote control via an app installed on a compatible [[smartphone]], and the ability to add GPS navigation from [[Garmin]] for vehicles not equipped with the option from the factory (it is activated by a dealership for a fee, however, does not include SiriusXM Travel Link or 3D mapping). The U Connect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4) adds GPS navigation from Garmin, [[HD Radio]] SiriusXM Travel Link, 3D mapping, and enhanced mobile app compatibility. The system also includes a built-in [[3G]] internet router, allowing for wireless connection to the internet while the vehicle is parked with a monthly service subscription. The system can also be updated to add additional features that will be available in the future via a USB stick inserted into one of the remote USB ports. Remote steering wheel-mounted controls are also included with this system.\n\nOptions such as a CD Player (mounted in the center console of the vehicle), SiriusXM satellite radio  and a Rearview Backup Camera can be added to any radio.\n\n====3500====\nThe 2013 models move up to an 18-inch standard wheel, with 18-inch [[Forging|forged]] [[Alcoa]] wheels as an option. 3500 models offer a High Output package for the diesel. The rear [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] ring gear is increased from 11.5 inches, to 11.8 inches on H.O. trucks. The 11.8 axle cover doubles as a [[heat sink]].\n\n====4x4====\nRam, once again, put the [[Center axle disconnect]] in 3500 4x4 models. 2500 Ram trucks did not have a CAD system until 2014 models. Ram claims this technology to improve fuel efficiency by 1 MPG, although [[EPA]] tests do not include class 2 and class 3 trucks in the [[Miles per gallon|MPG]]/fuel efficiency tests. The 4x4 saw additional changes with the [[transfer case]] now being made by [[BorgWarner]] instead of [[New Venture Gear]].\n\n====High Fuel Efficiency====\nA new model offered for the 2013 Ram is the HFE (High Fuel Efficiency). Based on the SLT model, the HFE offers 18/25 [[Miles per gallon|MPG]] out of its [[Pentastar]] V6 engine and eight-speed [[ZF 8HP transmission|Torque-Flite]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], which has nothing in common with the original Chrysler built [[TorqueFlite]]. It is available only in the six-foot bed, two-door, regular cab model with two-wheel-drive only. Standard features include a 220 amp [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|alternator]] and an 800 amp battery to assist with the [[Start-stop system]]. 3.21:1 axle gearing is also standard.\n\n===2014 changes===\n[[File:2014RAM3500.jpg|thumb|2014 Ram 3500 crew cab, 4\u00d74, DRW]]\nThe option of [[air suspension]] became available on the rear of 2014 model year 2500 and 3500 pick up trucks. 1500 models added the option of an [[List of VM Motori engines#A 630 DOHC|Eco-Diesel V6]]. 2500 models now feature coil spring suspension, instead of leaf spring. The cast iron, flex fuel, 4.7 V8 [[Chrysler PowerTech engine]] was discontinued, ending Corsair engine production, leaving the Ram 1500 with two engine choices. The aluminum, flex fuel 3.6 V6 [[Pentastar]] is now the base engine, along with the 8-speed [[ZF 8HP transmission|Torque-Flite]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]].

This was previously a $495.00 option on the Ram '''SLT'''.\n\n===2017 changes===\nFor 2017, the Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn and Limited trims received the new RAM front grille and \"RAM\" emblem across the rear tailgate that debuted on the 2016 RAM 1500 Rebel.\n\nIn mid-2017, the RAM 1500's 3.0&nbsp;L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbodiesel engine, produced by [[VM Motori]], was dropped in mid-2017 in response to emissions cheating allegations. The engine will be re-introduced in early 2018, as re-certification by the [[EPA]] has been obtained.\n\nThe 1500 SLT model loses the U Connect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) option, leaving the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) radio as the only radio option. However. all Ram heavy-duty (2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500) SLT models will still offer the U Connect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) as an option.\n\nThe Rebel trim level of the Ram 1500 gains the previously-optional U Connect ACCESS 8.4A infotainment system as standard equipment, as do the Big Horn and Lone Star trim levels. A Rebel Black Edition Package is available that adds black accents to the Rebel.\n\nThe Laramie trim level of the Ram 1500, 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 gets a standard nine-speaker, 506-watt [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] 7.1-channel surround-sound premium audio system as standard equipment.\n\nThree new special edition trim levels debut for 2017 for the Ram 1500 model:\n\n* The Lone Star Silver Edition, available exclusively at Ram dealerships in [[Texas]] and based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, adds additional chrome trim pieces to the trim level. It debuted at the 2016 [[Texas State Fair]].\n* The Lone Star Yellow Rose Edition, also available exclusively at Ram dealerships in Texas and also based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, is available only in a model-exclusive Stinger Yellow Clear Coat exterior paint color. It debuted at the 2016 Texas State Fair.\n* The Night Edition, available at Ram dealerships nationwide, is based on the Sport trim level, and adds black-finished emblems, twenty-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, front grille, door handles, and emblems to the model.\n\nThere is also a new Off-Road Package available for all Ram 2500 models (aside from the Power Wagon trim level, which includes the package as standard equipment), and includes unique pickup bedside graphics, off-road suspension, front tow hooks, and the protection package.\n\nThe mid-level SLT trim level of the RAM 1500 is no longer available to retail customers, as it is now a lesser-equipped model reserved exclusively for fleet customers. However, the SLT trim level still remains for the Ram 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 models, and are still available to retail customers. However, retail customers wanting SLT features such as chrome front and rear bumpers and front grille, seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, power windows and door locks with keyless entry, the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, cloth seating surfaces, [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]], a rear-view backup camera system, and floor carpeting, can still opt for the Chrome Appearance and Popular Equipment Packages on the Tradesman model.\n\nFor customers wanting a less expensive [[Bluetooth]] option for the Ram truck, a new U Connect 3.0BT (RA2) radio is available for an additional $200.00, which includes an A/M-F/M radio and SiriusXM Satellite Radio tuner, Radio Data System (RDS), U Connect Bluetooth hands-free phone system with audio streaming and voice command, steering wheel-mounted remote voice command controls, a USB port and 3.5&nbsp;mm auxiliary audio input jack, and a three-inch (3.0\") monochrome LCD display screen. This radio option is available for the Tradesman trim level of all Ram trucks, and the Express trim level of the Ram 1500, and is included as part of a Popular Equipment Package on the latter model. Previously, customers wanting Bluetooth on a Ram Tradesman or Ram 1500 Express would have to upgrade to the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, which would add the same features as described above, as well as onscreen vehicle customization via the radio, and a full five-inch (5.0\") color touch-screen display, and cost an additional $495.00. In order to do this, the customer would also have to select the Popular Equipment Package on both models.\n\nThe RAM 2500 Power Wagon returned with a 6.4&nbsp;L [[HEMI]] gasoline V8 engine, a unique graphics package (delete option), black front grille, door handles, larger tires and black aluminum-alloy wheels, and the Off-Road Package. The Power Wagon Package is also available for the Ram 2500 Tradesman trim level, and also adds the 6.4L HEMI gasoline V8 engine.\n\n===2018 changes===\nChanges to the Ram for 2018 included the addition of [[HD Radio]] to all U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems, as well as a new [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] wireless hot-spot provided by [[AT&T Wireless]], an AT&T Wireless 4G LTE in-vehicle modem (both the AT&T Wireless 4G LTE modem and 4G LTE mobile hot-spot replace the [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] [[3G]] [[CDMA]] modem and 3G CDMA mobile hot-spot offered on previous Ram models), [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] smartphone integration for the U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems, and the SiriusXM Guardian service replacing the U Connect ACCESS service offered on previous RAM models for the U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems. In addition, all U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems get a new [[User Interface]] design for easier navigation of menus and applications.\n\nThe [[VM Motori]]-produced 3.0&nbsp;L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbodiesel engine returned in early 2018 for the RAM 1500, as it has been re-certified by the [[EPA]] after allegations of emissions cheating in 2017.\n\nMost upper trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Sport, Rebel, Laramie Longhorn, and Limited) get the new RAM front grille introduced for 2016, as well as a large 'RAM' emblem on the rear tailgate. Lower to mid trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Tradesman, Express, Big Horn, Lone Star, and Laramie) retain the standard RAM \"Cross-Hair\" front grille.\n\nThe Night Edition and Lone Star Silver Edition trim levels were continued.\n\nFor 2018, there are two new special editions:\n* The Harvest Edition (also available on the Ram 2500 and 3500), are based on the Big Horn and Lone Star models. Available in only four paint colors, two of which are unique to the Harvest Edition (Case IH Red, New Holland Blue, two-tone Black Clear Coat and Bright Silver Metallic, or Bright White Clear Coat). Aimed at farmers, the Harvest Edition adds features that are otherwise optional on the Big Horn and Lone Star, such as seventeen-inch chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels with all-terrain tires on 4X4 models, the U Connect 8.4 infotainment system with GPS navigation, [[SiriusXM]] Travel Link with five years of service included and one year of SiriusXM Guardian service, a trailer tow package with integrated trailer brake control, rear-mounted tow hitch, and trailer tow side mirrors. Also included are front bucket seats with power front driver's seat trimmed in premium cloth, chrome side steps, chrome side mirror covers, chrome door handles, and chrome front tow hooks. It is available as either a Quad Cab or a Crew Cab.\n* The Laramie Longhorn Southfork Edition Package, available on 1500, 2500, and 3500 Laramie Longhorn models, adds even more luxury features to the already luxurious truck, such as unique twenty-inch polished aluminum-alloy wheels, unique real wood interior trim, and a unique two-tone blue-and-beige interior color scheme.\n\n===2019 changes===\n\nFor 2019, the current fourth-generation Ram 1500 will be sold alongside its successor, the fifth-generation Ram 1500. Virtually identical to 2018 models, 2019 trucks will be given a new name, '''Ram 1500 Classic''', to distinguish them from their all-new fifth-generation successors. The Ram 1500 Classic will offer a 2-Door Regular Cab model, whereas the fifth-generation Ram 1500 will not. In addition, Quad and Crew Cab models are also expected to be offered.<ref name=\"allpar.com\"/>\n\nIn addition, the current-generation '''Ram 2500''', '''Ram 3500''', and '''Ram 3500/4500/5500 Chassis Cab''' models will be redesigned for the 2019 [[model year]].<ref>https://www.autoblog.com/2019/01/14/2019-ram-heavy-duty-revamp-1000-lb-ft-cummins/</ref>\n\n===Production===\nThe Ram 1500, Ram Mega Cab, Ram 2500/3500, DX Chassis Cab (Mexico Market), Ram 4500/5500 are assembled at FCA's Saltillo Assembly Plant in Coahuila, Mexico; the Ram 1500 (DT) is assembled at [[Sterling Heights Assembly]] (SHAP) in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Chrysler Group LLC Manufacturing Operations |url= http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?id=9117&mid=18}}</ref> The Ram 1500 (DS) was previously assembled at [[Warren Truck Assembly]] in [[Warren, Michigan]].\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Model\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n|-\n|rowspan=6|1500||2013\u20132018||{{convert|220|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler Pentastar engine|Pentastar]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||{{convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|269|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2009\u20132012||{{convert|226|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} '' 3.7 '' V6 ||{{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|235|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2009\u20132013||{{convert|287|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} '' 4.7 '' [[V8 engine|V8]]||{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2009\u20132012||rowspan=2|{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8 ||{{convert|390|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|407|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2013\u20132018||{{convert|395|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2014\u20132018||{{convert|182|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[List of VM Motori engines#A 630 DOHC|EcoDiesel]]'' V6 [[diesel engine|diesel]] ||{{convert|240|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|420|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|rowspan=12|2500/3500\n|2010\u20132018||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8 ||{{convert|383|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|400|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2014\u2013present||{{convert|392|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8||{{convert|410|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|429|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2010\u20132012||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Cummins B Series engine#ISB|Cummins]]'' diesel [[Straight-six engine|I6]] (6-Speed Manual/Automatic)||{{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|650|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2013\u20132018||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 (6-Speed Manual)||{{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|660|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2013\u20132018||rowspan=2|{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 (68RFE 6-Speed Automatic)||rowspan=2|{{convert|370|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|800|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2019||{{convert|850|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2011.5\u20132012||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} '' Cummins'' diesel I6 (High Output 6-Speed Automatic)||{{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|800|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2013\u20132014||rowspan=5|{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ([[Aisin]] ASC69RC Automatic)||rowspan=4|{{convert|385|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|850|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2015||{{convert|865|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2016\u20132017||{{convert|900|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2018||{{convert|930|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2019||{{convert|400|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|1000|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|rowspan=5|Chassis Cab\n|2010\u20132015<br/>(2010\u2013present in Mexico)||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8||{{convert|383|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|400|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2010\u20132012||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2013\u20132018||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 (6-Speed Manual)||{{convert|320|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|650|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2013\u20132018||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 (Aisin AS69RC Automatic)||{{convert|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|750|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n===Plug-in hybrid===\nA two-mode [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] version was planned to begin production in 2010, but Chrysler decided to cancel it in favor of a smaller test fleet of 140 [[plug-in hybrid]] (PHEV) Rams developed with support from a {{USD|48}} million grant from the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] financed through the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].

All 109 Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrids and 23 [[Chrysler Town & Country#Town & Country Plug-in hybrid|Chrysler Town & Country plug-in hybrid]]s deployed by the program were recalled due to damage sustained by three separate pickup trucks when their 12.9 [[kWh]] battery packs overheated. The carmaker plans to upgrade the battery packs with cells that use a different lithium-ion chemistry before the vehicles go back into service. Chrysler explained that no one was injured from any of the incidents, and the vehicles were not occupied at the time, nor any of the minivans were involved in any incident, but they were withdrawn as a precaution. The demonstration is a program jointly funded by Chrysler and the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] that includes the first-ever factory-produced vehicles capable of reverse power flow. The experimental system would allow fleet operators to use their plug-in hybrids to supply electricity for a building during a power outage, reduce power usage when electric rates are high or even sell electricity back to their utility company.<ref name=Chrysler>{{cite web|url= http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1079368_chrysler-yanks-plug-in-hybrid-test-fleet-off-roads-will-replace-batteries|title=Chrysler Yanks Plug-In Hybrid Test Fleet Off Roads, Will Replace Batteries|first=John |last=Voelcker |publisher=Green Car Reports |date=2012-09-24|accessdate=2012-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120924/AUTO0101/209240429 |title=Chrysler halts tests on plug-in hybrid fleet after batteries overheat |first=Bryce G. |last=Hoffman |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=2012-09-24 |accessdate=2012-09-30 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The company reported that the demonstration fleet had collectively accumulated 1.3 million miles (2.1 million km) before the vehicles were recalled.

The Kyushu Railway was nationalised on 1 July 1907.

There he meets an American bully and his arms dealing father, Lord Randolph Hellebore. While on Easter break, Bond's adventure continues in the Highlands of Scotland. Teaming up with Red Kelly, James finally reaches a castle and a [[loch]] and discovers a deadly secret.\n* ''[[Blood Fever]]'' (2006): In 1933, James Bond is back at Eton where he is now a member of a secret risk-taking club known as the Danger Society. When summer vacation arrives, Bond goes on a field trip to the Italian island of [[Sardinia]] where he stays with his much older cousin Victor. While there, James investigates a [[Rome|Roman]] secret society known as the Millenaria that has planned throughout history to restore the Roman Empire.

With corrupt cops and hired assassins hot on his heels, Bond must travel through Havana and brave Caribbean waters to stop a countdown to mass murder.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thebookbond.com/2016/03/young-bond-goes-to-cuba-in-heads-you-die.html | title=Young Bond goes to Cuba in HEADS YOU DIE | date=22 March 2016}}</ref>\n* ''Strike Lightning'' (2016): Set at the end of 1934, while Bond is at [[Fettes College]] in Scotland, his father's school. When James stumbles upon a horrific sight, he knows things are not what they seem. His school is determined to make him believe what happened was an accident, but James believes what he saw was murder. The significance of the events at school only come to light in the course of an adventure that takes James across Europe and puts him within range of a warmongering villain. Has James got what it takes to triumph over this man, the worst kind of enemy, who boasts a new kind of weapon?\n* ''Red Nemesis'' (2017): James is on home soil when he receives a package with a message from beyond the grave. The package's mysterious contents put James at the heart of a long-running plot that, if it runs its course, will paint London's streets red with blood. Not only will James have to fight to stay alive and save the country he loves, but to clear the Bond family name, which he holds so dear. The stakes couldn't be higher, and James doesn't know who he can trust . . .\n\n==History==\n===Pre-release criticism===\nPrior to the release of ''SilverFin'', the idea of a Young Bond series had not gone over too well with the fans of the more traditional Bond literature and had come under heavy fire, with some fans comparing it to an unsuccessful 1960s attempt by Bond's publishers to launch a youth-oriented line of fiction that resulted in only one book: ''[[The Adventures of James Bond Junior 003\u00bd]]'' written by the [[pseudonym]]ous R. D. Mascott. There was also a moderately successful ''[[James Bond Jr.]]'' television series in the early 1990s aimed at children that dealt with Bond's supposed nephew.\n\n[[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], who had written fourteen original novels and two novelisations featuring the adult Bond, was also critical of the series prior to the release of the first book. He stated:\n\n<blockquote>''It's just the last desperate attempt to draw in a new audience. The films have little to do with the Bond we used to know, and now the books are going the same way.''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.scotsman.com/features.cfm?id=221082005 | title = John Gardner on Young Bond series | work = Boys' own James Bond | accessdate =28 February 2005}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHigson, for his part, has been on record as stating that he intends to stay true to the backstory Ian Fleming created for Bond, though this in many ways contradicts the popular ''[[James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007]]'' by [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]].\n\n===Post-release reaction===\nWhen ''SilverFin'' was published in March 2005, reviews of the novel were good.

Not only will James have to fight to stay alive and save the country he loves, but to clear the Bond family name, which he holds so dear. The stakes couldn't be higher, and James doesn't know who he can trust . . .\n\n==History==\n===Pre-release criticism===\nPrior to the release of ''SilverFin'', the idea of a Young Bond series had not gone over too well with the fans of the more traditional Bond literature and had come under heavy fire, with some fans comparing it to an unsuccessful 1960s attempt by Bond's publishers to launch a youth-oriented line of fiction that resulted in only one book: ''[[The Adventures of James Bond Junior 003\u00bd]]'' written by the [[pseudonym]]ous R. D. Mascott. There was also a moderately successful ''[[James Bond Jr.]]'' television series in the early 1990s aimed at children that dealt with Bond's supposed nephew.\n\n[[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], who had written fourteen original novels and two novelisations featuring the adult Bond, was also critical of the series prior to the release of the first book. He stated:\n\n<blockquote>''It's just the last desperate attempt to draw in a new audience. The films have little to do with the Bond we used to know, and now the books are going the same way.''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.scotsman.com/features.cfm?id=221082005 | title = John Gardner on Young Bond series | work = Boys' own James Bond | accessdate =28 February 2005}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHigson, for his part, has been on record as stating that he intends to stay true to the backstory Ian Fleming created for Bond, though this in many ways contradicts the popular ''[[James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007]]'' by [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]].\n\n===Post-release reaction===\nWhen ''SilverFin'' was published in March 2005, reviews of the novel were good.
