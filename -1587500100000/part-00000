Having worked previously with lead writer and executive producer [[Russell T Davies]], Wilton was keen to involve herself with his 2005 revival of ''Doctor Who'' after he sought to cast her. Jones is introduced in the two-part story \"[[Aliens of London]]\" and \"[[World War Three (Doctor Who)|World War Three]]\" as a [[Member of Parliament]] who aids the [[Ninth Doctor]] against an alien invasion of London. The episode introduces a running joke associated with the character which would see her frequently introduce herself by holding up her ID and stating her name and rank; in subsequent episodes this was usually met with the response \"Yes, I/we know who you are,\" even occurring with [[Dalek|the Daleks]] and the Sycorax.\n\nWilton returned for the series' [[The Christmas Invasion|2005 Christmas special]] as Davies wanted to include a familiar character whose presence would ease the transition following [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|a change in the series' lead actor]]. Despite her character having been introduced as fair-minded and hard-working, Harriet is depicted as an uncompromising [[Prime Minister]], which led to comparisons to real-life politicians. Response to the character's political decisions prompted mixed commentary from the media; some reviewers felt that the character had acted unreasonably whilst others sympathised with her actions and felt her scripted political demise was unjust.\n\nWilton's last appearance in 2008 coincided with producer [[Phil Collinson]]'s final episodes; she was keen to make a final return as she had been there for Collinson's first episodes as producer. Harriet is killed off in [[The Stolen Earth|the penultimate episode]] of the show's [[Doctor Who (series 4)|fourth series]] in which she sacrifices her own life to help prevent a [[Dalek]] takeover of Earth. Harriet's final scenes were designed to complete a tripartite story arc and to give the character redemption.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Series 1===\nHarriet Jones is introduced in the 2005 episode \"[[Aliens of London]]\" as an MP for the fictional constituency of Flydale North.
