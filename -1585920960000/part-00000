If the interest is credited once, at the end of the year, the value of the account at year-end will be $2.00.

Compounding quarterly yields {{nowrap|1=$1.00 \u00d7 1.25<sup>4</sup> = $2.4414\u2026}}, and compounding monthly yields {{nowrap|1=$1.00 \u00d7 (1 + 1/12)<sup>12</sup> = $2.613035\u2026}} If there are {{math|''n''}} compounding intervals, the interest for each interval will be {{math|100%/''n''}} and the value at the end of the year will be $1.00\u00d7{{math|1=(1 + 1/''n'')<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nBernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit (the [[force of interest]]) with larger {{math|''n''}} and, thus, smaller compounding intervals. Compounding weekly ({{math|1=''n'' = 52}}) yields $2.692597..., while compounding daily ({{math|1=''n'' = 365}}) yields $2.714567..., just two cents more. The limit as {{math|''n''}} grows large is the number that came to be known as {{mvar|e}}; with ''continuous'' compounding, the account value will reach $2.7182818...\n\nMore generally, an account that starts at $1 and offers an annual interest rate of {{math|''R''}} will, after {{math|''t''}} years, yield {{math|''e''<sup>''Rt''</sup>}} dollars with continuous compounding. (Here {{math|''R''}} is the decimal equivalent of the rate of interest expressed as a percentage, so for 5% interest, {{math|1=''R'' = 5/100 = 0.05}}.)\n\n===Bernoulli trials===\n[[File:Bernoulli trial sequence.svg|thumb|300px|Graphs of probability ''P'' of {{em|not}} observing independent events each of probability 1/''n'' after ''n'' Bernoulli trials, and 1 \u2212 ''P''&thinsp; vs ''n''&thinsp;; it can be observed that as ''n'' increases, the probability of a 1/''n''-chance event never appearing after ''n'' tries rapidly {{nowrap|converges to 1/''e''.}}]]\nThe number {{mvar|e}} itself also has applications to [[probability theory]], where it arises in a way not obviously related to exponential growth. Suppose that a gambler plays a slot machine that pays out with a probability of one in {{math|''n''}} and plays it {{math|''n''}} times. Then, for large {{math|''n''}} (such as a million) the probability that the gambler will lose every bet is approximately {{math|1/''e''}}. For {{math|1=''n'' = 20}} it is already approximately 1/2.79.\n\nThis is an example of a [[Bernoulli trial]] process. Each time the gambler plays the slots, there is a one in one million chance of winning. Playing one million times is modelled by the [[binomial distribution]], which is closely related to the [[binomial theorem]] and [[Pascal's triangle]]. The probability of winning {{math|''k''}} times out of a million trials is:\n:<math>\\binom{10^6}{k} \\left(10^{-6}\\right)^k\\left(1 - 10^{-6}\\right)^{10^6-k}.</math>\n\nIn particular, the probability of winning zero times ({{math|1=''k'' = 0}}) is\n:<math>\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{10^6}\\right)^{10^6}.</math>\n\nThis is very close to the limit\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n = \\frac{1}{e}.</math>\n\n===Standard normal distribution===\n{{main|Normal distribution}}\n\nThe normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation is known as the ''standard normal distribution'', given by the [[probability density function]]\n:<math>\\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} x^2}.</math>\n\nThe constraint of unit variance (and thus also unit standard deviation) results in the {{frac2|1|2}} in the exponent, and the constraint of unit total area under the curve {{math|''\u03d5''(''x'')}} results in the factor <math>\\textstyle 1/\\sqrt{2\\pi}</math>.<sup>[[Gaussian integral|[proof]]]</sup>  This function is symmetric around {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}, where it attains its maximum value <math>\\textstyle 1/\\sqrt{2\\pi}</math>, and has [[inflection point]]s at {{math|1=''x'' = \u00b11}}.\n\n===Derangements===\n{{main|Derangement}}\nAnother application of {{mvar|e}}, also discovered in part by Jacob Bernoulli along with [[Pierre Raymond de Montmort]], is in the problem of [[derangement]]s, also known as the ''hat check problem'':<ref>Grinstead, C.M. and Snell, J.L.''[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html Introduction to probability theory]'' (published online under the [[GFDL]]), p.&nbsp;85.</ref> {{math|''n''}} guests are invited to a party, and at the door, the guests all check their hats with the butler, who in turn places the hats into {{math|''n''}} boxes, each labelled with the name of one guest. But the butler has not asked the identities of the guests, and so he puts the hats into boxes selected at random. The problem of de Montmort is to find the probability that ''none'' of the hats gets put into the right box. The answer is:\n\n:<math>p_n = 1 - \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!} - \\frac{1}{3!} + \\cdots + \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!} = \\sum_{k = 0}^n \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}.</math>\n\nAs the number {{math|''n''}} of guests tends to infinity, {{math|''p''<sub>''n''</sub>}} approaches {{math|1/''e''}}.

An example is [[Stirling's formula]] for the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotics]] of the [[factorial function]], in which both the numbers {{mvar|e}} and [[pi|{{pi}}]] enter:\n:<math>n! \\sim \\sqrt{2\\pi n} \\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n.</math>\n\nAs a consequence,\n:<math>e = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{n}{\\sqrt[n]{n!}} .</math>\n\n==In calculus==\n\n[[Image:Exp derivative at 0.svg|thumb|right|The graphs of the functions {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''a''{{sup|''x''}}}} are shown for {{math|1=''a'' = 2}} (dotted), {{math|1=''a'' = ''e''}} (blue), and {{math|1=''a'' = 4}} (dashed).

(1998) ''Calculus: An intuitive and physical approach'', section 12.3 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YdjK_rD7BEkC&pg=PA337 \"The Derived Functions of Logarithmic Functions.\"], pp. 337 ff, Courier Dover Publications, 1998, {{isbn|0-486-40453-6}}</ref> A general exponential {{nowrap|function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''a''<sup>''x''</sup>}}}} has a derivative, given by a [[limit of a function|limit]]:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{d}{dx}a^x\n    &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^{x+h} - a^x}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^x a^h - a^x}{h} \\\\\n    &= a^x \\cdot \\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^h - 1}{h}\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe parenthesized limit on the right is independent of the {{nowrap|variable {{math|''x''}}:}} it depends only on the {{nowrap|base {{math|''a''}}.}} When the base is set {{nowrap|to {{mvar|e}},}} this limit is equal {{nowrap|to {{math|1}},}} and so {{mvar|e}} is symbolically defined by the equation:\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x.</math>\n\nConsequently, the exponential function with base {{mvar|e}} is particularly suited to doing calculus. {{nowrap|Choosing {{mvar|e}},}} as opposed to some other number, as the base of the exponential function makes calculations involving the derivative much simpler.\n\nAnother motivation comes from considering the derivative of the base-{{math|''a''}} logarithm,<ref>This is the approach taken by Kline (1998).</ref> i.e., of {{math|log<sub>''a''</sub> ''x''}} for&nbsp;{{math|x > 0}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{d}{dx}\\log_a x\n    &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\log_a(x + h) - \\log_a(x)}{h} \\\\\n    &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\log_a(1 + h/x)}{x\\cdot h/x} \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{x}\\log_a\\left(\\lim_{u\\to 0}(1 + u)^\\frac{1}{u}\\right) \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{x}\\log_a e,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the substitution {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''h''/''x''}} was made. The {{mvar|a}}-logarithm of {{mvar|e}} is 1, if {{mvar|a}} equals {{mvar|e}}. So symbolically,\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx}\\log_e x = \\frac{1}{x}.</math>\n\nThe logarithm with this special base is called the [[natural logarithm]] and is denoted as {{math|ln}}; it behaves well under differentiation since there is no undetermined limit to carry through the calculations.\n\nThere are thus two ways in which to select such special numbers {{mvar|a}}. One way is to set the derivative of the exponential function {{math|''a''<sup>''x''</sup>}} equal to {{math|''a''<sup>''x''</sup>}}, and solve for {{math|''a''}}. The other way is to set the derivative of the base {{math|''a''}} logarithm to {{math|1/''x''}} and solve for {{math|''a''}}. In each case, one arrives at a convenient choice of base for doing calculus. It turns out that these two solutions for {{mvar|a}} are actually ''the same'', the number {{mvar|e}}.\n\n===Alternative characterizations===\n[[File:Part38figure02.gif|thumb|right|The five colored regions are of equal area, and define units of [[hyperbolic angle]] along the {{nowrap|[[hyperbola]] <math>xy=1.</math>}}]]\n{{See also|#Representations|Characterizations of the exponential function}}\n\nOther characterizations of {{mvar|e}} are also possible: one is as the [[limit of a sequence]], another is as the sum of an infinite series, and still others rely on [[integral calculus]].

It was the first number to be proved transcendental without having been specifically constructed for this purpose (compare with [[Liouville number]]); the proof was given by [[Charles Hermite]] in 1873.\n\nIt is conjectured that {{mvar|e}} is [[normal number|normal]], meaning that when {{math|''e''}} is expressed in any [[Radix|base]] the possible digits in that base are uniformly distributed (occur with equal probability in any sequence of given length).\n\n===Complex numbers===\nThe [[exponential function]] {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} may be written as a [[Taylor series]]\n\n:<math> e^{x} = 1 + {x \\over 1!} + {x^{2} \\over 2!} + {x^{3} \\over 3!} + \\cdots = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\n\nBecause this series is [[convergent series|convergent]] for every [[complex number|complex]] value of {{mvar|x}}, it is commonly used to extend the definition of {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} to the complex numbers.

If the interest is credited once, at the end of the year, the value of the account at year-end will be $2.00. What happens if the interest is computed and credited more frequently during the year?}}\n\nIf the interest is credited twice in the year, the interest rate for each 6 months will be 50%, so the initial $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding {{nowrap|1=$1.00 \u00d7 1.5<sup>2</sup> = $2.25}} at the end of the year. Compounding quarterly yields {{nowrap|1=$1.00 \u00d7 1.25<sup>4</sup> = $2.4414\u2026}}, and compounding monthly yields {{nowrap|1=$1.00 \u00d7 (1 + 1/12)<sup>12</sup> = $2.613035\u2026}} If there are {{math|''n''}} compounding intervals, the interest for each interval will be {{math|100%/''n''}} and the value at the end of the year will be $1.00\u00d7{{math|1=(1 + 1/''n'')<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nBernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit (the [[force of interest]]) with larger {{math|''n''}} and, thus, smaller compounding intervals. Compounding weekly ({{math|1=''n'' = 52}}) yields $2.692597..., while compounding daily ({{math|1=''n'' = 365}}) yields $2.714567..., just two cents more. The limit as {{math|''n''}} grows large is the number that came to be known as {{mvar|e}}; with ''continuous'' compounding, the account value will reach $2.7182818...\n\nMore generally, an account that starts at $1 and offers an annual interest rate of {{math|''R''}} will, after {{math|''t''}} years, yield {{math|''e''<sup>''Rt''</sup>}} dollars with continuous compounding. (Here {{math|''R''}} is the decimal equivalent of the rate of interest expressed as a percentage, so for 5% interest, {{math|1=''R'' = 5/100 = 0.05}}.)\n\n===Bernoulli trials===\n[[File:Bernoulli trial sequence.svg|thumb|300px|Graphs of probability ''P'' of {{em|not}} observing independent events each of probability 1/''n'' after ''n'' Bernoulli trials, and 1 \u2212 ''P''&thinsp; vs ''n''&thinsp;; it can be observed that as ''n'' increases, the probability of a 1/''n''-chance event never appearing after ''n'' tries rapidly {{nowrap|converges to 1/''e''.}}]]\nThe number {{mvar|e}} itself also has applications to [[probability theory]], where it arises in a way not obviously related to exponential growth. Suppose that a gambler plays a slot machine that pays out with a probability of one in {{math|''n''}} and plays it {{math|''n''}} times. Then, for large {{math|''n''}} (such as a million) the probability that the gambler will lose every bet is approximately {{math|1/''e''}}. For {{math|1=''n'' = 20}} it is already approximately 1/2.79.\n\nThis is an example of a [[Bernoulli trial]] process. Each time the gambler plays the slots, there is a one in one million chance of winning. Playing one million times is modelled by the [[binomial distribution]], which is closely related to the [[binomial theorem]] and [[Pascal's triangle]]. The probability of winning {{math|''k''}} times out of a million trials is:\n:<math>\\binom{10^6}{k} \\left(10^{-6}\\right)^k\\left(1 - 10^{-6}\\right)^{10^6-k}.</math>\n\nIn particular, the probability of winning zero times ({{math|1=''k'' = 0}}) is\n:<math>\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{10^6}\\right)^{10^6}.</math>\n\nThis is very close to the limit\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n = \\frac{1}{e}.</math>\n\n===Standard normal distribution===\n{{main|Normal distribution}}\n\nThe normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation is known as the ''standard normal distribution'', given by the [[probability density function]]\n:<math>\\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} x^2}.</math>\n\nThe constraint of unit variance (and thus also unit standard deviation) results in the {{frac2|1|2}} in the exponent, and the constraint of unit total area under the curve {{math|''\u03d5''(''x'')}} results in the factor <math>\\textstyle 1/\\sqrt{2\\pi}</math>.<sup>[[Gaussian integral|[proof]]]</sup>  This function is symmetric around {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}, where it attains its maximum value <math>\\textstyle 1/\\sqrt{2\\pi}</math>, and has [[inflection point]]s at {{math|1=''x'' = \u00b11}}.\n\n===Derangements===\n{{main|Derangement}}\nAnother application of {{mvar|e}}, also discovered in part by Jacob Bernoulli along with [[Pierre Raymond de Montmort]], is in the problem of [[derangement]]s, also known as the ''hat check problem'':<ref>Grinstead, C.M. and Snell, J.L.''[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html Introduction to probability theory]'' (published online under the [[GFDL]]), p.&nbsp;85.</ref> {{math|''n''}} guests are invited to a party, and at the door, the guests all check their hats with the butler, who in turn places the hats into {{math|''n''}} boxes, each labelled with the name of one guest. But the butler has not asked the identities of the guests, and so he puts the hats into boxes selected at random. The problem of de Montmort is to find the probability that ''none'' of the hats gets put into the right box. The answer is:\n\n:<math>p_n = 1 - \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!} - \\frac{1}{3!} + \\cdots + \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!} = \\sum_{k = 0}^n \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}.</math>\n\nAs the number {{math|''n''}} of guests tends to infinity, {{math|''p''<sub>''n''</sub>}} approaches {{math|1/''e''}}. Furthermore, the number of ways the hats can be placed into the boxes so that none of the hats are in the right box is {{math|''n''!/''e''}} rounded to the nearest integer, for every positive&nbsp;{{math|''n''}}.<ref>Knuth (1997) ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'' Volume I, Addison-Wesley, p.&nbsp;183 {{isbn|0-201-03801-3}}.</ref>\n\n===Optimal planning problems===\nA stick of length {{mvar|L}} is broken into {{mvar|n}} equal parts.

The quantity <math>x^{-1}\\ln x</math> is a measure of [[Shannon information|information]] gleaned from an event occurring with probability <math>1/x</math>, so that essentially the same optimal division appears in optimal planning problems like the [[secretary problem]].\n\n===Asymptotics===\nThe number {{mvar|e}} occurs naturally in connection with many problems involving [[asymptotics]]. An example is [[Stirling's formula]] for the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotics]] of the [[factorial function]], in which both the numbers {{mvar|e}} and [[pi|{{pi}}]] enter:\n:<math>n! \\sim \\sqrt{2\\pi n} \\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n.</math>\n\nAs a consequence,\n:<math>e = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{n}{\\sqrt[n]{n!}} .</math>\n\n==In calculus==\n\n[[Image:Exp derivative at 0.svg|thumb|right|The graphs of the functions {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''a''{{sup|''x''}}}} are shown for {{math|1=''a'' = 2}} (dotted), {{math|1=''a'' = ''e''}} (blue), and {{math|1=''a'' = 4}} (dashed).

(1998) ''Calculus: An intuitive and physical approach'', section 12.3 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YdjK_rD7BEkC&pg=PA337 \"The Derived Functions of Logarithmic Functions.\"], pp. 337 ff, Courier Dover Publications, 1998, {{isbn|0-486-40453-6}}</ref> A general exponential {{nowrap|function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''a''<sup>''x''</sup>}}}} has a derivative, given by a [[limit of a function|limit]]:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{d}{dx}a^x\n    &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^{x+h} - a^x}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^x a^h - a^x}{h} \\\\\n    &= a^x \\cdot \\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^h - 1}{h}\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe parenthesized limit on the right is independent of the {{nowrap|variable {{math|''x''}}:}} it depends only on the {{nowrap|base {{math|''a''}}.}} When the base is set {{nowrap|to {{mvar|e}},}} this limit is equal {{nowrap|to {{math|1}},}} and so {{mvar|e}} is symbolically defined by the equation:\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x.</math>\n\nConsequently, the exponential function with base {{mvar|e}} is particularly suited to doing calculus. {{nowrap|Choosing {{mvar|e}},}} as opposed to some other number, as the base of the exponential function makes calculations involving the derivative much simpler.\n\nAnother motivation comes from considering the derivative of the base-{{math|''a''}} logarithm,<ref>This is the approach taken by Kline (1998).</ref> i.e., of {{math|log<sub>''a''</sub> ''x''}} for&nbsp;{{math|x > 0}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{d}{dx}\\log_a x\n    &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\log_a(x + h) - \\log_a(x)}{h} \\\\\n    &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\log_a(1 + h/x)}{x\\cdot h/x} \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{x}\\log_a\\left(\\lim_{u\\to 0}(1 + u)^\\frac{1}{u}\\right) \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{x}\\log_a e,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the substitution {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''h''/''x''}} was made. The {{mvar|a}}-logarithm of {{mvar|e}} is 1, if {{mvar|a}} equals {{mvar|e}}. So symbolically,\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx}\\log_e x = \\frac{1}{x}.</math>\n\nThe logarithm with this special base is called the [[natural logarithm]] and is denoted as {{math|ln}}; it behaves well under differentiation since there is no undetermined limit to carry through the calculations.\n\nThere are thus two ways in which to select such special numbers {{mvar|a}}. One way is to set the derivative of the exponential function {{math|''a''<sup>''x''</sup>}} equal to {{math|''a''<sup>''x''</sup>}}, and solve for {{math|''a''}}. The other way is to set the derivative of the base {{math|''a''}} logarithm to {{math|1/''x''}} and solve for {{math|''a''}}. In each case, one arrives at a convenient choice of base for doing calculus. It turns out that these two solutions for {{mvar|a}} are actually ''the same'', the number {{mvar|e}}.\n\n===Alternative characterizations===\n[[File:Part38figure02.gif|thumb|right|The five colored regions are of equal area, and define units of [[hyperbolic angle]] along the {{nowrap|[[hyperbola]] <math>xy=1.</math>}}]]\n{{See also|#Representations|Characterizations of the exponential function}}\n\nOther characterizations of {{mvar|e}} are also possible: one is as the [[limit of a sequence]], another is as the sum of an infinite series, and still others rely on [[integral calculus]]. So far, the following two (equivalent) properties have been introduced:\n\n# The number {{mvar|e}} is the unique positive [[real number]] such that <math>\\frac{d}{dt}e^t = e^t</math>.\n# The number {{mvar|e}} is the unique positive real number such that <math>\\frac{d}{dt} \\log_e t = \\frac{1}{t}</math>.\n\nThe following four characterizations can be [[characterizations of the exponential function#Equivalence of the characterizations|proven equivalent]]:\n\n{{ordered list\n | start=3\n | The number {{mvar|e}} is the [[limit of a sequence|limit]]\n:<math>e = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{n} \\right)^n</math>\n\nSimilarly:\n:<math>e = \\lim_{t\\to 0} \\left( 1 + t \\right)^{\\frac{1}{t}}</math>\n | The number {{mvar|e}} is the sum of the [[infinite series]]\n: <math>e = \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n!} = \\frac{1}{0!} + \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!} + \\frac{1}{3!} + \\frac{1}{4!} + \\cdots ,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''n''!}} is the [[factorial]] of {{math|''n''}}.

It was the first number to be proved transcendental without having been specifically constructed for this purpose (compare with [[Liouville number]]); the proof was given by [[Charles Hermite]] in 1873.\n\nIt is conjectured that {{mvar|e}} is [[normal number|normal]], meaning that when {{math|''e''}} is expressed in any [[Radix|base]] the possible digits in that base are uniformly distributed (occur with equal probability in any sequence of given length).\n\n===Complex numbers===\nThe [[exponential function]] {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} may be written as a [[Taylor series]]\n\n:<math> e^{x} = 1 + {x \\over 1!} + {x^{2} \\over 2!} + {x^{3} \\over 3!} + \\cdots = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\n\nBecause this series is [[convergent series|convergent]] for every [[complex number|complex]] value of {{mvar|x}}, it is commonly used to extend the definition of {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} to the complex numbers. This, with the Taylor series for [[trigonometric functions|{{math|sin}} and {{math|cos ''x''}}]], allows one to derive [[Euler's formula]]:\n\n:<math>e^{ix} = \\cos x + i\\sin x ,</math>\n\nwhich holds for every complex {{math|''x''}}. The special case with {{math|''x'' {{=}} [[pi|\u03c0]]}} is [[Euler's identity]]:\n\n:<math>e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0 ,</math>\n\nfrom which it follows that, in the [[principal branch]] of the logarithm,\n\n:<math>\\ln (-1) = i\\pi .</math>\n\nFurthermore, using the laws for exponentiation,\n\n:<math>(\\cos x + i\\sin x)^n = \\left(e^{ix}\\right)^n = e^{inx} = \\cos (nx) + i \\sin (nx) ,</math>\n\nwhich is [[de Moivre's formula]].\n\nThe expression\n\n:<math>\\cos x + i \\sin x</math>\n\nis sometimes referred to as {{math|cis(''x'')}}.\n\nThe expressions of <math>\\sin x</math> and <math>\\cos x</math> in terms of the [[exponential function]] can be deduced:\n\n:<math>\n  \\sin x = \\frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i} , \\qquad\n  \\cos x = \\frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}.\n</math>\n\n===Differential equations===\nThe family of functions\n\n:<math>y(x) = Ce^x,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|C}} is any real number, is the solution to the [[differential equation]]\n\n:<math>y' = y .</math>\n\n==Representations==\n{{Main|List of representations of e|l1=List of representations of {{mvar|e}}}}\n\nThe number {{mvar|e}} can be represented as a [[real number]] in a variety of ways: as an [[infinite series]], an [[infinite product]], a [[continued fraction]], or a [[limit of a sequence]]. The chief among these representations, particularly in introductory [[calculus]] courses is the limit\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n,</math>\n\ngiven above, as well as the series\n:<math>e=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n!}</math>\n\ngiven by evaluating the above [[power series]] for {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}}.\n\nLess common is the [[continued fraction]]\n<!--move to history section or say <ref>[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] was the first showed that {{mvar|e}} can be represented as a continued fraction.</ref>-->\n\n:<math>\n  e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, ..., 1, 2n, 1, ...],\n</math><ref>Hofstadter, D.R., \"Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought\" Basic Books (1995) {{isbn|0-7139-9155-0}}</ref><ref>{{OEIS|id=A003417}}</ref>\n\nwhich written out looks like\n\n:<math>e = 2 +\n\\cfrac{1}\n   {1 + \\cfrac{1}\n      {2 + \\cfrac{1}\n         {1 + \\cfrac{1}\n            {1 + \\cfrac{1}\n               {4 + \\cfrac{1}\n            {1 + \\cfrac{1}\n               {1 + \\ddots}\n                  }\n               }\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   }\n.\n</math>\n\nThis continued fraction for {{mvar|e}} converges three times as quickly:{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n:<math> e = 1 + \\cfrac{2}{1 + \\cfrac{1}{6 + \\cfrac{1}{10 + \\cfrac{1}{14 + \\cfrac{1}{18 + \\cfrac{1}{22 + \\cfrac{1}{26 + \\ddots}}}}}}}.</math>\n\nMany other series, sequence, continued fraction, and infinite product representations of {{mvar|e}} have been developed.\n\n===Stochastic representations===\nIn addition to exact analytical expressions for representation of {{mvar|e}}, there are stochastic techniques for estimating {{mvar|e}}.  One such approach begins with an infinite sequence of independent random variables {{math|''X''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''X''<sub>2</sub>}}..., drawn from the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] on [0, 1]. Let {{math|''V''}} be the least number {{math|''n''}} such that the sum of the first {{math|''n''}} observations exceeds 1:\n\n:<math>V = \\min\\left\\{ n \\mid X_1 + X_2 + \\cdots + X_n > 1 \\right\\}.</math>\n\nThen the [[expected value]] of {{math|''V''}} is {{mvar|e}}: {{math|E(''V'') {{=}} ''e''}}.<ref>Russell, K.G.

From his father he assumed the leadership of the nobility in the [[War of the Lombards]], fought against the agents of the [[Emperor Frederick II]]. \n\nHe was a warrior from an early age. At the [[Battle of Agridi]] in 1232, though he was supposed to be in the rearguard with his father and the [[King of Cyprus]], he instead went to the front, beside either [[Hugh of Ibelin (died 1238)|Hugh of Ibelin]] and [[Anceau of Brie]], commanders of the first and second [[Battle (formation)|battles]].

Initially, they were composed of men and women who had escaped into the mountains to avoid [[conscription]] into [[Vichy France]]'s  ''[[Service du travail obligatoire]]'' (\"Compulsory Work Service\" or ''STO'') to provide [[forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor for Germany]]. To avert capture and deportation to Germany, they became increasingly organized into active resistance groups.\n\n==Meaning==\nOriginally the word came from the kind of terrain in which the armed resistance groups hid, high ground in southeastern France covered with scrub growth called ''[[Maquis shrubland|maquis]]'' (shrubland).<ref name=\"Definition of maquis\">{{cite web| url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/maquis/| title=Definition of maquis| author=Online Etymology Dictionary| accessdate=2007-12-14}} from Dictionary.com website</ref> \n\nAlthough strictly speaking it means [[thicket]], ''maquis'' could be roughly translated as \"[[the bush]]\".<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Maquis Freedictionary definition: References in classic literature]</ref> Historians have not established how this [[Corsica]]n term arrived on the mainland of France.\n\n{{block quote|In Corsica, the saying ''Prendre le maquis'' 'to go into the bush' is used to describe someone who leaves the village in order to live in the bush, biding time to seek revenge, or are being pursued by people with and intent to arrest or kill.\n\nThe Italian-derived word \"''maquis''\" is commonly used to describe woods and scrubland on the island, and evokes an all-encompassing image of woods and mountains, whereas the more limited word \"''garrigue''\" used in the south of France indicated [...] an inhospitable terrain, and the words \"''bois''\" ('wood'), \"''foret''\" ('forest') and \"''montagne''\" ('mountain') were too bland.<ref name=\"R.

Their image was a committed and voluntary fighter, a ''combattant'', as opposed to the previous ''r\u00e9fractaire'' (\"unmanageable\").<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The term became an honorific meaning \"armed resistance fighter\". The maquis came to symbolize the French Resistance. The title Maquis is a very broad term that was used to describe a wide variety of different resistance groups throughout France. The Term Maquis describes resistance groups that fought in France before the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944. Once the Allies had secured a foothold in France the government of Free France attempted to unite the separate groups of Maquis under the banner of the [[French Forces of the Interior|FFI.]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=J3QJdqgisgMC&oi=fnd&pg=PP11&dq=maquis+Second+world+war&ots=WxVVh0mUlO&sig=zcYUvayLt_Jdw_DUQzOLVgK_KbM#v=onepage&q=maquis%20Second%20world%20war&f=false|title=France and the Second World War: Occupation, Collaboration and Resistance|last=Davies|first=Peter|date=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|year=|isbn=9780415238960|location=|pages=8|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Operations==\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumbnail|240px|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] d\u00e9partement in August 1944. Third and fourth from the right are two SOE officers. Second from right is probably [[Christine Granville]].]]\nMost maquisards operated in the remote or mountainous areas of [[Brittany]] and southern France, especially in the [[Alps]] and in [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]]. They relied on [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] to harass the [[Milice]] and German occupation troops. The Maquis also aided the escape of downed [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] airmen, [[Jews]] and others pursued by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] and German authorities. Maquisards usually relied on some degree of sympathy or cooperation from the local populace. In March 1944, the German army began a terror campaign throughout France.{{cn|date=July 2018}} This included reprisals against civilians living in areas where the French resistance was active, such as the [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|Oradour-sur-Glane]], [[Maill\u00e9 massacre|Maill\u00e9]] and [[Tulle massacre|Tulle]] massacres by SS troops. The Maquisards were later to take their revenge in the ''[[\u00e9puration sauvage]]'' that took place after the war's end.<ref name=\"\u00e9puration sauvage\">{{harvnb|Jackson|2003|p=577}}</ref>\n\nMost of the Maquis cells\u2014like the [[Maquis du Limousin]] or the [[Maquis du Vercors]]\u2014took names after the area they were operating in. The size of these cells varied from tens to thousands of men and women.\n\nIn [[French Indochina]], the local resistance fighting the Japanese since 1941 was backed up by a special forces airborne commando unit created by de Gaulle in 1943, and known as the [[Corps L\u00e9ger d'Intervention]] (CLI). They were supplied by airlifts of the British [[Force 136]].\n\n==Politics==\nPolitically, the Maquis were very diverse, including [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Communism|communists]], and [[Anarchism|anarchists]]. Some Maquis bands that operated in southwest France were composed entirely of [[Spanish Maquis|left-wing Spanish veterans]] of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Spanish Civil War veteran [[Carlos Romero Gim\u00e9nez]] was a center-democratic liberal operating from [[Bordeaux]].\n\nWhen Germany began a forced labor draft (''[[Service du travail obligatoire]], STO'') in France at the beginning of 1943, thousands of young men fled and joined the Maquis. The British [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) helped the Maquis with supplies and agents. The American [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) also began to send its own agents to France in cooperation with the SOE and the French [[Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action|BCRA]] agents, as part of [[Operation Jedburgh]]. The British government provided supplies and support to assist [[Charles de Gaulle]] to unify the [[Free French]] resistance movement.\n\nThe Maquis were a fractured organization that had many different sub groups with their own objectives and political affiliations. In 1944 an [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] agent by the name of \u00a0Robert R. Kehoe was embedded within a group of Maquis and described the organization as \u201cFractured.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol42no5/html/v42i5a03p.htm|title=1944: An Allied Team with the French Resistance \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> Also saying \u201cthe various components were quite independent, with members loyal to their own leaders and to the political forces behind them\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol42no5/html/v42i5a03p.htm|title=1944: An Allied Team with the French Resistance \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> Examples of the independence of separate Maquis groups can be found all throughout France during the Second World War.

In northern and western France, movements like ''Organisation Civile et Militaire'', ''Lib\u00e9ration-Nord'', ''Ceux de la Lib\u00e9ration'', ''Ceux de la R\u00e9sistance'' survived through clandestine pamphlets or newspapers, to build up a solidarity of attitudes and disparate actions and to taunt the Germans (''narguer les Allemands'').<ref name=\"H.R.

Kedward :Resistance, in ''Occupied France: Collaboration and Resistance 1940\u20131944'' (New York: Basil Blackwell Ltd, 1985), 49</ref> Some of these movements also began to hide weapons and plot sabotage. In the Zone Libre, movements were created as early as in the north and west but did not face decimating raids by the authorities, which allowed movements like ''Combat'', ''Lib\u00e9ration-Sud'' and ''Franc-Tireur'' to have a more expansive character\".<ref name=\"H.R. Kedward 1985\"/>\n\nResistance groups in the occupied zone eventually became linked to the Free French in London or the Special Operations Executive (SOE) set up by Britain to undermine Nazi-occupied Europe with specially trained agents.<ref name=\"H.R. Kedward 1985\"/> By May 1941, the northern movements, who specialized in sabotage and espionage and the southern movements, who focused on planning escape routes, developed the only major movement common to both, the ''Front National''.<ref name=\"H.R. Kedward 1985\"/> Resistance became closely linked with the effects of the occupation and Vichy legislation and as the working class became alienated \"resisters and people on the run could be harboured with a degree of safety\".<ref>H.R. Kedward :Resistance, in ''Occupied France: Collaboration and Resistance 1940\u20131944'' (New York: Basil Blackwell Ltd, 1985), 50</ref> in the rural areas of France, resistance had a role and justification in the lives of many people \"who had no ambition to hold a gun, or memorize a coded message, though as the occupation grew in its violence the pressure on the French people to defend themselves by force intensified, and the military nature of resistance came to predominate\".<ref>H.R. Kedward :Resistance, in ''Occupied France: Collaboration and Resistance 1940\u20131944'' (New York: Basil Blackwell Ltd, 1985), 51</ref> The connection between the Vichy government and armed resistance paved the way for the eventual formation of the Maquis.\n\nThe ''Service du Travail Obligatoire'' (S.T.O.) was enacted on 16 February 1943 but underwent various refinements and classifications.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">H. R. Kedward, \"Refusal and Revolt, Spring 1943\" in ''In Search of the Maquis: Rural Resistance in Southern France'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 19.</ref> It required young men born between 1920 and 1922 to register at their ''mairies'' (town halls), whereupon the authorities \u201clisted several categories of workers, divided them into those who were exempt, those who would be liable for compulsory service in Germany, and those who would have to work for German industries in France\u201d.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In the first few months, reports suggest that there were many who refused STO and went into hiding, mostly in areas where people hid Jews and resisters.<ref>H. R. Kedward,\"Refusal and Revolt, Spring 1943'', in ''In Search of the Maquis: Rural Resistance in Southern France'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 20.</ref> These first few months of refusal of S.T.O., and the \"embryonic camps and groupings that resulted\" contributed to the eventual emergence of the mystique and discourse of l''e Maquis''.<ref>H.

Kedward,\"Refusal and Revolt, Spring 1943\" in ''In Search of the Maquis: Rural Resistance in Southern France'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 28.</ref>\n\nPolitically motivated anti-fascists, immigrant workers on the run, the ''r\u00e9fractaires'' and Spanish Civil War veterans, along with the leniency of the Vichy administration's pursuit of ''r\u00e9fractaires'', contributed to the emergence of an aggressive movement, with a combative discourse and a romantic mystique of rural revolt.<ref name=\"R. Kedward 1943\"/> The speed with which the term \u2018''maquis''\u2019 spread was astonishing, since the concept did not exist in January 1943. By June, maquis discourse made its way from south-eastern France to the plains of northern France.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The Maquis eventually became the national service, due to the large influx of young people in revolt against the S.T.O.<ref name=\"Claude Chambard 1976\">Claude Chambard, \"The Making of an Army\" in ''The Maquis: A History of the French Resistance Movement'', ed. Elaine P.

This gave \u201cprimacy to isolation from all habitation, but also to sites which permitted hasty retreats\u201d.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">H. R.

Captain Romans described the situation: \"The watchwords were explicit: no large concentrations of men. No pitched battles. Guerrilla warfare only! We had a few revolvers and some hunting rifles and were reduced to making sketches in order to teach the use of modern weapons. Early in July we received our first Sten machine gun. We kept taking it apart and putting it together until we could do it in record time, Then the gun was passed from one camp to another.\"<ref>Claude Chambard, \"The Making of an Army,\" in ''The Maquis: A History of the French Resistance Movement'', ed. Elaine P. Halperin, (New York:Bobbs Merrill Company, Inc., 1976), 99.</ref>\n\nIn the control for rural areas, the maquisards, in their role as the hunted, \u201cgradually made the terrain of the hunt unpredictable for the hunters,\u201d<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> and eventually dangerous. The Maquis\u2019s goal was to destabilize Vichy authority, and they did this by simultaneously making themselves, as well as Vichy authorities, the \u2018hunters\u2019 and the \u2018hunted\u2019.<ref>H. R. Kedward,\"Hunters and Hunted, Summer-Autumn 1943,\" in ''In Search of the Maquis: Rural Resistance in Southern France'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 60.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Operation Overlord|Allied invasion of Normandy]], the Maquis and other groups played some role in delaying the German mobilization. The French Resistance (FFI ''Forces Fran\u00e7aises de l'Interieur'' for \"[[French Forces of the Interior]]\") blew up railroad tracks and repeatedly attacked German Army equipment and garrison trains on their way to the Atlantic coast. Coded messages transmitted over the [[Radio Londres|BBC radio]] alerted the maquis of the impending D-Day with seemingly meaningless messages such as \"the crow will sing three times in the morning\" read in a continuous flow over the British airwaves. As Allied troops advanced, the French Resistance rose against the Nazi [[military occupation|occupation]] forces and their garrisons en masse. For example, [[Nancy Wake]]'s group of 7,000 maquisards was involved in a pitched battle with 22,000 Germans on June 20, 1944. Some Maquis groups took no prisoners so some [[Germany|German]] soldiers preferred to surrender to Allied soldiers rather than maquisards.\n\nThe Allied offensive was slowed and the Germans were able to counterattack in southeast France. On the [[Vercors Massif]], the [[Maquis du Vercors]] rose up with some 4000 soldiers against the German occupiers, but was defeated with 600 casualties.\n\nWhen [[Charles de Gaulle|General De Gaulle]] dismissed resistance organizations after the liberation of Paris, many maquisards returned to their homes though many also joined the [[French First Army#1944-1945|new French army]].\n\n==Equipment==\nAlthough the Maquis used whatever arms they could get, they relied heavily on airdrops of weapons and explosives from the British [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]]. SOE parachuted agents in with wireless sets (for radio communication) and dropped containers with various munitions including [[Sten]] guns, [[pencil detonators]], [[plastic explosives]], [[Welrod]] pistols (a silenced specialized assassination weapon favored by covert operatives) and assorted small arms such as pistols, rifles and sub-machine guns. The Maquis also used German weapons captured throughout the occupation; the [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser 98k]] rifle and [[MP 40]] [[submachine gun]] were very common. In addition to equipment, but they also relied on the British SAS and other special operations units to teach them how to use explosives and other devices.\n\n==Customs==\nThe maquis were clandestine groups which did not wear uniforms, so as to blend in the population. However, over time many started wearing the  Basque [[beret]] because it was common enough not to arouse suspicion but distinctive enough to be effective.\n\nIn leadership and the more technical aspects of leading a resistance group women were often more involved in the Maquis than men, helping the front line fighters. It was very common for young educated women to be used as couriers from one maquis group to another. Young women were chosen because they were more inconspicuous than men and could often pass through German checkpoints without being stopped or questioned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol42no5/html/v42i5a03p.htm|title=1944: An Allied Team with the French Resistance \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> Allied operatives working with the maquis described the women of the Maquis helping of the fighters as \u201cthe lifeblood of the resistance, furnishing information, passing instructions, and arranging for food and supplies.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol42no5/html/v42i5a03p.htm|title=1944: An Allied Team with the French Resistance \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nMany individuals claimed membership in the maquis to escape being labeled [[Nazi collaborator]]s.

Initially, they were composed of men and women who had escaped into the mountains to avoid [[conscription]] into [[Vichy France]]'s  ''[[Service du travail obligatoire]]'' (\"Compulsory Work Service\" or ''STO'') to provide [[forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor for Germany]]. To avert capture and deportation to Germany, they became increasingly organized into active resistance groups.\n\n==Meaning==\nOriginally the word came from the kind of terrain in which the armed resistance groups hid, high ground in southeastern France covered with scrub growth called ''[[Maquis shrubland|maquis]]'' (shrubland).<ref name=\"Definition of maquis\">{{cite web| url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/maquis/| title=Definition of maquis| author=Online Etymology Dictionary| accessdate=2007-12-14}} from Dictionary.com website</ref> \n\nAlthough strictly speaking it means [[thicket]], ''maquis'' could be roughly translated as \"[[the bush]]\".<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Maquis Freedictionary definition: References in classic literature]</ref> Historians have not established how this [[Corsica]]n term arrived on the mainland of France.\n\n{{block quote|In Corsica, the saying ''Prendre le maquis'' 'to go into the bush' is used to describe someone who leaves the village in order to live in the bush, biding time to seek revenge, or are being pursued by people with and intent to arrest or kill.\n\nThe Italian-derived word \"''maquis''\" is commonly used to describe woods and scrubland on the island, and evokes an all-encompassing image of woods and mountains, whereas the more limited word \"''garrigue''\" used in the south of France indicated [...] an inhospitable terrain, and the words \"''bois''\" ('wood'), \"''foret''\" ('forest') and \"''montagne''\" ('mountain') were too bland.<ref name=\"R.

The maquis came to symbolize the French Resistance. The title Maquis is a very broad term that was used to describe a wide variety of different resistance groups throughout France. The Term Maquis describes resistance groups that fought in France before the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944. Once the Allies had secured a foothold in France the government of Free France attempted to unite the separate groups of Maquis under the banner of the [[French Forces of the Interior|FFI.]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=J3QJdqgisgMC&oi=fnd&pg=PP11&dq=maquis+Second+world+war&ots=WxVVh0mUlO&sig=zcYUvayLt_Jdw_DUQzOLVgK_KbM#v=onepage&q=maquis%20Second%20world%20war&f=false|title=France and the Second World War: Occupation, Collaboration and Resistance|last=Davies|first=Peter|date=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|year=|isbn=9780415238960|location=|pages=8|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Operations==\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumbnail|240px|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] d\u00e9partement in August 1944. Third and fourth from the right are two SOE officers. Second from right is probably [[Christine Granville]].]]\nMost maquisards operated in the remote or mountainous areas of [[Brittany]] and southern France, especially in the [[Alps]] and in [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]]. They relied on [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] to harass the [[Milice]] and German occupation troops. The Maquis also aided the escape of downed [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] airmen, [[Jews]] and others pursued by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] and German authorities. Maquisards usually relied on some degree of sympathy or cooperation from the local populace. In March 1944, the German army began a terror campaign throughout France.{{cn|date=July 2018}} This included reprisals against civilians living in areas where the French resistance was active, such as the [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|Oradour-sur-Glane]], [[Maill\u00e9 massacre|Maill\u00e9]] and [[Tulle massacre|Tulle]] massacres by SS troops. The Maquisards were later to take their revenge in the ''[[\u00e9puration sauvage]]'' that took place after the war's end.<ref name=\"\u00e9puration sauvage\">{{harvnb|Jackson|2003|p=577}}</ref>\n\nMost of the Maquis cells\u2014like the [[Maquis du Limousin]] or the [[Maquis du Vercors]]\u2014took names after the area they were operating in. The size of these cells varied from tens to thousands of men and women.\n\nIn [[French Indochina]], the local resistance fighting the Japanese since 1941 was backed up by a special forces airborne commando unit created by de Gaulle in 1943, and known as the [[Corps L\u00e9ger d'Intervention]] (CLI). They were supplied by airlifts of the British [[Force 136]].\n\n==Politics==\nPolitically, the Maquis were very diverse, including [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Communism|communists]], and [[Anarchism|anarchists]]. Some Maquis bands that operated in southwest France were composed entirely of [[Spanish Maquis|left-wing Spanish veterans]] of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Spanish Civil War veteran [[Carlos Romero Gim\u00e9nez]] was a center-democratic liberal operating from [[Bordeaux]].\n\nWhen Germany began a forced labor draft (''[[Service du travail obligatoire]], STO'') in France at the beginning of 1943, thousands of young men fled and joined the Maquis. The British [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) helped the Maquis with supplies and agents. The American [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) also began to send its own agents to France in cooperation with the SOE and the French [[Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action|BCRA]] agents, as part of [[Operation Jedburgh]]. The British government provided supplies and support to assist [[Charles de Gaulle]] to unify the [[Free French]] resistance movement.\n\nThe Maquis were a fractured organization that had many different sub groups with their own objectives and political affiliations. In 1944 an [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] agent by the name of \u00a0Robert R. Kehoe was embedded within a group of Maquis and described the organization as \u201cFractured.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol42no5/html/v42i5a03p.htm|title=1944: An Allied Team with the French Resistance \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> Also saying \u201cthe various components were quite independent, with members loyal to their own leaders and to the political forces behind them\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol42no5/html/v42i5a03p.htm|title=1944: An Allied Team with the French Resistance \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> Examples of the independence of separate Maquis groups can be found all throughout France during the Second World War.

In northern and western France, movements like ''Organisation Civile et Militaire'', ''Lib\u00e9ration-Nord'', ''Ceux de la Lib\u00e9ration'', ''Ceux de la R\u00e9sistance'' survived through clandestine pamphlets or newspapers, to build up a solidarity of attitudes and disparate actions and to taunt the Germans (''narguer les Allemands'').<ref name=\"H.R.

In the Zone Libre, movements were created as early as in the north and west but did not face decimating raids by the authorities, which allowed movements like ''Combat'', ''Lib\u00e9ration-Sud'' and ''Franc-Tireur'' to have a more expansive character\".<ref name=\"H.R. Kedward 1985\"/>\n\nResistance groups in the occupied zone eventually became linked to the Free French in London or the Special Operations Executive (SOE) set up by Britain to undermine Nazi-occupied Europe with specially trained agents.<ref name=\"H.R. Kedward 1985\"/> By May 1941, the northern movements, who specialized in sabotage and espionage and the southern movements, who focused on planning escape routes, developed the only major movement common to both, the ''Front National''.<ref name=\"H.R. Kedward 1985\"/> Resistance became closely linked with the effects of the occupation and Vichy legislation and as the working class became alienated \"resisters and people on the run could be harboured with a degree of safety\".<ref>H.R. Kedward :Resistance, in ''Occupied France: Collaboration and Resistance 1940\u20131944'' (New York: Basil Blackwell Ltd, 1985), 50</ref> in the rural areas of France, resistance had a role and justification in the lives of many people \"who had no ambition to hold a gun, or memorize a coded message, though as the occupation grew in its violence the pressure on the French people to defend themselves by force intensified, and the military nature of resistance came to predominate\".<ref>H.R. Kedward :Resistance, in ''Occupied France: Collaboration and Resistance 1940\u20131944'' (New York: Basil Blackwell Ltd, 1985), 51</ref> The connection between the Vichy government and armed resistance paved the way for the eventual formation of the Maquis.\n\nThe ''Service du Travail Obligatoire'' (S.T.O.) was enacted on 16 February 1943 but underwent various refinements and classifications.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">H. R. Kedward, \"Refusal and Revolt, Spring 1943\" in ''In Search of the Maquis: Rural Resistance in Southern France'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 19.</ref> It required young men born between 1920 and 1922 to register at their ''mairies'' (town halls), whereupon the authorities \u201clisted several categories of workers, divided them into those who were exempt, those who would be liable for compulsory service in Germany, and those who would have to work for German industries in France\u201d.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In the first few months, reports suggest that there were many who refused STO and went into hiding, mostly in areas where people hid Jews and resisters.<ref>H.

Kedward 1943\"/> The speed with which the term \u2018''maquis''\u2019 spread was astonishing, since the concept did not exist in January 1943. By June, maquis discourse made its way from south-eastern France to the plains of northern France.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The Maquis eventually became the national service, due to the large influx of young people in revolt against the S.T.O.<ref name=\"Claude Chambard 1976\">Claude Chambard, \"The Making of an Army\" in ''The Maquis: A History of the French Resistance Movement'', ed.

We had a few revolvers and some hunting rifles and were reduced to making sketches in order to teach the use of modern weapons. Early in July we received our first Sten machine gun. We kept taking it apart and putting it together until we could do it in record time, Then the gun was passed from one camp to another.\"<ref>Claude Chambard, \"The Making of an Army,\" in ''The Maquis: A History of the French Resistance Movement'', ed.

The Maquis\u2019s goal was to destabilize Vichy authority, and they did this by simultaneously making themselves, as well as Vichy authorities, the \u2018hunters\u2019 and the \u2018hunted\u2019.<ref>H. R. Kedward,\"Hunters and Hunted, Summer-Autumn 1943,\" in ''In Search of the Maquis: Rural Resistance in Southern France'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 60.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Operation Overlord|Allied invasion of Normandy]], the Maquis and other groups played some role in delaying the German mobilization. The French Resistance (FFI ''Forces Fran\u00e7aises de l'Interieur'' for \"[[French Forces of the Interior]]\") blew up railroad tracks and repeatedly attacked German Army equipment and garrison trains on their way to the Atlantic coast. Coded messages transmitted over the [[Radio Londres|BBC radio]] alerted the maquis of the impending D-Day with seemingly meaningless messages such as \"the crow will sing three times in the morning\" read in a continuous flow over the British airwaves. As Allied troops advanced, the French Resistance rose against the Nazi [[military occupation|occupation]] forces and their garrisons en masse. For example, [[Nancy Wake]]'s group of 7,000 maquisards was involved in a pitched battle with 22,000 Germans on June 20, 1944. Some Maquis groups took no prisoners so some [[Germany|German]] soldiers preferred to surrender to Allied soldiers rather than maquisards.\n\nThe Allied offensive was slowed and the Germans were able to counterattack in southeast France. On the [[Vercors Massif]], the [[Maquis du Vercors]] rose up with some 4000 soldiers against the German occupiers, but was defeated with 600 casualties.\n\nWhen [[Charles de Gaulle|General De Gaulle]] dismissed resistance organizations after the liberation of Paris, many maquisards returned to their homes though many also joined the [[French First Army#1944-1945|new French army]].\n\n==Equipment==\nAlthough the Maquis used whatever arms they could get, they relied heavily on airdrops of weapons and explosives from the British [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]]. SOE parachuted agents in with wireless sets (for radio communication) and dropped containers with various munitions including [[Sten]] guns, [[pencil detonators]], [[plastic explosives]], [[Welrod]] pistols (a silenced specialized assassination weapon favored by covert operatives) and assorted small arms such as pistols, rifles and sub-machine guns. The Maquis also used German weapons captured throughout the occupation; the [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser 98k]] rifle and [[MP 40]] [[submachine gun]] were very common. In addition to equipment, but they also relied on the British SAS and other special operations units to teach them how to use explosives and other devices.\n\n==Customs==\nThe maquis were clandestine groups which did not wear uniforms, so as to blend in the population. However, over time many started wearing the  Basque [[beret]] because it was common enough not to arouse suspicion but distinctive enough to be effective.\n\nIn leadership and the more technical aspects of leading a resistance group women were often more involved in the Maquis than men, helping the front line fighters. It was very common for young educated women to be used as couriers from one maquis group to another. Young women were chosen because they were more inconspicuous than men and could often pass through German checkpoints without being stopped or questioned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol42no5/html/v42i5a03p.htm|title=1944: An Allied Team with the French Resistance \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> Allied operatives working with the maquis described the women of the Maquis helping of the fighters as \u201cthe lifeblood of the resistance, furnishing information, passing instructions, and arranging for food and supplies.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol42no5/html/v42i5a03p.htm|title=1944: An Allied Team with the French Resistance \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nMany individuals claimed membership in the maquis to escape being labeled [[Nazi collaborator]]s.
