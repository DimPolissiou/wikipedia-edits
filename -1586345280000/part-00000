Ozark Mountain Oil, interested in purchasing his land, offers him $1 billion for the property. Unsure of what to do, Jed consults his cousin, Pearl Bodine ([[Linda Carlson]]), during a family dinner.  Pearl suggests a change of scenery for Jed's daughter, Elly May ([[Erika Eleniak]]), would be a good thing. Pearl and Jethrine convince them to move to Beverly Hills California. Ozark Mountain Oil came by Jed's place to check to see if Jed signed the contract.  Having made up his mind and signed the contract and move to Beverly Hills, Jed and his daughter, his mother-in-law Granny ([[Cloris Leachman]]), and his nephew, Jethro ([[Diedrich Bader]]), Pearl's son, load up Jethro's old, dilapidated truck with their possessions and move to [[Beverly Hills, California]], even though Granny is reluctant to come. \n\nMilburn Drysdale ([[Dabney Coleman]]), the [[CEO]] of the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills (where Jed's money is stored), sends out his secretary/assistant, Jane Hathaway ([[Lily Tomlin]]) to meet the Clampetts at their new estate that is next door to his. Jane calls the [[Beverly Hills Police Department|Beverly Hills Police]] after the Clampetts arrive, mistaking them for burglars. Upon learning of Jane's mistake at the police station, Drysdale briefly fires her. But seeing that Jed insists that he still wants her to watch over his affairs, Drysdale rehires her.\n\nThe Clampetts settle into their new surroundings. Drysdale pushes his reluctant son, Morgan Drysdale ([[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]]), into befriending Elly May, to whom he eventually develops an attraction. Jane is also smitten by Jethro, who seems ignorant of her affections.\n\nJed requests Jane's assistance in helping him search for someone who will help turn Elly May into a lady and also wants to get married.  So Miss Hathaway has to play matchmaker. Woodrow Tyler ([[Rob Schneider]]), an employee in Drysdale's bank, catches wind of this and contrives a scheme with his con artist girlfriend, Laura Jackson ([[Lea Thompson]]), to steal Jed's money by having her marry Jed.  She poses as a French etiquette teacher, Laurette Voleur,<ref>''[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/voleur Voleur]'' is French for ''thief'', per the ''Collins French to English Dictionary''.

Granny reveals herself to the pair and threatens to expose their scam to Jed, and the impending wedding will be off. But before she can, they capture her, restrain her, and have her institutionalized at the Los Viejos Nursing Home so she cannot contact Jed.\n\nAt the wedding, Woodrow prepares to transfer all of Clampett's money in Drysdale's bank to a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] account on his [[laptop]] computer when the couple says \"I do\". Jane realizing Granny is missing, goes to the office of [[Barnaby Jones]] ([[Buddy Ebsen]]) and after learning where Granny is and who Laura is, poses as a nurse and breaks her out. Granny and Jane arrive at the wedding and foil Laura and Tyler's plan when Jane grabs a shotgun and blows the laptop to bits, before they tried to steal Jed's money.

The population was 401 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], up from 381 in 2000. [[Iowa Highway 136]] passes through Worthington, which is situated north of [[Cascade, Iowa|Cascade]] and south of [[Dyersville, Iowa|Dyersville]].\n\n==History==\n{{unref section|date=March 2020}}\nThe land on which Worthington is currently located was originally purchased by David Lovelace from the United States Government. The Dubuque South-Western Railroad \u2014 the local branch of the Chicago-Milwaukee and St. Paul lines \u2014 was contracted to establish a line from [[Farley, Iowa|Farley]] to [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]]. In 1858, an Englishman named Amos Worthington came to the area to establish a general store. By November of that year, the area became an unincorporated town known as the village of Worthington. By May of the following year regular rail service was established. A plat of Worthington was established with the Dubuque county recorder in 1858.\n\nIn 1861, Worthington sold his store to a William Moore and left for [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. Eventually this store became known as the Heffner and Lattner Store. Settlers also began arriving in the area, with a number of people setting up businesses.\n\nSoon a Baptist church was established in Worthington, with James Hill as Pastor. In 1868 Father Kortenkamp of St. Francis parish in[[Dyersville, Iowa|Dyersville]] decided that Worthington was large enough to merit its own Catholic parish, and [[Saint Paul's Catholic Church (Worthington)|St. Paul's Catholic Church]] was begun.\n\nOn October 1, 1892, a number of local citizens filed a petition in the District Court of Iowa in and for Dubuque County asking for Worthington to be formally incorporated as a town. On November 23, the court called for village inhabitants Peter Baum, W. Lattner, G.A. Dando, Louis Hoppleu, and Theodore Ament to act as commissioners. As commissioners they were to call for a special election of all qualified people in the proposed area to vote on the matter of being incorporated. This election was held on January 2, 1893. There were 42 votes cast \u2014 32 were for the proposal and ten were against. On January 10, 1893, the Clerk of the District Court reported that the election was held.\n\nThe notice of the incorporation election was posted in the Dyersville Commercial for several weeks, with the last notice being published on February 17, 1893. Then on March 6, 1893 the results of the election were formally certified by the District Court Clerk \u2014 finalizing the incorporation of Worthington, Iowa. The formal date of incorporation of Worthington was set as January 2, 1893 when the special election had taken place.\n\n==Geography==\nWorthington is located at {{coord|42|23|48|N|91|7|10|W|type:city}} (42.396745, -91.119529).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|0.39|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all land.<ref name =\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title= Historical populations\n|type= USA\n|align= left\n|1880|169\n|1900|288\n|1910|314\n|1920|341\n|1930|335\n|1940|326\n|1950|337\n|1960|360\n|1970|365\n|1980|432\n|1990|439\n|2000|381\n|2010|401\n|2018|398\n|source=<center>U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref></center>\n|footnote=Source:{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|title=American FactFinder|access-date=2020-03-29|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212063637/http://factfinder.census.gov/|archive-date=2020-02-12|url-status=dead}} and [http://data.iowadatacenter.org/datatables/PlacesAll/plpopulation18502000.pdf Iowa Data Center]\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref> of 2010, there were 401 people, 160 households, and 109 families residing in the city.

It is the largest city in the [[Kurzeme Planning Region|Kurzeme Region]] and the third largest city in the country after [[Riga]] and [[Daugavpils]]. It is an important [[ice-free port]]. In 2017 population of Liep\u0101ja is 69,443 people.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th century it was a favourite place for sea-bathers with the town boasting a fine park and many pretty gardens, and a theatre.<ref>Murray, 1875, p.85.</ref> Liep\u0101ja is however known throughout Latvia as \"City where the wind is born\", likely because of the constant sea breeze. A song of the same name ({{lang-lv|\"Pils\u0113t\u0101, kur\u0101 piedzimst v\u0113j\u0161\"}}) was composed by [[Imants Kalni\u0146\u0161]] and has become the anthem of the city. Its reputation as the windiest city in Latvia was strengthened with the construction of the largest [[wind farm]] in the nation (33 [[Enercon]] wind turbines) nearby.\n\nThe coat of arms of Liep\u0101ja was adopted four days after the jurisdiction gained [[city rights]] on 18 March 1625.<ref name=\"siteliepaja\"/> These are described as: \"on a silver background, the lion of [[Courland]] with a divided tail, who leans upon a [[tilia|linden]] ({{lang-lv|Liepa}}) tree with its forelegs\". The flag of Liep\u0101ja has the coat of arms in the center, with red in the top half and green in the bottom.<ref name=\"siteliepaja\"/>\n\nOne of the very few surviving films documenting the mass murder of Jews shot into pits at the first stages of the Holocaust is a short film by a German soldier who witnessed the massacre of Liep\u0101ja Jews in July 1941 near the lighthouse.<ref name=\"dochol\" />  \n\n=={{anchor|Names and toponymy}}Names and toponymy==\n{{see also|Names of Liep\u0101ja in different languages|}}\n\nIt is said{{by whom|date=April 2017}} that the first settlement at the location of modern Liep\u0101ja was known by the name ''L\u012bva'' from the name of the river [[L\u012bva (river)|L\u012bva]] on which Liep\u0101ja was located. The name was derived from the [[Livonian language|Livonian]] word ''Liiv'' meaning \"sand\". The oldest written text mentioning L\u012bva village (''Villa Liva'') is the treaty of [[Bishopric of Courland|bishop of Courland]] and the master of the [[Livonian Order]] dated 4 April 1253. In 1263, the [[Teutonic Order]] established a town which they called ''Libau'' in [[German language|German]]. The Latvian name ''Liep\u0101ja'' was mentioned for the first time in 1649 by [[Paul Einhorn]] in his work ''[[Historia Lettica]]''. A [[Russian language|Russian]] name from the time of the [[Russian Empire]] was {{lang|ru|\u041b\u0438\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430}}<ref name=\"KNAB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eki.ee/knab/p_mm_en.htm |title=KNAB, the Place Names Database of EKI |publisher=Eki.ee |accessdate=20 April 2017}}</ref> (''Libava'') or {{lang|ru|\u041b\u0438\u0431\u0430\u0443}} (''Libau''), although {{lang|ru|\u041b\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0430\u044f}} (''Liepaya''), a transliteration of Liep\u0101ja, has been used since World War II.\n\nSome other names for the city include ''Liepoja'' in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]],<ref name=\"KNAB\"/> ''Lipawa'' in [[Polish language|Polish]]<ref name=\"KNAB\"/> and {{lang|yi|\u05dc\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0\u05b7\u05f0\u05e2|rtl=yes}} (''Libaveh'') in [[Yiddish]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nIt is said{{by whom|date=April 2017}} that the original settlement at the location of modern Liep\u0101ja was founded by [[Curonians|Curonian]] fishermen from [[Piemare]] as ''L\u012bva'', but Henry (Henricus Lettus) of [[Livonia]], in his famous ''Chronicle'', makes no mention of the settlement. The [[Teutonic Order]] established a town which they called ''Libau'' here in 1263, followed by [[Jelgava|Mitau]] two years later. In 1418 the village was sacked and burned by the [[Lithuanians]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}<ref>Turnbull, Stephen, ''Tannenberg 1410'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford UK, 2003, p.82: Certainly Poland & Lithuania invaded Prussia again in 1422, but no mentions of Libau.</ref>\n\n===Livonian confederation===\nDuring the 15th century, a part of the trade route from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Moscow]] passed through L\u012bva, where it was known as the \"white road to ''Lyva portus''\". By 1520 the river L\u012bva had become too shallow for easy navigation, and development of the city declined.\n\n=== Duchy of Courland and Semigallia ===\nIn 1560, [[Gotthard Kettler]] loaned all the Grobi\u0146a district, including Libau, to [[Albert, Duke of Prussia]] for 50,000 [[Rhenish guilder|gulden]]s. Only in 1609 after the marriage of [[Sofie Hohenzollern]], Princess of Prussia, to [[Wilhelm Kettler]] did the territory return to the Duchy. During the [[Livonian War]], Libau was attacked and burnt by the Swedes.\n\nIn 1625, Duke [[Friedrich Kettler]] of [[Courland]] granted the town city rights, which were affirmed by King [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]] of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] in 1626, although under what legal authority Sigismund had is debatable. Under Duke [[Jacob Kettler]] (1642\u20131681), Libau became one of the main ports of Courland as it reached the height of its prosperity. In 1637 [[Couronian colonization]] was started from the ports of Libau and [[Ventspils]] (Windau). Kettler was an eager proponent of mercantilist ideas. Metalworking and ship building became much more developed, and trading relations developed not only with nearby countries, but also with Britain, France, the Netherlands and Portugal.\n\nIn 1697\u20131703 a canal was cut to the sea and a more modern port was built.<ref name=\"BSE\"/> In 1701, during the [[Great Northern War]], Libau was captured by [[Charles XII of Sweden]], but by the end of the war, the city had returned to titular Polish possession.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> In 1710 an epidemic of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] killed about a third of the population. In 1780 the first [[Freemasonry]] lodge, \"Libanons,\" was established by Provincial Grand Master [[Ivan Yelagin]] on behalf of the Provincial Lodge of Russia; it was registered as number 524 in the [[Grand Lodge of England]].<ref name=\"masonicum\"/>\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nCourland passed to the control of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1795 during the third [[Partition of Poland]] and was organized as the [[Courland Governorate]] of Russia. Growth during the nineteenth century was rapid. During the [[Crimean War]], when the British [[Royal Navy]] was blockading Russian Baltic ports, the busy yet still unfortified port of Libau was [[Arthur Cumming (Royal Navy officer)#Crimean War|briefly captured]] on 17 May 1854 without a shot being fired, by a landing party of 110 men from HMS ''Conflict'' and HMS ''Amphion''.<ref name=\"amphion\"/>\n\nIn 1857 an Imperial Decree provided for a new railway to Libau,<ref>Palmer, Alan, ''Northern Shores'', London, 2005, p.215.</ref> and the same year the engineer [[Jan Heidatel]] developed a project to reconstruct the port. In 1861\u20131868 the project was realized \u2013 including the building of a [[Liep\u0101ja Lighthouse|lighthouse]] and breakwaters. Between 1877\u20131882 the political and literary weekly newspaper ''Liep\u0101jas Pastnieks'' was published \u2013 the first [[Latvian language]] newspaper in Libau.<ref name=\"liepajasp\"/> In the 1870s the further rapid development of Russian [[railways]], especially the 1871 opening of the Libava-[[Kaunas]] and the 1876 [[Liep\u0101ja\u2013Romny Railway]]s, ensured that a large proportion of central Russian trade passed through Libau.<ref name=\"BE1\"/> By 1900, 7% of Russian exports were passing through Libau. The city became a major port of the Russian Empire on the Baltic Sea, as well as a popular resort.\n\nOn the orders of [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], Libau was fortified against possible German attacks. [[Libava fortress|Fortifications]] were subsequently built around the city, and in the early 20th century, a major military base was established on the northern edge. It included formidable coastal fortifications and extensive quarters for military personnel. As part of the military development, a separate port was excavated for exclusively military use. This area became known as [[Karosta|Kara Osta]] (War Port) and served military needs throughout the twentieth century.\n\nEarly in the twentieth century, the port of Libau became a central point of embarkation for immigrants traveling to the United States and Canada. By 1906 the direct ship service to the United States was used by 40,000 migrants per year. Simultaneously, the first Russian training school of submarine navigation was founded. In 1912 one of the first water aerodromes in Russia was opened in Libau.<ref name=\"Gse1\"/> In 1913, 1,738 ships entered Libau, with 1,548,119 tonnes of cargo passing through the port. The population had increased from 10,000 to over 100,000 within about 60 years.\n\n=== World War I and War of Independence ===\n[[File:\u041b\u0438\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430 5 \u0440\u0443\u0431 1915 \u0430.jpg|thumb|left|Libau's 5 rubles (1915)]]\nFollowing the outbreak of [[World War I]], the German cruiser SMS ''Magdeburg'' shelled Libau, and other vessels laid mines off the approaches to the port.<ref>Palmer, 2005, p.255</ref> Libau was soon occupied by the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]], on 7 May 1915, and in memory of this event, a monument was constructed on K\u016brm\u0101jas Prospect in 1916 (destroyed by [[Bolsheviks]] in 1919). Libau's local government issued its own money for a while in this period \u2013 ''Libaua rubles''. An advanced German [[Zeppelin]] base was constructed at Vai\u0146ode, near Liep\u0101ja, with five hangars, in August 1915.<ref>Palmer, 2005, p.258.</ref> On 23 October 1915, the German cruiser {{SMS|Prinz Adalbert}} was sunk by the British submarine {{HMS|E8}}, {{convert|37|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Libau.\n\nWith the collapse of Russia and the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], the occupying German forces had a quiet, time but the subsequent collapse of the German Empire and the Allied denunciation of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty changed everything. Independence of the Republic of Latvia was proclaimed on 18 November 1918, and the [[Latvian Provisional Government]] under [[Karlis Ulmanis]] was created. Bolshevik Russia now advanced into Latvian territory and met little resistance here. Soon the Provisional Government and remaining German units were forced to leave [[Riga]] and retreated all the way to Liep\u0101ja, but then the Red offensive stalled along the [[Venta]] river. A Latvian Soviet Republic was announced. Latvia now became the main theatre of Baltic operations for the remaining German forces in 1919. In addition, a ''Landeswehr'' was formed to work in conjunction with the German forces.\n\nIn Liep\u0101ja, a coup organized by Germans took place on 16 April 1919 and Ulmanis government was forced to flee and was replaced by [[Andrievs Niedra]].<ref name=\"\u0160ili\u0146\u0161\">{{cite news |last1=\u0160ili\u0146\u0161 |first1=J\u0101nis |title=The republic on the sea: The 1919 coup that exiled the Latvian government to a steamboat |url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/culture/history/the-republic-on-the-sea-the-1919-coup-that-exiled-the-latvian-government-to-a-steamboat.a316422/ |accessdate=21 April 2019 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]] |date=18 April 2019}}</ref> The Ulmanis government found shelter on the steamship \"Saratov\" in Liep\u0101ja port.

However, when a Riga branch of the bank was opened, the business centre of gravity shifted from Liep\u0101ja so that by 1923 its Riga 'branch' was responsible for 90% of the turnover. The German consul in Liep\u0101ja reported at the time that \"Riga, the economic heart of the country, draws all business to itself.\" The Latvian government ignored the pleas of the Libau Exchange Association to frustrate this.<ref>Hiden, John, ''The Baltic States and Weimar Ostpolitik'', Cambridge University Press, UK, 1987, p.101-3.</ref> In 1935 KOD ({{lang-lv|Kara ostas darbn\u012bcas}}) started to manufacture the light aircraft [[KOD-1]] and [[KOD-2]] at Liep\u0101ja.  However it became evident in this year that trade with the new Soviet Union had virtually collapsed.<ref>Hiden & Salmon, 1991, p.78.</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\n{{See also|Liep\u0101ja massacres}}\n[[File:Karaflotes bazes izv liepaja.jpg|thumb|left|Top secret USSR document about creating a closed military port in Liep\u0101ja.

He signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact]] in part to gain control of this territory. When the Soviet Union [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|occupied and annexed Latvia in 1940]], it nationalized private property. Many thousands of former owners were arrested and [[June deportation|deported]] to the gulag camps in [[Siberia]].\n\nIn 1941 Liep\u0101ja was among the first cities captured by the [[291st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|291st Infantry Division]] of [[Army Group North]] after Nazi Germany began [[Operation Barbarossa]], its war against the Soviet Union. German Nazis and Latvian collaborators virtually [[Liep\u0101ja massacres|exterminated]] the local Jewish population, which had numbered about 7,000 before the war. Film footage of an [[Einsatzgruppen]] execution of local Jews was taken in Liep\u0101ja.<ref name=\"filmabouthol\"/><ref name=\"dochol\"/> Most of these mass murders took place in the dunes of [[\u0160\u0137\u0113de]] north of the city. Fewer than thirty Jews survived in Liep\u0101ja by the end of the war.\n\nDuring the war, the German navy's U-boat crews received their torpedo training at Liep\u0101ja.\n\nDuring the period 1944\u20131945, as the Soviet Union began its offensive to the Baltic Sea, Liep\u0101ja was within the \"[[Courland Pocket]]\". It was occupied by the [[Red Army]] on 9 May 1945. Thousands of Latvians fled as refugees to Germany. The city had been devastated during the war, and most of the buildings and industrial plant were destroyed.\n\n=== Latvian SSR ===\nOn 25\u201329 March 1949, the Soviet Union organized a second [[Operation Priboi|mass deportation]] to [[Siberia]] from Liep\u0101ja. In 1950 a monument to Stalin was erected on Station square ({{lang-lv|Stacijas laukums}}). It was dismantled in 1958 after the Party Congress that discussed his abuses.\n\nDuring 1953\u20131957 the city center was reconstructed under the direction of architects A. Kruglov and M. \u017dagare.<ref name=\"BSE\"/> In 1952\u20131955 the [[University of Liep\u0101ja|Liep\u0101ja Academy of Pedagogy]] building was constructed under the direction of A. Aivars. In 1960 the ''Kurzeme'' shopping centre was opened. During the Soviet administration, Liep\u0101ja was a [[closed city]]; even local farmers and villagers needed a special permit to enter it.\n\nThe Soviet military set up its Baltic naval base and [[nuclear weapon]] warehouses there; The Beberli\u0146\u0161 [[sandpit]] was dug out to extract sand used for constructing underground warehouses. In 1967 the Soviets completely closed the port to commercial traffic. One third of the city was taken up with a Soviet naval base; its military staff numbered 26,000. The 14th Submarine Squadron of the USSR's [[Baltic Fleet]] (''{{lang-ru|link=no|14 \u044d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043b\u044c\u044f \u041b\u0438\u0412\u041c\u0411 \u0414\u041a\u0411\u0424}}'', call sign \"\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\") was stationed there with 16 submarines (Types: [[Whiskey class submarine|613]], [[Golf class submarine|629a]], [[Juliett class submarine|651]]); as was the 6th group of Rear Supply of the Baltic Fleet, and the 81st Design Bureau and Reserve Command Center of the same force.\n\nIn 1977 Liep\u0101ja was awarded the [[Order of the October Revolution]] for heroic defense against Nazi Germany in 1941. Five residents were awarded the honorary title [[Hero of Socialist Labor]]: Anatolijs Filatkins, Art\u016brs Fridrihsons, Voldem\u0101rs Lazdups, Valentins \u0160uvajevs and Ot\u012blija \u017dagata. Because of the rapid growth of the city's population, a shortage of apartment houses resulted. To resolve this, the Soviet government organized development of most of the modern Liep\u0101ja districts: [[Dienvidrietumi (Liep\u0101ja)|Dienvidrietumi]], [[Ezerkrasts]], [[Zieme\u013cu priek\u0161pils\u0113ta (Liep\u0101ja)|Zieme\u013cu priek\u0161pils\u0113ta]], [[Za\u013c\u0101 birze]] and [[Tosmare]]. The majority of these blocks were constructed of ferro-concrete panels in standard projects designed by the state [[Latgyprogorstroy]] Institute (''{{lang-ru|link=no|\u041b\u0430\u0442\u0433\u0438\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439}}''). In 1986 the new central city hospital in [[Za\u013ca birze]] was opened.<ref name=\"slimnica\"/> \n[[File:Soviet blocks, Liepaja.jpg|thumbnail|right|Soviet-era apartment blocks in Liep\u0101ja]]\n\n=== 1990\u2013present ===\nAfter Latvia regained independence after the fall of the Soviet Union, Liep\u0101ja has worked hard to change from a military city into a modern port city (again appearing on European maps after the secrecy of the Soviet period). The commercial port was re-opened in 1991, and in 1994 the last [[Russian Federation|Russian]] troops left Liep\u0101ja. Since then, Liep\u0101ja has engaged in international co-operation, has been associated with 10 twin and partner cities, and is an active partner in several co-operation networks. Facilities are being improved. The city is the location of Latvia's largest [[Military of Latvia|naval flotilla]], the largest warehouses of [[ammunition]] and weapons in the Baltic states, and the main supply centre of the Latvian army.\n\nThe former closed military town has been transformed into the northern neighbourhood of [[Karosta]], occupying a third of the area of the city of Liep\u0101ja and attracting tourists to the remaints of the military era.<ref>[https://www.latvia.travel/en/sight/liepaja-naval-port Liep\u0101ja Naval Port]</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, many ambitious construction projects were planned for the city, including a [[NATO]] military base, and Baltic Sea Park, planned as the biggest amusement park in the [[Baltic states]]. Most of the projects have not yet been realised due to economic and political factors. Liep\u0101ja's heating network was renovated with the cooperation of French and Russian companies: [[Veolia Energy-Dalkia|Dalkia]] and [[Gazprom]], respectively. In 2006, Queen [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]], a direct descendant of [[Jacob Kettler]] visited Liep\u0101ja. In 2010 the coal [[cogeneration]] 400 MW power plant was built in Liep\u0101ja with the support of the government.\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Liepaja LVA climate.svg|right|Liepaja's temperature and precipitation distribution]]\n\nLiep\u0101ja enjoys a semi-continental climate noted as \"Dfb\" in the K\u00f6ppen classification. The major factor influencing the weather in the region is the [[Baltic Sea]], providing a relatively mild winter for its high latitude (although snowy) and a relatively cool summer. During the winter the sea around Liep\u0101ja is virtually ice-free. Although occasionally some [[land-fast ice]] may develop, it seldom reaches a hundred meters from the shore and does not last long before melting. The sea warms up fully only in the beginning of August, so the best bathing season in Liep\u0101ja is from August to September. Summers are more affected by the maritime climate than east-facing cities on similar latitudes in opposite [[Sweden]], but winters are milder than inland areas to the east. Regular meteorological observations in the city have been conducted from 1857.\n\n* Average temperatures:\n: February: {{convert|-3.1|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}\n: July: {{convert|16.0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}\n\n* Absolute minimum of temperature: {{convert|-33|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}\n* Absolute maximum of temperature: {{convert|34|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}\n* Number of sunny days per year: 196\n* Average speed of wind: 5.8 [[metre per second|m/s]] (13&nbsp;mph)\n* Average annual norm of precipitation (mostly rain): {{convert|692|mm|1|abbr=on}} \n* Typical wind directions: in the winter \u2013 southern, in the summer \u2013 western.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Liepaja (1981\u20132010 temp and precipitation, 1961\u20131990 sun, humidity)\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 7.9\n|Feb record high C = 15.5\n|Mar record high C = 17.8\n|Apr record high C = 24.5\n|May record high C = 30.0\n|Jun record high C = 32.7\n|Jul record high C = 33.7\n|Aug record high C = 33.6\n|Sep record high C = 30.7\n|Oct record high C = 22.2\n|Nov record high C = 15.4\n|Dec record high C = 10.1\n|year record high C = 33.7\n|Jan high C = 0.8\n|Feb high C = 0.7\n|Mar high C = 3.8\n|Apr high C = 9.8\n|May high C = 15.3\n|Jun high C = 17.9\n|Jul high C = 21.0\n|Aug high C = 21.0\n|Sep high C = 16.5\n|Oct high C = 11.3\n|Nov high C = 5.6\n|Dec high C = 2.3\n|year high C = 10.5\n|Jan mean C = -1.3\n|Feb mean C = -1.7\n|Mar mean C = 1.0\n|Apr mean C = 6.0\n|May mean C = 11.2\n|Jun mean C = 14.3\n|Jul mean C = 17.4\n|Aug mean C = 17.4\n|Sep mean C = 13.2\n|Oct mean C = 8.6\n|Nov mean C = 3.6\n|Dec mean C = 0.3\n|year mean C = 7.6\n|Jan low C = -3.3\n|Feb low C = -4.1\n|Mar low C = -1.9\n|Apr low C = 2.2\n|May low C = 7.0\n|Jun low C = 10.7\n|Jul low C = 13.8\n|Aug low C = 13.7\n|Sep low C = 9.9\n|Oct low C = 5.9\n|Nov low C = 1.5\n|Dec low C = -1.8\n|year low C = 4.5\n|Jan record low C = -32.9\n|Feb record low C = -31.6\n|Mar record low C = -23.8\n|Apr record low C = -10.1\n|May record low C = -4.3\n|Jun record low C = 0.5\n|Jul record low C = 4.8\n|Aug record low C = 4.6\n|Sep record low C = -1.7\n|Oct record low C = -7.3\n|Nov record low C = -17.5\n|Dec record low C = -25.8\n|year record low C = -32.9\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 58.5\n|Feb precipitation mm = 42.2\n|Mar precipitation mm = 46.5\n|Apr precipitation mm = 43.0\n|May precipitation mm = 41.2\n|Jun precipitation mm = 56.0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 72.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 77.9\n|Sep precipitation mm = 81.9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 89.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 87.8\n|Dec precipitation mm = 73.7\n|year precipitation mm = 762.9\n|Jan precipitation days = 13.7\n|Feb precipitation days = 9.9\n|Mar precipitation days = 10.6\n|Apr precipitation days = 7.1\n|May precipitation days = 6.9\n|Jun precipitation days = 8.3\n|Jul precipitation days = 8.8\n|Aug precipitation days = 10.0\n|Sep precipitation days = 12.0\n|Oct precipitation days = 13.8\n|Nov precipitation days = 15.6\n|Dec precipitation days = 14.5\n|year precipitation days = 130.1\n|Jan humidity = 87.2\n|Feb humidity = 85.8\n|Mar humidity = 82.8\n|Apr humidity = 76.3\n|May humidity = 75.7\n|Jun humidity = 77.4\n|Jul humidity = 78.9\n|Aug humidity = 78.5\n|Sep humidity = 80.5\n|Oct humidity = 82.9\n|Nov humidity = 87.4\n|Dec humidity = 86.9\n|year humidity = 81.7\n|Jan sun = 34\n|Feb sun = 64\n|Mar sun = 130\n|Apr sun = 187\n|May sun = 273\n|Jun sun = 295\n|Jul sun = 279\n|Aug sun = 248\n|Sep sun = 173\n|Oct sun = 103\n|Nov sun = 43\n|Dec sun = 28\n|year sun = 1857\n|source 1 = [[NOAA]] (sun 1961\u20131990)<ref name = HKO>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_VI/LV/26406.TXT\n| title = Liepaja Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n| accessdate = 28 November 2013}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Weatherbase (precipitation, humidity, extremes)<ref name = weatherbase>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=264060\n| title = Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Griuzupe, Latvia\n| publisher = Weatherbase\n| accessdate = 4 February 2013}}</ref> Source #3: M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat<ref>{{cite web\n| url= http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/listenormale-1981-2010-1-p125.php\n| title= Liepaja Climate Normals 1981\u20132010\n| publisher= M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat\n| accessdate= 11 October 2017}}</ref>\n|date=November 2011\n}}\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Liepaja-Beach.jpg|thumbnail|right|Beach in Liep\u0101ja]]\nLiep\u0101ja is situated on the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] in the south-western part of Latvia. The westernmost geographical point of Latvia is located approximately {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south thus making Liep\u0101ja Latvia's furthest west city. Liep\u0101ja is situated between the Baltic Sea and [[Liep\u0101ja Lake]] with residential and industrial areas spreading north of the lake. The Trade Channel ({{lang|lv|Tirdzniec\u012bbas kan\u0101ls}}) connects the lake to the sea dividing the city into southern and northern parts, which are often referred to as the Old Town ({{lang|lv|Vecliep\u0101ja}}) and the New Town ({{lang|lv|Jaunliep\u0101ja}}) respectively. The city center is located in the southern part and, although called the Old Town, is relatively more developed. Most of the administrative and cultural buildings are found here as well as the main leisure areas. Along the coast the city extends northwards until it reaches the [[Karosta]] Channel ({{lang|lv|Karostas kan\u0101ls}}). North of the Karosta Channel is an area called [[Karosta]] which is now fully integrated into Liep\u0101ja and is the northernmost district of the city. Liep\u0101ja's coastline consists of an unbroken sandy beach and dunes as does most of Latvia's coastline. The beach of Liep\u0101ja is not as exploited as other places (e.g. the [[Gulf of Riga]], [[J\u016brmala]] and [[P\u00e4rnu]] in Estonia) but also lacks the tourist infrastructure needed for a fashionable, modern resort.\n\n=== J\u016brmala Park ===\n\nJ\u016brmala Park (Seaside Park) is located in the western part of the city at the seaside. The park is {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} long with a total area of 70 ha and is one of the largest planted parks in Latvia. It was developed at the end of the 19th century.\nAt the end of Peldu Street are Latvia's largest drums \u2013 one of the objects of Liep\u0101ja's environmental design which reminds one that Liep\u0101ja is the music capital of Latvia.\nThe open-air concert stage P\u016bt, v\u0113ji\u0146i! (Blow, wind, blow!) was built in 1964. It has been the venue for a good many concerts and festivals, with the festival \"Liep\u0101jas Dzintars\" (\"Amber of Liep\u0101ja\") being the most famous among them, as it could be regarded as the oldest rock festival of the former Soviet Union. It was held for the first time in 1968.\nAlongside the stage is an interesting building, the former Bath House built in 1902 and designed by Max Paul Bertschy. At the beginning of the 19th century Liep\u0101ja was a renowned health resort and the Russian tsar and his family had been visiting Liep\u0101ja. This all encouraged other aristocrats from Russia and Europe to spend their summers in Liep\u0101ja as well.\n\n=== Libava fortress ===\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, [[Libava fortress]] was the most expensive and ambitious project of the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]] on the Baltic Sea. The massive concrete fortifications with eight cannon batteries was built to protect the city and its population from German attacks. The fortress' secret underground passages figure heavily in the city's most famous [[urban legend]]s.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== Districts ===\n# [[Vecliep\u0101ja]]\n# [[Ezerkrasts]]\n# [[Dienvidrietumu rajons (Liep\u0101ja)|Dienvidrietumu rajons]]\n# [[Zieme\u013cu priek\u0161pils\u0113ta (Liep\u0101ja)|Zieme\u013cu priek\u0161pils\u0113ta]]\n# [[Jaunliep\u0101ja]]\n# [[Velnciems]]\n# [[Karosta]]\n# [[Tosmare]]\n# [[Za\u013c\u0101 birze]]\n# [[Jauna Pasaule (Liep\u0101ja)|Jauna Pasaule]]\n\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== Suburbs ===\n# [[Aucugals]]\n# [[Gr\u012bnvalti]]\n# [[P\u0113rkone]]\n# [[Cimdenieki]]\n# [[Kaps\u0113de]]\n# [[\u0160\u0137\u0113de]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n=== Closest cities ===\n\nThe closest city to Liep\u0101ja is [[Grobi\u0146a]], located about {{convert|10|km|mi}} away towards [[Riga]]. Other main cities in the region are [[Klaip\u0117da]] (approx. {{convert|110|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south), [[Ventspils]] (approx. {{convert|115|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and [[Saldus]] (approx. {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east). The distance to Riga (the capital of Latvia) is about {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east. The nearest point to Liep\u0101ja across the Baltic sea is the [[Sweden|Swedish]] island of [[Gotland]] approximately {{convert|160|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north-west. The distance to [[Stockholm]] is 216 [[nautical mile]]s.\n{{Geographic Location|width = auto\n|title     = '''Neighbouring areas'''\n|Northwest = \n|North     = [[Pavilosta]], [[Ventspils]]\n|Northeast = [[Aizpute]]\n|West      = \n|Centre    = [[Liepaja]]\n|East      = [[Grobina]]\n|Southwest = \n|South     = [[N\u012bca]]\n|Southeast = \n}}\n\n== Architecture and sightseeing ==\n\nLiep\u0101ja is rich in different architecture styles: wooden houses, [[Art Nouveau]] buildings, Soviet-era apartments and a number of green parks all contribute to the character of the city. The main areas of interest for tourists include the city center with its many churches, the [[Liep\u0101ja seaside park|Seaside park]] with white sandy beaches and the northern suburb of [[Karosta]], a former secret military encampment which is now a major tourist attraction. Other areas of interest for tourists are [[Vecliep\u0101ja]]; [[Ezerkrasts]], which is close to Liep\u0101ja lake; and the Karosta beaches with their picturesque blasted forts.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== Monuments and memorials ===\n* [[Monument to the sailors and fishermen perished in the sea (Liep\u0101ja)|Monument to the sailors and fishermen lost at sea]] \u2013 1977\n* Monument to the Defenders of Liep\u0101ja in 1941\u20131960\n* Monument to 1919 Freedom Fighters\n* Monument to [[Mirdza \u0136empe]] \u2013 1989\n* Monument to [[\u0112valds Rimbenieks]] \u2013 2008\n* Memorial wall in [[Za\u013ca birze]]\n* [[Nikolay Dedaev Monument]]\n* Statue of [[Hermes]] (Liela 10)\n* 1 Rock Caf\u00e9 Guitar\n* The Amber clock\n\n==== Former monuments ====\n* Monument to [[Imants Sudmalis]] \u2013 1978 (partially dismantled and relocated)\n* Monument to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] \u2013 1970 (dismantled)\n* Monument to [[Nelson Stepanyan]] (relocated to [[Kaliningrad]])\n* Monument to the 11 sailors of [[Soviet submarine L-3]] (relocated to Moscow)\n* Monument to the submariners of the Baltic Sea (partially dismantled)\n\n=== Museums ===\n* The [[Liep\u0101ja Museum]]<ref name=\"museum\"/>\n* Department of Liepaja Museum \"Liepaja during the occupational regimes\"\n* Museum \"History of Liep\u0101ja Community of Jews\"\n* Museum \"Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs\" (founded in 2007)\n* Museum \"Karosta Prison\"<ref name=\"karosta\"/>\n\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== Churches ===\n* [[St. Paul]]'s Baptist Church (1895)\n* [[St. Anna]]'s Lutheran Church (1587)\n* [[Liep\u0101ja Holy Trinity Lutheran Cathedral]] (1758)\n* [[St. Joseph]]'s Catholic Cathedral (1762)\n* [[Holy Trinity]] Orthodox Church (1867)\n* [[St Nicholas Naval Cathedral, Karosta]] (1901\u20131903)\n* [[Saint Meinhard|St. Meinhard]]'s church\n\n=== Notable buildings ===\n* Rose square ({{lang-lv|Ro\u017eu laukums}})\n* Swan Pond (remnant of river L\u012bva)\n* Hotel \"Libava\"\n* Peter The Great house \u2013 the oldest house in Liep\u0101ja\n* Graudu 45 \u2013 Graudu nams ([[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]])\n* Graudu 42 \u2013 former \"Bonic Caf\u00e9\"\n* [[Great Amber Concert Hall]] ({{lang-lv|Koncertz\u0101le \"Lielais dzintars\"}})\n* P\u0113tertirgus \u2013 Central market\n* [[Liep\u0101jas teatris]]\n* City council building \u2013 former District court\n* Restaurant \"Vecais Kapteins\"\n* [[University of Liep\u0101ja]] building\n* 1st Latvian Rock Caf\u00e9\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Mirdzas Kempes iela - galapunkts (1).JPG|thumbnail|right|Public transport in Liep\u0101ja]]\nThe urban transport network of Liep\u0101ja relies mainly on buses and [[minibus|minicoaches]]. {{As of|2009}} there are 12 bus routes and 5 minibus routes in Liep\u0101ja. The city also has a single two-way {{convert|6.9|km|1|abbr=off|adj=mid|-long}} tram line running through some parts of the city from north-east to south-west, which also provides a vital transport link. The tram line was founded after the opening of the first Liep\u0101ja power plant in 1899, which makes it the oldest electric tram line in the Baltic states; it is now operated by the municipal company [[Liep\u0101jas tramvajs]]. The [[Port of Liep\u0101ja]] has a wide water area and consists of three main parts. The Winter harbor is located in the Trade channel and serves small local fishing vessels as well as medium cargo ships. Immediately north of the Trade channel is the main area of the port, separated from the open sea by a line of [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]s. This part of the port can accommodate large ships and ferries. Further north is Karosta harbor, also called Karosta channel, which was formerly a military harbor but is now used for ship repairs and other commercial purposes. Liep\u0101ja also welcomes [[yacht]]s and other leisure vessels which can enter the Trade channel and moor almost in the center of the city. Liep\u0101ja has a railway connection to [[Jelgava]] and [[Riga]] and through them to the rest of Latvia's railway network. There is just one passenger station in the New town, but the railway extends further and links to the port. There is also a northward railway track leading to [[Ventspils]], but in recent decades it has fallen into disuse for economic reasons. The railway provides the main means of delivering cargo to the port. Two main highways, the [[List of National Roads in Latvia|A9 and A11]], connect the city and its port to the rest of the country. The A9 leads north-west towards [[Riga]] and central Latvia and the A11 leads south to the border with [[Lithuania]] and its only port [[Klaip\u0117da]] and to [[Palanga International Airport]]. The city also hosts [[Liep\u0101ja International Airport]], one of three international airports in Latvia; it is located outside the city limits, north of the Lake of Liep\u0101ja near [[Cimdenieki]]. The airport is serviced by charter flights and an [[Air Baltic]] connection to [[Riga International Airport]].\n\n== Communications ==\nCommunication systems in Liep\u0101ja are well-developed. The city is connected to the global Internet by three optical lines owned by [[Lattelecom]], [[TeliaSonera International Carrier]]<ref name=\"kur23102001\"/> and [[Latvenergo]] and a radio relay line owned by [[LVRTC]]. There are four Lattelecom telephone exchanges and the [[LVRTC]] TV station and tower, which transmits four national TV channels, two local TV channels \u2014 \"[[TV Dzintare]]\" and \"[[TV Kurzeme]]\" and six radio stations. It has two local cable TV operators with a total number of subscribers about 15000 and three local [[Internet service providers|ISPs]].

It is the largest city in the [[Kurzeme Planning Region|Kurzeme Region]] and the third largest city in the country after [[Riga]] and [[Daugavpils]]. It is an important [[ice-free port]]. In 2017 population of Liep\u0101ja is 69,443 people.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th century it was a favourite place for sea-bathers with the town boasting a fine park and many pretty gardens, and a theatre.<ref>Murray, 1875, p.85.</ref> Liep\u0101ja is however known throughout Latvia as \"City where the wind is born\", likely because of the constant sea breeze. A song of the same name ({{lang-lv|\"Pils\u0113t\u0101, kur\u0101 piedzimst v\u0113j\u0161\"}}) was composed by [[Imants Kalni\u0146\u0161]] and has become the anthem of the city. Its reputation as the windiest city in Latvia was strengthened with the construction of the largest [[wind farm]] in the nation (33 [[Enercon]] wind turbines) nearby.\n\nThe coat of arms of Liep\u0101ja was adopted four days after the jurisdiction gained [[city rights]] on 18 March 1625.<ref name=\"siteliepaja\"/> These are described as: \"on a silver background, the lion of [[Courland]] with a divided tail, who leans upon a [[tilia|linden]] ({{lang-lv|Liepa}}) tree with its forelegs\". The flag of Liep\u0101ja has the coat of arms in the center, with red in the top half and green in the bottom.<ref name=\"siteliepaja\"/>\n\nOne of the very few surviving films documenting the mass murder of Jews shot into pits at the first stages of the Holocaust is a short film by a German soldier who witnessed the massacre of Liep\u0101ja Jews in July 1941 near the lighthouse.<ref name=\"dochol\" />  \n\n=={{anchor|Names and toponymy}}Names and toponymy==\n{{see also|Names of Liep\u0101ja in different languages|}}\n\nIt is said{{by whom|date=April 2017}} that the first settlement at the location of modern Liep\u0101ja was known by the name ''L\u012bva'' from the name of the river [[L\u012bva (river)|L\u012bva]] on which Liep\u0101ja was located. The name was derived from the [[Livonian language|Livonian]] word ''Liiv'' meaning \"sand\". The oldest written text mentioning L\u012bva village (''Villa Liva'') is the treaty of [[Bishopric of Courland|bishop of Courland]] and the master of the [[Livonian Order]] dated 4 April 1253. In 1263, the [[Teutonic Order]] established a town which they called ''Libau'' in [[German language|German]]. The Latvian name ''Liep\u0101ja'' was mentioned for the first time in 1649 by [[Paul Einhorn]] in his work ''[[Historia Lettica]]''. A [[Russian language|Russian]] name from the time of the [[Russian Empire]] was {{lang|ru|\u041b\u0438\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430}}<ref name=\"KNAB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eki.ee/knab/p_mm_en.htm |title=KNAB, the Place Names Database of EKI |publisher=Eki.ee |accessdate=20 April 2017}}</ref> (''Libava'') or {{lang|ru|\u041b\u0438\u0431\u0430\u0443}} (''Libau''), although {{lang|ru|\u041b\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0430\u044f}} (''Liepaya''), a transliteration of Liep\u0101ja, has been used since World War II.\n\nSome other names for the city include ''Liepoja'' in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]],<ref name=\"KNAB\"/> ''Lipawa'' in [[Polish language|Polish]]<ref name=\"KNAB\"/> and {{lang|yi|\u05dc\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0\u05b7\u05f0\u05e2|rtl=yes}} (''Libaveh'') in [[Yiddish]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nIt is said{{by whom|date=April 2017}} that the original settlement at the location of modern Liep\u0101ja was founded by [[Curonians|Curonian]] fishermen from [[Piemare]] as ''L\u012bva'', but Henry (Henricus Lettus) of [[Livonia]], in his famous ''Chronicle'', makes no mention of the settlement. The [[Teutonic Order]] established a town which they called ''Libau'' here in 1263, followed by [[Jelgava|Mitau]] two years later. In 1418 the village was sacked and burned by the [[Lithuanians]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}<ref>Turnbull, Stephen, ''Tannenberg 1410'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford UK, 2003, p.82: Certainly Poland & Lithuania invaded Prussia again in 1422, but no mentions of Libau.</ref>\n\n===Livonian confederation===\nDuring the 15th century, a part of the trade route from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Moscow]] passed through L\u012bva, where it was known as the \"white road to ''Lyva portus''\". By 1520 the river L\u012bva had become too shallow for easy navigation, and development of the city declined.\n\n=== Duchy of Courland and Semigallia ===\nIn 1560, [[Gotthard Kettler]] loaned all the Grobi\u0146a district, including Libau, to [[Albert, Duke of Prussia]] for 50,000 [[Rhenish guilder|gulden]]s. Only in 1609 after the marriage of [[Sofie Hohenzollern]], Princess of Prussia, to [[Wilhelm Kettler]] did the territory return to the Duchy. During the [[Livonian War]], Libau was attacked and burnt by the Swedes.\n\nIn 1625, Duke [[Friedrich Kettler]] of [[Courland]] granted the town city rights, which were affirmed by King [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]] of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] in 1626, although under what legal authority Sigismund had is debatable. Under Duke [[Jacob Kettler]] (1642\u20131681), Libau became one of the main ports of Courland as it reached the height of its prosperity. In 1637 [[Couronian colonization]] was started from the ports of Libau and [[Ventspils]] (Windau). Kettler was an eager proponent of mercantilist ideas. Metalworking and ship building became much more developed, and trading relations developed not only with nearby countries, but also with Britain, France, the Netherlands and Portugal.\n\nIn 1697\u20131703 a canal was cut to the sea and a more modern port was built.<ref name=\"BSE\"/> In 1701, during the [[Great Northern War]], Libau was captured by [[Charles XII of Sweden]], but by the end of the war, the city had returned to titular Polish possession.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> In 1710 an epidemic of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] killed about a third of the population. In 1780 the first [[Freemasonry]] lodge, \"Libanons,\" was established by Provincial Grand Master [[Ivan Yelagin]] on behalf of the Provincial Lodge of Russia; it was registered as number 524 in the [[Grand Lodge of England]].<ref name=\"masonicum\"/>\n\n=== Russian Empire ===\nCourland passed to the control of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1795 during the third [[Partition of Poland]] and was organized as the [[Courland Governorate]] of Russia. Growth during the nineteenth century was rapid. During the [[Crimean War]], when the British [[Royal Navy]] was blockading Russian Baltic ports, the busy yet still unfortified port of Libau was [[Arthur Cumming (Royal Navy officer)#Crimean War|briefly captured]] on 17 May 1854 without a shot being fired, by a landing party of 110 men from HMS ''Conflict'' and HMS ''Amphion''.<ref name=\"amphion\"/>\n\nIn 1857 an Imperial Decree provided for a new railway to Libau,<ref>Palmer, Alan, ''Northern Shores'', London, 2005, p.215.</ref> and the same year the engineer [[Jan Heidatel]] developed a project to reconstruct the port. In 1861\u20131868 the project was realized \u2013 including the building of a [[Liep\u0101ja Lighthouse|lighthouse]] and breakwaters. Between 1877\u20131882 the political and literary weekly newspaper ''Liep\u0101jas Pastnieks'' was published \u2013 the first [[Latvian language]] newspaper in Libau.<ref name=\"liepajasp\"/> In the 1870s the further rapid development of Russian [[railways]], especially the 1871 opening of the Libava-[[Kaunas]] and the 1876 [[Liep\u0101ja\u2013Romny Railway]]s, ensured that a large proportion of central Russian trade passed through Libau.<ref name=\"BE1\"/> By 1900, 7% of Russian exports were passing through Libau. The city became a major port of the Russian Empire on the Baltic Sea, as well as a popular resort.\n\nOn the orders of [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], Libau was fortified against possible German attacks. [[Libava fortress|Fortifications]] were subsequently built around the city, and in the early 20th century, a major military base was established on the northern edge. It included formidable coastal fortifications and extensive quarters for military personnel. As part of the military development, a separate port was excavated for exclusively military use. This area became known as [[Karosta|Kara Osta]] (War Port) and served military needs throughout the twentieth century.\n\nEarly in the twentieth century, the port of Libau became a central point of embarkation for immigrants traveling to the United States and Canada. By 1906 the direct ship service to the United States was used by 40,000 migrants per year. Simultaneously, the first Russian training school of submarine navigation was founded. In 1912 one of the first water aerodromes in Russia was opened in Libau.<ref name=\"Gse1\"/> In 1913, 1,738 ships entered Libau, with 1,548,119 tonnes of cargo passing through the port. The population had increased from 10,000 to over 100,000 within about 60 years.\n\n=== World War I and War of Independence ===\n[[File:\u041b\u0438\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430 5 \u0440\u0443\u0431 1915 \u0430.jpg|thumb|left|Libau's 5 rubles (1915)]]\nFollowing the outbreak of [[World War I]], the German cruiser SMS ''Magdeburg'' shelled Libau, and other vessels laid mines off the approaches to the port.<ref>Palmer, 2005, p.255</ref> Libau was soon occupied by the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]], on 7 May 1915, and in memory of this event, a monument was constructed on K\u016brm\u0101jas Prospect in 1916 (destroyed by [[Bolsheviks]] in 1919). Libau's local government issued its own money for a while in this period \u2013 ''Libaua rubles''. An advanced German [[Zeppelin]] base was constructed at Vai\u0146ode, near Liep\u0101ja, with five hangars, in August 1915.<ref>Palmer, 2005, p.258.</ref> On 23 October 1915, the German cruiser {{SMS|Prinz Adalbert}} was sunk by the British submarine {{HMS|E8}}, {{convert|37|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Libau.\n\nWith the collapse of Russia and the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], the occupying German forces had a quiet, time but the subsequent collapse of the German Empire and the Allied denunciation of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty changed everything. Independence of the Republic of Latvia was proclaimed on 18 November 1918, and the [[Latvian Provisional Government]] under [[Karlis Ulmanis]] was created. Bolshevik Russia now advanced into Latvian territory and met little resistance here. Soon the Provisional Government and remaining German units were forced to leave [[Riga]] and retreated all the way to Liep\u0101ja, but then the Red offensive stalled along the [[Venta]] river. A Latvian Soviet Republic was announced. Latvia now became the main theatre of Baltic operations for the remaining German forces in 1919. In addition, a ''Landeswehr'' was formed to work in conjunction with the German forces.\n\nIn Liep\u0101ja, a coup organized by Germans took place on 16 April 1919 and Ulmanis government was forced to flee and was replaced by [[Andrievs Niedra]].<ref name=\"\u0160ili\u0146\u0161\">{{cite news |last1=\u0160ili\u0146\u0161 |first1=J\u0101nis |title=The republic on the sea: The 1919 coup that exiled the Latvian government to a steamboat |url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/culture/history/the-republic-on-the-sea-the-1919-coup-that-exiled-the-latvian-government-to-a-steamboat.a316422/ |accessdate=21 April 2019 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]] |date=18 April 2019}}</ref> The Ulmanis government found shelter on the steamship \"Saratov\" in Liep\u0101ja port.

However, when a Riga branch of the bank was opened, the business centre of gravity shifted from Liep\u0101ja so that by 1923 its Riga 'branch' was responsible for 90% of the turnover. The German consul in Liep\u0101ja reported at the time that \"Riga, the economic heart of the country, draws all business to itself.\" The Latvian government ignored the pleas of the Libau Exchange Association to frustrate this.<ref>Hiden, John, ''The Baltic States and Weimar Ostpolitik'', Cambridge University Press, UK, 1987, p.101-3.</ref> In 1935 KOD ({{lang-lv|Kara ostas darbn\u012bcas}}) started to manufacture the light aircraft [[KOD-1]] and [[KOD-2]] at Liep\u0101ja.

He signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact]] in part to gain control of this territory. When the Soviet Union [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|occupied and annexed Latvia in 1940]], it nationalized private property. Many thousands of former owners were arrested and [[June deportation|deported]] to the gulag camps in [[Siberia]].\n\nIn 1941 Liep\u0101ja was among the first cities captured by the [[291st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|291st Infantry Division]] of [[Army Group North]] after Nazi Germany began [[Operation Barbarossa]], its war against the Soviet Union. German Nazis and Latvian collaborators virtually [[Liep\u0101ja massacres|exterminated]] the local Jewish population, which had numbered about 7,000 before the war. Film footage of an [[Einsatzgruppen]] execution of local Jews was taken in Liep\u0101ja.<ref name=\"filmabouthol\"/><ref name=\"dochol\"/> Most of these mass murders took place in the dunes of [[\u0160\u0137\u0113de]] north of the city. Fewer than thirty Jews survived in Liep\u0101ja by the end of the war.\n\nDuring the war, the German navy's U-boat crews received their torpedo training at Liep\u0101ja.\n\nDuring the period 1944\u20131945, as the Soviet Union began its offensive to the Baltic Sea, Liep\u0101ja was within the \"[[Courland Pocket]]\". It was occupied by the [[Red Army]] on 9 May 1945. Thousands of Latvians fled as refugees to Germany. The city had been devastated during the war, and most of the buildings and industrial plant were destroyed.\n\n=== Latvian SSR ===\nOn 25\u201329 March 1949, the Soviet Union organized a second [[Operation Priboi|mass deportation]] to [[Siberia]] from Liep\u0101ja. In 1950 a monument to Stalin was erected on Station square ({{lang-lv|Stacijas laukums}}). It was dismantled in 1958 after the Party Congress that discussed his abuses.\n\nDuring 1953\u20131957 the city center was reconstructed under the direction of architects A. Kruglov and M. \u017dagare.<ref name=\"BSE\"/> In 1952\u20131955 the [[University of Liep\u0101ja|Liep\u0101ja Academy of Pedagogy]] building was constructed under the direction of A. Aivars. In 1960 the ''Kurzeme'' shopping centre was opened. During the Soviet administration, Liep\u0101ja was a [[closed city]]; even local farmers and villagers needed a special permit to enter it.\n\nThe Soviet military set up its Baltic naval base and [[nuclear weapon]] warehouses there; The Beberli\u0146\u0161 [[sandpit]] was dug out to extract sand used for constructing underground warehouses. In 1967 the Soviets completely closed the port to commercial traffic. One third of the city was taken up with a Soviet naval base; its military staff numbered 26,000. The 14th Submarine Squadron of the USSR's [[Baltic Fleet]] (''{{lang-ru|link=no|14 \u044d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043b\u044c\u044f \u041b\u0438\u0412\u041c\u0411 \u0414\u041a\u0411\u0424}}'', call sign \"\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\") was stationed there with 16 submarines (Types: [[Whiskey class submarine|613]], [[Golf class submarine|629a]], [[Juliett class submarine|651]]); as was the 6th group of Rear Supply of the Baltic Fleet, and the 81st Design Bureau and Reserve Command Center of the same force.\n\nIn 1977 Liep\u0101ja was awarded the [[Order of the October Revolution]] for heroic defense against Nazi Germany in 1941. Five residents were awarded the honorary title [[Hero of Socialist Labor]]: Anatolijs Filatkins, Art\u016brs Fridrihsons, Voldem\u0101rs Lazdups, Valentins \u0160uvajevs and Ot\u012blija \u017dagata. Because of the rapid growth of the city's population, a shortage of apartment houses resulted. To resolve this, the Soviet government organized development of most of the modern Liep\u0101ja districts: [[Dienvidrietumi (Liep\u0101ja)|Dienvidrietumi]], [[Ezerkrasts]], [[Zieme\u013cu priek\u0161pils\u0113ta (Liep\u0101ja)|Zieme\u013cu priek\u0161pils\u0113ta]], [[Za\u013c\u0101 birze]] and [[Tosmare]]. The majority of these blocks were constructed of ferro-concrete panels in standard projects designed by the state [[Latgyprogorstroy]] Institute (''{{lang-ru|link=no|\u041b\u0430\u0442\u0433\u0438\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439}}''). In 1986 the new central city hospital in [[Za\u013ca birze]] was opened.<ref name=\"slimnica\"/> \n[[File:Soviet blocks, Liepaja.jpg|thumbnail|right|Soviet-era apartment blocks in Liep\u0101ja]]\n\n=== 1990\u2013present ===\nAfter Latvia regained independence after the fall of the Soviet Union, Liep\u0101ja has worked hard to change from a military city into a modern port city (again appearing on European maps after the secrecy of the Soviet period). The commercial port was re-opened in 1991, and in 1994 the last [[Russian Federation|Russian]] troops left Liep\u0101ja. Since then, Liep\u0101ja has engaged in international co-operation, has been associated with 10 twin and partner cities, and is an active partner in several co-operation networks. Facilities are being improved. The city is the location of Latvia's largest [[Military of Latvia|naval flotilla]], the largest warehouses of [[ammunition]] and weapons in the Baltic states, and the main supply centre of the Latvian army.\n\nThe former closed military town has been transformed into the northern neighbourhood of [[Karosta]], occupying a third of the area of the city of Liep\u0101ja and attracting tourists to the remaints of the military era.<ref>[https://www.latvia.travel/en/sight/liepaja-naval-port Liep\u0101ja Naval Port]</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, many ambitious construction projects were planned for the city, including a [[NATO]] military base, and Baltic Sea Park, planned as the biggest amusement park in the [[Baltic states]]. Most of the projects have not yet been realised due to economic and political factors. Liep\u0101ja's heating network was renovated with the cooperation of French and Russian companies: [[Veolia Energy-Dalkia|Dalkia]] and [[Gazprom]], respectively. In 2006, Queen [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]], a direct descendant of [[Jacob Kettler]] visited Liep\u0101ja. In 2010 the coal [[cogeneration]] 400 MW power plant was built in Liep\u0101ja with the support of the government.\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Liepaja LVA climate.svg|right|Liepaja's temperature and precipitation distribution]]\n\nLiep\u0101ja enjoys a semi-continental climate noted as \"Dfb\" in the K\u00f6ppen classification. The major factor influencing the weather in the region is the [[Baltic Sea]], providing a relatively mild winter for its high latitude (although snowy) and a relatively cool summer. During the winter the sea around Liep\u0101ja is virtually ice-free. Although occasionally some [[land-fast ice]] may develop, it seldom reaches a hundred meters from the shore and does not last long before melting. The sea warms up fully only in the beginning of August, so the best bathing season in Liep\u0101ja is from August to September. Summers are more affected by the maritime climate than east-facing cities on similar latitudes in opposite [[Sweden]], but winters are milder than inland areas to the east. Regular meteorological observations in the city have been conducted from 1857.\n\n* Average temperatures:\n: February: {{convert|-3.1|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}\n: July: {{convert|16.0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}\n\n* Absolute minimum of temperature: {{convert|-33|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}\n* Absolute maximum of temperature: {{convert|34|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}\n* Number of sunny days per year: 196\n* Average speed of wind: 5.8 [[metre per second|m/s]] (13&nbsp;mph)\n* Average annual norm of precipitation (mostly rain): {{convert|692|mm|1|abbr=on}} \n* Typical wind directions: in the winter \u2013 southern, in the summer \u2013 western.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Liepaja (1981\u20132010 temp and precipitation, 1961\u20131990 sun, humidity)\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 7.9\n|Feb record high C = 15.5\n|Mar record high C = 17.8\n|Apr record high C = 24.5\n|May record high C = 30.0\n|Jun record high C = 32.7\n|Jul record high C = 33.7\n|Aug record high C = 33.6\n|Sep record high C = 30.7\n|Oct record high C = 22.2\n|Nov record high C = 15.4\n|Dec record high C = 10.1\n|year record high C = 33.7\n|Jan high C = 0.8\n|Feb high C = 0.7\n|Mar high C = 3.8\n|Apr high C = 9.8\n|May high C = 15.3\n|Jun high C = 17.9\n|Jul high C = 21.0\n|Aug high C = 21.0\n|Sep high C = 16.5\n|Oct high C = 11.3\n|Nov high C = 5.6\n|Dec high C = 2.3\n|year high C = 10.5\n|Jan mean C = -1.3\n|Feb mean C = -1.7\n|Mar mean C = 1.0\n|Apr mean C = 6.0\n|May mean C = 11.2\n|Jun mean C = 14.3\n|Jul mean C = 17.4\n|Aug mean C = 17.4\n|Sep mean C = 13.2\n|Oct mean C = 8.6\n|Nov mean C = 3.6\n|Dec mean C = 0.3\n|year mean C = 7.6\n|Jan low C = -3.3\n|Feb low C = -4.1\n|Mar low C = -1.9\n|Apr low C = 2.2\n|May low C = 7.0\n|Jun low C = 10.7\n|Jul low C = 13.8\n|Aug low C = 13.7\n|Sep low C = 9.9\n|Oct low C = 5.9\n|Nov low C = 1.5\n|Dec low C = -1.8\n|year low C = 4.5\n|Jan record low C = -32.9\n|Feb record low C = -31.6\n|Mar record low C = -23.8\n|Apr record low C = -10.1\n|May record low C = -4.3\n|Jun record low C = 0.5\n|Jul record low C = 4.8\n|Aug record low C = 4.6\n|Sep record low C = -1.7\n|Oct record low C = -7.3\n|Nov record low C = -17.5\n|Dec record low C = -25.8\n|year record low C = -32.9\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 58.5\n|Feb precipitation mm = 42.2\n|Mar precipitation mm = 46.5\n|Apr precipitation mm = 43.0\n|May precipitation mm = 41.2\n|Jun precipitation mm = 56.0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 72.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 77.9\n|Sep precipitation mm = 81.9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 89.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 87.8\n|Dec precipitation mm = 73.7\n|year precipitation mm = 762.9\n|Jan precipitation days = 13.7\n|Feb precipitation days = 9.9\n|Mar precipitation days = 10.6\n|Apr precipitation days = 7.1\n|May precipitation days = 6.9\n|Jun precipitation days = 8.3\n|Jul precipitation days = 8.8\n|Aug precipitation days = 10.0\n|Sep precipitation days = 12.0\n|Oct precipitation days = 13.8\n|Nov precipitation days = 15.6\n|Dec precipitation days = 14.5\n|year precipitation days = 130.1\n|Jan humidity = 87.2\n|Feb humidity = 85.8\n|Mar humidity = 82.8\n|Apr humidity = 76.3\n|May humidity = 75.7\n|Jun humidity = 77.4\n|Jul humidity = 78.9\n|Aug humidity = 78.5\n|Sep humidity = 80.5\n|Oct humidity = 82.9\n|Nov humidity = 87.4\n|Dec humidity = 86.9\n|year humidity = 81.7\n|Jan sun = 34\n|Feb sun = 64\n|Mar sun = 130\n|Apr sun = 187\n|May sun = 273\n|Jun sun = 295\n|Jul sun = 279\n|Aug sun = 248\n|Sep sun = 173\n|Oct sun = 103\n|Nov sun = 43\n|Dec sun = 28\n|year sun = 1857\n|source 1 = [[NOAA]] (sun 1961\u20131990)<ref name = HKO>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_VI/LV/26406.TXT\n| title = Liepaja Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n| accessdate = 28 November 2013}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Weatherbase (precipitation, humidity, extremes)<ref name = weatherbase>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=264060\n| title = Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Griuzupe, Latvia\n| publisher = Weatherbase\n| accessdate = 4 February 2013}}</ref> Source #3: M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat<ref>{{cite web\n| url= http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/listenormale-1981-2010-1-p125.php\n| title= Liepaja Climate Normals 1981\u20132010\n| publisher= M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat\n| accessdate= 11 October 2017}}</ref>\n|date=November 2011\n}}\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Liepaja-Beach.jpg|thumbnail|right|Beach in Liep\u0101ja]]\nLiep\u0101ja is situated on the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] in the south-western part of Latvia. The westernmost geographical point of Latvia is located approximately {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south thus making Liep\u0101ja Latvia's furthest west city. Liep\u0101ja is situated between the Baltic Sea and [[Liep\u0101ja Lake]] with residential and industrial areas spreading north of the lake. The Trade Channel ({{lang|lv|Tirdzniec\u012bbas kan\u0101ls}}) connects the lake to the sea dividing the city into southern and northern parts, which are often referred to as the Old Town ({{lang|lv|Vecliep\u0101ja}}) and the New Town ({{lang|lv|Jaunliep\u0101ja}}) respectively. The city center is located in the southern part and, although called the Old Town, is relatively more developed. Most of the administrative and cultural buildings are found here as well as the main leisure areas. Along the coast the city extends northwards until it reaches the [[Karosta]] Channel ({{lang|lv|Karostas kan\u0101ls}}). North of the Karosta Channel is an area called [[Karosta]] which is now fully integrated into Liep\u0101ja and is the northernmost district of the city. Liep\u0101ja's coastline consists of an unbroken sandy beach and dunes as does most of Latvia's coastline. The beach of Liep\u0101ja is not as exploited as other places (e.g. the [[Gulf of Riga]], [[J\u016brmala]] and [[P\u00e4rnu]] in Estonia) but also lacks the tourist infrastructure needed for a fashionable, modern resort.\n\n=== J\u016brmala Park ===\n\nJ\u016brmala Park (Seaside Park) is located in the western part of the city at the seaside. The park is {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} long with a total area of 70 ha and is one of the largest planted parks in Latvia. It was developed at the end of the 19th century.\nAt the end of Peldu Street are Latvia's largest drums \u2013 one of the objects of Liep\u0101ja's environmental design which reminds one that Liep\u0101ja is the music capital of Latvia.\nThe open-air concert stage P\u016bt, v\u0113ji\u0146i! (Blow, wind, blow!) was built in 1964. It has been the venue for a good many concerts and festivals, with the festival \"Liep\u0101jas Dzintars\" (\"Amber of Liep\u0101ja\") being the most famous among them, as it could be regarded as the oldest rock festival of the former Soviet Union. It was held for the first time in 1968.\nAlongside the stage is an interesting building, the former Bath House built in 1902 and designed by Max Paul Bertschy. At the beginning of the 19th century Liep\u0101ja was a renowned health resort and the Russian tsar and his family had been visiting Liep\u0101ja. This all encouraged other aristocrats from Russia and Europe to spend their summers in Liep\u0101ja as well.\n\n=== Libava fortress ===\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, [[Libava fortress]] was the most expensive and ambitious project of the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]] on the Baltic Sea. The massive concrete fortifications with eight cannon batteries was built to protect the city and its population from German attacks. The fortress' secret underground passages figure heavily in the city's most famous [[urban legend]]s.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== Districts ===\n# [[Vecliep\u0101ja]]\n# [[Ezerkrasts]]\n# [[Dienvidrietumu rajons (Liep\u0101ja)|Dienvidrietumu rajons]]\n# [[Zieme\u013cu priek\u0161pils\u0113ta (Liep\u0101ja)|Zieme\u013cu priek\u0161pils\u0113ta]]\n# [[Jaunliep\u0101ja]]\n# [[Velnciems]]\n# [[Karosta]]\n# [[Tosmare]]\n# [[Za\u013c\u0101 birze]]\n# [[Jauna Pasaule (Liep\u0101ja)|Jauna Pasaule]]\n\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== Suburbs ===\n# [[Aucugals]]\n# [[Gr\u012bnvalti]]\n# [[P\u0113rkone]]\n# [[Cimdenieki]]\n# [[Kaps\u0113de]]\n# [[\u0160\u0137\u0113de]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n=== Closest cities ===\n\nThe closest city to Liep\u0101ja is [[Grobi\u0146a]], located about {{convert|10|km|mi}} away towards [[Riga]]. Other main cities in the region are [[Klaip\u0117da]] (approx. {{convert|110|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south), [[Ventspils]] (approx. {{convert|115|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and [[Saldus]] (approx. {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east). The distance to Riga (the capital of Latvia) is about {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east. The nearest point to Liep\u0101ja across the Baltic sea is the [[Sweden|Swedish]] island of [[Gotland]] approximately {{convert|160|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north-west.

The city also has a single two-way {{convert|6.9|km|1|abbr=off|adj=mid|-long}} tram line running through some parts of the city from north-east to south-west, which also provides a vital transport link. The tram line was founded after the opening of the first Liep\u0101ja power plant in 1899, which makes it the oldest electric tram line in the Baltic states; it is now operated by the municipal company [[Liep\u0101jas tramvajs]]. The [[Port of Liep\u0101ja]] has a wide water area and consists of three main parts. The Winter harbor is located in the Trade channel and serves small local fishing vessels as well as medium cargo ships. Immediately north of the Trade channel is the main area of the port, separated from the open sea by a line of [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]s. This part of the port can accommodate large ships and ferries. Further north is Karosta harbor, also called Karosta channel, which was formerly a military harbor but is now used for ship repairs and other commercial purposes. Liep\u0101ja also welcomes [[yacht]]s and other leisure vessels which can enter the Trade channel and moor almost in the center of the city. Liep\u0101ja has a railway connection to [[Jelgava]] and [[Riga]] and through them to the rest of Latvia's railway network. There is just one passenger station in the New town, but the railway extends further and links to the port. There is also a northward railway track leading to [[Ventspils]], but in recent decades it has fallen into disuse for economic reasons. The railway provides the main means of delivering cargo to the port. Two main highways, the [[List of National Roads in Latvia|A9 and A11]], connect the city and its port to the rest of the country. The A9 leads north-west towards [[Riga]] and central Latvia and the A11 leads south to the border with [[Lithuania]] and its only port [[Klaip\u0117da]] and to [[Palanga International Airport]]. The city also hosts [[Liep\u0101ja International Airport]], one of three international airports in Latvia; it is located outside the city limits, north of the Lake of Liep\u0101ja near [[Cimdenieki]]. The airport is serviced by charter flights and an [[Air Baltic]] connection to [[Riga International Airport]].\n\n== Communications ==\nCommunication systems in Liep\u0101ja are well-developed. The city is connected to the global Internet by three optical lines owned by [[Lattelecom]], [[TeliaSonera International Carrier]]<ref name=\"kur23102001\"/> and [[Latvenergo]] and a radio relay line owned by [[LVRTC]]. There are four Lattelecom telephone exchanges and the [[LVRTC]] TV station and tower, which transmits four national TV channels, two local TV channels \u2014 \"[[TV Dzintare]]\" and \"[[TV Kurzeme]]\" and six radio stations. It has two local cable TV operators with a total number of subscribers about 15000 and three local [[Internet service providers|ISPs]]. The city also has its own [[amateur radio]] community<ref name=\"amatieri\"/> and a citywide wireless [[video monitoring]] system. {{As of|2010}}, digital terrestrial television is fully operational; [[mobile television]] and broadband wireless networks are ready for implementation. All four Latvian mobile operators have stable zones of coverage ([[GSM]] 900/1800, [[UMTS]], 2100 [[Code division multiple access|CDMA450]]) and client service centers in Liep\u0101ja. The city also has fourteen post offices as well as [[DHL Express|DHL]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] and [[Deutscher Paket Dienst|DPD]] depots.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Fishers in Liepaja.jpg|thumb|Men fish alongside the Tirdzniec\u012bbas Kan\u0101ls (Trade Canal)]]\nIn the second half of the 20th century under Soviet rule Liep\u0101ja became an industrial city and numerous high technology plants were founded, including:\n\n<blockquote>\n# Mashzavod ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u041c\u0430\u0448\u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434, \u041b\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434}})\n# Liepajselmash ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u041b\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430\u0448}}) \u2013 1954 (now [[Hidrolats]])\n# Sarkanais Metalurgs (now [[Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs (company)|Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs]])\n# SRZ-29 ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u0421\u0420\u0417-29, 29-\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434}}) (now [[Tosmares ku\u0123u b\u016bv\u0113tava]])\n# LBORF ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u041b\u0411\u041e\u0420\u0424, \u041b\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u041e\u043a\u0435\u0430\u043d\u0440\u044b\u0431\u0444\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430}}) \u2013 1964\n# Bolshevik ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u0420\u044b\u0431\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0445\u043e\u0437 \"\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043a\"}}) \u2013 1949 (now [[Kursa (Liep\u0101ja)|Kursa]])\n# Perambulator factory \"Liep\u0101ja\" ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430 \"\u041b\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0430\u044f\"}})\n# Mixed fodder plant ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u041b\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434}})\n# Sugar plant ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u041b\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430}})\n# Match factory \"Baltija\" ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u041b\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430 \"\u0411\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u044f\"}}) \u2013 1957\n# Ferro-concrete constructions plant ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u041b\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 5-\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0439}}) \u2013 1959\n# Oil extraction plant ({{lang-ru|link=no|M\u0430\u0441\u043b\u043e\u044d\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434}})\n# SU-426 of BMGS ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u0421\u0423-426 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u043b\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439}}) (now [[BMGS]])\n# [[Lauma (company)|Lauma]] ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u041b\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0443\u043c\u0430}}) \u2013 1972\n# Linoleum plant\n# Shoes factory\n</blockquote>\n\nAfter collapse of [[Economy of the Soviet Union|USSR's centrally planned economy]], only some of these plants continue to operate.\n\nWithin Latvia Liep\u0101ja is well known mostly by coffee brand ''Liep\u0101jas kafija'',<ref name=\"kafija\"/> beer ''L\u012bvu alus'' and sugar ''Liep\u0101jas cukurs''.\nIn 1997 the [[Liepaja Special Economic Zone]] was established for 20 years providing a low tax environment in order to attract foreign investments and facilitate the economic development of Liep\u0101ja, but investment growth remained slow due to a shortage of skilled labor force.<ref name=\"Eglins-Eglitis\">{{cite journal |last1=Eglins-Eglitis |first1=Atis |last2=Lusena-Ezera |first2=Inese |title=From Industrial City to the Creative City: Development Policy Challenges and Liepaja Case |journal=Procedia Economics and Finance |date=2016 |volume=39 |pages=122\u2013130 |doi=10.1016/S2212-5671(16)30256-8}}</ref> The main industries in Liep\u0101ja are the steel producer [[Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs (company)|Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs]], building firm [[UPB (holding)|UPB]] and the underwear brand [[Lauma (textile firm)|Lauma]].<ref name=\"lur2005\"/> The economy of Liep\u0101ja relies heavily on its port which accepts a wide range of cargo.

His father Alexander Semionovich Russov came from peasants of the Nizhny Novgorod Governorate, his mother Iraida Semionovna Nemtsova was from Kostroma. In 1939, passion for drawing leads Russov to the art studio of the Vyborgsky district of Leningrad, where he is engaged up to the outbreak of war.\n\nIn December 1941, along with his mother he was evacuated from the siege of Leningrad in the [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorky Province]]. Soon he had an accident that could change the fate of the future artist. Under circumstances not completely clear, Rusov lost his right eye. According to the artist's son, this happened from a careless jab of whip. However already 1943, he moved to Kostroma city, where goes to the regional art school.\n\n[[File:\"Tower\" Vyacheslav Ivanov - panoramio.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Tavricheskaya Art School]] Building on Tavricheskaya st, 35]]\n\nIn 1945, in connection with the return to Leningrad Russov was transferred to ''[[Tavricheskaya Art School]]'' (now known as an Art College named after [[Nicholas Roerich]]), from which he graduated in 1947.<ref>''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' St Petersburg, NP-Print, 2007. P.368</ref>\n\nAfter graduation Russov entered the first course of Painting Department of [[Repin Institute of Arts|''Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture namen after Ilya Repin'']], studied of [[Yuri Neprintsev]] and [[Genrikh Pavlovsky]]. However, having studied for two years for health reasons had to leave class. In 1951\u20131955 Russov taught drawing in the secondary schools of Leningrad, while continuing to worked on his painting skills using the experience gained while studying at the Academy.<ref>[https://www.ais-aica.ru/publikatsii/311-2012-07-17-04-00-59/2948-2012-07-12-21-00-19.html ''Sergei V. Ivanov. Riddles early portraits by Lev Russov.'']</ref>\n\nSoon Russov shows his work in [[Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation|Leningrad Union of Artists]] and he is invited to participate in art exhibitions together with leading masters of the fine arts of Leningrad. At the Spring Art Exhibitions of 1954 and 1955, he presented works ''A Girl with a Bow''<ref>[[Spring exhibition (Leningrad, 1954)|''The Spring Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1954.

In addition to portraits, Russov during these years painted genre compositions, still lifes, landscapes, worked in the technique of oil painting, watercolors and woodcuts.\n\nThe year 1955 was marked for Russov by meetings with people who changed his personal and creative destiny. He meets Ekaterina Vasilievna Balebina (born December 29, 1933, the daughter of Vasily Balebin, the famous torpedo bomber, [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]), who will soon become his wife, the mother of his son Andrei and the main muse. Charming and lively, full of self-sacrifice, she will serve for Russov as a model for many paintings and portraits, create and protect the world in which the artist's creative gift will unfold and sparkle in full strong.\n\nIn the same year, Lev Russov met with [[Yevgeny Mravinsky]], their relationship grew into a long-years friendship, to which we owe several portraits of the outstanding conductor, created during 1950-1980s.\n\nIn 1960\u20131980 Russov creative life was divided between the Leningrad art studio, the home in Fonarny Lane and the village of Pavshino on the Oredezh River, where on the high bank of the river he built a cottage with a workshop and worked many months each year.\n\nLev Alexsandrovich Russov died on February 20, 1987 in Leningrad in the sixty-second year of his life from heart disease. His works reside in museums and private collections in Russia, USA, Norway, Great Britain, Sweden, France and other countries. The widow of the artist Ekaterina Vasilievna Russov outlived her husband by 15 years and died on June 20, 2002 in St. Petersburg at the sixty-ninth year of life.\n\nIn 1970, at the [[Ioffe Institute|Leningrad Physical-Technical Institute named after A.F. Ioffe]], [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]], it consisted of the only lifetime exhibition of Russov's works\n\n== Creativity ==\n\nThe creative life of Lev Russov, unusual and contradictory, contained two periods of unequal length and significance, one of which was devoted to painting, and the other mainly to wooden sculpture.\n\n=== Portrait ===\n\nAccording to the researchers of the artist's creativity, with the full strength Russov's pictorial talent was revealed in a series of portraits of his contemporaries painted in the 1950s and the first half of the 1960s, which brought fame and recognition to the author. For ten years, Russov created a gallery of portraits that enriched the various types of modern portraiture. The beginning of it was laid on female images, among which portraits of the wife and young women from the circle of common friends stand out. Among them were ''[[Portrait of Catherine Balebina]]''<ref>''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' St Petersburg, NP-Print, 2007. P.65.</ref><ref>[''The Leningrad School of Painting. Essays on the History''. St Petersburg, ARKA Gallery Publishing, 2019. Plate 40.]</ref> (1956), ''Portrait of Natali Orlova''<ref>''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' St Petersburg, NP-Print, 2007. P.151.</ref> (1956), ''Portrait of Young Woman in Red'' (1956), ''Portrait of Young Woman'' (1957), and others.\n\nThe known art works that continued them in the late 1950s and early 1960s \u2013 ''Portrait of wife'' (1959), ''Fresh Model'' (1961), ''Kira'', ''Narine'', ''Portrait of Maria Korsukova'' (all 1962), is distinguished by great decorativeness, generalization of the drawing and the sharpness of the composition, which Russov used in searching for means of enhancing the expressiveness of the image.\n\nCharacterizing the work of Russov, art historians Anatoli Dmitrenko and Ruslan Bakhtiyarov note:\n\n{{Cquote|''In Leningrad portrait-painting at the turn of the 1960s a certain conflict still persisted between the task of producing a typified image and the simultaneous desire on the part of the artist to touch upon \u201cthe hidden movements of the soul\u201d. It is no coincidence that Lev Russov, who gave unambiguous preference in his work to the latter aspect, separated, as it were, the subject\u2019s inner world from the outward predetermined features of the type that marked many works of portraiture. In his paintings one can trace a connection with the work of Valentin Serov and the manner of Osip Braz and Andreas Zorn. Organically connecting the figure and the background, which he successfully used as a means of heightening the expressiveness of the image, Russov at the same time accords each of his subjects the right to \u201cpersonal space\u201d, as, for example, in the portraits of Ekaterina Balebina, Natalya Orlova or the young country girl Natasha Savelyeva.''<ref>''\u0410natoli F.

P.61-64.</ref> }}\n\n[[File:Russov-Caterina Balebina-7port31b.jpg|thumb|280px|left|[[Portrait of Catherine Balebina]]. 1956]]\n\nTrips in the mid-1950s to Oredezh, first to Nakol village, and then to Pavshino, marked the beginning of a remarkable series of portraits of children and young people. Among them ''Zoya'' (1957), twin portrait of sisters ''Kira and Zoya'' (1958), ''Natasha'' (1958), ''Natasha'', ''Little Bows'' (\u043e\u0431\u0435 1960). In the 1960s, this series of works was supplemented by portraits of the son ''Andrei with the Horse'' (1963), ''Portrait of the Son'' (1965) and others.\n\nThe portraits of this period fall at the time of the highest creative upsurge of Russov as the painter, and constitute the most valuable part of his diverse artistic heritage. They are distinguished by an extraordinary expressiveness of images, courage of compositional decisions, unmistakable artistic taste. The color scheme is dominated by pearl and purple tones. The manner of the artist is distinguished by a powerful pictorial language, wide writing, sharp composition, interest in unexpected rakurs. Rusov possessed a rare ability to capture the fleeting states of model, to quickly embody a pictorial idea on canvas \u2013 immediately and unusually convincingly. The images he created combine the expressiveness of individual characteristics with a vivid embodiment of the typical features of contemporaries.\n\nIn the work on the portrait, Rusov manages to grab the fleeting state of model, which, with prolonged posing, eludes most artists. He knows how to keep this first impression to the end and convey to the viewer. Therefore, in his works, nature is alive, and this feeling of a lively look of living people is almost the most exciting in the artist's portraits.<ref>[https://www.ais-aica.ru/publikatsii/311-2012-07-17-04-00-59/2948-2012-07-12-21-00-19.html ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0421. \u0412.'' \u0417\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430.]</ref>\n\nAlong with the expressiveness of the form, the portraits of Russov are distinguished by the depth and psychologism of the images, careful selection and study of model. Its another important reason for the success of his works. Some of his best works of this period Russov painted in the village of Pavshino on the Oredezh River near Leningrad, where in the late 1950s a group of young artists settled: G. Bagrov, E. Shram, K. Slavin and N. Slavina, L. Kuzov, A. Yakovlev, G. Antonov. Here on the Oredezh river, first in the village of Nakol, then in Pavshino Rusov finds the heroines of her new portraits: Aunt Polya, the sisters Zoya and Kira, the village girl Natasha Savelyeva. It was her portrait, painted by Rusov in 1958, for the first time that was truly noticed and appreciated by critics.\n\nIn critical reviews of the Fall Art Exhibition of 1958, Leningrad newspapers gave this portrait a prominent place. E.

Choosing a theme and its figurative embodiment echoed the mood of the [[Khrushchev Thaw|''Khrushchev \"Thaw'']] and personal freedom-loving aspirations of the author. Shown at the end of 1956 at the Autumn exhibition of Leningrad artists works ''A Birth'', ''On Tortures'', ''A Death of father'', ''On the Fields of the Motherland'', ''A Boarding (Insurgent Flandria)'', ''Till and Lamme'', ''Death to traitors'', ''Song by Till'' (all 1956), first brought the author fame and claimed him as a master of historical painting.<ref>[[Autumn exhibition (Leningrad, 1956)|''The Fall Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1956.

St Petersburg, ARKA Gallery Publishing, 2019. Plate 195.</ref> are also interesting in that the artist gave Thill features a close resemblance to the author. This makes it unique in the creative legacy of the artist as self-portraits of Lev Russov are unknown. As a child he lost one eye and did not like to be photographed and a general refusal to pose for portraits, painted by himself or others.\n\nIn the future, Russov's interest in historical topics was expressed in numerous works of wooden sculpture, as well as in a some paintings, in particular in the painting ''Strolling Buffoons'' (1976).\n\n=== Still-Life ===\n\n[[File:Russov-Still-Life with Seneka-rus01b.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Still-Life with Seneca. 1963]]\n\nStill-life in the works of Russov is closely connected with the colorful and compositional tasks that the artist set for himself in the work on the portrait. Hence the sharpness and freshness of compositional solutions, the internal dramatic and tension in his works of this genre. It is no coincidence that, in terms of expressiveness and depth of images, the best works by Russov in the still life genre are not inferior to his well-known portraits. This sets them apart from others paintings created in this genre in 1950\u20131970.\n\nMost of his still lifes convey not only the interior of the artist's workshop and the object world surrounding him, but also the atmosphere, the flour of creativity in which the creator's ideas are born and implemented. Moreover, their art form, despite the apparent ease of execution, is thought out and brought to perfection by the author. Among Russov's works in this genre, sources distinguish ''Still-Life with Seneca''<ref>''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0421. \u041d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c. \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430.'' \u0421\u041f\u0431, \u041d\u041f-\u041f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0442, 2007. \u0421.22. {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}</ref> (1963), ''Still-Life with Bouquet''<ref>''The Leningrad School of Painting.

However, for the general public and even for many colleagues in the Leningrad Union of Artists, he remained virtually unknown. The explanation for this must be sought primarily in the character traits of the artist. A man of independent views, talented, direct, sometimes ruthless in assessments and judgments,  astonishing those who knew him closely with his monstrous capacity for work, he eschewed the public life of the Union of Artists, was intolerant of any manifestations of mediocrity and imitation of creativity. In fact, during the Brezhnev years of stagnation and developed socialism he remained a man of the Khrushchev's thaw. In 1970\u20131980 Russov rarely showed his work at art exhibitions. His life was divided between a city workshop, a house in Pavshino on Oredezh and communication with a narrow circle of old friends. In fairness, we must admit that the existing system did not reject such artists, allowing them to have almost free materials and a workshop for creative work in exchange for minimal loyalty.\n\nIn mid-1960s Lev Russov enjoys wooden sculpture and Russian folk epic. From now until the end of life it becomes the main theme of his work, surpassing the painting. From his hands came out a lot of superb sculptures, from small figurines to large forms, such as ''Russian Icarus'' and the relief on the epic theme of ''Zastava'', ''Folk singers''.\n\n== Family ==\n\n* Wife Ekaterina Vasilievna Balebiba (1933\u20132002);\n* Son Andrei Lvovich Russov (b. 1960).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Portrait of Catherine Balebina]]\n* [[Portrait of Yevgeny Mravinsky]]\n* [[Fine Art of Leningrad]]\n* [[Leningrad School of Painting]]\n* [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Principal exhibitions ==\n* 1954 (Leningrad): [[Spring exhibition (Leningrad, 1954)|''The Spring Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1954'']]\n* 1955 (Leningrad): [[Spring exhibition (Leningrad, 1955)|''The Spring Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1955'']]\n* 1956 (Leningrad): [[Autumn exhibition (Leningrad, 1956)|''The Fall Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1956'']]\n* 1957 (Leningrad): [[Anniversary Art Exhibition (Leningrad, 1957)|''1917\u20131957.

His father Alexander Semionovich Russov came from peasants of the Nizhny Novgorod Governorate, his mother Iraida Semionovna Nemtsova was from Kostroma. In 1939, passion for drawing leads Russov to the art studio of the Vyborgsky district of Leningrad, where he is engaged up to the outbreak of war.\n\nIn December 1941, along with his mother he was evacuated from the siege of Leningrad in the [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorky Province]]. Soon he had an accident that could change the fate of the future artist. Under circumstances not completely clear, Rusov lost his right eye. According to the artist's son, this happened from a careless jab of whip. However already 1943, he moved to Kostroma city, where goes to the regional art school.\n\n[[File:\"Tower\" Vyacheslav Ivanov - panoramio.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Tavricheskaya Art School]] Building on Tavricheskaya st, 35]]\n\nIn 1945, in connection with the return to Leningrad Russov was transferred to ''[[Tavricheskaya Art School]]'' (now known as an Art College named after [[Nicholas Roerich]]), from which he graduated in 1947.<ref>''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' St Petersburg, NP-Print, 2007. P.368</ref>\n\nAfter graduation Russov entered the first course of Painting Department of [[Repin Institute of Arts|''Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture namen after Ilya Repin'']], studied of [[Yuri Neprintsev]] and [[Genrikh Pavlovsky]]. However, having studied for two years for health reasons had to leave class. In 1951\u20131955 Russov taught drawing in the secondary schools of Leningrad, while continuing to worked on his painting skills using the experience gained while studying at the Academy.<ref>[https://www.ais-aica.ru/publikatsii/311-2012-07-17-04-00-59/2948-2012-07-12-21-00-19.html ''Sergei V. Ivanov. Riddles early portraits by Lev Russov.'']</ref>\n\nSoon Russov shows his work in [[Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation|Leningrad Union of Artists]] and he is invited to participate in art exhibitions together with leading masters of the fine arts of Leningrad. At the Spring Art Exhibitions of 1954 and 1955, he presented works ''A Girl with a Bow''<ref>[[Spring exhibition (Leningrad, 1954)|''The Spring Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1954.

In addition to portraits, Russov during these years painted genre compositions, still lifes, landscapes, worked in the technique of oil painting, watercolors and woodcuts.\n\nThe year 1955 was marked for Russov by meetings with people who changed his personal and creative destiny. He meets Ekaterina Vasilievna Balebina (born December 29, 1933, the daughter of Vasily Balebin, the famous torpedo bomber, [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]), who will soon become his wife, the mother of his son Andrei and the main muse. Charming and lively, full of self-sacrifice, she will serve for Russov as a model for many paintings and portraits, create and protect the world in which the artist's creative gift will unfold and sparkle in full strong.\n\nIn the same year, Lev Russov met with [[Yevgeny Mravinsky]], their relationship grew into a long-years friendship, to which we owe several portraits of the outstanding conductor, created during 1950-1980s.\n\nIn 1960\u20131980 Russov creative life was divided between the Leningrad art studio, the home in Fonarny Lane and the village of Pavshino on the Oredezh River, where on the high bank of the river he built a cottage with a workshop and worked many months each year.\n\nLev Alexsandrovich Russov died on February 20, 1987 in Leningrad in the sixty-second year of his life from heart disease. His works reside in museums and private collections in Russia, USA, Norway, Great Britain, Sweden, France and other countries. The widow of the artist Ekaterina Vasilievna Russov outlived her husband by 15 years and died on June 20, 2002 in St. Petersburg at the sixty-ninth year of life.\n\nIn 1970, at the [[Ioffe Institute|Leningrad Physical-Technical Institute named after A.F. Ioffe]], [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]], it consisted of the only lifetime exhibition of Russov's works\n\n== Creativity ==\n\nThe creative life of Lev Russov, unusual and contradictory, contained two periods of unequal length and significance, one of which was devoted to painting, and the other mainly to wooden sculpture.\n\n=== Portrait ===\n\nAccording to the researchers of the artist's creativity, with the full strength Russov's pictorial talent was revealed in a series of portraits of his contemporaries painted in the 1950s and the first half of the 1960s, which brought fame and recognition to the author. For ten years, Russov created a gallery of portraits that enriched the various types of modern portraiture. The beginning of it was laid on female images, among which portraits of the wife and young women from the circle of common friends stand out. Among them were ''[[Portrait of Catherine Balebina]]''<ref>''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' St Petersburg, NP-Print, 2007. P.65.</ref><ref>[''The Leningrad School of Painting. Essays on the History''. St Petersburg, ARKA Gallery Publishing, 2019. Plate 40.]</ref> (1956), ''Portrait of Natali Orlova''<ref>''Sergei V.

P.151.</ref> (1956), ''Portrait of Young Woman in Red'' (1956), ''Portrait of Young Woman'' (1957), and others.\n\nThe known art works that continued them in the late 1950s and early 1960s \u2013 ''Portrait of wife'' (1959), ''Fresh Model'' (1961), ''Kira'', ''Narine'', ''Portrait of Maria Korsukova'' (all 1962), is distinguished by great decorativeness, generalization of the drawing and the sharpness of the composition, which Russov used in searching for means of enhancing the expressiveness of the image.\n\nCharacterizing the work of Russov, art historians Anatoli Dmitrenko and Ruslan Bakhtiyarov note:\n\n{{Cquote|''In Leningrad portrait-painting at the turn of the 1960s a certain conflict still persisted between the task of producing a typified image and the simultaneous desire on the part of the artist to touch upon \u201cthe hidden movements of the soul\u201d. It is no coincidence that Lev Russov, who gave unambiguous preference in his work to the latter aspect, separated, as it were, the subject\u2019s inner world from the outward predetermined features of the type that marked many works of portraiture. In his paintings one can trace a connection with the work of Valentin Serov and the manner of Osip Braz and Andreas Zorn. Organically connecting the figure and the background, which he successfully used as a means of heightening the expressiveness of the image, Russov at the same time accords each of his subjects the right to \u201cpersonal space\u201d, as, for example, in the portraits of Ekaterina Balebina, Natalya Orlova or the young country girl Natasha Savelyeva.''<ref>''\u0410natoli F.

Among them ''Zoya'' (1957), twin portrait of sisters ''Kira and Zoya'' (1958), ''Natasha'' (1958), ''Natasha'', ''Little Bows'' (\u043e\u0431\u0435 1960). In the 1960s, this series of works was supplemented by portraits of the son ''Andrei with the Horse'' (1963), ''Portrait of the Son'' (1965) and others.\n\nThe portraits of this period fall at the time of the highest creative upsurge of Russov as the painter, and constitute the most valuable part of his diverse artistic heritage. They are distinguished by an extraordinary expressiveness of images, courage of compositional decisions, unmistakable artistic taste. The color scheme is dominated by pearl and purple tones. The manner of the artist is distinguished by a powerful pictorial language, wide writing, sharp composition, interest in unexpected rakurs. Rusov possessed a rare ability to capture the fleeting states of model, to quickly embody a pictorial idea on canvas \u2013 immediately and unusually convincingly. The images he created combine the expressiveness of individual characteristics with a vivid embodiment of the typical features of contemporaries.\n\nIn the work on the portrait, Rusov manages to grab the fleeting state of model, which, with prolonged posing, eludes most artists. He knows how to keep this first impression to the end and convey to the viewer. Therefore, in his works, nature is alive, and this feeling of a lively look of living people is almost the most exciting in the artist's portraits.<ref>[https://www.ais-aica.ru/publikatsii/311-2012-07-17-04-00-59/2948-2012-07-12-21-00-19.html ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0421. \u0412.'' \u0417\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430.]</ref>\n\nAlong with the expressiveness of the form, the portraits of Russov are distinguished by the depth and psychologism of the images, careful selection and study of model. Its another important reason for the success of his works. Some of his best works of this period Russov painted in the village of Pavshino on the Oredezh River near Leningrad, where in the late 1950s a group of young artists settled: G. Bagrov, E. Shram, K. Slavin and N. Slavina, L. Kuzov, A. Yakovlev, G. Antonov. Here on the Oredezh river, first in the village of Nakol, then in Pavshino Rusov finds the heroines of her new portraits: Aunt Polya, the sisters Zoya and Kira, the village girl Natasha Savelyeva. It was her portrait, painted by Rusov in 1958, for the first time that was truly noticed and appreciated by critics.\n\nIn critical reviews of the Fall Art Exhibition of 1958, Leningrad newspapers gave this portrait a prominent place. E. Kovtun, in his article ''Notes on an Art Exhibition'' in the newspaper ''Leningrad Evening'' dated November 29, 1958, wrote about  ''the amazing immediacy and freshness of feelings that bribes in this work of L. Russov''.<ref>\u041a\u043e\u0432\u0442\u0443\u043d \u0415. \u0417\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u043e \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0435 // \u0412\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434, 1958, 29 \u043d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f.</ref> M.

These parties, of course, were slightly accompanied by vodka and Prishvin-style stories until late at night.''.<ref>''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0421. \u0412. \u041e \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430.'' // \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438. \u0412\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a 23. \u0421\u041f\u0431., 2012. \u0421.11.</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1970s, Russov turned to the theme of two great contemporaries \u2013 Dmitry Shostakovich and Yevgeny Mravinsky, she found its embodiment in the picture ''The Leningrad Symphony. Conductor Yevgeny Mravinsky'' (1980). Russov worked for a long time on the concept and composition of the picture, rejecting one option after another. It is difficult to judge the extent to which its final version satisfied the artist. It can be assumed that, if he had the strength and time, this work could continue.\n\nFrom the Memoirs of Alexander Mikhailovna Vavilina-Mravinsky, the widow of Yevgeny Mravinsky:\n\n{{Cquote|''Lev Russov had another desirable dream-topic: Mravinsky and Shostakovich, but the disease, lack of life time and energy did not allow to realize it in its final form.

Choosing a theme and its figurative embodiment echoed the mood of the [[Khrushchev Thaw|''Khrushchev \"Thaw'']] and personal freedom-loving aspirations of the author. Shown at the end of 1956 at the Autumn exhibition of Leningrad artists works ''A Birth'', ''On Tortures'', ''A Death of father'', ''On the Fields of the Motherland'', ''A Boarding (Insurgent Flandria)'', ''Till and Lamme'', ''Death to traitors'', ''Song by Till'' (all 1956), first brought the author fame and claimed him as a master of historical painting.<ref>[[Autumn exhibition (Leningrad, 1956)|''The Fall Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1956.

St Petersburg, ARKA Gallery Publishing, 2019. Plate 195.</ref> are also interesting in that the artist gave Thill features a close resemblance to the author. This makes it unique in the creative legacy of the artist as self-portraits of Lev Russov are unknown. As a child he lost one eye and did not like to be photographed and a general refusal to pose for portraits, painted by himself or others.\n\nIn the future, Russov's interest in historical topics was expressed in numerous works of wooden sculpture, as well as in a some paintings, in particular in the painting ''Strolling Buffoons'' (1976).\n\n=== Still-Life ===\n\n[[File:Russov-Still-Life with Seneka-rus01b.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Still-Life with Seneca. 1963]]\n\nStill-life in the works of Russov is closely connected with the colorful and compositional tasks that the artist set for himself in the work on the portrait. Hence the sharpness and freshness of compositional solutions, the internal dramatic and tension in his works of this genre. It is no coincidence that, in terms of expressiveness and depth of images, the best works by Russov in the still life genre are not inferior to his well-known portraits. This sets them apart from others paintings created in this genre in 1950\u20131970.\n\nMost of his still lifes convey not only the interior of the artist's workshop and the object world surrounding him, but also the atmosphere, the flour of creativity in which the creator's ideas are born and implemented. Moreover, their art form, despite the apparent ease of execution, is thought out and brought to perfection by the author. Among Russov's works in this genre, sources distinguish ''Still-Life with Seneca''<ref>''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0421. \u041d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c. \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430.'' \u0421\u041f\u0431, \u041d\u041f-\u041f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0442, 2007. \u0421.22. {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}</ref> (1963), ''Still-Life with Bouquet''<ref>''The Leningrad School of Painting.

However, for the general public and even for many colleagues in the Leningrad Union of Artists, he remained virtually unknown. The explanation for this must be sought primarily in the character traits of the artist. A man of independent views, talented, direct, sometimes ruthless in assessments and judgments,  astonishing those who knew him closely with his monstrous capacity for work, he eschewed the public life of the Union of Artists, was intolerant of any manifestations of mediocrity and imitation of creativity. In fact, during the Brezhnev years of stagnation and developed socialism he remained a man of the Khrushchev's thaw. In 1970\u20131980 Russov rarely showed his work at art exhibitions. His life was divided between a city workshop, a house in Pavshino on Oredezh and communication with a narrow circle of old friends. In fairness, we must admit that the existing system did not reject such artists, allowing them to have almost free materials and a workshop for creative work in exchange for minimal loyalty.\n\nIn mid-1960s Lev Russov enjoys wooden sculpture and Russian folk epic. From now until the end of life it becomes the main theme of his work, surpassing the painting. From his hands came out a lot of superb sculptures, from small figurines to large forms, such as ''Russian Icarus'' and the relief on the epic theme of ''Zastava'', ''Folk singers''.\n\n== Family ==\n\n* Wife Ekaterina Vasilievna Balebiba (1933\u20132002);\n* Son Andrei Lvovich Russov (b. 1960).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Portrait of Catherine Balebina]]\n* [[Portrait of Yevgeny Mravinsky]]\n* [[Fine Art of Leningrad]]\n* [[Leningrad School of Painting]]\n* [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Principal exhibitions ==\n* 1954 (Leningrad): [[Spring exhibition (Leningrad, 1954)|''The Spring Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1954'']]\n* 1955 (Leningrad): [[Spring exhibition (Leningrad, 1955)|''The Spring Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1955'']]\n* 1956 (Leningrad): [[Autumn exhibition (Leningrad, 1956)|''The Fall Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1956'']]\n* 1957 (Leningrad): [[Anniversary Art Exhibition (Leningrad, 1957)|''1917\u20131957.

It, along with other aerodigestive reflexes such as [[Pharyngeal reflex#Reflexive pharyngeal swallow|reflexive pharyngeal swallowing]], prevents objects in the [[oral cavity]] from entering the throat except as part of normal [[swallowing]] and helps prevent [[choking]], and is a form of coughing.\n\n==Reflex arc==\nIn a [[reflex arc]], a series of physiological steps occur very rapidly to produce a reflex. Generally a [[sensory receptor]] receives an environmental stimulus, in this case from objects reaching nerves in the back of the throat, and sends a message via an [[afferent nerve]] to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS).

These results suggest that the muscles that control the gag reflex remain independent of those that control normal swallowing.

This reflex in particular functions as a protective system for the upper respiratory tract as it not only forces the glottis to close, thereby preventing any substances getting into the airways, but also clears the pharynx of any residual substances by a swallow.\n\nThis particular reflex is simply one of several aero digestive reflexes, including also the pharyngoglottal closure reflex (in which no swallowing occurs yet the [[glottis]] still closes) and the pharyngo-upper esophageal sphincter contractile reflex, which occurs mainly during gastroesophageal reflux episodes. All either forcibly close the glottis or allow the pharynx to remove particles into the digestive tract that may have been forced back up by both this tract and the upper respiratory tract. These reflexes can also protect the airways from any food or liquids that may spill over from the hypopharynx. The hypopharynx is the bottom part of pharynx, and can be considered the first area where the digestive tract splits from the airways. However, if the maximum capacity of fluids that the hypopharynx can safely hold is exceeded, then this excess fluid spills into the [[larynx]] and from there into the lungs. Therefore, these reflexes prevent levels reaching this maximum volume.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dua|first=Kulwinder|author2=Sri Naveen Surapaneni |author3=Shiko Kuribayashi |author4=Muhammed Hafeezullah |author5=Reza Shaker |title=Pharyngeal airway protective reflexes are triggered before the maximum volume of fluid that the hypopharynx can safely hold is exceeded|journal=Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol|date=May 2011|volume=301|issue=2|pages=G197-202|doi=10.1152/ajpgi.00046.2011|pmid=21566013|pmc=3154610}}</ref>\n\nSince both the digestive system and the respiratory system are connected by the pharynx, there are many problems and diseases that occur when the body is unable to regulate passage of food and air into the appropriate tracts.

Knight was a painter in the figurative, realist tradition and who embraced English [[Impressionism]]. In her long career, Knight was among the most successful and popular painters in Britain. Her success in the male-dominated British art establishment paved the way for greater status and recognition for women artists.<ref name=\"Broadley\">{{cite book|author=Rosie Broadley|publisher= National Portrait Gallery,London|year=2013|title=Laura Knight Portraits|isbn=978-1-85514-463-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929 she was created a [[Order of the British Empire|Dame]], and in 1936 became the first woman elected to full membership of the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]]. Her large retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1965 was the first for a woman. Knight was known for painting amidst the world of the theatre and ballet in London, and for being a [[war artist]] during the [[Second World War]].

The family had relations in northern France who were also in the lace-making business and in 1889 Knight was sent to them with the intention that she would eventually study art at a Parisian [[wikt:atelier|atelier]].

She continued to give private lessons after she left the School of Art, as both she and her sister Evangeline Agnes, known as Sissie, had been left to live alone on very little money, after the deaths of their mother, their sister Nellie and both their grandmothers.<ref name=\"Knowles\"/> At the School of Art, Laura met one of the most promising students, [[Harold Knight]], then aged 17, and determined that the best method of learning was to copy Harold's technique.<ref name=\"Cooke1\"/> They became friends, and married in 1903.<ref name=Artistotm/>\n\n===Staithes and Laren===\nIn 1894 the couple visited [[Staithes]], a fishing village on the Yorkshire coast, for a holiday and soon returned, accompanied by her sister Evangeline Agnes, to live and work there. In Staithes Laura drew the people of the fishing village and the surrounding farms, showing the hardship and poverty of their lives. She made studies, paintings and watercolours, often painting in muted, shadowy tones. Lack of money for expensive materials meant she produced few oil paintings at this time. Local children would sit for her, for pennies, giving her the opportunity to develop her figure painting technique. Less successful at this time were her landscape and thematic works. Although she painted on the moors, high inland from Staithes, she did not consider herself successful at resolving these studies into finished pieces. Later she recalled:\n\n{{quote|Even though my studio was so often warmed by burning canvases and drawings I do not regret all the experimental work done and destroyed. Staithes was too big a subject for an immature student, but working there I developed a visual memory which has stood me in good stead ever since.}}\n\nLaura Johnson and Harold Knight married in 1903 and made their first trip to the Netherlands in 1904. They spent six weeks there that year and six months there in 1905. They visited the artists colony at [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]]. The colony was a group of followers of the [[Hague School]] of artists who had been painting in remote rural communities since the 1850s. The Knights made a third trip to Laren in 1906 before spending that winter in [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=\"Knowles\"/>\n\n===Cornwall===\nIn late 1907 the Knights moved to Cornwall, staying first in [[Newlyn]], before moving to the nearby village of [[Lamorna]].<ref name=\"penz\">{{cite web| author=Penlee House Gallery & Museum|year=| title=Laura Knight 1877\u20131970| publisher=Penlee House Gallery & Museum|accessdate=22 August 2013|url=http://www.penleehouse.org.uk/artists/laura-knight.htm}}</ref> There, alongside [[Lamorna Birch]] and [[Alfred Munnings]], they became central figures in the artists colony known as the [[Newlyn School]].<ref name=\"penz2\">{{cite web| author=Penlee House Gallery & Museum | year= | title=The Newlyn School c.1880\u2013c.1940 | publisher=Penlee House Gallery & Museum | accessdate=22 August 2013|url=http://www.penleehouse.org.uk/newlyn-school.html}}</ref> By March 1908 both had work exhibited at the [[Newlyn Art Gallery]] and Harold Knight was an established professional portrait painter, while Laura Knight was still developing her art.

''The Beach'' was shown at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1909, and was considered a great success, showing Laura painting in a more Impressionist style than she had displayed previously.<ref name=\"Knowles\"/> About this time she began painting compositions of women in the open air, in the ''[[plein-air]]'' manner, often on the rocks or cliff-tops around Lamorna. Knight would sometimes use models from London who were prepared to pose nude.

Using mirrors, Knight painted herself and Naper as seen by someone entering the studio behind them both. As an art student Knight had not been permitted to directly paint nude models but, like all female art students in England at the time, was restricted to working from casts and copying existing drawings. Knight deeply resented this, and ''Self Portrait with Nude'' is a clear challenge, and reaction, to those rules.<ref name=\"Broadley\"/> The painting was first shown in 1913 at the [[Newlyn Art Gallery|Passmore Edwards Art Gallery]] in Newlyn, and was well received by both the local press and other artists. Although the Royal Academy rejected the painting for exhibition, it was shown at the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers in London, as ''The Model''. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''{{'}}s critic called the painting \"vulgar\", and suggested that it \"might quite appropriately have stayed in the artist's studio\".<ref name=\"Broadley\"/> Despite this reaction, Knight continued to exhibit the painting throughout her career, and it continued to receive press criticism. After Knight's death the picture, now known simply as ''Self Portrait'' (1913), was purchased by the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], and is now considered both a key work in the story of female self-portraiture and as symbolic of wider female emancipation.<ref name=\"Broadley\"/><ref name=\"Hughes\"/>\nIn 2015 [[Simon Schama]] described the painting as a \"masterpiece\" and \"incomparably, her greatest work, all at once conceptually complex, heroically independent, formally ingenious and lovingly sensual.\"<ref name=\"SSchmara\"/>\n\n===First World War===\nKnight worked with Ella Naper, who was experienced in [[Vitreous enamel|enameling techniques]], to produce a set of small enamel pieces featuring several ballet dancers, which were shown at the [[Fine Art Society]] in London in 1915.<ref name=\"BCMorden\">{{cite book|author=Barbara C.

Painting within a working circus forced Knight to paint at great speed, as the performers rarely had much time to pose. Knight responded by painting directly onto the canvas without any preliminary drawing. Whilst this led to some of her circus scenes appearing 'flat', her paintings of small groups of clowns, such as ''The Three Clowns'' (1930) and ''Old Time Clowns'' (1957), were much more successful.<ref name=\"Fox\"/> Knight's ''Circus Folk'' exhibition, at the Alpine Club in 1930, was heavily criticised in art journals, but her paintings of more mundane subjects, such as domestic interiors and London streets, were highly praised.<ref name=\"Fox\"/> Notable works from this period include ''Susie and the Wash-basin'' (1927), ''Blue and Gold'' (1927), ''A Cottage Bedroom'' (1929) and ''Spring in St. John's Wood'' (1933).<ref name=\"Fox\"/> In 1934 Knight developed a series of circus designs for the ''Modern Art for the Table'' tableware range produced by [[Clarice Cliff]].<ref name=\"Cliff\">{{cite book|author=Leonard Griffin|publisher=Pavilion Books Limited|year=1999|title=Clarice Cliff the Art of the Bizarre |isbn=1-86205-219-0}}</ref>\n\n===Recognition===\nAt the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in Amsterdam Knight won the [[Art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics|Silver Medal in Painting]] with the painting ''Boxer'' (1917), one of the series she had painted at Witley in 1916.<ref name=\"LGirls\"/> In 1929 Knight was made a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]], and in June 1931 she received an honorary degree from [[St. Andrews University]].<ref name=\"LGirls\"/> Knight was elected president of the [[Society of Women Artists]] in 1932 and held the post until 1967.<ref name=\"AFoster\"/> In 1936 she became the first woman since 1769 elected to full membership of the [[Royal Academy]].<ref name=\"Phaidon Editors\">{{cite book |last1=Phaidon Editors |title=Great women artists |date=2019 |publisher=Phaidon Press |isbn=978-0714878775 |page=219}}</ref><ref name=Artistotm>{{cite web |author=|url=http://www.racollection.org.uk/ixbin/indexplus?record=ART13732  |title=Artist of the Month, Dame Laura Knight RA (1877-1970) |date=July 2013 |accessdate=16 October 2017|work=Royal Academy}}</ref>{{efn |name=first}} The same year Knight published her first autobiography, ''Oil Paint and Grease Paint'', which became a best-seller, with four hardback editions followed in 1941 by a [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] paperback printing.<ref name=\"5Women\">{{cite book|author=Teresa Grimes, Judith Collins & Oriana Baddeley|publisher=Lennard Publishing|year=1989|title=Five Women Painters|isbn=1852910836}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1933 the Knights became regular visitors to [[Malvern, Worcestershire]], making an annual visit to the [[Malvern Festival (1929\u201339)|Malvern Festival]], which had been established by their friend [[Barry Jackson (director)|Barry Jackson]]. During one such visit Knight met [[George Bernard Shaw]] and painted his portrait.<ref name=\"ODNBlk\"/> A blue plaque at the Mount Pleasant Hotel on Belle Vue Terrace, Great Malvern, commemorates the time the Knights spent in the area.

Knight frequently returned to the racecourses and painted from the back of an antique [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] car, which was large enough to accommodate her easel. Often pairs of Gypsy women would pose at the open door of the Rolls-Royce, with the race-day crowds in the background. From Epsom, Knight was invited to the Gypsy settlement at [[Iver]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. Knight visited the Iver settlement, normally closed to outsiders, every day for several  months in the late 1930s. These visits resulted in a series of portraits of great intensity. Two women, in particular, sat a number of times for Knight, Lilo Smith, the subject of ''Old Gypsy Women'' (1938) and ''Gypsy Splendour'' (1939), and her daughter-in-law, Beulah.<ref name=ArtUKlk>{{cite web |author=Rosie Broadley|url=https://artuk.org/discover/stories/dame-laura-knight-portraits |title=Dame Laura Knight portraits |date=1 October 2013|accessdate=12 September 2017|work=Art UK}}</ref> ''Gypsy Splendour'' was shown at the Royal Academy in 1939, the year Lilo Smith died.<ref name=\"Broadley\"/>\n\n===Second World War===\n[[File:A Balloon Site, Coventry (1943) (Art.

The Committee agreed, and Knight went to Germany in January 1946 and spent three months observing the main trial from inside the courtroom.<ref name=\"Cooke1\"/><ref name=\"Akbar\"/> The result was the large oil painting, ''The Nuremberg Trial''. This painting departs from the realism of her wartime paintings, in that, whilst apparently realistically depicting the Nazi war criminals sitting in the dock, the rear and side walls of the courtroom are missing, to reveal a ruined city, partially in flames.<ref name=PSands>{{cite web |author=Philippe Sands|url=http://artuk.org/discover/stories/artwork-in-focus-the-nuremberg-trial/|title=Artwork in focus:''The Nuremberg Trial'' |date=25 May 2016|accessdate=14 September 2017|work= Art UK|author-link=Philippe Sands}}</ref>\n\nKnight explained this choice of composition in a letter to the War Artists' Advisory Committee:<ref name=\"Palmer\">{{cite book|author=Kathleen Palmer|publisher=Tate Publishing/Imperial War Museum|year=2011|title=Women War Artists|isbn=978-1-85437-989-4}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|In that ruined city death and destruction are ever present.

In 1948 Knight painted backstage at the [[Shakespeare Memorial Theatre]], mostly observing the work of the wardrobe department, still working under austerity restrictions.<ref name=\"Fox\"/> The same year she painted a large group portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] and several civic dignitaries opening the new Broadgate Centre in Coventry. A period of illness affected her work on this commission, and, despite Knight's repainting large parts of the canvas, the finished painting was not well received.<ref name=\"Fox\"/> A major exhibition of over eighty works by Knight was held at the Ian Nicol Gallery in [[Glasgow]], in 1952.<ref name=\"Broadley\"/> The following year Knight returned to the theatre, painting and producing crayon studies, backstage at the [[Old Vic]] in London during the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]]'s production of ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' & ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|Part 2]]''.<ref name=\"Broadley\"/> Throughout this period Knight continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy each year, most notably with a portrait of ''Jean Rhodes'', a professional strong woman known as 'The Mighty Mannequin', which when shown in 1955 led to further portrait commissions for Knight. In 1956 Knight worked backstage at the [[Royal Opera House]] during performances and rehearsals by the [[Bolshoi Ballet]].\n\nIn 1961 Harold Knight died at Colwall; the couple had been married fifty-eight years. Knight's second autobiography, ''The Magic of a Line'' was published in 1965, to coincide with a major retrospective of her work at the Royal Academy. The exhibition, the first such for a woman at the Academy,<ref name=\"Spalding\">{{cite book|author=Frances Spalding|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1990|title=20th Century Painters and

Knight was a painter in the figurative, realist tradition and who embraced English [[Impressionism]]. In her long career, Knight was among the most successful and popular painters in Britain. Her success in the male-dominated British art establishment paved the way for greater status and recognition for women artists.<ref name=\"Broadley\">{{cite book|author=Rosie Broadley|publisher= National Portrait Gallery,London|year=2013|title=Laura Knight Portraits|isbn=978-1-85514-463-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929 she was created a [[Order of the British Empire|Dame]], and in 1936 became the first woman elected to full membership of the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]]. Her large retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1965 was the first for a woman. Knight was known for painting amidst the world of the theatre and ballet in London, and for being a [[war artist]] during the [[Second World War]].

The family had relations in northern France who were also in the lace-making business and in 1889 Knight was sent to them with the intention that she would eventually study art at a Parisian [[wikt:atelier|atelier]]. After a miserable time in French schools, the bankruptcy of her French relations forced Knight to return to England.<ref name=\"SSchmara\">{{cite book|author=Simon Schama|publisher=Viking|year=2015|title=The Face of Britain \u2013 The Nation Through Its Portraits|isbn=978-0-670-92229-1|author-link=Simon Schama}}</ref>\n\nCharlotte Johnson taught part-time at the [[Nottingham Trent University, School of Art and Design|Nottingham School of Art]], and managed to have Knight enrolled as an 'artisan student' there, paying no fees, aged just 13.<ref name=\"Broadley\"/><ref name=\"Knowles\">{{cite book| author=Elizabeth Knowles | publisher=Sansom & Co|year=2012 | title=Laura Knight in the open air | isbn=978-1-906593-65-0}}</ref> At the age of fifteen, and still a student herself, Knight took over her mother's teaching duties when Charlotte was diagnosed with cancer and became seriously ill.<ref name=\"SSchmara\"/> Later Knight won a scholarship and the gold medal in the national student competition held by the then [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]]. She continued to give private lessons after she left the School of Art, as both she and her sister Evangeline Agnes, known as Sissie, had been left to live alone on very little money, after the deaths of their mother, their sister Nellie and both their grandmothers.<ref name=\"Knowles\"/> At the School of Art, Laura met one of the most promising students, [[Harold Knight]], then aged 17, and determined that the best method of learning was to copy Harold's technique.<ref name=\"Cooke1\"/> They became friends, and married in 1903.<ref name=Artistotm/>\n\n===Staithes and Laren===\nIn 1894 the couple visited [[Staithes]], a fishing village on the Yorkshire coast, for a holiday and soon returned, accompanied by her sister Evangeline Agnes, to live and work there. In Staithes Laura drew the people of the fishing village and the surrounding farms, showing the hardship and poverty of their lives. She made studies, paintings and watercolours, often painting in muted, shadowy tones. Lack of money for expensive materials meant she produced few oil paintings at this time. Local children would sit for her, for pennies, giving her the opportunity to develop her figure painting technique. Less successful at this time were her landscape and thematic works. Although she painted on the moors, high inland from Staithes, she did not consider herself successful at resolving these studies into finished pieces. Later she recalled:\n\n{{quote|Even though my studio was so often warmed by burning canvases and drawings I do not regret all the experimental work done and destroyed. Staithes was too big a subject for an immature student, but working there I developed a visual memory which has stood me in good stead ever since.}}\n\nLaura Johnson and Harold Knight married in 1903 and made their first trip to the Netherlands in 1904. They spent six weeks there that year and six months there in 1905. They visited the artists colony at [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]]. The colony was a group of followers of the [[Hague School]] of artists who had been painting in remote rural communities since the 1850s. The Knights made a third trip to Laren in 1906 before spending that winter in [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=\"Knowles\"/>\n\n===Cornwall===\nIn late 1907 the Knights moved to Cornwall, staying first in [[Newlyn]], before moving to the nearby village of [[Lamorna]].<ref name=\"penz\">{{cite web| author=Penlee House Gallery & Museum|year=| title=Laura Knight 1877\u20131970| publisher=Penlee House Gallery & Museum|accessdate=22 August 2013|url=http://www.penleehouse.org.uk/artists/laura-knight.htm}}</ref> There, alongside [[Lamorna Birch]] and [[Alfred Munnings]], they became central figures in the artists colony known as the [[Newlyn School]].<ref name=\"penz2\">{{cite web| author=Penlee House Gallery & Museum | year= | title=The Newlyn School c.1880\u2013c.1940 | publisher=Penlee House Gallery & Museum | accessdate=22 August 2013|url=http://www.penleehouse.org.uk/newlyn-school.html}}</ref> By March 1908 both had work exhibited at the [[Newlyn Art Gallery]] and Harold Knight was an established professional portrait painter, while Laura Knight was still developing her art.

''The Beach'' was shown at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1909, and was considered a great success, showing Laura painting in a more Impressionist style than she had displayed previously.<ref name=\"Knowles\"/> About this time she began painting compositions of women in the open air, in the ''[[plein-air]]'' manner, often on the rocks or cliff-tops around Lamorna. Knight would sometimes use models from London who were prepared to pose nude. Although there was some resentment locally about this, the landowner, a Colonel Paynter, was fully supportive and allowed Knight and the other artists a free rein.<ref name=\"CFNewlyn\"/> ''Daughters of the Sun'', which showed several women, some naked, sitting by a coastal inlet was completed in 1911 and well received when shown at the Royal Academy, but was subsequently damaged and destroyed.<ref name=\"CWallace\">{{cite book|author=Catherine Wallace|publisher=truran|year=2002|title=Under the Open Sky - The Paintings of the Newlyn and Lamorna Artists 1880-1940 in the Public Collections of Cornwall and Plymouth|isbn=978-185022-168-5}}</ref> In recent years examples of Knight's plein-air compositions from Cornwall have attracted high prices at auction.<ref name=\"GGreer\">{{cite web|author=Germaine Greer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jun/20/paula-rego-dame-germaine-greer|title=Paula Rego is the fourth women painter to be made a dame.

Using mirrors, Knight painted herself and Naper as seen by someone entering the studio behind them both. As an art student Knight had not been permitted to directly paint nude models but, like all female art students in England at the time, was restricted to working from casts and copying existing drawings. Knight deeply resented this, and ''Self Portrait with Nude'' is a clear challenge, and reaction, to those rules.<ref name=\"Broadley\"/> The painting was first shown in 1913 at the [[Newlyn Art Gallery|Passmore Edwards Art Gallery]] in Newlyn, and was well received by both the local press and other artists. Although the Royal Academy rejected the painting for exhibition, it was shown at the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers in London, as ''The Model''. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''{{'}}s critic called the painting \"vulgar\", and suggested that it \"might quite appropriately have stayed in the artist's studio\".<ref name=\"Broadley\"/> Despite this reaction, Knight continued to exhibit the painting throughout her career, and it continued to receive press criticism. After Knight's death the picture, now known simply as ''Self Portrait'' (1913), was purchased by the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], and is now considered both a key work in the story of female self-portraiture and as symbolic of wider female emancipation.<ref name=\"Broadley\"/><ref name=\"Hughes\"/>\nIn 2015 [[Simon Schama]] described the painting as a \"masterpiece\" and \"incomparably, her greatest work, all at once conceptually complex, heroically independent, formally ingenious and lovingly sensual.\"<ref name=\"SSchmara\"/>\n\n===First World War===\nKnight worked with Ella Naper, who was experienced in [[Vitreous enamel|enameling techniques]], to produce a set of small enamel pieces featuring several ballet dancers, which were shown at the [[Fine Art Society]] in London in 1915.<ref name=\"BCMorden\">{{cite book|author=Barbara C.

Painting within a working circus forced Knight to paint at great speed, as the performers rarely had much time to pose. Knight responded by painting directly onto the canvas without any preliminary drawing. Whilst this led to some of her circus scenes appearing 'flat', her paintings of small groups of clowns, such as ''The Three Clowns'' (1930) and ''Old Time Clowns'' (1957), were much more successful.<ref name=\"Fox\"/> Knight's ''Circus Folk'' exhibition, at the Alpine Club in 1930, was heavily criticised in art journals, but her paintings of more mundane subjects, such as domestic interiors and London streets, were highly praised.<ref name=\"Fox\"/> Notable works from this period include ''Susie and the Wash-basin'' (1927), ''Blue and Gold'' (1927), ''A Cottage Bedroom'' (1929) and ''Spring in St. John's Wood'' (1933).<ref name=\"Fox\"/> In 1934 Knight developed a series of circus designs for the ''Modern Art for the Table'' tableware range produced by [[Clarice Cliff]].<ref name=\"Cliff\">{{cite book|author=Leonard Griffin|publisher=Pavilion Books Limited|year=1999|title=Clarice Cliff the Art of the Bizarre |isbn=1-86205-219-0}}</ref>\n\n===Recognition===\nAt the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in Amsterdam Knight won the [[Art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics|Silver Medal in Painting]] with the painting ''Boxer'' (1917), one of the series she had painted at Witley in 1916.<ref name=\"LGirls\"/> In 1929 Knight was made a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]], and in June 1931 she received an honorary degree from [[St. Andrews University]].<ref name=\"LGirls\"/> Knight was elected president of the [[Society of Women Artists]] in 1932 and held the post until 1967.<ref name=\"AFoster\"/> In 1936 she became the first woman since 1769 elected to full membership of the [[Royal Academy]].<ref name=\"Phaidon Editors\">{{cite book |last1=Phaidon Editors |title=Great women artists |date=2019 |publisher=Phaidon Press |isbn=978-0714878775 |page=219}}</ref><ref name=Artistotm>{{cite web |author=|url=http://www.racollection.org.uk/ixbin/indexplus?record=ART13732  |title=Artist of the Month, Dame Laura Knight RA (1877-1970) |date=July 2013 |accessdate=16 October 2017|work=Royal Academy}}</ref>{{efn |name=first}} The same year Knight published her first autobiography, ''Oil Paint and Grease Paint'', which became a best-seller, with four hardback editions followed in 1941 by a [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] paperback printing.<ref name=\"5Women\">{{cite book|author=Teresa Grimes, Judith Collins & Oriana Baddeley|publisher=Lennard Publishing|year=1989|title=Five Women Painters|isbn=1852910836}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1933 the Knights became regular visitors to [[Malvern, Worcestershire]], making an annual visit to the [[Malvern Festival (1929\u201339)|Malvern Festival]], which had been established by their friend [[Barry Jackson (director)|Barry Jackson]]. During one such visit Knight met [[George Bernard Shaw]] and painted his portrait.<ref name=\"ODNBlk\"/> A blue plaque at the Mount Pleasant Hotel on Belle Vue Terrace, Great Malvern, commemorates the time the Knights spent in the area. They found much inspiration for their work in the Malvern Hills and in the surrounding countryside and by the start of World War Two the couple were living at [[Colwall]] in [[Herefordshire]].<ref name=\"ODNBlk\"/>\n\n===Gypsies===\nIn the mid-1930s Knight befriended and painted groups of Gypsies at the [[Epsom Downs Racecourse|Epsom]] and [[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]] racecourses. Knight frequently returned to the racecourses and painted from the back of an antique [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] car, which was large enough to accommodate her easel. Often pairs of Gypsy women would pose at the open door of the Rolls-Royce, with the race-day crowds in the background. From Epsom, Knight was invited to the Gypsy settlement at [[Iver]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. Knight visited the Iver settlement, normally closed to outsiders, every day for several  months in the late 1930s. These visits resulted in a series of portraits of great intensity. Two women, in particular, sat a number of times for Knight, Lilo Smith, the subject of ''Old Gypsy Women'' (1938) and ''Gypsy Splendour'' (1939), and her daughter-in-law, Beulah.<ref name=ArtUKlk>{{cite web |author=Rosie Broadley|url=https://artuk.org/discover/stories/dame-laura-knight-portraits |title=Dame Laura Knight portraits |date=1 October 2013|accessdate=12 September 2017|work=Art UK}}</ref> ''Gypsy Splendour'' was shown at the Royal Academy in 1939, the year Lilo Smith died.<ref name=\"Broadley\"/>\n\n===Second World War===\n[[File:A Balloon Site, Coventry (1943) (Art.

Knight hired two [[Suffolk Punch]] horses and a plough from a farmer and painted them outdoors in a cherry orchard on Averills' farm in Worcestershire. Her original design for the WLA poster was rejected for placing too much emphasis on the horses rather than the women working. A new design, with a single woman, was accepted. Knight painted her 1940 Royal Academy entry, ''January 1940'', showing a similar scene at the same time.<ref name=\"LGirls\"/> During the [[Second World War]], Knight was an official war artist, contracted by the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]] on several short-term commissions.<ref name=\"Canadian War Museum\">{{cite web |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cwm/exhibitions/artwar/artists/laura-knight_e.shtml |title=Dame Knight, Laura, RA (1877\u20131970) |publisher=[[Canadian War Museum]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003150019/http://www.civilization.ca/cwm/exhibitions/artwar/artists/laura-knight_e.shtml |archivedate=3 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nAmong the works Knight produced for these commissions were:\n\n* ''Corporal J.

The painting, along with Knight and Loftus, also featured in a British Paramount News short film shown in cinemas,<ref name=\"Foss\"/> and was reproduced in a poster version by WAAC.<ref name=\"Fox\"/> The success of the painting led to further industrial commissions for Knight throughout the 1940s. In 1945 she painted ''Switch Works'' at Ellison Switchgear in Birmingham. This was followed by paintings of operations at the Dow Mac concrete railway-sleeper works and at the Skefko ball bearing factory.<ref name=\"Broadley\"/>\n* ''Take Off'' (1944) \u2013 a large and complex group portrait of the four-man crew of a [[Short Stirling]] bomber, deep in concentration, preparing for a flight, which Knight painted over several months at [[RAF Mildenhall]]. Knight lived in the WAAF Officers' Mess while on the base, and the RAF gave her the use of an obsolete Stirling to work in while preparing the painting. When Knight learned that the navigator in the picture, Raymond Frankish Escreet, had been killed in action, she arranged that his family received a photograph of the painting.<ref name=\"Broadley\"/>\n\nIn total, Knight had seventeen completed paintings, together with numerous studies, accepted by the WAAC, most of which were exhibited in the [[National Gallery]] during World War II. Throughout the war Knight also continued taking private commissions, usually for individual or family portraits. The most notable war-time example of these is the composition, ''Betty and William Jacklin''  showing a mother and child, along with their pet rabbit and the Malvern countryside in background, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1942, beside ''In for Repairs''.\n\n===Nuremberg 1946===\n[[File:The Nuremberg Trial, 1946 (1946) (Art.

The Committee agreed, and Knight went to Germany in January 1946 and spent three months observing the main trial from inside the courtroom.<ref name=\"Cooke1\"/><ref name=\"Akbar\"/> The result was the large oil painting, ''The Nuremberg Trial''.

In 1948 Knight painted backstage at the [[Shakespeare Memorial Theatre]], mostly observing the work of the wardrobe department, still working under austerity restrictions.<ref name=\"Fox\"/> The same year she painted a large group portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] and several civic dignitaries opening the new Broadgate Centre in Coventry. A period of illness affected her work on this commission, and, despite Knight's repainting large parts of the canvas, the finished painting was not well received.<ref name=\"Fox\"/> A major exhibition of over eighty works by Knight was held at the Ian Nicol Gallery in [[Glasgow]], in 1952.<ref name=\"Broadley\"/> The following year Knight returned to the theatre, painting and producing crayon studies, backstage at the [[Old Vic]] in London during the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]]'s production of ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' & ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|Part 2]]''.<ref name=\"Broadley\"/> Throughout this period Knight continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy each year, most notably with a portrait of ''Jean Rhodes'', a professional strong woman known as 'The Mighty Mannequin', which when shown in 1955 led to further portrait commissions for Knight. In 1956 Knight worked backstage at the [[Royal Opera House]] during performances and rehearsals by the [[Bolshoi Ballet]].\n\nIn 1961 Harold Knight died at Colwall; the couple had been married fifty-eight years. Knight's second autobiography, ''The Magic of a Line'' was published in 1965, to coincide with a major retrospective of her work at the Royal Academy.
