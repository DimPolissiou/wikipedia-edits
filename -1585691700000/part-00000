Van den Broeck specialised in the [[time trial]] discipline, having been Junior World Champion against the clock in 2001. The promise he first displayed in minor stage races like the [[Tour de Romandie]] and [[BinckBank Tour of Benelux|Eneco Tour]] was later validated and confirmed by top-10 finishes in all three Grand Tours: the [[Giro d'Italia]], the [[Tour de France]] and the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]].\n\n==Cycling career==\n\n===Early career===\nBorn in [[Herentals]], Van den Broeck won the [[UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Junior men's time trial|Junior World Time Trial Championship]] in [[2001 UCI Road World Championships|2001]] and made his professional debut in 2003 as a ''stagiaire'' for the Quick-Step\u2013Davitamon\u2013Latexco team.\n\n===U.S. Postal Service/Discovery Channel (2004\u20132006)===\nRather than remaining in Belgium, however, Van den Broeck signed with the American {{ct|DSC|2004}} team of [[Lance Armstrong]] for his first full season as a professional in 2004. His only result of note that year was 6th-place overall in the [[Tour of Belgium]].\n\nVan den Broeck remained with [[Johan Bruyneel]]'s team in 2005 when Discovery Channel took over the title sponsorship, and he continued with the Americans in 2006 after Armstrong retired. During that period he finished on the podium in stages of the [[2006 Deutschland Tour|Deutschland Tour]] and the Tour of Belgium (where he also won the mountains classification), and he rode to a top-20 finish overall in the [[2006 Tour de Romandie|Tour de Romandie]]. In June, however, Van den Broeck announced his intention to return to Belgium when he agreed to a two-year contract with the then-Davitamon squad, which would be re-branded in 2007 as {{ct|OLO|2007}}. The following month Van den Broeck scored his first win as a professional, taking the Schriek, Derny in Belgium ahead of [[Erwin Vervecken]] and future [[cyclo-cross]] world champion [[Niels Albert]].<ref>http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ritfiche.php?ritid=71805</ref><ref>http://www.cyclingarchives.com/wedstrijdfiche.php?wedstrijdid=3453</ref>\n\n===Predictor\u2013Lotto (2007\u20132015)===\n====2007\u20132008====\nAt the age of 24, Van den Broeck managed to finish in the top-10 on the general classification at the [[2007 Eneco Tour]] with his new team, though he also won the bronze medal in the [[Belgian National Time Trial Championships]].<ref>http://www.cyclingarchives.com/coureurfiche.php?coureurid=7415</ref> After completing his first Grand Tour in an anonymous 74th place at the [[2007 Giro d'Italia]], Van den Broeck finally showed that he had talent as a stage racer when he returned to Italy the following year and came seventh overall in the [[2008 Giro d'Italia]]. Merely months later, both [[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]] and [[Emanuele Sella]]&nbsp;\u2013 respectively finishing 2nd and 6th in the [[2008 Giro d'Italia]]&nbsp;\u2013 were sanctioned for doping.\n\n====2009====\n[[File:Jurgen Van Den Broeck Eneco Tour 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Van den Broeck at the [[2009 Eneco Tour]]]]\nShowing excellent form in the [[2009 Tour de France]], Van den Broeck climbed with the leaders through the Alps, although he had crashed heavily on the fourth stage [[team time trial]], and lost more than seven minutes. His consistency resulted in 15th place in the final general classification ranking, which was later improved to 14th after the disqualification of 11th placed [[Mikel Astarloza]] for testing positive for EPO; he also placed 9th place in the competition for the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|polka dot jersey]]. As the performances came at the end of [[Cadel Evans]]' tenure at {{ct|LTS|2009}}, the Belgian outfit decided that Van den Broeck was capable and reliable enough to become their general classification leader.\n\n====2010\u20132011====\nThe following season he rode to an important and somewhat surprising 3rd place (5th place before [[Alberto Contador]] and [[Denis Menchov]]'s disqualification) in the [[2010 Tour de France]], becoming the first Belgian to finish in the top 5 since [[Claude Criquielion]] in [[1986 Tour de France|1986]]. After the Tour Van den Broeck won two criteriums: one in [[Peer, Belgium|Peer]] and the other in his hometown of [[Herentals]].\n\nIn the [[2011 Tour de France]], after an encouraging first week and while aiming for a general classification podium spot, Van den Broeck had to abandon the race along with another overall contender, [[Alexander Vinokourov]], after a massive and spectacularly grim downhill crash which left him with a [[pneumothorax]], broken ribs and a fractured shoulder.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/sports/110710_VDB|title=Jurgen Van den Broeck crashes out of Tour de France|accessdate=2011-07-12|work=deredactie.be|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713111857/http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/sports/110710_VDB|archivedate=13 July 2011}}</ref> Not to be deterred, however, Van den Broeck recovered from his injuries in time to compete in the [[2011 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]], where he finished 8th overall.\n\n====2012\u20132015====\nIn 2012, Van den Broeck finished 3rd in the [[2012 Volta a Catalunya|Volta a Catalunya]] and then finished 5th in the [[2012 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9|Criterium du Dauphin\u00e9]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cycling/18386547|title=Bradley Wiggins plays down Tour chances after Dauphine triumph|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=10 June 2012|accessdate=4 July 2017}}</ref> showing good form for the forthcoming Tour de France.

Van den Broeck specialised in the [[time trial]] discipline, having been Junior World Champion against the clock in 2001. The promise he first displayed in minor stage races like the [[Tour de Romandie]] and [[BinckBank Tour of Benelux|Eneco Tour]] was later validated and confirmed by top-10 finishes in all three Grand Tours: the [[Giro d'Italia]], the [[Tour de France]] and the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]].\n\n==Cycling career==\n\n===Early career===\nBorn in [[Herentals]], Van den Broeck won the [[UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Junior men's time trial|Junior World Time Trial Championship]] in [[2001 UCI Road World Championships|2001]] and made his professional debut in 2003 as a ''stagiaire'' for the Quick-Step\u2013Davitamon\u2013Latexco team.\n\n===U.S. Postal Service/Discovery Channel (2004\u20132006)===\nRather than remaining in Belgium, however, Van den Broeck signed with the American {{ct|DSC|2004}} team of [[Lance Armstrong]] for his first full season as a professional in 2004. His only result of note that year was 6th-place overall in the [[Tour of Belgium]].\n\nVan den Broeck remained with [[Johan Bruyneel]]'s team in 2005 when Discovery Channel took over the title sponsorship, and he continued with the Americans in 2006 after Armstrong retired. During that period he finished on the podium in stages of the [[2006 Deutschland Tour|Deutschland Tour]] and the Tour of Belgium (where he also won the mountains classification), and he rode to a top-20 finish overall in the [[2006 Tour de Romandie|Tour de Romandie]]. In June, however, Van den Broeck announced his intention to return to Belgium when he agreed to a two-year contract with the then-Davitamon squad, which would be re-branded in 2007 as {{ct|OLO|2007}}. The following month Van den Broeck scored his first win as a professional, taking the Schriek, Derny in Belgium ahead of [[Erwin Vervecken]] and future [[cyclo-cross]] world champion [[Niels Albert]].<ref>http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ritfiche.php?ritid=71805</ref><ref>http://www.cyclingarchives.com/wedstrijdfiche.php?wedstrijdid=3453</ref>\n\n===Predictor\u2013Lotto (2007\u20132015)===\n====2007\u20132008====\nAt the age of 24, Van den Broeck managed to finish in the top-10 on the general classification at the [[2007 Eneco Tour]] with his new team, though he also won the bronze medal in the [[Belgian National Time Trial Championships]].<ref>http://www.cyclingarchives.com/coureurfiche.php?coureurid=7415</ref> After completing his first Grand Tour in an anonymous 74th place at the [[2007 Giro d'Italia]], Van den Broeck finally showed that he had talent as a stage racer when he returned to Italy the following year and came seventh overall in the [[2008 Giro d'Italia]]. Merely months later, both [[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]] and [[Emanuele Sella]]&nbsp;\u2013 respectively finishing 2nd and 6th in the [[2008 Giro d'Italia]]&nbsp;\u2013 were sanctioned for doping.\n\n====2009====\n[[File:Jurgen Van Den Broeck Eneco Tour 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Van den Broeck at the [[2009 Eneco Tour]]]]\nShowing excellent form in the [[2009 Tour de France]], Van den Broeck climbed with the leaders through the Alps, although he had crashed heavily on the fourth stage [[team time trial]], and lost more than seven minutes. His consistency resulted in 15th place in the final general classification ranking, which was later improved to 14th after the disqualification of 11th placed [[Mikel Astarloza]] for testing positive for EPO; he also placed 9th place in the competition for the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|polka dot jersey]]. As the performances came at the end of [[Cadel Evans]]' tenure at {{ct|LTS|2009}}, the Belgian outfit decided that Van den Broeck was capable and reliable enough to become their general classification leader.\n\n====2010\u20132011====\nThe following season he rode to an important and somewhat surprising 3rd place (5th place before [[Alberto Contador]] and [[Denis Menchov]]'s disqualification) in the [[2010 Tour de France]], becoming the first Belgian to finish in the top 5 since [[Claude Criquielion]] in [[1986 Tour de France|1986]]. After the Tour Van den Broeck won two criteriums: one in [[Peer, Belgium|Peer]] and the other in his hometown of [[Herentals]].\n\nIn the [[2011 Tour de France]], after an encouraging first week and while aiming for a general classification podium spot, Van den Broeck had to abandon the race along with another overall contender, [[Alexander Vinokourov]], after a massive and spectacularly grim downhill crash which left him with a [[pneumothorax]], broken ribs and a fractured shoulder.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/sports/110710_VDB|title=Jurgen Van den Broeck crashes out of Tour de France|accessdate=2011-07-12|work=deredactie.be|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713111857/http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/sports/110710_VDB|archivedate=13 July 2011}}</ref> Not to be deterred, however, Van den Broeck recovered from his injuries in time to compete in the [[2011 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]], where he finished 8th overall.\n\n====2012\u20132015====\nIn 2012, Van den Broeck finished 3rd in the [[2012 Volta a Catalunya|Volta a Catalunya]] and then finished 5th in the [[2012 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9|Criterium du Dauphin\u00e9]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cycling/18386547|title=Bradley Wiggins plays down Tour chances after Dauphine triumph|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=10 June 2012|accessdate=4 July 2017}}</ref> showing good form for the forthcoming Tour de France.

It was developed between 1985 and 1990, with several subsequent expansion and renovation projects.\n\nThe centre has over 250 shops, a separate [[retail park]], [[Movie theater|cinema]], [[food hall]] and ten-thousand [[parking spaces]]. Adjacent to the main shopping centre is a [[marina]] called '''The Waterfront''' accommodating a number of bars, restaurants and the studios of [[Black Country Radio]]. The [[Dudley Canal|Dudley No.1 Canal]] passes though The Waterfront and along the edge of the shopping centre before descending to [[Delph Locks]].\n\nThe centre's original developers and owners were [[Don Richardson (businessman)|Richardson Developments]] but it has had a number of other owners including [[Elliott Bernerd|Chelsfield]], [[Mountleigh]] and [[Westfield Group|Westfield]]. It is currently owned by [[Intu Properties]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Express & Star Newspaper - Sell-off at Merry Hill | publisher = [[Midland News Association]] ([[Express & Star]]) | url = http://www.expressandstar.co.uk/2006/12/20/sell-off-at-merry-hill/ | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120730191742/http://www.expressandstar.co.uk/2006/12/20/sell-off-at-merry-hill/ | url-status = dead | archive-date = 30 July 2012 | accessdate = 2 January 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\nIn the 1980s, the UK Government created a number of [[enterprise zone]]s which gave incentives to firms wishing to set up business in areas which had been affected by a downturn in the manufacturing industry. The [[Brierley Hill]] area had suffered the loss of the [[Round Oak Steelworks]], and it was hoped that other manufacturers could be encouraged to move into the area. Incentives included relaxed planning rules and a ten-year period exempt from [[business rates]]. Developers saw the opportunity to take advantage of lack of restrictions by making a shopping centre, rather than industrial units originally envisaged as the mainstay of the Enterprise Zone.\n\nThe Enterprise Zone encompassed both the former steelworks site and a large open green space known as Merry Hill Farm. This was cherished locally as a haven for wildlife. During 1982, the site was bought by Richardson Developments with the intention of constructing a large shopping centre. December 1982 saw the closure of the Round Oak Steelworks after 125 years.\n\nThere was much hostility when building of the first phase of the shopping centre commenced on the green space, rather than on the former steelworks site, which itself was incorporated into the enterprise zone in 1984\u2009\u2014\u2009the year that the first phase of the complex: two retail parks and a shopping mall\u2009\u2014\u2009was given the go-ahead on 2 October 1984, with construction beginning that winter.<ref name=\"www2.dudley.gov.uk\">{{Cite web |url=http://www2.dudley.gov.uk/documents/BHAAP_Baseline_Report/chapter_298.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113092510/http://www2.dudley.gov.uk/documents/BHAAP_Baseline_Report/chapter_298.html |url-status=dead |title=Brierley Hill Area Action Plan Preferred Options Baseline Report |archivedate=13 January 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDespite protests from local residents, the project went ahead and by Christmas 1985 the first three stores\u2009\u2014\u2009 [[Queensway (retailer)|Harris Queensway]] furniture store, [[MFI Group|MFI]] home furnishings retail warehouse (the complex's very first tenant) and Atlantis Electrical superstore\u2009\u2014\u2009were trading from the site.\n\nIn November of that year, the Richardson twins announced plans to expand Merry Hill into a large indoor shopping centre to rival the recently completed developments at [[Telford]] in [[Shropshire]] and [[Milton Keynes]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], with a view to completing the development by 1990. The building contract for the shopping malls was let to [[Tarmac Group|Tarmac Construction]].<ref>Berry Ritchie, ''The Story of Tarmac'' page 108, Published by James & James (Publishers) Ltd, 1999</ref>\n\nThe first shopping centre and a second phase of the retail park (including [[Halfords]] and [[B&Q]] which is now [[Toys R Us]]) opened in April 1986 (incorporating the [[Carrefour]] [[hypermarket]] which opened on 1 July that year). However, Carrefour had pulled out of the store within two years and it was taken over by [[Gateway Foodmarkets]], whose tenure of the store was similarly short; by 1990 they had withdrawn from the store and it was taken over by [[Asda]], who have held the store's tenancy ever since.\n\nThe shopping mall was extended during 1987 on the ground floor and the upper level shops opened in early 1988. A 10-screen cinema was opened in November 1988.\n\nThe 350-seat Jules Verne food court, which offered a round-the-world eating experience and had a large globe-shaped balloon as its centerpiece, was opened in June 1989 on the upper level shopping mall. However, it had closed by the mid-1990s due to disappointing trade. It was redeveloped with shops including major stores such as: [[Next plc|Next]] and [[TK Maxx]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.showcase.co.uk/property/Merry-Hill/West-Midlands/Dudley/7490615|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119061429/http://www.showcase.co.uk/property/Merry-Hill/West-Midlands/Dudley/7490615|url-status=dead|title=Merry Hill Shopping Centre - Phase 1-5 Merry Hill|archivedate=19 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the final phase of the centre was finished in 1989, with the [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket next-door to fast-food chain [[Burger King]] opening in October and the remainder of the final phase of the complex opening on 14 November, incorporating multiple Debenhams and British Home Stores as some of the last big retail names to move to stores within the complex.\n\nIn August 1989, [[Marks and Spencer]] had agreed to become tenants of a new department store in the final phase of the shopping complex. It opened on 23 October 1990, replacing the recently closed stores in nearby towns [[West Bromwich]] and [[Dudley]]; the retailer had hoped that its Merry Hill store could co-exist with the West Bromwich and Dudley stores, but the onset of the [[early 1990s recession|recession]] and a general downturn in trade in these towns led to the closure of both stores on 25 August 1990.<ref name=\"www2.dudley.gov.uk\"/>\n\nOn 24 December 1990,<ref name=\"managementtoday.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/408984/uk-regional-focus-robin-hoods-merry-hill-richardson-brothers/|title=UK regional focus: Robin Hood's Merry Hill Richardson Brothers}}</ref> the shopping centre was sold to [[Mountleigh]].\n\nDevelopment of the steelworks site did not commence until autumn 1989, when construction began on The Waterfront development, which consisted of Phases 6\u20138. Phase 6 saw the construction of {{convert|69700|m2|sqft|0}} of offices (the first of which were occupied in December 1990), Phase 7 saw the construction of {{convert|6500|m2|sqft|0}} of restaurants and bars and Phase 8 saw the addition of a {{convert|15800|m2|sqft|0}} business park, which was completed in 1995. Waterfront Way was opened in early-December 1990 to serve the new complex and provide a road link to the shopping centre and also to the main A461 road.\n\nThe Waterfront development created some 4,000 jobs, but the onset of another [[late 2000s recession|recession]] in 2008 saw many businesses vacate the development, leaving a high percentage of office units empty. In June 2011, in a bid to bring jobs back to the Waterfront, the area was among the candidates for enterprise zone status once again\u2009\u2014\u200917 years after the original enterprise zone expired.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/06/10/waterfront-in-jobs-race/ |title = Waterfront in jobs race}}</ref>\n\nPhase 4 was partly remodelled in early 1996, a mere seven years after it had been built.<ref name=\"www2.dudley.gov.uk\"/>\n\nRoad access to the complex was improved in 1998 with the completion of alterations to the two access points from the A4036 main road between Dudley and Pedmore\u2009\u2014\u2009this resulted in more than forty houses being demolished to make way for the widened road and re-designed Quarry Bank junction. This project had first been proposed in 1989, and caused much controversy among residents whose houses were ultimately demolished to make way for the improvements.\n\nMerry Hill had brought about the first free-standing [[Pizza Hut]] in the UK, the first drive-thru [[McDonald's]] restaurant and the largest [[Texas Homecare]] store\u2009\u2014\u2009all opened during 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.davidlawson.co.uk/Files/RICHARDS_FE6.htm |title=Real estate twins do nothing by halves |publisher=David Lawson |year=1996 |accessdate=24 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWhile the centre was still being developed in the late-1980s, plans were unveiled to build the world's tallest tower at Merry Hill. The tower would have been 2,000 feet tall, with a hotel at its base, a restaurant halfway up and a nightclub plus observatory at the top. However, plans to build it were scrapped in 1992.<ref name=\"managementtoday.co.uk\"/>\n\nHaving already purchased a 50% share from [[Westfield Group|Westfield]] in March 2014, Intu Properties acquired the remaining 50% from the [[Queensland Investment Corporation]] in June 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-26662711 |title=Westfield sells Serby, Merry Hill and Sprucefield shopping centres to Intu |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=20 March 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://realassets.ipe.com/news/investors/qic-nears-uk-exit-following-400m-sale-of-retail-mall/realassets.ipe.com/news/investors/qic-nears-uk-exit-following-400m-sale-of-retail-mall/10013866.fullarticle |title=QIC nears UK exit following \u00a3400m sale of retail mall |publisher=IPE Real Assets |date=21 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Effect on surrounding towns===\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}\nWhen the Merry Hill Centre first opened, a number of large retail chains decided to move their stores from surrounding towns into the new shopping centre. These included: [[Marks & Spencer]], [[C&A]] (C&A closed in early-2001 and the store is now occupied by [[H&M]]) and formerly [[Littlewoods]], until they closed their branch. The Littlewoods chain went into administration in 2006, and the stores completely disappeared from UK high streets and shopping centres by 2007. These left a number of large empty premises behind, which in turn meant many shoppers abandoned town centres for the Merry Hill Centre, which led to a large downturn in trade for those shops remaining, affecting their viability.\n\nThe first retailer to move to Merry Hill was furniture retailer [[MFI Group|MFI]], who opened a retail warehousing unit during 1985. MFI would trade from this unit for 23 years until they went into liquidation in December 2008, with the store later being purchased and refurbished by electrical retailer BestBuy, who opened their store in May 2010.\n\nBy Christmas 1985, MFI had been joined by Queensway furniture store and electrical retailer Atlantis. Further retail warehousing units and a shopping mall were already under construction by this stage.\n\nBy the summer of 1986, two retail parks existed at the site, incorporating retailers including [[B&Q]], [[Halfords]] and [[Texas Homecare]].\n\nThe first shopping centre opened in April 1986, with [[France|French]] [[hypermarket]] giant [[Carrefour]] opening a store at the centre on 1 July that year. They sold the store to Gateway Foodmarkets two years later when withdrawing from the UK, and by 1990 it had been taken over by [[Asda]], who already had a store in Brierley Hill as well as several others in the wider [[Black Country]] area, but surprisingly, the Brierley Hill store remained open.\n\nA second shopping centre opened on the ground level in 1987 and the centre was expanded further in early 1988 to include an upper level, although the bulk of the centre was opened on 14 November 1989 - by which time it was the largest shopping centre in [[Europe]]. By the time of its completion, Merry Hill included several multiple stores including clothing retailers: [[C&A]] and [[Littlewoods]], general department store [[British Home Stores]] and supermarket chain [[Sainsbury's|Sainsburys]], as well as numerous smaller retailers.\n\nOn 23 October 1990, Marks & Spencer opened a new department store at Merry Hill (the final new store to open at the complex), replacing the recently closed stores in nearby [[Dudley]] and [[West Bromwich]]. The retailer had agreed to become tenants of a store at Merry Hill during the summer of 1989, but had hoped to keep their Dudley and West Bromwich stores open alongside it; however the declining trade in both of these towns led to both stores being closed on 25 August 1990, some two months before the Merry Hill store opened. A similar situation had arisen with [[British Home Stores]], who had opened a store in the final phase of the complex in November 1989, but continued to trade from its Dudley store; however the opening of the Merry Hill store was followed by a sharp decline in trade from the Dudley store, and the decision to close this store had been taken by March 1990, with the store finally closing June of that year.\n\nTwelve months after opening, the Marks & Spencer store expanded on the ground level into a neighbouring unit.\n\nIn the late-1990s, Marks & Spencer took over the lease of the former Littlewoods store and converted into a furniture and menswear store. The Littlewoods store had expanded some years earlier, taking in a former [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] store on the upper level; there had been fears that Woolworths would close at least some of their branches in nearby towns when the Merry Hill store opened, but trade from the Woolworths at Merry Hill was relatively disappointing and ironically the local Woolworths stores all outlasted the Merry Hill store by well over a decade, only closing when the retailer went into liquidation over the 2008/09 winter.\n\nThe completion of Merry Hill resulted in the loss of many big name retailers from nearby town centres, with Dudley arguably being the hardest hit, suffering a 70% decline in retailing market share following Merry Hill's opening.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chase & Partners Report Appendix 4 \u2013 Dudley|url=http://www.the-blackcountry.com/images/Study/chase%20and%20partners%20report%20appendix%204.pdf|publisher=Black Country Consortium|accessdate=5 September 2013}}{{dead link|date=August 2016}}</ref> However, some retailers kept their stores in nearby towns open, despite opening new stores at Merry Hill. [[WH Smith]], who have been at Merry Hill since 1989, still have a store in [[Halesowen]], and even opened a new store in [[Stourbridge]] during the 1990s. The Dudley store also remained open, but closed in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=WH Smith store in Dudley is to shut|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2013/06/29/wh-smith-store-in-dudley-is-to-shut/|accessdate=5 September 2013|newspaper=Express & Star|date=29 June 2013}}</ref> C&A, who had a store at Merry Hill from November 1989 until withdrawing from the UK in 2001, kept their Dudley store open until January 1992. Littlewoods kept their Dudley store open for two months after its Merry Hill replacement opened in November 1989, cashing in on the 1989 Christmas sales before closing in January 1990. British Home Stores had intended to continue trading from their Dudley store, but a sharp fall in trade following the Merry Hill store's opening led to the decision to close the Dudley store, with it closing in June 1990.\n\nA further blow came when the local council, [[Dudley Metropolitan Borough]], announced that it was bringing in parking charges throughout the area; this turned more shoppers away from local town centres, and towards the Merry Hill Centre, where parking remains free. Though there have been plans for introducing parking charges at the centre, this has been criticised, ironically, due to fears of impacting trade.<ref>{{cite news|title=Merry Hill parking charge would damage region say critics|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/10/14/merry-hill-parking-charge-would-damage-region-say-critics/|accessdate=5 September 2013|newspaper=Express & Star|date=14 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Merry Hill Centre, along with nearby Brierley Hill, was redesignated as the 'strategic town centre' of the Dudley Borough, and thus the focus of future local government investment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Local Development Framework - Brierley Hill AAP|url=http://www.dudley.gov.uk/resident/planning/planning-policy/local-development-framework/bhill-aap/|publisher=Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council|accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Merry Hill Centre continues to draw most of its trade from the local area. The developers did plan that the centre would attract visitors from across the country, by building coach parks; however these were redeveloped with private housing and flats in 2003.\n\n===Monorail===\n{{MH Monorail}}\nAn elevated [[monorail]] was opened at Merry Hill in June 1991, but this closed in 1996 as a result of a combination of technical problems and safety concerns (especially the difficulty of evacuation), exacerbated by a dispute between the owners of Merry Hill and The Waterfront which at this time were owned separately.  The infrastructure was later removed, leaving only one disused monorail station and part of the old railings visible\u2014on top of the [[Marks and Spencer]] store roof.\n\nThe monorail cost \u00a322,000,000 to build, the construction work taking place along with the final phase of the shopping complex in 1988/89, but due to health and safety concerns it did not open until 19 months after the centre was complete.\n\nThere were to be five stations, with the system extending over the canal and terminating close to the site of the former [[Round Oak railway station]] where an interchange with a [[West Midlands Metro]] extension was proposed. However, only the first four stations were completed.\n\nThe system was officially opened on 1 June 1991. The actual public opening was delayed while [[Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate]] investigated evacuation procedures. After operating for a short while, the monorail was temporarily closed again in 1992,<ref name=\"lrta-128\">{{cite web|url=http://lrta.info/Facts/facts128.html |publisher=[[Light Rail Transit Association]] - UK Development Group |work=Fact Sheet No 128 |title=Portsmouth's Monorail - Privately Financed |quote=\"Merry Hill train terror\" was the headline as 20 shoppers waited to be rescued from the monorail jammed 50 feet above ground.

The [[Dudley Canal]] was re-routed in the late-1990s, and between 2002-2005, housing has been developed around the complex (several apartment blocks opposite the cinema as well as apartments and houses overlooking Pedmore Road). A new line of the [[West Midlands Metro]] [[tram]] system was scheduled to reach the site in 2011, but has been delayed indefinitely.\n\nIn July 2017, plans were revealed to expand the centre to include more restaurants and to open a new Odeon cinema inside the centre to replace the old multiplex at the retail park. In 2018, a new 75,000 sq ft flagship [[Next plc|Next]] store opened replacing the [[Sainsbury's]] store that closed on 31 December 2016.\n\n==Transport==\n===Bus station===\nA bus station has served Merry Hill since its opening, but the current, more substantial bus station was developed in the early 1990s and gives direct connections to towns including [[Dudley]], [[Halesowen]], [[Stourbridge]], [[Walsall]], [[West Bromwich]] and Cradley Heath as well as the cities of [[Birmingham]] and [[Wolverhampton]].\n\nSimilarly, the bus services connect the centre to [[Cradley Heath railway station]], for [[West Midlands Trains]] services to [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill]], [[Kidderminster railway station|Kidderminster]] and [[Worcester Shrub Hill railway station|Worcester]] via [[Stourbridge Junction railway station|Stourbridge Junction]].\n\nVarious distance bus services from Merry Hill are operated by [[Arriva Midlands]], [[Diamond West Midlands]] and [[National Express West Midlands]].\n\n===West Midlands Metro===\n[[Transport for West Midlands]] (TfWM) will open a new line of the [[West Midlands Metro]] from [[Wednesbury Great Western Street tram stop| Wednesbury]] to Brierley Hill, with a new stop at Merry Hill, planned to open in 2023.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metroalliance.co.uk/wednesbury-brierley-hill/|title=Wednesbury To Brierley Hill|date=4 July 2016|language=en-GB|access-date=7 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918034847/http://www.metroalliance.co.uk/wednesbury-brierley-hill/|archive-date=18 September 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==In culture==\nThe areas around Next, TK Maxx, H&M, Eat Central, the amphitheatre and outside Debenhams at Merry Hill made an appearance on the popular Cartoon Network show, [[The Amazing World of Gumball]] as \"Elmore Mall\" in the episode called \"The Mothers\", Eat Central also made an appearance in the episode called \"The Burden\".

It was developed between 1985 and 1990, with several subsequent expansion and renovation projects.\n\nThe centre has over 250 shops, a separate [[retail park]], [[Movie theater|cinema]], [[food hall]] and ten-thousand [[parking spaces]]. Adjacent to the main shopping centre is a [[marina]] called '''The Waterfront''' accommodating a number of bars, restaurants and the studios of [[Black Country Radio]]. The [[Dudley Canal|Dudley No.1 Canal]] passes though The Waterfront and along the edge of the shopping centre before descending to [[Delph Locks]].\n\nThe centre's original developers and owners were [[Don Richardson (businessman)|Richardson Developments]] but it has had a number of other owners including [[Elliott Bernerd|Chelsfield]], [[Mountleigh]] and [[Westfield Group|Westfield]]. It is currently owned by [[Intu Properties]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Express & Star Newspaper - Sell-off at Merry Hill | publisher = [[Midland News Association]] ([[Express & Star]]) | url = http://www.expressandstar.co.uk/2006/12/20/sell-off-at-merry-hill/ | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120730191742/http://www.expressandstar.co.uk/2006/12/20/sell-off-at-merry-hill/ | url-status = dead | archive-date = 30 July 2012 | accessdate = 2 January 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\nIn the 1980s, the UK Government created a number of [[enterprise zone]]s which gave incentives to firms wishing to set up business in areas which had been affected by a downturn in the manufacturing industry. The [[Brierley Hill]] area had suffered the loss of the [[Round Oak Steelworks]], and it was hoped that other manufacturers could be encouraged to move into the area. Incentives included relaxed planning rules and a ten-year period exempt from [[business rates]]. Developers saw the opportunity to take advantage of lack of restrictions by making a shopping centre, rather than industrial units originally envisaged as the mainstay of the Enterprise Zone.\n\nThe Enterprise Zone encompassed both the former steelworks site and a large open green space known as Merry Hill Farm. This was cherished locally as a haven for wildlife. During 1982, the site was bought by Richardson Developments with the intention of constructing a large shopping centre. December 1982 saw the closure of the Round Oak Steelworks after 125 years.\n\nThere was much hostility when building of the first phase of the shopping centre commenced on the green space, rather than on the former steelworks site, which itself was incorporated into the enterprise zone in 1984 - the year that the first phase of the complex - two retail parks and a shopping mall - was given the go-ahead on 2 October 1984, with construction beginning that winter.<ref name=\"www2.dudley.gov.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www2.dudley.gov.uk/documents/BHAAP_Baseline_Report/chapter_298.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113092510/http://www2.dudley.gov.uk/documents/BHAAP_Baseline_Report/chapter_298.html|url-status=dead|title=Brierley Hill Area Action Plan Preferred Options Baseline Report|archivedate=13 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nDespite protests from local residents, the project went ahead and by Christmas 1985 the first three stores - [[Queensway (retailer)|Harris Queensway]] furniture store, [[MFI Group|MFI]] home furnishings retail warehouse (the complex's very first tenant) and Atlantis Electrical superstore - were trading from the site.\n\nIn November of that year, the Richardson twins announced plans to expand Merry Hill into a large indoor shopping centre to rival the recently completed developments at [[Telford]] in [[Shropshire]] and [[Milton Keynes]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], with a view to completing the development by 1990. The building contract for the shopping malls was let to [[Tarmac Group|Tarmac Construction]].<ref>Berry Ritchie, ''The Story of Tarmac'' page 108, Published by James & James (Publishers) Ltd, 1999</ref>\n\nThe first shopping centre and a second phase of the retail park (including [[Halfords]] and [[B&Q]] which is now [[Toys R Us]]) opened in April 1986 (incorporating the [[Carrefour]] [[hypermarket]] which opened on 1 July that year). However, Carrefour had pulled out of the store within two years and it was taken over by [[Gateway Foodmarkets]], whose tenure of the store was similarly short; by 1990 they had withdrawn from the store and it was taken over by [[Asda]], who have held the store's tenancy ever since.\n\nThe shopping mall was extended during 1987 on the ground floor and the upper level shops opened in early 1988. A 10-screen cinema was opened in November 1988.\n\nThe 350-seat Jules Verne food court, which offered a round-the-world eating experience and had a large globe-shaped balloon as its centerpiece, was opened in June 1989 on the upper level shopping mall. However, it had closed by the mid-1990s due to disappointing trade. It was redeveloped with shops including major stores such as: [[Next plc|Next]] and [[TK Maxx]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.showcase.co.uk/property/Merry-Hill/West-Midlands/Dudley/7490615|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119061429/http://www.showcase.co.uk/property/Merry-Hill/West-Midlands/Dudley/7490615|url-status=dead|title=Merry Hill Shopping Centre - Phase 1-5 Merry Hill|archivedate=19 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the final phase of the centre was finished in 1989, with the [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket next-door to fast-food chain [[Burger King]] opening in October and the remainder of the final phase of the complex opening on 14 November, incorporating multiple Debenhams and British Home Stores as some of the last big retail names to move to stores within the complex.\n\nIn August 1989, [[Marks and Spencer]] had agreed to become tenants of a new department store in the final phase of the shopping complex. It opened on 23 October 1990, replacing the recently closed stores in nearby towns [[West Bromwich]] and [[Dudley]]; the retailer had hoped that its Merry Hill store could co-exist with the West Bromwich and Dudley stores, but the onset of the [[Early 1990s recession|recession]] and a general downturn in trade in these towns led to the closure of both stores on 25 August 1990.<ref name=\"www2.dudley.gov.uk\"/>\n\nOn 24 December 1990,<ref name=\"managementtoday.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/408984/uk-regional-focus-robin-hoods-merry-hill-richardson-brothers/|title=UK regional focus: Robin Hood's Merry Hill Richardson Brothers}}</ref> the shopping centre was sold to [[Mountleigh]].\n\nDevelopment of the steelworks site did not commence until autumn 1989, when construction began on The Waterfront development, which consisted of Phases 6-8. Phase 6 saw the construction of {{convert|69700|m2|sqft|0}} of offices (the first of which were occupied in December 1990), Phase 7 saw the construction of {{convert|6500|m2|sqft|0}} of restaurants and bars and Phase 8 saw the addition of a {{convert|15800|m2|sqft|0}} business park, which was completed in 1995. Waterfront Way was opened in early-December 1990 to serve the new complex and provide a road link to the shopping centre and also to the main A461 road.\n\nThe Waterfront development created some 4,000 jobs, but the onset of the [[Late 2000s recession|recession]] in 2008 saw many businesses vacate the development, leaving a high percentage of office units empty. In June 2011, in a bid to bring jobs back to the Waterfront, the area was among the candidates for enterprise zone status once again - 17 years after the original enterprise zone expired.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/06/10/waterfront-in-jobs-race/ |title = Waterfront in jobs race}}</ref>\n\nPhase 4 was partly remodelled in early 1996, a mere seven years after it had been built.<ref name=\"www2.dudley.gov.uk\"/>\n\nRoad access to the complex was improved in 1998 with the completion of alterations to the two access points from the A4036 main road between Dudley and Pedmore - this resulted in more than forty houses being demolished to make way for the widened road and re-designed Quarry Bank junction. This project had first been proposed in 1989, and caused much controversy among residents whose houses were ultimately demolished to make way for the improvements.\n\nMerry Hill had brought about the first free-standing [[Pizza Hut]] in the UK, the first drive-thru [[McDonald's]] restaurant and the largest [[Texas Homecare]] store - all opened during 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.davidlawson.co.uk/Files/RICHARDS_FE6.htm |title=Real estate twins do nothing by halves |publisher=David Lawson |author=David Lawson |year=1996 |accessdate=24 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nWhile the centre was still being developed in the late-1980s, plans were unveiled to build the world's tallest tower at Merry Hill. The tower would have been 2,000 feet tall, with a hotel at its base, a restaurant halfway up and a nightclub plus observatory at the top. However, plans to build it were scrapped in 1992.<ref name=\"managementtoday.co.uk\"/>\n\nHaving already purchased a 50% share from [[Westfield Group|Westfield]] in March 2014, Intu Properties acquired the remaining 50% from the [[Queensland Investment Corporation]] in June 2016.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-26662711 Westfield sells Serby, Merry Hill and Sprucefield shopping centres to Intu] ''[[BBC News]]'' 20 March 2014</ref><ref>[https://realassets.ipe.com/news/investors/qic-nears-uk-exit-following-400m-sale-of-retail-mall/realassets.ipe.com/news/investors/qic-nears-uk-exit-following-400m-sale-of-retail-mall/10013866.fullarticle QIC nears UK exit following \u00a3400m sale of retail mall] IPE Real Assets 21 June 2016</ref>\n\n===Effect on surrounding towns===\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}\nWhen the Merry Hill Centre first opened, a number of large retail chains decided to move their stores from surrounding towns into the new shopping centre. These included: [[Marks & Spencer]], [[C&A]] (C&A closed in early-2001 and the store is now occupied by [[H&M]]) and formerly [[Littlewoods]], until they closed their branch. The Littlewoods chain went into administration in 2006, and the stores completely disappeared from UK high streets and shopping centres by 2007. These left a number of large empty premises behind, which in turn meant many shoppers abandoned town centres for the Merry Hill Centre, which led to a large downturn in trade for those shops remaining, affecting their viability.\n\nThe first retailer to move to Merry Hill was furniture retailer [[MFI Group|MFI]], who opened a retail warehousing unit during 1985. MFI would trade from this unit for 23 years until they went into liquidation in December 2008, with the store later being purchased and refurbished by electrical retailer BestBuy, who opened their store in May 2010.\n\nBy Christmas 1985, MFI had been joined by Queensway furniture store and electrical retailer Atlantis. Further retail warehousing units and a shopping mall were already under construction by this stage.\n\nBy the summer of 1986, two retail parks existed at the site, incorporating retailers including [[B&Q]], [[Halfords]] and [[Texas Homecare]].\n\nThe first shopping centre opened in April 1986, with [[France|French]] [[hypermarket]] giant [[Carrefour]] opening a store at the centre on 1 July that year. They sold the store to Gateway Foodmarkets two years later when withdrawing from the UK, and by 1990 it had been taken over by [[Asda]], who already had a store in Brierley Hill as well as several others in the wider [[Black Country]] area, but surprisingly, the Brierley Hill store remained open.\n\nA second shopping centre opened on the ground level in 1987 and the centre was expanded further in early 1988 to include an upper level, although the bulk of the centre was opened on 14 November 1989 - by which time it was the largest shopping centre in [[Europe]]. By the time of its completion, Merry Hill included several multiple stores including clothing retailers: [[C&A]] and [[Littlewoods]], general department store [[British Home Stores]] and supermarket chain [[Sainsbury's|Sainsburys]], as well as numerous smaller retailers.\n\nOn 23 October 1990, Marks & Spencer opened a new department store at Merry Hill (the final new store to open at the complex), replacing the recently closed stores in nearby [[Dudley]] and [[West Bromwich]]. The retailer had agreed to become tenants of a store at Merry Hill during the summer of 1989, but had hoped to keep their Dudley and West Bromwich stores open alongside it; however the declining trade in both of these towns led to both stores being closed on 25 August 1990, some two months before the Merry Hill store opened. A similar situation had arisen with [[British Home Stores]], who had opened a store in the final phase of the complex in November 1989, but continued to trade from its Dudley store; however the opening of the Merry Hill store was followed by a sharp decline in trade from the Dudley store, and the decision to close this store had been taken by March 1990, with the store finally closing June of that year.\n\nTwelve months after opening, the Marks & Spencer store expanded on the ground level into a neighbouring unit.\n\nIn the late-1990s, Marks & Spencer took over the lease of the former Littlewoods store and converted into a furniture and menswear store. The Littlewoods store had expanded some years earlier, taking in a former [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] store on the upper level; there had been fears that Woolworths would close at least some of their branches in nearby towns when the Merry Hill store opened, but trade from the Woolworths at Merry Hill was relatively disappointing and ironically the local Woolworths stores all outlasted the Merry Hill store by well over a decade, only closing when the retailer went into liquidation over the 2008/09 winter.\n\nThe completion of Merry Hill resulted in the loss of many big name retailers from nearby town centres, with Dudley arguably being the hardest hit, suffering a 70% decline in retailing market share following Merry Hill's opening.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chase & Partners Report Appendix 4 \u2013 Dudley|url=http://www.the-blackcountry.com/images/Study/chase%20and%20partners%20report%20appendix%204.pdf|publisher=Black Country Consortium|accessdate=5 September 2013}}{{dead link|date=August 2016}}</ref> However, some retailers kept their stores in nearby towns open, despite opening new stores at Merry Hill. [[WH Smith]], who have been at Merry Hill since 1989, still have a store in [[Halesowen]], and even opened a new store in [[Stourbridge]] during the 1990s. The Dudley store also remained open, but closed in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=WH Smith store in Dudley is to shut|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2013/06/29/wh-smith-store-in-dudley-is-to-shut/|accessdate=5 September 2013|newspaper=Express & Star|date=29 June 2013}}</ref> C&A, who had a store at Merry Hill from November 1989 until withdrawing from the UK in 2001, kept their Dudley store open until January 1992. Littlewoods kept their Dudley store open for two months after its Merry Hill replacement opened in November 1989, cashing in on the 1989 Christmas sales before closing in January 1990. British Home Stores had intended to continue trading from their Dudley store, but a sharp fall in trade following the Merry Hill store's opening led to the decision to close the Dudley store, with it closing in June 1990.\n\nA further blow came when the local council, [[Dudley Metropolitan Borough]], announced that it was bringing in parking charges throughout the area; this turned more shoppers away from local town centres, and towards the Merry Hill Centre, where parking remains free. Though there have been plans for introducing parking charges at the centre, this has been criticised, ironically, due to fears of impacting trade.<ref>{{cite news|title=Merry Hill parking charge would damage region say critics|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/10/14/merry-hill-parking-charge-would-damage-region-say-critics/|accessdate=5 September 2013|newspaper=Express & Star|date=14 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Merry Hill Centre, along with nearby Brierley Hill, was redesignated as the 'strategic town centre' of the Dudley Borough, and thus the focus of future local government investment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Local Development Framework - Brierley Hill AAP|url=http://www.dudley.gov.uk/resident/planning/planning-policy/local-development-framework/bhill-aap/|publisher=Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council|accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Merry Hill Centre continues to draw most of its trade from the local area. The developers did plan that the centre would attract visitors from across the country, by building coach parks; however these were redeveloped with private housing and flats in 2003.\n\n===Monorail===\n{{MH Monorail}}\nAn elevated [[monorail]] was opened at Merry Hill in June 1991, but this closed in 1996 as a result of a combination of technical problems and safety concerns (especially the difficulty of evacuation), exacerbated by a dispute between the owners of Merry Hill and The Waterfront which at this time were owned separately.  The infrastructure was later removed, leaving only one disused monorail station and part of the old railings visible\u2014on top of the [[Marks and Spencer]] store roof.\n\nThe monorail cost \u00a322,000,000 to build, the construction work taking place along with the final phase of the shopping complex in 1988/89, but due to health and safety concerns it did not open until 19 months after the centre was complete.\n\nThere were to be five stations, with the system extending over the canal and terminating close to the site of the former [[Round Oak railway station]] where an interchange with a [[West Midlands Metro]] extension was proposed. However, only the first four stations were completed.\n\nThe system was officially opened on 1 June 1991. The actual public opening was delayed while [[Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate]] investigated evacuation procedures.

It was originally owned by [[UCI Cinemas]] and was refurbished in 2005 following a merger with the [[Odeon Cinemas]] chain.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Recent developments==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nThe owners and local council leaders have stated their aim to better connect and integrate Merry Hill with the traditional town centre of Brierley Hill. The [[Dudley Canal]] was re-routed in the late-1990s, and between 2002-2005, housing has been developed around the complex (several apartment blocks opposite the cinema as well as apartments and houses overlooking Pedmore Road). A new line of the [[West Midlands Metro]] [[tram]] system was scheduled to reach the site in 2011, but has been delayed indefinitely.\n\nIn July 2017, plans were revealed to expand the centre to include more restaurants and to open a new Odeon cinema inside the centre to replace the old multiplex at the retail park. In 2018, a new 75,000 sq ft flagship [[Next plc|Next]] store opened replacing the [[Sainsbury's]] store that closed on 31 December 2016.\n\n==Transport==\n===Bus station===\nA bus station has served Merry Hill since its opening, but the current, more substantial bus station was developed in the early 1990s and gives direct connections to towns including [[Dudley]], [[Halesowen]], [[Stourbridge]], [[Walsall]], [[West Bromwich]] and Cradley Heath as well as the cities of [[Birmingham]] and [[Wolverhampton]].\n\nSimilarly, the bus services connect the centre to [[Cradley Heath railway station]], for [[West Midlands Trains]] services to [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill]], [[Kidderminster railway station|Kidderminster]] and [[Worcester Shrub Hill railway station|Worcester]] via [[Stourbridge Junction railway station|Stourbridge Junction]].\n\nVarious distance bus services from Merry Hill are operated by [[Arriva Midlands]], [[Diamond West Midlands]] and [[National Express West Midlands]].\n\n===West Midlands Metro===\n[[Transport for West Midlands]] (TfWM) will open a new line of the [[West Midlands Metro]] from [[Wednesbury Great Western Street tram stop| Wednesbury]] to Brierley Hill, with a new stop at Merry Hill, planned to open in 2023.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metroalliance.co.uk/wednesbury-brierley-hill/|title=Wednesbury To Brierley Hill|date=4 July 2016|language=en-GB|access-date=7 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918034847/http://www.metroalliance.co.uk/wednesbury-brierley-hill/|archive-date=18 September 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==In culture==\nThe areas around Next, TK Maxx, H&M, Eat Central, the amphitheatre and outside Debenhams at Merry Hill made an appearance on the popular Cartoon Network show, [[The Amazing World of Gumball]] as \"Elmore Mall\" in the episode called \"The Mothers\", Eat Central also made an appearance in the episode called \"The Burden\".

{"title_page": "Claude Lecomte (Opera director)", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=February 2019}}\n{{other uses|Claude Lecomte}}\n\n'''Claude Lecomte''' was an 18th-century French financier who participated in the direction of the [[Paris Opera|Acad\u00e9mie Royale de musique]] on two occasions between 1730 and 1733. \n\nBefore taking an interest in the Opera, he was a sub-farmer of the subsidies of the [[G\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de Paris]]. On May 19, 1730, he joined Maximilien-Claude Gruer, Abraham Coussard and Fran\u00e7ois Le B\u0153uf de Vaudahon in a company that would support Gruer, who had received the [[Privilege (law)|privilege]] of the Opera. \n\nBut relations between partners stretched very quickly, and on 18 October, Gruer decided to form a new association with Mogniac and Hennes. Lecomte protested and refused to transfer the rights he had taken in the company. However, it eventually gave in under pressure from the [[Minister for the Maison du Roi|secr\u00e9taire d'\u00c9tat de la Maison du roi]]. \n\nHowever, he tried to denigrate Gruer to take his place.

On May 19, 1730, he joined Maximilien-Claude Gruer, Abraham Coussard and Fran\u00e7ois Le B\u0153uf de Vaudahon in a company that would support Gruer, who had received the [[Privilege (law)|privilege]] of the Opera. \n\nBut relations between partners stretched very quickly, and on 18 October, Gruer decided to form a new association with Mogniac and Hennes. Lecomte protested and refused to transfer the rights he had taken in the company. However, it eventually gave in under pressure from the [[Minister for the Maison du Roi|secr\u00e9taire d'\u00c9tat de la Maison du roi]]. \n\nHowever, he tried to denigrate Gruer to take his place. The opportunity was found when the director of the Opera was involved in a scandal with singers from the Acad\u00e9mie. \n\nThe king was forced to withdraw the management from Gruer and the privilege was finally granted on 18 August 1731 to Claude Lecomte, who managed the Opera with Fran\u00e7ois Le B\u0153uf. \n\nBut it was soon revealed that Claude Lecomte's son, who had been entrusted by his father with the task of running the cash register, was committing irregularities.
