He succeeded his stepfather, [[Augustus]].\n\nBorn to [[Tiberius Claudius Nero (praetor 42 BC)|Tiberius Claudius Nero]] and [[Livia|Livia Drusilla]] in a [[Claudia (gens)|Claudian family]], he was given the [[personal name]] '''Tiberius Claudius Nero'''. His mother divorced Nero and married [[Augustus|Octavian]]\u2014later to ascend to Emperor as Augustus\u2014who officially became his [[stepfather]]. Tiberius would later marry Augustus' daughter (from his marriage to [[Scribonia (wife of Augustus)|Scribonia]]), [[Julia the Elder]], and even [[Adoption in ancient Rome|later be adopted]] by Augustus. Through the adoption, he officially became a [[Julia (gens)|Julian]], [[Roman naming conventions|assuming the name]] '''Tiberius Julius Caesar'''. The emperors after Tiberius would continue this blended dynasty of both families for the following thirty years; historians have named it the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. His relationship to the other emperors of this dynasty was as follows: he was the stepson of Augustus, grand-uncle of [[Caligula]], paternal uncle of [[Claudius]], and great-grand uncle of [[Nero]]. Tiberius' 22-and-a-half-year reign would be the longest after that of Augustus until that of Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]], who surpassed his reign by a few months.\n\nTiberius was one of the greatest [[Roman general]]s; his conquest of [[Pannonia]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Raetia]], and (temporarily) parts of [[Germania]] laid the foundations for the northern frontier. Even so, he came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive and sombre ruler who never really desired to be emperor; [[Pliny the Elder]] called him \"the gloomiest of men\".<ref>Pliny the Elder, ''Natural Histories'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/28*.html#v XXVIII.5.23]; Capes, [https://archive.org/details/romanhistoryear03capegoog/page/n99 p. 71]</ref> After the death of his son [[Drusus Julius Caesar]] in 23 AD, Tiberius became more reclusive and aloof. In 26 AD he removed himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his unscrupulous [[Praetorian prefect]]s [[Sejanus|Lucius Aelius Sejanus]] and [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Quintus Naevius Sutorius Macro]]. When Tiberius died, he was succeeded by his grand-nephew and adopted grandson, Caligula.<ref name=\"Tiberius2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/tiberius.html |title=Tiberius |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}</ref>\n\n==Early life (42\u20136 BC)==\n{{Julio-Claudian dynasty}}\n[[File:Livia y Tiberio M.A.N. 01.JPG|thumb|250px|Tiberius and his mother [[Livia]], AD 14\u201319, from [[Paestum]], [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]], Madrid]]\n\n=== Background ===\nTiberius was born in [[Rome]] on 16 November 42&nbsp;BC to [[Tiberius Claudius Nero (praetor 42 BC)|Tiberius Claudius Nero]] and [[Livia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tiberius |title=Tiberius {{!}} Roman emperor |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2018-03-08 |language=en}}</ref><ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#5 5]</ref> In 39&nbsp;BC his mother [[divorce]]d his biological father and, though again pregnant by Tiberius Nero, married [[Augustus|Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus]].

Historians generally agree that it is during this time that the question of Augustus' heir became most acute, and while Augustus had seemed to indicate that [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]] would carry on his position in the event of his death, the ambiguity of succession became Augustus' chief problem.<ref>[[#Southern|Southern]], pp. 119\u2013120.</ref>\n\nIn response, a series of potential heirs seem to have been selected, among them Tiberius and his brother Drusus.

In 20&nbsp;BC, Tiberius was sent east under [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]].<ref>[[#Levick|Levick]], p. 24.</ref> The [[Parthian Empire]] had captured the standards of the [[Roman legion|legions]] under the command of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] (53&nbsp;BC) (at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]), Decidius Saxa (40&nbsp;BC), and [[Mark Antony]] (36&nbsp;BC).<ref name=\"suetonius-tiberius-9\" />\n\nAfter a year of negotiation, Tiberius led a sizable force into [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], presumably with the goal of establishing it as a Roman [[client state]] and ending the threat it posed on the Roman-Parthian border. Augustus was able to reach a compromise whereby the standards were returned, and Armenia remained a neutral territory between the two powers.<ref name=\"suetonius-tiberius-9\" />\n\n[[File:Vipsania.jpg|thumb|250px|A bust of [[Vipsania Agrippina]], Tiberius' first wife, recovered from [[Leptis Magna]]]]\nTiberius married [[Vipsania Agrippina]], the daughter of Augustus' close friend and greatest general, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]].<ref name=\"suetonius-tiberius-7\">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#7 7]</ref> He was appointed to the position of [[praetor]], and was sent with his legions to assist his brother Drusus in campaigns in the west. While Drusus focused his forces in [[Gallia Narbonensis]] and along the German frontier, Tiberius combated the tribes in the [[Alps]] and within [[Transalpine Gaul]], [[Conquest of the Alps|conquering Raetia]]. In 15&nbsp;BC he discovered the sources of the [[Danube]], and soon afterward the bend of the middle course.<ref>Strabo, 7.

As such, in 12&nbsp;BC he received military commissions in [[Pannonia]] and [[Germania]]; both areas highly volatile and of key importance to Augustan policy.\n\n[[File:Germania Enobarbo e Tiberio.jpg|thumb|350px|The campaigns of Tiberius, [[Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 16 BC)|Ahenobarbus]], and [[Gaius Sentius Saturninus|Saturninus]] in [[Germania]] between 6 BC and 1 BC]]\nIn 6 BC, Tiberius launched a [[pincer movement]] against the [[Marcomanni]]. Setting out northwest from [[Carnuntum]] on the Danube with four legions, Tiberius passed through [[Quadi]] territory in order to invade Marcomanni territory from the east. Meanwhile, general [[Gaius Sentius Saturninus]] would depart east from [[Moguntiacum]] on the [[Rhine]] with two or three legions, pass through newly annexed [[Hermunduri]] territory, and attack the Marcomanni from the west. The campaign was a resounding success, but Tiberius could not subjugate the Marcomanni because he was soon summoned to the Rhine frontier to protect Rome's new conquests in Germania.\n\nHe returned to Rome and was consul for a second time in 7&nbsp;BC, and in 6&nbsp;BC was granted [[tribune|tribunician power]] ''(tribunicia potestas)'' and control in the East,<ref name=\"cassius-dio-rhistory-lv-9\">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html#9 LV.9]</ref> all of which mirrored positions that Agrippa had previously held. However, despite these successes and despite his advancement, Tiberius was not happy.<ref>[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], p. 23.</ref>\n\n==Midlife (6 BC \u2013 14 AD)==\n=== Retirement to Rhodes (6 BC) ===\n[[File:SperlongaVillaTiberio.jpg|thumb|250px|Remnants of Tiberius' villa at [[Sperlonga]], on the coast midway between Rome and Naples]]\nIn 6&nbsp;BC, on the verge of accepting command in the East and becoming the second-most powerful man in Rome, Tiberius suddenly announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to [[Rhodes]].<ref>[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], pp. 23\u201324.</ref> The precise motives for Tiberius's withdrawal are unclear.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#10 10]</ref> Historians have speculated a connection with the fact that Augustus had adopted Julia's sons by Agrippa, [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] and [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]], and seemed to be moving them along the same political path that both Tiberius and Drusus had trodden.<ref>[[#Levick|Levick]], p. 29.</ref>\n\nTiberius' move thus seemed to be an interim solution: he would hold power only until his stepsons would come of age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, behavior of his unhappily married wife, Julia,<ref>Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#100 II.100]</ref> may have also played a part.<ref name=\"cassius-dio-rhistory-lv-9\" /> Indeed, [[Tacitus]] calls it Tiberius' ''intima causa'', his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred of Julia and a longing for Vipsania.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#53|I.53]]</ref> Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the [[Roman Forum]], and forbidden to see the woman he had loved.<ref name=sag26 />\n\nWhatever Tiberius' motives, the withdrawal was almost disastrous for Augustus' succession plans. Gaius and Lucius were still in their early teens, and Augustus, now 57 years old, had no immediate successor. There was no longer a guarantee of a peaceful transfer of power after Augustus' death, nor a guarantee that his family, and therefore his family's allies, would continue to hold power should the position of ''[[Princeps]]'' survive.<ref name=sag26>[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], p. 26.</ref>\n\nSomewhat apocryphal stories tell of Augustus pleading with Tiberius to stay, even going so far as to stage a serious illness.<ref name=\"sag26\" /> Tiberius' response was to anchor off the shore of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] until word came that Augustus had survived, then sailing straightway for Rhodes.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#11 11]</ref> Tiberius reportedly regretted his departure and requested to return to Rome several times, but each time Augustus refused his requests.<ref>[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], p. 28.</ref>\n\n=== Heir to Augustus ===\nWith Tiberius' departure, succession rested solely on Augustus' two young grandsons, Lucius and Gaius Caesar. The situation became more precarious in AD&nbsp;2 with the death of Lucius. Augustus, with perhaps some pressure from Livia, allowed Tiberius to return to Rome as a private citizen and nothing more.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#13 13]</ref> In AD&nbsp;4, Gaius was killed in Armenia, and Augustus had no other choice but to turn to Tiberius.<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-i-3\">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#3|I.3]]</ref><ref name=\"penelope1\">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#15 15]</ref>\n\nThe death of Gaius in AD&nbsp;4 initiated a flurry of activity in the household of Augustus. Tiberius was adopted as full son and heir, and in turn he was required to adopt his nephew [[Germanicus]], the son of his brother Drusus and Augustus' niece [[Antonia Minor]].<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-i-3\" /><ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html#13 LV.13]</ref> Along with his adoption, Tiberius received tribunician power as well as a share of Augustus' ''maius imperium'', something that even Marcus Agrippa may never have had.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#21 21].

He seems to have wished for the Senate and the state to simply act without him and his direct orders were rather vague, inspiring debate more on what he actually meant than on passing his legislation.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#32|III.32]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#52|III.52]]</ref> In his first few years, Tiberius seemed to have wanted the Senate to act on its own,<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#35|III.35]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#53|III.53]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#54|III.54]]</ref> rather than as a servant to his will as it had been under Augustus.

The Roman legions posted in Pannonia and in Germania had not been paid the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and after a short period of time mutinied when it was clear that a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#16|I.16]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#17|I.17]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#31|I.31]]</ref> [[Germanicus]] and Tiberius's son, [[Drusus Julius Caesar]], were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line.<ref name=\"LVII.6\">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/57*.html#6 LVII.6]</ref>\n\nRather than simply quell the mutiny, however, Germanicus rallied the mutineers and led them on a short campaign across the Rhine into Germanic territory, stating that whatever treasure they could grab would count as their bonus.<ref name=\"LVII.6\"/> Germanicus's forces crossed the Rhine and quickly occupied all of the territory between the Rhine and the [[Elbe]]. Additionally, Tacitus records the capture of the [[Teutoburg forest]] and the reclaiming of Roman [[aquila (Roman)|standards]] lost years before by [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]],<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-ii-41\">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#41|II.41]]</ref> when three Roman legions and their auxiliary cohorts [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|had been ambushed]] by Germanic tribes.<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-ii-46\">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#46|II.46]]</ref>\n\nGermanicus had managed to deal a significant blow to Rome's enemies, quell an uprising of troops, and returned lost standards to Rome, actions that increased the fame and legend of the already very popular Germanicus with the Roman people.<ref>Shotter, 35\u201337.</ref>\n\nAfter being recalled from Germania,<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#26|II.26]]</ref> Germanicus celebrated a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in Rome in AD&nbsp;17,<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-ii-41\" /> the first full triumph that the city had seen since Augustus' own in 29&nbsp;BC. As a result, in AD&nbsp;18 Germanicus was granted control over the eastern part of the empire, just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before, and was clearly the successor to Tiberius.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#43|II.43]]</ref> Germanicus survived a little over a year before dying, accusing [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]], the governor of [[Syria]], of poisoning him.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#71|II.71]]</ref>\n\nThe Pisones had been longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with the young Octavian after his marriage to Livia, the mother of Tiberius. Germanicus's death and accusations indicted the new Princeps. Piso was placed on trial and, according to Tacitus, threatened to implicate Tiberius.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#16|III.16]]</ref> Whether the governor actually could connect the Princeps to the death of Germanicus is unknown; rather than continuing to stand trial when it became evident that the Senate was against him, Piso committed [[suicide]].<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#52 52]</ref><ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#15|III.15]]</ref>\n\nTiberius seems to have tired of politics at this point. In AD&nbsp;22, he shared his tribunician authority with his son Drusus,<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#56|III.56]]</ref> and began making yearly excursions to Campania that reportedly became longer and longer every year. In AD&nbsp;23, Drusus mysteriously died,<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'', [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#7|IV.7]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#8|IV.8]]</ref><ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#62 62]</ref> and Tiberius seems to have made no effort to elevate a replacement. Finally, in AD&nbsp;26, Tiberius retired from Rome to an Imperial villa-complex he had inherited from Augustus, on the island of [[Capri]]. It was just off the coast of Campania, which was a traditional holiday retreat for Rome's upper classes, particularly those who valued cultured leisure ([[otium]]) and a Hellenised lifestyle.<ref>\"We must imagine Tiberius not as brooding in isolation (though it is true enough he was a difficult man, not to say a grouchy one), but as entertaining visitors, discussing affairs, and taking up at least the more important of the obligations imposed upon him by state and family\": see p. 185ff ''in'' Houston, George W., \"Tiberius on Capri\", ''Greece and Rome'', Volume 32, No. 2 (Oct., 1985), pp. 179\u2013196, Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Classical Association, available at [[JSTOR]] (subscription required) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/642441]</ref><ref name=\"tacitus-annals-iv-67\">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#67|IV.67]]</ref>\n\n=== Tiberius in Capri, with Sejanus in Rome ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Tiberius NyCarlsberg01.jpg\n| width1 = 177\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 =\n| image2 = Tiberius (bust) 2.JPG\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 =\n| footer = Left: marble [[Roman portraiture|portrait bust]] of Tiberius in the [[Carlsberg Glyptotek]], Copenhagen <br>Right: bronze portrait bust of Tiberius in the [[Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles]], Paris\n}}\n[[Sejanus|Lucius Aelius Sejanus]] had served the imperial family for almost twenty years when he became [[Praetorian Prefect]] in AD&nbsp;15.

After Sejanus's fall, Tiberius' withdrawal from Rome was complete; the empire continued to run under the inertia of the bureaucracy established by Augustus, rather than through the leadership of the Princeps. Suetonius records that he became [[paranoia|paranoid]],<ref name=\"suetonius-twelve-caesars-60\" /> and spent a great deal of time brooding over the death of his son.

His withdrawn nature, especially in comparison with Augustus' openness, immediately made him a disliked figure. The Senate had been functioning under the directorship of the Principate for almost 50 years; most Senators had gained their position and hoped to advance further by courting Imperial favor. Tiberius's attempt to restore some share of administration to the Senate thus met with failure; the Senate no longer knew how to rule independent of the Princeps. Despite his excellence as a military commander and his long experience in affairs of state, Tiberius seemed uninterested in the role of Emperor, and his rule and his reputation suffered. The administration of the Imperial sector of the government increased during this time, but how much this is due to direct action by Tiberius rather than his freedmen advisers cannot be determined. In the end, Tiberius perhaps is a model of how power can be abused by its lack of use.-->\n\nTiberius' heir Caligula not only spent Tiberius' fortune of 2,700,000,000 [[sesterces]] but would also begin the chain of events which would bring about the downfall of the Julio-Claudian dynasty in <small>AD</small> 68.<ref>Caligula would kill [[Tiberius Gemellus]] and [[Antonia Minor]] before being killed by his own personal guard.

Of the authors whose texts have survived, only four describe the reign of Tiberius in considerable detail: [[Tacitus]], [[Suetonius]], [[Cassius Dio]] and [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]].

Tiberius himself wrote an autobiography which Suetonius describes as \"brief and sketchy\", but this book has been lost.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#61 61]</ref>\n\n==== Publius Cornelius Tacitus ====\n{{See also|Tacitus}}\n\nThe most detailed account of this period is handed down to us by [[Tacitus]], whose ''[[Annals]]'' dedicate the first six books entirely to the reign of Tiberius. Tacitus was a Roman senator, born during the reign of [[Nero]] in AD 56, and consul suffect in AD 97. His text is largely based on the ''[[Acta Senatus]]'' (the minutes of the session of the Senate) and the ''[[Acta Diurna]]'' (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital), as well as speeches by Tiberius himself, and the histories of contemporaries such as [[Marcus Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] (all of which are lost).<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-iv-6\" />\n\nTacitus' narrative emphasizes both political and psychological motivation. His characterisation of Tiberius throughout the first six books is mostly negative, and gradually worsens as his rule declines, identifying a clear breaking point with the death of his son [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus]] in AD 23.<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-iv-6\" />\n\nTacitus describes Julio-Claudian rule as generally unjust and \"criminal\";<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'', [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#6|I.6]]</ref> he attributes the apparent virtues of Tiberius during his early reign to hypocrisy.<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-vi-51\" />\nAnother major recurring theme concerns the balance of power between the Senate and the Emperors, [[political corruption|corruption]], and the growing [[tyranny]] among the governing classes of Rome. A substantial amount of his account on Tiberius is therefore devoted to the treason trials and persecutions following the revival of the ''maiestas'' law under Augustus.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#72|I.72]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#74|I.74]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#27|II.27\u201332]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#49|III.49\u201351]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#66|III.66\u201369]]</ref> Ultimately, Tacitus' opinion on Tiberius is best illustrated by his conclusion of the sixth book:\n\n{{quote|His character too had its distinct periods. It was a bright time in his life and reputation, while under Augustus he was a private citizen or held high offices; a time of reserve and crafty assumption of virtue, as long as Germanicus and Drusus were alive. Again, while his mother lived, he was a compound of good and evil; he was infamous for his cruelty, though he veiled his debaucheries, while he loved or feared Sejanus. Finally, he plunged into every wickedness and disgrace, when fear and shame being cast off, he simply indulged his own inclinations.<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-vi-51\" />}}\n\n==== Suetonius Tranquillus ====\n[[File:Silver denarius of Tiberius 14CE 37CE found in India Indian copy of a the same 1st century CE Coin of Kushan king Kujula Kadphises copying a coin of Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|An example of [[Indo-Roman trade and relations]] during the period: silver denarius of Tiberius (14\u201337) found in [[India]] and Indian copy of the same, 1st-century coin of [[Kushan]] king [[Kujula Kadphises]] copying a coin of [[Augustus]].]]\n[[Suetonius]] was an equestrian who held administrative posts during the reigns of [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]].

He succeeded his stepfather, [[Augustus]].\n\nBorn to [[Tiberius Claudius Nero (praetor 42 BC)|Tiberius Claudius Nero]] and [[Livia|Livia Drusilla]] in a [[Claudia (gens)|Claudian family]], he was given the [[personal name]] '''Tiberius Claudius Nero'''. His mother divorced Nero and married [[Augustus|Octavian]]\u2014later to ascend to Emperor as Augustus\u2014who officially became his [[stepfather]]. Tiberius would later marry Augustus' daughter (from his marriage to [[Scribonia (wife of Augustus)|Scribonia]]), [[Julia the Elder]], and even [[Adoption in ancient Rome|later be adopted]] by Augustus. Through the adoption, he officially became a [[Julia (gens)|Julian]], [[Roman naming conventions|assuming the name]] '''Tiberius Julius Caesar'''. The emperors after Tiberius would continue this blended dynasty of both families for the following thirty years; historians have named it the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. His relationship to the other emperors of this dynasty was as follows: he was the stepson of Augustus, grand-uncle of [[Caligula]], paternal uncle of [[Claudius]], and great-grand uncle of [[Nero]]. Tiberius' 22-and-a-half-year reign would be the longest after that of Augustus until that of Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]], who surpassed his reign by a few months.\n\nTiberius was one of the greatest [[Roman general]]s; his conquest of [[Pannonia]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Raetia]], and (temporarily) parts of [[Germania]] laid the foundations for the northern frontier. Even so, he came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive and sombre ruler who never really desired to be emperor; [[Pliny the Elder]] called him \"the gloomiest of men\".<ref>Pliny the Elder, ''Natural Histories'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/28*.html#v XXVIII.5.23]; Capes, [https://archive.org/details/romanhistoryear03capegoog/page/n99 p. 71]</ref> After the death of his son [[Drusus Julius Caesar]] in 23 AD, Tiberius became more reclusive and aloof. In 26 AD he removed himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his unscrupulous [[Praetorian prefect]]s [[Sejanus|Lucius Aelius Sejanus]] and [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Quintus Naevius Sutorius Macro]].

Historians generally agree that it is during this time that the question of Augustus' heir became most acute, and while Augustus had seemed to indicate that [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]] would carry on his position in the event of his death, the ambiguity of succession became Augustus' chief problem.<ref>[[#Southern|Southern]], pp. 119\u2013120.</ref>\n\nIn response, a series of potential heirs seem to have been selected, among them Tiberius and his brother Drusus.

As such, in 12&nbsp;BC he received military commissions in [[Pannonia]] and [[Germania]]; both areas highly volatile and of key importance to Augustan policy.\n\n[[File:Germania Enobarbo e Tiberio.jpg|thumb|350px|The campaigns of Tiberius, [[Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 16 BC)|Ahenobarbus]], and [[Gaius Sentius Saturninus|Saturninus]] in [[Germania]] between 6 BC and 1 BC]]\nIn 6 BC, Tiberius launched a [[pincer movement]] against the [[Marcomanni]]. Setting out northwest from [[Carnuntum]] on the Danube with four legions, Tiberius passed through [[Quadi]] territory in order to invade Marcomanni territory from the east. Meanwhile, general [[Gaius Sentius Saturninus]] would depart east from [[Moguntiacum]] on the [[Rhine]] with two or three legions, pass through newly annexed [[Hermunduri]] territory, and attack the Marcomanni from the west. The campaign was a resounding success, but Tiberius could not subjugate the Marcomanni because he was soon summoned to the Rhine frontier to protect Rome's new conquests in Germania.\n\nHe returned to Rome and was consul for a second time in 7&nbsp;BC, and in 6&nbsp;BC was granted [[tribune|tribunician power]] ''(tribunicia potestas)'' and control in the East,<ref name=\"cassius-dio-rhistory-lv-9\">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html#9 LV.9]</ref> all of which mirrored positions that Agrippa had previously held. However, despite these successes and despite his advancement, Tiberius was not happy.<ref>[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], p. 23.</ref>\n\n==Midlife (6 BC \u2013 14 AD)==\n=== Retirement to Rhodes (6 BC) ===\n[[File:SperlongaVillaTiberio.jpg|thumb|250px|Remnants of Tiberius' villa at [[Sperlonga]], on the coast midway between Rome and Naples]]\nIn 6&nbsp;BC, on the verge of accepting command in the East and becoming the second-most powerful man in Rome, Tiberius suddenly announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to [[Rhodes]].<ref>[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], pp. 23\u201324.</ref> The precise motives for Tiberius's withdrawal are unclear.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#10 10]</ref> Historians have speculated a connection with the fact that Augustus had adopted Julia's sons by Agrippa, [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] and [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]], and seemed to be moving them along the same political path that both Tiberius and Drusus had trodden.<ref>[[#Levick|Levick]], p. 29.</ref>\n\nTiberius' move thus seemed to be an interim solution: he would hold power only until his stepsons would come of age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, behavior of his unhappily married wife, Julia,<ref>Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#100 II.100]</ref> may have also played a part.<ref name=\"cassius-dio-rhistory-lv-9\" /> Indeed, [[Tacitus]] calls it Tiberius' ''intima causa'', his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred of Julia and a longing for Vipsania.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#53|I.53]]</ref> Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the [[Roman Forum]], and forbidden to see the woman he had loved.<ref name=sag26 />\n\nWhatever Tiberius' motives, the withdrawal was almost disastrous for Augustus' succession plans. Gaius and Lucius were still in their early teens, and Augustus, now 57 years old, had no immediate successor. There was no longer a guarantee of a peaceful transfer of power after Augustus' death, nor a guarantee that his family, and therefore his family's allies, would continue to hold power should the position of ''[[Princeps]]'' survive.<ref name=sag26>[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], p. 26.</ref>\n\nSomewhat apocryphal stories tell of Augustus pleading with Tiberius to stay, even going so far as to stage a serious illness.<ref name=\"sag26\" /> Tiberius' response was to anchor off the shore of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] until word came that Augustus had survived, then sailing straightway for Rhodes.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#11 11]</ref> Tiberius reportedly regretted his departure and requested to return to Rome several times, but each time Augustus refused his requests.<ref>[[#Seager2005|Seager 2005]], p. 28.</ref>\n\n=== Heir to Augustus ===\nWith Tiberius' departure, succession rested solely on Augustus' two young grandsons, Lucius and Gaius Caesar.

Tiberius was adopted as full son and heir, and in turn he was required to adopt his nephew [[Germanicus]], the son of his brother Drusus and Augustus' niece [[Antonia Minor]].<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-i-3\" /><ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html#13 LV.13]</ref> Along with his adoption, Tiberius received tribunician power as well as a share of Augustus' ''maius imperium'', something that even Marcus Agrippa may never have had.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#21 21].

He seems to have wished for the Senate and the state to simply act without him and his direct orders were rather vague, inspiring debate more on what he actually meant than on passing his legislation.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#32|III.32]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#52|III.52]]</ref> In his first few years, Tiberius seemed to have wanted the Senate to act on its own,<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#35|III.35]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#53|III.53]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#54|III.54]]</ref> rather than as a servant to his will as it had been under Augustus. According to Tacitus, Tiberius derided the Senate as \"men fit to be slaves\".<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#65|III.65]]</ref>\n\n=== Rise and fall of Germanicus ===\n[[File:Germanicus.jpg|thumb|200px|A bust of the adopted son of Tiberius, [[Germanicus]], from the [[Louvre]], [[Paris]].]]\n\nProblems arose quickly for the new Princeps. The Roman legions posted in Pannonia and in Germania had not been paid the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and after a short period of time mutinied when it was clear that a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#16|I.16]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#17|I.17]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#31|I.31]]</ref> [[Germanicus]] and Tiberius's son, [[Drusus Julius Caesar]], were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line.<ref name=\"LVII.6\">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/57*.html#6 LVII.6]</ref>\n\nRather than simply quell the mutiny, however, Germanicus rallied the mutineers and led them on a short campaign across the Rhine into Germanic territory, stating that whatever treasure they could grab would count as their bonus.<ref name=\"LVII.6\"/> Germanicus's forces crossed the Rhine and quickly occupied all of the territory between the Rhine and the [[Elbe]]. Additionally, Tacitus records the capture of the [[Teutoburg forest]] and the reclaiming of Roman [[aquila (Roman)|standards]] lost years before by [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]],<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-ii-41\">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#41|II.41]]</ref> when three Roman legions and their auxiliary cohorts [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|had been ambushed]] by Germanic tribes.<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-ii-46\">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#46|II.46]]</ref>\n\nGermanicus had managed to deal a significant blow to Rome's enemies, quell an uprising of troops, and returned lost standards to Rome, actions that increased the fame and legend of the already very popular Germanicus with the Roman people.<ref>Shotter, 35\u201337.</ref>\n\nAfter being recalled from Germania,<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#26|II.26]]</ref> Germanicus celebrated a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in Rome in AD&nbsp;17,<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-ii-41\" /> the first full triumph that the city had seen since Augustus' own in 29&nbsp;BC. As a result, in AD&nbsp;18 Germanicus was granted control over the eastern part of the empire, just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before, and was clearly the successor to Tiberius.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#43|II.43]]</ref> Germanicus survived a little over a year before dying, accusing [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]], the governor of [[Syria]], of poisoning him.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#71|II.71]]</ref>\n\nThe Pisones had been longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with the young Octavian after his marriage to Livia, the mother of Tiberius. Germanicus's death and accusations indicted the new Princeps. Piso was placed on trial and, according to Tacitus, threatened to implicate Tiberius.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#16|III.16]]</ref> Whether the governor actually could connect the Princeps to the death of Germanicus is unknown; rather than continuing to stand trial when it became evident that the Senate was against him, Piso committed [[suicide]].<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#52 52]</ref><ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#15|III.15]]</ref>\n\nTiberius seems to have tired of politics at this point. In AD&nbsp;22, he shared his tribunician authority with his son Drusus,<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#56|III.56]]</ref> and began making yearly excursions to Campania that reportedly became longer and longer every year. In AD&nbsp;23, Drusus mysteriously died,<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'', [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#7|IV.7]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#8|IV.8]]</ref><ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#62 62]</ref> and Tiberius seems to have made no effort to elevate a replacement. Finally, in AD&nbsp;26, Tiberius retired from Rome to an Imperial villa-complex he had inherited from Augustus, on the island of [[Capri]]. It was just off the coast of Campania, which was a traditional holiday retreat for Rome's upper classes, particularly those who valued cultured leisure ([[otium]]) and a Hellenised lifestyle.<ref>\"We must imagine Tiberius not as brooding in isolation (though it is true enough he was a difficult man, not to say a grouchy one), but as entertaining visitors, discussing affairs, and taking up at least the more important of the obligations imposed upon him by state and family\": see p. 185ff ''in'' Houston, George W., \"Tiberius on Capri\", ''Greece and Rome'', Volume 32, No. 2 (Oct., 1985), pp. 179\u2013196, Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Classical Association, available at [[JSTOR]] (subscription required) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/642441]</ref><ref name=\"tacitus-annals-iv-67\">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#67|IV.67]]</ref>\n\n=== Tiberius in Capri, with Sejanus in Rome ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Tiberius NyCarlsberg01.jpg\n| width1 = 177\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 =\n| image2 = Tiberius (bust) 2.JPG\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 =\n| footer = Left: marble [[Roman portraiture|portrait bust]] of Tiberius in the [[Carlsberg Glyptotek]], Copenhagen <br>Right: bronze portrait bust of Tiberius in the [[Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles]], Paris\n}}\n[[Sejanus|Lucius Aelius Sejanus]] had served the imperial family for almost twenty years when he became [[Praetorian Prefect]] in AD&nbsp;15.

In AD&nbsp;17 or 18, Tiberius had trimmed the ranks of the [[Praetorian Guard]] responsible for the defense of the city, and had moved it from encampments outside of the city walls [[Castra Praetoria|into the city itself]],<ref name=\"suetonius-tiberius-37\">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#37 37]</ref> giving Sejanus access to somewhere between 6000 and 9000 troops.\n\nThe death of Drusus elevated Sejanus, at least in Tiberius's eyes, who thereafter refers to him as his 'Socius Laborum' (Partner of my labours).

Finally, with Tiberius's withdrawal in AD&nbsp;26, Sejanus was left in charge of the entire state mechanism and the city of Rome.<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-iv-67\" />\n\nSejanus's position was not quite that of successor; he had requested marriage in AD&nbsp;25 to Tiberius's niece, [[Livilla]],<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#39|IV.39]]</ref> though under pressure quickly withdrew the request.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#40|IV.40]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#41|IV.41]]</ref> While Sejanus's Praetorians controlled the imperial post, and therefore the information that Tiberius received from Rome and the information Rome received from Tiberius,<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#41|IV.41]]</ref> the presence of [[Livia]] seems to have checked his overt power for a time. Her death in AD&nbsp;29 changed all that.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 5#3|V.3]]</ref>\n\nSejanus began a series of purge trials of Senators and wealthy equestrians in the city of Rome, removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial (and his own) treasury. Germanicus's widow [[Agrippina the Elder]] and two of her sons, [[Nero Julius Caesar]] and [[Drusus Caesar]] were arrested and exiled in AD&nbsp;30 and later all died in suspicious circumstances.

Precisely what happened is difficult to determine, but Sejanus seems to have covertly attempted to court those families who were tied to the Julians, and attempted to ingratiate himself with the Julian family line with an eye toward placing himself, as an adopted Julian, in the position of Princeps, or as a possible regent.<ref name=\"suetonius-tiberius-65\" /> [[Livilla]] was later implicated in this plot, and was revealed to have been Sejanus's lover for a number of years.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/57*.html#22 LVII.22]</ref>\n\nThe plot seems to have involved the two of them overthrowing Tiberius, with the support of the Julians, and either assuming the [[Principate]] themselves, or serving as regent to the young [[Tiberius Gemellus]] or possibly even [[Caligula]].<ref name=\"boddington-sejanus\">{{cite journal |last=Boddington |first=Ann |title=Sejanus.

After Sejanus's fall, Tiberius' withdrawal from Rome was complete; the empire continued to run under the inertia of the bureaucracy established by Augustus, rather than through the leadership of the Princeps. Suetonius records that he became [[paranoia|paranoid]],<ref name=\"suetonius-twelve-caesars-60\" /> and spent a great deal of time brooding over the death of his son. Meanwhile, during this period a short invasion by Parthia, incursions by tribes from [[Dacia]] and from across the Rhine by several Germanic tribes occurred.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#41 41]</ref>\n\nLittle was done to either secure his [[Order of succession|succession]] or indicate how it was to take place; the Julians and their supporters had fallen to the wrath of Sejanus, and his own sons and immediate family were dead. Two of the candidates were either [[Caligula]], the sole surviving son of Germanicus, or Tiberius' own grandson, [[Tiberius Gemellus]].<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#46|VI.46]]</ref> However, only a half-hearted attempt at the end of Tiberius' life was made to make Caligula a [[quaestor]], and thus give him some credibility as a possible successor, while Gemellus himself was still only a teenager and thus completely unsuitable for some years to come.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/57*.html#23 LVII.23]</ref>\n\n==== Death (37 AD) ====\nTiberius died in [[Misenum]] on 16 March AD&nbsp;37, a few months shy of his 78th birthday.<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-vi-51\">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#50|VI.50]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#51|VI.51]]</ref><ref>Karen Cokayne, Experiencing Old Age In Ancient Rome, p.100</ref><ref>Flavius Josephus, Steve Mason, Translation and Commentary.

His withdrawn nature, especially in comparison with Augustus' openness, immediately made him a disliked figure. The Senate had been functioning under the directorship of the Principate for almost 50 years; most Senators had gained their position and hoped to advance further by courting Imperial favor. Tiberius's attempt to restore some share of administration to the Senate thus met with failure; the Senate no longer knew how to rule independent of the Princeps. Despite his excellence as a military commander and his long experience in affairs of state, Tiberius seemed uninterested in the role of Emperor, and his rule and his reputation suffered. The administration of the Imperial sector of the government increased during this time, but how much this is due to direct action by Tiberius rather than his freedmen advisers cannot be determined. In the end, Tiberius perhaps is a model of how power can be abused by its lack of use.-->\n\nTiberius' heir Caligula not only spent Tiberius' fortune of 2,700,000,000 [[sesterces]] but would also begin the chain of events which would bring about the downfall of the Julio-Claudian dynasty in <small>AD</small> 68.<ref>Caligula would kill [[Tiberius Gemellus]] and [[Antonia Minor]] before being killed by his own personal guard.

Of the authors whose texts have survived, only four describe the reign of Tiberius in considerable detail: [[Tacitus]], [[Suetonius]], [[Cassius Dio]] and [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]]. Fragmentary evidence also remains from [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Strabo]] and [[Seneca the Elder]]. Tiberius himself wrote an autobiography which Suetonius describes as \"brief and sketchy\", but this book has been lost.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#61 61]</ref>\n\n==== Publius Cornelius Tacitus ====\n{{See also|Tacitus}}\n\nThe most detailed account of this period is handed down to us by [[Tacitus]], whose ''[[Annals]]'' dedicate the first six books entirely to the reign of Tiberius. Tacitus was a Roman senator, born during the reign of [[Nero]] in AD 56, and consul suffect in AD 97. His text is largely based on the ''[[Acta Senatus]]'' (the minutes of the session of the Senate) and the ''[[Acta Diurna]]'' (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital), as well as speeches by Tiberius himself, and the histories of contemporaries such as [[Marcus Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] (all of which are lost).<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-iv-6\" />\n\nTacitus' narrative emphasizes both political and psychological motivation. His characterisation of Tiberius throughout the first six books is mostly negative, and gradually worsens as his rule declines, identifying a clear breaking point with the death of his son [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus]] in AD 23.<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-iv-6\" />\n\nTacitus describes Julio-Claudian rule as generally unjust and \"criminal\";<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'', [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#6|I.6]]</ref> he attributes the apparent virtues of Tiberius during his early reign to hypocrisy.<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-vi-51\" />\nAnother major recurring theme concerns the balance of power between the Senate and the Emperors, [[political corruption|corruption]], and the growing [[tyranny]] among the governing classes of Rome. A substantial amount of his account on Tiberius is therefore devoted to the treason trials and persecutions following the revival of the ''maiestas'' law under Augustus.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#72|I.72]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#74|I.74]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#27|II.27\u201332]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#49|III.49\u201351]], [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#66|III.66\u201369]]</ref> Ultimately, Tacitus' opinion on Tiberius is best illustrated by his conclusion of the sixth book:\n\n{{quote|His character too had its distinct periods. It was a bright time in his life and reputation, while under Augustus he was a private citizen or held high offices; a time of reserve and crafty assumption of virtue, as long as Germanicus and Drusus were alive. Again, while his mother lived, he was a compound of good and evil; he was infamous for his cruelty, though he veiled his debaucheries, while he loved or feared Sejanus. Finally, he plunged into every wickedness and disgrace, when fear and shame being cast off, he simply indulged his own inclinations.<ref name=\"tacitus-annals-vi-51\" />}}\n\n==== Suetonius Tranquillus ====\n[[File:Silver denarius of Tiberius 14CE 37CE found in India Indian copy of a the same 1st century CE Coin of Kushan king Kujula Kadphises copying a coin of Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|An example of [[Indo-Roman trade and relations]] during the period: silver denarius of Tiberius (14\u201337) found in [[India]] and Indian copy of the same, 1st-century coin of [[Kushan]] king [[Kujula Kadphises]] copying a coin of [[Augustus]].]]\n[[Suetonius]] was an equestrian who held administrative posts during the reigns of [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]].
