The DOE Office of Biological and Environmental Research funds and oversees its research and operations.\n\n==Research==\nEMSL scientists and collaborators perform fundamental research that focuses on the biological, biogeochemical, and physical principles to predict processes occurring at the molecular and genomics-controlled smallest scales to the environmental Earth system changes at the largest scales.\n[[File:Web Size-BrownRot-28.jpg|thumb|left|A biologist is preparing an RNA sample to understand how brown rot fungi degrades wood.]]\n\nEMSL uses six Integrated Research Platforms to uncover critical information for understanding and predicting the molecular functions of biological and ecosystem processes.\n\n* '''Functional Omics''' integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses to uncover biological processes in plant, fungal, and microbial systems.\n* '''Isotope and Chemical Analysis''' tracks the fate of isotopes and analyzes the chemistry of biological and environmental systems.\n* '''Molecular Bioimaging''' provides images of the structure and location of proteins and other biomolecules at nanoscale spatial and temporal resolutions.\n* Biogeochemical Transformation investigates how molecular interactions at the Earth\u2019s land, water, and air interfaces transform and transport nutrients and contaminants within the environment.\n* '''Cellular Dynamics''' uncovers the molecular signals within and between cells as they respond to their environment and other organisms.\n* '''Molecular Plant Phenotyping''' probes the interaction between genes and the environment to understand, predict, and control plant traits.\n\n\n\n==Operations==\n\nEMSL is a user research facility whereby scientists, from around the world, can submit project proposals to access the laboratory\u2019s experts and equipment at no cost. Proposals are screened through a competitive peer-review process to ensure the project is scientifically impactful and relevant to DOE's Office of Biological and Environmental Research mission.\n\nScientists whose proposals are accepted are referred to as \u201cEMSL users.\u201d Typical user research projects can last a few months to a few years. EMSL users do not have to stay on-site for the duration of their project and can visit the laboratory when needed. Much of the sample processing and analysis can be handled remotely.\n\nEMSL's user community provides the laboratory\u2019s management team with recommendations for scientific direction and efficient operations through an elected committee of representatives.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== The beginnings (1986\u20131997) ===\n\nThe idea that would become EMSL began in 1985 with a National Academy of Sciences report titled ''Opportunities in Chemistry''. The report identified scientific challenges relating to energy and the environment that required fundamental research to achieve a solution. In response, then director of PNNL, William R. Wiley, and lab senior managers proposed a center for molecular science that would bring together theoreticians with experience in computing, modeling of molecular processes, and researchers from the physical and life sciences. Their recommendations would become EMSL, a center with advanced instrumentation for the study of molecular-level chemistry.\n\nWiley envisioned a facility where the research was conducted in an integrated and collaborative manner. \u201cProblems don\u2019t come in small, unique, compartmentalized packages. We must recognize the interrelationships,\u201d said Wiley.\n\nOhio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, which operates PNNL for DOE, approved $8.5 million in funding over four years to build the facility; develop research programs; and obtain the equipment, facilities, scientists, and staff to support these programs.\n\nPNNL began construction of the facility in July 1994 and completed the laboratory in August 1997. EMSL opened October 1, 1997, for full operation as DOE's newest national scientific user facility.\n\n=== The early years (1997\u20132001) ===\n\nDuring its first five years, EMSL operations focused on building capabilities, recruiting scientific leadership, and attracting users. The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and carbon dioxide reduction in the atmosphere \u2013 critical challenges important to DOE.\n\nEMSL's early user program focused on single investigator studies \u2013 particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries \u2013 and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.\n\n=== A maturing program (2001\u20132009) ===\n\nDuring this period, EMSL focused on two grand challenges:\n\n* a biogeochemistry question concerning the fundamental interaction between microbes and minerals, and\n* a study addressing the structure and function of proteins in the cell membrane.\n\nWork on these challenges led to new opportunities for the scientific community \u2013 with research campaigns designed to focus teams on a single challenge. \n\nIn January 2007, EMSL celebrated its first permanent expansion: a nearly 4,000-square-foot raised floor within its high-performance computing operations center for an 11.8-teraflop supercomputer named Chinook, which was then the fifth-fastest system in the world. In April 2008, EMSL dedicated a new office pod to distinguished user J. Mike White that houses nearly 100 staff and users. In early 2012, EMSL opened its Quiet Wing housing a suite of ultra- sensitive high-resolution microscopy and scanning instruments.\n\n=== Building for the future (2009 to present) ===\n\n[[File:Web Size-SynBio Fungi-5.jpg|thumb|right|A biologist is studying natural bioproducts using traditional genetics and synthetic biology. ]]\nIn October 2010, EMSL\u2019s premier computational chemistry software package,  NWChem, went open source \u2013 allowing computer scientists worldwide to contribute to its future development and making it available to more researchers and students. The code has been cited over 3760 times (according to a Web of Science search in 2020) since 2010.\n\nIn June 2013, EMSL retired the Chinook supercomputer and welcomed Cascade, a 3.4-petaflops system.\n\nEMSL celebrated its twentieth anniversary in August 2017, showcasing NWChem computational chemistry software, and advances in subsurface science and foundational biofuel production. Scientific leaders participated in the event, including internationally recognized scientists Thom Dunning, Steve Colson, and Jean Futrell.\n\nToday EMSL focuses its scientific discovery research in Functional and Systems Biology and Environmental Transformations and Interactions, together with users from diverse scientific communities.

Since its formation and the introduction of a [[multi-party system]], the DPS has played a dominant role in Montenegrin politics, forming the backbone of every coalition government to date.\n\nAt the [[2012 Montenegrin parliamentary election|2012 legislative elections]] held on 14 October, the DPS along with the [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro]] (SDP) as the [[Coalition for a European Montenegro]] won 39 out of 81 seats. This coalition, along with its longtime partner the [[Bosniak Party]], once again formed a majority in the [[Parliament of Montenegro]] and held the right to appoint the [[Government of Montenegro|Government]]. The DPS itself won 31 seats. The current [[Prime Minister of Montenegro]] [[Du\u0161ko Markovi\u0107]] and [[President of Montenegro|President]] [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] are both members of the party.\n\nThe DPS is internationally affiliated with the [[Socialist International]] and [[Progressive Alliance]], and is an associate affiliate of the [[Party of European Socialists]].\n\n==Ideology==\nThe party evolved from the [[League of Communists of Montenegro]] as a reformist force after Yugoslavia's dissolution. In the 1990s, party was based on [[democratic socialism]], [[social democracy]] and [[Serbian\u2013Montenegrin unionism]]. In the 2000s, the party switched policy towards a common state with Serbia and would become the main proponent of the independence of Montenegro in 2006. Today's party is characterized by [[Populism|populist]]<ref name=\"Dzankic\" /> [[big tent]] politics with a slight [[centre-left]]<ref name=\"N1info\" /> lean, alongside elements of [[nationalism]], a [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-western]] stance towards [[European integration]],<ref name=\"Nordsieck\" /> and some [[Third Way]] economics.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nThe history of the DPS begins with the political turmoil in Yugoslavia in the late 1980s. After [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] seized power in the [[League of Communists of Serbia]], he went on to organize rallies that eventually ousted the leaderships of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] local branches in [[League of Communists of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], [[League of Communists of Kosovo|Kosovo]] and Montenegro. This series of events, collectively known as the [[Anti-bureaucratic revolution]], swept into power new party leadership in Montenegro, one allied with Milo\u0161evi\u0107, personified in [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]], [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] and [[Svetozar Marovi\u0107]].\n\nThe League of Communists of Montenegro, under this new leadership, won by a landslide in the first [[1990 Montenegrin general election|relatively free multi-party election]] in Socialist Montenegro, held in December 1990, taking 83 out of 125 seats in the [[Parliament of Montenegro|Montenegrin parliament]]. The party had a significant [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] in the elections, as it had the entire established party structure at its disposal, while newly formed competition had to start from scratch. The party changed its name to the Democratic Party of Socialists on 22 June 1991.\n\nWith Bulatovi\u0107 as the president, the DPS closely aligned Montenegro with Serbia and the policies of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. The party was firmly in power during the turbulent early 1990s, which saw the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]] and the beginning of the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. During these years, the party endorsed a union and close relations with Serbia (its sole partner in the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] from 1992). The party maintained the support of the electorate in this difficult period for Montenegro, winning both the [[Montenegrin general election, 1992\u201393|1992]] and [[1996 Montenegrin parliamentary election|1996 elections]].\n\n===1997 split between Bulatovi\u0107 and \u0110ukanovi\u0107===\nOn July 11, 1997, the party's national committee (\"''Glavni odbor''\", abbreviated as \"''GO''\") held a closed doors session after which the committee selected [[Milica Pejanovi\u0107-\u0110uri\u0161i\u0107]] to replace Bulatovi\u0107 as the party president.<ref name=\"NR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nedeljnik.rs/nedeljnik/portalnews/dve-decenije-od-sednice-na-kojoj-se-pocepao-dps-kako-su-se-razveli-milo-i-bulatovic|work=[[Nedeljnik]]|title=''Kako su se \"razveli\" Milo i Momir: Dve decenije od sednice na kojoj se pocepao DPS''|language=Serbian|date=July 11, 2017|accessdate=February 14, 2019}}</ref> The party split had enormous implications, making a political confrontation between \u0110ukanovi\u0107 and Bulatovi\u0107 inevitable. This manifested in the [[1997 Montenegrin presidential election]] held in October, which \u0110ukanovi\u0107 won by a thin margin.\n\nBulatovi\u0107 went on to form the [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro]] (SNP) out of his defeated DPS faction, whose platform held a [[Serbian\u2013Montenegrin unionism|unionist position on the question of Yugoslavia]] and its short-lived successor state, Serbia and Montenegro. Meanwhile, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 became a fierce opponent of Milo\u0161evi\u0107. As a result of \u0110ukanovi\u0107's relationship with the United States, Montenegro received significant amounts of economic aid during this period, and negotiated limitations on [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombings of its territory in 1999]], whereas the rest of Yugoslavia was subject to significantly heavier attacks. The DPS government gradually severed ties with Serbia by taking control over customs and the economy, introducing first the [[German mark]], and subsequently the [[Euro]] as legal tender, and generally reducing the influence of the federal government in Montenegro.\n\n===Montenegrin independence===\nFollowing the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] on 5 October 2000, the DPS showed signs of greater support for Montenegrin independence. The campaign for the [[2002 Montenegrin parliamentary election|2002 parliamentary elections]] was devoted to the question of Montenegro's independence. However [[European Union|EU]] mediated negotiations between the DPS and the newly elected [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia|democratic government in Serbia]] in 2003 imposed a three-year waiting period before an independence referendum could be held. The transitional period saw the transformation of the FR Yugoslavia to a loose union called [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. During the existence of the union state, the party congress added the goal of a \"democratic, internationally-recognized, independent Montenegro\" to its official platform.<ref name=\"Vijesti\">{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/politika/dps-na-kongresu-mijenja-program|author=Samir Kajo\u0161evi\u0107|newspaper=[[Vijesti]]|title=''DPS na kongresu mijenja program''|language=Serbian|date=January 22, 2015|accessdate=March 23, 2019}}</ref> The party then spearheaded the pro-independence campaign ahead of [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|Montenegro's referendum in 2006]]. With 55.5% of voters opting for independence, Montenegro became an independent state on 3 June 2006.\n\n===Post-referendum era===\nIn 2006 at the [[2006 Montenegrin parliamentary election|first parliamentary elections]] in independent [[Montenegro]], as well as the subsequent [[2009 Montenegrin parliamentary election|elections in 2009]] and [[2012 Montenegrin parliamentary election|2012]], the DPS confirmed its position as the strongest political party in Montenegro. The party has formed the basis of all parliamentary majorities and has been the backbone of all Government cabinets since independence, usually with its now traditional ally the [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro]] (SDP) and ethnic minority parties.\n\nParty vice president [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] is incumbent [[President of Montenegro]], currently serving his third term, having won presidential elections in [[May 2003 Montenegrin presidential election|2003]], [[2008 Montenegrin presidential election|2008]] and [[2013 Montenegrin presidential election|2013]].\n\nMilo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 remains the party president and its undisputed authority, serving either as [[Prime Minister of Montenegro|Prime Minister]] or President of Montenegro from 1991 to 2006, 2008 to 2010 and 2012 to 2016. In 2006, the party leadership chose [[\u017deljko \u0160turanovi\u0107]], former Minister of Justice, to succeed \u0110ukanovi\u0107 as Prime Minister, until his resignation on 31 January 2008 for health reasons, whereupon \u0110ukanovi\u0107 replaced him, only to resign again in December 2010 while retaining his role as DPS party leader.<ref name=\"The end of an era, possibly\"/> After winning the [[2012 Montenegrin parliamentary election|2012 parliamentary elections]], \u0110ukanovi\u0107 once again assumed the position of Prime Minister.\n\n==Presidents of Democratic Party of Socialists==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\n|--\n! #\n! colspan=\"2\"| President\n!

Since its formation and the introduction of a [[multi-party system]], the DPS has played a dominant role in Montenegrin politics, forming the backbone of every coalition government to date.\n\nAt the [[2012 Montenegrin parliamentary election|2012 legislative elections]] held on 14 October, the DPS along with the [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro]] (SDP) as the [[Coalition for a European Montenegro]] won 39 out of 81 seats. This coalition, along with its longtime partner the [[Bosniak Party]], once again formed a majority in the [[Parliament of Montenegro]] and held the right to appoint the [[Government of Montenegro|Government]]. The DPS itself won 31 seats. The current [[Prime Minister of Montenegro]] [[Du\u0161ko Markovi\u0107]] and [[President of Montenegro|President]] [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] are both members of the party.\n\nThe DPS is internationally affiliated with the [[Socialist International]] and [[Progressive Alliance]], and is an associate affiliate of the [[Party of European Socialists]].\n\n==Ideology==\nThe party evolved from the [[League of Communists of Montenegro]] as a reformist force after Yugoslavia's dissolution. In the 1990s, party was based on [[democratic socialism]], [[social democracy]] and [[Serbian\u2013Montenegrin unionism]]. In the 2000s, the party switched policy towards a common state with Serbia and would become the main proponent of the independence of Montenegro in 2006. Today's party is characterized by [[Populism|populist]]<ref name=\"Dzankic\" /> [[big tent]] politics with a slight [[centre-left]]<ref name=\"N1info\" /> lean, alongside elements of [[nationalism]], a [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-western]] stance towards [[European integration]],<ref name=\"Nordsieck\" /> and some [[Third Way]] economics.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nThe history of the DPS begins with the political turmoil in Yugoslavia in the late 1980s. After [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] seized power in the [[League of Communists of Serbia]], he went on to organize rallies that eventually ousted the leaderships of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] local branches in [[League of Communists of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], [[League of Communists of Kosovo|Kosovo]] and Montenegro. This series of events, collectively known as the [[Anti-bureaucratic revolution]], swept into power new party leadership in Montenegro, one allied with Milo\u0161evi\u0107, personified in [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]], [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] and [[Svetozar Marovi\u0107]].\n\nThe League of Communists of Montenegro, under this new leadership, won by a landslide in the first [[1990 Montenegrin general election|relatively free multi-party election]] in Socialist Montenegro, held in December 1990, taking 83 out of 125 seats in the [[Parliament of Montenegro|Montenegrin parliament]]. The party had a significant [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] in the elections, as it had the entire established party structure at its disposal, while newly formed competition had to start from scratch. The party changed its name to the Democratic Party of Socialists on 22 June 1991.\n\nWith Bulatovi\u0107 as the president, the DPS closely aligned Montenegro with Serbia and the policies of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. The party was firmly in power during the turbulent early 1990s, which saw the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]] and the beginning of the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. During these years, the party endorsed a union and close relations with Serbia (its sole partner in the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] from 1992). The party maintained the support of the electorate in this difficult period for Montenegro, winning both the [[Montenegrin general election, 1992\u201393|1992]] and [[1996 Montenegrin parliamentary election|1996 elections]].\n\n===1997 split between Bulatovi\u0107 and \u0110ukanovi\u0107===\nOn July 11, 1997, the party's national committee (\"''Glavni odbor''\", abbreviated as \"''GO''\") held a closed doors session after which the committee selected [[Milica Pejanovi\u0107-\u0110uri\u0161i\u0107]] to replace Bulatovi\u0107 as the party president.<ref name=\"NR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nedeljnik.rs/nedeljnik/portalnews/dve-decenije-od-sednice-na-kojoj-se-pocepao-dps-kako-su-se-razveli-milo-i-bulatovic|work=[[Nedeljnik]]|title=''Kako su se \"razveli\" Milo i Momir: Dve decenije od sednice na kojoj se pocepao DPS''|language=Serbian|date=July 11, 2017|accessdate=February 14, 2019}}</ref> The party split had enormous implications, making a political confrontation between \u0110ukanovi\u0107 and Bulatovi\u0107 inevitable. This manifested in the [[1997 Montenegrin presidential election]] held in October, which \u0110ukanovi\u0107 won by a thin margin.\n\nBulatovi\u0107 went on to form the [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro]] (SNP) out of his defeated DPS faction, whose platform held a [[Serbian\u2013Montenegrin unionism|unionist position on the question of Yugoslavia]] and its short-lived successor state, Serbia and Montenegro. Meanwhile, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 became a fierce opponent of Milo\u0161evi\u0107. As a result of \u0110ukanovi\u0107's relationship with the United States, Montenegro received significant amounts of economic aid during this period, and negotiated limitations on [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombings of its territory in 1999]], whereas the rest of Yugoslavia was subject to significantly heavier attacks. The DPS government gradually severed ties with Serbia by taking control over customs and the economy, introducing first the [[German mark]], and subsequently the [[Euro]] as legal tender, and generally reducing the influence of the federal government in Montenegro.\n\n===Montenegrin independence===\nFollowing the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] on 5 October 2000, the DPS showed signs of greater support for Montenegrin independence. The campaign for the [[2002 Montenegrin parliamentary election|2002 parliamentary elections]] was devoted to the question of Montenegro's independence. However [[European Union|EU]] mediated negotiations between the DPS and the newly elected [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia|democratic government in Serbia]] in 2003 imposed a three-year waiting period before an independence referendum could be held. The transitional period saw the transformation of the FR Yugoslavia to a loose union called [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. During the existence of the union state, the party congress added the goal of a \"democratic, internationally-recognized, independent Montenegro\" to its official platform.<ref name=\"Vijesti\">{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/politika/dps-na-kongresu-mijenja-program|author=Samir Kajo\u0161evi\u0107|newspaper=[[Vijesti]]|title=''DPS na kongresu mijenja program''|language=Serbian|date=January 22, 2015|accessdate=March 23, 2019}}</ref> The party then spearheaded the pro-independence campaign ahead of [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|Montenegro's referendum in 2006]]. With 55.5% of voters opting for independence, Montenegro became an independent state on 3 June 2006.\n\n===Post-referendum era===\nIn 2006 at the [[2006 Montenegrin parliamentary election|first parliamentary elections]] in independent [[Montenegro]], as well as the subsequent [[2009 Montenegrin parliamentary election|elections in 2009]] and [[2012 Montenegrin parliamentary election|2012]], the DPS confirmed its position as the strongest political party in Montenegro. The party has formed the basis of all parliamentary majorities and has been the backbone of all Government cabinets since independence, usually with its now traditional ally the [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro]] (SDP) and ethnic minority parties.\n\nParty vice president [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] is incumbent [[President of Montenegro]], currently serving his third term, having won presidential elections in [[May 2003 Montenegrin presidential election|2003]], [[2008 Montenegrin presidential election|2008]] and [[2013 Montenegrin presidential election|2013]].\n\nMilo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 remains the party president and its undisputed authority, serving either as [[Prime Minister of Montenegro|Prime Minister]] or President of Montenegro from 1991 to 2006, 2008 to 2010 and 2012 to 2016. In 2006, the party leadership chose [[\u017deljko \u0160turanovi\u0107]], former Minister of Justice, to succeed \u0110ukanovi\u0107 as Prime Minister, until his resignation on 31 January 2008 for health reasons, whereupon \u0110ukanovi\u0107 replaced him, only to resign again in December 2010 while retaining his role as DPS party leader.<ref name=\"The end of an era, possibly\"/> After winning the [[2012 Montenegrin parliamentary election|2012 parliamentary elections]], \u0110ukanovi\u0107 once again assumed the position of Prime Minister.\n\n==Presidents of Democratic Party of Socialists==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\n|--\n! #\n! colspan=\"2\"| President\n!
