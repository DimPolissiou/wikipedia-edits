Unlike young Americans, young Syrians find leaving their family unnecessary to set up their independence because Syrian society, just like [[Southwest Asia]], [[North Africa]] and the wider Eastern world, places great emphasis on the group rather than the individual. In the West the individual is key and the group is secondary. Respect and social status are important in Syrian societies.

''[[Baba ghanoush]]'', or eggplant spreads, is also a dish made by Syrians. Popular Syrian salads include ''[[tabbouleh]]'' and ''[[fattoush]]''. The Syrian cuisine includes other dishes like stuffed [[zucchini]] (''mahshe''), [[dolma]], [[kebab]], ''[[kibbeh]]'', ''[[kibbeh nayyeh]]'', ''[[mujaddara]]'', [[shawarma]], and ''[[shanklish]]''. Syrians often serve selections of appetizers, known as ''[[meze]]'', before the main course. ''[[Za'atar]]'', [[minced beef]], and cheese [[manakish]] are popular [[hors d'\u0153uvre]]. Syrians are also well known for their [[Syrian cheese|cheese]]. A popular Syrian drink is the [[Arak (distilled beverage)|''arak'' beverage]].

Syrian music is characterized by an emphasis on [[melody]] and [[rhythm]], as opposed to [[harmony]]. There are some genres of Syrian music that are [[polyphony|polyphonic]], but typically, most Syrian and Arabic music is [[homophony|homophonic]]. Syrian music is also characterized by the predominance of vocal music.

Ethnic dance performers wear a ''shirwal'', which are loose, baggy pants with an elastic waist. Some Muslim Syrian women wear a ''[[hijab]]'', which is a [[headscarf]] worn by Muslim and orthodox Christian women to cover their [[hair]].  There are [[Sartorial hijab|various styles]] of ''hijab''.\n\n=== Holidays ===\nSyrian Americans celebrate many religious holidays, with Christian Syrian Americans celebrating most of the [[Liturgical year|Christian holidays]] that are already celebrated in the United States, but in addition to a few others or at different times. For example, They celebrate [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]], but since most Syrians are Eastern Orthodox, they celebrate Easter on a different Sunday from most other Americans, and various Saints' days.\n\nSyrian American Jews celebrate the [[Jewish holiday]]s, such as [[Rosh Hashanah]], [[Yom Kippur]], [[Sukkot]], [[Purim]], [[Passover]] and [[Shavuot]].

[[Ramadan]] is the ninth month of the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic year]], during which Muslims fast from dawn to sunset; Muslims resort to self-discipline to cleanse themselves spiritually. After Ramadan is over, Muslims celebrate [[Eid ul-Fitr]], when Muslims break their fasting and revel exuberantly. Muslims also celebrate [[Eid ul-Adha]] (which means ''The Festival of Sacrifice'') 70 days after at the end of the Islamic year, a holiday which is held along with the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, ''[[Hajj]]''.<ref name=Holidays>{{cite web | url =http://damascus.usembassy.gov/holidays.html | title =Holidays | accessdate =2007-05-24 | publisher =US Embassy in Damascus | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070528063100/http://damascus.usembassy.gov/holidays.html | archive-date =2007-05-28 | url-status =dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Dating and marriage ===\nMany Syrian Americans prefer traditional relationships and disfavor casual dating. For example, The Muslims can only date after completing their marriage contact, known as ''kitabt al-kitab'' (Arabic: \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628, which means \"writing the book\" in English), a period that ranges from a few months to a year or more to get used to living with one another. After this time period, a wedding takes place and fulfills the marriage. Muslims tend to marry other Muslims only, but can tend to be dynamic in terms of other ethnic groups; Unable to find other suitable Muslim Syrian Americans, many Muslim Syrian American have married other Muslim Americans. However, that is subject to mother disapproval.<ref name=Everyculture/>\n\nSyrian American marriages are usually very strong; this is reflected by the low [[divorce demography|divorce rates]] among Syrian Americans, which are below the average rates in the United States.<ref name=Everyculture/> Generally, Syrian American partners tend to have more children than average American partners; Syrian American partners also tend to have children at early stages of their marriages.

There are also sub-dialects in Syrian Arabic; for example, people from [[Aleppo]] have a distinct and distinguishable accent, one that differs considerably from that of people from [[Homs]] or [[Al-Hasakah]]. Syrians can usually comprehend and understand the dialects of most Arabs, especially those who speak any form of Levantine Arabic.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nMany old Syrian American families have lost their linguistic traditions because many parents do not teach their children Arabic. Newer immigrants, however, maintain their language traditions. The 2000 census shows that 79.9% of Syrian Americans speak English \"very well\".<ref name=\"PAA-US\"/> Throughout the United States, there are [[school]]s which offer Arabic language classes; there are also some [[Eastern Orthodox church]]es which hold Arabic services.\n\n[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] dialects are spoken also, mainly by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], and [[Western Armenian]] by those of Armenian ethnicity.

Some Muslim Syrian women wear a ''[[hijab]]'', which is a [[headscarf]] worn by Muslim and orthodox Christian women to cover their [[hair]].  There are [[Sartorial hijab|various styles]] of ''hijab''.\n\n=== Holidays ===\nSyrian Americans celebrate many religious holidays, with Christian Syrian Americans celebrating most of the [[Liturgical year|Christian holidays]] that are already celebrated in the United States, but in addition to a few others or at different times. For example, They celebrate [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]], but since most Syrians are Eastern Orthodox, they celebrate Easter on a different Sunday from most other Americans, and various Saints' days.\n\nSyrian American Jews celebrate the [[Jewish holiday]]s, such as [[Rosh Hashanah]], [[Yom Kippur]], [[Sukkot]], [[Purim]], [[Passover]] and [[Shavuot]].

After Ramadan is over, Muslims celebrate [[Eid ul-Fitr]], when Muslims break their fasting and revel exuberantly.

For example, The Muslims can only date after completing their marriage contact, known as ''kitabt al-kitab'' (Arabic: \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628, which means \"writing the book\" in English), a period that ranges from a few months to a year or more to get used to living with one another. After this time period, a wedding takes place and fulfills the marriage.

There are also sub-dialects in Syrian Arabic; for example, people from [[Aleppo]] have a distinct and distinguishable accent, one that differs considerably from that of people from [[Homs]] or [[Al-Hasakah]]. Syrians can usually comprehend and understand the dialects of most Arabs, especially those who speak any form of Levantine Arabic.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nMany old Syrian American families have lost their linguistic traditions because many parents do not teach their children Arabic. Newer immigrants, however, maintain their language traditions. The 2000 census shows that 79.9% of Syrian Americans speak English \"very well\".<ref name=\"PAA-US\"/> Throughout the United States, there are [[school]]s which offer Arabic language classes; there are also some [[Eastern Orthodox church]]es which hold Arabic services.\n\n[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] dialects are spoken also, mainly by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], and [[Western Armenian]] by those of Armenian ethnicity.

A Portuguese [[trading post|factory]] and the fort was intact in Kozhikode for short period (1511\u20131525, until the [[Fall of Calicut (1526)|Fall of Calicut]]). The [[English East India Company|English]] landed in 1615 (constructing a trading post in 1665), followed by the [[French East India Company|French]] (1698) and the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] (1752). In 1765, [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] captured Kozhikode as part of its occupation of the Malabar Coast.

He describes Kozhikode as \"one of the great ports of the district of Malabar\" where \"merchants of all parts of the world are found\". The king of this place, he says, \"shaves his chin just as the Haidari Fakeers of Rome do... The greater part of the Muslim merchants of this place are so wealthy that one of them can purchase the whole freightage of such vessels put here and fit out others like them\".<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Ibn Battuta]], H.

He makes note of the 20 or 30 mosques built to cater to the religious needs of the Muslims, the unique system of calculation by the merchants using their fingers and toes (followed to this day) and the matrilineal system of succession.\n\n[[Abdur Razzaq (traveller)|Abdur Razzak]] (1442\u201343) the ambassador of Persian Emperor Sha-Rohk finds the city harbour perfectly secured and notices precious articles from several maritime countries especially from [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], Zirbad and [[Zanzibar]].\n\nThe Italian [[Niccol\u00f2 de' Conti]] (1445), perhaps the first Christian traveller who noticed Kozhikode, describes the city as abounding in pepper, lac, ginger, a larger kind of cinnamon, myrobalans and zedary. He calls it a noble emporium for all India, with a [[circumference]] of eight miles (13&nbsp; km).\n\nThe Russian traveller Athanasius Nikitin or [[Afanasy Nikitin]] (1468\u201374) calls 'Calecut' a port for the whole Indian sea and describes it as having a \"big bazaar.\"\n\nOther travellers who visited Kozhikode include the Italian [[Ludovico di Varthema]]<ref>Varthema, Ludovico di, ''The Travels of Ludovico di Varthema, A.D.1503\u201308'', translated from the original 1510 Italian ed. by John Winter Jones, Hakluyt Society, London</ref> (1503\u20131508) and [[Duarte Barbosa]].<ref>Gangadharan.

The Governor of Ernad built a fort at a place called Velapuram to safeguard his new interests. The fort most likely lent its name to ''Koyil Kotta'' the precursor to Kozhikode. Thus the city came into existence sometime in the 13th century CE. The status of Udaiyavar increased and he became known as Swami Nambiyathiri Thirumulpad, and eventually Samuri or Samoothiri. Europeans called him in a corrupt form as [[Zamorin of Calicut|Zamorin]].\n\nAccording to K.V. Krishna Iyer, the rise of Kozhikode is at once a cause and a consequence of Samoothiri's ascendancy in Kerala. By the end of the century, Samoothiri was at the zenith of his powers with all princes and chieftains of Kerala north of Kochi acknowledging his suzerainty.<ref name=\"Kunjali Maraikar\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kozhikode.com/history.htm|title=Kozhikode (Calicut), Kerala, India - Kozhikode (Calicut) Hotels, Kozhikode (Calicut) resorts, Kozhikode (Calicut) tourism, Kozhikode (Calicut) real estate and Kozhikode (Calicut) businesses|website=Kozhikode.com|accessdate=22 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nKozhikode features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Am''). A brief spell of pre-monsoon [[Mango showers]] hits the city sometime during April. However, the primary source of rain is the [[South-west monsoon]] that sets in the first week of June and continues until September.

A Portuguese [[trading post|factory]] and the fort was intact in Kozhikode for short period (1511\u20131525, until the [[Fall of Calicut (1526)|Fall of Calicut]]). The [[English East India Company|English]] landed in 1615 (constructing a trading post in 1665), followed by the [[French East India Company|French]] (1698) and the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] (1752).

The Governor of Ernad built a fort at a place called Velapuram to safeguard his new interests. The fort most likely lent its name to ''Koyil Kotta'' the precursor to Kozhikode. Thus the city came into existence sometime in the 13th century CE. The status of Udaiyavar increased and he became known as Swami Nambiyathiri Thirumulpad, and eventually Samuri or Samoothiri. Europeans called him in a corrupt form as [[Zamorin of Calicut|Zamorin]].\n\nAccording to K.V. Krishna Iyer, the rise of Kozhikode is at once a cause and a consequence of Samoothiri's ascendancy in Kerala.
