{"title_page": "Unit interval", "text_new": "{{For|the data transmission signaling interval|Unit interval (data transmission)}}\n\n[[File:Unit-interval.svg|thumb|The unit interval as a [[subset]] of the [[real line]]]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''unit interval''' is the [[interval (mathematics)|closed interval]] {{closed-closed|0,1}}, that is, the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all [[real number]]s that are greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1.  It is often denoted ''{{math|I}}'' (capital letter <big><tt>I</tt></big>). In addition to its role in [[real analysis]], the unit interval is used to study [[homotopy theory]] in the field of [[topology]].\n\nIn the literature, the term \"unit interval\" is sometimes applied to the other shapes that an interval from 0 to 1 could take: {{open-closed|0,1}}, {{closed-open|0,1}}, and {{open-open|0,1}}.  However, the notation ''{{math|I}}'' is most commonly reserved for the closed interval {{closed-closed|0,1}}.\n\n== Properties ==\n\nThe unit interval is a [[complete metric space]], [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[extended real number line]]. As a [[topological space]], it is [[compact space|compact]], [[contractible]], [[connectedness|path connected]] and [[Locally connected space|locally path connected]]. The [[Hilbert cube]] is obtained by taking a topological product of countably many copies of the unit interval. \n\nIn [[mathematical analysis]], the unit interval is a [[dimension|one-dimensional]] analytical [[manifold]] whose boundary consists of the two points 0 and 1. Its standard [[orientability|orientation]] goes from 0 to 1. \n\nThe unit interval is a [[total order|totally ordered set]] and a [[complete lattice]] (every subset of the unit interval has a [[supremum]] and an [[infimum]]).\n\n===Cardinality===\n{{Main|Cardinality of the continuum}}\n\nThe ''size'' or ''[[cardinality]]'' of a set is the number of elements it contains.\n\nThe unit interval is a [[subset]] of the [[real number]]s <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>.

It is often denoted ''{{math|I}}'' (capital letter <big><tt>I</tt></big>). In addition to its role in [[real analysis]], the unit interval is used to study [[homotopy theory]] in the field of [[topology]].\n\nIn the literature, the term \"unit interval\" is sometimes applied to the other shapes that an interval from 0 to 1 could take: {{open-closed|0,1}}, {{closed-open|0,1}}, and {{open-open|0,1}}.  However, the notation ''{{math|I}}'' is most commonly reserved for the closed interval {{closed-closed|0,1}}.\n\n== Properties ==\n\nThe unit interval is a [[complete metric space]], [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[extended real number line]]. As a [[topological space]], it is [[compact space|compact]], [[contractible]], [[connectedness|path connected]] and [[Locally connected space|locally path connected]]. The [[Hilbert cube]] is obtained by taking a topological product of countably many copies of the unit interval. \n\nIn [[mathematical analysis]], the unit interval is a [[dimension|one-dimensional]] analytical [[manifold]] whose boundary consists of the two points 0 and 1. Its standard [[orientability|orientation]] goes from 0 to 1. \n\nThe unit interval is a [[total order|totally ordered set]] and a [[complete lattice]] (every subset of the unit interval has a [[supremum]] and an [[infimum]]).\n\n===Cardinality===\n{{Main|Cardinality of the continuum}}\n\nThe ''size'' or ''[[cardinality]]'' of a set is the number of elements it contains.\n\nThe unit interval is a [[subset]] of the [[real number]]s <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>.

As part of the [[British Invasion]], his [[hit record|hit]] song \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached number 8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1965.\n\nHe wrote several books on [[popular music]], beginning with ''After the Ball'', published by [[Penguin Books]] (Britain) and [[Simon & Schuster]] (United States) in 1972. He accompanied his singing by playing the [[ukulele]] and, through his [[gramophone record|records]], concerts, and film work, helped to stimulate the revival of interest in the instrument. His re-creation of the music played aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}} in [[Titanic (1997 film)|the film of that name]] won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1998 for package design and a nomination for Whitcomb's liner notes (''Titanic: Music as Heard on the Fateful Voyage'').\n\n==Early life==\nWhitcomb was born in [[Woking]], Surrey, England.  His father, Pat, worked for his father's film company British Screen Classics in the 1920s, eventually co-starring in ''Mr. Nobody'' (released by Fox in 1929). His father was a trained pianist and encouraged Whitcomb to also play piano. Ian's younger brother Robin accompanied him on drums in their first bands, notably The Ragtime Suwanee Six (1960\u201362) whose manager was [[Denny Cordell]], later to produce records by [[Procol Harum]] and [[Joe Cocker]]. Robin went on to play [[tambourine]] on [[Sonny & Cher]]'s hit \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" (1965).\n\nGrowing up, Whitcomb's chief musical inspirations were [[Phil Harris]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Guy Mitchell]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]]. He was sent away to boarding school in 1949 (Newlands, Seaford, [[Sussex]]) at age 8 and there he soon formed a [[tissue paper-and-comb]] band to entertain staff and boys with current hits such as \"[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|Riders in the Sky]]\".\n\n==Music and writing career==\nAt [[Bryanston School|Bryanston]], a [[independent school (UK)|public school]] in Dorset, England, Whitcomb started a [[skiffle]] group in 1957 and then a [[rock and roll]] band in 1959. In the early 1960s, while studying history at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], he became a founding member of Dublin's first{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[rhythm and blues]] band, Bluesville. Their second record release, \"This Sporting Life\" (written by [[Brownie McGhee]]), charted in the United States in 1965. Whitcomb's next single, \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached Billboard's number 8 spot in July 1965.<ref name=Dixon>{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=Daniel|title=Ukulele: The World's Friendliest Instrument|year=2011|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=978-1-4236-0369-6|pages=90\u201391}}</ref> During his summer vacation in 1965, Whitcomb went to America to appear on such television programs as ''[[Shindig!|Shindig]]'', ''[[Hollywood A Go-Go]]'' and ''[[American Bandstand]]''. Whitcomb played the [[Hollywood Bowl]] with [[The Beach Boys]] in 1965 and then toured with [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Kinks]], and [[Sam the Sham]] and the Pharaohs.\n\n\"N-Nervous!\", Whitcomb's next release, was recorded in Hollywood and reached No. 59 in Billboard and No. 47 in Cash Box. He returned to Dublin for his history finals and received a BA [[academic degree|degree]]. In 1966 he turned to early popular song: his version of a 1916 [[Al Jolson]] comedy number, \"Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go with Friday on Saturday Night?\" was a West Coast hit, reviving the ukulele before the emergence of [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]].<ref name=Tranquada>{{cite book|last=Tranquada|first=Jim|title=The Ukulele \u2013 A History|year=2012|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-3634-4|pages=154\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAfter making four albums for the Tower label and producing [[Mae West]] on her album called ''[[Great Balls Of Fire (Mae West album)|Great Balls of Fire]]'' for [[MGM Records]], Whitcomb returned to the UK where he began his writing career with ''After the Ball'', published  in 1972. He later wrote ''Tin Pan Alley, A Pictorial History'' (1919\u20131939) and a novel, ''Lotusland: A Story of Southern California''.\n\nReturning to Hollywood, Whitcomb starred in and wrote ''L.A.\u2013My Home Town'' (BBC TV; 1976) and ''Tin Pan Alley'' (PBS; 1974). He also provided the music for a documentary film, ''Bugs Bunny: Superstar'' (UA), which was narrated by [[Orson Welles]]. For Play-Rite Music he cut 18 piano rolls that were included in an album, ''Pianomelt''. His other albums reflected his research into the genres of [[ragtime]], [[Tin Pan Alley]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]]. These, beginning with ''Under the Ragtime Moon''  (1972), were released on several [[record label]]s including [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[United Artists]], and [[Decca Records]]. During that time he also wrote and produced singles for Warner Bros.' country division, most notably \"Hands\", a [[massage parlour]] story, and \"A Friend of a Friend of Mine\".\n\nIn the 1980s Whitcomb published ''Rock Odyssey: A Chronicle of the Sixties: Ian Whitcomb'', a memoir of the 1960s and described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as the best personal account of this period. He also published ''Ragtime America'' (Limelight Editions, 1988), followed by a memoir of life as a British expatriate living in Los Angeles, ''Resident Alien'' (Century, 1990). He produced a British documentary on black music, ''Legends of Rhythm and Blues'' (part of the series ''Repercussions'', made by Third Eye Productions for [[Channel Four]] in 1984). During this time he also hosted a [[radio show]] in Los Angeles for fifteen years, taking the program from [[KROQ-FM]] to [[KCRW]] and finally to [[KPCC-FM]].<ref>[http://www.laradio.com/wherew.htm Profile], laradio.com; accessed 7 July 2015.</ref> His songs can he heard in the films ''Bloody Movie'' (1987), ''[[Cold Sassy Tree]]'' (1989), ''[[Encino Man]]'' (1992), ''[[Grass (1999 film)|Grass]]'' (1999), '' [[Man of the Century]]'' (1999), ''Stanley's Gig'' (2000), ''After the Storm'' (2001), ''[[The Cat's Meow]]'' (2002), ''[[Last Call (2002 film)|Last Call]]'' (2002), ''Sleep Easy, Hutch Rimes'' (2002), ''[[Lonesome Jim]]'' (2005), and ''[[Fido (film)|Fido]]'' (2006).   Ian appeared as Grand Marshal in the 24th Occasional Pasadena Doo Dah Parade on November 19, 1999.[https://pasadenadoodahparade.info/archives/]\n\n==Later life==\nWhitcomb performed at music festivals throughout America, often with his [[ragtime]] band, The Bungalow Boys. He continued to write, and he made frequent guest appearances.<ref name=syncopated/> He was a regular performer at Cantalini's Restaurant in Playa del Rey, California.<ref>[http://salernobeach.com/music/ Cantalini's Salerno Beach Restaurant]</ref> \n\nFrom 7 November 2007, Whitcomb had an [[internet radio]] program on Wednesday evenings from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. until 10:00&nbsp;p.m.(PST) at Luxuria Music.<ref>[http://LuxuriaMusic.com LuxuriaMusic.com]</ref> He signed with [[Premiere Radio Networks]] in September 2010 to launch ''The Ian Whitcomb Show'' on XM satellite radio, Channel 24.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nHe was named as a BEST OF L.A. in 2008 by ''[[Los Angeles (magazine)|Los Angeles]]'' magazine.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2009 Whitcomb wrote and, with his Bungalow Boys, performed original music for the West Coast Premiere of ''The Jazz Age'', a play by Allan Knee, at the Blank Theater Company's 2nd Stage Theater in Los Angeles.

19 April 2020) was an English entertainer, singer-songwriter, record producer, writer and actor. As part of the [[British Invasion]], his [[hit record|hit]] song \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached number 8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1965.\n\nHe wrote several books on [[popular music]], beginning with ''After the Ball'', published by [[Penguin Books]] (Britain) and [[Simon & Schuster]] (United States) in 1972. He accompanied his singing by playing the [[ukulele]] and, through his [[gramophone record|records]], concerts, and film work, helped to stimulate the revival of interest in the instrument. His re-creation of the music played aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}} in [[Titanic (1997 film)|the film of that name]] won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1998 for package design and a nomination for Whitcomb's liner notes (''Titanic: Music as Heard on the Fateful Voyage'').\n\n==Early life==\nWhitcomb was born in [[Woking]], Surrey, England.  His father, Pat, worked for his father's film company British Screen Classics in the 1920s, eventually co-starring in ''Mr. Nobody'' (released by Fox in 1929). His father was a trained pianist and encouraged Whitcomb to also play piano. Ian's younger brother Robin accompanied him on drums in their first bands, notably The Ragtime Suwanee Six (1960\u201362) whose manager was [[Denny Cordell]], later to produce records by [[Procol Harum]] and [[Joe Cocker]]. Robin went on to play [[tambourine]] on [[Sonny & Cher]]'s hit \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" (1965).\n\nGrowing up, Whitcomb's chief musical inspirations were [[Phil Harris]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Guy Mitchell]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]]. He was sent away to boarding school in 1949 (Newlands, Seaford, [[Sussex]]) at age 8 and there he soon formed a [[tissue paper-and-comb]] band to entertain staff and boys with current hits such as \"[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|Riders in the Sky]]\".\n\n==Main career==\nAt [[Bryanston School|Bryanston]], a [[independent school (UK)|public school]] in Dorset, England, Whitcomb started a [[skiffle]] group in 1957 and then a [[rock and roll]] band in 1959. In the early 1960s, while studying history at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], he became a founding member of Dublin's first{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[rhythm and blues]] band, Bluesville. Their second record release, \"This Sporting Life\" (written by [[Brownie McGhee]]), charted in the United States in 1965. Whitcomb's next single, \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached Billboard's number 8 spot in July 1965.<ref name=Dixon>{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=Daniel|title=Ukulele: The World's Friendliest Instrument|year=2011|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=978-1-4236-0369-6|pages=90\u201391}}</ref> During his summer vacation in 1965, Whitcomb went to America to appear on such television programs as ''[[Shindig!|Shindig]]'', ''[[Hollywood A Go-Go]]'' and ''[[American Bandstand]]''. Whitcomb played the [[Hollywood Bowl]] with [[The Beach Boys]] in 1965 and then toured with [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Kinks]], and [[Sam the Sham]] and the Pharaohs.\n\n\"N-Nervous!\", Whitcomb's next release, was recorded in Hollywood and reached No. 59 in Billboard and No. 47 in Cash Box. He returned to Dublin for his history finals and received a BA [[academic degree|degree]]. In 1966 he turned to early popular song: his version of a 1916 [[Al Jolson]] comedy number, \"Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go with Friday on Saturday Night?\" was a West Coast hit, reviving the ukulele before the emergence of [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]].<ref name=Tranquada>{{cite book|last=Tranquada|first=Jim|title=The Ukulele \u2013 A History|year=2012|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-3634-4|pages=154\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAfter making four albums for the Tower label and producing [[Mae West]] on her album called ''[[Great Balls Of Fire (Mae West album)|Great Balls of Fire]]'' for [[MGM Records]] in 1972, Whitcomb returned to the UK where he began his writing career with ''After the Ball''. He later wrote ''Tin Pan Alley, A Pictorial History'' (1919\u20131939) and a novel, ''Lotusland: A Story of Southern California''.\n\nReturning to Hollywood, Whitcomb starred in and wrote ''L.A.\u2013My Home Town'' (BBC TV; 1976) and ''Tin Pan Alley'' (PBS; 1974). He also provided the music for a documentary film, ''Bugs Bunny: Superstar'' (UA), which was narrated by [[Orson Welles]]. For Play-Rite Music he cut 18 piano rolls that were included in an album, ''Pianomelt''. His other albums reflected his research into the genres of [[ragtime]], [[Tin Pan Alley]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]]. These, beginning with ''Under the Ragtime Moon''  (1972), were released on several [[record label]]s including [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[United Artists]], and [[Decca Records]]. During that time he also wrote and produced singles for Warner Bros.' country division, most notably \"Hands\", a [[massage parlour]] story, and \"A Friend of a Friend of Mine\".\n\nIn the 1980s Whitcomb published ''Rock Odyssey: A Chronicle of the Sixties: Ian Whitcomb'', a memoir of the 1960s and described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as the best personal account of this period. He also published ''Ragtime America'' (Limelight Editions, 1988), followed by a memoir of life as a British expatriate living in Los Angeles, ''Resident Alien'' (Century, 1990). He produced a British documentary on black music, ''Legends of Rhythm and Blues'' (part of the series ''Repercussions'', made by Third Eye Productions for [[Channel Four]] in 1984). During this time he also hosted a [[radio show]] in Los Angeles for fifteen years, taking the program from [[KROQ-FM]] to [[KCRW]] and finally to [[KPCC-FM]].<ref>[http://www.laradio.com/wherew.htm Profile], laradio.com; accessed 7 July 2015.</ref> His songs can he heard in the films ''Bloody Movie'' (1987), ''[[Cold Sassy Tree]]'' (1989), ''[[Encino Man]]'' (1992), ''[[Grass (1999 film)|Grass]]'' (1999), '' [[Man of the Century]]'' (1999), ''Stanley's Gig'' (2000), ''After the Storm'' (2001), ''[[The Cat's Meow]]'' (2002), ''[[Last Call (2002 film)|Last Call]]'' (2002), ''Sleep Easy, Hutch Rimes'' (2002), ''[[Lonesome Jim]]'' (2005), and ''[[Fido (film)|Fido]]'' (2006).   Ian appeared as Grand Marshal in the 24th Occasional Pasadena Doo Dah Parade on November 19, 1999.[https://pasadenadoodahparade.info/archives/]\n\n==Later life==\nWhitcomb performed at music festivals throughout America, often with his [[ragtime]] band, The Bungalow Boys. He continued to write, and he made frequent guest appearances.<ref name=syncopated/> He was a regular performer at Cantalini's Restaurant in Playa del Rey, California.<ref>[http://salernobeach.com/music/ Cantalini's Salerno Beach Restaurant]</ref> \n\nFrom 7 November 2007, Whitcomb had an [[internet radio]] program on Wednesday evenings from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. until 10:00&nbsp;p.m.(PST) at Luxuria Music.<ref>[http://LuxuriaMusic.com LuxuriaMusic.com]</ref> He signed with [[Premiere Radio Networks]] in September 2010 to launch ''The Ian Whitcomb Show'' on XM satellite radio, Channel 24.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nHe was named as a BEST OF L.A. in 2008 by ''[[Los Angeles (magazine)|Los Angeles]]'' magazine.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2009 Whitcomb wrote and, with his Bungalow Boys, performed original music for the West Coast Premiere of ''The Jazz Age'', a play by Allan Knee, at the Blank Theater Company's 2nd Stage Theater in Los Angeles.
