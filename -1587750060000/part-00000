He currently works as a [[sports agent]].\n\nFor most of his career, Sheffield played [[right fielder|right field]], though he has also played [[Left fielder|left field]], [[third base]], [[shortstop]], and a handful of games at [[first baseman|first base]]. He played for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[Florida Marlins]], [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Atlanta Braves]], [[New York Yankees]], [[Detroit Tigers]], and the [[New York Mets]]. Sheffield was a first-round pick of the Brewers, who selected him sixth overall in the {{baseball year|1986}} amateur draft after a standout prep career at [[Hillsborough High School (Florida)|Hillsborough High School]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. He bats and throws right-handed.\n\nSheffield hit his 500th home run on April 17, 2009.  As of his last game, Sheffield ranked second among all active players in [[base on balls|walks]] (1,475), third in [[run (baseball)|runs]] (1,636), fourth in [[Run batted in|RBIs]] (1,676), fifth in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (2,689) and [[home run]]s (509), and sixth in [[hit by pitch]]es (135).\n\nSheffield's batting swing was an exemplary mix of savage speed and pinpoint control.  Despite his high home run total, Sheffield only topped 80 strikeouts twice in 22 seasons, while finishing his career among the all-time top 20 walks leaders.  Because of his combination of skill, sportswriter [[Joe Posnanski]] wrote, \"I can't imagine there has ever been a scarier hitter to face.\"  His first manager [[Tom Trebelhorn]] said, \"Gary can turn on a 38-caliber bullet.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://joeposnanski.substack.com/p/ballot-12-gary-sheffield|title=Ballot 12: Gary Sheffield|last=Posnanski|first=Joe|website=joeposnanski.substack.com|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\nHe is the nephew of [[Dwight Gooden]].

Sheffield has publicly said that his grandfather had a significant positive impact on his life, influencing him as a person and as an athlete.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nSheffield was a good hitter in the Little Leagues. However, Sheffield had problems with his temper and attitude, which would continue in the Major Leagues. Once, when he was late to practice, his coach benched him and Sheffield picked up a bat and chased the coach all over the field, resulting in him being kicked off the team for a year.<ref name=\"Jock\"/> When Sheffield was eleven, he was selected to the Belmont Heights Little League All-Stars, which included future [[Chicago Cubs]] #1 pick Ty Griffin, future Major Leaguer [[Derek Bell (baseball)|Derek Bell]], and other future [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] players.<ref name=\"Jock\"/> The team made it to the finals of the [[1980 Little League World Series]] but lost to [[Taiwan national baseball team|Taiwan]] 4\u20133.

During his junior year, he bulked up to 175 pounds and was a [[pitcher]] and [[third baseman]].<ref name=\"Jock\"/> During his senior year, his fastball reached the upper 80's and he frequently showed home run power. As a batter, Sheffield hit .500 and 15 [[home run]]s, in only 62 official [[at-bats]].<ref name=\"Jock\"/> At the end of the season he was named the [[Gatorade Player of the Year awards|Gatorade National Player of the Year]].<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n==Professional baseball career==\n[[File:Gary Sheffield - El Paso Diablos - 1988.jpg|thumb|Sheffield in 1988]]\n\n===Minor leagues===\nAfter high school, the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] drafted Sheffield with the sixth pick of the first round of the [[1986 Major League Baseball draft|1986 MLB draft]].<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sheffga01.shtml Baseball-Reference.com Bio]</ref> Sheffield later said that if he had not been drafted in the first round, he probably would have played [[college baseball]] for the [[Miami Hurricanes baseball|Miami Hurricanes]].<ref name=\"streetsmarts\">{{cite news|last1=Gammons|first1=Peter|title=Street Smarts|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/04/05/119664/street-smarts-gary-sheffield-learned-his-baseball-and-more-in-tampas-belmont-heights|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=April 5, 1989}}</ref> After being drafted he was shipped to [[Helena Brewers|Helena]] of the [[Pioneer League (baseball)|Pioneer League]], where he had a .365 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] and 71 RBIs in 57 games. The only question was what [[Baseball positions|position]] he would play. He was slotted at shortstop, but struggled at the position, committing many [[error (baseball)|errors]] and wild throws. In 1987, he was assigned to [[Stockton Ports|Stockton]] of the [[Class A (baseball)|Class-A]] [[California League]], where his defense improved and he produced at the plate. His batting average went below .300, but he led the league in RBIs with 103, and at the end of the year he was voted the Brewers' best prospect. In his third season, he went from Double-A to the majors. In 134 games for the [[El Paso Diablos]] and [[Denver]], he batted .327 with 28 homers and 118 RBIs and was considered ready for the majors.\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\nSheffield was called up from the minors when rosters were expanded in September and made his major league debut on September 3, 1988. As a teenager, he got off to a fast start, with his first career hit being a home run off [[Mark Langston]], though Sheffield finished the season with a .238 batting average and four home runs in 24 games. After a decline in play and several injuries, he found himself competing with [[Bill Spiers]] in a race for starting shortstop. After this, he was moved to third base and criticized the team, saying it was a black and white issue.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DF1330F93BA15756C0A966958260Sheffield Is Older and Better]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> At the end of the 1989 season, he batted .247 with five home runs and 32 RBIs. In 1990, he worked under [[Don Baylor]], who had been hired as their [[hitting coach]]. He finished the season batting .294, with 10 home runs. While his playing improved, there were issues with Sheffield in the clubhouse, and went as far as accusing the organization of being racist after keeping him at third instead of playing him at shortstop where the white Spiers played.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=alipour/070315&sportCat=mlb Espn.com Interview]</ref> In his final season with the Brewers, he injured his wrist, thumb, and shoulder, playing in only 50 games.<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n===San Diego Padres===\nAfter four seasons in Milwaukee, the Brewers traded Sheffield to the [[San Diego Padres]] for [[Ricky Bones]], [[Jos\u00e9 Valentin]], and [[Matt Mieske]] on March 26, 1992. Sheffield faced his uncle [[Dwight Gooden]] for the first time in a Major League game on May 12, 1992, getting a hit in three at-bats. In his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] season, he contended for the [[Triple Crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] for much of the year; while he missed out on the home run (33, two fewer than the leader, teammate [[Fred McGriff]]) and RBIs (100, nine fewer than leader [[Darren Daulton]]) titles, he won the [[National League]] batting title (the only one of the nine in Padre history not won by [[Tony Gwynn]]) with a .330 average.\n\nIn 1993, he started the season by hitting 10 home runs and batting .295 and was traded in midseason to the [[Florida Marlins]].\n\n===Florida Marlins===\nOn June 24, 1993, he was traded, with [[Rich Rodriguez (baseball)|Rich Rodriguez]], to the [[Florida Marlins]] for [[Trevor Hoffman]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez (pitcher)|Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Andr\u00e9s Berumen]]. He finished the season hitting 10 home runs, batting .292 and knocking in 37 runs while with the Marlins, and was the starting third baseman for the NL in the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. At the end of the season, the Marlins gave him a four-year deal that made him the highest-paid player at third base.<ref>[http://www.futilityinfielder.com/blog/2004/08/gary-sheffield-reconsidered-part-i.shtmlGary Sheffield, Reconsidered \u2013 Part I]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> During the 1994 season, the Marlins moved him from third base to right field, where he showed great success with an impressive arm. Sheffield hit 112 home runs with the Marlins from 1994 to 1998, including 42 in 1996, making the All-Star Game in 1996, and leading them to victory in the [[1997 World Series]] against the [[Cleveland Indians]]. He was traded to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in 1998 because the Marlins allegedly could not afford a contract extension and because the Dodgers' parent company at the time, [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], was looking to secure a television contract with the Marlins in exchange for trading popular Dodger [[Mike Piazza]].<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n===Los Angeles Dodgers===\nOn May 14, 1998, he was traded along with [[Manuel Barrios]], [[Charles Johnson (catcher)|Charles Johnson]], [[Bobby Bonilla]], and [[Jim Eisenreich]] to the Los Angeles Dodgers for [[Mike Piazza]] and [[Todd Zeile]]. Sheffield finished the season with the Dodgers batting .316 and hitting 16 homers while driving in 57 runs. In 3\u00bd seasons with the Dodgers, he hit 129 home runs and drove in 367 runs. He made three All-Star games while playing with the Dodgers and had become one of the best outfielders in the game. But during the offseason, he began lobbying for a trade because he thought the Dodgers were spending their money stupidly and sliding in the wrong direction, and publicly criticized coaches and teammates.<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n===Atlanta Braves===\nOn January 15, 2002, Sheffield was traded to the [[Atlanta Braves]] for [[Brian Jordan]], [[Odalis P\u00e9rez]], and [[Andrew Brown (pitcher)|Andrew Brown]]. He spent two seasons with the Braves hitting 64 home runs and knocking in 216 RBIs including 132 in 2003. After two seasons with the Braves, he became a [[free agent]] for the first time in his long career on October 27, 2003.\n\n===New York Yankees===\nOn December 19, 2003, after negotiations between Sheffield and [[George Steinbrenner]], a contract was agreed upon with the [[New York Yankees]] worth $39 million over three years. This deal included $13.5 million in deferred money and a $13 million team option for 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1688518 |title=Sheff prepared for Boss to lean on him |accessdate=August 6, 2009|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 17, 2003 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref> He joined a lineup that included [[Derek Jeter]], [[Jason Giambi]] and the newly acquired [[Alex Rodriguez]]. In his first season with the Yankees, Sheffield started slowly, but finished the season with 36 home runs, 121 RBIs, and a .290 batting average, helping him finish second in the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|MVP]] voting behind [[Vladimir Guerrero]]. On July 27 Sheffield hit his 400th career homerun off of [[Micheal Nakamura]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in the top of the 9th inning. In his second season with the Yankees, he continued to play well, hitting another 34 home runs and driving in 123 runs. Sheffield started the 2006 season on pace for a .300 batting average and 30 homers, before he collided with [[Shea Hillenbrand]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] on April 29, 2006. He tried to play despite the injury, but ultimately needed wrist surgery. Sheffield did not return until late September. He had lost his right field job to [[Bobby Abreu]], whom the Yankees had acquired in a trade deadline transaction. This forced Sheffield to play first base for the first time in his MLB career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sheffga01.shtml|title=Gary Sheffield Stats|website=Baseball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> At the end of the 2006 season, the Yankees picked up Sheffield's 2007 option and traded him to the [[Detroit Tigers]].\n\n===Detroit Tigers===\n[[File:Sheffield BP.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Sheffield (right) with the Tigers in {{baseball year|2007}}.]]\nOn November 10, 2006, he was traded to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for minor league pitchers [[Humberto S\u00e1nchez]], [[Kevin Whelan]], and [[Anthony Claggett]].

Baseball]] [[outfielder]] who played with eight teams from 1988 to 2009. He currently works as a [[sports agent]].\n\nFor most of his career, Sheffield played [[right fielder|right field]], though he has also played [[Left fielder|left field]], [[third base]], [[shortstop]], and a handful of games at [[first baseman|first base]]. He played for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[Florida Marlins]], [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Atlanta Braves]], [[New York Yankees]], [[Detroit Tigers]], and the [[New York Mets]]. Sheffield was a first-round pick of the Brewers, who selected him sixth overall in the {{baseball year|1986}} amateur draft after a standout prep career at [[Hillsborough High School (Florida)|Hillsborough High School]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. He bats and throws right-handed.\n\nSheffield hit his 500th home run on April 17, 2009.  As of his last game, Sheffield ranked second among all active players in [[base on balls|walks]] (1,475), third in [[run (baseball)|runs]] (1,636), fourth in [[Run batted in|RBIs]] (1,676), fifth in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (2,689) and [[home run]]s (509), and sixth in [[hit by pitch]]es (135).\n\nSheffield's batting swing was an exemplary mix of savage speed and pinpoint control.  Despite his high home run total, Sheffield only topped 80 strikeouts twice in 22 seasons, while finishing his career among the all-time top 20 walks leaders.

Sheffield has publicly said that his grandfather had a significant positive impact on his life, influencing him as a person and as an athlete.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nSheffield was a good hitter in the Little Leagues. However, Sheffield had problems with his temper and attitude, which would continue in the Major Leagues. Once, when he was late to practice, his coach benched him and Sheffield picked up a bat and chased the coach all over the field, resulting in him being kicked off the team for a year.<ref name=\"Jock\"/> When Sheffield was eleven, he was selected to the Belmont Heights Little League All-Stars, which included future [[Chicago Cubs]] #1 pick Ty Griffin, future Major Leaguer [[Derek Bell (baseball)|Derek Bell]], and other future [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] players.<ref name=\"Jock\"/> The team made it to the finals of the [[1980 Little League World Series]] but lost to [[Taiwan national baseball team|Taiwan]] 4\u20133.

During his junior year, he bulked up to 175 pounds and was a [[pitcher]] and [[third baseman]].<ref name=\"Jock\"/> During his senior year, his fastball reached the upper 80's and he frequently showed home run power. As a batter, Sheffield hit .500 and 15 [[home run]]s, in only 62 official [[at-bats]].<ref name=\"Jock\"/> At the end of the season he was named the [[Gatorade Player of the Year awards|Gatorade National Player of the Year]].<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n==Professional baseball career==\n[[File:Gary Sheffield - El Paso Diablos - 1988.jpg|thumb|Sheffield in 1988]]\n\n===Minor leagues===\nAfter high school, the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] drafted Sheffield with the sixth pick of the first round of the [[1986 Major League Baseball draft|1986 MLB draft]].<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sheffga01.shtml Baseball-Reference.com Bio]</ref> Sheffield later said that if he had not been drafted in the first round, he probably would have played [[college baseball]] for the [[Miami Hurricanes baseball|Miami Hurricanes]].<ref name=\"streetsmarts\">{{cite news|last1=Gammons|first1=Peter|title=Street Smarts|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/04/05/119664/street-smarts-gary-sheffield-learned-his-baseball-and-more-in-tampas-belmont-heights|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=April 5, 1989}}</ref> After being drafted he was shipped to [[Helena Brewers|Helena]] of the [[Pioneer League (baseball)|Pioneer League]], where he had a .365 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] and 71 RBIs in 57 games. The only question was what [[Baseball positions|position]] he would play. He was slotted at shortstop, but struggled at the position, committing many [[error (baseball)|errors]] and wild throws. In 1987, he was assigned to [[Stockton Ports|Stockton]] of the [[Class A (baseball)|Class-A]] [[California League]], where his defense improved and he produced at the plate. His batting average went below .300, but he led the league in RBIs with 103, and at the end of the year he was voted the Brewers' best prospect. In his third season, he went from Double-A to the majors. In 134 games for the [[El Paso Diablos]] and [[Denver]], he batted .327 with 28 homers and 118 RBIs and was considered ready for the majors.\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\nSheffield was called up from the minors when rosters were expanded in September and made his major league debut on September 3, 1988. As a teenager, he got off to a fast start, with his first career hit being a home run off [[Mark Langston]], though Sheffield finished the season with a .238 batting average and four home runs in 24 games. After a decline in play and several injuries, he found himself competing with [[Bill Spiers]] in a race for starting shortstop. After this, he was moved to third base and criticized the team, saying it was a black and white issue.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DF1330F93BA15756C0A966958260Sheffield Is Older and Better]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> At the end of the 1989 season, he batted .247 with five home runs and 32 RBIs. In 1990, he worked under [[Don Baylor]], who had been hired as their [[hitting coach]]. He finished the season batting .294, with 10 home runs. While his playing improved, there were issues with Sheffield in the clubhouse, and went as far as accusing the organization of being racist after keeping him at third instead of playing him at shortstop where the white Spiers played.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=alipour/070315&sportCat=mlb Espn.com Interview]</ref> In his final season with the Brewers, he injured his wrist, thumb, and shoulder, playing in only 50 games.<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n===San Diego Padres===\nAfter four seasons in Milwaukee, the Brewers traded Sheffield to the [[San Diego Padres]] for [[Ricky Bones]], [[Jos\u00e9 Valentin]], and [[Matt Mieske]] on March 26, 1992. Sheffield faced his uncle [[Dwight Gooden]] for the first time in a Major League game on May 12, 1992, getting a hit in three at-bats. In his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] season, he contended for the [[Triple Crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] for much of the year; while he missed out on the home run (33, two fewer than the leader, teammate [[Fred McGriff]]) and RBIs (100, nine fewer than leader [[Darren Daulton]]) titles, he won the [[National League]] batting title (the only one of the nine in Padre history not won by [[Tony Gwynn]]) with a .330 average.\n\nIn 1993, he started the season by hitting 10 home runs and batting .295 and was traded in midseason to the [[Florida Marlins]].\n\n===Florida Marlins===\nOn June 24, 1993, he was traded, with [[Rich Rodriguez (baseball)|Rich Rodriguez]], to the [[Florida Marlins]] for [[Trevor Hoffman]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez (pitcher)|Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Andr\u00e9s Berumen]]. He finished the season hitting 10 home runs, batting .292 and knocking in 37 runs while with the Marlins, and was the starting third baseman for the NL in the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. At the end of the season, the Marlins gave him a four-year deal that made him the highest-paid player at third base.<ref>[http://www.futilityinfielder.com/blog/2004/08/gary-sheffield-reconsidered-part-i.shtmlGary Sheffield, Reconsidered \u2013 Part I]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> During the 1994 season, the Marlins moved him from third base to right field, where he showed great success with an impressive arm. Sheffield hit 112 home runs with the Marlins from 1994 to 1998, including 42 in 1996, making the All-Star Game in 1996, and leading them to victory in the [[1997 World Series]] against the [[Cleveland Indians]]. He was traded to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in 1998 because the Marlins allegedly could not afford a contract extension and because the Dodgers' parent company at the time, [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], was looking to secure a television contract with the Marlins in exchange for trading popular Dodger [[Mike Piazza]].<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n===Los Angeles Dodgers===\nOn May 14, 1998, he was traded along with [[Manuel Barrios]], [[Charles Johnson (catcher)|Charles Johnson]], [[Bobby Bonilla]], and [[Jim Eisenreich]] to the Los Angeles Dodgers for [[Mike Piazza]] and [[Todd Zeile]]. Sheffield finished the season with the Dodgers batting .316 and hitting 16 homers while driving in 57 runs. In 3\u00bd seasons with the Dodgers, he hit 129 home runs and drove in 367 runs. He made three All-Star games while playing with the Dodgers and had become one of the best outfielders in the game. But during the offseason, he began lobbying for a trade because he thought the Dodgers were spending their money stupidly and sliding in the wrong direction, and publicly criticized coaches and teammates.<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n===Atlanta Braves===\nOn January 15, 2002, Sheffield was traded to the [[Atlanta Braves]] for [[Brian Jordan]], [[Odalis P\u00e9rez]], and [[Andrew Brown (pitcher)|Andrew Brown]]. He spent two seasons with the Braves hitting 64 home runs and knocking in 216 RBIs including 132 in 2003. After two seasons with the Braves, he became a [[free agent]] for the first time in his long career on October 27, 2003.\n\n===New York Yankees===\nOn December 19, 2003, after negotiations between Sheffield and [[George Steinbrenner]], a contract was agreed upon with the [[New York Yankees]] worth $39 million over three years. This deal included $13.5 million in deferred money and a $13 million team option for 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1688518 |title=Sheff prepared for Boss to lean on him |accessdate=August 6, 2009|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 17, 2003 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref> He joined a lineup that included [[Derek Jeter]], [[Jason Giambi]] and the newly acquired [[Alex Rodriguez]]. In his first season with the Yankees, Sheffield started slowly, but finished the season with 36 home runs, 121 RBIs, and a .290 batting average, helping him finish second in the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|MVP]] voting behind [[Vladimir Guerrero]]. On July 27 Sheffield hit his 400th career homerun off of [[Micheal Nakamura]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in the top of the 9th inning. In his second season with the Yankees, he continued to play well, hitting another 34 home runs and driving in 123 runs. Sheffield started the 2006 season on pace for a .300 batting average and 30 homers, before he collided with [[Shea Hillenbrand]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] on April 29, 2006. He tried to play despite the injury, but ultimately needed wrist surgery. Sheffield did not return until late September. He had lost his right field job to [[Bobby Abreu]], whom the Yankees had acquired in a trade deadline transaction. This forced Sheffield to play first base for the first time in his MLB career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sheffga01.shtml|title=Gary Sheffield Stats|website=Baseball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> At the end of the 2006 season, the Yankees picked up Sheffield's 2007 option and traded him to the [[Detroit Tigers]].\n\n===Detroit Tigers===\n[[File:Sheffield BP.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Sheffield (right) with the Tigers in {{baseball year|2007}}.]]\nOn November 10, 2006, he was traded to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for minor league pitchers [[Humberto S\u00e1nchez]], [[Kevin Whelan]], and [[Anthony Claggett]].

On the [[Emscher|Emscher River]] (a [[tributary]] of the [[Rhine]]), it lies at the centre of the [[Ruhr]], the largest urban area of Germany, of which it is the fifth largest city after [[Dortmund]], [[Essen]], [[Duisburg]] and [[Bochum]]. The Ruhr is located in the [[Rhine-Ruhr|Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region]], one of Europe's largest urban areas. Gelsenkirchen is the fifth largest city of [[Westphalia]] after Dortmund, Bochum, [[Bielefeld]] and [[M\u00fcnster]], and it is one of the southernmost cities in the [[Low German]] dialect area. The city is home to the [[Association football|football]] club [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], which is named after {{ill|Gelsenkirchen-Schalke|de}}. The club's current stadium [[Veltins-Arena]], however, is located in {{ill|Gelsenkirchen-Erle|de}}.\n\nGelsenkirchen was first documented in 1150, but it remained a tiny village until the 19th century, when the [[Industrial Revolution]] led to the growth of the entire area.  In 1840, when the mining of [[coal]] began, 6,000 inhabitants lived in Gelsenkirchen; in 1900 the population had increased to 138,000. In the early 20th century, Gelsenkirchen was the most important coal mining town in Europe.  It was called the \"city of a thousand fires\" for the flames of mine gases flaring at night.  In 1928, Gelsenkirchen was merged with the adjoining cities of [[Buer, Germany|Buer]] and {{Interlanguage link|Gelsenkirchen-Horst|de}}. The city bore the name Gelsenkirchen-Buer, until it was renamed Gelsenkirchen in 1930. During the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]] Gelsenkirchen remained a centre of coal production and [[Oil refinery|oil refining]], and for this reason it was bombed in Allied air raids during [[World War II]].  There are no longer colliers in Gelsenkirchen with the city searching for a new image, having been hit for decades with one of the highest unemployment rates in Germany.  Today Germany's largest [[solar power]] plant is located in the city.  In Gelsenkirchen-Scholven there is a coal-fired power station with the tallest chimneys in Germany (302 m).\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Einwohnerentwicklung von Gelsenkirchen.svg|thumb|Population development since 1800]]\n\n===Ancient and medieval times===\nAlthough the part of town now called Buer was first mentioned by [[Heribert of Cologne|Heribert I]] in a document as ''Puira'' in 1003, there were hunting people on a hill north of the [[Emscher]] as early as the [[Bronze Age]] &ndash; and therefore earlier than 1000 BC. They did not live in houses as such, but in small yards gathered together near each other. Later, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] pushed into the area. In about 700, the region was settled by the [[Saxons]]. A few other parts of town which today lie in Gelsenkirchen's north end were mentioned in documents from the early [[Middle Ages]], some examples being: ''Raedese'' (nowadays ''Resse''), Middelvic (''Middelich'', today part of Resse), ''Sutheim'' (''Sutum''; today part of Beckhausen) and ''Sculven'' (nowadays ''Scholven''). Many nearby farming communities were later identified as ''{{Lang|la|iuxta Bure}}'' (\"near Buer\").\n\nIt was about 1150 when the name ''Gelstenkerken'' or ''Geilistirinkirkin'' appeared up for the first time. At about the same time, the first [[Church (building)|church]] in town was built in what is now Buer. This ''{{Lang|la|ecclesia Buron}}'' (\"church at Buer\") was listed in a directory of [[parish]] churches by the sexton from [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]], Theodericus. This settlement belonged to the [[County of Mark|Mark]]. However, in ancient times and even in the Middle Ages, only a few dozen people actually lived in the settlements around the Emscher basin.\n\n===Industrialisation===\nUp until the middle of the 19th century, the area in and around Gelsenkirchen was only thinly settled and almost exclusively agrarian. In 1815, after temporarily belonging to the [[Grand Duchy]] of [[Berg (state)|Berg]], the land now comprising the city of Gelsenkirchen passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], which assigned it to the [[province of Westphalia]]. Whereas the Gelsenkirchen of that time &ndash; not including today's north-end communities, such as Buer &ndash; was put in the ''[[Amt (subnational entity)|Amt]]'' of [[Wattenscheid]] in the [[Bochum]] district, in the governmental [[Arnsberg (region)|region of Arnsberg]], Buer, which was an ''Amt'' in its own right, was along with nearby Horst joined to [[Recklinghausen (district)|Recklinghausen district]] in the governmental [[M\u00fcnster (region)|region of M\u00fcnster]]. This arrangement came to an end only in 1928.\n\nAfter the discovery of [[coal]] &ndash; lovingly known as \"Black Gold\" &ndash; in the [[Ruhr]] area in 1840, and the subsequent [[industrialisation]], the [[Cologne]]\u2013[[Minden]] Railway and the Gelsenkirchen Main Railway Station were opened. In 1868, Gelsenkirchen became the seat of an ''Amt'' within the Bochum district which encompassed the communities of Gelsenkirchen, Braubauerschaft (since 1900, {{Interlanguage link|Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck|de}}), Schalke, He\u00dfler, Bulmke and H\u00fcllen.\n\n[[Friedrich Grillo]] founded the Corporation for Chemical Industry (''Aktiengesellschaft f\u00fcr Chemische Industrie'') in Schalke in 1872, as well as founding the ''Vogelsang & Co.'' with the Grevel family (later ''[[Schalker Eisenh\u00fctte Maschinenfabrik]]''), and also the Schalke Mining and Ironworks Association (''Schalker Gruben- und H\u00fcttenverein''). A year later, and once again in Schalke, he founded the Glass and Mirror Factory Incorporated (''Glas- und Spiegel-Manufaktur AG'').\n\nAfter Gelsenkirchen had become an important heavy-industry hub, it was raised to city in 1875.\n\n===Independent city===\n[[File:Gelsenkirchen nordstern.jpg|thumb|left|Former Zeche Nordstern]]\n[[File:Gelsenkirchen altstadt.jpg|thumb|left|Contrasts in the inner-city]]\nIn 1885, after Bochum district was split up, Gelsenkirchen became the seat of its own district (''Kreis''), which would last until 1926. The cities of Gelsenkirchen and Wattenscheid, as well as the [[Amt (administrative division)|\u00c4mter]] of Braubauerschaft (in 1900, Bismarck), Schalke, \u00dcckendorf, [[Wanne-Eickel|Wanne]] and [[Wattenscheid]] all belonged to the Gelsenkirchen district. A few years later, in 1896, Gelsenkirchen split off from Gelsenkirchen district to become an [[independent city]] ({{lang-de|kreisfreie Stadt}}). In 1891, Horst was split off from the ''Amt'' of Buer, which itself was raised to city status in 1911, and to an independent city status the next year. Meanwhile, Horst became the seat of its own ''Amt''. In 1924, the rural community of [[Flugwerk Deutschland GmbH|Rotthausen]], which until then had belonged to the [[Essen]] district, was made part of the Gelsenkirchen district.\n\nIn 1928, under the Prussian local government reforms, the cities of Gelsenkirchen and Buer along with the ''Amt'' of Horst together became a new ''kreisfreie Stadt'' called Gelsenkirchen-Buer, effective on 1 April that year. From that time, the whole city area belonged to the governmental district of M\u00fcnster. In 1930, on the city's advice, the city's name was changed to ''Gelsenkirchen'', effective 21 May. By this time, the city was home to about 340,000 people.\n\nIn 1931, the Gelsenkirchen Mining Corporation ({{lang-de|Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks-Aktien-Gesellschaft}}) founded the Gelsenberg Petrol Corporation ({{lang-de|Gelsenberg-Benzin-AG}}). In 1935, the Hibernia Mining Company founded the ''Hydrierwerk Scholven AG GE-Buer'' [[Coal liquefaction]] plant. Scholven/Buer began operation in 1936 and achieved a capacity of \"''200,000 tons/year of finished product, mainly aviation base gasoline.''\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071108041008/http://www.fischer-tropsch.org/Bureau_of_Mines/info_circ/ic_7375/ic_7375.htm] After 1937, Gelsenberg-Benzin-AG opened the Nordstern plant for converting bituminous coal to synthetic oil.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Becker |first=Peter W. |year=1981 |title=The Role of Synthetic Fuel In World War II Germany: implications for today? |url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1981/jul-aug/becker.htm |journal=Air University Review |location=[[Maxwell Air Force Base]] |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222003452/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1981/jul-aug/becker.htm |archive-date=22 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Nazi Germany===\nThe [[November 9 in German history|9 November 1938]] [[Kristallnacht]] antisemitic riots destroyed Jewish businesses, dwellings and cemeteries, and a [[synagogue]] in Buer and one in downtown Gelsenkirchen.

Three quarters of Gelsenkirchen was destroyed<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/gelsenkirchen/a-1533348 \"World Cup 2006 \u2013 Gelsenkirchen\"], [[Deutsche Welle]], 19 October 2005</ref> and many above-ground [[air-raid shelter]]s such as near the town hall in Buer are in nearly original form.\n\n[[Oberst]] [[Werner M\u00f6lders]] the legendary [[Luftwaffe]] Fighter pilot was born here.\n\nThe [[Gelsenberg Lager]] subcamp of [[KZ Buchenwald]] was established in 1944<ref>Edward Victor.

In 1994, the Institute for City History opened the documentation centre \"Gelsenkirchen under National Socialism\" ({{Lang|de|Dokumentationsst\u00e4tte \"Gelsenkirchen im Nationalsozialismus\"}}).\n\n===After the war===\nOn 17 December 1953, the ''Kokerei Hassel'' went into operation, billed as Germany's \"first new [[coking plant]]\" since the war. When [[postal code]]s (''Postleitzahlen'') were introduced in 1961, Gelsenkirchen was one of the few cities in [[West Germany]] to be given two codes: Buer was given 466, while Gelsenkirchen got 465. These were in use until 1 July 1993. The \"first [[comprehensive school]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]\" was opened in 1969. Scholven-Chemie AG (the old hydrogenation plant) merged with Gelsenberg-Benzin-AG to form the new corporation VEBA-Oel AG. In 1987, [[Pope John Paul II]] celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] before 85,000 people at Gelsenkirchen's Parkstadion. The Pope also became an honorary member of [[FC Schalke 04]].\n\nIn 1997, the Federal Garden Show (''Bundesgartenschau'' or ''BUGA'') was held on the grounds of the disused {{Interlanguage link|Zeche Nordstern|de|lt=Nordstern}} [[coalmine]] in Horst. In 1999, the last phase of the [[Internationale Bauausstellung Emscher Park]], an undertaking that brought together many cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, was held. [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] was produced at the old Hassel coking works for the last time on 29 September 1999. This marked the shutdown of the last coking plant in Gelsenkirchen, after being a coking town for more than 117 years. In the same year, Shell Solar Deutschland AG took over production of [[photovoltaic]] equipment. On 28 April 2000, the Ewald-Hugo colliery closed &ndash; Gelsenkirchen's last colliery. Three thousand coalminers lost their jobs. In 2003, Buer celebrated its thousandth anniversary of first documentary mention, and FC Schalke 04 celebrated on 4 May 2004 its hundredth anniversary.\n\nToday, Gelsenkirchen is a centre for sciences, services, and production, with good infrastructure.\n\n{{wide image|Gelsenkirchen Altstadt Panorama.jpg|2000px|Panorama of Gelsenkirchen}}\n{{clear|left}}\n===Jewish history===\n\n====19th century====\nThe [[Jewish]] community of Gelsenkirchen was officially established in 1874, relatively late compared to the Jewish [[Ashkenazi]] communities in Germany.

At the turn of the 20th century the [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] community was the most dominant among all Jewish communities in town, and after an [[Organ (music)|organ]] was installed inside the synagogue, and most prayers performed mostly in German instead of traditional Hebrew, the town [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] community decided to stop its attendance of the synagogue and tried to establish a new orthodox community, led by Dr. Max Meyer, Dr. Rubens and Abraham Fr\u00f6hlich, most of them living on Florastra\u00dfe.<ref name=\"talmud.de\" /> In addition, another Jewish orthodox congregation of Polish Jews was found in town.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: A\u2013J'' by Shmuel Spector and Geoffrey Wigoder, NYU Press 2001, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=MFn3KeENnA0C&pg=PA422#v=onepage&q=Gelsenkirchen&f=false p. 422], {{ISBN|9780814793565}}</ref> In 1908, a lot on Wanner Stra\u00dfe was purchased and served the community as its cemetery until 1936, today containing about 400 graves.<ref name=\"talmud.de\" /> In addition, another cemetery was built in 1927 in the suburb of {{Interlanguage link|\u00dcckendorf|de}}.\n\n====Nazi Germany====\nWith the rise of [[Hitler]] and [[National Socialism]] in 1933, Jewish life in Gelsenkirchen was still relatively quiet. In August 1938, 160 Jewish businesses were still open in town. In October 1938, though, an official ban restricted these businesses and all Jewish doctors became unemployed. In the same month, the Jewish community of town was expelled. Between 1937 and 1939, the Jewish population of Gelsenkirchen dropped from 1,600 to 1,000. During [[Kristallnacht]], the town synagogue was destroyed, after two thirds of the town's Jewish population had already left. On 27 January 1942, 350 among the 500 remaining Jews in town were deported to the [[Riga Ghetto]]; later, the last remaining Jews were deported to Warsaw and [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]].\n\n====The Gelsenkirchen transport====\nOn 31 March 1942, a Nazi deportation train set out from Gelsenkirchen and, carrying 48 Jews from the town area, made its way to the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. The train was the first to deport Jews to Warsaw and not to [[Trawniki concentration camp]] in southern Poland, as used before. After it left Gelsenkirchen, the train was boarded by other Jews from [[M\u00fcnster]], [[Dortmund]] and a few other stops along the way, and mostly by the Jews of [[Hanover]], 500 in number. The arrival of this transport from Westphalia and Upper Saxony was recorded in his diaries by Adam Czerniakov, the last chairman of the Warsaw Ghetto [[Judenrat]]. He stated that those older than 68 were allowed to stay in Germany. The majority of these deportees were killed later on the different death sites around modern day Poland.<ref>[http://www.blankgenealogy.com/holocaust/Transports/Germany/March%2031%201942%20Deportation%20Transport%20from%20Gelsenkirchen%20to%20Warsaw%20Ghetto.pdf March 31, 1942, Deportation from Gelsenkirchen to Warsaw Ghetto]  (English), citing A.

In 2005, about 450 Jews were living in town. During the last decade of the 20th century, a noted number of Jews came to the town, after emigrating out of the former USSR. This situation made it necessary to extend the synagogue. Eventually, a new and bigger synagogue was built to serve the increasing Jewish community of Gelsenkirchen. The current community practices Orthodox Judaism, even though no family practices it at home.<ref name=\"talmud.de\" /> On 16 May 2014, antisemitic graffiti were painted on the town synagogue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://antisemitism.org.il/article/87383/swastika-synagogue-old-city|title=CFCA \u2013 Swastika on synagogue in an old city|work=antisemitism.org.il}}</ref>\n\n====Sites====\nThe building at Husemannstra\u00dfe 75 belonged to Dr. Max Meyer, who built it between 1920 and 1921.

[[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and its 262,528 (2016) inhabitants make it the [[List of cities in Germany by population|25th largest city]] of Germany. On the [[Emscher|Emscher River]] (a [[tributary]] of the [[Rhine]]), it lies at the centre of the [[Ruhr]], the largest urban area of Germany, of which it is the fifth largest city after [[Dortmund]], [[Essen]], [[Duisburg]] and [[Bochum]]. The Ruhr is located in the [[Rhine-Ruhr|Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region]], one of Europe's largest urban areas. Gelsenkirchen is the fifth largest city of [[Westphalia]] after Dortmund, Bochum, [[Bielefeld]] and [[M\u00fcnster]], and it is one of the southernmost cities in the [[Low German]] dialect area. The city is home to the [[Association football|football]] club [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], which is named after {{ill|Gelsenkirchen-Schalke|de}}. The club's current stadium [[Veltins-Arena]], however, is located in {{ill|Gelsenkirchen-Erle|de}}.\n\nGelsenkirchen was first documented in 1150, but it remained a tiny village until the 19th century, when the [[Industrial Revolution]] led to the growth of the entire area.  In 1840, when the mining of [[coal]] began, 6,000 inhabitants lived in Gelsenkirchen; in 1900 the population had increased to 138,000. In the early 20th century, Gelsenkirchen was the most important coal mining town in Europe.  It was called the \"city of a thousand fires\" for the flames of mine gases flaring at night.  In 1928, Gelsenkirchen was merged with the adjoining cities of [[Buer, Germany|Buer]] and {{Interlanguage link|Gelsenkirchen-Horst|de}}. The city bore the name Gelsenkirchen-Buer, until it was renamed Gelsenkirchen in 1930. During the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]] Gelsenkirchen remained a centre of coal production and [[Oil refinery|oil refining]], and for this reason it was bombed in Allied air raids during [[World War II]].  There are no longer colliers in Gelsenkirchen with the city searching for a new image, having been hit for decades with one of the highest unemployment rates in Germany.  Today Germany's largest [[solar power]] plant is located in the city.  In Gelsenkirchen-Scholven there is a coal-fired power station with the tallest chimneys in Germany (302 m).\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Einwohnerentwicklung von Gelsenkirchen.svg|thumb|Population development since 1800]]\n\n===Ancient and medieval times===\nAlthough the part of town now called Buer was first mentioned by [[Heribert of Cologne|Heribert I]] in a document as ''Puira'' in 1003, there were hunting people on a hill north of the [[Emscher]] as early as the [[Bronze Age]] &ndash; and therefore earlier than 1000 BC. They did not live in houses as such, but in small yards gathered together near each other. Later, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] pushed into the area. In about 700, the region was settled by the [[Saxons]]. A few other parts of town which today lie in Gelsenkirchen's north end were mentioned in documents from the early [[Middle Ages]], some examples being: ''Raedese'' (nowadays ''Resse''), Middelvic (''Middelich'', today part of Resse), ''Sutheim'' (''Sutum''; today part of Beckhausen) and ''Sculven'' (nowadays ''Scholven''). Many nearby farming communities were later identified as ''{{Lang|la|iuxta Bure}}'' (\"near Buer\").\n\nIt was about 1150 when the name ''Gelstenkerken'' or ''Geilistirinkirkin'' appeared up for the first time. At about the same time, the first [[Church (building)|church]] in town was built in what is now Buer. This ''{{Lang|la|ecclesia Buron}}'' (\"church at Buer\") was listed in a directory of [[parish]] churches by the sexton from [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]], Theodericus. This settlement belonged to the [[County of Mark|Mark]]. However, in ancient times and even in the Middle Ages, only a few dozen people actually lived in the settlements around the Emscher basin.\n\n===Industrialisation===\nUp until the middle of the 19th century, the area in and around Gelsenkirchen was only thinly settled and almost exclusively agrarian. In 1815, after temporarily belonging to the [[Grand Duchy]] of [[Berg (state)|Berg]], the land now comprising the city of Gelsenkirchen passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], which assigned it to the [[province of Westphalia]]. Whereas the Gelsenkirchen of that time &ndash; not including today's north-end communities, such as Buer &ndash; was put in the ''[[Amt (subnational entity)|Amt]]'' of [[Wattenscheid]] in the [[Bochum]] district, in the governmental [[Arnsberg (region)|region of Arnsberg]], Buer, which was an ''Amt'' in its own right, was along with nearby Horst joined to [[Recklinghausen (district)|Recklinghausen district]] in the governmental [[M\u00fcnster (region)|region of M\u00fcnster]]. This arrangement came to an end only in 1928.\n\nAfter the discovery of [[coal]] &ndash; lovingly known as \"Black Gold\" &ndash; in the [[Ruhr]] area in 1840, and the subsequent [[industrialisation]], the [[Cologne]]\u2013[[Minden]] Railway and the Gelsenkirchen Main Railway Station were opened. In 1868, Gelsenkirchen became the seat of an ''Amt'' within the Bochum district which encompassed the communities of Gelsenkirchen, Braubauerschaft (since 1900, {{Interlanguage link|Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck|de}}), Schalke, He\u00dfler, Bulmke and H\u00fcllen.\n\n[[Friedrich Grillo]] founded the Corporation for Chemical Industry (''Aktiengesellschaft f\u00fcr Chemische Industrie'') in Schalke in 1872, as well as founding the ''Vogelsang & Co.'' with the Grevel family (later ''[[Schalker Eisenh\u00fctte Maschinenfabrik]]''), and also the Schalke Mining and Ironworks Association (''Schalker Gruben- und H\u00fcttenverein''). A year later, and once again in Schalke, he founded the Glass and Mirror Factory Incorporated (''Glas- und Spiegel-Manufaktur AG'').\n\nAfter Gelsenkirchen had become an important heavy-industry hub, it was raised to city in 1875.\n\n===Independent city===\n[[File:Gelsenkirchen nordstern.jpg|thumb|left|Former Zeche Nordstern]]\n[[File:Gelsenkirchen altstadt.jpg|thumb|left|Contrasts in the inner-city]]\nIn 1885, after Bochum district was split up, Gelsenkirchen became the seat of its own district (''Kreis''), which would last until 1926. The cities of Gelsenkirchen and Wattenscheid, as well as the [[Amt (administrative division)|\u00c4mter]] of Braubauerschaft (in 1900, Bismarck), Schalke, \u00dcckendorf, [[Wanne-Eickel|Wanne]] and [[Wattenscheid]] all belonged to the Gelsenkirchen district. A few years later, in 1896, Gelsenkirchen split off from Gelsenkirchen district to become an [[independent city]] ({{lang-de|kreisfreie Stadt}}). In 1891, Horst was split off from the ''Amt'' of Buer, which itself was raised to city status in 1911, and to an independent city status the next year. Meanwhile, Horst became the seat of its own ''Amt''. In 1924, the rural community of [[Flugwerk Deutschland GmbH|Rotthausen]], which until then had belonged to the [[Essen]] district, was made part of the Gelsenkirchen district.\n\nIn 1928, under the Prussian local government reforms, the cities of Gelsenkirchen and Buer along with the ''Amt'' of Horst together became a new ''kreisfreie Stadt'' called Gelsenkirchen-Buer, effective on 1 April that year. From that time, the whole city area belonged to the governmental district of M\u00fcnster. In 1930, on the city's advice, the city's name was changed to ''Gelsenkirchen'', effective 21 May. By this time, the city was home to about 340,000 people.\n\nIn 1931, the Gelsenkirchen Mining Corporation ({{lang-de|Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks-Aktien-Gesellschaft}}) founded the Gelsenberg Petrol Corporation ({{lang-de|Gelsenberg-Benzin-AG}}). In 1935, the Hibernia Mining Company founded the ''Hydrierwerk Scholven AG GE-Buer'' [[Coal liquefaction]] plant. Scholven/Buer began operation in 1936 and achieved a capacity of \"''200,000 tons/year of finished product, mainly aviation base gasoline.''\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071108041008/http://www.fischer-tropsch.org/Bureau_of_Mines/info_circ/ic_7375/ic_7375.htm] After 1937, Gelsenberg-Benzin-AG opened the Nordstern plant for converting bituminous coal to synthetic oil.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Becker |first=Peter W. |year=1981 |title=The Role of Synthetic Fuel In World War II Germany: implications for today? |url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1981/jul-aug/becker.htm |journal=Air University Review |location=[[Maxwell Air Force Base]] |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222003452/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1981/jul-aug/becker.htm |archive-date=22 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Nazi Germany===\nThe [[November 9 in German history|9 November 1938]] [[Kristallnacht]] antisemitic riots destroyed Jewish businesses, dwellings and cemeteries, and a [[synagogue]] in Buer and one in downtown Gelsenkirchen. However, a new downtown Gelsenkirchen synagogue was opened on 1 February 2007.\n\nGelsenkirchen was a target of [[strategic bombing during World War II]], particularly during the 1943 [[Battle of the Ruhr]] and the [[Oil Campaign of World War II|Oil Campaign]]. Three quarters of Gelsenkirchen was destroyed<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/gelsenkirchen/a-1533348 \"World Cup 2006 \u2013 Gelsenkirchen\"], [[Deutsche Welle]], 19 October 2005</ref> and many above-ground [[air-raid shelter]]s such as near the town hall in Buer are in nearly original form.\n\n[[Oberst]] [[Werner M\u00f6lders]] the legendary [[Luftwaffe]] Fighter pilot was born here.\n\nThe [[Gelsenberg Lager]] subcamp of [[KZ Buchenwald]] was established in 1944<ref>Edward Victor.

In 1994, the Institute for City History opened the documentation centre \"Gelsenkirchen under National Socialism\" ({{Lang|de|Dokumentationsst\u00e4tte \"Gelsenkirchen im Nationalsozialismus\"}}).\n\n===After the war===\nOn 17 December 1953, the ''Kokerei Hassel'' went into operation, billed as Germany's \"first new [[coking plant]]\" since the war. When [[postal code]]s (''Postleitzahlen'') were introduced in 1961, Gelsenkirchen was one of the few cities in [[West Germany]] to be given two codes: Buer was given 466, while Gelsenkirchen got 465. These were in use until 1 July 1993. The \"first [[comprehensive school]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]\" was opened in 1969. Scholven-Chemie AG (the old hydrogenation plant) merged with Gelsenberg-Benzin-AG to form the new corporation VEBA-Oel AG. In 1987, [[Pope John Paul II]] celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] before 85,000 people at Gelsenkirchen's Parkstadion. The Pope also became an honorary member of [[FC Schalke 04]].\n\nIn 1997, the Federal Garden Show (''Bundesgartenschau'' or ''BUGA'') was held on the grounds of the disused {{Interlanguage link|Zeche Nordstern|de|lt=Nordstern}} [[coalmine]] in Horst. In 1999, the last phase of the [[Internationale Bauausstellung Emscher Park]], an undertaking that brought together many cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, was held. [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] was produced at the old Hassel coking works for the last time on 29 September 1999. This marked the shutdown of the last coking plant in Gelsenkirchen, after being a coking town for more than 117 years. In the same year, Shell Solar Deutschland AG took over production of [[photovoltaic]] equipment. On 28 April 2000, the Ewald-Hugo colliery closed &ndash; Gelsenkirchen's last colliery. Three thousand coalminers lost their jobs. In 2003, Buer celebrated its thousandth anniversary of first documentary mention, and FC Schalke 04 celebrated on 4 May 2004 its hundredth anniversary.\n\nToday, Gelsenkirchen is a centre for sciences, services, and production, with good infrastructure.\n\n{{wide image|Gelsenkirchen Altstadt Panorama.jpg|2000px|Panorama of Gelsenkirchen}}\n{{clear|left}}\n===Jewish history===\n\n====19th century====\nThe [[Jewish]] community of Gelsenkirchen was officially established in 1874, relatively late compared to the Jewish [[Ashkenazi]] communities in Germany. In a list of 1829 to determine the salary for the [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Westphalia]], {{Interlanguage link|Abraham Sutro|de}}, three families were named: the families of Ruben Levi, Reuben Simon, and Herz Heimann families.<ref name=\"talmud.de\">[http://www.talmud.de/gelsenkirchen/ \"Das Judentum in Gelsenkirchen\"], by Chajm Guski {{in lang|de}}</ref> With the growth of the town during the second half of the 20th century, its Jewish population also grew bigger, with about 120 Jews living in town in 1880, and a [[synagogue]] established in 1885. With the growth of the community, a bigger building was built to serve as the community school.<ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07162.html Gelsenkirchen], Jewish Virtual Library</ref>\n\n====20th century====\nThe community continued to grow and around 1,100 Jews were living in Gelsenkirchen in 1901, a number that reached its peak of 1,300 individuals in 1933. At the turn of the 20th century the [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] community was the most dominant among all Jewish communities in town, and after an [[Organ (music)|organ]] was installed inside the synagogue, and most prayers performed mostly in German instead of traditional Hebrew, the town [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] community decided to stop its attendance of the synagogue and tried to establish a new orthodox community, led by Dr. Max Meyer, Dr. Rubens and Abraham Fr\u00f6hlich, most of them living on Florastra\u00dfe.<ref name=\"talmud.de\" /> In addition, another Jewish orthodox congregation of Polish Jews was found in town.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: A\u2013J'' by Shmuel Spector and Geoffrey Wigoder, NYU Press 2001, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=MFn3KeENnA0C&pg=PA422#v=onepage&q=Gelsenkirchen&f=false p. 422], {{ISBN|9780814793565}}</ref> In 1908, a lot on Wanner Stra\u00dfe was purchased and served the community as its cemetery until 1936, today containing about 400 graves.<ref name=\"talmud.de\" /> In addition, another cemetery was built in 1927 in the suburb of {{Interlanguage link|\u00dcckendorf|de}}.\n\n====Nazi Germany====\nWith the rise of [[Hitler]] and [[National Socialism]] in 1933, Jewish life in Gelsenkirchen was still relatively quiet. In August 1938, 160 Jewish businesses were still open in town. In October 1938, though, an official ban restricted these businesses and all Jewish doctors became unemployed. In the same month, the Jewish community of town was expelled. Between 1937 and 1939, the Jewish population of Gelsenkirchen dropped from 1,600 to 1,000. During [[Kristallnacht]], the town synagogue was destroyed, after two thirds of the town's Jewish population had already left. On 27 January 1942, 350 among the 500 remaining Jews in town were deported to the [[Riga Ghetto]]; later, the last remaining Jews were deported to Warsaw and [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]].\n\n====The Gelsenkirchen transport====\nOn 31 March 1942, a Nazi deportation train set out from Gelsenkirchen and, carrying 48 Jews from the town area, made its way to the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. The train was the first to deport Jews to Warsaw and not to [[Trawniki concentration camp]] in southern Poland, as used before. After it left Gelsenkirchen, the train was boarded by other Jews from [[M\u00fcnster]], [[Dortmund]] and a few other stops along the way, and mostly by the Jews of [[Hanover]], 500 in number. The arrival of this transport from Westphalia and Upper Saxony was recorded in his diaries by Adam Czerniakov, the last chairman of the Warsaw Ghetto [[Judenrat]]. He stated that those older than 68 were allowed to stay in Germany. The majority of these deportees were killed later on the different death sites around modern day Poland.<ref>[http://www.blankgenealogy.com/holocaust/Transports/Germany/March%2031%201942%20Deportation%20Transport%20from%20Gelsenkirchen%20to%20Warsaw%20Ghetto.pdf March 31, 1942, Deportation from Gelsenkirchen to Warsaw Ghetto]  (English), citing A.

In 2005, about 450 Jews were living in town. During the last decade of the 20th century, a noted number of Jews came to the town, after emigrating out of the former USSR. This situation made it necessary to extend the synagogue. Eventually, a new and bigger synagogue was built to serve the increasing Jewish community of Gelsenkirchen. The current community practices Orthodox Judaism, even though no family practices it at home.<ref name=\"talmud.de\" /> On 16 May 2014, antisemitic graffiti were painted on the town synagogue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://antisemitism.org.il/article/87383/swastika-synagogue-old-city|title=CFCA \u2013 Swastika on synagogue in an old city|work=antisemitism.org.il}}</ref>\n\n====Sites====\nThe building at Husemannstra\u00dfe 75 belonged to Dr. Max Meyer, who built it between 1920 and 1921.
