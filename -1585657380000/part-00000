The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of [[Osamu Tezuka]] and spread internationally in the late 20th century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by way of television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences.\n\nAnime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.{{sfn|Craig|2000|pp=139\u2013140}} The production of anime focuses less on the animation of movement and more on the realism of settings as well as the use of camera effects, including panning, zooming, and angle shots. Being hand-drawn, anime is separated from reality by a crucial gap of fiction that provides an ideal path for [[escapism]] that audiences can immerse themselves into with relative ease.{{sfn|Craig|2000|pp=139\u2013140}} Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, including characteristically large or realistically sized emotive eyes.\n\nThe anime industry consists of over 430 production studios, including major names like [[Studio Ghibli]], [[Gainax]], and [[Toei Animation]]. Despite comprising only a fraction of Japan's domestic film market, anime makes up a majority of Japanese [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] sales. It has also seen international success after the rise of English-[[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] and [[Subtitles|subbed]] programming. This rise in international popularity has resulted in non-Japanese productions using the anime art style. Whether these works are [[anime-influenced animation]] or proper anime is a subject for debate amongst fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aminoapps.com/c/anime/page/blog/does-anime-have-to-be-from-japan/mJtk_uDKj4NBmNZvjz1N2MJVrWe0X|title=Does Anime have to be from Japan? - Anime Amino|website=Anime - aminoapps.com|access-date=May 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522042414/https://aminoapps.com/c/anime/page/blog/does-anime-have-to-be-from-japan/mJtk_uDKj4NBmNZvjz1N2MJVrWe0X|archive-date=May 22, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Japanese anime accounted for 60% of the world's [[Animated series|animated television shows]] {{As of|2016||lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Napier |first1=Susan J. |title=Anime from Akira to Howl's Moving Castle: Experiencing Contemporary Japanese Animation |date=2016 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=9781250117724 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UnuLCwAAQBAJ&pg=PR10}}</ref> In 2015, the 44th [[President of the United States]], [[Barack Obama]], referred to anime as one of the loved ones of American youth.<ref>{{cite web|date=2015-04-28|title=Obama thanks Japan for karate, karaoke, anime, 'and, of course, emojis'\n|work=[[Politico]]|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/obama-shinzo-abe-visit-emoji-anime-karate-117416|accessdate=2020-01-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|work=[[Mashable]]|title=President Obama Thanks Japan's Prime Minister for Karaoke, Anime and Emoji|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-8zQC-9Iok|date=2015-04-28|accessdate=2020-01-18}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nAnime is an art form, specifically animation, that includes all [[genre]]s found in cinema, but it can be mistakenly classified as a genre.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=7}} In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the term ''anime'' is used as a [[blanket term]] to refer to all forms of animation from around the world.<ref name=\"japanese\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/__data/page/9842/Tezuka_Kit_1.pdf |title=Tezuka: The Marvel of Manga - Education Kit |year=2007 |publisher=Art Gallery New South Wales |accessdate=October 28, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830033821/http://artgallery.nsw.gov.au/__data/page/9842/Tezuka_Kit_1.pdf |archivedate=August 30, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> In English, ''anime'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|n|\u0259|\u02cc|m|e\u026a}}) is more restrictively used to denote a \"Japanese-style animated film or television entertainment\" or as \"a style of animation created in Japan\".<ref name=\"webster\"/><ref name=\"Oxford\">{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/anime|title=Anime|dictionary=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate=February 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202165231/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/anime|archive-date=February 2, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe etymology of the word ''anime'' is disputed.

As with a few other Japanese words such as ''[[sak\u00e9]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'', and ''[[Kobo Ab\u00e9]],'' English-language texts sometimes spell ''anime'' as ''anim\u00e9'' (as in French), with an [[acute accent]] over the final ''e'', to cue the reader to pronounce the letter, not to leave it silent as Standard English orthography may suggest.\n\nSome sources claim that ''anime'' derives from the French term for animation ''dessin anim\u00e9'',<ref name=\"etymology\"/>{{sfn|Schodt|1997}} but others believe this to be a myth derived from the French popularity of the medium in the late 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=anna/> In English, ''anime''\u2014when used as a common [[noun]]\u2014normally functions as a [[mass noun]].

While anime has been licensed by its Japanese owners for use outside Japan since at least the 1960s, the practice became well-established in the United States in the late 1970s to early 1980s, when such TV series as ''[[Gatchaman]]'' and ''[[Captain Harlock]]'' were licensed from their Japanese parent companies for distribution in the US market. The trend towards American distribution of anime continued into the 1980s with the licensing of titles such as ''[[Voltron (1984 TV series)|Voltron]]'' and the 'creation' of new series such as ''[[Robotech]]'' through use of source material from several original series.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=11}}\n\nIn the early 1990s, several companies began to experiment with the licensing of less children-oriented material. Some, such as [[A.D. Vision]], and [[Central Park Media]] and its imprints, achieved fairly substantial commercial success and went on to become major players in the now very lucrative American anime market. Others, such as [[AnimEigo]], achieved limited success. Many companies created directly by Japanese parent companies did not do as well, most releasing only one or two titles before completing their American operations.\n\nLicenses are expensive, often hundreds of thousands of dollars for one series and tens of thousands for one movie.<ref name=\"ADVcourt\">''[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-30/adv-court-documents-reveal-amounts-paid-for-29-anime-titles ADV Court Documents Reveal Amounts Paid for 29 Anime Titles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423194657/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-30/adv-court-documents-reveal-amounts-paid-for-29-anime-titles |date=April 23, 2012 }}''</ref> The prices vary widely; for example, ''[[Jinki: Extend]]'' cost only $91,000 to license while ''[[Kurau Phantom Memory]]'' cost $960,000.<ref name=\"ADVcourt\"/> Simulcast Internet streaming rights can be cheaper, with prices around $1,000-$2,000 an episode,<ref>''[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-09 The Anime Economy Part 3: Digital Pennies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502060952/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-09 |date=May 2, 2015 }}''</ref> but can also be more expensive, with some series costing more than {{USD|200,000}} per episode.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2016-09-09/.106251|title= Why Are Funimation And Crunchyroll Getting Married?|first= Justin|last= Sevakis|date= September 9, 2016|accessdate= September 10, 2016|work= [[Anime News Network]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160910033129/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2016-09-09/.106251|archive-date= September 10, 2016|url-status=live|df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe anime market for the United States was worth approximately $2.74&nbsp;billion in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-04-15/america-2009-anime-market-pegged-at-us%242.741-billion|title= America's 2009 Anime Market Pegged at US$2.741&nbsp;Billion|date= April 15, 2011|accessdate= December 29, 2013|work= [[Anime News Network]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131228095646/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-04-15/america-2009-anime-market-pegged-at-us%242.741-billion|archive-date= December 28, 2013|url-status=live|df= mdy-all}}</ref> Dubbed animation began airing in the United States in 2000 on networks like [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] and [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]].{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=18}} In 2005, this resulted in five of the top ten anime titles having previously aired on Cartoon Network.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=18}} As a part of localization, some [[Editing of anime in American distribution|editing]] of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non-Japanese culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://w3.salemstate.edu/~poehlkers/Emerson/Pokemon.html |title=Pokemon Case Study |publisher=W3.salemstate.edu |accessdate=November 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820181118/http://w3.salemstate.edu/%7Epoehlkers/Emerson/Pokemon.html |archive-date=August 20, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The cost of English localization averages US$10,000 per episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/02/24/ask-john-why-does-dubbing-cost-so-much/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |title=Ask John: Why Does Dubbing Cost So Much? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=October 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619020459/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/02/24/ask-john-why-does-dubbing-cost-so-much/ |archive-date=June 19, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for [[fansubs]], the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=206}} Fansubs, which were originally distributed on VHS bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s, have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=206}} Since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues, fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed.

The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of [[Osamu Tezuka]] and spread internationally in the late 20th century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by way of television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences.\n\nAnime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.{{sfn|Craig|2000|pp=139\u2013140}} The production of anime focuses less on the animation of movement and more on the realism of settings as well as the use of camera effects, including panning, zooming, and angle shots. Being hand-drawn, anime is separated from reality by a crucial gap of fiction that provides an ideal path for [[escapism]] that audiences can immerse themselves into with relative ease.{{sfn|Craig|2000|pp=139\u2013140}} Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, including characteristically large or realistically sized emotive eyes.\n\nThe anime industry consists of over 430 production studios, including major names like [[Studio Ghibli]], [[Gainax]], and [[Toei Animation]]. Despite comprising only a fraction of Japan's domestic film market, anime makes up a majority of Japanese [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] sales. It has also seen international success after the rise of English-[[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] and [[Subtitles|subbed]] programming. This rise in international popularity has resulted in non-Japanese productions using the anime art style. Whether these works are [[anime-influenced animation]] or proper anime is a subject for debate amongst fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aminoapps.com/c/anime/page/blog/does-anime-have-to-be-from-japan/mJtk_uDKj4NBmNZvjz1N2MJVrWe0X|title=Does Anime have to be from Japan? - Anime Amino|website=Anime - aminoapps.com|access-date=May 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522042414/https://aminoapps.com/c/anime/page/blog/does-anime-have-to-be-from-japan/mJtk_uDKj4NBmNZvjz1N2MJVrWe0X|archive-date=May 22, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Japanese anime accounted for 60% of the world's [[Animated series|animated television shows]] {{As of|2016||lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Napier |first1=Susan J. |title=Anime from Akira to Howl's Moving Castle: Experiencing Contemporary Japanese Animation |date=2016 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=9781250117724 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UnuLCwAAQBAJ&pg=PR10}}</ref> In 2015, the 44th [[President of the United States]], [[Barack Obama]], referred to anime as one of the loved ones of American youth.<ref>{{cite web|date=2015-04-28|title=Obama thanks Japan for karate, karaoke, anime, 'and, of course, emojis'\n|work=[[Politico]]|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/obama-shinzo-abe-visit-emoji-anime-karate-117416|accessdate=2020-01-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|work=[[Mashable]]|title=President Obama Thanks Japan's Prime Minister for Karaoke, Anime and Emoji|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-8zQC-9Iok|date=2015-04-28|accessdate=2020-01-18}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nAnime is an art form, specifically animation, that includes all [[genre]]s found in cinema, but it can be mistakenly classified as a genre.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=7}} In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the term ''anime'' is used as a [[blanket term]] to refer to all forms of animation from around the world.<ref name=\"japanese\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/__data/page/9842/Tezuka_Kit_1.pdf |title=Tezuka: The Marvel of Manga - Education Kit |year=2007 |publisher=Art Gallery New South Wales |accessdate=October 28, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830033821/http://artgallery.nsw.gov.au/__data/page/9842/Tezuka_Kit_1.pdf |archivedate=August 30, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> In English, ''anime'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|n|\u0259|\u02cc|m|e\u026a}}) is more restrictively used to denote a \"Japanese-style animated film or television entertainment\" or as \"a style of animation created in Japan\".<ref name=\"webster\"/><ref name=\"Oxford\">{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/anime|title=Anime|dictionary=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate=February 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202165231/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/anime|archive-date=February 2, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe etymology of the word ''anime'' is disputed.

As with a few other Japanese words such as ''[[sak\u00e9]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'', and ''[[Kobo Ab\u00e9]],'' English-language texts sometimes spell ''anime'' as ''anim\u00e9'' (as in French), with an [[acute accent]] over the final ''e'', to cue the reader to pronounce the letter, not to leave it silent as Standard English orthography may suggest.\n\nSome sources claim that ''anime'' derives from the French term for animation ''dessin anim\u00e9'',<ref name=\"etymology\"/>{{sfn|Schodt|1997}} but others believe this to be a myth derived from the French popularity of the medium in the late 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=anna/> In English, ''anime''\u2014when used as a common [[noun]]\u2014normally functions as a [[mass noun]].

While anime has been licensed by its Japanese owners for use outside Japan since at least the 1960s, the practice became well-established in the United States in the late 1970s to early 1980s, when such TV series as ''[[Gatchaman]]'' and ''[[Captain Harlock]]'' were licensed from their Japanese parent companies for distribution in the US market. The trend towards American distribution of anime continued into the 1980s with the licensing of titles such as ''[[Voltron (1984 TV series)|Voltron]]'' and the 'creation' of new series such as ''[[Robotech]]'' through use of source material from several original series.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=11}}\n\nIn the early 1990s, several companies began to experiment with the licensing of less children-oriented material. Some, such as [[A.D. Vision]], and [[Central Park Media]] and its imprints, achieved fairly substantial commercial success and went on to become major players in the now very lucrative American anime market. Others, such as [[AnimEigo]], achieved limited success. Many companies created directly by Japanese parent companies did not do as well, most releasing only one or two titles before completing their American operations.\n\nLicenses are expensive, often hundreds of thousands of dollars for one series and tens of thousands for one movie.<ref name=\"ADVcourt\">''[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-30/adv-court-documents-reveal-amounts-paid-for-29-anime-titles ADV Court Documents Reveal Amounts Paid for 29 Anime Titles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423194657/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-30/adv-court-documents-reveal-amounts-paid-for-29-anime-titles |date=April 23, 2012 }}''</ref> The prices vary widely; for example, ''[[Jinki: Extend]]'' cost only $91,000 to license while ''[[Kurau Phantom Memory]]'' cost $960,000.<ref name=\"ADVcourt\"/> Simulcast Internet streaming rights can be cheaper, with prices around $1,000-$2,000 an episode,<ref>''[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-09 The Anime Economy Part 3: Digital Pennies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502060952/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-09 |date=May 2, 2015 }}''</ref> but can also be more expensive, with some series costing more than {{USD|200,000}} per episode.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2016-09-09/.106251|title= Why Are Funimation And Crunchyroll Getting Married?|first= Justin|last= Sevakis|date= September 9, 2016|accessdate= September 10, 2016|work= [[Anime News Network]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160910033129/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2016-09-09/.106251|archive-date= September 10, 2016|url-status=live|df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe anime market for the United States was worth approximately $2.74 billion in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-04-15/america-2009-anime-market-pegged-at-us%242.741-billion|title= America's 2009 Anime Market Pegged at US$2.741 Billion|date= April 15, 2011|accessdate= December 29, 2013|work= [[Anime News Network]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131228095646/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-04-15/america-2009-anime-market-pegged-at-us%242.741-billion|archive-date= December 28, 2013|url-status=live|df= mdy-all}}</ref> Dubbed animation began airing in the United States in 2000 on networks like [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] and [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]].{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=18}} In 2005, this resulted in five of the top ten anime titles having previously aired on Cartoon Network.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=18}} As a part of localization, some [[Editing of anime in American distribution|editing]] of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non-Japanese culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://w3.salemstate.edu/~poehlkers/Emerson/Pokemon.html |title=Pokemon Case Study |publisher=W3.salemstate.edu |accessdate=November 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820181118/http://w3.salemstate.edu/%7Epoehlkers/Emerson/Pokemon.html |archive-date=August 20, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The cost of English localization averages US$10,000 per episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/02/24/ask-john-why-does-dubbing-cost-so-much/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |title=Ask John: Why Does Dubbing Cost So Much? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=October 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619020459/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/02/24/ask-john-why-does-dubbing-cost-so-much/ |archive-date=June 19, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for [[fansubs]], the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=206}} Fansubs, which were originally distributed on VHS bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s, have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=206}} Since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues, fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed.

''A Bend in the River'' has also been criticized for a perceived defence of European colonialism in Africa.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Rquote|left|The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it.|''A Bend in the River''|Opening line}}\nSet in an unnamed [[Africa]]n country after independence, the book is narrated by Salim, an ethnically Indian [[Muslim]] and a shopkeeper in a small but growing city in the country's remote interior. Salim observes the rapid changes in Africa with an outsider's distance.\n\nSalim grows up in the community of Indian traders on the east coast of Africa. Feeling insecure about his future in East Africa, he buys a business from Nazruddin in a town at \"a bend in the river\" in the heart of Africa. When he moves there he finds the town decrepit, a \"ghost town\", its former European suburb reclaimed by the bush, and many of its European vestiges ruined in a \"rage\" by the locals in response to their suppression and humiliation during colonial times. Old tribal distinctions have become important again. Salim trades in what people in the villages need: pencils and paper, pots and pans, other household utensils. Soon he is joined by an assistant, Metty, who comes from a family of house slaves his family had maintained in the east. One of his steady customers is Zabeth, a \"marchande\" from a village and a magician too. Zabeth has a son, Ferdinand, by a man of another tribe, and asks Salim to help him get educated. Ferdinand attends the local lyc\u00e9e run by Father Huismans, a Belgian priest who collects African masks and is considered a \"lover of Africa\". Life in the town is slowly improving. Salim's decision to move there seems to be vindicated when he learns that the Indian community on the east coast is being persecuted, but he still does not feel secure. Mahesh says of the local Africans that \"they are malins\", \"because they lived with the knowledge of men as prey\".<ref>{{harvp|Naipaul|1980|p=54f}}</ref> A rebellion breaks out and the Indian merchants live in fear. Soon white mercenaries appear and restore order. After peace has returned Father Huismans goes on a trip. He is killed by unknown assailants and nobody cares. Afterwards his collection of African masks is denounced as affront to African religion. An American visitor pillages most of the masks and ships them home as \"The richest products of the forest\".<ref>{{harvp|Naipaul|1980|p=84}}</ref>\n\nThe town now develops into a trading centre for the region. Government agencies spring up. European salesmen and visitors arrive. Salim's friends Mahesh and Shoba become successful with their new Bigburger franchise. The new army arrives, \"poachers of ivory and thieves of gold\".<ref>{{harvp|Naipaul|1980|p=91}}</ref> Portraits of the President, \"the Big Man\", are displayed everywhere. A new section of town is built, the \"State Domain\", to showcase the President's vision of a new Africa. Yet buildings are shoddy, the tractors at the agricultural centre never get put to work, and much of the Domain falls quickly into disrepair. Salim calls it a \"hoax\". The Domain is soon converted into a university and conference centre. \n\nSalim is visited by Indar, who grew up with him on the east coast, then went to England to study and now has become a lecturer at the new institution. He takes Salim to a party in the Domain to meet Yvette and Raymond. Raymond had been the advisor and mentor of the President. Although he is in charge of the Domain, he finds himself outside the centre of power. Loyal to the President, he continues to write for him, hoping to be recalled to the capital. \n\nSalim, whose experience with women has been limited to prostitutes, is intrigued by Yvette, Raymond's much younger wife. Later, after Indar departs with the steamer, Salim and Yvette start an adulterous affair right under Raymond's eyes. Eventually the liaison breaks down, Salim hitting her and spitting on her between the legs.\n\nRaymond's attempts to please the Big Man are not successful. Instead the President publishes \"a very small, brief book of thoughts, ''Maximes'', two or three thoughts to each page, each thought about four or five lines long\".<ref>{{harvp|Naipaul|1980|p=195}}</ref> Like others, Salim is forced to buy copies of the book for distribution. The local youth group displeases the President and is denounced in one of his propaganda speeches. As a result, unrest grows, corruption and extortion become more prevalent, and a \"Liberation Army\" forms underground. They reject the President, his cult of the black Madonna, his vision of Africa, and want to return to the \"truthful laws\" of the ancestors. \n\nSalim looks for a way out. He travels to London, where he meets Nazruddin. Nazruddin sold his business to Salim, moved to Uganda, left it because of persecution, moved then to Canada, left it because of its capitalistic rapaciousness, and finally landed in London, where he became a landlord. He bemoans the lack of security for honest businessmen: there is no safe place. Salim becomes engaged to Nazruddin's daughter, but soon returns to his place in Africa. Upon arrival he learns that his business has been expropriated under the President's new programme of \"radicalization\" and transferred to a local. Th\u00e9otime, a \"state trustee\", is ignorant and lazy, and retains Salim as manager and chauffeur. Salim recognises that all is lost. He has hidden some ivory on his property, but, betrayed by Metty, is found out and put in jail. He is presented to the commissioner, Ferdinand, who has moved up in the administration after receiving training in the capital. Ferdinand tells him that there is no safety, no hope, and that everybody is in fear of his life: \"We\u2019re all going to hell, and every man knows this in his bones. We\u2019re being killed. Nothing has any meaning.\"<ref>{{harvp|Naipaul|1980|p=272}}</ref> He sets Salim free and tells him to leave the country. Salim takes the last steamer before the President arrives. During the night there is a battle on the ship, as rebels try to kidnap it. The attack is repelled, but the attached barge, full of Africans, is snapped loose and drifts down the river.\n\n==Latin mottos==\n{{Rquote|left|{{lang|la|Miscerique probat populos at foedera jungi}}|''A Bend in the River''|Motto of the town}} This [[Latin phrase]] is still visible to Salim on the granite base of a ruined European monument near the dock. Later Father Huismans explains him its meaning. \"He approves of the mingling of the peoples and their bonds of union\", derived from [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]], Book IV, line 112. [[Aeneas]] lands on the shores of Africa, falls in love with Queen [[Dido]] and wants to settle, putting his mission, the migration to Italy, in danger. The gods intervene: they do not approve of a settlement in Africa nor of the mingling of the peoples.

''A Bend in the River'' has also been criticized for a perceived defence of European colonialism in Africa.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Rquote|left|The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it.|''A Bend in the River''|Opening line}}\nSet in an unnamed [[Africa]]n country after independence, the book is narrated by Salim, an ethnically Indian [[Muslim]] and a shopkeeper in a small but growing city in the country's remote interior. Salim observes the rapid changes in Africa with an outsider's distance.\n\nSalim grows up in the community of Indian traders on the east coast of Africa. Feeling insecure about his future in East Africa, he buys a business from Nazruddin in a town at \"a bend in the river\" in the heart of Africa. When he moves there he finds the town decrepit, a \"ghost town\", its former European suburb reclaimed by the bush, and many of its European vestiges ruined in a \"rage\" by the locals in response to their suppression and humiliation during colonial times. Old tribal distinctions have become important again. Salim trades in what people in the villages need: pencils and paper, pots and pans, other household utensils. Soon he is joined by an assistant, Metty, who comes from a family of house slaves his family had maintained in the east. One of his steady customers is Zabeth, a \"marchande\" from a village and a magician too. Zabeth has a son, Ferdinand, by a man of another tribe, and asks Salim to help him get educated. Ferdinand attends the local lyc\u00e9e run by Father Huismans, a Belgian priest who collects African masks and is considered a \"lover of Africa\". Life in the town is slowly improving. Salim's decision to move there seems to be vindicated when he learns that the Indian community on the east coast is being persecuted, but he still does not feel secure. Mahesh says of the local Africans that \"they are malins\", \"because they lived with the knowledge of men as prey\".<ref>{{harvp|Naipaul|1980|p=54f}}</ref> A rebellion breaks out and the Indian merchants live in fear. Soon white mercenaries appear and restore order. After peace has returned Father Huismans goes on a trip. He is killed by unknown assailants and nobody cares. Afterwards his collection of African masks is denounced as affront to African religion. An American visitor pillages most of the masks and ships them home as \"The richest products of the forest\".<ref>{{harvp|Naipaul|1980|p=84}}</ref>\n\nThe town now develops into a trading centre for the region. Government agencies spring up. European salesmen and visitors arrive. Salim's friends Mahesh and Shoba become successful with their new Bigburger franchise. The new army arrives, \"poachers of ivory and thieves of gold\".<ref>{{harvp|Naipaul|1980|p=91}}</ref> Portraits of the President, \"the Big Man\", are displayed everywhere. A new section of town is built, the \"State Domain\", to showcase the President's vision of a new Africa. Yet buildings are shoddy, the tractors at the agricultural centre never get put to work, and much of the Domain falls quickly into disrepair. Salim calls it a \"hoax\". The Domain is soon converted into a university and conference centre. \n\nSalim is visited by Indar, who grew up with him on the east coast, then went to England to study and now has become a lecturer at the new institution. He takes Salim to a party in the Domain to meet Yvette and Raymond. Raymond had been the advisor and mentor of the President. Although he is in charge of the Domain, he finds himself outside the centre of power. Loyal to the President, he continues to write for him, hoping to be recalled to the capital. \n\nSalim, whose experience with women has been limited to prostitutes, is intrigued by Yvette, Raymond's much younger wife. Later, after Indar departs with the steamer, Salim and Yvette start an adulterous affair right under Raymond's eyes. Eventually the liaison breaks down, Salim hitting her and spitting on her between the legs.\n\nRaymond's attempts to please the Big Man are not successful. Instead the President publishes \"a very small, brief book of thoughts, ''Maximes'', two or three thoughts to each page, each thought about four or five lines long\".<ref>{{harvp|Naipaul|1980|p=195}}</ref> Like others, Salim is forced to buy copies of the book for distribution. The local youth group displeases the President and is denounced in one of his propaganda speeches. As a result, unrest grows, corruption and extortion become more prevalent, and a \"Liberation Army\" forms underground. They reject the President, his cult of the black Madonna, his vision of Africa, and want to return to the \"truthful laws\" of the ancestors. \n\nSalim looks for a way out. He travels to London, where he meets Nazruddin. Nazruddin sold his business to Salim, moved to Uganda, left it because of persecution, moved then to Canada, left it because of its capitalistic rapaciousness, and finally landed in London, where he became a landlord. He bemoans the lack of security for honest businessmen: there is no safe place. Salim becomes engaged to Nazruddin's daughter, but soon returns to his place in Africa. Upon arrival he learns that his business has been expropriated under the President's new programme of \"radicalization\" and transferred to a local. Th\u00e9otime, a \"state trustee\", is ignorant and lazy, and retains Salim as manager and chauffeur. Salim recognises that all is lost. He has hidden some ivory on his property, but, betrayed by Metty, is found out and put in jail. He is presented to the commissioner, Ferdinand, who has moved up in the administration after receiving training in the capital. Ferdinand tells him that there is no safety, no hope, and that everybody is in fear of his life: \"We\u2019re all going to hell, and every man knows this in his bones. We\u2019re being killed. Nothing has any meaning.\"<ref>{{harvp|Naipaul|1980|p=272}}</ref> He sets Salim free and tells him to leave the country. Salim takes the last steamer before the President arrives. During the night there is a battle on the ship, as rebels try to kidnap it. The attack is repelled, but the attached barge, full of Africans, is snapped loose and drifts down the river.\n\n==Latin mottos==\n{{Rquote|left|{{lang|la|Miscerique probat populos at foedera jungi}}|''A Bend in the River''|Motto of the town}} This [[Latin phrase]] is still visible to Salim on the granite base of a ruined European monument near the dock. Later Father Huismans explains him its meaning. \"He approves of the mingling of the peoples and their bonds of union\", derived from [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]], Book IV, line 112. [[Aeneas]] lands on the shores of Africa, falls in love with Queen [[Dido]] and wants to settle, putting his mission, the migration to Italy, in danger. The gods intervene: they do not approve of a settlement in Africa nor of the mingling of the peoples. In the motto, however, three words were altered to reverse the original meaning.<ref>{{harvp|Naipaul|1980|p=62f}}</ref>\n\nA second Latin phrase is encountered by Salim: ''{{lang|la|Semper aliquod novi}}'', the motto of the lyc\u00e9e.

It is a marvellously well-balanced structure, notwithstanding the profusion of detail and overloading of rich ornamentation, which in no way interferes with the main architectural scheme. It is crowned by a dome in the early style of S. Mario at [[Montepulciano]]. For the same patron, he constructed the [[Palazzo Montalto]] near [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], with its skilful distribution of masses and tied decorative scheme of reliefs and festoons, impressive because of the dexterity with which the artist adapted the plan to the site at his disposal.\n\nAfter the cardinal's accession as Sixtus V, he appointed Fontana Architect Of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]], bestowing upon him, among other distinctions, the title of Knight of the Golden Spur. He added the lantern to the dome of St. Peter's and proposed the prolongation of the interior in a well-defined nave.\n\nOf more importance were the alterations he made in [[Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano]] (c. 1586), where he introduced into the loggia of the north facade an imposing double arcade of wide span and ample sweep, and probably added the two-story portico the ''Scala Santa''. This predilection for arcades as essential features of an architectural scheme was brought out in the fountains designed by Domenico and his brother Giovanni, e.g. the [[Fontana dell'Acqua Paola]], or the ''Fontana di Termini'' planned along the same lines.\n\nAmong secular buildings his strong restrained style, with its suggestion from [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]], is best exemplified in the [[Lateran Palace]] (begun in 1586), in which the vigorous application of sound structural principles and a power of co-ordination are undeniable, but also the utter lack of imagination and barren monotony of style.

It is a marvellously well-balanced structure, notwithstanding the profusion of detail and overloading of rich ornamentation, which in no way interferes with the main architectural scheme. It is crowned by a dome in the early style of S. Mario at [[Montepulciano]]. For the same patron, he constructed the [[Palazzo Montalto]] near [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], with its skilful distribution of masses and tied decorative scheme of reliefs and festoons, impressive because of the dexterity with which the artist adapted the plan to the site at his disposal.\n\nAfter the cardinal's accession as Sixtus V, he appointed Fontana Architect Of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]], bestowing upon him, among other distinctions, the title of Knight of the Golden Spur. He added the lantern to the dome of St. Peter's and proposed the prolongation of the interior in a well-defined nave.\n\nOf more importance were the alterations he made in [[Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano]] (c. 1586), where he introduced into the loggia of the north facade an imposing double arcade of wide span and ample sweep, and probably added the two-story portico the ''Scala Santa''. This predilection for arcades as essential features of an architectural scheme was brought out in the fountains designed by Domenico and his brother Giovanni, e.g. the [[Fontana dell'Acqua Paola]], or the ''Fontana di Termini'' planned along the same lines.\n\nAmong secular buildings his strong restrained style, with its suggestion from [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]], is best exemplified in the [[Lateran Palace]] (begun in 1586), in which the vigorous application of sound structural principles and a power of co-ordination are undeniable, but also the utter lack of imagination and barren monotony of style. It was characteristic of him to remain satisfied with a single solution to an architectural problem, as shown in the fact that he reapplied the motif of the Lateran Palace in the later part of the Vatican containing the present papal residence, and in the additions to the [[Quirinal Palace]].\n\nFontana also designed the transverse arms separating the courts of the Vatican.\n\n==Egyptian obelisks==\n[[File:1586 Rome obelisk erection.jpg|thumb|200px|Re-erection of the obelisk on Saint Peter's Square in 1586.]]\n[[File:Fountain in the pedestal of the obelisk in front of S.
