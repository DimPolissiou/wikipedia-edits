A. Degree]], writing [[Arrears|arrear]] examinations for years. His only friend, Nallathambi, owns a barber hair saloon shop, which he received as dowry for marrying a woman who was two months pregnant. Bhaskaran, during an arrear exam, happens to meet  Chandrika, a lecturer, and instantly gets attracted to her, though she disapproves of him because he attempted to [[Academic dishonesty|copy]] during the exam.\n\nBhaskaran lives with his widowed mother, Sivakami, his older brother Saravanan (a veterinarian) and his younger sister Nithya, who is a college student wanting to become a TV compere. When Saravanan falls in love and marries Nandhini, Bhaskaran discovers that Nandhini's younger sister is Chandrika, and wishes to marry her. When he approaches his family for the alliance, his unemployment is repeatedly mentioned, rankling him, so he leaves his house to prove himself.\n\nBhaskaran faces many obstacles in his path to prove himself. He is insulted by Chandrika's father, Shanmugasundaram, and does not even have a place to live. After many difficulties, Bhaskaran, with the support of Nallathambi, establishes a tutorial for [[tenth grade|Class X]] students. Nallathambi goes and gets money from Velpandi, a local don, who signs an agreement that if his son Paalpandi does not pass in his exam, he will take Nallathambi's property and make him work in his cow dung place.\n\nVelpandi reveals his family history: his father, in his Class X examination, forced his teacher to write the exam. Velpandi, during his exam, wrote only four words in his paper with a [[billhook]] symbol, blackmailing the teacher into making him pass or risk being killed. Velpandi's son Paalpandi sleeps in the exam hall and if anybody tries to wake him, he will bite the teacher's hand.\n\nHowever, in the end, Paalpandi starts to study and makes others listen in the class when Bhaskaran appoints a blind teacher. Despite early setbacks, Bhaskaran makes a very heavy profit on the deal, while his students top in the state and Paalpandi passes in his exam with good marks. Velpandi tears the agreement, offers Nallathambi a huge amount of money with no interest and appreciates him for making Paalpandi pass in the exams.\n\nIt also convinces Chandrika, who eventually reciprocates his love. However, Shanmugasundaram is against the marriage as he had once been insulted by a drunk Nallathambi as revenge for not having sanctioned a loan to Bhaskaran. Shiva, a supposed [[teetotalism|teetotaller]] and the son of a businessman who is Shanmugasundram's friend, is introduced as Chandrika's prospective groom. Bhaskaran then confronts Shiva, revealing to him that he loves Chandrika. The two get into a fight soon after, but when Shanmugasundaram arrives at the spot, he learns the truth: Shiva and Bhaskaran are now friends and the whole fight was just a drama set by Nallathambi, Shiva supports their marriage. Under Shiva and Bhaskaran's orders, a disappointed Shanmugasundaram is forced to unite Bhaskaran and Chandrika. In the end, it is revealed that the director called Shiva and told him to stop fighting and unite Bhaskaran and Chandrika.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Arya (actor)|Arya]] as Bhaskaran\n* [[Nayantara]] as Chandrika\n* [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] as \"Thala Thalapathy\" Nallathambi\n* [[Subbu Panchu Arunachalam|Subbu Panchu]] as Saravanan\n* [[Chitra Lakshmanan]] as Shanmugasundaram/mongoose mandaiya\n* [[Rajendran]] as Velpandi\n* [[Ashvin Raja]] as Paalpandi\n* [[Vijayalakshmi (Kannada actress)|Vijaylakshmi]] as Nandhini Saravanan\n* [[Lakshmi Ramakrishnan]] as Sivakami\n* [[Swaminathan]] as Matured Student\n* Monisha  as Nithya\n* [[Poorni]] as Annapoorani\n* [[Jiiva]] in a [[guest appearance]] as [[Siva Manasula Sakthi|Shiva]]\n* [[Shakeela]] as in a guest appearance as Parimala\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was officially launched on 19 November 2009 at the [[AVM Studios]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/gallery/Events/20146.html |title=Events \u2013 'Boss Engira Baskaran' Movie Launch |publisher=IndiaGlitz |date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> with the film starting shooting in December first week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/movies/fullstory.php?id=14920455 |title=Arya\u2019s Boss Engira Bhaskaran launched!|publisher=Sify |date=20 November 2009 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> Rajesh, following his [[sleeper hit]] ''[[Siva Manasula Sakthi]]'', decided to make another comedy film and to cast [[Arya (actor)|Arya]], who appeared in a cameo role in ''Siva Manasula Sakthi'', in the titular role,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/50850.html |title=Arya is Boss aka Baskaran \u2013 Tamil Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> while [[Jiiva]] in return would make a cameo appearance in the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southdreamz.com/2010/04/jeevas-reciprocations-for-boss.html |title=Jeeva's reciprocations for 'Boss' |publisher=Southdreamz.com |date=10 April 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009183456/http://www.southdreamz.com/2010/04/jeevas-reciprocations-for-boss.html |archive-date=9 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As the film's backdrop is set to be both village as well as city, the film was shot at various location including [[Thanjavur]], [[Mysore]] and [[Tiruchirappalli|Trichy]].<ref name=shoot>{{cite news|last=V Lakshmi|title=Director Rajesh gets talking to Whatt\u2019\u2019s Hot on his upcoming project Boss Engira Baskaran.....|url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&Source=Page&Skin=TOINEW&BaseHref=TOICH%2F2010%2F08%2F06&ViewMode=GIF&PageLabel=30&EntityId=Ar03002&AppName=1|accessdate=12 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref> A major part of the film was filmed at [[Kumbakonam]], while a few scenes were shot in [[Chennai]] as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/52594.html |title=Nayantara is with \u2018Boss Engira Baskaran\u2019! - Tamil Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/jan-10-01/nayanthara-boss-engira-baskaran-08-01-10.html |title=Nayan moves to Chennai |publisher=Behindwoods |date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> Shooting was also carried on in the [[Swiss Alps]], where some song sequences were picturized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/movies/tamil/fullstory.php?id=14946085 |title=Arya & Nayan goes to Swiss Alps|publisher=Sify |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chennaionline.com/movies/preview/Aarya-and-Nayantara-to-romance-in-Switzerland/20103925013912.col |title=Aarya and Nayantara to romance in Switzerland &#124; preview \u2013 Movies |publisher=ChennaiOnline |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> Principal photography ended on 3 August 2010 with the completion of the last song that was canned at a set erected at [[Buckingham and Carnatic Mills|Binny Mills]] near [[Chennai]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/movies/tamil/fullstory.php?id=14952026 |title=Boss Engira Bhaskaran shoot is complete|publisher=Sify |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> Arya revealed that the script went through changes during production, with Rajesh eventually opting not to include portions where Bhaskaran's brother gets killed in the film.

A. Degree]], writing [[Arrears|arrear]] examinations for years. His only friend, Nallathambi, owns a barber hair saloon shop, which he received as dowry for marrying a woman who was two months pregnant. Bhaskaran, during an arrear exam, happens to meet  Chandrika, a lecturer, and instantly gets attracted to her, though she disapproves of him because he attempted to [[Academic dishonesty|copy]] during the exam.\n\nBhaskaran lives with his widowed mother, Sivakami, his older brother Saravanan (a veterinarian) and his younger sister Nithya, who is a college student wanting to become a TV compere. When Saravanan falls in love and gets married to a woman named Nandhini, Bhaskaran discovers that Nandhini's younger sister is Chandrika, and wishes to marry her. When he approaches his family for the alliance, everyone talks of his unemployed status which rankles him and causes him to leave his house to prove himself.\n\nBhaskaran faces many obstacles in his path to prove himself. He is insulted by Chandrika's father, Shanmugasundaram, and does not even have a place to live. After many difficulties, Bhaskaran, with the support of Nallathambi, establishes a tutorial for [[tenth grade|Class X]] students. Nallathambi goes and gets money from Velpandi, a local don, who signs an agreement that if his son Paalpandi does not pass in his exam, he will take Nallathambi's property and make him work in his cow dung place.\n\nVelpandi reveals his family history: his father, in his Class X examination, forced his teacher to write the exam. Velpandi, during his exam, wrote only four words in his paper with a [[billhook]] symbol, blackmailing the teacher into making him pass or risk being killed. Velpandi's son Paalpandi sleeps in the exam hall and if anybody tries to wake him, he will bite the teacher's hand.\n\nHowever, in the end, Paalpandi starts to study and makes others listen in the class when Bhaskaran appoints a blind teacher. Despite early setbacks, Bhaskaran makes a very heavy profit on the deal, while his students top in the state and Paalpandi passes in his exam with good marks. Velpandi tears the agreement, offers Nallathambi a huge amount of money with no interest and appreciates him for making Paalpandi pass in the exams.\n\nIt also convinces Chandrika, who eventually reciprocates his love. However, Shanmugasundaram is against the marriage as he had once been insulted by a drunk Nallathambi as revenge for not having sanctioned a loan to Bhaskaran. Shiva, a supposed [[teetotalism|teetotaller]] and the son of a businessman who is Shanmugasundram's friend, is introduced as Chandrika's prospective groom. Bhaskaran then confronts Shiva, revealing to him that he loves Chandrika. The two get into a fight soon after, but when Shanmugasundaram arrives at the spot, he learns the truth: Shiva and Bhaskaran are now friends and the whole fight was just a drama set by Nallathambi, Shiva supports their marriage. Under Shiva and Bhaskaran's orders, a disappointed Shanmugasundaram is forced to unite Bhaskaran and Chandrika. In the end, it is revealed that the director called Shiva and told him to stop fighting and unite Bhaskaran and Chandrika.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Arya (actor)|Arya]] as Bhaskaran\n* [[Nayantara]] as Chandrika\n* [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] as \"Thala Thalapathy\" Nallathambi\n* [[Subbu Panchu Arunachalam|Subbu Panchu]] as Saravanan\n* [[Chitra Lakshmanan]] as Shanmugasundaram/mongoose mandaiya\n* [[Rajendran]] as Velpandi\n* [[Ashvin Raja]] as Paalpandi\n* [[Vijayalakshmi (Kannada actress)|Vijaylakshmi]] as Nandhini Saravanan\n* [[Lakshmi Ramakrishnan]] as Sivakami\n* [[Swaminathan]] as Matured Student\n* Monisha  as Nithya\n* [[Poorni]] as Annapoorani\n* [[Jiiva]] in a [[guest appearance]] as [[Siva Manasula Sakthi|Shiva]]\n* [[Shakeela]] as Parimala (guest appearance)\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was officially launched on 19 November 2009 at the [[AVM Studios]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/gallery/Events/20146.html |title=Events \u2013 'Boss Engira Baskaran' Movie Launch |publisher=IndiaGlitz |date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> with the film starting shooting in December first week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/movies/fullstory.php?id=14920455 |title=Arya\u2019s Boss Engira Bhaskaran launched!|publisher=Sify |date=20 November 2009 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> Rajesh, following his [[sleeper hit]] ''[[Siva Manasula Sakthi]]'', decided to make another comedy film and to cast [[Arya (actor)|Arya]], who appeared in a cameo role in ''Siva Manasula Sakthi'', in the titular role,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/50850.html |title=Arya is Boss aka Baskaran \u2013 Tamil Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> while [[Jiiva]] in return would make a cameo appearance in the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southdreamz.com/2010/04/jeevas-reciprocations-for-boss.html |title=Jeeva's reciprocations for 'Boss' |publisher=Southdreamz.com |date=10 April 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009183456/http://www.southdreamz.com/2010/04/jeevas-reciprocations-for-boss.html |archive-date=9 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As the film's backdrop is set to be both village as well as city, the film was shot at various location including [[Thanjavur]], [[Mysore]] and [[Tiruchirappalli|Trichy]].<ref name=shoot>{{cite news|last=V Lakshmi|title=Director Rajesh gets talking to Whatt\u2019\u2019s Hot on his upcoming project Boss Engira Baskaran.....|url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&Source=Page&Skin=TOINEW&BaseHref=TOICH%2F2010%2F08%2F06&ViewMode=GIF&PageLabel=30&EntityId=Ar03002&AppName=1|accessdate=12 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref> A major part of the film was filmed at [[Kumbakonam]], while a few scenes were shot in [[Chennai]] as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/52594.html |title=Nayantara is with \u2018Boss Engira Baskaran\u2019! - Tamil Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/jan-10-01/nayanthara-boss-engira-baskaran-08-01-10.html |title=Nayan moves to Chennai |publisher=Behindwoods |date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> Shooting was also carried on in the [[Swiss Alps]], where some song sequences were picturized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/movies/tamil/fullstory.php?id=14946085 |title=Arya & Nayan goes to Swiss Alps|publisher=Sify |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chennaionline.com/movies/preview/Aarya-and-Nayantara-to-romance-in-Switzerland/20103925013912.col |title=Aarya and Nayantara to romance in Switzerland &#124; preview \u2013 Movies |publisher=ChennaiOnline |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> Principal photography ended on 3 August 2010 with the completion of the last song that was canned at a set erected at [[Buckingham and Carnatic Mills|Binny Mills]] near [[Chennai]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/movies/tamil/fullstory.php?id=14952026 |title=Boss Engira Bhaskaran shoot is complete|publisher=Sify |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> Arya revealed that the script went through changes during production, with Rajesh eventually opting not to include portions where Bhaskaran's brother gets killed in the film.

It lies among the northern ranges of the [[Karancs Hills]] in its valley. Karancsalja is bordered by [[Karancsber\u00e9ny]] in the north, [[Karancslapujt\u0151]] in the west, [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]] in the east and [[Etes]] in the south. It lies near the border between Hungary and Slovakia. \n\nKarancsalja must have been inhabited since the time of the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian conquest]], since its area - the northern side of the valley - is slightly raised from its surroundings, thus providing a suitable place for settlement.\n\nLike the settlements of the Karancs region, Karancsalja was a typical village on a highway at the beginning of its history, and it was established along the road connecting the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Great Plain]] and the [[North Hungarian Mountains|Highlands]]. Until the middle of the 19th century, this was an important route for the county and even for the country. The traffic here had considerable economic power.\n\nDespite its favorable geographical conditions, Karancsalja did not become a large settlement, although in the second half of the 19th century, with the emergence and rapid development of mining, the village began to grow. More than 1500 people live in Karancsalja today.\n\n== Location ==\nThe village is located in the northeastern part of [[N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County|N\u00f3gr\u00e1d]] county, in the valley of the Dobroda stream, in the valley of the Karancs Hills, five kilometers northwest of Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n.\n\nThe easiest way to reach Karancsalja is by road 2206 between [[Litke, Hungary|Litke]] and Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n, it is the first settlement from the county capital.\n\nIt is also accessible from the main road 22, from where one has to turn east-northeast in [[S\u00e1g\u00fajfalu]], to the 7 km-long side road 22109 through Etes.\n\nFootpaths and forest tracks are available from the village to the [[Karancs Hills]].\u00a0\n\n== History ==\nKarancsalja is a settlement of the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1dian age]] in the valley of the Dobroda stream.\n\nIt was named after the 727 meters high [[Karancs]] peak, which is situated a few kilometers northeast of the village, on the border of Slovakia and Hungary, is also called \"[[Pal\u00f3c]] Olympus\".\n\nThe village already existed in the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1dian period]]. According to legend, in 1241 King [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|Bela IV]] found refuge there one night when he had to flee after bloody [[battle of Mohi]] against the [[Tat\u00e1rj\u00e1r\u00e1s (disambiguation)|Tatars]]. Tradition holds that the King's daughter, [[Margaret of Hungary (saint)|St. Margaret]], built the Margaret Chapel on the summit of Karancs to commemorate this famous event.\n\nThe history of the village during the [[Ottoman Hungary|Turkish occupation]] and in the late medieval period is rather unexamined.\n\nIn 1548 it was owned by Ferenc Bebek.\n\nIn 1715, the census recorded 8, and in 1720, 14 Hungarian households.\n\nIn 1770 L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Jankovich, at the beginning of the 19th century Antal Jankovics, and in the early 1900s G\u00e9za Balla were the most important landowners of the village.\n\nThe mansion in the village was built by Mikl\u00f3s Jankovich at the beginning of the 19th century, but was rebuilt by it\u2019s new owner in 1909.\n\nIn 1873 a large cholera epidemic devastated the settlement.\n\nThe coal mines on the outskirts of Karancsalja were of great importance to the life of the population, providing a livelihood for many people in the 19th and 20th centuries. At the end of 1944, the Karancslejt\u0151s mine at Etes, a few kilometers from the village, was a scene of a \u00a0tragic event when seven of the miners who refused to work, in order to get better conditions, were shot dead.\u00a0\n\n== Population ==\nIn 2001, 99% of the population of the settlement declared themselves to be Hungarian and 1% Romani.\n\nAt the 2011 census, 88.5% of the population said they were Hungarian, 2.9% Romani, 0.3% German, 0.3% Slovak (11.5% did not answer; due to dual identities, the total may be more than 100%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ksh.hu/apps/hntr.telepules?p_lang=EN&p_id=18625|title=Detailed Gazetteer of Hungary|website=www.ksh.hu|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe distribution of religion was as follows: Roman Catholic 47.4%, Reformed 1.9%, Lutheran 0.8%, non-denominational 22.3% (25.6% did not answer). \n\n== The village today ==\nThe infrastructure (water, gas, drainage, telephone, cable TV) is fully developed, the roads have been renovated.

Released by Columbia Pictures on July 23, 1944, it stars [[El Brendel]] and [[Shemp Howard]], both of whom receive top-billing in the short.\n\n==Plot==\nElmer (El Brendel) and Axel (Shemp Howard) are two vagrants who are on trial for wrecking a policeman's motorcycle. The judge (John Tyrell) fines them $100 or they go to jail for 100 days. The two men convince the judge to let them get a job to pay the fine, which he accepts. They end up getting a job as assistant plumbers, even though they know nothing about plumbing. The boys also find themselves in hot water when they unknowingly assault a customer in the shop, who turns out to be the judge. Their first assignment is to locate a ring that fell down in a sink at a mansion where a bridge club game is going on. They destroy the bathroom and the rest of the house until they finally retrieve the ring at the end.\n\n==Production notes==\n''Pick a Peck of Plumbers'' is a remake of 1934's ''Plumbing For Gold'' starring [[George Sidney]] and [[Charles Murray (American actor)|Charlie Murray]]. It was partially reworked with [[The Three Stooges]] as ''[[A Plumbing We Will Go]]'' (1940) and ''[[Vagabond Loafers]]'' (1949). It was remade by the Stooges again in 1956 as ''[[Scheming Schemers]]''.<ref name=Solomon>{{cite book| last = Solomon| first = Jon| authorlink = | title = The Complete Three Stooges: The Official Filmography and Three Stooges Companion| publisher = Comedy III Productions, Inc| date = 2002| location = | url = https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Three-Stooges-Filmography-Companion/dp/0971186804/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201570359&sr=1-1 | doi =| id = | isbn = 0-9711868-0-4| pages = 171\u2013172}}</ref>\n\nIn 1944, the shorts department at Columbia paired Brendel with different comedians since they did not know what to do with him. Brendel and Howard did not really click together as a team.

Released by Columbia Pictures on July 23, 1944, it stars [[El Brendel]] and [[Shemp Howard]], both of whom receive top-billing in the short.\n\n==Plot==\nElmer (El Brendel) and Axel (Shemp Howard) are two vagrants who are on trial for wrecking a policeman's motorcycle. The judge (John Tyrell) fines them $100 or they go to jail for 100 days. The two men convince the judge to let them get a job to pay the fine, which he accepts. They end up getting a job as assistant plumbers, even though they know nothing about plumbing. The boys also find themselves in hot water when they unknowingly assault a customer in the shop, who turns out to be the judge. Their first assignment is to locate a ring that fell down in a sink at a mansion where a bridge club game is going on. They destroy the bathroom and the rest of the house until they finally retrieve the ring at the end.\n\n==Production notes==\n''Pick a Peck of Plumbers'' is a remake of 1934's ''Plumbing For Gold'' starring [[George Sidney]] and [[Charles Murray (American actor)|Charlie Murray]]. It was partially reworked with [[The Three Stooges]] as ''[[A Plumbing We Will Go]]'' (1940) and ''[[Vagabond Loafers]]'' (1949). It was remade by the Stooges again in 1956 as ''[[Scheming Schemers]]''.<ref name=Solomon>{{cite book| last = Solomon| first = Jon| authorlink = | title = The Complete Three Stooges: The Official Filmography and Three Stooges Companion| publisher = Comedy III Productions, Inc| date = 2002| location = | url = https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Three-Stooges-Filmography-Companion/dp/0971186804/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201570359&sr=1-1 | doi =| id = | isbn = 0-9711868-0-4| pages = 171\u2013172}}</ref>\n\nIn 1944, the shorts department at Columbia paired Brendel with different comedians since they did not know what to do with him.

A film adaptation of both the novel and the musical is also in development.\n\n==Plot==\n''Be More Chill'' is written in the first person, from the perspective of high school student Jeremy Heere. Jeremy is considered a loser by his popular peers; the popular girls have no interest in him, and he is constantly bullied. Jeremy's best friend is the music-loving Michael Mell. They sit together at lunch and talk about Jeremy's attempts at wooing his longtime crush, Christine Caniglia. Jeremy is tired of being a loser and hopes to find a way to change this. His main goal in life is to get Christine to notice he is alive, and maybe eventually start dating her. Jeremy plans to implement his plans as he and Christine both practice for their school play, Shakespeare's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' His advances are slow-going at first.\n\nMichael tells Jeremy that he's vaguely heard of a pill that can improve your life; he thinks it's called a \"script\" and he suspects his brother used one to get a high SAT score.\n\nRich Goranski is a short-statured, but well-built part of the popular teen group that bullies Jeremy. He finds Jeremy at a school Halloween party and tells him about the SQUIP. A \"SQUIP\" (Super Quantum Unit Intel Processor) is a supercomputer in the form of a grey oblong pill made by Sony that can communicate directly with your brain after being swallowed. Jeremy decides to search for this \"SQUIP.\" The pill is used to become cooler and comes with different avatar voices such as Sean Connery, Keanu Reeves, a \"sexy anime female\", etc. Jeremy purchases the pill in the back of a Payless Shoe Store, in hopes of transforming himself from a klutzy loser to a member of the social elite to gain the attention of Christine.\n\t\nThe pill does just that: it instructs him on how to dress, act, talk, and generally comport himself through each day. He quickly gains the attention of Chloe, one of the most popular girls in the school, as well as Brooke, who Jeremy skips class to make out with. Rich stops bullying Jeremy, saying that it was his own SQUIP who was telling him to in order to be cooler.\n\nJeremy also slowly gains the attention of Christine, as he advances through the social ranks of Middle Borough High School. However, this does come with a price: neglecting his friendship with Michael. Jeremy's SQUIP tells him that Michael is beyond his help and will never be cool, but Jeremy demands that his SQUIP helps Michael. It obliges. Later Michael and Jeremy attend a house party, where Jeremy is forced to hook up with Chloe Valentine, and Rich starts acting deranged. The next morning, Jeremy is woken up to the news that Rich had burned down the house from the previous night and is in the hospital.\n\nThe SQUIP comes up with the ultimate foolproof plan to get Christine to fall for Jeremy during the school play. Halfway through the play, after Jeremy's character is \"revived\" by Christine's, the plan comes into play. Jeremy begins by saying how he's praying for Rich to recover, and how Christine inspired him to join the play. He then professes his love for Christine and asks her to go out with him. Christine, staying in character, is angry at him for disrupting the play, but they continue out the rest of the scene awkwardly. Jeremy tries asking his SQUIP for advice on what to do next and to continue helping him remember his lines, but it does not respond. The drama teacher and play director, Mr. Reyes, then kicks Jeremy out for breaking character. Michael comes across a distraught Jeremy who confesses he acquired a SQUIP that has been influencing him for the last few months. Michael reveals he knew what SQUIPs really were the entire time, and told Jeremy a fake name because he knew that Jeremy would want one if he knew.\n\nThe SQUIP returns, apologizing to Jeremy for what he's done, asking to be deactivated as he is apparently faulty, and recommending Jeremy get a new model when it is released. He says that Mountain Dew Code Red will deactivate him. Before he does this, they come up with the idea to do a \"data dump\", or recall everything in Jeremy's head since the time of him being into Christine, in hopes that she will understand his feelings and why he did what he did. The implication is that the novel itself is the product of this \"data dump\" and becomes the in-universe book intended for Christine.\n\n==Characters ==\n*Jeremy Heere: The protagonist (also the one who screws everythig up :0)\n*Michael Mell: Jeremy's best friend \n*Christine Caniglia: Jeremy\u2019s love interest\n*Rich Goranski: Jeremy's vertically challenged bully, also has a SQUIP\n*Jake Dillinger: Christine's love interest at the beginning of the book\n*Chloe Valentine: One of the three hottest girls in Jeremy's grade.

The next morning, Jeremy is woken up to the news that Rich had burned down the house from the previous night and is in the hospital.\n\nThe SQUIP comes up with the ultimate foolproof plan to get Christine to fall for Jeremy during the school play. Halfway through the play, after Jeremy's character is \"revived\" by Christine's, the plan comes into play. Jeremy begins by saying how he's praying for Rich to recover, and how Christine inspired him to join the play. He then professes his love for Christine and asks her to go out with him. Christine, staying in character, is angry at him for disrupting the play, but they continue out the rest of the scene awkwardly. Jeremy tries asking his SQUIP for advice on what to do next and to continue helping him remember his lines, but it does not respond. The drama teacher and play director, Mr. Reyes, then kicks Jeremy out for breaking character. Michael comes across a distraught Jeremy who confesses he acquired a SQUIP that has been influencing him for the last few months. Michael reveals he knew what SQUIPs really were the entire time, and told Jeremy a fake name because he knew that Jeremy would want one if he knew.\n\nThe SQUIP returns, apologizing to Jeremy for what he's done, asking to be deactivated as he is apparently faulty, and recommending Jeremy get a new model when it is released. He says that Mountain Dew Code Red will deactivate him. Before he does this, they come up with the idea to do a \"data dump\", or recall everything in Jeremy's head since the time of him being into Christine, in hopes that she will understand his feelings and why he did what he did. The implication is that the novel itself is the product of this \"data dump\" and becomes the in-universe book intended for Christine.\n\n==Characters ==\n*Jeremy Heere: The protagonist\n*Michael Mell: Jeremy's best friend \n*Christine Caniglia: Jeremy\u2019s love interest\n*Rich Goranski: Jeremy's vertically challenged bully, also has a SQUIP\n*Jake Dillinger: Christine's love interest at the beginning of the book\n*Chloe Valentine: One of the three hottest girls in Jeremy's grade.

[[Scotland]] is the only part of the [[United Kingdom]] where Humanist weddings are recognised as legal by the state and is only one of eight countries in the world where Humanist weddings are legally recognised, the others as of 2017 are: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] and some states of the [[United States of America]].\n\nCelebrants differ from [[Chaplains]] in that Celebrants serve the unaffiliated public at large, while Chaplains are usually employed by an institution such as a hospital or other health care facility, the military, etc. However some celebrants of [[Humanist Society Scotland]] perform [[Chaplain]] duties at Scottish education establishments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Humanist Chaplain|url=http://www.gcu.ac.uk/student/faith/chaplains/humanistchaplain/|publisher=Glasgow Caledonian University|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n{{main|Celebrant (Australia)}}\nIn Australia, Celebrants have a slightly different role, as regulated by local and national laws.\n\n==By faith==\n[[File:Ev Stadtkirche Ravensburg innen.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Lutheran]] minister in Germany marries a young couple.]]\n\n===Christianity===\n{{Further|Marriage#Christianity}}\n\n====Catholicism====\nIn the [[Catholic Church]], it is the bride and groom who perform the [[Catholic marriage|Sacrament of Matrimony]] (marriage), but a marriage can only be valid if the Church has a witness at the wedding ceremony whose function is to question the couple to ensure that they have no obstacle to marriage (such as an [[Annulment|un-annulled]] previous marriage or certain undisclosed facts between the couple) and that they are freely choosing to wed each other.\n\nAll ordained clergy (i.e. a [[deacon]], [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]], or [[bishop]]) may witness the wedding ceremony itself, though usually the wedding ceremony occurs during a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], which deacons lack the authority or ability to celebrate; however, in weddings that take place inside Mass, the deacon may still serve as the witness to the wedding, provided that a priest or bishop celebrates the Mass; and in weddings that take place outside Mass (which usually occurs in a marriage between a Catholic and a non-Christian or, less often, non-Catholic), the ceremony is the same for deacons, priests, and bishops (with few or no changes).\n\n====Protestantism====\nProtestant weddings are conducted by a minister or pastor, depending on Christian denomination.\n\n====Quaker====\nIn [[Quaker]] weddings the couple marry each other with no third party officiating.\n\n===Islam===\nIslamic weddings are performed by Imams.\n\n===Judaism===\n{{main|Jewish wedding}}\nIn [[Judaism]], a [[Rabbi]] officiates Jewish weddings. However, the Rabbi's function is to ensure that the Jewish religious laws of the wedding ceremony are followed, particularly making sure that the Jewish witnesses are valid.  The Rabbi traditionally recites the blessing for the ceremony on behalf of the groom, although in ancient times the groom would have recited this blessing.\n\n===Non-religious===\n====Non-denominational====\nSome organizations have limited or no requirements for ordination, like [[American Marriage Ministries]] and the [[Universal Life Church]]. Such organizations may be known as [[ordination mill]]s, however in most cases, their ordinations provide the same legal standing as mainstream officiants, and marriage licenses signed such organizations are valid and recognized.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/fashion/05marry.html|title=Great Wedding!

In [[Humanism|Humanist]] weddings, a [[Humanist officiant]] presides.\n\nCelebrants may perform alternative and nontraditional [[ceremony|ceremonies]] in places, and under circumstances where mainstream religious [[clergy]] will not. Some celebrants perform [[same-sex weddings]] and [[commitment ceremonies]]. Celebrants, also called [[officiant]]s, often perform ceremonies in parks, on beaches, on mountains, on boats, on hiking trails, in hotels, in banquet halls, in private homes, and many other places.\n\nLaws in each state of the United States vary about who has the ability to perform wedding ceremonies, but celebrants or officiants are usually categorized as \"clergy\" and have the same rights and responsibilities as ordained clergy. There is some controversy over whether these laws promote religious privilege that is incompatible with the United States Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/08/21/this-non-profit-is-fighting-give-non-religious-couples-more-choice-who-marries-them-texas-just-dealt-them-setback/|title=This nonprofit is fighting to give nonreligious couples more choice in who marries them.

The main elements common to all gas turbine engines are:\n* an upstream rotating [[gas compressor]]\n* a [[combustor]]\n* a downstream [[turbine]] on the same shaft as the compressor.\n\nA fourth component is often used to increase efficiency (on [[turboprop]]s and [[turbofan]]s), to convert power into mechanical or electric form (on [[turboshaft]]s and [[electric generator]]s), or to achieve greater [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] (on [[afterburner|afterburning]] engines).\n\nThe basic operation of the gas turbine is a [[Brayton cycle]] with air as the [[working fluid]]. Atmospheric air flows through the compressor that brings it to higher pressure. [[Energy]] is then added by spraying fuel into the air and igniting it so the combustion generates a high-temperature flow. This high-temperature high-pressure gas enters a turbine, where it expands down to the exhaust pressure, producing a shaft work output in the process. The turbine shaft work is used to drive the compressor; the energy that is not used for compressing the working fluid comes out in the [[exhaust gases]] that can be used to do external work, such as directly producing [[thrust]] in a turbojet engine, or rotating a second, independent turbine (known as a power turbine) which can be connected to a fan, propeller, or electrical generator.  The purpose of the gas turbine determines the design so that the most desirable split of energy between the thrust and the shaft work is achieved. The fourth step of the Brayton cycle (cooling of the working fluid) is omitted, as gas turbines are [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]] that do not use the same air again.\n\nGas turbines are used to power aircraft, trains, ships, electrical generators, pumps, gas compressors, and [[tank]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sonntag |first1=Richard E. |last2=Borgnakke |first2=Claus |title=Introduction to engineering thermodynamics |year=2006 |publisher=John Wiley |isbn=9780471737599 |edition= Second}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Timeline of development==\n[[File:John Barber's gas turbine.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Sketch of John Barber's gas turbine, from his patent]]\n\n*50: Earliest records of [[Hero of Alexandria|Hero's]] engine (''[[aeolipile]]'').

Together, these make up the [[Brayton cycle]].\n[[File:Brayton cycle.svg|thumb|[[Brayton cycle]]]]\nIn a real gas turbine, mechanical energy is changed irreversibly (due to internal friction and turbulence) into pressure and thermal energy when the gas is compressed (in either a centrifugal or axial [[Gas compressor|compressor]]). Heat is added in the [[combustor|combustion chamber]] and the [[specific volume]] of the gas increases, accompanied by a slight loss in pressure. During expansion through the stator and rotor passages in the turbine, irreversible energy transformation once again occurs. Fresh air is taken in, in place of the heat rejection.\n\nIf the engine has a power turbine added to drive an industrial generator or a helicopter rotor, the exit pressure will be as close to the entry pressure as possible with only enough energy left to overcome the pressure losses in the exhaust ducting and expel the exhaust. For a [[turboprop]] engine there will be a particular balance between propeller power and jet thrust which gives the most economical operation. In a [[turbojet engine]] only enough pressure and energy is extracted from the flow to drive the compressor and other components. The remaining high-pressure gases are accelerated through a nozzle to provide a jet to propel an aircraft.\n\nThe smaller the engine, the higher the rotation rate of the shaft(s) must be to attain the required blade tip speed. Blade-tip speed determines the maximum pressure ratios that can be obtained by the turbine and the compressor. This, in turn, limits the maximum power and efficiency that can be obtained by the engine. In order for tip speed to remain constant, if the diameter of a rotor is reduced by half, the [[rotational speed]] must double. For example, large jet engines operate around 10,000-25,000 rpm, while micro turbines spin as fast as 500,000 rpm.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.isma-isaac.be/publications/PMA_MOD_publications/ISMA2006/181-198.pdf |title=Rotordynamic behaviour of a micro-turbine rotor on air bearings: modelling techniques and experimental verification, p. 182 |first1=T. |last1=Waumans |first2=P. |last2=Vleugels |first3=J. |last3=Peirs |first4=F. |last4=Al-Bender |first5=D. |last5=Reynaerts |publisher=International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering |conference=ISMA |year=2006 |accessdate=7 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225144713/http://www.isma-isaac.be/publications/PMA_MOD_publications/ISMA2006/181-198.pdf |archive-date=2013-02-25 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMechanically, gas turbines ''can'' be considerably less complex than [[internal combustion]] piston engines. Simple turbines might have one main moving part, the compressor/shaft/turbine rotor assembly (see image above), with other moving parts in the fuel system. This, in turn, can translate into price. For instance, costing {{currency|10,000|RM}} for materials, the Jumo 004 proved cheaper than the [[Junkers Jumo 213|Junkers 213]] piston engine, which was {{currency|35,000|RM}},<ref>Christopher, John. ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes'' (The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013), p.74.</ref> and needed only 375 hours of lower-skill labor to complete (including manufacture, assembly, and shipping), compared to 1,400 for the [[BMW 801]].<ref>Christopher, p.75.</ref> <!--Christopher isn't clear if this only applied to the 004s, so confirmation is wanted here....-->This, however, also translated into poor efficiency and reliability. More advanced gas turbines (such as those found in modern [[turbofan|jet engines]] or combined cycle power plants) may have 2 or 3 shafts (spools), hundreds of compressor and turbine blades, movable stator blades, and extensive external tubing for fuel, oil and air systems; they use temperature resistant alloys, and are made with tight specifications requiring precision manufacture. All this often makes the construction of a simple gas turbine more complicated than a piston engine.\n\nMoreover, to reach optimum performance in modern gas turbine power plants the gas needs to be prepared to exact fuel specifications. Fuel gas conditioning systems treat the natural gas to reach the exact fuel specification prior to entering the turbine in terms of pressure, temperature, gas composition, and the related wobbe-index.\n\nThe primary advantage of a gas turbine engine is its power to weight ratio.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} \nSince significant useful work can be generated by a relatively lightweight engine, gas turbines are perfectly suited for aircraft propulsion.\n\n[[Thrust bearing]]s and [[plain bearing|journal bearings]] are a critical part of a design.

Higher operating temperatures are continuously sought in order to increase efficiency, but come at the cost of higher creep rates. Several methods have therefore been employed in an attempt to achieve optimal performance while limiting creep, with the most successful ones being high performance coatings and single crystal [[superalloy]]s.<ref>{{cite conference |first1=Brian |last1=Hazel |first2=Joe |last2=Rigney |first3=Mark |last3=Gorman |first4=Brett |last4=Boutwell |first5=Ram |last5=Darolia |title=Development of Improved Bond Coat for Enhanced Turbine Durability |doi=10.7449/2008/Superalloys_2008_753_760 |conference =Superalloys |publisher=The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society |location=US |year=2008|doi-access=free }}</ref> These technologies work by limiting deformation that occurs by mechanisms that can be broadly classified as dislocation glide, dislocation climb and diffusional flow.\n\nProtective coatings provide thermal insulation of the blade and offer [[oxidation]] and [[corrosion]] resistance. Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are often stabilized [[zirconium dioxide]]-based ceramics and oxidation/corrosion resistant coatings (bond coats) typically consist of aluminides or MCrAlY (where M is typically Fe and/or Cr) alloys. Using TBCs limits the temperature exposure of the superalloy substrate, thereby decreasing the diffusivity of the active species (typically vacancies) within the alloy and reducing dislocation and vacancy creep. It has been found that a coating of 1-200\u03bcm can decrease blade temperatures by up to 200\u00b0C.<ref> [https://www.phase-trans.msm.cam.ac.uk/2003/Superalloys/coatings/index.html \"Coatings for turbine blades\"] </ref> \nBond coats are directly applied onto the surface of the substrate using pack carburization and serve the dual purpose of providing improved adherence for the TBC and oxidation resistance for the substrate.

The finely dispersed \u03b3' precipitates impede dislocation motion and introduce a threshold stress, increasing the stress required for the onset of creep. Furthermore, \u03b3' is an ordered L1<sub>2</sub> phase that makes it harder for dislocations to shear past it.<ref> A.

Turboprop engines are used on small aircraft such as the general-aviation [[Cessna 208 Caravan]] and [[Embraer EMB 312 Tucano]] military trainer, medium-sized commuter aircraft such as the [[Bombardier Dash 8]] and large aircraft such as the [[Airbus A400M]] transport and the 60-year-old [[Tupolev Tu-95]] strategic bomber.\n\n===Aeroderivative gas turbines===\n[[File:GaTurbineBlade.svg|thumb|Diagram of a high-pressure [[Turbine blade#Film cooling|film-cooled turbine blade]]]]\n\nAeroderivatives are also used in electrical power generation due to their ability to be shut down and handle load changes more quickly than industrial machines. They are also used in the marine industry to reduce weight. The [[General Electric LM2500]], [[General Electric LM6000]], [[Rolls-Royce RB211]] and [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] are common models of this type of machine.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Amateur gas turbines===\nIncreasing numbers of gas turbines are being used or even constructed by amateurs.\n\nIn its most straightforward form, these are commercial turbines acquired through military surplus or scrapyard sales, then operated for display as part of the hobby of engine collecting.<ref name=\"latexiron\" >{{cite web|url= http://www.vb.n00bunlimited.net/vBTube.php?do=view&vidid=5iQRdBE3IS0 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130413204957/http://www.vb.n00bunlimited.net/vBTube.php?do=view&vidid=5iQRdBE3IS0 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 13 April 2013 |title=Vulcan APU startup |format=video}}</ref><ref name=\"Internal Fire, Proteus\">{{cite web|title=Bristol Siddeley Proteus |year=1999 |publisher=Internal Fire Museum of Power |url=http://www.internalfire.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=136 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118165708/http://www.internalfire.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=136 |archivedate=18 January 2009}}</ref> In its most extreme form, amateurs have even rebuilt engines beyond professional repair and then used them to compete for the [[Green Monster (car)|Land Speed Record]].\n\nThe simplest form of self-constructed gas turbine employs an automotive [[turbocharger]] as the core component.

They supply:\n* compressed air for air conditioning and ventilation,\n* compressed air start-up power for larger [[jet engine]]s,\n* mechanical (shaft) power to a gearbox to drive shafted accessories or to start large jet engines, and\n* electrical, hydraulic and other power-transmission sources to consuming devices remote from the APU.\n\n===Industrial gas turbines for power generation===\n[[File:GE H series Gas Turbine.jpg|thumb|GE H series power generation gas turbine: in [[combined cycle]] configuration, its highest [[Thermodynamic efficiency|thermal efficiency]] is 62.22%]]\n\nIndustrial gas turbines differ from aeronautical designs in that the frames, bearings, and blading are of heavier construction. They are also much more closely integrated with the devices they power\u2014 often an [[electric generator]]\u2014and the secondary-energy equipment that is used to recover residual energy (largely heat).\n\nThey range in size from portable mobile plants to large, complex systems weighing more than a hundred tonnes housed in purpose-built buildings. When the gas turbine is used solely for shaft power, its thermal efficiency is about 30%. However, it may be cheaper to buy electricity than to generate it. Therefore, many engines are used in CHP (Combined Heat and Power) configurations that can be small enough to be integrated into portable [[Intermodal container|container]] configurations.\n\nGas turbines can be particularly efficient when [[waste heat]] from the turbine is recovered by a heat recovery steam generator to power a conventional steam turbine in a [[combined cycle]] configuration.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://memagazineblog.org/2012/07/01/efficiency-by-the-numbers/ |title= Efficiency by the Numbers |author= Lee S.

They can also be run in a [[cogeneration]] configuration: the exhaust is used for space or water heating, or drives an [[gas-absorption refrigerator|absorption chiller]] for cooling the inlet air and increase the power output, technology known as [[Turbine Inlet Air Cooling]].\n\nAnother significant advantage is their ability to be turned on and off within minutes, supplying power during peak, or unscheduled, demand. Since single cycle (gas turbine only) power plants are less efficient than combined cycle plants, they are usually used as [[peaking power plant]]s, which operate anywhere from several hours per day to a few dozen hours per year\u2014depending on the electricity demand and the generating capacity of the region. In areas with a shortage of base-load and [[load following power plant]] capacity or with low fuel costs, a gas turbine powerplant may regularly operate most hours of the day. A large single-cycle gas turbine typically produces 100 to 400&nbsp;megawatts of electric power and has 35\u201340% [[thermodynamic efficiency|thermal efficiency]].<ref name=siemens>{{cite web | first1=Phil | last1=Ratliff |first2=Paul |last2=Garbett |first3=Willibald |last3=Fischer | title = The New Siemens Gas Turbine SGT5-8000H for More Customer Benefit | work =VGB PowerTech | publisher =Siemens Power Generation |date=September 2007| url =http://www.energy.siemens.com/us/pool/hq/power-generation/gas-turbines/downloads/SGT5-8000H_benefits.pdf |accessdate=17 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Industrial gas turbines for mechanical drive===\nIndustrial gas turbines that are used solely for mechanical drive or used in collaboration with a recovery steam generator differ from power generating sets in that they are often smaller and feature a dual shaft design as opposed to a single shaft. The power range varies from 1 megawatt up to 50 megawatts.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} These engines are connected directly or via a gearbox to either a pump or compressor assembly. The majority of installations are used within the oil and gas industries. Mechanical drive applications increase efficiency by around 2%.\n\nOil and gas platforms require these engines to drive compressors to inject gas into the wells to force oil up via another bore, or to compress the gas for transportation. They are also often used to provide power for the platform. These platforms do not need to use the engine in collaboration with a CHP system due to getting the gas at an extremely reduced cost (often free from burn off gas). The same companies use pump sets to drive the fluids to land and across pipelines in various intervals.\n\n====Compressed air energy storage====\n{{Main|Compressed air energy storage}}\n\nOne modern development seeks to improve efficiency in another way, by separating the compressor and the turbine with a compressed air store. In a conventional turbine, up to half the generated power is used driving the compressor. In a compressed air energy storage configuration, power, perhaps from a wind farm or bought on the open market at a time of low demand and low price, is used to drive the compressor, and the compressed air released to operate the turbine when required.\n\n===Turboshaft engines===\n[[Turboshaft]] engines are often used to drive compression trains (for example in gas pumping stations or natural gas liquefaction plants) and are used to power almost all modern helicopters. The primary shaft bears the compressor and the high-speed turbine (often referred to as the ''Gas Generator''), while a second shaft bears the low-speed turbine (a ''power turbine'' or ''free-wheeling turbine'' on helicopters, especially, because the gas generator turbine spins separately from the power turbine). In effect the separation of the gas generator, by a fluid coupling (the hot energy-rich combustion gases), from the power turbine is analogous to an [[Automatic transmission|automotive transmission's]] [[Torque converter|fluid coupling]]. This arrangement is used to increase power-output flexibility with associated highly-reliable control mechanisms.\n\n===Radial gas turbines===\n{{Main|Radial turbine}}\n\nIn 1963, [[Jan Mowill]] initiated the development at [[Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk]] in [[Norway]]. Various successors have made good progress in the refinement of this mechanism. Owing to a configuration that keeps heat away from certain bearings, the durability of the machine is improved while the radial turbine is well matched in speed requirement.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Scale jet engines===\n[[File:DH Goblin annotated colour cutaway.png|thumb|Scale jet engines are scaled down versions of this early full scale engine]]\n\nAlso known as miniature gas turbines or micro-jets.\n\nWith this in mind the pioneer of modern Micro-Jets, [[Kurt Schreckling]], produced one of the world's first Micro-Turbines, the FD3/67.<ref name=\"Schreckling, Gas Turbines for Model Aircraft\" /> This engine can produce up to 22 [[newton (unit)|newton]]s of thrust, and can be built by most mechanically minded people with basic engineering tools, such as a [[metal lathe]].<ref name=\"Schreckling, Gas Turbines for Model Aircraft\" />\n\n===Microturbines===\n{{main|Microturbine}}\n\nEvolved from piston engine [[turbocharger]]s, aircraft [[auxiliary power unit|APU]]s or small [[jet engine]]s, [[microturbine]]s are 25 to 500 [[kilowatt]] turbines the size of a [[refrigerator]].<!--<ref name=wbdg22dec2016/>-->\nMicroturbines have around 15% [[engine efficiency|efficiencies]] without a [[recuperator]], 20 to 30% with one and they can reach 85% combined thermal-electrical efficiency in [[cogeneration]].<ref name=wbdg22dec2016>{{cite news |url= https://www.wbdg.org/resources/microturbines |title= Microturbines |first=Barney L. |last=Capehart |date=22 December 2016 |publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences |work=Whole Building Design Guide}}</ref>\n\n==External combustion==\nMost gas turbines are internal combustion engines but it is also possible to manufacture an external combustion gas turbine which is, effectively, a turbine version of a [[hot air engine]].\nThose systems are usually indicated as EFGT (Externally Fired Gas Turbine) or IFGT (Indirectly Fired Gas Turbine).\n\nExternal combustion has been used for the purpose of using [[pulverized coal]] or finely ground biomass (such as sawdust) as a fuel. In the indirect system, a [[Shell and tube heat exchanger|heat exchanger]] is used and only clean air with no combustion products travels through the power turbine. The [[thermal efficiency]] is lower in the indirect type of external combustion; however, the turbine blades are not subjected to combustion products and much lower quality (and therefore cheaper) fuels are able to be used.\n\nWhen external combustion is used, it is possible to use exhaust air from the turbine as the primary combustion air. This effectively reduces global heat losses, although heat losses associated with the combustion exhaust remain inevitable.\n\n[[Closed-cycle gas turbine]]s based on [[helium]] or [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] also hold promise for use with future high temperature solar and nuclear power generation.\n\n==In surface vehicles==\n[[File:MZKT open day 2019 p06.jpg|right|thumb|[[MAZ-7907]], a [[Transporter erector launcher]] with a [[Turbine-electric transmission]]]]\n\nGas turbines are often used on [[ship]]s, [[locomotive]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[tank]]s, and to a lesser extent, on cars, buses, and motorcycles.\n\nA key advantage of jets and [[turboprop]]s for airplane propulsion - their superior performance at high altitude compared to piston engines, particularly [[naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] ones - is irrelevant in most automobile applications. Their power-to-weight advantage, though less critical than for aircraft, is still important.\n\nGas turbines offer a high-powered engine in a very small and light package. However, they are not as responsive and efficient as small piston engines over the wide range of RPMs and powers needed in vehicle applications. In [[Series hybrid|series hybrid vehicles]], as the driving electric motors are mechanically detached from the electricity generating engine, the responsiveness, poor performance at low speed and low efficiency at low output problems are much less important. The turbine can be run at optimum speed for its power output, and batteries and [[Electric double-layer capacitor|ultracapacitors]] can supply power as needed, with the engine cycled on and off to run it only at high efficiency. The emergence of the [[continuously variable transmission]] may also alleviate the responsiveness problem.\n\nTurbines have historically been more expensive to produce than piston engines, though this is partly because piston engines have been mass-produced in huge quantities for decades, while small gas turbine engines are rarities; however, turbines are mass-produced in the closely related form of the [[turbocharger]].\n\nThe turbocharger is basically a compact and simple free shaft radial gas turbine which is driven by the piston engine's [[exhaust gas]]. The centripetal turbine wheel drives a [[centrifugal compressor]] wheel through a common rotating shaft. This wheel supercharges the engine air intake to a degree that can be controlled by means of a [[wastegate]] or by dynamically modifying the turbine housing's geometry (as in a [[Variable geometry turbocharger|VGT]] turbocharger).\nIt mainly serves as a power recovery device which converts a great deal of otherwise wasted thermal and kinetic energy into engine [[Turbo|boost]].\n\n[[Turbo-compound engine]]s (actually employed on some [[Semi-trailer truck|truck]]s) are fitted with blow down turbines which are similar in design and appearance to a turbocharger\nexcept for the turbine shaft being mechanically or hydraulically connected to the engine's crankshaft instead of to a centrifugal compressor, thus providing additional power instead of boost.\nWhile the turbocharger is a pressure turbine, a power recovery turbine is a velocity one.\n\n===Passenger road vehicles (cars, bikes, and buses)===\nA number of experiments have been conducted with gas turbine powered [[automobile]]s, the largest by [[Chrysler]].<ref>[http://www.turbinecar.com/misc/History.pdf \"History of Chrysler Corporation Gas Turbine Vehicles\"] published by the Engineering Section 1979</ref><ref>[http://automobileart.homestead.com/ChryslerConceptCars.html \"Chrysler Corp., Exner Concept Cars 1940 to 1961\" undated], retrieved on 11 May 2008.</ref> More recently, there has been some interest in the use of turbine engines for hybrid electric cars.

The objective of the consortium, which includes luxury car maker Jaguar Land Rover and leading electrical machine company SR Drives, is to produce the world's first commercially viable - and environmentally friendly - gas turbine generator designed specifically for automotive applications.<ref name=\"bladon\">[http://www.bladonjets.com/news/bladon-jets-wins-tsb-award/ Bladon Jets And Jaguar Land Rover Win Funding For Gas Turbine Electric Vehicle Project] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120313215440/http://www.bladonjets.com/news/bladon-jets-wins-tsb-award/ |date=13 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe common turbocharger for gasoline or diesel engines is also a turbine derivative.\n\n====Concept cars====\n[[File:Rover.jet1.jpg|thumb|The 1950 [[Rover Company|Rover]] JET1]]\n\nThe first serious investigation of using a gas turbine in cars was in 1946 when two engineers, Robert Kafka and Robert Engerstein of Carney Associates, a New York engineering firm, came up with the concept where a unique compact turbine engine design would provide power for a rear wheel drive car.

Since then, gas turbine engines have been used as [[auxiliary power unit|APUs]] in some tanks and as main powerplants in Soviet/Russian [[T-80]]s and U.S. [[M1 Abrams]] tanks, among others. They are lighter and smaller than [[diesel engine|diesels]] at the same sustained power output but the models installed to date are less fuel efficient than the equivalent diesel, especially at idle, requiring more fuel to achieve the same combat range. Successive models of M1 have addressed this problem with battery packs or secondary generators to power the tank's systems while stationary, saving fuel by reducing the need to idle the main turbine. T-80s can mount three large external fuel drums to extend their range. Russia has stopped production of the T-80 in favor of the diesel-powered [[T-90]] (based on the [[T-72]]), while Ukraine has developed the diesel-powered T-80UD and T-84 with nearly the power of the gas-turbine tank. The French [[Leclerc tank|Leclerc]] MBT's diesel powerplant features the \"Hyperbar\" hybrid supercharging system, where the engine's turbocharger is completely replaced with a small gas turbine which also works as an assisted diesel exhaust turbocharger, enabling engine RPM-independent boost level control and a higher peak boost pressure to be reached (than with ordinary turbochargers). This system allows a smaller displacement and lighter engine to be used as the tank's powerplant and effectively removes [[turbo lag]]. This special gas turbine/turbocharger can also work independently from the main engine as an ordinary APU.\n\nA turbine is theoretically more reliable and easier to maintain than a piston engine since it has a simpler construction with fewer moving parts, but in practice, turbine parts experience a higher wear rate due to their higher working speeds. The turbine blades are highly sensitive to dust and fine sand so that in desert operations air filters have to be fitted and changed several times daily. An improperly fitted filter, or a bullet or shell fragment that punctures the filter, can damage the engine. Piston engines (especially if turbocharged) also need well-maintained filters, but they are more resilient if the filter does fail.\n\nLike most modern diesel engines used in tanks, gas turbines are usually multi-fuel engines.\n\n===Marine applications===\n{{main|Marine propulsion}}\n\n====Naval====\n[[File:Gas turbine from MGB 2009.jpg|thumb|The Gas turbine from MGB 2009]]\n\nGas turbines are used in many [[naval vessel]]s, where they are valued for their high [[power-to-weight ratio]] and their ships' resulting acceleration and ability to get underway quickly.\n\nThe first gas-turbine-powered naval vessel was the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Motor Gun Boat]] ''MGB 2009'' (formerly ''MGB 509'') converted in 1947.

While interest in the gas turbine for marine purposes, both naval and mercantile, continued to increase, the lack of availability of the results of operating experience on early gas turbine projects limited the number of new ventures on seagoing commercial vessels being embarked upon. In 1951, the Diesel-electric oil tanker ''Auris'', 12,290 [[Deadweight tonnage]] (DWT) was used to obtain operating experience with a main propulsion gas turbine under service conditions at sea and so became the first ocean-going merchant ship to be powered by a gas turbine.

Following successful sea trials off the Northumbrian coast, the ''Auris'' set sail from Hebburn-on-Tyne in October 1951 bound for [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] in the US and then [[Curacao]] in the southern Caribbean returning to [[Avonmouth]] after 44 days at sea, successfully completing her historic trans-Atlantic crossing. During this time at sea the gas turbine burnt diesel fuel and operated without an involuntary stop or mechanical difficulty of any kind. She subsequently visited Swansea, Hull, [[Rotterdam]], [[Oslo]] and Southampton covering a total of 13,211 nautical miles. The ''Auris'' then had all of its power plants replaced with a {{convert|5250|shp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} directly coupled gas turbine to become the first civilian ship to operate solely on gas turbine power.\n\nDespite the success of this early experimental voyage the gas turbine did not replace the diesel engine as the propulsion plant for large merchant ships. At constant cruising speeds the diesel engine simply had no peer in the vital area of fuel economy. The gas turbine did have more success in Royal Navy ships and the other naval fleets of the world where sudden and rapid changes of speed are required by warships in action.<ref>{{cite book|title=Future Ship Powering Options: Exploring alternative methods of ship propulsion|publisher=Royal Academy of Engineering Prince Philip House|isbn=9781909327016|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/reports/future-ship-powering-options|year=2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Maritime Commission]] were looking for options to update WWII [[Liberty ships]], and heavy-duty gas turbines were one of those selected. In 1956 the ''John Sergeant'' was lengthened and equipped with a [[General Electric]] {{convert|6600|shp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} HD gas turbine with exhaust-gas regeneration, reduction gearing and a [[variable-pitch propeller]]. It operated for 9,700 hours using residual fuel([[Bunker C]]) for 7,000 hours. Fuel efficiency was on a par with steam propulsion at {{convert|0.523|lb/hp|abbr=on|order=flip}} per hour,<ref name=\"IMGT\">Naval Education and Training Program Development Center ''Introduction to Marine Gas Turbines'' (1978) Naval Education and Training Support Command, pp. 3.</ref> and power output was higher than expected at {{convert|7514|shp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} due to the ambient temperature of the North Sea route being lower than the design temperature of the gas turbine. This gave the ship a speed capability of 18 knots, up from 11 knots with the original power plant, and well in excess of the 15 knot targeted. The ship made its first transatlantic crossing with an average speed of 16.8 knots, in spite of some rough weather along the way. Suitable Bunker C fuel was only available at limited ports because the quality of the fuel was of a critical nature. The fuel oil also had to be treated on board to reduce contaminants and this was a labor-intensive process that was not suitable for automation at the time. Ultimately, the variable-pitch propeller, which was of a new and untested design, ended the trial, as three consecutive annual inspections revealed stress-cracking. This did not reflect poorly on the marine-propulsion gas-turbine concept though, and the trial was a success overall. The success of this trial opened the way for more development by GE on the use of HD gas turbines for marine use with heavy fuels.<ref name=\"Innovation\">National Research Council (U.S.) ''Innovation in the Maritime Industry'' (1979) Maritime Transportation Research Board, pp. 127-131</ref> The ''John Sergeant'' was scrapped in 1972 at Portsmouth PA.\n\n[[File:20091105-TurboJET Urzela.jpg|thumb|Boeing Jetfoil 929-100-007 ''Urzela'' of [[TurboJET]]]]\n[[Boeing]] launched its first passenger-carrying [[Pump-jet|waterjet]]-propelled [[hydrofoil]] [[Boeing 929]], in April 1974.

Those ships were powered by twin [[Pratt & Whitney]] gas turbines of the FT 4 series. The four ships in the class were named ''Euroliner'', ''Eurofreighter'', ''Asialiner'' and ''Asiafreighter''. Following the dramatic [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC) price increases of the mid-1970s, operations were constrained by rising fuel costs. Some modification of the engine systems on those ships was undertaken to permit the burning of a lower grade of fuel (i.e., [[Marine diesel oil|marine diesel]]). Reduction of fuel costs was successful using a different untested fuel in a marine gas turbine but maintenance costs increased with the fuel change. After 1981 the ships were sold and refitted with, what at the time, was more economical diesel-fueled engines but the increased engine size reduced cargo space.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe first passenger ferry to use a gas turbine was the [[GTS Finnjet|GTS ''Finnjet'']], built in 1977 and powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney]] FT 4C-1 DLF turbines, generating {{convert|55000|kW|shp|abbr=on}} and propelling the ship to a speed of 31&nbsp;knots. However, the Finnjet also illustrated the shortcomings of gas turbine propulsion in commercial craft, as high fuel prices made operating her unprofitable. After four years of service, additional diesel engines were installed on the ship to reduce running costs during the off-season. The Finnjet was also the first ship with a [[Combined diesel-electric and gas]] propulsion. Another example of commercial use of gas turbines in a passenger ship is [[Stena Line]]'s [[High-speed Sea Service|HSS class]] fastcraft ferries.

The application of microelectronics and [[power switching]] technology have enabled the development of commercially viable electricity generation by microturbines for distribution and vehicle propulsion.\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\nThe following are advantages and disadvantages of gas-turbine engines:<ref>{{cite web|last=Brain |first=Marshall |url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/turbine2.htm |title=How Gas Turbine Engines Work |publisher=Science.howstuffworks.com |date=1 April 2000 |accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Advantages===\n* Very high [[power-to-weight ratio]] compared to reciprocating engines.\n* Smaller than most reciprocating engines of the same power rating.\n* Smooth rotation of the main shaft produces far less vibration than a reciprocating engine.\n* Fewer moving parts than reciprocating engines results in lower maintenance cost and higher reliability/availability over its service life.\n* Greater reliability, particularly in applications where sustained high power output is required.\n* Waste heat is dissipated almost entirely in the exhaust. This results in a high-temperature exhaust stream that is very usable for boiling water in a [[combined cycle]], or for [[cogeneration]].\n* Lower peak combustion pressures than reciprocating engines in general.\n* High shaft speeds in smaller \"free turbine units\", although larger gas turbines employed in power generation operate at synchronous speeds.\n* Low lubricating oil cost and consumption.\n* Can run on a wide variety of fuels.\n* Very low toxic emissions of CO and HC due to excess air, complete combustion and no \"quench\" of the flame on cold surfaces.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n* Core engine costs can be high due to use of exotic materials.\n* Less efficient than reciprocating engines at idle speed.\n* Longer startup than reciprocating engines.\n* Less responsive to changes in power demand compared with reciprocating engines.\n* Characteristic whine can be hard to suppress.\n\n==Testing==\nBritish, German, other national and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test gas turbines. Selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance to the design of the turbine and associated systems. In the United States, [[ASME]] has produced several performance test codes on gas turbines. This includes ASME PTC 22-2014. These ASME performance test codes have gained international recognition and acceptance for testing gas turbines. The single most important and differentiating characteristic of ASME performance test codes, including PTC 22, is that the test uncertainty of the measurement indicates the quality of the test and is not to be used as a commercial tolerance.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Air-start system]]\n*[[Axial compressor]]\n*[[Centrifugal compressor]]\n*[[Distributed generation]]\n*[[Gas turbine-electric locomotive]]\n*[[Gas turbine locomotive]]\n*[[Gas turbine modular helium reactor]]\n*[[Non-intrusive stress measurement system|Non-intrusive stress measurement]]\n*[[Pneumatic motor]]\n*[[Steam turbine]]\n*[[Turbine engine failure]]\n*[[Wind turbine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110317172825/http://articles.compressionjobs.com/articles/oilfield-101/168-gas-turbines-principles-lube-control-systems-overspeed Stationary Combustion Gas Turbines including Oil & Over-Speed Control System description]\n*\"Aircraft Gas Turbine Technology\" by Irwin E.

The main elements common to all gas turbine engines are:\n* an upstream rotating [[gas compressor]]\n* a [[combustor]]\n* a downstream [[turbine]] on the same shaft as the compressor.\n\nA fourth component is often used to increase efficiency (on [[turboprop]]s and [[turbofan]]s), to convert power into mechanical or electric form (on [[turboshaft]]s and [[electric generator]]s), or to achieve greater [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] (on [[afterburner|afterburning]] engines).\n\nThe basic operation of the gas turbine is a [[Brayton cycle]] with air as the [[working fluid]]. Atmospheric air flows through the compressor that brings it to higher pressure. [[Energy]] is then added by spraying fuel into the air and igniting it so the combustion generates a high-temperature flow. This high-temperature high-pressure gas enters a turbine, where it expands down to the exhaust pressure, producing a shaft work output in the process. The turbine shaft work is used to drive the compressor; the energy that is not used for compressing the working fluid comes out in the [[exhaust gases]] that can be used to do external work, such as directly producing [[thrust]] in a turbojet engine, or rotating a second, independent turbine (known as a power turbine) which can be connected to a fan, propeller, or electrical generator.  The purpose of the gas turbine determines the design so that the most desirable split of energy between the thrust and the shaft work is achieved. The fourth step of the Brayton cycle (cooling of the working fluid) is omitted, as gas turbines are [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]] that do not use the same air again.\n\nGas turbines are used to power aircraft, trains, ships, electrical generators, pumps, gas compressors, and [[tank]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sonntag |first1=Richard E. |last2=Borgnakke |first2=Claus |title=Introduction to engineering thermodynamics |year=2006 |publisher=John Wiley |isbn=9780471737599 |edition= Second}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Timeline of development==\n[[File:John Barber's gas turbine.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Sketch of John Barber's gas turbine, from his patent]]\n\n*50: Earliest records of [[Hero of Alexandria|Hero's]] engine (''[[aeolipile]]'').

Together, these make up the [[Brayton cycle]].\n[[File:Brayton cycle.svg|thumb|[[Brayton cycle]]]]\nIn a real gas turbine, mechanical energy is changed irreversibly (due to internal friction and turbulence) into pressure and thermal energy when the gas is compressed (in either a centrifugal or axial [[Gas compressor|compressor]]). Heat is added in the [[combustor|combustion chamber]] and the [[specific volume]] of the gas increases, accompanied by a slight loss in pressure. During expansion through the stator and rotor passages in the turbine, irreversible energy transformation once again occurs. Fresh air is taken in, in place of the heat rejection.\n\nIf the engine has a power turbine added to drive an industrial generator or a helicopter rotor, the exit pressure will be as close to the entry pressure as possible with only enough energy left to overcome the pressure losses in the exhaust ducting and expel the exhaust. For a [[turboprop]] engine there will be a particular balance between propeller power and jet thrust which gives the most economical operation. In a [[turbojet engine]] only enough pressure and energy is extracted from the flow to drive the compressor and other components. The remaining high-pressure gases are accelerated through a nozzle to provide a jet to propel an aircraft.\n\nThe smaller the engine, the higher the rotation rate of the shaft(s) must be to attain the required blade tip speed. Blade-tip speed determines the maximum pressure ratios that can be obtained by the turbine and the compressor. This, in turn, limits the maximum power and efficiency that can be obtained by the engine. In order for tip speed to remain constant, if the diameter of a rotor is reduced by half, the [[rotational speed]] must double. For example, large jet engines operate around 10,000-25,000 rpm, while micro turbines spin as fast as 500,000 rpm.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.isma-isaac.be/publications/PMA_MOD_publications/ISMA2006/181-198.pdf |title=Rotordynamic behaviour of a micro-turbine rotor on air bearings: modelling techniques and experimental verification, p. 182 |first1=T. |last1=Waumans |first2=P. |last2=Vleugels |first3=J. |last3=Peirs |first4=F. |last4=Al-Bender |first5=D. |last5=Reynaerts |publisher=International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering |conference=ISMA |year=2006 |accessdate=7 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225144713/http://www.isma-isaac.be/publications/PMA_MOD_publications/ISMA2006/181-198.pdf |archive-date=2013-02-25 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMechanically, gas turbines ''can'' be considerably less complex than [[internal combustion]] piston engines. Simple turbines might have one main moving part, the compressor/shaft/turbine rotor assembly (see image above), with other moving parts in the fuel system. This, in turn, can translate into price. For instance, costing {{currency|10,000|RM}} for materials, the Jumo 004 proved cheaper than the [[Junkers Jumo 213|Junkers 213]] piston engine, which was {{currency|35,000|RM}},<ref>Christopher, John.

More advanced gas turbines (such as those found in modern [[turbofan|jet engines]] or combined cycle power plants) may have 2 or 3 shafts (spools), hundreds of compressor and turbine blades, movable stator blades, and extensive external tubing for fuel, oil and air systems; they use temperature resistant alloys, and are made with tight specifications requiring precision manufacture. All this often makes the construction of a simple gas turbine more complicated than a piston engine.\n\nMoreover, to reach optimum performance in modern gas turbine power plants the gas needs to be prepared to exact fuel specifications. Fuel gas conditioning systems treat the natural gas to reach the exact fuel specification prior to entering the turbine in terms of pressure, temperature, gas composition, and the related wobbe-index.\n\nThe primary advantage of a gas turbine engine is its power to weight ratio.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} \nSince significant useful work can be generated by a relatively lightweight engine, gas turbines are perfectly suited for aircraft propulsion.\n\n[[Thrust bearing]]s and [[plain bearing|journal bearings]] are a critical part of a design. They are [[Fluid bearing|hydrodynamic oil bearings]] or oil-cooled [[rolling-element bearing]]s. [[Foil bearing]]s are used in some small machines such as micro turbines<ref>http://www.uwm.edu.pl/wnt/technicalsc/tech_12/B19.pdf</ref> and also have strong potential for use in small gas turbines/[[auxiliary power unit]]s<ref>{{cite book |last=Agrawal |first=Giri L. |title=Foil Air/Gas Bearing Technology \u2013 An Overview |journal=ASME 1997 International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition |pages=V001T04A006 |date=2 June 1997 |doi=10.1115/97-GT-347 |url= http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2088143 |accessdate=23 July 2018|isbn=978-0-7918-7868-2 }}</ref>\n\n=== Creep ===\nA major challenge facing turbine design, especially [[turbine blades]], is reducing the [[creep (deformation)|creep]] that is induced by the high temperatures and stresses that are experienced during operation. Higher operating temperatures are continuously sought in order to increase efficiency, but come at the cost of higher creep rates. Several methods have therefore been employed in an attempt to achieve optimal performance while limiting creep, with the most successful ones being high performance coatings and single crystal [[superalloy]]s.<ref>{{cite conference |first1=Brian |last1=Hazel |first2=Joe |last2=Rigney |first3=Mark |last3=Gorman |first4=Brett |last4=Boutwell |first5=Ram |last5=Darolia |title=Development of Improved Bond Coat for Enhanced Turbine Durability |doi=10.7449/2008/Superalloys_2008_753_760 |conference =Superalloys |publisher=The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society |location=US |year=2008|doi-access=free }}</ref> These technologies work by limiting deformation that occurs by mechanisms that can be broadly classified as dislocation glide, dislocation climb and diffusional flow.\n\nProtective coatings provide thermal insulation of the blade and offer [[oxidation]] and [[corrosion]] resistance. Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are often stabilized [[zirconium dioxide]]-based ceramics and oxidation/corrosion resistant coatings (bond coats) typically consist of aluminides or MCrAlY (where M is typically Fe and/or Cr) alloys. Using TBCs limits the temperature exposure of the superalloy substrate, thereby decreasing the diffusivity of the active species (typically vacancies) within the alloy and reducing dislocation and vacancy creep. It has been found that a coating of 1-200\u03bcm can decrease blade temperatures by up to 200\u00b0C.<ref> [https://www.phase-trans.msm.cam.ac.uk/2003/Superalloys/coatings/index.html \"Coatings for turbine blades\"] </ref> \nBond coats are directly applied onto the surface of the substrate using pack carburization and serve the dual purpose of providing improved adherence for the TBC and oxidation resistance for the substrate. The Al from the bond coats forms Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> on the TBC-bond coat interface which provides the oxidation resistance, but also results in the formation of an undesirable interdiffusion (ID) zone between itself and the substrate. <ref> A. W. James et al. \"Gas turbines: operating conditions, components and material requirements\"</ref> The oxidation resistance outweighs the drawbacks associated with the ID zone as it increases the lifetime of the blade and limits the efficiency losses caused by a buildup on the outside of the blades.<ref>Tamarin, Y. Protective Coatings for Turbine Blades. 2002. ASM International. pp 3-5</ref>\n\nNickel-based superalloys boast improved strength and creep resistance due to their composition and resultant [[microstructure]]. The gamma (\u03b3) FCC nickel is alloyed with aluminum and titanium in order to precipitate a uniform dispersion of the coherent Ni<sub>3</sub>(Al,Ti) gamma-prime (\u03b3') phases. The finely dispersed \u03b3' precipitates impede dislocation motion and introduce a threshold stress, increasing the stress required for the onset of creep. Furthermore, \u03b3' is an ordered L1<sub>2</sub> phase that makes it harder for dislocations to shear past it.<ref> A. Nowotnik \"Nickel-Based Superalloys\" </ref> Further [[Refractory]] elements such as [[rhenium]] and [[ruthenium]] can be added in solid solution to improve creep strength. The addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase, thus preserving the [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] resistance, strength, and creep resistance.<ref>Latief, F. H.; Kakehi, K. (2013) \"Effects of Re content and crystallographic orientation on creep behavior of aluminized Ni-based single crystal superalloys\". Materials & Design 49 : 485-492</ref> The development of single crystal superalloys has led to significant improvements in creep resistance as well. Due to the lack of grain boundaries, single crystals eliminate [[Coble creep]] and consequently deform by fewer modes - decreasing the creep rate. <ref> Caron P., Khan T. \"Evolution of Ni-based superalloys for single crystal gas turbine blade applications\" </ref>Although single crystals have lower creep at high temperatures, they have significantly lower yield stresses at room temperature where strength is determined by the Hall-Petch relationship. Care needs to be taken in order to optimize the design parameters to limit high temperature creep while not decreasing low temperature yield strength.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Jet engines===\n[[File:J85 ge 17a turbojet engine.jpg|thumb|typical axial-flow gas turbine turbojet, the [[General Electric J85|J85]], sectioned for display.

Turboprop engines are used on small aircraft such as the general-aviation [[Cessna 208 Caravan]] and [[Embraer EMB 312 Tucano]] military trainer, medium-sized commuter aircraft such as the [[Bombardier Dash 8]] and large aircraft such as the [[Airbus A400M]] transport and the 60-year-old [[Tupolev Tu-95]] strategic bomber.\n\n===Aeroderivative gas turbines===\n[[File:GaTurbineBlade.svg|thumb|Diagram of a high-pressure [[Turbine blade#Film cooling|film-cooled turbine blade]]]]\n\nAeroderivatives are also used in electrical power generation due to their ability to be shut down and handle load changes more quickly than industrial machines. They are also used in the marine industry to reduce weight. The [[General Electric LM2500]], [[General Electric LM6000]], [[Rolls-Royce RB211]] and [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] are common models of this type of machine.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Amateur gas turbines===\nIncreasing numbers of gas turbines are being used or even constructed by amateurs.\n\nIn its most straightforward form, these are commercial turbines acquired through military surplus or scrapyard sales, then operated for display as part of the hobby of engine collecting.<ref name=\"latexiron\" >{{cite web|url= http://www.vb.n00bunlimited.net/vBTube.php?do=view&vidid=5iQRdBE3IS0 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130413204957/http://www.vb.n00bunlimited.net/vBTube.php?do=view&vidid=5iQRdBE3IS0 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 13 April 2013 |title=Vulcan APU startup |format=video}}</ref><ref name=\"Internal Fire, Proteus\">{{cite web|title=Bristol Siddeley Proteus |year=1999 |publisher=Internal Fire Museum of Power |url=http://www.internalfire.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=136 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118165708/http://www.internalfire.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=136 |archivedate=18 January 2009}}</ref> In its most extreme form, amateurs have even rebuilt engines beyond professional repair and then used them to compete for the [[Green Monster (car)|Land Speed Record]].\n\nThe simplest form of self-constructed gas turbine employs an automotive [[turbocharger]] as the core component.

They supply:\n* compressed air for air conditioning and ventilation,\n* compressed air start-up power for larger [[jet engine]]s,\n* mechanical (shaft) power to a gearbox to drive shafted accessories or to start large jet engines, and\n* electrical, hydraulic and other power-transmission sources to consuming devices remote from the APU.\n\n===Industrial gas turbines for power generation===\n[[File:GE H series Gas Turbine.jpg|thumb|GE H series power generation gas turbine: in [[combined cycle]] configuration, its highest [[Thermodynamic efficiency|thermal efficiency]] is 62.22%]]\n\nIndustrial gas turbines differ from aeronautical designs in that the frames, bearings, and blading are of heavier construction. They are also much more closely integrated with the devices they power\u2014 often an [[electric generator]]\u2014and the secondary-energy equipment that is used to recover residual energy (largely heat).\n\nThey range in size from portable mobile plants to large, complex systems weighing more than a hundred tonnes housed in purpose-built buildings. When the gas turbine is used solely for shaft power, its thermal efficiency is about 30%. However, it may be cheaper to buy electricity than to generate it. Therefore, many engines are used in CHP (Combined Heat and Power) configurations that can be small enough to be integrated into portable [[Intermodal container|container]] configurations.\n\nGas turbines can be particularly efficient when [[waste heat]] from the turbine is recovered by a heat recovery steam generator to power a conventional steam turbine in a [[combined cycle]] configuration.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://memagazineblog.org/2012/07/01/efficiency-by-the-numbers/ |title= Efficiency by the Numbers |author= Lee S.

They can also be run in a [[cogeneration]] configuration: the exhaust is used for space or water heating, or drives an [[gas-absorption refrigerator|absorption chiller]] for cooling the inlet air and increase the power output, technology known as [[Turbine Inlet Air Cooling]].\n\nAnother significant advantage is their ability to be turned on and off within minutes, supplying power during peak, or unscheduled, demand. Since single cycle (gas turbine only) power plants are less efficient than combined cycle plants, they are usually used as [[peaking power plant]]s, which operate anywhere from several hours per day to a few dozen hours per year\u2014depending on the electricity demand and the generating capacity of the region. In areas with a shortage of base-load and [[load following power plant]] capacity or with low fuel costs, a gas turbine powerplant may regularly operate most hours of the day. A large single-cycle gas turbine typically produces 100 to 400&nbsp;megawatts of electric power and has 35\u201340% [[thermodynamic efficiency|thermal efficiency]].<ref name=siemens>{{cite web | first1=Phil | last1=Ratliff |first2=Paul |last2=Garbett |first3=Willibald |last3=Fischer | title = The New Siemens Gas Turbine SGT5-8000H for More Customer Benefit | work =VGB PowerTech | publisher =Siemens Power Generation |date=September 2007| url =http://www.energy.siemens.com/us/pool/hq/power-generation/gas-turbines/downloads/SGT5-8000H_benefits.pdf |accessdate=17 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Industrial gas turbines for mechanical drive===\nIndustrial gas turbines that are used solely for mechanical drive or used in collaboration with a recovery steam generator differ from power generating sets in that they are often smaller and feature a dual shaft design as opposed to a single shaft. The power range varies from 1 megawatt up to 50 megawatts.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} These engines are connected directly or via a gearbox to either a pump or compressor assembly. The majority of installations are used within the oil and gas industries. Mechanical drive applications increase efficiency by around 2%.\n\nOil and gas platforms require these engines to drive compressors to inject gas into the wells to force oil up via another bore, or to compress the gas for transportation. They are also often used to provide power for the platform. These platforms do not need to use the engine in collaboration with a CHP system due to getting the gas at an extremely reduced cost (often free from burn off gas). The same companies use pump sets to drive the fluids to land and across pipelines in various intervals.\n\n====Compressed air energy storage====\n{{Main|Compressed air energy storage}}\n\nOne modern development seeks to improve efficiency in another way, by separating the compressor and the turbine with a compressed air store. In a conventional turbine, up to half the generated power is used driving the compressor. In a compressed air energy storage configuration, power, perhaps from a wind farm or bought on the open market at a time of low demand and low price, is used to drive the compressor, and the compressed air released to operate the turbine when required.\n\n===Turboshaft engines===\n[[Turboshaft]] engines are often used to drive compression trains (for example in gas pumping stations or natural gas liquefaction plants) and are used to power almost all modern helicopters. The primary shaft bears the compressor and the high-speed turbine (often referred to as the ''Gas Generator''), while a second shaft bears the low-speed turbine (a ''power turbine'' or ''free-wheeling turbine'' on helicopters, especially, because the gas generator turbine spins separately from the power turbine). In effect the separation of the gas generator, by a fluid coupling (the hot energy-rich combustion gases), from the power turbine is analogous to an [[Automatic transmission|automotive transmission's]] [[Torque converter|fluid coupling]]. This arrangement is used to increase power-output flexibility with associated highly-reliable control mechanisms.\n\n===Radial gas turbines===\n{{Main|Radial turbine}}\n\nIn 1963, [[Jan Mowill]] initiated the development at [[Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk]] in [[Norway]]. Various successors have made good progress in the refinement of this mechanism. Owing to a configuration that keeps heat away from certain bearings, the durability of the machine is improved while the radial turbine is well matched in speed requirement.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Scale jet engines===\n[[File:DH Goblin annotated colour cutaway.png|thumb|Scale jet engines are scaled down versions of this early full scale engine]]\n\nAlso known as miniature gas turbines or micro-jets.\n\nWith this in mind the pioneer of modern Micro-Jets, [[Kurt Schreckling]], produced one of the world's first Micro-Turbines, the FD3/67.<ref name=\"Schreckling, Gas Turbines for Model Aircraft\" /> This engine can produce up to 22 [[newton (unit)|newton]]s of thrust, and can be built by most mechanically minded people with basic engineering tools, such as a [[metal lathe]].<ref name=\"Schreckling, Gas Turbines for Model Aircraft\" />\n\n===Microturbines===\n{{main|Microturbine}}\n\nEvolved from piston engine [[turbocharger]]s, aircraft [[auxiliary power unit|APU]]s or small [[jet engine]]s, [[microturbine]]s are 25 to 500 [[kilowatt]] turbines the size of a [[refrigerator]].<!--<ref name=wbdg22dec2016/>-->\nMicroturbines have around 15% [[engine efficiency|efficiencies]] without a [[recuperator]], 20 to 30% with one and they can reach 85% combined thermal-electrical efficiency in [[cogeneration]].<ref name=wbdg22dec2016>{{cite news |url= https://www.wbdg.org/resources/microturbines |title= Microturbines |first=Barney L. |last=Capehart |date=22 December 2016 |publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences |work=Whole Building Design Guide}}</ref>\n\n==External combustion==\nMost gas turbines are internal combustion engines but it is also possible to manufacture an external combustion gas turbine which is, effectively, a turbine version of a [[hot air engine]].\nThose systems are usually indicated as EFGT (Externally Fired Gas Turbine) or IFGT (Indirectly Fired Gas Turbine).\n\nExternal combustion has been used for the purpose of using [[pulverized coal]] or finely ground biomass (such as sawdust) as a fuel. In the indirect system, a [[Shell and tube heat exchanger|heat exchanger]] is used and only clean air with no combustion products travels through the power turbine. The [[thermal efficiency]] is lower in the indirect type of external combustion; however, the turbine blades are not subjected to combustion products and much lower quality (and therefore cheaper) fuels are able to be used.\n\nWhen external combustion is used, it is possible to use exhaust air from the turbine as the primary combustion air. This effectively reduces global heat losses, although heat losses associated with the combustion exhaust remain inevitable.\n\n[[Closed-cycle gas turbine]]s based on [[helium]] or [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] also hold promise for use with future high temperature solar and nuclear power generation.\n\n==In surface vehicles==\n[[File:MZKT open day 2019 p06.jpg|right|thumb|[[MAZ-7907]], a [[Transporter erector launcher]] with a [[Turbine-electric transmission]]]]\n\nGas turbines are often used on [[ship]]s, [[locomotive]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[tank]]s, and to a lesser extent, on cars, buses, and motorcycles.\n\nA key advantage of jets and [[turboprop]]s for airplane propulsion - their superior performance at high altitude compared to piston engines, particularly [[naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] ones - is irrelevant in most automobile applications. Their power-to-weight advantage, though less critical than for aircraft, is still important.\n\nGas turbines offer a high-powered engine in a very small and light package. However, they are not as responsive and efficient as small piston engines over the wide range of RPMs and powers needed in vehicle applications. In [[Series hybrid|series hybrid vehicles]], as the driving electric motors are mechanically detached from the electricity generating engine, the responsiveness, poor performance at low speed and low efficiency at low output problems are much less important. The turbine can be run at optimum speed for its power output, and batteries and [[Electric double-layer capacitor|ultracapacitors]] can supply power as needed, with the engine cycled on and off to run it only at high efficiency. The emergence of the [[continuously variable transmission]] may also alleviate the responsiveness problem.\n\nTurbines have historically been more expensive to produce than piston engines, though this is partly because piston engines have been mass-produced in huge quantities for decades, while small gas turbine engines are rarities; however, turbines are mass-produced in the closely related form of the [[turbocharger]].\n\nThe turbocharger is basically a compact and simple free shaft radial gas turbine which is driven by the piston engine's [[exhaust gas]]. The centripetal turbine wheel drives a [[centrifugal compressor]] wheel through a common rotating shaft. This wheel supercharges the engine air intake to a degree that can be controlled by means of a [[wastegate]] or by dynamically modifying the turbine housing's geometry (as in a [[Variable geometry turbocharger|VGT]] turbocharger).\nIt mainly serves as a power recovery device which converts a great deal of otherwise wasted thermal and kinetic energy into engine [[Turbo|boost]].\n\n[[Turbo-compound engine]]s (actually employed on some [[Semi-trailer truck|truck]]s) are fitted with blow down turbines which are similar in design and appearance to a turbocharger\nexcept for the turbine shaft being mechanically or hydraulically connected to the engine's crankshaft instead of to a centrifugal compressor, thus providing additional power instead of boost.\nWhile the turbocharger is a pressure turbine, a power recovery turbine is a velocity one.\n\n===Passenger road vehicles (cars, bikes, and buses)===\nA number of experiments have been conducted with gas turbine powered [[automobile]]s, the largest by [[Chrysler]].<ref>[http://www.turbinecar.com/misc/History.pdf \"History of Chrysler Corporation Gas Turbine Vehicles\"] published by the Engineering Section 1979</ref><ref>[http://automobileart.homestead.com/ChryslerConceptCars.html \"Chrysler Corp., Exner Concept Cars 1940 to 1961\" undated], retrieved on 11 May 2008.</ref> More recently, there has been some interest in the use of turbine engines for hybrid electric cars. For instance, a consortium led by micro gas turbine company [[Bladon Jets]] has secured investment from the Technology Strategy Board to develop an Ultra Lightweight Range Extender (ULRE) for next-generation electric vehicles. The objective of the consortium, which includes luxury car maker Jaguar Land Rover and leading electrical machine company SR Drives, is to produce the world's first commercially viable - and environmentally friendly - gas turbine generator designed specifically for automotive applications.<ref name=\"bladon\">[http://www.bladonjets.com/news/bladon-jets-wins-tsb-award/ Bladon Jets And Jaguar Land Rover Win Funding For Gas Turbine Electric Vehicle Project] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120313215440/http://www.bladonjets.com/news/bladon-jets-wins-tsb-award/ |date=13 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe common turbocharger for gasoline or diesel engines is also a turbine derivative.\n\n====Concept cars====\n[[File:Rover.jet1.jpg|thumb|The 1950 [[Rover Company|Rover]] JET1]]\n\nThe first serious investigation of using a gas turbine in cars was in 1946 when two engineers, Robert Kafka and Robert Engerstein of Carney Associates, a New York engineering firm, came up with the concept where a unique compact turbine engine design would provide power for a rear wheel drive car.

Since then, gas turbine engines have been used as [[auxiliary power unit|APUs]] in some tanks and as main powerplants in Soviet/Russian [[T-80]]s and U.S. [[M1 Abrams]] tanks, among others. They are lighter and smaller than [[diesel engine|diesels]] at the same sustained power output but the models installed to date are less fuel efficient than the equivalent diesel, especially at idle, requiring more fuel to achieve the same combat range. Successive models of M1 have addressed this problem with battery packs or secondary generators to power the tank's systems while stationary, saving fuel by reducing the need to idle the main turbine. T-80s can mount three large external fuel drums to extend their range. Russia has stopped production of the T-80 in favor of the diesel-powered [[T-90]] (based on the [[T-72]]), while Ukraine has developed the diesel-powered T-80UD and T-84 with nearly the power of the gas-turbine tank. The French [[Leclerc tank|Leclerc]] MBT's diesel powerplant features the \"Hyperbar\" hybrid supercharging system, where the engine's turbocharger is completely replaced with a small gas turbine which also works as an assisted diesel exhaust turbocharger, enabling engine RPM-independent boost level control and a higher peak boost pressure to be reached (than with ordinary turbochargers). This system allows a smaller displacement and lighter engine to be used as the tank's powerplant and effectively removes [[turbo lag]]. This special gas turbine/turbocharger can also work independently from the main engine as an ordinary APU.\n\nA turbine is theoretically more reliable and easier to maintain than a piston engine since it has a simpler construction with fewer moving parts, but in practice, turbine parts experience a higher wear rate due to their higher working speeds. The turbine blades are highly sensitive to dust and fine sand so that in desert operations air filters have to be fitted and changed several times daily. An improperly fitted filter, or a bullet or shell fragment that punctures the filter, can damage the engine. Piston engines (especially if turbocharged) also need well-maintained filters, but they are more resilient if the filter does fail.\n\nLike most modern diesel engines used in tanks, gas turbines are usually multi-fuel engines.\n\n===Marine applications===\n{{main|Marine propulsion}}\n\n====Naval====\n[[File:Gas turbine from MGB 2009.jpg|thumb|The Gas turbine from MGB 2009]]\n\nGas turbines are used in many [[naval vessel]]s, where they are valued for their high [[power-to-weight ratio]] and their ships' resulting acceleration and ability to get underway quickly.\n\nThe first gas-turbine-powered naval vessel was the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Motor Gun Boat]] ''MGB 2009'' (formerly ''MGB 509'') converted in 1947.

While interest in the gas turbine for marine purposes, both naval and mercantile, continued to increase, the lack of availability of the results of operating experience on early gas turbine projects limited the number of new ventures on seagoing commercial vessels being embarked upon. In 1951, the Diesel-electric oil tanker ''Auris'', 12,290 [[Deadweight tonnage]] (DWT) was used to obtain operating experience with a main propulsion gas turbine under service conditions at sea and so became the first ocean-going merchant ship to be powered by a gas turbine. Built by [[Hawthorn Leslie and Company|Hawthorn Leslie]] at [[Hebburn-on-Tyne]], UK, in accordance with plans and specifications drawn up by the [[Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company]] and launched on the UK's [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]]'s 21st birthday in 1947, the ship was designed with an engine room layout that would allow for the experimental use of heavy fuel in one of its high-speed engines, as well as the future substitution of one of its diesel engines by a gas turbine.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1559-3584.1954.tb03976.x|title = Operation of a Marine Gas Turbine Under Sea Conditions|journal = Journal of the American Society for Naval Engineers| volume=66| issue=2| pages=457\u2013466|year = 2009}}</ref> The ''Auris'' operated commercially as a tanker for three-and-a-half years with a diesel-electric propulsion unit as originally commissioned, but in 1951 one of its four {{convert|1105|bhp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} diesel engines \u2013 which were known as \"Faith\", \"Hope\", \"Charity\" and \"Prudence\" - was replaced by the world's first marine gas turbine engine, a {{convert|1200|bhp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} open-cycle gas turbo-alternator built by [[British Thomson-Houston|British Thompson-Houston Company]] in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]. Following successful sea trials off the Northumbrian coast, the ''Auris'' set sail from Hebburn-on-Tyne in October 1951 bound for [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] in the US and then [[Curacao]] in the southern Caribbean returning to [[Avonmouth]] after 44 days at sea, successfully completing her historic trans-Atlantic crossing. During this time at sea the gas turbine burnt diesel fuel and operated without an involuntary stop or mechanical difficulty of any kind. She subsequently visited Swansea, Hull, [[Rotterdam]], [[Oslo]] and Southampton covering a total of 13,211 nautical miles. The ''Auris'' then had all of its power plants replaced with a {{convert|5250|shp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} directly coupled gas turbine to become the first civilian ship to operate solely on gas turbine power.\n\nDespite the success of this early experimental voyage the gas turbine did not replace the diesel engine as the propulsion plant for large merchant ships. At constant cruising speeds the diesel engine simply had no peer in the vital area of fuel economy. The gas turbine did have more success in Royal Navy ships and the other naval fleets of the world where sudden and rapid changes of speed are required by warships in action.<ref>{{cite book|title=Future Ship Powering Options: Exploring alternative methods of ship propulsion|publisher=Royal Academy of Engineering Prince Philip House|isbn=9781909327016|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/reports/future-ship-powering-options|year=2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Maritime Commission]] were looking for options to update WWII [[Liberty ships]], and heavy-duty gas turbines were one of those selected. In 1956 the ''John Sergeant'' was lengthened and equipped with a [[General Electric]] {{convert|6600|shp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} HD gas turbine with exhaust-gas regeneration, reduction gearing and a [[variable-pitch propeller]]. It operated for 9,700 hours using residual fuel([[Bunker C]]) for 7,000 hours. Fuel efficiency was on a par with steam propulsion at {{convert|0.523|lb/hp|abbr=on|order=flip}} per hour,<ref name=\"IMGT\">Naval Education and Training Program Development Center ''Introduction to Marine Gas Turbines'' (1978) Naval Education and Training Support Command, pp. 3.</ref> and power output was higher than expected at {{convert|7514|shp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} due to the ambient temperature of the North Sea route being lower than the design temperature of the gas turbine. This gave the ship a speed capability of 18 knots, up from 11 knots with the original power plant, and well in excess of the 15 knot targeted. The ship made its first transatlantic crossing with an average speed of 16.8 knots, in spite of some rough weather along the way. Suitable Bunker C fuel was only available at limited ports because the quality of the fuel was of a critical nature. The fuel oil also had to be treated on board to reduce contaminants and this was a labor-intensive process that was not suitable for automation at the time. Ultimately, the variable-pitch propeller, which was of a new and untested design, ended the trial, as three consecutive annual inspections revealed stress-cracking. This did not reflect poorly on the marine-propulsion gas-turbine concept though, and the trial was a success overall. The success of this trial opened the way for more development by GE on the use of HD gas turbines for marine use with heavy fuels.<ref name=\"Innovation\">National Research Council (U.S.) ''Innovation in the Maritime Industry'' (1979) Maritime Transportation Research Board, pp. 127-131</ref> The ''John Sergeant'' was scrapped in 1972 at Portsmouth PA.\n\n[[File:20091105-TurboJET Urzela.jpg|thumb|Boeing Jetfoil 929-100-007 ''Urzela'' of [[TurboJET]]]]\n[[Boeing]] launched its first passenger-carrying [[Pump-jet|waterjet]]-propelled [[hydrofoil]] [[Boeing 929]], in April 1974.

Those ships were powered by twin [[Pratt & Whitney]] gas turbines of the FT 4 series. The four ships in the class were named ''Euroliner'', ''Eurofreighter'', ''Asialiner'' and ''Asiafreighter''. Following the dramatic [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC) price increases of the mid-1970s, operations were constrained by rising fuel costs. Some modification of the engine systems on those ships was undertaken to permit the burning of a lower grade of fuel (i.e., [[Marine diesel oil|marine diesel]]). Reduction of fuel costs was successful using a different untested fuel in a marine gas turbine but maintenance costs increased with the fuel change. After 1981 the ships were sold and refitted with, what at the time, was more economical diesel-fueled engines but the increased engine size reduced cargo space.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe first passenger ferry to use a gas turbine was the [[GTS Finnjet|GTS ''Finnjet'']], built in 1977 and powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney]] FT 4C-1 DLF turbines, generating {{convert|55000|kW|shp|abbr=on}} and propelling the ship to a speed of 31&nbsp;knots. However, the Finnjet also illustrated the shortcomings of gas turbine propulsion in commercial craft, as high fuel prices made operating her unprofitable. After four years of service, additional diesel engines were installed on the ship to reduce running costs during the off-season. The Finnjet was also the first ship with a [[Combined diesel-electric and gas]] propulsion. Another example of commercial use of gas turbines in a passenger ship is [[Stena Line]]'s [[High-speed Sea Service|HSS class]] fastcraft ferries.

Development is actively producing both smaller gas turbines and more powerful and efficient engines. Aiding in these advances are computer-based design (specifically [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] and [[finite element analysis]]) and the development of advanced materials: Base materials with superior high-temperature strength (e.g., [[single-crystal]] [[superalloy]]s that exhibit [[yield strength anomaly]]) or [[thermal barrier coatings]] that protect the structural material from ever-higher temperatures. These advances allow higher [[compression ratio]]s and turbine inlet temperatures, more efficient combustion and better cooling of engine parts.\n\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has contributed to substantial improvements in the performance and efficiency of Gas Turbine engine components through enhanced understanding of the complex viscous flow and heat transfer phenomena involved. For this reason, CFD is one of the key computational tool used in Design & development of gas<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hcltech.com/sites/default/files/CFD_for_Aero_Engines.pdf |title=CFD for Aero Engines |publisher=HCL Technologies |date=April 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chrystie|first=R|last2=Burns|first2=I|last3=Kaminski|first3=C|date=2013|title=Temperature Response of an Acoustically Forced Turbulent Lean Premixed Flame: A Quantitative Experimental Determination|journal=Combustion Science and Technology|volume=185|pages=180\u2013199|doi=10.1080/00102202.2012.714020}}</ref> turbine engines.\n\nThe simple-cycle efficiencies of early gas turbines were practically doubled by incorporating inter-cooling, regeneration (or recuperation), and reheating. These improvements, of course, come at the expense of increased initial and operation costs, and they cannot be justified unless the decrease in fuel costs offsets the increase in other costs. The relatively low fuel prices, the general desire in the industry to minimize installation costs, and the tremendous increase in the simple-cycle efficiency to about 40 percent left little desire for opting for these modifications.<ref>{{cite book |last1=\u00c7engel |first1=Yunus A. |first2=Michael A. |last2=Boles. |title=9-8.

These can withstand over a hundred thousand start/stop cycles and have eliminated the need for an oil system. The application of microelectronics and [[power switching]] technology have enabled the development of commercially viable electricity generation by microturbines for distribution and vehicle propulsion.\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\nThe following are advantages and disadvantages of gas-turbine engines:<ref>{{cite web|last=Brain |first=Marshall |url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/turbine2.htm |title=How Gas Turbine Engines Work |publisher=Science.howstuffworks.com |date=1 April 2000 |accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Advantages===\n* Very high [[power-to-weight ratio]] compared to reciprocating engines.\n* Smaller than most reciprocating engines of the same power rating.\n* Smooth rotation of the main shaft produces far less vibration than a reciprocating engine.\n* Fewer moving parts than reciprocating engines results in lower maintenance cost and higher reliability/availability over its service life.\n* Greater reliability, particularly in applications where sustained high power output is required.\n* Waste heat is dissipated almost entirely in the exhaust. This results in a high-temperature exhaust stream that is very usable for boiling water in a [[combined cycle]], or for [[cogeneration]].\n* Lower peak combustion pressures than reciprocating engines in general.\n* High shaft speeds in smaller \"free turbine units\", although larger gas turbines employed in power generation operate at synchronous speeds.\n* Low lubricating oil cost and consumption.\n* Can run on a wide variety of fuels.\n* Very low toxic emissions of CO and HC due to excess air, complete combustion and no \"quench\" of the flame on cold surfaces.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n* Core engine costs can be high due to use of exotic materials.\n* Less efficient than reciprocating engines at idle speed.\n* Longer startup than reciprocating engines.\n* Less responsive to changes in power demand compared with reciprocating engines.\n* Characteristic whine can be hard to suppress.\n\n==Testing==\nBritish, German, other national and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test gas turbines. Selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance to the design of the turbine and associated systems. In the United States, [[ASME]] has produced several performance test codes on gas turbines. This includes ASME PTC 22-2014. These ASME performance test codes have gained international recognition and acceptance for testing gas turbines. The single most important and differentiating characteristic of ASME performance test codes, including PTC 22, is that the test uncertainty of the measurement indicates the quality of the test and is not to be used as a commercial tolerance.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Air-start system]]\n*[[Axial compressor]]\n*[[Centrifugal compressor]]\n*[[Distributed generation]]\n*[[Gas turbine-electric locomotive]]\n*[[Gas turbine locomotive]]\n*[[Gas turbine modular helium reactor]]\n*[[Non-intrusive stress measurement system|Non-intrusive stress measurement]]\n*[[Pneumatic motor]]\n*[[Steam turbine]]\n*[[Turbine engine failure]]\n*[[Wind turbine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110317172825/http://articles.compressionjobs.com/articles/oilfield-101/168-gas-turbines-principles-lube-control-systems-overspeed Stationary Combustion Gas Turbines including Oil & Over-Speed Control System description]\n*\"Aircraft Gas Turbine Technology\" by Irwin E.

The town was and still is a site of a crossroads which help to serve [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and points to the north.\n\nOne of the founding fathers of Rehoboth was [[Samuel Newman]], a clergyman from [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]] who moved to the [[Sakonnet|Seconet]] area near to [[Little Compton, Rhode Island|Little Compton]] in the [[Plymouth Colony]]. Samuel Newman and his followers migrated north and established a huge town common in what is now [[Rumford, Rhode Island]]. They gave the roundabout a distinctive name: \"The Ring of the Green.\" [[Newman Congregational Church]] (founded 1643, current building dates to 1810) still stands at the intersections of Pawtucket Ave, Newman Ave and Ferris Ave.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastprovidenceri.net/content/658/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006174407/http://www.eastprovidenceri.net/content/658/default.aspx |archive-date=2014-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The area was known as Rehoboth village.  Somewhat of a celebrity, Newman's famous bible concordance (the third ever printed in English) had just been published in London.  He spent the next few years revising the concordance with a second edition published in 1650 that includes on the title page, \"By Samuel Newman, now teacher of the Church at Rehoboth in New England.\"  According to legend, he worked on the revisions by burning pine knots instead of candles. The concordance, later called the Cambridge Concordance, was reprinted as late as 1889, almost 250 years after it was first published by the founder of Rehoboth.\n\n[[File:Headstone Capt Samuel Peck Rehoboth Massachusetts.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Headstone]] of Capt. Samuel Peck, son of Joseph Peck, one of the original settlers of Rehoboth. Peck Burial Yard, Historic Cemetery #13]]\nThe [[Rehoboth Carpenter family]] was one of the founding families. Among the earliest purchasers of the land that is now Rehoboth and nearby communities was the Peck family, who came from nearby Hingham, Massachusetts, initially. Joseph Peck, the brother of the Rev. Robert Peck,[4] the disaffected Puritan who had fled his Hingham church in England, after the crackdown by Archbishop Laud, had purchased sizable tracts of lands from the Native Americans. Peck's son was fined fifty shillings for making continuous sexual advances toward the maid.[5] Peck died in Rehoboth in 1697. These tracts of land Peck willed to his son Samuel, who served as Deputy to the General Court at Plymouth, as well as the first representative from the town of Rehoboth after the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts were united. The family continued to live in the area through the twentieth century. Today's Pecks Corner in Rehoboth is named for this early Puritan family.[6]\n\n===King Philip's War (1675\u20131676)===\n[[Image:Anawan Rock Sign.jpg|thumb|right|Sign at Anawan Rock Historic Site]]\nRehoboth was a significant site during [[King Philip's War]].

Upon incorporation, members of the Rehoboth community and Newman Church (in present-day East Providence, Rhode Island) elected to collect funds to pay a teacher for the settlement's children. Church and government were closely tied in early colonial villages, so the word 'public' refers instead to access to education by all children in the community, not just those of wealthy parents. Another town landmark is related to education: The historic [[Hornbine School]], built in 1845, is located in the southeast corner of town and is open to the public for visiting and educational purposes from May to September.\n\n===350th anniversary===\n\nFor the town's 350th anniversary in 1992, the town conducted a promotional \"take back\" of the communities that were once the original Rehoboth.  With encouragement from musket-bearing members of the 13th Continental Regiment, Rehoboth Minutemen, other towns and cities ceremonially 'returned' their land for the duration of the anniversary year celebration.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:Rehoboth a right to farm community.jpg|200px|thumb|Rehoboth is a Rights Farm community|right]]\nToday Rehoboth is a mostly rural, suburban community with many historic sites including 53 historic cemeteries.

The town was and still is a site of a crossroads which help to serve [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and points to the north.\n\nOne of the founding fathers of Rehoboth was [[Samuel Newman]], a clergyman from [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]] who moved to the [[Sakonnet|Seconet]] area near to [[Little Compton, Rhode Island|Little Compton]] in the [[Plymouth Colony]]. Samuel Newman and his followers migrated north and established a huge town common in what is now [[Rumford, Rhode Island]]. They gave the roundabout a distinctive name: \"The Ring of the Green.\" [[Newman Congregational Church]] (founded 1643, current building dates to 1810) still stands at the intersections of Pawtucket Ave, Newman Ave and Ferris Ave.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastprovidenceri.net/content/658/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006174407/http://www.eastprovidenceri.net/content/658/default.aspx |archive-date=2014-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The area was known as Rehoboth village.  Somewhat of a celebrity, Newman's famous bible concordance (the third ever printed in English) had just been published in London.  He spent the next few years revising the concordance with a second edition published in 1650 that includes on the title page, \"By Samuel Newman, now teacher of the Church at Rehoboth in New England.\"  According to legend, he worked on the revisions by burning pine knots instead of candles. The concordance, later called the Cambridge Concordance, was reprinted as late as 1889, almost 250 years after it was first published by the founder of Rehoboth.\n\n[[File:Headstone Capt Samuel Peck Rehoboth Massachusetts.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Headstone]] of Capt. Samuel Peck, son of Joseph Peck, one of the original settlers of Rehoboth. Peck Burial Yard, Historic Cemetery #13]]\nThe [[Rehoboth Carpenter family]] was one of the founding families. Among the earliest purchasers of the land that is now Rehoboth and nearby communities was the Peck family, who came from nearby Hingham, Massachusetts, initially. Joseph Peck, the brother of the Rev. Robert Peck,[4] the disaffected Puritan who had fled his Hingham church in England, after the crackdown by Archbishop Laud, had purchased sizable tracts of lands from the Native Americans. Peck's son was fined fifty shillings for making continuous sexual advances toward the maid.[5] Peck died in Rehoboth in 1697. These tracts of land Peck willed to his son Samuel, who served as Deputy to the General Court at Plymouth, as well as the first representative from the town of Rehoboth after the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts were united. The family continued to live in the area through the twentieth century. Today's Pecks Corner in Rehoboth is named for this early Puritan family.[6]\n\n===King Philip's War (1675\u20131676)===\n[[Image:Anawan Rock Sign.jpg|thumb|right|Sign at Anawan Rock Historic Site]]\nRehoboth was a significant site during [[King Philip's War]].

Upon incorporation, members of the Rehoboth community and Newman Church (in present-day East Providence, Rhode Island) elected to collect funds to pay a teacher for the settlement's children. Church and government were closely tied in early colonial villages, so the word 'public' refers instead to access to education by all children in the community, not just those of wealthy parents. Another town landmark is related to education: The historic [[Hornbine School]], built in 1845, is located in the southeast corner of town and is open to the public for visiting and educational purposes from May to September.\n\n===350th anniversary===\n\nFor the town's 350th anniversary in 1992, the town conducted a promotional \"take back\" of the communities that were once the original Rehoboth.  With encouragement from musket-bearing members of the 13th Continental Regiment, Rehoboth Minutemen, other towns and cities ceremonially 'returned' their land for the duration of the anniversary year celebration.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:Rehoboth a right to farm community.jpg|200px|thumb|Rehoboth is a Right to Farm community|right]]\nToday Rehoboth is a mostly rural, suburban community with many historic sites including 53 historic cemeteries.

The Blanding Book Club meets monthly.  A group for needleworkers (knitting, crochet, etc.) meets twice a month at the library.  Programs are offered for children, from pre-schoolers up, including reading, arts/crafts, summer programs, performances, visiting exhibits and other special events.\n\nEach month Poetry in the Village hosts an open microphone night and featured guest at the Blanding LIbrary in Goff Memorial Hall. This group is independent from the library.  The public is invited to participate.\n\nMany cultural events held in Rehoboth are supported in part by grants from the Rehoboth Cultural Council, an affiliate of the Massachusetts Cultural Council.  Members of the council, although appointed by town selectmen, operate independently from town government and award grants on a yearly basis with funds allotted by the state organization. Several non-profit organizations based in Rehoboth provide resources or cultural events.\n\nThe Rehoboth Country Dance Society, founded in 1981, holds public [[contra dance]]s with acclaimed musicians and callers at least twice monthly at Goff Memorial Hall.  A monthly community dance is held on a Sunday evening with the Sunday Night Jammers, also at Goff Memorial Hall.\n\nFor those interested in history, the 13th Continental Regiment Rehoboth Minute Company, originally chartered in 1774, was recommissioned in 1992 as part of the town's 350 anniversary celebration. It was incorporated three years later as a non-profit, educational organization.  The present recreated group portrays the original 1774 unit in civilian dress, accoutrements and firearms. Men, women and children participate in the unit as musketmen, drummers, fifers and assorted characters. The well-known group of re-enactors are invited to participate in parades, ceremonies, encampments, and battle re-enactments, as well as visiting schools throughout the region.\n\nEach September, the town events committee hosts the Annual 'Larry Procopio' Harvest Block Party, a free event held on the Redway Plain field off Route 44.  The event was named after the late Larry Procopio, an active member of the community who first organized the yearly event.\n[[File:Hornbine School, Rehoboth Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|right|Hornbine School]]\nThe town's historic one-room school house, the Hornbine School, is open spring and summer for visits and tours. The school, operated from 1848 to 1937, was restored in 1969 and now belongs to the town under the jurisdiction of the historical commission, and tended carefully by the non-profit Horbine School Association.\n\n==Government==\nThe town is part of the Fourth Bristol state representative district, including Seekonk and parts of Swansea and Norton.  In the state senate, the town is part of the Bristol and Norfolk district, which includes part of the city of Attleboro and all or part of the towns of Dover, Foxborough, Mansfield, Medfield, Norton, Seekonk, Sharon and Walpole.  Rehoboth is patrolled by Troop D (Southeast District), 4th Barracks (located in Middleborough) of the [[Massachusetts State Police]].  On the national level, the town is part of [[Massachusetts's 4th congressional district]], which is represented by [[Joseph Kennedy III]].  The state's senators are: [[Ed Markey]], and [[Elizabeth Warren]].\n\nRehoboth municipal government operates from town offices located in a one-story building on Peck Street, previously a [[Project Nike]] site.\n\nMunicipal government is overseen by a five-member [[board of selectmen]] and a town administrator. Residents may vote on town governing issues at town meetings which are held in the spring and fall. The current board of selectmen consists of: Gerald Schwall (chair), James Muri (vice-chairman), Dave Perry (clerk), Frederick \"Skip\" Vadnais, and Michael Costello.  The town administrator is Helen Dennen who manages the operation of the town offices and personnel.\n\n[[File:Rehoboth Massachusetts Police and Fire Headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|Police and Fire station on Anawan Street]]\nThe town has a central Police and Fire station (Public Safety Building) on Anawan Street (Route 118).  There are two additional fire stations: North Station (#2) located on Tremont Street; South Station (#3) located on Pleasant Street.  The RFD is an on-call department with trained firefighters. Only the fire chief is a full-time employee of the town.  The Rehoboth Rescue Squad has served the community for the past 46 years and is the town's only 100% unpaid volunteer public safety organization.  Rehoboth Ambulance is an independent, non-profit organization that provides vehicles, equipment, supplies and staffing stipends without direct funding from the town.  In cases of emergency or disaster, the Rehoboth Emergency Management Agency (REMA) coordinates efforts of all the public safety entities.  The Highway Department and Forestry service is located down the road from police/fire headquarters.\n\nAn additional town-owned building, located on Anawan Street, houses Rehoboth Community TV, the local public access cable television service.  Operation of public programming on three channels (Government Channel 9, Education Channel 15 and Public Channel 98) is the responsibility of the town's Cable Advisory Committee and town employees. Some municipal meetings are broadcast live while others are recorded and broadcast at various times. Many are also available for viewing on their website, http://www.RehobothTV.org\n\nThe town owns the Gladys L. Hurrell Senior Center located on Bay State Road.  The Rehoboth Council on Aging consists of board members appointed by the selectmen.  They oversee the operation of the senior center which is managed by Linda Sherman, a town employee.  Residents often refer to the building itself as the Council on Aging. The center offers a wide range of activities and services for elders Monday thru Friday.  The building is also used for municipal meetings, private and public events.\n\nMilitary veterans in Rehoboth are supported by the town's Veterans Services Department located at the town office.  The Veteran's agent Jake Kramer works with veterans of all ages to help them access services.   In 2012, residents voted at town meeting to adopt provisions of the Massachusetts Valor Act so that local veterans can perform municipal work to offset their property tax bills.\n\n==Education==\nRehoboth's educational system can be traced back to the earliest days of the town (see \"History\" for more details). The Dighton-Rehoboth Regional School District was formed in 1958 and expanded to include all schools in both Rehoboth and neighboring Dighton.\n\nRehoboth schools include Palmer River Elementary School on Winthrop Street (Route 44) and D.
