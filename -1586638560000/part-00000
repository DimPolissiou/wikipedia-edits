''[[The Unbeatables I|The Unbeatables]]'' received the award and it is given in honour of a [[Mediacorp]] drama serial which has delivered an outstanding overall performance. The nominees are determined by a team of judges employed by Mediacorp; winners are selected by a majority vote from the entire judging panel.\n\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 22 drama serials. ''Blessings 2'' was the most recent winner in this category. Since the ceremony held in 2016, ''[[The Dream Makers (TV series)|The Dream Makers]]'' is also the only drama serial to win in this category twice. In addition, ''[[C.L.I.F.]]'' has been nominated on four occasions, more than any other drama serial. It also holds the record for the most nominations without a win.\n\n==Winners And Nominees==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Table key\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86; height:20px; width:20px\"|\n| Indicates the winner\n|}\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"2%\" | Year\n! width=\"20%\" | Drama\n|-\n| colspan=5 data-sort-value=\"\u03c9\" style=\"background-color:#CACCD0;

By inserting (called ''[[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalating]]'' in technical terminology) an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is a [[common year]].\n\nFor example, in the [[Gregorian calendar]], each leap year has 366 days instead of 365, by [[February 29|extending February to 29 days]] rather than the common 28. These extra days occur in each year which is an [[integer]] multiple of 4 (except for years evenly divisible by 100, which are not leap years unless evenly divisible by 400). Similarly, in the lunisolar [[Hebrew calendar]], [[Adar 1|Adar Aleph]], a 13th lunar month, is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons. In the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Calendar]], a leap day is added when needed to ensure that the following year begins on the [[March equinox]].  Shut up... 2007 was an actual leap year..!

Unlike leap days, leap seconds are not introduced on a regular schedule because variations in the length of the day are not entirely predictable.\n\nLeap years can present a problem in computing, known as the [[leap year bug]], when a year is not correctly identified as a leap year or when February 29 is not handled correctly in logic that accepts or manipulates dates.\n\n==Gregorian calendar==\n{{See also|Gregorian calendar}}\n[[File:Leap Centuries.jpg|thumb|right|An image showing which century years are leap years in the Gregorian calendar]]\nIn the Gregorian calendar, the standard calendar in most of the world, most years that are multiples of 4 are leap years. In each leap year, the month of February has 29 days instead of 28. Adding one extra day in the calendar every four years compensates for the fact that a period of 365 days is shorter than a [[tropical year]] by almost 6 hours.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Ed. K.

The [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian reform]] modified the Julian calendar's scheme of leap years as follows:\n<blockquote>Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php Introduction to Calendars]. (10 August 2017). [[United States Naval Observatory]].</ref></blockquote>\n\nOver a period of four centuries, the accumulated error of adding a leap day ''every'' four years amounts to about three extra days. The Gregorian calendar therefore drops three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its ''leap cycle''. This is done by dropping February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400.<ref name=\"usno\">{{citation | author = United States Naval Observatory | authorlink = United States Naval Observatory | date = June 14, 2011 | url = http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/leap_years.php | title = Leap Years}}</ref>{{sfn|Lerner|Lerner|2004|p=681}} The years 1600, 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200 and 2300 are not leap years.

It is not valid for the BC or BCE notation. The algorithm is not necessarily valid for years in the Julian calendar, such as years before 1752 in the British Empire. The year 1700 was a leap year in the Julian calendar, but not in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n===Leap day===\n{{Main|February 29|bissextus|February 24}}\n[[File:Calendar-leapyeardate.jpg|thumb|right|A Swedish pocket calendar from 2008 showing February 29]]\n[[File:Japanese Calendar with Verses by Osman Edwards 1900 February.jpg|thumb|February 1900 calendar showing that 1900 was not a leap year]]\n\nFebruary 29 is a date that usually occurs every four years, and is called the leap day. This day is added to the calendar in leap years as a corrective measure, because the Earth does not orbit the sun in precisely 365 days.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar is a modification of the [[Julian calendar]] first used by the Romans. The [[Roman calendar]] originated as a lunisolar calendar and named many of its days after the [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygies]] of the moon: the new moon (''Kalendae'' or calends, hence \"calendar\") and the full moon (''Idus'' or ides). The ''Nonae'' or nones was not the first [[Lunar phase|quarter moon]] but was exactly one ''nundina'' or Roman market week of nine days before the ides, inclusively counting the ides as the first of those nine days. This is what we would call a period of eight days. In 1825, [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]] believed that the lunisolar calendar was abandoned about 450 BC by the [[decemvirs]], who implemented the [[Roman calendar|Roman Republican calendar]], used until 46 BC. The days of these calendars were counted down (inclusively) to the next named day, so February 24 was ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' (\"the sixth day before the calends of March\") often abbreviated a. d. VI Kal. Mart. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] counted days inclusively in their calendars, so this was actually the fifth day before March 1 when counted in the modern exclusive manner (not including the starting day).<ref>{{citation | first = Thomas Hewitt | last = Key | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html | title = Calendarium | publisher = University of Chicago | orig-year = 1875 | date = 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Republican calendar's intercalary month was inserted on the first or second day after the [[Terminus (mythology)|Terminalia]] (a. d. VII Kal. Mar., February 23). The remaining days of Februarius were dropped. This intercalary month, named Intercalaris or [[Mercedonius]], contained 27 days. The religious festivals that were normally celebrated in the last five days of February were moved to the last five days of Intercalaris. Because only 22 or 23 days were effectively added, not a full lunation, the calends and ides of the Roman Republican calendar were no longer associated with the new moon and full moon.\n\nThe Julian calendar, which was developed in 46 BC by [[Julius Caesar]], and became effective in 45 BC, distributed an extra ten days among the months of the Roman Republican calendar. Caesar also replaced the intercalary month by a single intercalary day, located where the intercalary month used to be. To create the intercalary day, the existing ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' (February 24) was doubled, producing ''ante diem bis sextum Kalendas Martias''. Hence, the year containing the doubled day was a bissextile (''bis sextum'', \"twice sixth\") year. For legal purposes, the two days of the ''bis sextum'' were considered to be a single day, with the second half being intercalated; but in common practice by 238, when [[Censorinus]] wrote, the intercalary day was followed by the last five days of February, a. d. VI, V, IV, III and pridie Kal. Mart. (the days numbered 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 from the beginning of February in a common year), so that the intercalated day was the ''first'' half of the doubled day. Thus the intercalated day was effectively inserted between the 23rd and 24th days of February. All later writers, including [[Macrobius]] about 430, [[Bede]] in 725, and other medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of Easter), continued to state that the bissextum (bissextile day) occurred before the last five days of February.\n\n[[File:MissaleLeapYear.jpg|thumb|right|In the older [[Roman Missal]], feast days falling on or after February 24 are celebrated one day later in leap year.]]\nUntil 1970, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] always celebrated the feast of [[Saint Matthias]] on a. d. VI Kal. Mart., so if the days were numbered from the beginning of the month, it was named February 24 in common years, but the presence of the bissextum in a bissextile year immediately before a. d. VI Kal. Mart. shifted the latter day to February 25 in leap years, with the [[Vigil]] of St. Matthias shifting from February 23 to the leap day of February 24. This shift did not take place in pre-Reformation Norway and Iceland; [[Pope Alexander III]] ruled that either practice was lawful ([[Liber Extra]], 5. 40. 14. 1). Other feasts normally falling on February 25\u201328 in common years are also shifted to the following day in a leap year (although they would be on the same day according to the Roman notation). The practice is still observed by those who use the older calendars.\n\n=== Synchronized calendars (Bengali, Indian and Thai) ===\nThe Revised [[Bengali Calendar]] of Bangladesh and the [[Indian National Calendar]] organise their leap years so that the every leap day is close to a February 29 in the Gregorian calendar and vice versa. This makes it easy to convert dates to or from Gregorian.\n\nThe [[Thai solar calendar]] uses the [[Buddhist Era]] (BE), but has been synchronized with the Gregorian since [[AD]] 1941.\n\n==Julian, Coptic and Ethiopian calendars==\nFrom AD 8 the Julian calendar received an extra day added to February in years that are multiples of 4.\n\nThe [[Coptic calendar]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]] also add an extra day to the end of the year once every four years before a Julian 29-day February.\n\nThis rule gives an average year length of 365.25 days. However, it is 11 minutes longer than a tropical year. This means that the vernal equinox moves a day earlier in the calendar about every 131 years.\n\n==Revised Julian calendar==\nThe [[Revised Julian calendar]] adds an extra day to February in years that are multiples of four, except for years that are multiples of 100 that do not leave a remainder of 200 or 600 when divided by 900. This rule agrees with the rule for the Gregorian calendar until 2799. The first year that dates in the Revised Julian calendar will not agree with those in the Gregorian calendar will be 2800, because it will be a leap year in the Gregorian calendar but not in the Revised Julian calendar.\n\nThis rule gives an average year length of 365.242222 days. This is a very good approximation to the ''mean'' tropical year, but because the ''vernal equinox'' year is slightly longer, the Revised Julian calendar for the time being does not do as good a job as the Gregorian calendar at keeping the vernal equinox on or close to March 21.\n\n==Chinese calendar==\nThe [[Chinese calendar]] is [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], so a leap year has an extra month, often called an ''embolismic'' month after the Greek word for it. In the Chinese calendar the [[leap month]] is added according to a rule which ensures that month 11 is always the month that contains the northern winter [[solstice]]. The intercalary month takes the same number as the preceding month; for example, if it follows the second month (\u4e8c\u6708) then it is simply called \"leap second month\" i.e. {{zh|t=\u958f\u4e8c\u6708|s=\u95f0\u4e8c\u6708|p=r\u00f9n'\u00e8ryu\u00e8}}.\n\n==Hebrew calendar==<!-- This section is linked from [[Jewish holiday]] -->\nThe Hebrew calendar is lunisolar with an [[embolismic month]]. This extra month is called ''Adar Alef'' ([[Adar 1|first Adar]]) and is added before ''[[Adar]]'', which then becomes ''Adar Bet'' ([[Adar 2|second Adar]]). According to the [[Metonic cycle]], this is done seven times every nineteen years (specifically, in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19). This is to ensure that [[Passover]] ({{transl|he|''Pesah''}}) is always in the spring as required by the [[Torah]] (Pentateuch) in many verses<ref>Exodus 23,15 ; Exodus 34,18 ; Deuteronomy 15,1 ; Deuteronomy 15, 13</ref> relating to Passover.\n\nIn addition, the Hebrew calendar has postponement rules that postpone the start of the year by one or two days. These postponement rules reduce the number of different combinations of year length and starting [[Week-day names|days of the week]] from 28 to 14, and regulate the location of certain religious holidays in relation to the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. In particular, the first day of the Hebrew year can never be Sunday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as \"{{transl|he|''lo adu rosh''}}\" ({{lang|he|\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d3\"\u05d5 \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9}}), i.e., \"Rosh [ha-Shanah, first day of the year] is not Sunday, Wednesday or Friday\" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''adu''}} is written by three [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] signifying Sunday, Wednesday and Friday). Accordingly, the first day of Passover is never Monday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as \"{{transl|he|''lo badu Pesah''}}\" ({{lang|he|\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d3\"\u05d5 \u05e4\u05e1\u05d7}}), which has a double meaning \u2014 \"Passover is not a legend\", but also \"Passover is not Monday, Wednesday or Friday\" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''badu''}} is written by three Hebrew letters signifying Monday, Wednesday and Friday).\n\nOne reason for this rule is that [[Yom Kippur]], the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar and the tenth day of the Hebrew year, now must never be adjacent to the weekly Sabbath (which is Saturday), i.e., it must never fall on Friday or Sunday, in order not to have two adjacent Sabbath days. However, Yom Kippur can still be on Saturday. A second reason is that [[Hoshana Rabbah]], the 21st day of the Hebrew year, will never be on Saturday. These rules for the Feasts do not apply to the years from the Creation to the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt under Moses. It was at that time (cf. Exodus 13) that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob gave the Hebrews their \"Law\" including the days to be kept holy and the feast days and Sabbaths.\n\nYears consisting of 12 months have between 353 and 355 days. In a {{transl|he|''k'sidra''}} (\"in order\") 354-day year, months have alternating 30 and 29 day lengths. In a {{transl|he|''chaser''}} (\"lacking\") year, the month of [[Kislev]] is reduced to 29 days. In a {{transl|he|''malei''}} (\"filled\") year, the month of [[Marcheshvan]] is increased to 30 days. 13-month years follow the same pattern, with the addition of the 30-day Adar Alef, giving them between 383 and 385 days.\n\n==Islamic calendar==\nThe observed and calculated versions of the [[Islamic calendar]] do not have regular leap days, even though both have lunar months containing 29 or 30 days, generally in alternating order. However, the [[tabular Islamic calendar]] used by Islamic astronomers during the Middle Ages and still used by some Muslims does have a regular leap day added to the last month of the lunar year in 11 years of a 30-year cycle.<ref name=timeanddateIslamicCalendar>{{citation | url=http://www.timeanddate.com/date/islam-leap-year.html | title = The Islamic leap year | date = n.d. | publisher = Time and Date AS | accessdate = February 29, 2012}}</ref> This additional day is found at the end of the last month, Dhu 'l-Hijja, which is also the month of the [[Hajj]].<ref name=GMANewsLeapYearTrivia>{{citation | url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/249829/lifestyle/people/leap-year-trivia-you-might-want-to-know | title = Leap year trivia you might want to know | date = n.d. | publisher = GMA News | accessdate = February 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Hijri-Shamsi calendar, also adopted by the [[Ahmadiyya]] Community, is based on solar calculations and is similar to the Gregorian calendar in its structure with the exception that the first year starts with [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]].<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/73.html | title=Hijri-Shamsi Calendar | publisher=Al Islam | date = 2015 | accessdate=April 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Bah\u00e1'\u00ed calendar==\n{{main | Bah\u00e1'\u00ed calendar }}\nThe Bah\u00e1'\u00ed calendar is a solar calendar composed of 19 months of 19 days each (361 days). Years begin at Naw-R\u00faz, on the [[vernal equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|vernal equinox]], on or about March 21. A period of \"Intercalary Days\", called [[Ayyam-i-Ha]], are inserted before the 19th month. This period normally has 4 days, but an extra day is added when needed to ensure that the following year starts on the [[vernal equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|vernal equinox]]. This is calculated and known years in advance.\n\n==Solar Hijri calendar==\n{{main | Solar Hijri calendar }}\nThe [[Iranian calendar#Modern calendar (Solar Hejri)|Iranian calendar]] is an observational calendar that starts on the [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|spring equinox]] and adds a single intercalated day to the last month (Esfand) once every four or five years; the first leap year occurs as the fifth year of the typical 33-year cycle and the remaining leap years occur every four years through the remainder of the 33-year cycle.

In some situations, March 1 is used as the birthday in a non-leap year, since it is the day following February 28.\n\nTechnically, a leapling will have fewer ''birthday anniversaries'' than their age in years. This phenomenon is exploited when a person claims to be only a quarter of their actual age, by counting their leap-year birthday anniversaries only: for example, in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1879 [[comic opera]] ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Frederic the pirate apprentice discovers that he is bound to serve the pirates until his 21st ''birthday'' (that is, when he turns 88 years old, since 1900 was not a leap year) rather than until his 21st ''year''.\n\nFor legal purposes, legal birthdays depend on how local laws count time intervals.\n\n===Taiwan===\n{{Wikisource|Civil Code Part I General Principles}}\nThe Civil Code of the [[Taiwan]] since October 10, 1929,<ref>{{citation | url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawHistory.aspx?PCode=B0000001 | title = Legislative History of the Civil Code of the Republic of China}}</ref> implies that the legal birthday of a leapling is February 28 in common years:\n\n{{quote|If a period fixed by weeks, months, and years does not commence from the beginning of a week, month, or year, it ends with the ending of the day which precedes the day of the last week, month, or year which corresponds to that on which it began to commence.

By inserting (called ''[[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalating]]'' in technical terminology) an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is a [[common year]].\n\nFor example, in the [[Gregorian calendar]], each leap year has 366 days instead of 365, by [[February 29|extending February to 29 days]] rather than the common 28. These extra days occur in each year which is an [[integer]] multiple of 4 (except for years evenly divisible by 100, which are not leap years unless evenly divisible by 400). Similarly, in the lunisolar [[Hebrew calendar]], [[Adar 1|Adar Aleph]], a 13th lunar month, is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons. In the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Calendar]], a leap day is added when needed to ensure that the following year begins on the [[March equinox]].\n\nThe term ''leap year'' probably comes from the fact that a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the next, but the day of the week in the 12 months following the leap day (from March 1 through February 28 of the following year) will advance two days due to the extra day, thus leaping over one day in the week.<ref>{{citation | first=Douglas | last=Harper | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=leap+year&allowed_in_frame=0 | title = leap year | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | date = 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/leap-year|title=leap year |website=Oxford US Dictionary | access-date = January 6, 2020}}</ref> For example, [[Christmas Day]] (December 25) fell on a Tuesday in 2012, Wednesday in 2013, Thursday in 2014, and Friday in 2015, but then leapt over Saturday to fall on a Sunday in 2016.\n\nThe length of a day is also occasionally corrected by inserting a [[leap second]] into [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) because of variations in Earth's [[rotation period]]. Unlike leap days, leap seconds are not introduced on a regular schedule because variations in the length of the day are not entirely predictable.\n\nLeap years can present a problem in computing, known as the [[leap year bug]], when a year is not correctly identified as a leap year or when February 29 is not handled correctly in logic that accepts or manipulates dates.\n\n==Gregorian calendar==\n{{See also|Gregorian calendar}}\n[[File:Leap Centuries.jpg|thumb|right|An image showing which century years are leap years in the Gregorian calendar]]\nIn the Gregorian calendar, the standard calendar in most of the world, most years that are multiples of 4 are leap years. In each leap year, the month of February has 29 days instead of 28. Adding one extra day in the calendar every four years compensates for the fact that a period of 365 days is shorter than a [[tropical year]] by almost 6 hours.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Ed. K.

The [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian reform]] modified the Julian calendar's scheme of leap years as follows:\n<blockquote>Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php Introduction to Calendars]. (10 August 2017). [[United States Naval Observatory]].</ref></blockquote>\n\nOver a period of four centuries, the accumulated error of adding a leap day ''every'' four years amounts to about three extra days. The Gregorian calendar therefore drops three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its ''leap cycle''. This is done by dropping February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400.<ref name=\"usno\">{{citation | author = United States Naval Observatory | authorlink = United States Naval Observatory | date = June 14, 2011 | url = http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/leap_years.php | title = Leap Years}}</ref>{{sfn|Lerner|Lerner|2004|p=681}} The years 1600, 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200 and 2300 are not leap years.

It is not valid for the BC or BCE notation. The algorithm is not necessarily valid for years in the Julian calendar, such as years before 1752 in the British Empire. The year 1700 was a leap year in the Julian calendar, but not in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n===Leap day===\n{{Main|February 29|bissextus|February 24}}\n[[File:Calendar-leapyeardate.jpg|thumb|right|A Swedish pocket calendar from 2008 showing February 29]]\n[[File:Japanese Calendar with Verses by Osman Edwards 1900 February.jpg|thumb|February 1900 calendar showing that 1900 was not a leap year]]\n\nFebruary 29 is a date that usually occurs every four years, and is called the leap day. This day is added to the calendar in leap years as a corrective measure, because the Earth does not orbit the sun in precisely 365 days.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar is a modification of the [[Julian calendar]] first used by the Romans. The [[Roman calendar]] originated as a lunisolar calendar and named many of its days after the [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygies]] of the moon: the new moon (''Kalendae'' or calends, hence \"calendar\") and the full moon (''Idus'' or ides). The ''Nonae'' or nones was not the first [[Lunar phase|quarter moon]] but was exactly one ''nundina'' or Roman market week of nine days before the ides, inclusively counting the ides as the first of those nine days. This is what we would call a period of eight days. In 1825, [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]] believed that the lunisolar calendar was abandoned about 450 BC by the [[decemvirs]], who implemented the [[Roman calendar|Roman Republican calendar]], used until 46 BC. The days of these calendars were counted down (inclusively) to the next named day, so February 24 was ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' (\"the sixth day before the calends of March\") often abbreviated a. d. VI Kal. Mart. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] counted days inclusively in their calendars, so this was actually the fifth day before March 1 when counted in the modern exclusive manner (not including the starting day).<ref>{{citation | first = Thomas Hewitt | last = Key | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html | title = Calendarium | publisher = University of Chicago | orig-year = 1875 | date = 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Republican calendar's intercalary month was inserted on the first or second day after the [[Terminus (mythology)|Terminalia]] (a. d. VII Kal. Mar., February 23). The remaining days of Februarius were dropped. This intercalary month, named Intercalaris or [[Mercedonius]], contained 27 days. The religious festivals that were normally celebrated in the last five days of February were moved to the last five days of Intercalaris. Because only 22 or 23 days were effectively added, not a full lunation, the calends and ides of the Roman Republican calendar were no longer associated with the new moon and full moon.\n\nThe Julian calendar, which was developed in 46 BC by [[Julius Caesar]], and became effective in 45 BC, distributed an extra ten days among the months of the Roman Republican calendar. Caesar also replaced the intercalary month by a single intercalary day, located where the intercalary month used to be. To create the intercalary day, the existing ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' (February 24) was doubled, producing ''ante diem bis sextum Kalendas Martias''. Hence, the year containing the doubled day was a bissextile (''bis sextum'', \"twice sixth\") year. For legal purposes, the two days of the ''bis sextum'' were considered to be a single day, with the second half being intercalated; but in common practice by 238, when [[Censorinus]] wrote, the intercalary day was followed by the last five days of February, a. d. VI, V, IV, III and pridie Kal. Mart. (the days numbered 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 from the beginning of February in a common year), so that the intercalated day was the ''first'' half of the doubled day. Thus the intercalated day was effectively inserted between the 23rd and 24th days of February. All later writers, including [[Macrobius]] about 430, [[Bede]] in 725, and other medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of Easter), continued to state that the bissextum (bissextile day) occurred before the last five days of February.\n\n[[File:MissaleLeapYear.jpg|thumb|right|In the older [[Roman Missal]], feast days falling on or after February 24 are celebrated one day later in leap year.]]\nUntil 1970, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] always celebrated the feast of [[Saint Matthias]] on a. d. VI Kal. Mart., so if the days were numbered from the beginning of the month, it was named February 24 in common years, but the presence of the bissextum in a bissextile year immediately before a. d. VI Kal. Mart. shifted the latter day to February 25 in leap years, with the [[Vigil]] of St. Matthias shifting from February 23 to the leap day of February 24. This shift did not take place in pre-Reformation Norway and Iceland; [[Pope Alexander III]] ruled that either practice was lawful ([[Liber Extra]], 5. 40. 14. 1). Other feasts normally falling on February 25\u201328 in common years are also shifted to the following day in a leap year (although they would be on the same day according to the Roman notation). The practice is still observed by those who use the older calendars.\n\n=== Synchronized calendars (Bengali, Indian and Thai) ===\nThe Revised [[Bengali Calendar]] of Bangladesh and the [[Indian National Calendar]] organise their leap years so that the every leap day is close to a February 29 in the Gregorian calendar and vice versa. This makes it easy to convert dates to or from Gregorian.\n\nThe [[Thai solar calendar]] uses the [[Buddhist Era]] (BE), but has been synchronized with the Gregorian since [[AD]] 1941.\n\n==Julian, Coptic and Ethiopian calendars==\nFrom AD 8 the Julian calendar received an extra day added to February in years that are multiples of 4.\n\nThe [[Coptic calendar]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]] also add an extra day to the end of the year once every four years before a Julian 29-day February.\n\nThis rule gives an average year length of 365.25 days. However, it is 11 minutes longer than a tropical year. This means that the vernal equinox moves a day earlier in the calendar about every 131 years.\n\n==Revised Julian calendar==\nThe [[Revised Julian calendar]] adds an extra day to February in years that are multiples of four, except for years that are multiples of 100 that do not leave a remainder of 200 or 600 when divided by 900. This rule agrees with the rule for the Gregorian calendar until 2799. The first year that dates in the Revised Julian calendar will not agree with those in the Gregorian calendar will be 2800, because it will be a leap year in the Gregorian calendar but not in the Revised Julian calendar.\n\nThis rule gives an average year length of 365.242222 days. This is a very good approximation to the ''mean'' tropical year, but because the ''vernal equinox'' year is slightly longer, the Revised Julian calendar for the time being does not do as good a job as the Gregorian calendar at keeping the vernal equinox on or close to March 21.\n\n==Chinese calendar==\nThe [[Chinese calendar]] is [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], so a leap year has an extra month, often called an ''embolismic'' month after the Greek word for it. In the Chinese calendar the [[leap month]] is added according to a rule which ensures that month 11 is always the month that contains the northern winter [[solstice]]. The intercalary month takes the same number as the preceding month; for example, if it follows the second month (\u4e8c\u6708) then it is simply called \"leap second month\" i.e. {{zh|t=\u958f\u4e8c\u6708|s=\u95f0\u4e8c\u6708|p=r\u00f9n'\u00e8ryu\u00e8}}.\n\n==Hebrew calendar==<!-- This section is linked from [[Jewish holiday]] -->\nThe Hebrew calendar is lunisolar with an [[embolismic month]]. This extra month is called ''Adar Alef'' ([[Adar 1|first Adar]]) and is added before ''[[Adar]]'', which then becomes ''Adar Bet'' ([[Adar 2|second Adar]]). According to the [[Metonic cycle]], this is done seven times every nineteen years (specifically, in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19). This is to ensure that [[Passover]] ({{transl|he|''Pesah''}}) is always in the spring as required by the [[Torah]] (Pentateuch) in many verses<ref>Exodus 23,15 ; Exodus 34,18 ; Deuteronomy 15,1 ; Deuteronomy 15, 13</ref> relating to Passover.\n\nIn addition, the Hebrew calendar has postponement rules that postpone the start of the year by one or two days. These postponement rules reduce the number of different combinations of year length and starting [[Week-day names|days of the week]] from 28 to 14, and regulate the location of certain religious holidays in relation to the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. In particular, the first day of the Hebrew year can never be Sunday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as \"{{transl|he|''lo adu rosh''}}\" ({{lang|he|\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d3\"\u05d5 \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9}}), i.e., \"Rosh [ha-Shanah, first day of the year] is not Sunday, Wednesday or Friday\" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''adu''}} is written by three [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] signifying Sunday, Wednesday and Friday). Accordingly, the first day of Passover is never Monday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as \"{{transl|he|''lo badu Pesah''}}\" ({{lang|he|\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d3\"\u05d5 \u05e4\u05e1\u05d7}}), which has a double meaning \u2014 \"Passover is not a legend\", but also \"Passover is not Monday, Wednesday or Friday\" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''badu''}} is written by three Hebrew letters signifying Monday, Wednesday and Friday).\n\nOne reason for this rule is that [[Yom Kippur]], the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar and the tenth day of the Hebrew year, now must never be adjacent to the weekly Sabbath (which is Saturday), i.e., it must never fall on Friday or Sunday, in order not to have two adjacent Sabbath days. However, Yom Kippur can still be on Saturday. A second reason is that [[Hoshana Rabbah]], the 21st day of the Hebrew year, will never be on Saturday. These rules for the Feasts do not apply to the years from the Creation to the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt under Moses. It was at that time (cf. Exodus 13) that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob gave the Hebrews their \"Law\" including the days to be kept holy and the feast days and Sabbaths.\n\nYears consisting of 12 months have between 353 and 355 days.

This phenomenon is exploited when a person claims to be only a quarter of their actual age, by counting their leap-year birthday anniversaries only: for example, in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1879 [[comic opera]] ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Frederic the pirate apprentice discovers that he is bound to serve the pirates until his 21st ''birthday'' (that is, when he turns 88 years old, since 1900 was not a leap year) rather than until his 21st ''year''.\n\nFor legal purposes, legal birthdays depend on how local laws count time intervals.\n\n===Taiwan===\n{{Wikisource|Civil Code Part I General Principles}}\nThe Civil Code of the [[Taiwan]] since October 10, 1929,<ref>{{citation | url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawHistory.aspx?PCode=B0000001 | title = Legislative History of the Civil Code of the Republic of China}}</ref> implies that the legal birthday of a leapling is February 28 in common years:\n\n{{quote|If a period fixed by weeks, months, and years does not commence from the beginning of a week, month, or year, it ends with the ending of the day which precedes the day of the last week, month, or year which corresponds to that on which it began to commence.

Throughout the summer [[Arrayer|Commissioners of Array]] for the King and [[Deputy Lieutenant]]s for Parliament attempted to raise the [[Trainband|trained bands]] and to seize the [[wiktionary:magazine|magazine]] in every county. During the confusion caused by the troops waiting to be shipped from [[Chester]] to [[Ireland]] to suppress the rebellion there, Sir William Brereton, the Parliamentary representative in Cheshire, turned to what was virtually recruiting. He found himself opposed by Sir Thomas Aston and all the resident Cheshire nobility and he failed in his attempt to secure Chester for Parliament.\n\nAt this time Aston was probably the recognized representative of the King in the county and was able to present the latter with a list of men willing to serve in the King's army. The King decided to base this army at [[Shrewsbury]] and when he arrived there on 20 September 1642 he wrote to [[Robert Needham, 2nd Viscount Kilmorey|Lord Kilmorey]], [[Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster|Lord Cholmondeley]] and \"the other of the subscribers for Horse in Cheshire\" telling them to deliver their horses into the charge of Aston who was to bring the forces raised to Shrewsbury to join with the main body of the army. Charles made it unnecessary for Aston to leave for Shrewsbury as he instead came to Chester and it was from here that he issued, on 26 September, an order for the seizure of arms and horses from those people who had carried out Parliament's [[Militia Ordinance]] in Cheshire. These were to be delivered to Aston who was able to leave with the King at the head of three troops of horse.\n\nAston obviously conducted himself satisfactorily in the campaign culminating in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] because an order from [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] in January 1643 refers to him as a colonel of a regiment of cuirassiers, and two days later on 19 January the King announced that he was sending Aston as a major-general to Cheshire and Lancashire. Aston's orders were simply stated by Prince Rupert; he was to take his regiment to Shropshire, raise forces of horse and foot there, and then defend Cheshire against the Parliamentary force that was heading to the county from London under the leadership of Brereton. He was also to seize arms and ammunition for the King's use and \"put into execution the laws and customs martial upon all offenders.....for the better preventing of disorders, plunderings and outrages which are often committed by soldiers.\" He was told to achieve this and return to the main army by 15 March unless he received orders to the contrary.\n\nThe preparations for Aston's march and arrival in Cheshire reveal the King's interest in keeping Cheshire Royalist. The authorities of the areas that Aston was to pass through on his way from [[Oxford]] to Cheshire were ordered to provide food and lodgings for his men. The Cheshire Commissioners of Array were also given explicit orders as to what they should do to help Aston. The King explained to them that, as the Parliamentarians had rejected the [[Bunbury Agreement]] and were sending a force to Cheshire, he was sending Aston and his regiment of horse to protect the county. The commissioners were to assemble the trained bands and summon [[Quarter Sessions]] to decide on a method of raising money to pay the soldiers. They were also to help Aston raise a regiment of [[dragoons]] and seize arms from \"malignants\" to arm them. In addition the parishes were to supply them horses.\n\nParliament also realised how important Cheshire was and sent Brereton to raise support for its cause.  Geographically Cheshire lies between the [[Pennines]] and the Welsh hills and so whoever controlled Cheshire controlled the north \u2013 south corridor. For Parliament the control of Cheshire would mean separating the King's northern supporters from the King and his army at Oxford. It could also stop the King bringing in reinforcements from his Irish army through the port of Chester. '<ref name=\"ives\">[http://www.brereton.org/professor_eric_ives.htm Lecture given to the worldwide Brereton Family Reunion]</ref>\n\nWhen Aston arrived in Shropshire he found that there were only 60 dragoons instead of the 600 promised. The authorities promised him another 200 and so he decided to wait for two days before moving on to Cheshire. During this time he was ordered to [[Stafford]] to help the sheriff there (perhaps against the Moorlanders who had risen for Parliament). However Aston did not neglect his prime objective and ordered the Cheshire Commissioners of Array to defend [[Nantwich]] with 150 musketeers and to inform him of Brereton's progress. Neither order was carried out and Aston was not informed until it was too late to arrive at Nantwich before Brereton.\n\n===Skirmish at Nantwich===\n[[File:Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet.jpg|right|thumb|Sir William Brereton]]\n\nBrereton, meanwhile, had ridden into [[Congleton]] on the evening of 27 January with\nhis own troop of horse and three companies of dragoons. Although he was joined in Congleton by the former mayor, William Edwards, with another troop of horse, his whole force could not have amounted to more than about 500 men. His mission, however, was not to conquer Cheshire but to rouse and organize the Parliamentary sympathizers in it. He had with him the cadre of a foot regiment, a case of drakes (small cannon about 7\u00bd feet long) and 700 muskets in his baggage train as well as an experienced Scottish professional, Major James Lothian,<ref>[http://www.scotwars.com/james_lothian.htm Major James Lothian.

He had wide powers to construct fortifications and raise more men and was to finance the whole enterprise by voluntary payment and [[wiktionary:distraint|distraint]] upon the rent and goods of local Royalists.\n\nHe approached Nantwich on 28 January. not just \"to releave the town, beinge in greate danger to be plundered and destroyed by the Kings Armye and Commissioners of Array\",<ref name=\"malbon\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027145351/http://www.geocities.com/brigaban/malbon.html Malbon\u2019s Memorials of the Civil War]</ref> but also because it offered the only alternative to Chester as a county headquarters. It had sufficient wealth and housing to accommodate a large garrison and staff and was the centre of a network of roads leading to the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[London]], to North [[Wales]], [[Lancashire]], [[Yorkshire]] and [[Scotland]].\n\nBrereton sent ahead 50 dragoons under Lothian to occupy the town and they got there before Aston who had finally been informed of Brereton's progress by [[Sir Orlando Bridgeman, 1st Baronet, of Great Lever|Orlando Bridgeman]], the son of the Bishop of Chester. Aston had with him his own troop of horse and some companies of Shropshire dragoons under the command of Colonel Sir Vincent Corbett<ref>\n[http://website.lineone.net/~corbett_group/First/People/dragoon.htm  The Corbett Study Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930032731/http://website.lineone.net/~corbett_group/First/People/dragoon.htm |date=2007-09-30 }}</ref> totalling about 500 men. Despite his superiority of numbers Aston failed to take the town and at dusk he retreated eastwards down Hospital Street. In a narrow lane his force met the remainder of Brereton's force and confusion was the result. A company of Brereton's dragoons dismounted but failed to leave anyone to control the horses which bolted into the fields and were taken by the Royalists for charging cavalry. The confusion was added to when some Parliamentarians loaded and fired one of the drakes. This does not seem to have caused any injury but the flash and the roar amid the general confusion frightened the Royalists so much \"that they weire all scattered and quyte Rowted\".<ref name=\"malbon\"/>\n\nAston turned up eventually at [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] and, although he claimed the skirmish as a draw, his distance from Nantwich and his appeals for reinforcements indicates that the skirmish was a defeat for the Royalists, likely due to his men being exhausted after the long march from Oxford and that he did not receive the support from the Cheshire Commissioners of Array that he had expected. This lack of proper support continued over the next four or five weeks. An agreement was made to raise a contribution in the county to pay the soldiers but most was paid to the upkeep of the Chester garrison, not to Aston's regiment or to the trained bands. The Royalist leaders were never able to agree to a unified command which meant that they were never able to field an army that would outnumber Brereton's force. There was a force of 2,000 men at Warrington under the Earl of Derby, a Welsh force of 1,000 men at Chester and the Shropshire force at Whitchurch. These never combined and it was not until March that the Royalists decided to choose a place in the county \"to summon in the King's friends\"\n\n==Prelude==\nAston set out for Middlewich on Friday 10 March. His progress was delayed that night when his men, who had yet to be paid, mutinied. Apparently the money and provisions were issued on Saturday but it was so late that Aston had to leave two troops of horse in the forest to guard it - \"though they lay in danger that night.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\">Sir Thomas Aston's Account to the Commissioners of Array for the County of Chester. Document XVII in J. R. Phillips, Memoirs of The Civil Wars in Wales and the Marches, Vol 2, pp 56 \u2013 61 (London, 1874)</ref> It is not known why Middlewich was chosen as opposed to the much safer [[Knutsford]] where it would have been possible to retreat to [[Warrington]] if necessary. In his account of the battle of Middlewich, Aston did not say why he came to Middlewich on 11 March but explained that he had no wish to linger there. He realized the dangers of staying in an open town with enemy forces at both [[Northwich]] and Nantwich. Brereton, who was recruiting in Northwich, commented on the boldness of the Royalists for camping at Middlewich. He believed it resulted from overconfidence in their ability to win over the county and rid it of the Parliamentarians.\n\n==Saturday 11 March==\nAston arrived at Middlewich with about 500 mounted troops and over 1000 of the trained bands of the [[Broxton (hundred)|Broxton]] and [[Hundred of Wirral|Wirral]] [[Hundred (division)|Hundred]]s plus three cannons. William Brereton sent a strong party of horse from Northwich \"who gave them an alarm.\" Aston had meanwhile received a letter from the Governor of Chester, Sir Nicolas Byron,<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=19198 A History of the County of Chester: Volume 5 (i)]</ref> telling him that if he provided an escort for the family and goods of [[William Brereton, 2nd Baron Brereton|Lord Brereton]] to Chester then the latter, who was a relative of Sir William Brereton, would provide men for Aston. Although reluctant to linger in Middlewich, Thomas, after consulting with the sheriff, Sir [[Edward Fytton]] and Colonel Ellis, decided it was worth waiting for another day. He therefore sent a letter to Lord Brereton urging him to act immediately even though it meant travelling on a Sunday.\n\n==Sunday 12 March==\nBrereton, wanting to \"annoy\" the enemy, set out with two or three companies of dragoons to give alarm at Middlewich. He had no intention of attacking but wanted to harass the Royalists. In the meantime Lord Brereton had not done as Aston requested but instead came to Middlewich to confer further. Thomas believed that Lord Brereton's presence in Middlewich led to the attack by the Parliamentarians because they wanted to prevent the Royalists from joining forces. Sir William Brereton however, in his account of the battle, made it clear that he attacked because he believed a Royalist presence in Middlewich posed too much of a threat to be ignored.\n\nIn order to confer with Lord Brereton and also the sheriff's desire to \"sumon the countrey with theire contribucon and assistance, necessitated a ioynt consent to stay there on Monday.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\"/>  Realising the danger posed by this decision Aston asked that the governor use the Whitchurch forces to threaten the Parliamentarians at Nantwich. According to the Commissioners of Array the Whitchurch force was not ordered to threaten Nantwich. In any case the forces there had been disbanded. Aston's fears were well founded as Brereton arranged to meet the Nantwich forces at six o'clock the next morning and to make a joint attack on Middlewich.\n\n==Battle==\nOn the morning of Monday 13 March the Nantwich forces had not arrived at the appointed time so Brereton decided to attack with his cavalry and about 200 musketeers (\"our greatest force of foot being at Nantwich\"). He \"with the best forces hee had theire came early in the mornynge backe to Midlewiche, & vpon Sheathe Heathe att the west end of the said Towne, Sr Thomas Aston havinge taken the advantage of the said ground & wynde, & planted his ordnance, sett upon him\"<ref name=\"malbon\"/>  Thomas sent a party of dragoons and horse under Captain Spotswood to give an alarm at Northwich, presumably to draw off some of Brereton's force. The captain, however, disobeyed orders and engaged the enemy and as a result Brereton's forces were able to establish themselves in one street leading into the town. In another street Captain Prestwich and his men were caught unawares by the enemy but were able to rally and drive back the enemy horse and rescue some prisoners. He stopped at a bridge and managed to hold off the enemy until the foot soldiers arrived. Waring Bridge was also approached by the enemy so Aston sent Prestwich and his troop to aid Captain Massie's company of foot defend it. In this way Aston was able to hold off the enemy until about 9:00 or 10:00&nbsp;a.m. when the Nantwich force arrived \"so resolutely and with such undauntedness of spirit.\" About 800 foot and 300 horse came down Booth Lane and entered into Newton at the south end of the town, where Aston had placed \"a good Brasse peece of ordnance\" and two trained bands of 200 men who were \"well advantaged by ditches and bankes on both sides.\" Aston withdrew a troop of horse under the command of Captain Bridgeman from the Northwich approach to check the advance of the Nantwich force. The rest of his horse he held back behind the foot, \"there being noe other ground for horse\", apart from a force of about 60 to attack the enemy. His plan was to line the hedge with about 100 musketeers so that the enemy could not take advantage of the ditches on both sides of the lane to attack the charging horse.\n\nThe Parliamentary force, on finding the lane so well defended, took to the fields on either side of the lane. The Royalist horse could not charge because of the hedges and the musketeers deserted as soon as the first shots were fired at them. The horse was therefore outflanked and cut off by the enemy musketeers on both sides of the lane. On the west side of the town the troop of horse, under Mayor Thomas Holme, were managing to hold off the Parliamentarians despite the fact that Bridgeman's troop had been withdrawn to defend the southern entrance. However, when Sergeant Major Gilmore ordered his foot to retreat the horse were outflanked by enemy musketeers on either side of the lane behind the hedges where the horse could not charge. They were therefore forced back into the town. The street was defended by musketeers behind a breastwork but they ran away after blindly firing once. Similarly the foot soldiers guarding Waring Bridge were ordered to retreat and the Parliamentarians were able to enter the town from there. Meanwhile, the horse on the Nantwich approach were pulled back to allow the use of the cannon that Ellis had drawn up.\n\nThe Parliamentarians were advancing towards [[St. Michael and All Angels, Middlewich|St Michael and All Angels church]] from three directions so Aston ordered a party of Captain Spotswood's dragoons to secure and defend the churchyard. He also placed a guard at the breastworks on the west side of town and put a cannon in the churchyard to cover the street. A company of musketeers and two trained bands were brought up to hold off the advancing Nantwich force. These musketeers lay down in the ditches as soon as they came to Ellis's cannon and it was all Aston could do to get them up to the hedges with the other musketeers by riding among them \"and with my sword I beat them up.\" This served no purpose because the soldiers would not lift their heads to see where to fire but instead shot their muskets into the air.\n\nThe Parliamentarians meanwhile had become encouraged by the inaccurate fire of the cannon and they charged the Royalist foot who promptly ran away, leaving Aston's cavalry exposed and unable to charge because of a large ditch. They therefore drew off to a safer position. Seeing this, a body of pikemen behind a breastwork further back ran away and \"all the musqueteers placed for the defence of the street ende quit their trenches, having never seen the enemy or cause of feare, but their fellows flying.\" Aston, however, held his cavalry firm until Ellis could draw off his cannon and then ordered a retreat to the high street. Aston himself went to the churchyard expecting it to be defended as he had ordered. Instead he found all the foot soldiers in the church and he could not \"draw out ten musqueteers out of the church would it have saved the world.\"  Relying on his two cannon to cover two streets, Aston ordered his cavalry, being exposed to the advancing enemy on three sides, to regroup in a field at one end of the town. However, their way was blocked by a barricade erected by Spotswood and they became separated and were unable to regroup until they were well past Kinderton House.\n\nReturning to the cannon Aston found that one had been deserted and the other being drawn off by a solitary cannoneer. With all the other men, including Ellis, in the church and refusing to come out, Aston was now alone:\n<blockquote>\n\"The enimy falling directly in three streets upon me, and discharging upon me in the church-yard, the horse marched out of sight. I alone, all I could possibly hope to doe was to rally the horse again if possible, to wheel about, and to fall in the rear of them\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the maze of streets Aston lost contact with his cavalry, apart from a few stragglers, and had little hope of turning the disaster into success especially as the Parliamentarians had now taken the church. With it they captured Ellis, Gilmore, Moseley, ten captains and other officers, 400 common soldiers, weapons for 500 men, two barrels of matches, four barrels of powder and two cannons.  Brereton, therefore, believed that \"since the beginning of this unnatural war, God hath not given many more complete victories.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsBrereton\">Battle of Middlewich, March 13, 1643 - Sir William Brereton's Account. Document XVI in J. R. Phillips, Memoirs of The Civil Wars in Wales and the Marches, Vol 2, pp 54 \u2013 55 (London, 1874)</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Sir Thomas Aston===\nAston sent a messenger to rally his cavalry at [[Northwich|Rudheath]] intending to go on to [[Brereton, Cheshire|Lord Brereton]] and collect his force. The cavalry were, however, beyond recall and so Aston went on his own to give an account of the battle and to see if Lord Brereton was still willing to support him. Finding that he was, Aston returned to Whitchurch to raise the Shropshire forces. However, the trained bands there had been disbanded leaving him no alternative but to return to Cheshire, rally his men and await his fate. He summed up his feelings about the battle thus:\n<blockquote>\n\"It is the plain truth, the enemy having no diversion, but att liberty with their full power to fall on us from all parts, were much too hard for us in a place not defensible. And without some more experienced foot officers, I must freely say no number will be found sufficient to withstand ready men.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\"/>\n</blockquote>\nHe was withdrawn to Oxford and continued to command a cavalry regiment in the King's field army. In 1644 he fought as a brigadier of cavalry in [[Prince Maurice von Simmern|Prince Maurice's]] army in the West of England and fought at the [[second Battle of Newbury]] but probably never returned to Cheshire (although at least two sources mention him being there in 1644).<ref>[http://www.pardoes.com/abo/history.htm Welcome to Acton Bridge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016154440/http://www.pardoes.com/abo/history.htm |date=16 October 2006 }} states that during the Civil War in 1644 Sir Thomas Aston's men exercised \"all manor of outrages and intollerable taxes. They plundered Weaverham and the country about, carried off old men out of their houses, bound them together, tyde them to a cart and rove them through mire and water to that dungeon, where they lie without fire or light and now through extremities are so diseased, they are ready to give up the ghost.\" but does not state the source of the quote. Also John Vicars (see Online Sources below) stated that Brereton during the siege of Nantwich in 1644 \"won a most famous Victory of the Lord Capell and the Lord Byron.....and Sir Thomas Aston also\"</ref>\n\nIn 1645 Aston served in the West Country under [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] until September or October when he decided to return home. He passed through [[Kidderminster]] and [[Stourbridge]] on his way to Cheshire. At the beginning of November he was captured by a Parliamentary force under the command of a certain Captain Stones \"att or neere Banke\" (possibly near [[Walsall]]) along with about 60 Royalists - presumably Cheshire men who had fought in Aston's regiment and who were also returning home. From there he was taken to prison and placed under arrest. On 24 March 1646 Aston died of a fever brought on by his various wounds, including a blow to the head received during an unsuccessful attempt to escape.\n\n===Sir William Brereton===\nBrereton declared God responsible for him winning the battle:\n<blockquote>\n\"I desire the whole praise and glory may be attributed to Almighty God, who infused courage into them that stood for His cause, and struck the enemy with terror and amazement.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsBrereton\"/>\n</blockquote>\nBy the end of the spring Parliamentary forces, with Brereton as commander-in-chief, controlled five of the seven Hundreds of Cheshire. From this time on through to February 1646, when the last remaining Royalist base at Chester surrendered to him, the county was dominated by Berenton and he proved to be a dynamic war-time leader not just militarily but also politically and administratively. According to professor Ives, because of the importance of Cheshire, Brereton  \"had more influence on the outcome of the First English Civil War than Oliver Cromwell had.\"<ref name=\"ives\"/>  He suffered his only major defeat in December 1643 at [[Second Battle of Middlewich|Middlewich]]. In 1646, when peace returned and his control over Cheshire came to an end, Brereton moved south to become an active London-based MP and politician. As a reward for his services he received the chief forestership of the Forest of Macclesfield and the [[wiktionary:seneschal|seneschalship]] of the Hundred of Macclesfield. In 1651 he received the tenancy of the former archbishop's palace at [[Croydon]] in [[Surrey]] and he spent the last nine years of his life commuting between there and his ancestral home at [[Handforth]], in Cheshire. He died on 7 April 1661 in [[Croydon]] and is presumed to have been buried in the family vault in the church at [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] in Cheshire.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*R.

Throughout the summer [[Arrayer|Commissioners of Array]] for the King and [[Deputy Lieutenant]]s for Parliament attempted to raise the [[Trainband|trained bands]] and to seize the [[wiktionary:magazine|magazine]] in every county. During the confusion caused by the troops waiting to be shipped from [[Chester]] to [[Ireland]] to suppress the rebellion there, Sir William Brereton, the Parliamentary representative in Cheshire, turned to what was virtually recruiting. He found himself opposed by Sir Thomas Aston and all the resident Cheshire nobility and he failed in his attempt to secure Chester for Parliament.\n\nAt this time Aston was probably the recognized representative of the King in the county and was able to present the latter with a list of men willing to serve in the King's army. The King decided to base this army at [[Shrewsbury]] and when he arrived there on 20 September 1642 he wrote to [[Robert Needham, 2nd Viscount Kilmorey|Lord Kilmorey]], [[Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster|Lord Cholmondeley]] and \"the other of the subscribers for Horse in Cheshire\" telling them to deliver their horses into the charge of Aston who was to bring the forces raised to Shrewsbury to join with the main body of the army. Charles made it unnecessary for Aston to leave for Shrewsbury as he instead came to Chester and it was from here that he issued, on 26 September, an order for the seizure of arms and horses from those people who had carried out Parliament's [[Militia Ordinance]] in Cheshire. These were to be delivered to Aston who was able to leave with the King at the head of three troops of horse.\n\nAston obviously conducted himself satisfactorily in the campaign culminating in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] because an order from [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] in January 1643 refers to him as a colonel of a regiment of cuirassiers, and two days later on 19 January the King announced that he was sending Aston as a major-general to Cheshire and Lancashire. Aston's orders were simply stated by Prince Rupert; he was to take his regiment to Shropshire, raise forces of horse and foot there, and then defend Cheshire against the Parliamentary force that was heading to the county from London under the leadership of Brereton. He was also to seize arms and ammunition for the King's use and \"put into execution the laws and customs martial upon all offenders.....for the better preventing of disorders, plunderings and outrages which are often committed by soldiers.\" He was told to achieve this and return to the main army by 15 March unless he received orders to the contrary.\n\nThe preparations for Aston's march and arrival in Cheshire reveal the King's interest in keeping Cheshire Royalist. The authorities of the areas that Aston was to pass through on his way from [[Oxford]] to Cheshire were ordered to provide food and lodgings for his men. The Cheshire Commissioners of Array were also given explicit orders as to what they should do to help Aston. The King explained to them that, as the Parliamentarians had rejected the [[Bunbury Agreement]] and were sending a force to Cheshire, he was sending Aston and his regiment of horse to protect the county. The commissioners were to assemble the trained bands and summon [[Quarter Sessions]] to decide on a method of raising money to pay the soldiers. They were also to help Aston raise a regiment of [[dragoons]] and seize arms from \"malignants\" to arm them. In addition the parishes were to supply them horses.\n\nParliament also realised how important Cheshire was and sent Brereton to raise support for its cause.  Geographically Cheshire lies between the [[Pennines]] and the Welsh hills and so whoever controlled Cheshire controlled the north \u2013 south corridor. For Parliament the control of Cheshire would mean separating the King's northern supporters from the King and his army at Oxford. It could also stop the King bringing in reinforcements from his Irish army through the port of Chester. '<ref name=\"ives\">[http://www.brereton.org/professor_eric_ives.htm Lecture given to the worldwide Brereton Family Reunion]</ref>\n\nWhen Aston arrived in Shropshire he found that there were only 60 dragoons instead of the 600 promised. The authorities promised him another 200 and so he decided to wait for two days before moving on to Cheshire. During this time he was ordered to [[Stafford]] to help the sheriff there (perhaps against the Moorlanders who had risen for Parliament). However Aston did not neglect his prime objective and ordered the Cheshire Commissioners of Array to defend [[Nantwich]] with 150 musketeers and to inform him of Brereton's progress. Neither order was carried out and Aston was not informed until it was too late to arrive at Nantwich before Brereton.\n\n===Skirmish at Nantwich===\n[[File:Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet.jpg|right|thumb|Sir William Brereton]]\n\nBrereton, meanwhile, had ridden into [[Congleton]] on the evening of 27 January with\nhis own troop of horse and three companies of dragoons. Although he was joined in Congleton by the former mayor, William Edwards, with another troop of horse, his whole force could not have amounted to more than about 500 men. His mission, however, was not to conquer Cheshire but to rouse and organize the Parliamentary sympathizers in it. He had with him the cadre of a foot regiment, a case of drakes (small cannon about 7\u00bd feet long) and 700 muskets in his baggage train as well as an experienced Scottish professional, Major James Lothian,<ref>[http://www.scotwars.com/james_lothian.htm Major James Lothian. A short history of a Scots professional soldier in Cheshire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927101159/http://www.scotwars.com/james_lothian.htm |date=2011-09-27 }}</ref> to train recruits. He had wide powers to construct fortifications and raise more men and was to finance the whole enterprise by voluntary payment and [[wiktionary:distraint|distraint]] upon the rent and goods of local Royalists.\n\nHe approached Nantwich on 28 January. not just \"to releave the town, beinge in greate danger to be plundered and destroyed by the Kings Armye and Commissioners of Array\",<ref name=\"malbon\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027145351/http://www.geocities.com/brigaban/malbon.html Malbon\u2019s Memorials of the Civil War]</ref> but also because it offered the only alternative to Chester as a county headquarters. It had sufficient wealth and housing to accommodate a large garrison and staff and was the centre of a network of roads leading to the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[London]], to North [[Wales]], [[Lancashire]], [[Yorkshire]] and [[Scotland]].\n\nBrereton sent ahead 50 dragoons under Lothian to occupy the town and they got there before Aston who had finally been informed of Brereton's progress by [[Sir Orlando Bridgeman, 1st Baronet, of Great Lever|Orlando Bridgeman]], the son of the Bishop of Chester. Aston had with him his own troop of horse and some companies of Shropshire dragoons under the command of Colonel Sir Vincent Corbett<ref>\n[http://website.lineone.net/~corbett_group/First/People/dragoon.htm  The Corbett Study Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930032731/http://website.lineone.net/~corbett_group/First/People/dragoon.htm |date=2007-09-30 }}</ref> totalling about 500 men. Despite his superiority of numbers Aston failed to take the town and at dusk he retreated eastwards down Hospital Street. In a narrow lane his force met the remainder of Brereton's force and confusion was the result. A company of Brereton's dragoons dismounted but failed to leave anyone to control the horses which bolted into the fields and were taken by the Royalists for charging cavalry. The confusion was added to when some Parliamentarians loaded and fired one of the drakes. This does not seem to have caused any injury but the flash and the roar amid the general confusion frightened the Royalists so much \"that they weire all scattered and quyte Rowted\".<ref name=\"malbon\"/>\n\nAston turned up eventually at [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] and, although he claimed the skirmish as a draw, his distance from Nantwich and his appeals for reinforcements indicates that the skirmish was a defeat for the Royalists, likely due to his men being exhausted after the long march from Oxford and that he did not receive the support from the Cheshire Commissioners of Array that he had expected. This lack of proper support continued over the next four or five weeks. An agreement was made to raise a contribution in the county to pay the soldiers but most was paid to the upkeep of the Chester garrison, not to Aston's regiment or to the trained bands. The Royalist leaders were never able to agree to a unified command which meant that they were never able to field an army that would outnumber Brereton's force. There was a force of 2,000 men at Warrington under the Earl of Derby, a Welsh force of 1,000 men at Chester and the Shropshire force at Whitchurch. These never combined and it was not until March that the Royalists decided to choose a place in the county \"to summon in the King's friends\"\n\n==Prelude==\nAston set out for Middlewich on Friday 10 March. His progress was delayed that night when his men, who had yet to be paid, mutinied. Apparently the money and provisions were issued on Saturday but it was so late that Aston had to leave two troops of horse in the forest to guard it - \"though they lay in danger that night.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\">Sir Thomas Aston's Account to the Commissioners of Array for the County of Chester. Document XVII in J. R. Phillips, Memoirs of The Civil Wars in Wales and the Marches, Vol 2, pp 56 \u2013 61 (London, 1874)</ref> It is not known why Middlewich was chosen as opposed to the much safer [[Knutsford]] where it would have been possible to retreat to [[Warrington]] if necessary. In his account of the battle of Middlewich, Aston did not say why he came to Middlewich on 11 March but explained that he had no wish to linger there. He realized the dangers of staying in an open town with enemy forces at both [[Northwich]] and Nantwich. Brereton, who was recruiting in Northwich, commented on the boldness of the Royalists for camping at Middlewich. He believed it resulted from overconfidence in their ability to win over the county and rid it of the Parliamentarians.\n\n==Saturday 11 March==\nAston arrived at Middlewich with about 500 mounted troops and over 1000 of the trained bands of the [[Broxton (hundred)|Broxton]] and [[Hundred of Wirral|Wirral]] [[Hundred (division)|Hundred]]s plus three cannons. William Brereton sent a strong party of horse from Northwich \"who gave them an alarm.\" Aston had meanwhile received a letter from the Governor of Chester, Sir Nicolas Byron,<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=19198 A History of the County of Chester: Volume 5 (i)]</ref> telling him that if he provided an escort for the family and goods of [[William Brereton, 2nd Baron Brereton|Lord Brereton]] to Chester then the latter, who was a relative of Sir William Brereton, would provide men for Aston. Although reluctant to linger in Middlewich, Thomas, after consulting with the sheriff, Sir [[Edward Fytton]] and Colonel Ellis, decided it was worth waiting for another day. He therefore sent a letter to Lord Brereton urging him to act immediately even though it meant travelling on a Sunday.\n\n==Sunday 12 March==\nBrereton, wanting to \"annoy\" the enemy, set out with two or three companies of dragoons to give alarm at Middlewich. He had no intention of attacking but wanted to harass the Royalists. In the meantime Lord Brereton had not done as Aston requested but instead came to Middlewich to confer further. Thomas believed that Lord Brereton's presence in Middlewich led to the attack by the Parliamentarians because they wanted to prevent the Royalists from joining forces. Sir William Brereton however, in his account of the battle, made it clear that he attacked because he believed a Royalist presence in Middlewich posed too much of a threat to be ignored.\n\nIn order to confer with Lord Brereton and also the sheriff's desire to \"sumon the countrey with theire contribucon and assistance, necessitated a ioynt consent to stay there on Monday.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\"/>  Realising the danger posed by this decision Aston asked that the governor use the Whitchurch forces to threaten the Parliamentarians at Nantwich. According to the Commissioners of Array the Whitchurch force was not ordered to threaten Nantwich. In any case the forces there had been disbanded. Aston's fears were well founded as Brereton arranged to meet the Nantwich forces at six o'clock the next morning and to make a joint attack on Middlewich.\n\n==Battle==\nOn the morning of Monday 13 March the Nantwich forces had not arrived at the appointed time so Brereton decided to attack with his cavalry and about 200 musketeers (\"our greatest force of foot being at Nantwich\"). He \"with the best forces hee had theire came early in the mornynge backe to Midlewiche, & vpon Sheathe Heathe att the west end of the said Towne, Sr Thomas Aston havinge taken the advantage of the said ground & wynde, & planted his ordnance, sett upon him\"<ref name=\"malbon\"/>  Thomas sent a party of dragoons and horse under Captain Spotswood to give an alarm at Northwich, presumably to draw off some of Brereton's force. The captain, however, disobeyed orders and engaged the enemy and as a result Brereton's forces were able to establish themselves in one street leading into the town. In another street Captain Prestwich and his men were caught unawares by the enemy but were able to rally and drive back the enemy horse and rescue some prisoners. He stopped at a bridge and managed to hold off the enemy until the foot soldiers arrived. Waring Bridge was also approached by the enemy so Aston sent Prestwich and his troop to aid Captain Massie's company of foot defend it. In this way Aston was able to hold off the enemy until about 9:00 or 10:00&nbsp;a.m. when the Nantwich force arrived \"so resolutely and with such undauntedness of spirit.\" About 800 foot and 300 horse came down Booth Lane and entered into Newton at the south end of the town, where Aston had placed \"a good Brasse peece of ordnance\" and two trained bands of 200 men who were \"well advantaged by ditches and bankes on both sides.\" Aston withdrew a troop of horse under the command of Captain Bridgeman from the Northwich approach to check the advance of the Nantwich force. The rest of his horse he held back behind the foot, \"there being noe other ground for horse\", apart from a force of about 60 to attack the enemy. His plan was to line the hedge with about 100 musketeers so that the enemy could not take advantage of the ditches on both sides of the lane to attack the charging horse.\n\nThe Parliamentary force, on finding the lane so well defended, took to the fields on either side of the lane. The Royalist horse could not charge because of the hedges and the musketeers deserted as soon as the first shots were fired at them. The horse was therefore outflanked and cut off by the enemy musketeers on both sides of the lane. On the west side of the town the troop of horse, under Mayor Thomas Holme, were managing to hold off the Parliamentarians despite the fact that Bridgeman's troop had been withdrawn to defend the southern entrance. However, when Sergeant Major Gilmore ordered his foot to retreat the horse were outflanked by enemy musketeers on either side of the lane behind the hedges where the horse could not charge. They were therefore forced back into the town. The street was defended by musketeers behind a breastwork but they ran away after blindly firing once. Similarly the foot soldiers guarding Waring Bridge were ordered to retreat and the Parliamentarians were able to enter the town from there. Meanwhile, the horse on the Nantwich approach were pulled back to allow the use of the cannon that Ellis had drawn up.\n\nThe Parliamentarians were advancing towards [[St. Michael and All Angels, Middlewich|St Michael and All Angels church]] from three directions so Aston ordered a party of Captain Spotswood's dragoons to secure and defend the churchyard. He also placed a guard at the breastworks on the west side of town and put a cannon in the churchyard to cover the street. A company of musketeers and two trained bands were brought up to hold off the advancing Nantwich force. These musketeers lay down in the ditches as soon as they came to Ellis's cannon and it was all Aston could do to get them up to the hedges with the other musketeers by riding among them \"and with my sword I beat them up.\" This served no purpose because the soldiers would not lift their heads to see where to fire but instead shot their muskets into the air.\n\nThe Parliamentarians meanwhile had become encouraged by the inaccurate fire of the cannon and they charged the Royalist foot who promptly ran away, leaving Aston's cavalry exposed and unable to charge because of a large ditch. They therefore drew off to a safer position. Seeing this, a body of pikemen behind a breastwork further back ran away and \"all the musqueteers placed for the defence of the street ende quit their trenches, having never seen the enemy or cause of feare, but their fellows flying.\" Aston, however, held his cavalry firm until Ellis could draw off his cannon and then ordered a retreat to the high street. Aston himself went to the churchyard expecting it to be defended as he had ordered. Instead he found all the foot soldiers in the church and he could not \"draw out ten musqueteers out of the church would it have saved the world.\"  Relying on his two cannon to cover two streets, Aston ordered his cavalry, being exposed to the advancing enemy on three sides, to regroup in a field at one end of the town. However, their way was blocked by a barricade erected by Spotswood and they became separated and were unable to regroup until they were well past Kinderton House.\n\nReturning to the cannon Aston found that one had been deserted and the other being drawn off by a solitary cannoneer. With all the other men, including Ellis, in the church and refusing to come out, Aston was now alone:\n<blockquote>\n\"The enimy falling directly in three streets upon me, and discharging upon me in the church-yard, the horse marched out of sight. I alone, all I could possibly hope to doe was to rally the horse again if possible, to wheel about, and to fall in the rear of them\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the maze of streets Aston lost contact with his cavalry, apart from a few stragglers, and had little hope of turning the disaster into success especially as the Parliamentarians had now taken the church. With it they captured Ellis, Gilmore, Moseley, ten captains and other officers, 400 common soldiers, weapons for 500 men, two barrels of matches, four barrels of powder and two cannons.  Brereton, therefore, believed that \"since the beginning of this unnatural war, God hath not given many more complete victories.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsBrereton\">Battle of Middlewich, March 13, 1643 - Sir William Brereton's Account. Document XVI in J. R. Phillips, Memoirs of The Civil Wars in Wales and the Marches, Vol 2, pp 54 \u2013 55 (London, 1874)</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Sir Thomas Aston===\nAston sent a messenger to rally his cavalry at [[Northwich|Rudheath]] intending to go on to [[Brereton, Cheshire|Lord Brereton]] and collect his force. The cavalry were, however, beyond recall and so Aston went on his own to give an account of the battle and to see if Lord Brereton was still willing to support him. Finding that he was, Aston returned to Whitchurch to raise the Shropshire forces. However, the trained bands there had been disbanded leaving him no alternative but to return to Cheshire, rally his men and await his fate. He summed up his feelings about the battle thus:\n<blockquote>\n\"It is the plain truth, the enemy having no diversion, but att liberty with their full power to fall on us from all parts, were much too hard for us in a place not defensible. And without some more experienced foot officers, I must freely say no number will be found sufficient to withstand ready men.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsAston\"/>\n</blockquote>\nHe was withdrawn to Oxford and continued to command a cavalry regiment in the King's field army. In 1644 he fought as a brigadier of cavalry in [[Prince Maurice von Simmern|Prince Maurice's]] army in the West of England and fought at the [[second Battle of Newbury]] but probably never returned to Cheshire (although at least two sources mention him being there in 1644).<ref>[http://www.pardoes.com/abo/history.htm Welcome to Acton Bridge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016154440/http://www.pardoes.com/abo/history.htm |date=16 October 2006 }} states that during the Civil War in 1644 Sir Thomas Aston's men exercised \"all manor of outrages and intollerable taxes. They plundered Weaverham and the country about, carried off old men out of their houses, bound them together, tyde them to a cart and rove them through mire and water to that dungeon, where they lie without fire or light and now through extremities are so diseased, they are ready to give up the ghost.\" but does not state the source of the quote. Also John Vicars (see Online Sources below) stated that Brereton during the siege of Nantwich in 1644 \"won a most famous Victory of the Lord Capell and the Lord Byron.....and Sir Thomas Aston also\"</ref>\n\nIn 1645 Aston served in the West Country under [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] until September or October when he decided to return home. He passed through [[Kidderminster]] and [[Stourbridge]] on his way to Cheshire. At the beginning of November he was captured by a Parliamentary force under the command of a certain Captain Stones \"att or neere Banke\" (possibly near [[Walsall]]) along with about 60 Royalists - presumably Cheshire men who had fought in Aston's regiment and who were also returning home. From there he was taken to prison and placed under arrest. On 24 March 1646 Aston died of a fever brought on by his various wounds, including a blow to the head received during an unsuccessful attempt to escape.\n\n===Sir William Brereton===\nBrereton declared God responsible for him winning the battle:\n<blockquote>\n\"I desire the whole praise and glory may be attributed to Almighty God, who infused courage into them that stood for His cause, and struck the enemy with terror and amazement.\"<ref name=\"PhillipsBrereton\"/>\n</blockquote>\nBy the end of the spring Parliamentary forces, with Brereton as commander-in-chief, controlled five of the seven Hundreds of Cheshire. From this time on through to February 1646, when the last remaining Royalist base at Chester surrendered to him, the county was dominated by Berenton and he proved to be a dynamic war-time leader not just militarily but also politically and administratively. According to professor Ives, because of the importance of Cheshire, Brereton  \"had more influence on the outcome of the First English Civil War than Oliver Cromwell had.\"<ref name=\"ives\"/>  He suffered his only major defeat in December 1643 at [[Second Battle of Middlewich|Middlewich]]. In 1646, when peace returned and his control over Cheshire came to an end, Brereton moved south to become an active London-based MP and politician. As a reward for his services he received the chief forestership of the Forest of Macclesfield and the [[wiktionary:seneschal|seneschalship]] of the Hundred of Macclesfield. In 1651 he received the tenancy of the former archbishop's palace at [[Croydon]] in [[Surrey]] and he spent the last nine years of his life commuting between there and his ancestral home at [[Handforth]], in Cheshire. He died on 7 April 1661 in [[Croydon]] and is presumed to have been buried in the family vault in the church at [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] in Cheshire.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*R.

Note that this example does not have all the children alphabetically sorted from left to right as it should be (the root and node 't').]]\n\nIn [[computer science]], a '''trie''', also called '''digital tree''' or '''prefix tree''', is a kind of [[search tree]]\u2014an ordered [[tree (data structure)|tree]] [[data structure]] used to store a [[set (abstract data type)|dynamic set]] or [[associative array]] where the keys are usually [[string (computer science)|string]]s. Unlike a [[binary search tree]], no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated; i.e., the value of the key is distributed across the structure. All the descendants of a node have a common [[prefix]] of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the [[empty string]]. Keys tend to be associated with leaves, though some inner nodes may correspond to keys of interest. Hence, keys are not necessarily associated with every node. For the space-optimized presentation of prefix tree, see [[compact prefix tree]].\n\nIn the example shown, keys are listed in the nodes and values below them. Each complete English word has an arbitrary integer value associated with it. A trie can be seen as a tree-shaped [[deterministic finite automaton]]. Each [[finite language]] is generated by a trie automaton, and each trie can be compressed into a [[deterministic acyclic finite state automaton]].\n\nThough tries can be keyed by character strings, they need not be. The same algorithms can be adapted to serve similar functions on ordered lists of any construct; e.g., permutations on a list of digits or shapes. In particular, a '''bitwise trie''' is keyed on the individual bits making up any fixed-length binary datum, such as an integer or memory address.\n\n==History and etymology==\nTries were first described by Ren\u00e9 de la Briandais in 1959.<ref>{{cite conference |first=Ren\u00e9 |last=de la Briandais |year=1959 |title=File searching using variable length keys |conference=Proc.

An imperfect hash table can have key collisions. A key collision is the hash function mapping of different keys to the same position in a hash table. The worst-case lookup speed in an imperfect hash table is [[Hash table#Chaining|O(N)]] time, but far more typically is O(1), with O(m) time spent evaluating the hash.\n* There are no collisions of different keys in a trie.\n* Buckets in a trie, which are analogous to hash table buckets that store key collisions, are necessary only if a single key is associated with more than one value.\n* There is no need to provide a hash function or to change hash functions as more keys are added to a trie.\n* A trie can provide an alphabetical ordering of the entries by key.\n\nHowever, a trie also has some drawbacks compared to a hash table:\n\n* Trie lookup can be slower than hash table lookup, especially if the data is directly accessed on a hard disk drive or some other secondary storage device where the random-access time is high compared to main memory.<ref name=\"triememory\">{{cite journal | author=Edward Fredkin| authorlink=Edward Fredkin| title=Trie Memory| journal=Communications of the ACM| year=1960| volume=3| issue=9| pages=490\u2013499| doi=10.1145/367390.367400 }}</ref>\n* Some keys, such as floating point numbers, can lead to long chains and prefixes that are not particularly meaningful. Nevertheless, a bitwise trie can handle standard IEEE single and double format floating point numbers.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n* Some tries can require more space than a hash table, as memory may be allocated for each character in the search string, rather than a single chunk of memory for the whole entry, as in most hash tables.\n\n=== Dictionary representation ===\nA common application of a trie is storing a [[predictive text]] or [[autocomplete]] dictionary, such as found on a [[mobile telephone]]. Such applications take advantage of a trie's ability to quickly search for, insert, and delete entries; however, if storing dictionary words is all that is required (i.e., storage of information auxiliary to each word is not required), a minimal [[deterministic acyclic finite state automaton]] (DAFSA) would use less space than a trie. This is because a DAFSA can compress identical branches from the trie which correspond to the same suffixes (or parts) of different words being stored.\n\nTries are also well suited for implementing approximate matching algorithms,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Aho | first1 = Alfred V. | last2 = Corasick | first2 = Margaret J. | date = Jun 1975 | title = Efficient String Matching: An Aid to Bibliographic Search | journal = [[Communications of the ACM]] | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 333\u2013340 | jstor =  | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3547/ac839d02f6efe3f6f76a8289738a22528442.pdf | format =  | accessdate = | doi=10.1145/360825.360855}}</ref> including those used in [[spell checking]] and [[Hyphenation algorithm|hyphenation]]<ref name=\"Liang1983\"/> software.\n\n=== Term indexing ===\n\nA [[discrimination tree]] [[term indexing|term index]] stores its information in a trie data structure.<ref>\nJohn W.

Find returns the value for a key string, and Insert inserts a string (the key) and a value into the trie. Both Insert and Find run in {{math|{{math|O(''m'')}}}} time, where m is the length of the key.\n\nA simple Node class can be used to represent nodes in the trie:\n\n<source lang=\"python\">\nclass Node:\n   def __init__(self) -> None:\n       # Note that using dictionary for children (as in this implementation)\n       # would not allow lexicographic sorting mentioned in the next section\n       # (Sorting), because an ordinary dictionary would not preserve the\n       # order of the keys\n       self.children : Dict[str, Node] = {}  # mapping from character ==> Node\n       self.value : Any = None\n</source>\n\nNote that <code>children</code> is a dictionary of characters to a node's children; and it is said that a \"terminal\" node is one which represents a complete string.<br>A trie's value can be looked up as follows:\n\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef find(node: Node, key: str) -> Any:\n    \"\"\"Find value by key in node.\"\"\"\n    for char in key:\n        if char in node.children:\n            node = node.children[char]\n        else:\n            return None\n    return node.value\n</source>\n\nSlight modifications of this routine can be utilized\n* to check if there is any word in the trie that starts with a given prefix, and\n* to return the deepest node corresponding to some prefix of a given string.    \n\nInsertion proceeds by walking the trie according to the string to be inserted, then appending new nodes for the suffix of the string that is not contained in the trie:\n\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef insert(node: Node, key: str, value: Any) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Insert key/value pair into node.\"\"\"\n    for char in key:\n        if char not in node.children:\n            node.children[char] = Node()\n        node = node.children[char]\n    node.value = value\n</source>\n\n=== Sorting ===\nLexicographic sorting of a set of keys can be accomplished by building a trie from them, and traversing it in [[Tree traversal#Pre-order|pre-order]], printing only the leaves' values.

The set of strings stored in this trie is {{mono|{baby, bad, bank, box, dad, dance}}}. The lists are sorted to allow traversal in lexicographic order.]]\nThere are several ways to represent tries, corresponding to different trade-offs between memory use and speed of the operations. The basic form is that of a linked set of nodes, where each node contains an array of child pointers, one for each symbol in the [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] (so for the [[English alphabet]], one would store 26 child pointers and for the alphabet of bytes, 256 pointers). This is simple but wasteful in terms of memory: using the alphabet of bytes (size 256) and four-byte pointers, each node requires a kilobyte of storage, and when there is little overlap in the strings' prefixes, the number of required nodes is roughly the combined length of the stored strings.{{r|brass}}{{rp|341}} Put another way, the nodes near the bottom of the tree tend to have few children and there are many of them, so the structure wastes space storing null pointers.<ref name=\"allison\"/>\n\nThe storage problem can be alleviated by an implementation technique called ''alphabet reduction'', whereby the original strings are reinterpreted as longer strings over a smaller alphabet. E.g., a string of {{mvar|n}} bytes can alternatively be regarded as a string of {{math|2''n''}} [[Nibble|four-bit units]] and stored in a trie with sixteen pointers per node. Lookups need to visit twice as many nodes in the worst case, but the storage requirements go down by a factor of eight.{{r|brass}}{{rp|347\u2013352}}\n\nAn alternative implementation represents a node as a triple {{mono|(symbol, child, next)}} and links the children of a node together as a [[singly linked list]]: {{mono|child}} points to the node's first child, {{mono|next}} to the parent node's next child.<ref name=\"allison\">{{cite web |first=Lloyd |last=Allison |title=Tries |url=http://www.allisons.org/ll/AlgDS/Tree/Trie/ |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Data Structures, Algorithms, & Applications in Java |title=Tries |first=Sartaj |last=Sahni |publisher=University of Florida |url=https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~sahni/dsaaj/enrich/c16/tries.htm |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref> The set of children can also be represented as a [[binary search tree]]; one instance of this idea is the [[ternary search tree]] developed by [[Jon Bentley (computer scientist)|Bentley]] and [[Robert Sedgewick (computer scientist)|Sedgewick]].{{r|brass}}{{rp|353}}\n\nAnother alternative in order to avoid the use of an array of 256 pointers (ASCII), as suggested before,  is to store the alphabet array as a bitmap of 256 bits representing the ASCII alphabet, reducing dramatically the size of the nodes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bellekens|first1=Xavier|title=Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks - SIN '14|chapter=A Highly-Efficient Memory-Compression Scheme for GPU-Accelerated Intrusion Detection Systems|date=2014|publisher=ACM|location=Glasgow, Scotland, UK|isbn=978-1-4503-3033-6|pages=302:302\u2013302:309|doi=10.1145/2659651.2659723|arxiv=1704.02272}}</ref>\n\n=== Bitwise tries ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nBitwise tries are much the same as a normal character-based trie except that individual bits are used to traverse what effectively becomes a form of binary tree. Generally, implementations use a special CPU instruction to very quickly [[find first set|find the first set bit]] in a fixed length key (e.g., GCC's <code>__builtin_clz()</code> intrinsic). This value is then used to index a 32- or 64-entry table which points to the first item in the bitwise trie with that number of leading zero bits. The search then proceeds by testing each subsequent bit in the key and choosing <code>child[0]</code> or <code>child[1]</code> appropriately until the item is found.\n\nAlthough this process might sound slow, it is very cache-local and highly parallelizable due to the lack of register dependencies and therefore in fact has excellent performance on modern [[out-of-order execution]] CPUs. A [[red-black tree]] for example performs much better on paper, but is highly cache-unfriendly and causes multiple pipeline and [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] stalls on modern CPUs which makes that algorithm bound by memory latency rather than CPU speed. In comparison, a bitwise trie rarely accesses memory, and when it does, it does so only to read, thus avoiding SMP cache coherency overhead. Hence, it is increasingly becoming the algorithm of choice for code that performs many rapid insertions and deletions, such as memory allocators (e.g., recent versions of the famous [[Malloc#dlmalloc|Doug Lea's allocator (dlmalloc) and its descendants]]). The worst case of steps for lookup is the same as bits used to index bins in the tree.<ref name=\"dlmalloc\">{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Doug |title=A Memory Allocator |url=http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html |accessdate=1 December 2019}} [http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc.c HTTP for Source Code]. Binary Trie is described in Version 2.8.6, Section \"Overlaid data structures\", Structure \"malloc_tree_chunk\".</ref>\n\nAlternatively, the term \"bitwise trie\" can more generally refer to a binary tree structure holding integer values, sorting them by their binary prefix. An example is the [[x-fast trie]].\n\n=== Compressing tries ===\nCompressing the trie and merging the common branches can sometimes yield large performance gains.

In such a case, the trie is keyed by the bit element position within the full set. The key is created from the string of bits needed to encode the integral position of each element. Such tries have a very degenerate form with many missing branches. After detecting the repetition of common patterns or filling the unused gaps, the unique leaf nodes (bit strings) can be stored and compressed easily, reducing the overall size of the trie.\n\nSuch compression is also used in the implementation of the various fast lookup tables for retrieving [[Unicode]] character properties. These could include case-mapping tables (e.g., for the [[Greek language|Greek]] letter [[pi (letter)|pi]], from \u03a0 to \u03c0), or lookup tables normalizing the combination of base and combining characters (like the a-[[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] in [[German language|German]], \u00e4, or the [[dalet#Hebrew Dalet|dalet]]-[[patah]]-[[dagesh]]-[[ole (cantillation)|ole]] in [[Biblical Hebrew]], {{Hebrew|\u05d3\u05b7\u05bc\u05ab}}). For such applications, the representation is similar to transforming a very large, unidimensional, sparse table (e.g., Unicode code points) into a multidimensional matrix of their combinations, and then using the coordinates in the hyper-matrix as the string key of an uncompressed trie to represent the resulting character. The compression will then consist of detecting and merging the common columns within the hyper-matrix to compress the last dimension in the key. For example, to avoid storing the full, multibyte Unicode code point of each element forming a matrix column, the groupings of similar code points can be exploited. Each dimension of the hyper-matrix stores the start position of the next dimension, so that only the offset (typically a single byte) need be stored. The resulting vector is itself compressible when it is also sparse, so each dimension (associated to a layer level in the trie) can be compressed separately.\n\nSome implementations do support such data compression within dynamic sparse tries and allow insertions and deletions in compressed tries. However, this usually has a significant cost when compressed segments need to be split or merged. Some tradeoff has to be made between data compression and update speed. A typical strategy is to limit the range of global lookups for comparing the common branches in the sparse trie.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe result of such compression may look similar to trying to transform the trie into a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG), because the reverse transform from a DAG to a trie is obvious and always possible. However, the shape of the DAG is determined by the form of the key chosen to index the nodes, in turn constraining the compression possible.\n\nAnother compression strategy is to \"unravel\" the data structure into a single byte array.<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W09/W09-1505.pdf\n|title = Tightly packed tries: how to fit large models into memory, and make them load fast, too\n|year = 2009\n|author1=Ulrich Germann |author2=Eric Joanis |author3=Samuel Larkin |work = ACL Workshops: Proceedings of the Workshop on Software Engineering, Testing, and Quality Assurance for Natural Language Processing\n|publisher = Association for Computational Linguistics\n|pages = 31\u201339\n|quote = We present Tightly Packed Tries (TPTs), a compact implementation of read-only, compressed trie structures with fast on-demand paging and short load times.

Unlike a [[binary search tree]], no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated, i.e., the value of the key is distributed across the structure. All the descendants of a node have a common [[prefix]] of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the [[empty string]]. Keys tend to be associated with leaves, though some inner nodes may correspond to keys of interest. Hence, keys are not necessarily associated with every node. For the space-optimized presentation of prefix tree, see [[compact prefix tree]].\n\nIn the example shown, keys are listed in the nodes and values below them. Each complete English word has an arbitrary integer value associated with it. A trie can be seen as a tree-shaped [[deterministic finite automaton]]. Each [[finite language]] is generated by a trie automaton, and each trie can be compressed into a [[deterministic acyclic finite state automaton]].\n\nThough tries can be keyed by character strings, they need not be. The same algorithms can be adapted to serve similar functions on ordered lists of any construct, e.g. permutations on a list of digits or shapes. In particular, a '''bitwise trie''' is keyed on the individual bits making up any fixed-length binary datum, such as an integer or memory address.\n\n==History and etymology==\nTries were first described by Ren\u00e9 de la Briandais in 1959.<ref>{{cite conference |first=Ren\u00e9 |last=de la Briandais |year=1959 |title=File searching using variable length keys |conference=Proc.

An imperfect hash table can have key collisions. A key collision is the hash function mapping of different keys to the same position in a hash table. The worst-case lookup speed in an imperfect hash table is [[Hash table#Chaining|O(N)]] time, but far more typically is O(1), with O(m) time spent evaluating the hash.\n* There are no collisions of different keys in a trie.\n* Buckets in a trie, which are analogous to hash table buckets that store key collisions, are necessary only if a single key is associated with more than one value.\n* There is no need to provide a hash function or to change hash functions as more keys are added to a trie.\n* A trie can provide an alphabetical ordering of the entries by key.\n\nHowever, a trie also has some drawbacks compared to a hash table:\n\n* Trie lookup can be slower than hash table lookup, especially if the data is directly accessed on a hard disk drive or some other secondary storage device where the random-access time is high compared to main memory.<ref name=\"triememory\">{{cite journal | author=Edward Fredkin| authorlink=Edward Fredkin| title=Trie Memory| journal=Communications of the ACM| year=1960| volume=3| issue=9| pages=490\u2013499| doi=10.1145/367390.367400 }}</ref>\n* Some keys, such as floating point numbers, can lead to long chains and prefixes that are not particularly meaningful.

Such applications take advantage of a trie's ability to quickly search for, insert, and delete entries; however, if storing dictionary words is all that is required (i.e., storage of information auxiliary to each word is not required), a minimal [[deterministic acyclic finite state automaton]] (DAFSA) would use less space than a trie. This is because a DAFSA can compress identical branches from the trie which correspond to the same suffixes (or parts) of different words being stored.\n\nTries are also well suited for implementing approximate matching algorithms,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Aho | first1 = Alfred V. | last2 = Corasick | first2 = Margaret J. | date = Jun 1975 | title = Efficient String Matching: An Aid to Bibliographic Search | journal = [[Communications of the ACM]] | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 333\u2013340 | jstor =  | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3547/ac839d02f6efe3f6f76a8289738a22528442.pdf | format =  | accessdate = | doi=10.1145/360825.360855}}</ref> including those used in [[spell checking]] and [[Hyphenation algorithm|hyphenation]]<ref name=\"Liang1983\"/> software.\n\n=== Term indexing ===\n\nA [[discrimination tree]] [[term indexing|term index]] stores its information in a trie data structure.<ref>\nJohn W.

The set of strings stored in this trie is {{mono|{baby, bad, bank, box, dad, dance}}}. The lists are sorted to allow traversal in lexicographic order.]]\nThere are several ways to represent tries, corresponding to different trade-offs between memory use and speed of the operations. The basic form is that of a linked set of nodes, where each node contains an array of child pointers, one for each symbol in the [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] (so for the [[English alphabet]], one would store 26 child pointers and for the alphabet of bytes, 256 pointers). This is simple but wasteful in terms of memory: using the alphabet of bytes (size 256) and four-byte pointers, each node requires a kilobyte of storage, and when there is little overlap in the strings' prefixes, the number of required nodes is roughly the combined length of the stored strings.{{r|brass}}{{rp|341}} Put another way, the nodes near the bottom of the tree tend to have few children and there are many of them, so the structure wastes space storing null pointers.<ref name=\"allison\"/>\n\nThe storage problem can be alleviated by an implementation technique called ''alphabet reduction'', whereby the original strings are reinterpreted as longer strings over a smaller alphabet. E.g., a string of {{mvar|n}} bytes can alternatively be regarded as a string of {{math|2''n''}} [[Nibble|four-bit units]] and stored in a trie with sixteen pointers per node. Lookups need to visit twice as many nodes in the worst case, but the storage requirements go down by a factor of eight.{{r|brass}}{{rp|347\u2013352}}\n\nAn alternative implementation represents a node as a triple {{mono|(symbol, child, next)}} and links the children of a node together as a [[singly linked list]]: {{mono|child}} points to the node's first child, {{mono|next}} to the parent node's next child.<ref name=\"allison\">{{cite web |first=Lloyd |last=Allison |title=Tries |url=http://www.allisons.org/ll/AlgDS/Tree/Trie/ |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Data Structures, Algorithms, & Applications in Java |title=Tries |first=Sartaj |last=Sahni |publisher=University of Florida |url=https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~sahni/dsaaj/enrich/c16/tries.htm |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref> The set of children can also be represented as a [[binary search tree]]; one instance of this idea is the [[ternary search tree]] developed by [[Jon Bentley (computer scientist)|Bentley]] and [[Robert Sedgewick (computer scientist)|Sedgewick]].{{r|brass}}{{rp|353}}\n\nAnother alternative in order to avoid the use of an array of 256 pointers (ASCII), as suggested before,  is to store the alphabet array as a bitmap of 256 bits representing the ASCII alphabet, reducing dramatically the size of the nodes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bellekens|first1=Xavier|title=Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks - SIN '14|chapter=A Highly-Efficient Memory-Compression Scheme for GPU-Accelerated Intrusion Detection Systems|date=2014|publisher=ACM|location=Glasgow, Scotland, UK|isbn=978-1-4503-3033-6|pages=302:302\u2013302:309|doi=10.1145/2659651.2659723|arxiv=1704.02272}}</ref>\n\n=== Bitwise tries ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nBitwise tries are much the same as a normal character-based trie except that individual bits are used to traverse what effectively becomes a form of binary tree. Generally, implementations use a special CPU instruction to very quickly [[find first set|find the first set bit]] in a fixed length key (e.g., GCC's <code>__builtin_clz()</code> intrinsic). This value is then used to index a 32- or 64-entry table which points to the first item in the bitwise trie with that number of leading zero bits. The search then proceeds by testing each subsequent bit in the key and choosing <code>child[0]</code> or <code>child[1]</code> appropriately until the item is found.\n\nAlthough this process might sound slow, it is very cache-local and highly parallelizable due to the lack of register dependencies and therefore in fact has excellent performance on modern [[out-of-order execution]] CPUs. A [[red-black tree]] for example performs much better on paper, but is highly cache-unfriendly and causes multiple pipeline and [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] stalls on modern CPUs which makes that algorithm bound by memory latency rather than CPU speed. In comparison, a bitwise trie rarely accesses memory, and when it does, it does so only to read, thus avoiding SMP cache coherency overhead. Hence, it is increasingly becoming the algorithm of choice for code that performs many rapid insertions and deletions, such as memory allocators (e.g., recent versions of the famous [[Malloc#dlmalloc|Doug Lea's allocator (dlmalloc) and its descendants]]). The worst case of steps for lookup is the same as bits used to index bins in the tree.<ref name=\"dlmalloc\">{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Doug |title=A Memory Allocator |url=http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html |accessdate=1 December 2019}} [http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc.c HTTP for Source Code]. Binary Trie is described in Version 2.8.6, Section \"Overlaid data structures\", Structure \"malloc_tree_chunk\".</ref>\n\nAlternatively, the term \"bitwise trie\" can more generally refer to a binary tree structure holding integer values, sorting them by their binary prefix. An example is the [[x-fast trie]].\n\n=== Compressing tries ===\nCompressing the trie and merging the common branches can sometimes yield large performance gains. This works best under the following conditions:\n* The trie is (mostly) static, so that no key insertions to or deletions are required (e.g. after bulk creation of the trie).\n* Only lookups are needed.\n* The trie nodes are not keyed by node-specific data, or the nodes' data are common.<ref>{{cite journal\n|url        = http://www.pg.gda.pl/~jandac/daciuk98.ps.gz\n|title      = Incremental Construction of Minimal Acyclic Finite-State Automata\n|year       = 2000\n|author1=Jan Daciuk |author2=Stoyan Mihov |author3=Bruce W.

In such a case, the trie is keyed by the bit element position within the full set. The key is created from the string of bits needed to encode the integral position of each element. Such tries have a very degenerate form with many missing branches. After detecting the repetition of common patterns or filling the unused gaps, the unique leaf nodes (bit strings) can be stored and compressed easily, reducing the overall size of the trie.\n\nSuch compression is also used in the implementation of the various fast lookup tables for retrieving [[Unicode]] character properties. These could include case-mapping tables (e.g. for the [[Greek language|Greek]] letter [[pi (letter)|pi]], from \u03a0 to \u03c0), or lookup tables normalizing the combination of base and combining characters (like the a-[[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] in [[German language|German]], \u00e4, or the [[dalet#Hebrew Dalet|dalet]]-[[patah]]-[[dagesh]]-[[ole (cantillation)|ole]] in [[Biblical Hebrew]], {{Hebrew|\u05d3\u05b7\u05bc\u05ab}}). For such applications, the representation is similar to transforming a very large, unidimensional, sparse table (e.g. Unicode code points) into a multidimensional matrix of their combinations, and then using the coordinates in the hyper-matrix as the string key of an uncompressed trie to represent the resulting character. The compression will then consist of detecting and merging the common columns within the hyper-matrix to compress the last dimension in the key. For example, to avoid storing the full, multibyte Unicode code point of each element forming a matrix column, the groupings of similar code points can be exploited. Each dimension of the hyper-matrix stores the start position of the next dimension, so that only the offset (typically a single byte) need be stored. The resulting vector is itself compressible when it is also sparse, so each dimension (associated to a layer level in the trie) can be compressed separately.\n\nSome implementations do support such data compression within dynamic sparse tries and allow insertions and deletions in compressed tries. However, this usually has a significant cost when compressed segments need to be split or merged. Some tradeoff has to be made between data compression and update speed. A typical strategy is to limit the range of global lookups for comparing the common branches in the sparse trie.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe result of such compression may look similar to trying to transform the trie into a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG), because the reverse transform from a DAG to a trie is obvious and always possible. However, the shape of the DAG is determined by the form of the key chosen to index the nodes, in turn constraining the compression possible.\n\nAnother compression strategy is to \"unravel\" the data structure into a single byte array.<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W09/W09-1505.pdf\n|title = Tightly packed tries: how to fit large models into memory, and make them load fast, too\n|year = 2009\n|author1=Ulrich Germann |author2=Eric Joanis |author3=Samuel Larkin |work = ACL Workshops: Proceedings of the Workshop on Software Engineering, Testing, and Quality Assurance for Natural Language Processing\n|publisher = Association for Computational Linguistics\n|pages = 31\u201339\n|quote = We present Tightly Packed Tries (TPTs), a compact implementation of read-only, compressed trie structures with fast on-demand paging and short load times. We demonstrate the benefits of TPTs for storing n-gram back-off language models and phrase tables for [[statistical machine translation]]. Encoded as TPTs, these databases require less space than flat text file representations of the same data compressed with the gzip utility. At the same time, they can be mapped into memory quickly and be searched directly in time linear in the length of the key, without the need to decompress the entire file. The overhead for local decompression during search is marginal.\n}}</ref>\nThis approach eliminates the need for node pointers, substantially reducing the memory requirements. This in turn permits memory mapping and the use of virtual memory to efficiently load the data from disk.\n\nOne more approach is to \"pack\" the trie.<ref name=Liang1983>{{cite thesis|degree=Doctor of Philosophy|title=Word Hy-phen-a-tion By Com-put-er|url=http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/liang-thesis.pdf|author=Franklin Mark Liang|year=1983|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2010-03-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111105124/http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/liang-thesis.pdf|url-status=live|archivedate=2005-11-11}}<!-- At time of writing, this template doesn't support archive URLs.

Ian went on to be influenced by British heavy metal bands such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] and [[Judas Priest]], as well as the [[punk rock]] band The [[Ramones]]. The musical style of his playing and songwriting including fast alternate picking was also largely influenced by the German metal band [[Accept (band)|Accept]]. \n\nIan states that [[Malcolm Young]], [[Rudolf Schenker]], and [[Johnny Ramone]] were his biggest influences to pursue rhythm guitar.\n\n===Anthrax===\n[[File:20140614-084-Nova_Rock_2014-Anthrax-Scott_Ian.JPG|thumb|left|Scott Ian at [[Nova Rock Festival|Nova Rock]] 2014]]\nAs a founding member of Anthrax, Ian helped to create [[thrash metal]] in the mid-1980s alongside [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]], and [[Metallica]]. Ian came up with the idea to collaborate with the rap group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], covering their song \"[[Bring the Noise]]\" in 1991. This has been considered a foundational recording of the rap/rock genre. In 2005, Ian was invited by [[Chuck D]] of Public Enemy to perform \"Bring the Noise\" with them as part of their induction into VH1's Hip Hop Honors Hall of Fame. Ian also joined Public Enemy on the ''Rock the Bells'' tour in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/04/rock-roll-hall-fame-inductees-2013-best-covers-public-enemy-heart-donna-summer-rush-randy-newman-albert-king/130417-anthrax/|title=Anthrax and Public Enemy \u2013 \u201cBring The Noise\u201d (originally by Public Enemy) SPIN|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/anthrax/bring-the-noise|title=Bring The Noise by Anthrax - Songfacts|last=Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref>\n\n===Other ventures===\nIan began working with music television channel VH1 in 2001, when he was asked to host the program ''Rock Show''. During his 48 episodes as host, Ian interviewed guests including [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Rob Halford]], [[Ted Nugent]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]], [[Megadeth]], [[3 Doors Down]], [[Sevendust]], [[Tenacious D]], and [[the Cult]]. The musician was a regular commentator on various VH1 shows including the ''I Love the...'' series, ''100 Most Metal Moments'', ''Awesomely Bad Number One Songs'', ''When Metallica Ruled the World'', and episodes of [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'' featuring Metallica, [[Pantera]] and Anthrax. Ian was prominently featured in VH1's ''History of Heavy Metal''. In June 2006, Ian starred in the VH1 reality series ''[[Supergroup (TV series)|SuperGroup]]'' with Ted Nugent, [[Sebastian Bach]], [[Jason Bonham]] and [[Evan Seinfeld]].\n\nIan plays guitar in the group ''Pearl'' (with his wife, [[Pearl Aday]]), who toured with [[Velvet Revolver]] and [[Meat Loaf]]. Pearl's debut album was released on January 19, 2010, through [[Megaforce Records]]. Ian performed with Pearl on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on January 20, 2010.\n\nIn 2008, [[DC Comics]] asked Ian to write a two-issue prestige-format comics series for the character [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]].

Ian went on to be influenced by British heavy metal bands such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] and [[Judas Priest]], as well as the [[punk rock]] band The [[Ramones]]. The musical style of his playing and songwriting including fast alternate picking was also largely influenced by the German metal band [[Accept (band)|Accept]]. \n\nIan states that [[Malcolm Young]], [[Rudolf Schenker]], and [[Johnny Ramone]] were his biggest influences to pursue rhythm guitar.\n\n===Anthrax===\n[[File:20140614-084-Nova_Rock_2014-Anthrax-Scott_Ian.JPG|thumb|left|Scott Ian at [[Nova Rock Festival|Nova Rock]] 2014]]\nAs a founding member of Anthrax, Ian helped to create [[thrash metal]] in the mid-1980s alongside [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]], and [[Metallica]].
