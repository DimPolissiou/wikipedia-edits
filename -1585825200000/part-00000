In humans, the viruses cause [[respiratory infection]]s, including the [[common cold]], which are typically mild, though rarer forms such as [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] (including the one causing [[COVID-19]]) and [[Middle East respiratory syndrome|MERS]] can be lethal. Symptoms vary in other species: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory disease, while in cows and pigs coronaviruses cause diarrhea. There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. They are [[enveloped virus]]es with a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded]] [[RNA]] [[genome]] and a [[nucleocapsid]] of helical symmetry. The [[genome size]] of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 [[Kilobase#Length measurements|kilobases]], among the largest for an [[RNA virus]] (only second to a 41-kb

Another important structural [[protein]] is the [[phosphoprotein]] N, which is responsible for the helical symmetry of the nucleocapsid that encloses the genomic RNA.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McBride |first1=Ruth |last2=van Zyl |first2=Marjorie |last3=Fielding |first3=Burtram C. |title=The Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Is a Multifunctional Protein |journal=Viruses |date=7 August 2014 |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=2991\u20133018 |doi=10.3390/v6082991 |pmid=25105276 |pmc=4147684 }}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe family ''Coronaviridae'' is organized in 2 sub-families, 5 genera, 23 sub-genera and about 40 species:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/|title=Virus Taxonomy: 2018 Release|date=October 2018|website=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)|language=en|accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n*''Coronaviridae''\n**''[[Orthocoronavirinae]]''<ref name=\"FanZhao2019\">{{cite journal|last1=Fan|first1=Yi|last2=Zhao|first2=Kai|last3=Shi|first3=Zheng-Li|last4=Zhou|first4=Peng|title=Bat Coronaviruses in China|journal=Viruses|volume=11|issue=3|year=2019|pages=210|issn=1999-4915|doi=10.3390/v11030210|pmid=30832341|pmc=6466186}}</ref>\n**''[[Letovirinae]]''\n***''[[Alphaletovirus]]''\n****''[[Milecovirus]]''\n*****''[[Microhyla letovirus 1]]''\n\n[[File:Coronavirus virion structure.svg|thumb|218x218px|illustration of coronavirus virion]]\n\n===Coronavirus===\n{{main|Coronavirus}}\n[[File:Coronavirusdiagram.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a coronavirus]]\nCoronavirus is the common name for ''Coronaviridae'' and ''Orthocoronavirinae'', also called ''Coronavirinae''.<ref name=\"2017.012-015S\">{{cite web |title=2017.012-015S |url=https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv/proposals/2017.012_015S.A.v1.Nidovirales.zip |website=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) |accessdate=24 January 2020 |language=en |format=xlsx |date=October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190514162836/https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv/proposals/2017.012_015S.A.v1.Nidovirales.zip |archive-date=14 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"OrthocoronavirinaeICTV\">{{cite web |title=ICTV Taxonomy history: ''Orthocoronavirinae'' |url=https://talk.ictvonline.org//taxonomy/p/taxonomy-history?taxnode_id=201851847 |website=International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) |accessdate=24 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Coronaviruses cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, the viruses cause [[respiratory infection]]s, including the [[common cold]], which are typically mild, though rarer forms such as [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] (including the one causing [[COVID-19]]) and [[Middle East respiratory syndrome|MERS]] can be lethal. Symptoms vary in other species: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory disease, while in cows and pigs coronaviruses cause diarrhea. There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. They are [[enveloped virus]]es with a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded]] [[RNA]] [[genome]] and a [[nucleocapsid]] of helical symmetry. The [[genome size]] of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 [[Kilobase#Length measurements|kilobases]], among the largest for an [[RNA virus]] (only second to a 41-kb [[Nidovirales|nidovirus]] recently discovered in [[Planarian|planaria]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/coronavirus|title=Coronavirus - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saberi|first=Amir|last2=Gulyaeva|first2=Anastasia A.|last3=Brubacher|first3=John L.|last4=Newmark|first4=Phillip A.|last5=Gorbalenya|first5=Alexander E.|date=2018-11-01|editor-last=Perlman|editor-first=Stanley|title=A planarian nidovirus expands the limits of RNA genome size|url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007314|journal=PLOS Pathogens|language=en|volume=14|issue=11|pages=e1007314|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007314|issn=1553-7374|pmc=PMC6211748|pmid=30383829}}</ref> The name \"coronavirus\" is derived from the Ancient Greek '\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7' (korone), meaning ''crown'' or ''halo'', which refers to the characteristic appearance of the virus particles (virions): they have a fringe reminiscent of a crown or of a [[solar corona]].\n\n====''Orthocoronavirinae'' taxonomy====\n*''Orthocoronavirinae\n**''[[Alphacoronavirus]]''\n***''[[Colacovirus]]''\n****''[[Bat coronavirus CDPHE15]]''\n***''[[Decacovirus]]''\n****''[[Bat coronavirus HKU10]]''\n****''[[Rhinolophus ferrumequinum alphacoronavirus HuB-2013]]''\n***''[[Duvinacovirus]]''\n****''[[Human coronavirus 229E]]''\n***''[[Luchacovirus]]''\n****''[[Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus]]''\n***''[[Minacovirus]]''\n****''[[Ferret coronavirus]]''\n****''[[Mink coronavirus 1]]''\n***''[[Minunacovirus]]''\n****''[[Miniopterus bat coronavirus 1]]''\n****''[[Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8]]''\n***''[[Myotacovirus]]''\n****''[[Myotis ricketti alphacoronavirus Sax-2011]]''\n***''[[Nyctacovirus]]''\n****''[[Nyctalus velutinus alphacoronavirus SC-2013]]''\n***''[[Pedacovirus]]''\n****''[[Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus]]''\n****''[[Scotophilus bat coronavirus 512]]''\n***''[[Rhinacovirus]]''\n****''[[Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2]]''\n***''[[Setracovirus]]''\n****''[[Human coronavirus NL63]]''\n****''[[NL63-related bat coronavirus strain BtKYNL63-9b]]''\n***''[[Tegacovirus]]''\n****''[[Alphacoronavirus 1]]'' \u2013 [[type species]]\n**''[[Betacoronavirus]]''\n***''[[Embecovirus]]''\n****''[[Betacoronavirus 1]]''\n*****''[[Human coronavirus OC43]]''\n****''[[China Rattus coronavirus HKU24]]''\n****''[[Human coronavirus HKU1]]''\n****''[[Murine coronavirus]]'' \u2013 [[type species]]\n***''[[Hibecovirus]]''\n****''[[Bat Hp-betacoronavirus Zhejiang2013]]''\n***''[[Merbecovirus]]''\n****''[[Hedgehog coronavirus 1]]''\n****''[[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus]]'' (MERS-CoV)\n****''[[Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5]]''\n****''[[Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4]]''\n***''[[Nobecovirus]]''\n****''[[Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1]]''\n****''[[Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9]]''\n***''[[Sarbecovirus]]''\n****''[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus]]''\n*****''[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus]]'' (SARS-CoV)\n*****''[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]]'' (SARS-CoV-2,  COVID-19)\n**''[[Deltacoronavirus]]''\n***''[[Andecovirus]]''\n****''[[Wigeon coronavirus HKU20]]''\n***''[[Buldecovirus]]''\n****''[[Bulbul coronavirus HKU11]]'' \u2013 [[type species]]\n****''[[Porcine coronavirus HKU15]]''\n****''[[Munia coronavirus HKU13]]''\n****''[[White-eye coronavirus HKU16]]''\n***''[[Herdecovirus]]''\n****''[[Night heron coronavirus HKU19]]''\n***''[[Moordecovirus]]''\n****''[[Common moorhen coronavirus HKU21]]''\n**''[[Gammacoronavirus]]''\n***''[[Cegacovirus]]''\n****''[[Beluga whale coronavirus SW1]]''\n***''[[Igacovirus]]''\n****''[[Avian coronavirus]]'' \u2013 [[type species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Viruses}}\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikispecies}}\n\n*[http://www.viprbrc.org/brc/home.do?decorator=corona Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR): Coronaviridae]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070309144307/http://www-micro.msb.le.ac.uk/3035/Coronaviruses.html Archived Web page from 2006 on coronaviruses]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194638/http://www.horizonpress.com/blogger/2007/09/focus-on-coronaviruses.html Focus on Coronaviruses (Microbiology Blog post from 2007)]\n*[http://www.expasy.org/viralzone/all_by_species/30.html Viralzone: Coronaviridae]\n*[http://ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]\n\n{{Baltimore classification}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1134583}}\n\n[[Category:Nidovirales]]\n[[Category:Coronaviridae| ]]\n[[Category:Virus families]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCoronavirus:Fix PMC warnings", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronaviridae"}

The artificial turf at the stadium has been replaced by an all-natural grass pitch. The new grass is from Reivera Bermuda seeds procured from the USA and below it there are two layers of sand and gravel. The next layer is fitted with perforated pipes so that water-logging won\u2019t be an issue.\n\nGerman company Porplastic provided the elastic coating for the running track around the pitch which was replaced for the first time since the stadium was built in 1984.

Umbro designs, sources, and markets football-related apparel, footwear, and equipment. Its products are sold in over 90 countries worldwide. Since 2012, the company has been a subsidiary of American company [[Iconix Brand Group]]<ref>[http://www.iconixbrand.com/umbro_history.html Umbro at Iconix Brand website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210041507/http://www.iconixbrand.com/umbro_history.html |date=10 February 2013 }}, retrieved 11 February 2013</ref>, after being bought by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] in 2007.\n\n==History==\n===Beginning and expansion===\nThe company was founded by Harold Humphreys, along with his brother Wallace in a small workshop in [[Wilmslow]], [[Cheshire]], inspired by the growing interest in [[association football|football]] witnessed nationwide. The name \"Umbro\" is a quasi-[[portmanteau]] inspired by Humphreys Brothers Clothing. Umbro's kit debut was in the 1934 [[FA Cup]] final, when both teams [[Manchester City]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] wore kits designed and manufactured by the company. Other teams supplied by Umbro during the 1930s and 1940s were [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Preston North End W.F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].\n\nUmbro was the official sports manufacturer of the English [[FA Cup]] and official sponsor of [[The Football Association|The FA]], being the exclusive supplier of [[football (ball)|balls]] to the body's leagues.\n\nIn 1952, the British team at the [[Summer Olympics]] wore Umbro kits, tailored for the needs of their individual sports. Umbro would supply kits for the British Olympics team for the next 20 years.\n\nIn 1957, Umbro entered the [[tennis]] market, producing sports clothing in collaboration with player [[Ted Tinling]]. This collaboration extended for three decades. Another sportsman who collaborated with Umbro was [[Manchester United]] manager [[Matt Busby]], in 1959. That same year the company started to sell its junior boys' kits, a set of shirt, shorts and socks that would allow young players to wear the same look as their footballing idols.\n\n[[File:Brasil_-_1958.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] won its first [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] wearing Umbro kits]]\n[[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] became the first [[FIFA World Cup]] champion to wear kits by Umbro in [[1958 World Cup|1958]]. Two years later, Manchester United [[Scotland|Scottish]] player [[Denis Law]] signed an exclusive agreement with the brand, becoming the first footballer to be sponsored by Umbro. The [[England national football team|England national team]] won its only title in [[1966 World Cup|1966]] wearing kits by Umbro (the deal had been signed in 1954). Of the 16 teams that competed, 15 wore kit manufactured by Umbro,<ref>[http://www.umbro.com/en-gb/about-umbro/ Umbro history website], retrieved 27 March 2013</ref> the only exception being the [[Soviet Union national football team|USSR]]. At the same time, 85% of British football teams wore kits by the company, including [[Glasgow Celtic|Celtic]], the first British team to win a [[European Cup]] in 1967.  Liverpool FC won the first four of their six European Cups while wearing Umbro kits, in 1977, 1978, 1981 and 1984.\n\nIn 1974, Umbro's founder, Harold Humphreys, died. His sons John and Stuart took over the running of the company. The [[England national football team|England national team]] wore Umbro shirts by choice until 1974, when [[The Football Association]], encouraged by the England manager [[Don Revie]], sold the jersey manufacturing rights to [[Admiral Sportswear]].\n\nAfter more than a decade wearing Admiral kits, the England national team signed with Umbro again in 1984. In 1986, Umbro began to manufacture its own [[football boot]]s. The company added footballers [[Alan Shearer]] and [[Michael Owen]] (who was only 14 years old) to its list of sponsored athletes. In 1994, Brazil won its fourth FIFA World Cup title in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|United States]] and club teams [[AFC Ajax]] (in 1995), and Manchester United (in 1999) obtained the [[UEFA Champions League]] and the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]], in [[National Stadium Tokyo|Tokyo]], all of them wearing Umbro kits.\n\nIn the United States, Umbro was the majority owner (94%) of [[United Soccer Leagues]], the parent organization for North America's lower division men's soccer (tiers two through four in the American Soccer Pyramid), and the second tier women's league (W-League) and youth league (Super Y-League).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/124750.html |title= Umbro increases share of USL ownership |publisher=USL Soccer |date=16 March 2006}}</ref> During the 2009 USL First Division season, the [[Carolina RailHawks]], [[Charleston Battery]], [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1986\u20132010)|Vancouver Whitecaps]], [[Rochester Rhinos]], [[Austin Aztex]], and [[Puerto Rico Islanders]] all wore Umbro kits. During the 2012 USLPro season, the [[Dayton Dutch Lions]] wore Umbro.\n\nIn October 2007, [[JJB Sports]] bought a 10.1% stake in Umbro in a move to protect its stake in the market for England football shirts.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7053403.stm |title= JJB Sports acquires 10% in Umbro |publisher=BBC News |date=19 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Nike agreement===\n[[File:Umbro ball usl.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Umbro Dynamis match ball used in the [[USL Championship|United Soccer League]] for the 2009\u201310 season<ref>[http://www.footballshirtculture.com/Balls/usl-umbro-dynamis-match-ball-2009.html USL Umbro Dynamis Match Ball 2009], 16 Jan 2009</ref>]]\nOn 23 October 2007, it was announced Umbro had agreed to be bought by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] in a deal worth {{GBP|285 million}}, the equivalent of 193p per share.

Eventually, in 1985, Umbro decided to introduce its first football boot into the Brazilian market. This design, cheaper than the products of existing boot brands such as [[Adidas]], proved popular and went into mass production internationally two years later.\n\nUmbro also manufactured a popular style of [[shorts]] that reached its peak in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were made of [[nylon]], had a drawstring waistband, and often came in bright colours. With the growth of youth soccer leagues in the U.S. in the 1980s, many youths, teens and young adults began wearing them as everyday clothing. At the height of the \"Umbro fashion,\" other brands of football shorts, such as Adidas, [[Diadora]], [[Hummel International|Hummel]], [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]] and [[Mitre Sports International|Mitre]], also became popular. Its major competitors in this market include Reebok, Nike, Adidas, [[Puma AG|Puma]] and [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]].\n\nOther releases by Umbro include the Stealth boot,<ref>{{cite web|title=Umbro Stealth Booth|url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2010/04/12/umbro-stealth-pro-review/|publisher=SoccerCleats101.com|accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref> released in 2010 and worn by players such as [[Ga\u00ebl Clichy]] and [[Phil Jagielka]].

[[association football|football]] equipment supplier based in [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]], near [[Manchester]]. Umbro designs, sources, and markets football-related apparel, footwear, and equipment. Its products are sold in over 90 countries worldwide. Since 2012, the company has been a subsidiary of American company [[Iconix Brand Group]]<ref>[http://www.iconixbrand.com/umbro_history.html Umbro at Iconix Brand website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210041507/http://www.iconixbrand.com/umbro_history.html |date=10 February 2013 }}, retrieved 11 February 2013</ref>, after being bought by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] in 2007.\n\n==History==\n===Beginning and expansion===\nThe company was founded by Harold Humphreys, along with his brother Wallace in a small workshop in [[Wilmslow]], [[Cheshire]], inspired by the growing interest in [[association football|football]] witnessed nationwide. The name \"Umbro\" is a quasi-[[portmanteau]] inspired by Humphreys Brothers Clothing. Umbro's kit debut was in the 1934 [[FA Cup]] final, when both teams [[Manchester City]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] wore kits designed and manufactured by the company. Other teams supplied by Umbro during the 1930s and 1940s were [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Preston North End W.F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].\n\nUmbro was the official sports manufacturer of the English [[FA Cup]] and official sponsor of [[The Football Association|The FA]], being the exclusive supplier of [[football (ball)|balls]] to the body's leagues.\n\nIn 1952, the British team at the [[Summer Olympics]] wore Umbro kits, tailored for the needs of their individual sports. Umbro would supply kits for the British Olympics team for the next 20 years.\n\nIn 1957, Umbro entered the [[tennis]] market, producing sports clothing in collaboration with player [[Ted Tinling]]. This collaboration extended for three decades. Another sportsman who collaborated with Umbro was [[Manchester United]] manager [[Matt Busby]], in 1959. That same year the company started to sell its junior boys' kits, a set of shirt, shorts and socks that would allow young players to wear the same look as their footballing idols.\n\n[[File:Brasil_-_1958.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] won its first [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] wearing Umbro kits]]\n[[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] became the first [[FIFA World Cup]] champion to wear kits by Umbro in [[1958 World Cup|1958]]. Two years later, Manchester United [[Scotland|Scottish]] player [[Denis Law]] signed an exclusive agreement with the brand, becoming the first footballer to be sponsored by Umbro. The [[England national football team|England national team]] won its only title in [[1966 World Cup|1966]] wearing kits by Umbro (the deal had been signed in 1954). Of the 16 teams that competed, 15 wore kit manufactured by Umbro,<ref>[http://www.umbro.com/en-gb/about-umbro/ Umbro history website], retrieved 27 March 2013</ref> the only exception being the [[Soviet Union national football team|USSR]]. At the same time, 85% of British football teams wore kits by the company, including [[Glasgow Celtic|Celtic]], the first British team to win a [[European Cup]] in 1967.  Liverpool FC won the first four of their six European Cups while wearing Umbro kits, in 1977, 1978, 1981 and 1984.\n\nIn 1974, Umbro's founder, Harold Humphreys, died. His sons John and Stuart took over the running of the company. The [[England national football team|England national team]] wore Umbro shirts by choice until 1974, when [[The Football Association]], encouraged by the England manager [[Don Revie]], sold the jersey manufacturing rights to [[Admiral Sportswear]].\n\nAfter more than a decade wearing Admiral kits, the England national team signed with Umbro again in 1984. In 1986, Umbro began to manufacture its own [[football boot]]s. The company added footballers [[Alan Shearer]] and [[Michael Owen]] (who was only 14 years old) to its list of sponsored athletes. In 1994, Brazil won its fourth FIFA World Cup title in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|United States]] and club teams [[AFC Ajax]] (in 1995), and Manchester United (in 1999) obtained the [[UEFA Champions League]] and the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]], in [[National Stadium Tokyo|Tokyo]], all of them wearing Umbro kits.\n\nIn the United States, Umbro was the majority owner (94%) of [[United Soccer Leagues]], the parent organization for North America's lower division men's soccer (tiers two through four in the American Soccer Pyramid), and the second tier women's league (W-League) and youth league (Super Y-League).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/124750.html |title= Umbro increases share of USL ownership |publisher=USL Soccer |date=16 March 2006}}</ref> During the 2009 USL First Division season, the [[Carolina RailHawks]], [[Charleston Battery]], [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1986\u20132010)|Vancouver Whitecaps]], [[Rochester Rhinos]], [[Austin Aztex]], and [[Puerto Rico Islanders]] all wore Umbro kits. During the 2012 USLPro season, the [[Dayton Dutch Lions]] wore Umbro.\n\nIn October 2007, [[JJB Sports]] bought a 10.1% stake in Umbro in a move to protect its stake in the market for England football shirts.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7053403.stm |title= JJB Sports acquires 10% in Umbro |publisher=BBC News |date=19 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Nike agreement===\n[[File:Umbro ball usl.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Umbro Dynamis match ball used in the [[USL Championship|United Soccer League]] for the 2009\u201310 season<ref>[http://www.footballshirtculture.com/Balls/usl-umbro-dynamis-match-ball-2009.html USL Umbro Dynamis Match Ball 2009], 16 Jan 2009</ref>]]\nOn 23 October 2007, it was announced Umbro had agreed to be bought by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] in a deal worth {{GBP|285 million}}, the equivalent of 193p per share.

Eventually, in 1985, Umbro decided to introduce its first football boot into the Brazilian market. This design, cheaper than the products of existing boot brands such as [[Adidas]], proved popular and went into mass production internationally two years later.\n\nUmbro also manufactured a popular style of [[shorts]] that reached its peak in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were made of [[nylon]], had a drawstring waistband, and often came in bright colours. With the growth of youth soccer leagues in the U.S. in the 1980s, many youths, teens and young adults began wearing them as everyday clothing. At the height of the \"Umbro fashion,\" other brands of football shorts, such as Adidas, [[Diadora]], [[Hummel International|Hummel]], [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]] and [[Mitre Sports International|Mitre]], also became popular. Its major competitors in this market include Reebok, Nike, Adidas, [[Puma AG|Puma]] and [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]].\n\nOther releases by Umbro include the Stealth boot,<ref>{{cite web|title=Umbro Stealth Booth|url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2010/04/12/umbro-stealth-pro-review/|publisher=SoccerCleats101.com|accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref> released in 2010 and worn by players such as [[Ga\u00ebl Clichy]] and [[Phil Jagielka]].

Phillips suggests that Isha Upanishad was likely one of the earliest Upanishads, composed in the 1st half of 1st millennium BCE, after Brihadaranyaka and Chandogya, but before Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki, Kena, Katha, Manduka, Prasna, Svetasvatara and Maitri Upanishads, as well as before the earliest Buddhist Pali and Jaina canons.<ref name=stephenphillips/>\n\nEarlier 19th and 20th-century scholars have similarly expressed a spectrum of views. Isha Upanishad has been chronologically listed by them as being among early Upanishads to being one among the middle Upanishads. [[Paul Deussen|Deussen]]<ref>Paul Deussen, [https://archive.org/stream/philosophyoftheupa00deusuoft#page/n39/mode/2up The Philosophy of the Upanishads], pages 22-26</ref> suggested, for example, that Isha was composed after ancient prose Upanishads - Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki and Kena; during a period when metrical poem-like Upanishads were being composed. Further, he suggests that ''Isha'' was composed before other prose Upanishads such as Prasna, Maitri, Mandukya and all post-Vedic era Upanishads.\n\nWinternitz,<ref>M Winternitz (2010), History of Indian Literature, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802643}}</ref> suggests that Isha Upanishad was probably a pre-Buddha composition along with Katha, Svetasvatara, Mundaka and Prasna Upanishad, but after the first phase of ancient Upanishads that were composed in prose such as Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki and Kena. Winternitz states that Isha was likely composed before post-Buddhist Upanishads such as Maitri and Mandukya.\n\nRanade<ref>RD Ranade, [https://archive.org/stream/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926#page/n47/mode/2up A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy], Chapter 1, pages 13-18</ref> posits that Isha was composed in the second group of Upanishads along with Kena Upanishad, right after the first group of Brihadaranyaka and Chandogya, but chronologically before Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki, Katha, Mundaka, Svetasvatara, Prasna, Mandukya and Maitrayani.\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:MS Indic 37, Isa upanisad. Wellcome L0027330.jpg|thumb|360px|A manuscript page from the Isha Upanisad.]]\nIsha Upanishad is the only Upanishad that is attached to a [[Samhita]], the most ancient layer of Vedic text known for their mantras and benedictions. Other Upanishads are attached to a later layer of Vedic texts such as [[Brahmanas]] and [[Aranyaka]]s. Max Muller notes that this does not necessarily mean that Isha Upanishad is among the oldest,<ref name=mmullercci>Max Muller (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n107/mode/2up Vajasaneyi Samhita Upanishad], Oxford University Press, Introduction section pages c-ci</ref> because Shukla Yajur Veda is acknowledged to be of a later origin than textual layers of other Vedas such as the Rig Veda.\n\nThe 8th-century Indian scholar [[Adi Shankara]], in his ''Bhasya'' (review and commentary) noted that the mantras and hymns of Isha Upanishad are not used in rituals, because their purpose is to enlighten the reader as to \"what is the nature of soul (Atman)?\"; the Upanishad, thus, despite Yajurveda Samhita's liturgical focus, has not historically served as a liturgical text.<ref name=mmullercci/><ref name=adishankaraisha>[https://archive.org/stream/upanishadssrisan00sita#page/n7/mode/2up The Isa, Kena and Mundaka Upanishads and Sri Sankara's Commentary] Adi Shankara, SS Sastri (Translator), pages 1-29</ref> Isha Upanishad is a philosophical text.<ref name=charlesjohnstoncomments>Charles Johnston (1920), {{Google books|8ZUBBQAAQBAJ|The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom}}, Reprinted by Ksetra Books, pages 49-83</ref>\n\n===Difference between recensions===\nThe Isha Upanishad manuscript differs in the two [[shakha]]s of the [[Yajurveda#Shukla Yajurveda|Shukla Yajurveda]]. These are called the Kanva (VSK) and Madhyandina (VSM) recensions. The order of verses 1\u20138 is the same in both, however, Kanva verses 9\u201314 correspond to Madhyandina verses 12, 13, 14, 9, 10, 11. Madhyandina verse 17 is a variation of Kanva 15, Kanva verse 16 is missing in Madhyandina, and Kanva verses 17\u201318 correspond to Madhyandina 15\u201316.\n\nIn both recensions, the Isha Upanishad is the 40th chapter of Shukla Yajur Veda. Versions with 18 verses refer to Kanva, while those with 17 verses are referring to the Madhyandina.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Kanva 40 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18\n|-\n| Madhyandina 40 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 9 || 10 || 11 || (17) || \u2013 || 15 || 16\n|-\n|}\n\n==Content==\n{{Hindu scriptures |expanded=Upanishads}}\n\n===Monism versus theism===\nThe Isha Upanishad is significant for its singular mention of the term \"[[Ishvara|Isha]]\" in the first hymn, a term it never repeats in other hymns. The concept \"Isha\" exhibits [[monism]] in one interpretation, or a form of [[monotheism in Hinduism|monotheism]] in an alternative interpretation, referred to as \"Self\" or \"Deity Lord\" respectively.\n\n{{Quote|\nEnveloped by the Lord must be This All \u2014 each thing that moves on earth.\nWith that renounced, enjoy thyself.

For example, the more recent scholar [[Mah\u012bdhara]] suggested that hymn 1 may be referring to Buddha, an interpretation that Max Muller stated was inadmissible because of the fundamental difference between Hinduism and Buddhism, with Hinduism relying on the premise \"Soul, Self exists\" and Buddhism relying on the premise \"Soul, Self does not exist\".<ref name=maxmullercomments/><ref>John C.

As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism\".</ref>\n\n===Pursuit of Karma versus pursuit of Self===\nThe Isha Upanishad, in hymns 2\u20136, acknowledges the contrasting tension within Hinduism, between the empirical life of householder and action ([[karma]]) and the spiritual life of renunciation and knowledge ([[jnana]]).<ref name=ralphgriffith/>\n{{Quote|\nShould one wish to live a hundred years on this earth, he should live doing Karma. While thus, as man, you live, there is no way other than this by which Karma will not cling to you. Those who partake the nature of the ''Asuras'' [evil], are enveloped in blind darkness, and that is where they reside who ignore their Atman [Self]. For liberation, know your Atman, which is motionless yet faster than mind, it is distant, it is near, it is within all, it is without all this. It is all pervading. And he who beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings, he never turns away from it [the Self].\n|Isha Upanishad, Hymns 2-6<ref name=adishankaraisha/><ref name=maxmullertrans>Max Muller (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/310/mode/2up Vajasaneyi Samhita Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages 311-314</ref>}}\n\nAdi Shankara suggests that \"he\" in hymn 6 (last sentence in above quote) is the \"seeker of emancipation, on a journey to realize Self and Oneness in innermost self and everyone, and includes those in [[sannyasa]]\";<ref name=adishankaraisha/> while Madhvacharya suggests \"he\" is \"the individual soul in loving devotion of God, seeking to get infinitely close to the God soul\".<ref name=madhavabhasya/>\n\nMax Muller, in his review of commentaries by many ancient and medieval Indian scholars,<ref name=maxmullercomments/> states that these verses of Isha Upanishad are proclaiming the \"uselessness of all rituals, whether related to sacrifices or precepts of [[dharma]]\", but simultaneously acknowledging the \"harmlessness and necessity of social activity, that may be seen as potentially intermediate preparation to the path of Knowledge\". The Isha Upanishad, is reminding the reader that neither routine life and rituals are right nor are they wrong, states Max Muller.<ref name=maxmullercomments/> They may be necessary to many, nevertheless, to prepare a person for emancipation, to show the path where cravings feel meaningless, and to produce a serene mind that longs for meaning and one that can discern highest knowledge.<ref name=maxmullercomments/> Ralph Griffith suggests the verses 2-6 of Isha Upanishad are condemning those who perform ''Karma'' in order to \"get future advantages in life or to gain a place in heaven\", because that is ignorance. The avoidance of \"soul knowledge and its eternal, all-pervasive nature\" is akin to \"killing one's soul\" and living a dead life opines Isha Upanishad, states Griffith.<ref name=ralphgriffith/> The pursuit of Self is the seeking of the eternal, the whole, the all-transcending, the self-depending, the Oneness and law of all nature and existence.<ref>Astrid Fitzgerald (2002), Being Consciousness Bliss: A Seeker's Guide, Steiner, {{ISBN|978-0970109781}}, page 52</ref>\n\n===Vidya versus Avidya===\nThe Isha Upanishad suggests that one root of sorrow and suffering is considering one's Self as distinct and conflicted with the Self of others, assuming that the nature of existence is a conflicted duality where one's happiness and suffering is viewed as different from another living being's happiness and suffering. Such sorrow and suffering cannot exist, suggests the Upanishad, if an individual realizes that the Self is in all things, understands the Oneness in all of existence, focuses beyond individual egos and in the pursuit of Universal values, the Self and Real Knowledge.<ref name=charlesjohnstoncomments/>\n{{Quote|\nWhen to a man who understands,<br>\nthe Self has become all things,<br>\nwhat sorrow, what trouble can there be,<br>\nto him who beholds that unity.\n|Isha Upanishad, Hymn 7<ref name=maxmullertrans/>}}\n\nThe Isha Upanishad, in hymn 8 through 11, praises the study of ''Vidya'' (Real Knowledge, eternal truths) and ''Avidya'' (not Real Knowledge, empirical truths).<ref name=maxmullercomments/><ref>Richard H.

For example, the more recent scholar [[Mah\u012bdhara]] suggested that hymn 1 may be referring to Buddha, an interpretation that Max Muller stated was inadmissible because of the fundamental difference between Hinduism and Buddhism, with Hinduism relying on the premise \"Soul, Self exists\" and Buddhism relying on the premise \"Soul, Self does not exist\".<ref name=maxmullercomments/><ref>John C.

As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism\".</ref>\n\n===Pursuit of Karma versus pursuit of Self===\nThe Isha Upanishad, in hymns 2\u20136, acknowledges the contrasting tension within Hinduism, between the empirical life of householder and action ([[karma]]) and the spiritual life of renunciation and knowledge ([[jnana]]).<ref name=ralphgriffith/>\n{{Quote|\nShould one wish to live a hundred years on this earth, he should live doing Karma. While thus, as man, you live, there is no way other than this by which Karma will not cling to you. Those who partake the nature of the ''Asuras'' [evil], are enveloped in blind darkness, and that is where they reside who ignore their Atman [Self]. For liberation, know your Atman, which is motionless yet faster than mind, it is distant, it is near, it is within all, it is without all this. It is all pervading. And he who beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings, he never turns away from it [the Self].\n|Isha Upanishad, Hymns 2-6<ref name=adishankaraisha/><ref name=maxmullertrans>Max Muller (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/310/mode/2up Vajasaneyi Samhita Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages 311-314</ref>}}\n\nAdi Shankara suggests that \"he\" in hymn 6 (last sentence in above quote) is the \"seeker of emancipation, on a journey to realize Self and Oneness in innermost self and everyone, and includes those in [[sannyasa]]\";<ref name=adishankaraisha/> while Madhvacharya suggests \"he\" is \"the individual soul in loving devotion of God, seeking to get infinitely close to the God soul\".<ref name=madhavabhasya/>\n\nMax Muller, in his review of commentaries by many ancient and medieval Indian scholars,<ref name=maxmullercomments/> states that these verses of Isha Upanishad are proclaiming the \"uselessness of all rituals, whether related to sacrifices or precepts of [[dharma]]\", but simultaneously acknowledging the \"harmlessness and necessity of social activity, that may be seen as potentially intermediate preparation to the path of Knowledge\". The Isha Upanishad, is reminding the reader that neither routine life and rituals are right nor are they wrong, states Max Muller.<ref name=maxmullercomments/> They may be necessary to many, nevertheless, to prepare a person for emancipation, to show the path where cravings feel meaningless, and to produce a serene mind that longs for meaning and one that can discern highest knowledge.<ref name=maxmullercomments/> Ralph Griffith suggests the verses 2-6 of Isha Upanishad are condemning those who perform ''Karma'' in order to \"get future advantages in life or to gain a place in heaven\", because that is ignorance. The avoidance of \"soul knowledge and its eternal, all-pervasive nature\" is akin to \"killing one's soul\" and living a dead life opines Isha Upanishad, states Griffith.<ref name=ralphgriffith/> The pursuit of Self is the seeking of the eternal, the whole, the all-transcending, the self-depending, the Oneness and law of all nature and existence.<ref>Astrid Fitzgerald (2002), Being Consciousness Bliss: A Seeker's Guide, Steiner, {{ISBN|978-0970109781}}, page 52</ref>\n\n===Vidya versus Avidya===\nThe Isha Upanishad suggests that one root of sorrow and suffering is considering one's Self as distinct and conflicted with the Self of others, assuming that the nature of existence is a conflicted duality where one's happiness and suffering is viewed as different from another living being's happiness and suffering. Such sorrow and suffering cannot exist, suggests the Upanishad, if an individual realizes that the Self is in all things, understands the Oneness in all of existence, focuses beyond individual egos and in the pursuit of Universal values, the Self and Real Knowledge.<ref name=charlesjohnstoncomments/>\n{{Quote|\nWhen to a man who understands,<br>\nthe Self has become all things,<br>\nwhat sorrow, what trouble can there be,<br>\nto him who beholds that unity.\n|Isha Upanishad, Hymn 7<ref name=maxmullertrans/>}}\n\nThe Isha Upanishad, in hymn 8 through 11, praises the study of ''Vidya'' (Real Knowledge, eternal truths) and ''Avidya'' (not Real Knowledge, empirical truths).<ref name=maxmullercomments/><ref>Richard H.

Due to their isolation from other Gaelic-speaking communities, these East Sutherland villages presented a good opportunity to study [[language death]]. Dorian's study is possibly the longest such study in the field. She is considered \"a prime authority\" on language death.{{sfn|Drechsel|1990|p=554}} ''Language Death: The Life Cycle of a Scottish Gaelic Dialect'', her study into the decline of Gaelic in East Sutherland, is considered \"the first major monograph\"{{sfn|Dressler|1982|p=432}} on language death.

Dorian is now a [[professor emeritus]] at Bryn Mawr.{{sfn|Dorian|2017|p=1}} She is a [[Unitarian Universalist]]; her hymn ''Dear Weaver of our Lives' Design'' won a prize for celebrating feminine imagery of the divine.{{sfn|none|p=9}}\n\nDorian first noticed the Gaelic language while conducting fieldwork for the [[Linguistic Survey of Scotland]] in 1963.{{sfn|Wolfram|2011|p=904}} Noting that a declining localized speech form offered a chance to find out what sorts of changes took place as a speech form passed out of use, she began a long-term study of variation and change in [[East Sutherland Gaelic]].{{sfn|Dorian|2001|p=142}}  When Dorian started studying the dialect, there were still more than 200 speakers in [[Brora]], [[Golspie]] and [[Embo]], including 105 in Embo, where they were more than a third of the population.{{sfn|Duwe|2012|pp=20-21}} Although traditional practice calls for anthropologists to change fieldwork settings, health challenges led Dorian to continue study of East Sutherland language development, a situation that had the beneficial side effect of producing a study of unprecedented scope and continuity.{{sfn|Wolfram|2011|p=904}}{{sfn|Dorian|2014|pp=3, 23, 25}} Previous researchers had focused on the NORM (non-mobile old rural male) speakers, who had more conservative language, at the expense of the wider speech community.<ref name=\"blog\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Celtic academics from across the world prepare for major conference |url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/archiveofnews/2015/july/headline_412294_en.html |publisher=[[University of Glasgow]] |accessdate=7 September 2018 |language=en, gd}}</ref>\n\nShe coined the term \"semi-speaker\" for those, mostly from the younger generations, who could speak Gaelic but imperfectly.<ref name=blog>{{cite web |last1=McEwan-Fujita |first1=Emily |title=Nancy Dorian's \"Greatest Hits\" |url=https://gaelic.co/book-review-dorian-2014/ |website=Gaelic.co |accessdate=7 September 2018 |date=31 July 2015}}</ref> Her attention to the way that speech competence develops differently in endangered and obsolete languages led socio-linguists to take an interest in understanding different [[speaker types]] and their relations to the process of language shift and language shift reversal. Dorian criticized researchers who focused narrowly on single speakers, which conveniently ignored the variation between speakers.{{sfn|McEwan-Fujita|2015|p=431}}<ref name=\"blog\" />\n\nHer book ''The Tyranny of Tide: An Oral History of the East Sutherland Fisherfolk'' blurred the lines between linguistics and ethnology, revealing how these fields help illuminate and complement each other.{{sfn|H.|1988|p=622}}\n\n==Notable works==\n===''Language Death: The Life Cycle of a Scottish Gaelic Dialect'' (1981)===\nDorian published sixteen years of research on East Sutherland Gaelic as ''Language Death: The Life Cycle of a Scottish Gaelic Dialect''.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=227}} According to a review by [[Wolfgang U. Dressler]], it was \"the first major monograph\" on language death.{{sfn|Dressler|1982|p=432}} In the view of Professor Tracy Harris and Suzanne Romaine, it was the most comprehensive work on the subject that had been published; Harris also stated that it was \"a great contribution to the field of linguistics\".{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=227, 229}}{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=272}} Dressler wrote that \"[i]t would take too long to describe all the praiseworthy aspects of this book\",{{sfn|Dressler|1982|p=433}} and that it was \"indispensible\" to scholars of language death.{{sfn|Dressler|1982|p=434}} Romaine highlighted the multidisciplinary perspective with which Dorian had approached her work, producing a book that would appeal to [[ethnographers]], [[sociologists]], [[Celtic studies|Celtic scholars]], [[history of Scotland|historians of Scotland]], and a wide range of linguists, including those specializing in [[sociolinguistics]], [[historical linguistics]], and [[syntax]].{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=273}}\n\nDorian identified some counterintuitive ways in which language shift was functioning in East Sutherland, noting that the Gaelic language was able to adapt to modern life even while becoming moribund. No [[diglossia]] developed, because speakers were able to borrow words from English and apply them to any discussion, even for highly technical topics.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=228}}{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=276}} She was able to classify speakers as \"older fluent speakers\", \"younger fluent speakers\", and \"semi-speakers\", describing the linguistic differences between each speaker type.{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=273}} Her finding that the socioeconomically homogeonous community was characterized by a high degree of variation between speakers was later elaborated in her 2010 book ''Investigating Variation: The Effects of Social Organization and Social Setting''.{{sfn|Wolfram|2011|pp=904-905}} Certain types of syntactic distinctions, such as [[grammatical gender]], [[case (linguistics)|case markings]], and the two [[passive voice|passive constructions]], were lost gradually, rather than erased wholesale, as some theoreticians had predicted.{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=274}} Dorian did not find the same types of linguistic changes which were thought to mark endangered languages.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=229}} \n\nShe postulated that the type of [[language change|change]] in endangered languages was the same as in healthy languages, but the rate of change was greatly accelerated;{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=275}} the defining features of an endangered language were sociolinguistic rather than structural.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=229}} Her research showed that the exclusion of Gaelic from the school curriculum was a major factor in its decline, because it reduced the number of opportunities to use Gaelic and cemented its lower status and \"usefulness\" in the eyes of the community.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=228}}{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=273}} Another important factor, Dorian found, was the presence of prosperous English-speaking incomers which caused the poorer Gaelic speakers to connect the English language with economic success.{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=273}} Later research showed that the features that Dorian identified for Sutherland Gaelic's decline also applied to many other obsolescent languages.{{sfn|Aitchison|1991|p=293}}\n\n===''Investigating Obsolescence: Studies in Language Contraction and Death'' (1989)===\nDorian was inspired to organize this collection of essays when she realized that there were no conferences or journals dedicated to the study of language death, where scholars in the field could share ideas.{{sfn|Aitchison|1991|p=291}} The book was described by Dorian as a \"stepping stone\" to future research into language death.{{sfn|Blyth|1994|p=98}} By examining 37 languages and dialects, the authors of essays contributed to the availability of information on specific minority languages.

Due to their isolation from other Gaelic-speaking communities, these East Sutherland villages presented a good opportunity to study [[language death]]. Dorian's study is possibly the longest such study in the field. She is considered \"a prime authority\" on language death.{{sfn|Drechsel|1990|p=554}} ''Language Death: The Life Cycle of a Scottish Gaelic Dialect'', her study into the decline of Gaelic in East Sutherland, is considered \"the first major monograph\"{{sfn|Dressler|1982|p=432}} on language death.

Dressler]], it was \"the first major monograph\" on language death.{{sfn|Dressler|1982|p=432}} In the view of Professor Tracy Harris and Suzanne Romaine, it was the most comprehensive work on the subject that had been published; Harris also stated that it was \"a great contribution to the field of linguistics\".{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=227, 229}}{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=272}} Dressler wrote that \"[i]t would take too long to describe all the praiseworthy aspects of this book\",{{sfn|Dressler|1982|p=433}} and that it was \"indispensible\" to scholars of language death.{{sfn|Dressler|1982|p=434}} Romaine highlighted the multidisciplinary perspective with which Dorian had approached her work, producing a book that would appeal to [[ethnographers]], [[sociologists]], [[Celtic studies|Celtic scholars]], [[history of Scotland|historians of Scotland]], and a wide range of linguists, including those specializing in [[sociolinguistics]], [[historical linguistics]], and [[syntax]].{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=273}}\n\nDorian identified some counterintuitive ways in which language shift was functioning in East Sutherland, noting that the Gaelic language was able to adapt to modern life even while becoming moribund. No [[diglossia]] developed, because speakers were able to borrow words from English and apply them to any discussion, even for highly technical topics.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=228}}{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=276}} She was able to classify speakers as \"older fluent speakers\", \"younger fluent speakers\", and \"semi-speakers\", describing the linguistic differences between each speaker type.{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=273}} Her finding that the socioeconomically homogeonous community was characterized by a high degree of variation between speakers was later elaborated in her 2010 book ''Investigating Variation: The Effects of Social Organization and Social Setting''.{{sfn|Wolfram|2011|pp=904-905}} Certain types of syntactic distinctions, such as [[grammatical gender]], [[case (linguistics)|case markings]], and the two [[passive voice|passive constructions]], were lost gradually, rather than erased wholesale, as some theoreticians had predicted.{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=274}} Dorian did not find the same types of linguistic changes which were thought to mark endangered languages.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=229}} \n\nShe postulated that the type of [[language change|change]] in endangered languages was the same as in healthy languages, but the rate of change was greatly accelerated;{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=275}} the defining features of an endangered language were sociolinguistic rather than structural.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=229}} Her research showed that the exclusion of Gaelic from the school curriculum was a major factor in its decline, because it reduced the number of opportunities to use Gaelic and cemented its lower status and \"usefulness\" in the eyes of the community.{{sfn|Harris|1982|p=228}}{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=273}} Another important factor, Dorian found, was the presence of prosperous English-speaking incomers which caused the poorer Gaelic speakers to connect the English language with economic success.{{sfn|Romaine|1983|p=273}} Later research showed that the features that Dorian identified for Sutherland Gaelic's decline also applied to many other obsolescent languages.{{sfn|Aitchison|1991|p=293}}\n\n===''Investigating Obsolescence: Studies in Language Contraction and Death'' (1989)===\nDorian was inspired to organize this collection of essays when she realized that there were no conferences or journals dedicated to the study of language death, where scholars in the field could share ideas.{{sfn|Aitchison|1991|p=291}} The book was described by Dorian as a \"stepping stone\" to future research into language death.{{sfn|Blyth|1994|p=98}} By examining 37 languages and dialects, the authors of essays contributed to the availability of information on specific minority languages.

Bach was then ''[[Thomaskantor]]'', responsible for music at four churches in [[Leipzig]], a position he had assumed in 1723.\n\nThe cantata follows the [[nativity of Jesus]] as narrated in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. It covers the [[annunciation to the shepherds]]. An unknown librettist added text for reflecting [[recitative]]s and [[aria]]s and included stanzas from [[Lutheran hymn]]s. Bach structured the cantata in 14 movements and scored it for four vocal parts and a [[Baroque instruments|Baroque orchestra]] with flutes, oboes and strings. He led the first performances at the two main churches of Leipzig on 26 December 1734 during morning and [[vespers]] services.\n\nPart II of the oratorio begins, in contrast to the other parts, with the instrumental [[Sinfonia]], a concerto of shepherds and angels. A [[tenor]] soloist narrates the Biblical story in recitative as the [[Evangelist (Bach)|Evangelist]]. The [[soprano]] soloist makes a first appearance in the oratorio as the [[angel]], and is followed by the choir representing the angels singing \"[[Glory to God in the Highest]]\".

The [[tenor]] soloist narrates the story as the [[Evangelist (Bach)|Evangelist]]. The soprano soloist appears for the first time in the oratorio as the angel bringing the news. The choir represents the angels singing \"Ehre sei Gott in der H\u00f6he\" (Glory to God in the Highest). The scene is reflected in two arias, an alto aria anticipating a [[lullaby]] for the newborn and a tenor aria calling to run to the manger in joy.{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Jones|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=m9JuwslMcq4C&pg=PA118 118\u2013120]}}\n\nThe following table follows the {{lang|de|[[Neue Bach-Ausgabe]]}} (''New Bach Edition'').

Bach was then ''[[Thomaskantor]]'', responsible for music at four churches in [[Leipzig]], a position he had assumed in 1723.\n\nThe cantata follows the [[nativity of Jesus]] as narrated in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. It covers the [[annunciation to the shepherds]]. An unknown librettist added text for reflecting [[recitative]]s and [[aria]]s and included stanzas from [[Lutheran hymn]]s. Bach structured the cantata in 14 movements and scored it for four vocal parts and a [[Baroque instruments|Baroque orchestra]] with flutes, oboes and strings. He led the first performances at the two main churches of Leipzig on 26 December 1734 during morning and [[vespers]] services.\n\nPart II of the oratorio begins, in contrast to the other parts, with the instrumental [[Sinfonia]], a concerto of shepherds and angels. A [[tenor]] soloist narrates the Biblical story in recitative as the [[Evangelist (Bach)|Evangelist]]. The [[soprano]] soloist makes a first appearance in the oratorio as the [[angel]], and is followed by the choir representing the angels singing \"[[Glory to God in the Highest]]\". There are three chorales, one by [[Johann Rist]] and two by [[Paul Gerhardt]], both using the melody of Luther's \"[[Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her]]\".\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Church cantata#Second Day of Christmas}}\nIn 18th-century [[Leipzig]], high holidays were celebrated on three consecutive days, with different prescribed readings and related music each day. [[Christmas]], one of these high holidays, was celebrated from 25 to 27&nbsp;December.

The [[tenor]] soloist narrates the story as the [[Evangelist (Bach)|Evangelist]]. The soprano soloist appears for the first time in the oratorio as the angel bringing the news. The choir represents the angels singing \"Ehre sei Gott in der H\u00f6he\" (Glory to God in the Highest). The scene is reflected in two arias, an alto aria anticipating a [[lullaby]] for the newborn and a tenor aria calling to run to the manger in joy.{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Jones|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=m9JuwslMcq4C&pg=PA118 118\u2013120]}}\n\nThe following table follows the {{lang|de|[[Neue Bach-Ausgabe]]}} (''New Bach Edition'').

Researchers are working to extend the range of antivirals to other families of pathogens.\n\nDesigning safe and effective antiviral drugs is difficult because viruses use the host's cells to replicate. This makes it difficult to find targets for the drug that would interfere with the virus without also harming the host organism's cells. Moreover, the major difficulty in developing vaccines and anti-viral drugs is due to viral variation.\n\nThe emergence of antivirals is the product of a greatly expanded knowledge of the genetic and molecular function of organisms, allowing biomedical researchers to understand the structure and function of viruses, major advances in the techniques for finding new drugs, and the pressure placed on the medical profession to deal with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ([[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]).\n\nThe first experimental antivirals were developed in the 1960s, mostly to deal with [[herpes simplex virus|herpes viruses]], and were found using traditional [[trial-and-error]] drug discovery methods. Researchers grew cultures of cells and infected them with the target virus. They then introduced into the cultures chemicals which they thought might inhibit viral activity and observed whether the level of virus in the cultures rose or fell. Chemicals that seemed to have an effect were selected for closer study.\n\nThis was a very time-consuming, hit-or-miss procedure, and in the absence of a good knowledge of how the target virus worked, it was not efficient in discovering effective antivirals which had few [[adverse effect|side effect]]s. Only in the 1980s, when the full [[genetic sequence]]s of viruses began to be unraveled, did researchers begin to learn how viruses worked in detail, and exactly what chemicals were needed to thwart their reproductive cycle.\n\n==Virus life cycle==\n[[Virus]]es consist of a [[genome]] and sometimes a few [[enzyme]]s stored in a capsule made of [[protein]] (called a [[capsid]]), and sometimes covered with a [[lipid]] layer (sometimes called an 'envelope'). Viruses cannot reproduce on their own and instead propagate by subjugating a host cell to produce copies of themselves, thus producing the next generation.\n\nResearchers working on such \"[[rational drug design]]\" strategies for developing antivirals have tried to attack viruses at every stage of their life cycles. Some species of mushrooms have been found to contain multiple antiviral chemicals with similar synergistic effects.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/ecam/neh107|title=The Pharmacological Potential of Mushrooms|year=2005|last1=Lindequist|first1=Ulrike|last2=Niedermeyer|first2=Timo H.

Private institutions might require annual influenza vaccination.

Parents can also cite religious reasons to avoid public school vaccination mandates, but this reduces herd immunity and increases risk of viral infection.<ref name=\"HDL\" />\n\n====Limitations of vaccines====\n[[Vaccine]]s bolster the body's immune system to better attack viruses in the \"complete particle\" stage, outside of the organism's cells. They traditionally consist of an attenuated (a live weakened) or inactivated (killed) version of the virus. These vaccines can, in very rare cases, harm the host by inadvertently infecting the host with a full-blown viral occupancy {{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}. Recently \"subunit\" vaccines have been devised that consist strictly of protein targets from the pathogen. They stimulate the [[immune system]] without doing serious harm to the host{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}. In either case, when the real pathogen attacks the subject, the immune system responds to it quickly and blocks it.\n\nVaccines are very effective on stable viruses but are of limited use in treating a patient who has already been infected. They are also difficult to successfully deploy against rapidly mutating viruses, such as [[influenza]] (the vaccine for which is updated every year) and [[HIV]]. Antiviral drugs are particularly useful in these cases.\n\n====Antiretroviral therapy as HIV prevention====\nFollowing the [https://hptn.org/research/studies/hptn052 HPTN 052 study] and [http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2533066 PARTNER] study, there is significant evidence to demonstrate that antiretroviral drugs inhibit transmission when the HIV virus in the person living with HIV has been undetectable for 6 months or longer.\n\n=== Public policy ===\n'''Use and distribution'''\n\nGuidelines regarding viral diagnoses and treatments change frequently and limit quality care.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kunin|first1=Marina|last2=Engelhard|first2=Dan|last3=Thomas|first3=Shane|last4=Ashworth|first4=Mark|last5=Piterman|first5=Leon|title=Challenges of the Pandemic Response in Primary Care during Pre-Vaccination Period: A Qualitative Study|journal=Israel Journal of Health Policy Research|date=15 October 2015|volume=4|issue=1|pages=32|doi=10.1186/s13584-015-0028-5|pmid=26473026|pmc=4606524}}</ref> Even when physicians diagnose older patients with influenza, use of antiviral treatment can be low.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lindegren|first1=Mary Louise|last2=Griffin|first2=Marie R.|last3=Williams|first3=John V.|last4=Edwards|first4=Kathryn M.|last5=Zhu|first5=Yuwei|last6=Mitchel|first6=Ed|last7=Fry|first7=Alicia M.|last8=Schaffner|first8=William|last9=Talbot|first9=H.

During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009\u20132010, guidelines for SNS use by local health departments was unclear, revealing gaps in antiviral planning.<ref name=NACCHO/> For example, local health departments that received antivirals from the SNS did not have transparent guidance on the use of the treatments. The gap made it difficult to create plans and policies for their use and future availabilities, causing delays in treatment.\n\n==Anti-viral targeting==\nThe general idea behind modern antiviral drug design is to identify viral proteins, or parts of proteins, that can be disabled. These \"targets\" should generally be as unlike any proteins or parts of proteins in humans as possible, to reduce the likelihood of side effects. The targets should also be common across many strains of a virus, or even among different species of virus in the same family, so a single drug will have broad effectiveness. For example, a researcher might target a critical enzyme synthesized by the virus, but not by the patient, that is common across strains, and see what can be done to interfere with its operation.\n\nOnce targets are identified, candidate drugs can be selected, either from drugs already known to have appropriate effects or by actually designing the candidate at the molecular level with a [[computer-aided design]] program.\n\nThe target proteins can be manufactured in the lab for testing with candidate treatments by [[genetic engineering|inserting the gene]] that synthesizes the target protein into [[bacteria]] or other kinds of cells. The cells are then cultured for mass production of the protein, which can then be exposed to various treatment candidates and evaluated with \"rapid screening\" technologies.\n\n==Approaches by life cycle stage==\n===Before cell entry===\nOne anti-viral strategy is to interfere with the ability of a virus to infiltrate a target cell. The virus must go through a sequence of steps to do this, beginning with binding to a specific \"[[receptor (biology)|receptor]]\" molecule on the surface of the host cell and ending with the virus \"uncoating\" inside the cell and releasing its contents. Viruses that have a lipid envelope must also fuse their envelope with the target cell, or with a vesicle that transports them into the cell before they can uncoat.\n\nThis stage of viral replication can be inhibited in two ways:\n# Using agents which mimic the virus-associated protein (VAP) and bind to the cellular receptors. This may include VAP [[anti-idiotypic]] [[antibodies]], natural [[ligand]]s of the receptor and anti-receptor antibodies.{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}\n# Using agents which mimic the cellular receptor and bind to the VAP. This includes anti-VAP [[antibody|antibodies]], receptor anti-idiotypic antibodies, extraneous receptor and synthetic receptor mimics.\n\nThis strategy of designing drugs can be very expensive, and since the process of generating anti-idiotypic antibodies is partly trial and error, it can be a relatively slow process until an adequate molecule is produced.\n\n====Entry inhibitor====\nA very early stage of viral infection is [[viral entry]], when the virus attaches to and enters the host cell. A number of \"entry-inhibiting\" or \"entry-blocking\" drugs are being developed to fight HIV. HIV most heavily targets the immune system's white blood cells known as \"helper T cells\", and identifies these target cells through T-cell surface receptors designated \"[[CD4]]\" and \"[[CCR5]]\". Attempts to interfere with the binding of HIV with the CD4 receptor have failed to stop HIV from infecting helper T cells, but research continues on trying to interfere with the binding of HIV to the CCR5 receptor in hopes that it will be more effective.\n\nHIV infects a cell through fusion with the cell membrane, which requires two different cellular molecular participants, CD4 and a chemokine receptor (differing depending on the cell type). Approaches to blocking this virus/cell fusion have shown some promise in preventing entry of the virus into a cell. At least one of these entry inhibitors\u2014a biomimetic peptide called [[Enfuvirtide]], or the brand name Fuzeon\u2014has received FDA approval and has been in use for some time. Potentially, one of the benefits from the use of an effective entry-blocking or entry-inhibiting agent is that it potentially may not only prevent the spread of the virus within an infected individual but also the spread from an infected to an uninfected individual.\n\nOne possible advantage of the therapeutic approach of blocking viral entry (as opposed to the currently dominant approach of viral enzyme inhibition) is that it may prove more difficult for the virus to develop resistance to this therapy than for the virus to mutate or evolve its enzymatic protocols.\n\n====Uncoating inhibitor====\nInhibitors of uncoating have also been investigated.<ref name=\"pmid10325536\">{{cite journal |author=Bishop NE |title=Examination of potential inhibitors of hepatitis A virus uncoating |journal=Intervirology |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=261\u201371 |year=1998 |pmid=10325536 |doi= 10.1159/000024948}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid1850030\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Almela MJ, Gonz\u00e1lez ME, Carrasco L |title=Inhibitors of poliovirus uncoating efficiently block the early membrane permeabilization induced by virus particles |journal=J.

This pocket is similar in most strains of rhinoviruses and [[enterovirus]]es, which can cause diarrhea, [[meningitis]], [[conjunctivitis]], and [[encephalitis]].\n\nSome scientists are making the case that a vaccine against rhinoviruses, the predominant cause of the common cold, is achievable.\nVaccines that combine dozens of varieties of rhinovirus at once are effective in stimulating antiviral antibodies in mice and monkeys, researchers have reported in [[Nature Communications]] in 2016.\n\nRhinoviruses are the most common cause of the common cold; other viruses such as [[respiratory syncytial virus]], [[parainfluenza virus]] and [[adenoviruses]] can cause them too. Rhinoviruses also exacerbate asthma attacks. Although rhinoviruses come in many varieties, they do not drift to the same degree that influenza viruses do. A mixture of 50 inactivated rhinovirus types should be able to stimulate neutralizing antibodies against all of them to some degree.\n\n===During viral synthesis===\nA second approach is to target the processes that synthesize virus components after a virus invades a cell.\n\n====Reverse transcription====\nOne way of doing this is to develop [[nucleotide]] or [[nucleoside]] analogues that look like the building blocks of [[RNA]] or [[DNA]], but deactivate the enzymes that synthesize the RNA or DNA once the analogue is incorporated. This approach is more commonly associated with the inhibition of [[reverse transcriptase]] (RNA to DNA) than with \"normal\" transcriptase (DNA to RNA).\n\nThe first successful antiviral, [[aciclovir]], is a nucleoside analogue, and is effective against herpesvirus infections. The first antiviral drug to be approved for treating HIV, [[zidovudine]] (AZT), is also a nucleoside analogue.\n\nAn improved knowledge of the action of reverse transcriptase has led to better nucleoside analogues to treat HIV infections. One of these drugs, [[lamivudine]], has been approved to treat hepatitis B, which uses reverse transcriptase as part of its replication process. Researchers have gone further and developed inhibitors that do not look like nucleosides, but can still block reverse transcriptase.\n\nAnother target being considered for HIV antivirals include [[RNase H]]\u2014which is a component of reverse transcriptase that splits the synthesized DNA from the original viral RNA.\n\n====Integrase====\nAnother target is [[integrase]], which integrate the synthesized DNA into the host cell genome.\n\n====Transcription====\nOnce a virus genome becomes operational in a host cell, it then generates [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) molecules that direct the synthesis of viral proteins. Production of mRNA is initiated by proteins known as [[transcription factor]]s. Several antivirals are now being designed to block attachment of transcription factors to viral DNA.\n\n====Translation/antisense====\nGenomics has not only helped find targets for many antivirals, it has provided the basis for an entirely new type of drug, based on \"antisense\" molecules. These are segments of DNA or RNA that are designed as complementary molecule to critical sections of viral genomes, and the binding of these antisense segments to these target sections blocks the operation of those genomes. A phosphorothioate antisense drug named [[fomivirsen]] has been introduced, used to treat opportunistic eye infections in AIDS patients caused by [[cytomegalovirus]], and other antisense antivirals are in development. An antisense structural type that has proven especially valuable in research is [[morpholino]] antisense.\n\nMorpholino oligos have been used to experimentally suppress many viral types:\n* [[calicivirus]]es<ref name=\"pmid11763348\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Stein DA, Skilling DE, Iversen PL, Smith AW |title=Inhibition of Vesivirus infections in mammalian tissue culture with antisense morpholino oligomers |journal=Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=317\u201325 |year=2001|pmid=11763348 |doi=10.1089/108729001753231696}}</ref>\n* [[flavivirus]]es (including [[WNV]])<ref name=\"pmid15795246\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Deas | first1 = T.

'''DRACO''' effects cell death via one of the last steps in the apoptosis pathway in which complexes containing intracellular apoptosis signalling molecules simultaneously bind multiple [[Caspase|procaspases]].

Researchers are working to extend the range of antivirals to other families of pathogens.\n\nDesigning safe and effective antiviral drugs is difficult because viruses use the host's cells to replicate. This makes it difficult to find targets for the drug that would interfere with the virus without also harming the host organism's cells. Moreover, the major difficulty in developing vaccines and anti-viral drugs is due to viral variation.\n\nThe emergence of antivirals is the product of a greatly expanded knowledge of the genetic and molecular function of organisms, allowing biomedical researchers to understand the structure and function of viruses, major advances in the techniques for finding new drugs, and the pressure placed on the medical profession to deal with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ([[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]).\n\nThe first experimental antivirals were developed in the 1960s, mostly to deal with [[herpes simplex virus|herpes viruses]], and were found using traditional [[trial-and-error]] drug discovery methods. Researchers grew cultures of cells and infected them with the target virus. They then introduced into the cultures chemicals which they thought might inhibit viral activity and observed whether the level of virus in the cultures rose or fell. Chemicals that seemed to have an effect were selected for closer study.\n\nThis was a very time-consuming, hit-or-miss procedure, and in the absence of a good knowledge of how the target virus worked, it was not efficient in discovering effective antivirals which had few [[adverse effect|side effect]]s. Only in the 1980s, when the full [[genetic sequence]]s of viruses began to be unraveled, did researchers begin to learn how viruses worked in detail, and exactly what chemicals were needed to thwart their reproductive cycle.\n\n==Virus life cycle==\n[[Virus]]es consist of a [[genome]] and sometimes a few [[enzyme]]s stored in a capsule made of [[protein]] (called a [[capsid]]), and sometimes covered with a [[lipid]] layer (sometimes called an 'envelope'). Viruses cannot reproduce on their own and instead propagate by subjugating a host cell to produce copies of themselves, thus producing the next generation.\n\nResearchers working on such \"[[rational drug design]]\" strategies for developing antivirals have tried to attack viruses at every stage of their life cycles.

For instance, public schools require students to receive vaccinations (termed \"vaccination schedule\") for viruses and bacteria such as [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]], and [[tetanus]] (DTaP), [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[rubella]] (MMR), [[varicella]] (chickenpox), [[hepatitis B]], [[rotavirus]], [[polio]], and more. Private institutions might require annual influenza vaccination. The [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] has estimated that routine immunization of newborns prevents about 42,000 deaths and 20 million cases of disease each year, saving about $13.6 billion.<ref>Center for Disease Control.

Parents can also cite religious reasons to avoid public school vaccination mandates, but this reduces herd immunity and increases risk of viral infection.<ref name=\"HDL\" />\n\n====Limitations of vaccines====\n[[Vaccine]]s bolster the body's immune system to better attack viruses in the \"complete particle\" stage, outside of the organism's cells. They traditionally consist of an attenuated (a live weakened) or inactivated (killed) version of the virus. These vaccines can, in very rare cases, harm the host by inadvertently infecting the host with a full-blown viral occupancy {{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}. Recently \"subunit\" vaccines have been devised that consist strictly of protein targets from the pathogen. They stimulate the [[immune system]] without doing serious harm to the host{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}. In either case, when the real pathogen attacks the subject, the immune system responds to it quickly and blocks it.\n\nVaccines are very effective on stable viruses but are of limited use in treating a patient who has already been infected. They are also difficult to successfully deploy against rapidly mutating viruses, such as [[influenza]] (the vaccine for which is updated every year) and [[HIV]]. Antiviral drugs are particularly useful in these cases.\n\n====Antiretroviral therapy as HIV prevention====\nFollowing the [https://hptn.org/research/studies/hptn052 HPTN 052 study] and [http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2533066 PARTNER] study, there is significant evidence to demonstrate that antiretroviral drugs inhibit transmission when the HIV virus in the person living with HIV has been undetectable for 6 months or longer.\n\n=== Public policy ===\n'''Use and distribution'''\n\nGuidelines regarding viral diagnoses and treatments change frequently and limit quality care.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kunin|first1=Marina|last2=Engelhard|first2=Dan|last3=Thomas|first3=Shane|last4=Ashworth|first4=Mark|last5=Piterman|first5=Leon|title=Challenges of the Pandemic Response in Primary Care during Pre-Vaccination Period: A Qualitative Study|journal=Israel Journal of Health Policy Research|date=15 October 2015|volume=4|issue=1|pages=32|doi=10.1186/s13584-015-0028-5|pmid=26473026|pmc=4606524}}</ref> Even when physicians diagnose older patients with influenza, use of antiviral treatment can be low.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lindegren|first1=Mary Louise|last2=Griffin|first2=Marie R.|last3=Williams|first3=John V.|last4=Edwards|first4=Kathryn M.|last5=Zhu|first5=Yuwei|last6=Mitchel|first6=Ed|last7=Fry|first7=Alicia M.|last8=Schaffner|first8=William|last9=Talbot|first9=H.

During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009\u20132010, guidelines for SNS use by local health departments was unclear, revealing gaps in antiviral planning.<ref name=NACCHO/> For example, local health departments that received antivirals from the SNS did not have transparent guidance on the use of the treatments. The gap made it difficult to create plans and policies for their use and future availabilities, causing delays in treatment.\n\n==Anti-viral targeting==\nThe general idea behind modern antiviral drug design is to identify viral proteins, or parts of proteins, that can be disabled. These \"targets\" should generally be as unlike any proteins or parts of proteins in humans as possible, to reduce the likelihood of side effects. The targets should also be common across many strains of a virus, or even among different species of virus in the same family, so a single drug will have broad effectiveness. For example, a researcher might target a critical enzyme synthesized by the virus, but not by the patient, that is common across strains, and see what can be done to interfere with its operation.\n\nOnce targets are identified, candidate drugs can be selected, either from drugs already known to have appropriate effects or by actually designing the candidate at the molecular level with a [[computer-aided design]] program.\n\nThe target proteins can be manufactured in the lab for testing with candidate treatments by [[genetic engineering|inserting the gene]] that synthesizes the target protein into [[bacteria]] or other kinds of cells. The cells are then cultured for mass production of the protein, which can then be exposed to various treatment candidates and evaluated with \"rapid screening\" technologies.\n\n==Approaches by life cycle stage==\n===Before cell entry===\nOne anti-viral strategy is to interfere with the ability of a virus to infiltrate a target cell. The virus must go through a sequence of steps to do this, beginning with binding to a specific \"[[receptor (biology)|receptor]]\" molecule on the surface of the host cell and ending with the virus \"uncoating\" inside the cell and releasing its contents. Viruses that have a lipid envelope must also fuse their envelope with the target cell, or with a vesicle that transports them into the cell before they can uncoat.\n\nThis stage of viral replication can be inhibited in two ways:\n# Using agents which mimic the virus-associated protein (VAP) and bind to the cellular receptors. This may include VAP [[anti-idiotypic]] [[antibodies]], natural [[ligand]]s of the receptor and anti-receptor antibodies.{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}\n# Using agents which mimic the cellular receptor and bind to the VAP. This includes anti-VAP [[antibody|antibodies]], receptor anti-idiotypic antibodies, extraneous receptor and synthetic receptor mimics.\n\nThis strategy of designing drugs can be very expensive, and since the process of generating anti-idiotypic antibodies is partly trial and error, it can be a relatively slow process until an adequate molecule is produced.\n\n====Entry inhibitor====\nA very early stage of viral infection is [[viral entry]], when the virus attaches to and enters the host cell. A number of \"entry-inhibiting\" or \"entry-blocking\" drugs are being developed to fight HIV. HIV most heavily targets the immune system's white blood cells known as \"helper T cells\", and identifies these target cells through T-cell surface receptors designated \"[[CD4]]\" and \"[[CCR5]]\". Attempts to interfere with the binding of HIV with the CD4 receptor have failed to stop HIV from infecting helper T cells, but research continues on trying to interfere with the binding of HIV to the CCR5 receptor in hopes that it will be more effective.\n\nHIV infects a cell through fusion with the cell membrane, which requires two different cellular molecular participants, CD4 and a chemokine receptor (differing depending on the cell type). Approaches to blocking this virus/cell fusion have shown some promise in preventing entry of the virus into a cell. At least one of these entry inhibitors\u2014a biomimetic peptide called [[Enfuvirtide]], or the brand name Fuzeon\u2014has received FDA approval and has been in use for some time. Potentially, one of the benefits from the use of an effective entry-blocking or entry-inhibiting agent is that it potentially may not only prevent the spread of the virus within an infected individual but also the spread from an infected to an uninfected individual.\n\nOne possible advantage of the therapeutic approach of blocking viral entry (as opposed to the currently dominant approach of viral enzyme inhibition) is that it may prove more difficult for the virus to develop resistance to this therapy than for the virus to mutate or evolve its enzymatic protocols.\n\n====Uncoating inhibitor====\nInhibitors of uncoating have also been investigated.<ref name=\"pmid10325536\">{{cite journal |author=Bishop NE |title=Examination of potential inhibitors of hepatitis A virus uncoating |journal=Intervirology |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=261\u201371 |year=1998 |pmid=10325536 |doi= 10.1159/000024948}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid1850030\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Almela MJ, Gonz\u00e1lez ME, Carrasco L |title=Inhibitors of poliovirus uncoating efficiently block the early membrane permeabilization induced by virus particles |journal=J.

This pocket is similar in most strains of rhinoviruses and [[enterovirus]]es, which can cause diarrhea, [[meningitis]], [[conjunctivitis]], and [[encephalitis]].\n\nSome scientists are making the case that a vaccine against rhinoviruses, the predominant cause of the common cold, is achievable.\nVaccines that combine dozens of varieties of rhinovirus at once are effective in stimulating antiviral antibodies in mice and monkeys, researchers have reported in [[Nature Communications]] in 2016.\n\nRhinoviruses are the most common cause of the common cold; other viruses such as [[respiratory syncytial virus]], [[parainfluenza virus]] and [[adenoviruses]] can cause them too. Rhinoviruses also exacerbate asthma attacks. Although rhinoviruses come in many varieties, they do not drift to the same degree that influenza viruses do. A mixture of 50 inactivated rhinovirus types should be able to stimulate neutralizing antibodies against all of them to some degree.\n\n===During viral synthesis===\nA second approach is to target the processes that synthesize virus components after a virus invades a cell.\n\n====Reverse transcription====\nOne way of doing this is to develop [[nucleotide]] or [[nucleoside]] analogues that look like the building blocks of [[RNA]] or [[DNA]], but deactivate the enzymes that synthesize the RNA or DNA once the analogue is incorporated. This approach is more commonly associated with the inhibition of [[reverse transcriptase]] (RNA to DNA) than with \"normal\" transcriptase (DNA to RNA).\n\nThe first successful antiviral, [[aciclovir]], is a nucleoside analogue, and is effective against herpesvirus infections. The first antiviral drug to be approved for treating HIV, [[zidovudine]] (AZT), is also a nucleoside analogue.\n\nAn improved knowledge of the action of reverse transcriptase has led to better nucleoside analogues to treat HIV infections. One of these drugs, [[lamivudine]], has been approved to treat hepatitis B, which uses reverse transcriptase as part of its replication process. Researchers have gone further and developed inhibitors that do not look like nucleosides, but can still block reverse transcriptase.\n\nAnother target being considered for HIV antivirals include [[RNase H]]\u2014which is a component of reverse transcriptase that splits the synthesized DNA from the original viral RNA.\n\n====Integrase====\nAnother target is [[integrase]], which integrate the synthesized DNA into the host cell genome.\n\n====Transcription====\nOnce a virus genome becomes operational in a host cell, it then generates [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) molecules that direct the synthesis of viral proteins. Production of mRNA is initiated by proteins known as [[transcription factor]]s. Several antivirals are now being designed to block attachment of transcription factors to viral DNA.\n\n====Translation/antisense====\nGenomics has not only helped find targets for many antivirals, it has provided the basis for an entirely new type of drug, based on \"antisense\" molecules. These are segments of DNA or RNA that are designed as complementary molecule to critical sections of viral genomes, and the binding of these antisense segments to these target sections blocks the operation of those genomes. A phosphorothioate antisense drug named [[fomivirsen]] has been introduced, used to treat opportunistic eye infections in AIDS patients caused by [[cytomegalovirus]], and other antisense antivirals are in development. An antisense structural type that has proven especially valuable in research is [[morpholino]] antisense.\n\nMorpholino oligos have been used to experimentally suppress many viral types:\n* [[calicivirus]]es<ref name=\"pmid11763348\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Stein DA, Skilling DE, Iversen PL, Smith AW |title=Inhibition of Vesivirus infections in mammalian tissue culture with antisense morpholino oligomers |journal=Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=317\u201325 |year=2001|pmid=11763348 |doi=10.1089/108729001753231696}}</ref>\n* [[flavivirus]]es (including [[WNV]])<ref name=\"pmid15795246\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Deas | first1 = T.

In contrast, uninfected [[mammalian]] cells generally produce dsRNA helices of fewer than 24 [[base pairs]] during transcription. '''[[DRACO]]''' ('''[[RNA#Double-stranded RNA|double-stranded RNA]] activated [[caspase]] [[oligomer]]izer''') is a group of experimental antiviral drugs initially developed at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In cell culture, DRACO was reported to have broad-spectrum efficacy against many infectious viruses, including [[Dengue virus|dengue flavivirus]], Amapari and Tacaribe [[arenavirus]], Guama [[Bunyaviridae|bunyavirus]], [[H1N1 influenza]] and [[rhinovirus]], and was additionally found effective against influenza ''in vivo'' in weanling mice. It was reported to induce rapid [[apoptosis]] selectively in virus-infected mammalian cells, while leaving uninfected cells [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3144912/ unharmed]. '''DRACO''' effects cell death via one of the last steps in the apoptosis pathway in which complexes containing intracellular apoptosis signalling molecules simultaneously bind multiple [[Caspase|procaspases]]. The procaspases transactivate via cleavage, activate additional caspases in the cascade, and cleave a variety of cellular proteins, thereby killing the cell.\n\n===Assembly===\n[[Rifampicin]] acts at the assembly phase.<ref name=\"pmid8289340\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sodeik B, Griffiths G, Ericsson M, Moss B, Doms RW |title=Assembly of vaccinia virus: effects of rifampin on the intracellular distribution of viral protein p65 |journal=J.

Two drugs named [[zanamivir]] (Relenza) and [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu) that have been recently introduced to treat influenza prevent the release of viral particles by blocking a molecule named [[neuraminidase]] that is found on the surface of flu viruses, and also seems to be constant across a wide range of flu strains.\n\n==Immune system stimulation==\nRather than attacking viruses directly, a second category of tactics for fighting viruses involves encouraging the body's immune system to attack them. Some antivirals of this sort do not focus on a specific pathogen, instead stimulating the immune system to attack a range of pathogens.\n\nOne of the best-known of this class of drugs are [[interferon]]s, which inhibit viral synthesis in infected cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Samuel CE |title=Antiviral Actions of Interferons |journal=Clin.
