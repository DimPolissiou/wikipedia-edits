It was named after [[Thomas Saltus Lubbock]], former Texas Ranger and brother of [[Francis Lubbock]], governor of Texas during the Civil War.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdl04|title=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}</ref> As early as 1884, a [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. post office]] existed in [[Yellow House Canyon]]. A small town, known as Old Lubbock, Lubbock, or North Town, was established about three miles to the east. In 1890, the original Lubbock merged with Monterey, another small town south of the canyon. The new town adopted the Lubbock name. The merger included moving the original Lubbock's [[Nicolett Hotel (Lubbock, Texas)|Nicolett Hotel]] across the canyon on rollers to the new townsite. Lubbock became the county seat in 1891,<ref>[[Paul H. Carlson]], \"The Nicolett Hotel and the Founding of Lubbock\", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 90 (2014), pp. 8-9, 11.</ref> and was incorporated on March 16, 1909. In the same year, the first railroad train arrived.\n\nTexas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) was founded in Lubbock in 1923. A separate university, [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]], opened as Texas Tech University School of Medicine in 1969. Both universities are now overseen by the [[Texas Tech University System]], after it was established in 1996 and based in Lubbock. [[Lubbock Christian University]], founded in 1957, and [[Sunset International Bible Institute]], both affiliated with the [[Churches of Christ]], have their main campuses in the city. [[South Plains College]] and [[Wayland Baptist University]] operate branch campuses in Lubbock.\n\nAt one time, Lubbock was home to [[Reese Air Force Base]], located {{convert|6|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the city. It was established in August 1941, during the defense build-up prior to [[World War II]] (1941-1945), by the [[United States Department of War]] and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as Lubbock Army Airfield. It served the old [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]], and later the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] (USAF), after reorganization and establishment in 1947. The USAF base's primary mission throughout its existence was pilot training. The base was closed 30 September 1997, after being selected for closure by the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] Commission in 1995, and is now a research and business park called [[Reese Technology Center]].\n\nThe city is home to the [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]], part of the [[Museum of Texas Tech University]]. The landmark is an archaeological and natural-history preserve at the northern edge of the city. It shows evidence of almost 12,000 years of human occupation in the region. The [[National Ranching Heritage Center]], also part of the Museum of Texas Tech University, houses historic ranch-related structures from the region.\n\nDuring World War II, airmen cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Lubbock on training flights. The town served as a stand-in for the British for Cork, Ireland, which was the same distance from London, England, as Lubbock is from Terrell.\n\nIn August 1951, a V-shaped formation of lights was seen over the city. The \"[[Lubbock Lights]]\" series of sightings received national publicity and is regarded as one of the first great \"[[UFO]]\" cases. The sightings were considered credible because they were witnessed by several respected science professors at Texas Technological College and were photographed by a Texas Tech student. The photographs were reprinted nationwide in newspapers and in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''. [[Project Blue Book]], the USAF's official investigation of the UFO mystery, concluded the photographs were not a hoax and showed genuine objects, but dismissed the UFOs as being either \"night-flying moths\" or a type of bird called a [[plover]] reflected in the nighttime glow of Lubbock's new street lights.\n\nIn 1960, the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] reported Lubbock's population as 128,691 and area as {{convert|75.0|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"census\"/>\n\nOn May 11, 1970, the [[Lubbock Tornado]] struck the city. Twenty-six people died, and damage was estimated at $125 million. The [[Metro Tower (Lubbock)|Metro Tower]] (NTS Building), then known as the Great Plains Life Building, at {{convert|274|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height, is believed to have been the tallest building ever to survive a direct hit from an [[Fujita scale|F5]] tornado.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lub/climate/Local_interest_events/LUB_tornado/lubtor.html |title=Lubbock, Texas|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061009180854/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lub/climate/Local_interest_events/LUB_tornado/lubtor.html |archivedate = October 9, 2006}}</ref> Then-mayor [[Jim Granberry]] and the Lubbock City Council, which included Granberry's successor as mayor, [[Morris W.

[[Interstate 27 (Texas)|Interstate 27]] (the former Avenue H) links the city to [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]] and [[Interstate 40 (Texas)|Interstate 40]], a transcontinental route. I-27 was completed through the city in 1992 (it originally terminated just north of downtown). Other major highways include [[U.S. Highway 62 (Texas)|US 62]] and [[U.S. Highway 82 in Texas|US 82]], which run concurrently (except for 4th Street (82) and 19th Street (62)) through the city east\u2013west as the Marsha Sharp Freeway, 19th Street (62 only), 4th Street/Parkway Drive (82 only) and [[Idalou, Texas|Idalou]] Highway. [[U.S. Highway 84 (Texas)|US 84]] (Avenue Q/[[Slaton, Texas|Slaton]] Highway/[[Clovis, New Mexico|Clovis]] Road) is also another east\u2013west route running NW/SE diagonally. [[U.S. Highway 87 (Texas)|US Highway 87]] runs between [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]] and Amarillo and follows I-27 concurrently. [[Texas State Highway 114|State Highway 114]] runs east\u2013west, following US 62/82 on the east before going its own way. Lubbock is circled by [[State Highway Loop 289 (Texas)|Loop 289]], which suffers from traffic congestion despite being a potential bypass around the city, which is the reason behind I-27 and Brownfield Highway being built through the city to have freeway traffic flow effectively inside the loop.\n\nThe city is set up on a simple [[grid plan]]. In the heart of the city, numbered streets run east\u2013west and lettered avenues run north\u2013south \u2013 the grid begins at Avenue A in the east and First Street in the north. North of First Street, city planners chose to name streets alphabetically from the south to the north after colleges and universities. The north\u2013south avenues run from A to Y. What would be Avenue Z is actually University Avenue, since it runs along the east side of Texas Tech. Beyond that, the A-to-Z convention resumes, using US cities found east of the Mississippi (e.g. Akron Avenue, Boston Avenue, Canton Avenue). Again, the Z name is not used, with Slide Road appearing in its place.\n\n====Rail service====\nLubbock currently does not provide [[intercity rail]] service, although various proposals have been presented over the years to remedy this. One, the ''[[Caprock Chief]]'', would have seen daily service as part of a [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], Texas\u2014[[Denver]], Colorado service, but it failed to gain interest.<ref>{{cite news | title=Lubbock officials backing plans for Amtrak rail service | url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/080201/tex_amtrakrail.shtml | date=August 2, 2001 | work=[[Amarillo Globe-News]] | accessdate=2008-05-14 | first=Chris | last=Van Wagenen | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000244/http://amarillo.com/stories/080201/tex_amtrakrail.shtml | archive-date=June 4, 2011 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Lubbock is served by the BNSF Railway company, Plainsman Switching Company (PSC), and West Texas & Lubbock Railway (WTLC).

Options exist for transloading a variety of materials on the line, from wind-turbine parts to steel shafts. PSC handles many commodities such as cottonseed, cottonseed oil, cottonseed meal, cottonseed hulls, milo, corn, wheat, pinto beans, sand, rock, lumber, nonperishable food items, chemicals, paper products, brick, and bagging material, and can also store cars. WTLC interchanges with BNSF (also with UP through a UP-BNSF Haulage agreement) in Lubbock. WTLC has a yard on the west side of Lubbock, where they switch cars to go down their line to Levelland or to Brownfield. WTLC handles commodities of grains, chemicals, sands, peanuts, lumber, etc.\n\n====Airports====\n{{See also|Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport}}\n[[File:Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport IMG 0260.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport]]]]\nThe city's air services are provided by [[Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport]], which is named for the Lubbock businessman who became [[lieutenant governor]] and governor of Texas. It is on the city's northeast side. The airport is the eighth-busiest airport in Texas. Lubbock Preston Smith Airport also plays host as a major hub to FedEx's feeder planes that serve cities around Lubbock.\n\n====Intercity bus service====\n[[Greyhound Lines]] operates the Lubbock Station at 801 Broadway, just east of the Lubbock County Courthouse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=681791 |title=Greyhound |publisher=Greyhound |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122230451/https://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=681791 |archivedate=November 22, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Public transportation====\n{{See also|Citibus (Lubbock)}}\nPublic transportation is provided by [[Citibus (Lubbock)|Citibus]], a bus transit system running Monday through Saturday every week with a transit center hub in downtown. It runs bus routes throughout the city, with the main routes converging at the Downtown Transfer Plaza, which also houses the Greyhound bus terminal. Citibus has been in continual service since 1971, when the city of Lubbock took over public transit operations. The paratransit system is called Citiaccess.\n\nCitibus' six [[diesel-electric hybrid bus]]es have begun service on city routes. Managers hope the buses will use 60% of the fuel their older, larger versions consume in moving customers across the city. The buses seat 23 passengers, can support full-sized [[wheelchair]]s, and will run on all but two city-based routes.\n\n====Modal characteristics====\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, 80.9% of working Lubbock (city) residents commuted by driving alone, 12.9% carpooled, 1% used public transportation, and 1.5% walked. About 1.5% used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. About 2.3% worked at home.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Census Reporter|title=Means of Transportation to Work by Age|accessdate=May 7, 2018|url=https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&geo_ids=16000US4845000&primary_geo_id=16000US4845000}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, 7.3% of Lubbock households were without a car, which decreased to 5.6% in 2016.

Previously, Milwaukee was a 4-mile dirt road on farm land with hardly any traffic a mile or more from major development. With growth headed westward, the city allocated nearly $20 million to convert the road into a seven-lane concrete thoroughfare. In 2004, the city funded the project and other developments to come by establishing a new fund that tapped part of the franchise fees received. As of 2018, more than $124 million in street construction has been possible from the fund, including Slide Road, 98th Street, Indiana Avenue, and the last phases of the [[U.S. Route 82 in Texas|Marsha Sharp Freeway]]. Public Works Director Wood Franklin said Milwaukee Avenue was conceived on the \"build it and they will come\" theory. Marc McDougal, then the mayor of Lubbock, described the project as a well calculated risk that subsequently greatly benefited the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/20180728/leaders-say-lubbocks-milwaukee-avenue-took-creative-funding-project-of-similar-scope-not-foreseen|title=Leaders say Lubbock's Milwaukee Avenue took creative funding, project of similar scope not foreseen|author=Matt Dotray|date=July 28, 2018|newspaper=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==<!--consensus reached to standardize this heading per WP:WikiProject Cities/US Guideline --><!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\u2022 Only people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here.

It was named after [[Thomas Saltus Lubbock]], former Texas Ranger and brother of [[Francis Lubbock]], governor of Texas during the Civil War.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdl04|title=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}</ref> As early as 1884, a [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. post office]] existed in [[Yellow House Canyon]]. A small town, known as Old Lubbock, Lubbock, or North Town, was established about three miles to the east. In 1890, the original Lubbock merged with Monterey, another small town south of the canyon. The new town adopted the Lubbock name. The merger included moving the original Lubbock's [[Nicolett Hotel (Lubbock, Texas)|Nicolett Hotel]] across the canyon on rollers to the new townsite. Lubbock became the county seat in 1891,<ref>[[Paul H. Carlson]], \"The Nicolett Hotel and the Founding of Lubbock\", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 90 (2014), pp. 8-9, 11.</ref> and was incorporated on March 16, 1909. In the same year, the first railroad train arrived.\n\nTexas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) was founded in Lubbock in 1923. A separate university, [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]], opened as Texas Tech University School of Medicine in 1969. Both universities are now overseen by the [[Texas Tech University System]], after it was established in 1996 and based in Lubbock. [[Lubbock Christian University]], founded in 1957, and [[Sunset International Bible Institute]], both affiliated with the [[Churches of Christ]], have their main campuses in the city. [[South Plains College]] and [[Wayland Baptist University]] operate branch campuses in Lubbock.\n\nAt one time, Lubbock was home to [[Reese Air Force Base]], located {{convert|6|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the city. It was established in August 1941, during the defense build-up prior to [[World War II]] (1941-1945), by the [[United States Department of War]] and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as Lubbock Army Airfield. It served the old [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]], and later the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] (USAF), after reorganization and establishment in 1947. The USAF base's primary mission throughout its existence was pilot training. The base was closed 30 September 1997, after being selected for closure by the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] Commission in 1995, and is now a research and business park called [[Reese Technology Center]].\n\nThe city is home to the [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]], part of the [[Museum of Texas Tech University]]. The landmark is an archaeological and natural-history preserve at the northern edge of the city. It shows evidence of almost 12,000 years of human occupation in the region. The [[National Ranching Heritage Center]], also part of the Museum of Texas Tech University, houses historic ranch-related structures from the region.\n\nDuring World War II, airmen cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Lubbock on training flights. The town served as a stand-in for the British for Cork, Ireland, which was the same distance from London, England, as Lubbock is from Terrell.\n\nIn August 1951, a V-shaped formation of lights was seen over the city. The \"[[Lubbock Lights]]\" series of sightings received national publicity and is regarded as one of the first great \"[[UFO]]\" cases. The sightings were considered credible because they were witnessed by several respected science professors at Texas Technological College and were photographed by a Texas Tech student. The photographs were reprinted nationwide in newspapers and in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''. [[Project Blue Book]], the USAF's official investigation of the UFO mystery, concluded the photographs were not a hoax and showed genuine objects, but dismissed the UFOs as being either \"night-flying moths\" or a type of bird called a [[plover]] reflected in the nighttime glow of Lubbock's new street lights.\n\nIn 1960, the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] reported Lubbock's population as 128,691 and area as {{convert|75.0|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"census\"/>\n\nOn May 11, 1970, the [[Lubbock Tornado]] struck the city. Twenty-six people died, and damage was estimated at $125 million. The [[Metro Tower (Lubbock)|Metro Tower]] (NTS Building), then known as the Great Plains Life Building, at {{convert|274|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height, is believed to have been the tallest building ever to survive a direct hit from an [[Fujita scale|F5]] tornado.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lub/climate/Local_interest_events/LUB_tornado/lubtor.html |title=Lubbock, Texas|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061009180854/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lub/climate/Local_interest_events/LUB_tornado/lubtor.html |archivedate = October 9, 2006}}</ref> Then-mayor [[Jim Granberry]] and the Lubbock City Council, which included Granberry's successor as mayor, [[Morris W.

The historians [[Paul H. Carlson]], Donald R. Abbe, and David J. Murrah co-authored ''Lubbock and the South Plains.''\n\nOn August 12, 2008, the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce announced they would lead the effort to get enough signatures to have a vote on allowing county-wide packaged alcohol sales.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chamber to Lead Alcohol Petition Effort |url=http://www.myfoxlubbock.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=7191012&version=2&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=1.1.1&sflg=1 |publisher=My Fox Lubbock |accessdate=2009-05-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714142817/http://www.myfoxlubbock.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=7191012&version=2&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=1.1.1&sflg=1 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 }}</ref> The petition effort was successful and the question was put to the voters.

[[Interstate 27 (Texas)|Interstate 27]] (the former Avenue H) links the city to [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]] and [[Interstate 40 (Texas)|Interstate 40]], a transcontinental route. I-27 was completed through the city in 1992 (it originally terminated just north of downtown). Other major highways include [[U.S. Highway 62 (Texas)|US 62]] and [[U.S. Highway 82 in Texas|US 82]], which run concurrently (except for 4th Street (82) and 19th Street (62)) through the city east\u2013west as the Marsha Sharp Freeway, 19th Street (62 only), 4th Street/Parkway Drive (82 only) and [[Idalou, Texas|Idalou]] Highway. [[U.S. Highway 84 (Texas)|US 84]] (Avenue Q/[[Slaton, Texas|Slaton]] Highway/[[Clovis, New Mexico|Clovis]] Road) is also another east\u2013west route running NW/SE diagonally. [[U.S. Highway 87 (Texas)|US Highway 87]] runs between [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]] and Amarillo and follows I-27 concurrently. [[Texas State Highway 114|State Highway 114]] runs east\u2013west, following US 62/82 on the east before going its own way. Lubbock is circled by [[State Highway Loop 289 (Texas)|Loop 289]], which suffers from traffic congestion despite being a potential bypass around the city, which is the reason behind I-27 and Brownfield Highway being built through the city to have freeway traffic flow effectively inside the loop.\n\nThe city is set up on a simple [[grid plan]]. In the heart of the city, numbered streets run east\u2013west and lettered avenues run north\u2013south \u2013 the grid begins at Avenue A in the east and First Street in the north. North of First Street, city planners chose to name streets alphabetically from the south to the north after colleges and universities. The north\u2013south avenues run from A to Y. What would be Avenue Z is actually University Avenue, since it runs along the east side of Texas Tech. Beyond that, the A-to-Z convention resumes, using US cities found east of the Mississippi (e.g. Akron Avenue, Boston Avenue, Canton Avenue). Again, the Z name is not used, with Slide Road appearing in its place.\n\n====Rail service====\nLubbock currently does not provide [[intercity rail]] service, although various proposals have been presented over the years to remedy this. One, the ''[[Caprock Chief]]'', would have seen daily service as part of a [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], Texas\u2014[[Denver]], Colorado service, but it failed to gain interest.<ref>{{cite news | title=Lubbock officials backing plans for Amtrak rail service | url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/080201/tex_amtrakrail.shtml | date=August 2, 2001 | work=[[Amarillo Globe-News]] | accessdate=2008-05-14 | first=Chris | last=Van Wagenen | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000244/http://amarillo.com/stories/080201/tex_amtrakrail.shtml | archive-date=June 4, 2011 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Lubbock is served by the BNSF Railway company, Plainsman Switching Company (PSC), and West Texas & Lubbock Railway (WTLC).

Options exist for transloading a variety of materials on the line, from wind-turbine parts to steel shafts. PSC handles many commodities such as cottonseed, cottonseed oil, cottonseed meal, cottonseed hulls, milo, corn, wheat, pinto beans, sand, rock, lumber, nonperishable food items, chemicals, paper products, brick, and bagging material, and can also store cars. WTLC interchanges with BNSF (also with UP through a UP-BNSF Haulage agreement) in Lubbock. WTLC has a yard on the west side of Lubbock, where they switch cars to go down their line to Levelland or to Brownfield. WTLC handles commodities of grains, chemicals, sands, peanuts, lumber, etc.\n\n====Airports====\n{{See also|Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport}}\n[[File:Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport IMG 0260.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport]]]]\nThe city's air services are provided by [[Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport]], which is named for the Lubbock businessman who became [[lieutenant governor]] and governor of Texas. It is on the city's northeast side. The airport is the eighth-busiest airport in Texas. Lubbock Preston Smith Airport also plays host as a major hub to FedEx's feeder planes that serve cities around Lubbock.\n\n====Intercity bus service====\n[[Greyhound Lines]] operates the Lubbock Station at 801 Broadway, just east of the Lubbock County Courthouse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=681791 |title=Greyhound |publisher=Greyhound |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122230451/https://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=681791 |archivedate=November 22, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Public transportation====\n{{See also|Citibus (Lubbock)}}\nPublic transportation is provided by [[Citibus (Lubbock)|Citibus]], a bus transit system running Monday through Saturday every week with a transit center hub in downtown. It runs bus routes throughout the city, with the main routes converging at the Downtown Transfer Plaza, which also houses the Greyhound bus terminal. Citibus has been in continual service since 1971, when the city of Lubbock took over public transit operations. The paratransit system is called Citiaccess.\n\nCitibus' six [[diesel-electric hybrid bus]]es have begun service on city routes. Managers hope the buses will use 60% of the fuel their older, larger versions consume in moving customers across the city. The buses seat 23 passengers, can support full-sized [[wheelchair]]s, and will run on all but two city-based routes.\n\n====Modal characteristics====\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, 80.9% of working Lubbock (city) residents commuted by driving alone, 12.9% carpooled, 1% used public transportation, and 1.5% walked. About 1.5% used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. About 2.3% worked at home.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Census Reporter|title=Means of Transportation to Work by Age|accessdate=May 7, 2018|url=https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&geo_ids=16000US4845000&primary_geo_id=16000US4845000}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, 7.3% of Lubbock households were without a car, which decreased to 5.6% in 2016.

Previously, Milwaukee was a 4-mile dirt road on farm land with hardly any traffic a mile or more from major development. With growth headed westward, the city allocated nearly $20 million to convert the road into a seven-lane concrete thoroughfare. In 2004, the city funded the project and other developments to come by establishing a new fund that tapped part of the franchise fees received. As of 2018, more than $124 million in street construction has been possible from the fund, including Slide Road, 98th Street, Indiana Avenue, and the last phases of the [[U.S. Route 82 in Texas|Marsha Sharp Freeway]]. Public Works Director Wood Franklin said Milwaukee Avenue was conceived on the \"build it and they will come\" theory. Marc McDougal, then the mayor of Lubbock, described the project as a well calculated risk that subsequently greatly benefited the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/20180728/leaders-say-lubbocks-milwaukee-avenue-took-creative-funding-project-of-similar-scope-not-foreseen|title=Leaders say Lubbock's Milwaukee Avenue took creative funding, project of similar scope not foreseen|author=Matt Dotray|date=July 28, 2018|newspaper=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==<!--consensus reached to standardize this heading per WP:WikiProject Cities/US Guideline --><!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\u2022 Only people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here.

The battle was fought between elements of the British [[Channel Fleet]] and the French Atlantic Fleet, which were cruising in the region on separate missions. The British fleet, commanded by Admiral [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Lord Bridport]], was covering an [[Invasion of France (1795)|invasion convoy]] carrying a [[\u00c9migr\u00e9 armies of the French Revolutionary Wars|French Royalist]] army to invade [[Quiberon]], while the French under Vice-amiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] had sailed a week earlier to rescue a French convoy from attack by a British squadron. The French fleet had driven off the British squadron in a battle on 17 June known as [[Cornwallis's Retreat]], and were attempting to return to their base at [[Brest, France|Brest]] when Bridport's force of 14 [[ships of the line]] appeared on 22 June.\n\nVillaret, believing that the stronger British fleet would destroy his own 12 ships of the line, ordered his force to fall back to the inshore anchorage off Groix, hoping to take shelter in protected coastal waters. Several of his ships were too slow, falling behind so that early in the morning of 23 June the rearmost ships of his fleet were caught by the British vanguard, overhauled one by one and brought to battle. Although Villaret fought a determined rearguard action, three French ships were captured, all with very heavy casualties, and the remainder of the French fleet was left scattered across miles of coastline. In this position they were highly vulnerable to continued British attack, but after only a few hours' engagement, concerned that his ships might be wrecked on the rocky coastline, Bridport called off the action and allowed Villaret to regroup inshore and retreat to [[Lorient]].\n\nAlthough the battle was a British victory, there was criticism of Bridport's rapid withdrawal. British historians have subsequently considered that a unique opportunity to destroy the French Atlantic fleet had been lost. The [[Invasion of France (1795)|invasion at Quiberon]] ended in disaster a month later, although Bridport remained at sea in the region until September. The French fleet by contrast was trapped in the port of Lorient where food supplies ran out, forcing Villaret to discharge many of his ships' crews. As a result, most ships did not return to Brest until the winter and were consequently unable to threaten British control of the French coastline for the remainder of the year. Several French captains were court-martialled following the battle, with two dismissed from the Navy for disobeying orders.\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] had seen the French Atlantic Fleet, based principally at the [[Brittany|Breton]] harbour of [[Brest, France|Brest]], suffer a series of setbacks. The tense atmosphere in France following the [[French Revolution]] was reflected in the fleet, which suffered a mutiny in September 1793 followed by [[Reign of Terror|a purge]] of suspected anti-republicans which resulted in the death or imprisonment of a number of experienced commanders.<ref name=\"WJ59\">James, p. 59</ref><ref name=\"SW34\">Willis, p. 34</ref> In [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794|May 1794]], the French fleet sallied into the Atlantic to protect an incoming grain convoy from the [[United States]] and was attacked by the British [[Channel Fleet]] at the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], losing seven ships, although the convoy was saved. In the winter of 1794\u20131795, five more French ships were lost in a disastrous sortie in the middle of the Atlantic winter storm season known as the ''[[Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver]]''. By the spring of 1795, the British Channel Fleet was in the ascendancy, enforcing a distant [[blockade]] of the French fleet in Brest.<ref name=\"RG16\">Gardiner, ''Fleet Battle and Blockade'' p. 16</ref>\n\nIn May 1795, with much of the winter's damage repaired, the French commander [[Vice-amiral]] [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] sent a squadron of three [[ships of the line]] and several [[frigates]] under [[Contre-amiral]] [[Jean Gaspard Vence]] to [[Bordeaux]] with orders to escort a convoy of merchant ships carrying wine and brandy to Brest.<ref name=\"WLC255\">Clowes, p. 255</ref> On 8 June, as Vence's convoy passed the fortified island of [[Belle \u00cele]] on the southern Breton coast they were discovered by a British battle squadron of five ships of the line and two frigates under Vice-Admiral [[William Cornwallis]].<ref name=\"WLC256\">Clowes, p. 256</ref> Vence ordered his outnumbered ships to shelter under the batteries of Belle \u00cele, and after a brief skirmish Cornwallis withdrew his forces with eight captured merchant ships. While Cornwallis was escorting his prizes to the mouth of the Channel, Vence sailed out of the Belle \u00cele anchorage and discovered on 15 June that the main force of the Atlantic fleet had sailed to rescue him, a mission ordered by government over the objections of the fleet's officers that Vence would be able to easily extricate himself from the anchorage due to the proximity of the port of [[Lorient]].<ref name=\"WJ237-238\">James, pp. 237\u2013238</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 16 June Cornwallis returned to the region, hunting for Vence, and instead discovered Villaret de Joyeuse with an overwhelming force. This time Cornwallis was forced to retreat, heading into open water with the French fleet in pursuit. Cornwallis was hampered by the poor sailing of two of his squadron, and on the morning of 17 June the leading French ships were close enough to open fire on his rearguard.<ref name=\"WJ240\">James, p. 240</ref> Throughout the day the French vanguard kept up a distant but continual fire on the rearmost British ship [[HMS Mars (1794)|HMS ''Mars'']], until eventually the ship began to fall behind. In an effort to protect ''Mars'', Cornwallis interposed his 100-gun flagship [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|HMS ''Royal Sovereign'']] between the British squadron and the French force, its massive broadsides driving the French back.<ref name=\"WLC257\">Clowes, p. 257</ref> At the same time, Cornwallis had ordered the frigate [[HMS Phaeton (1782)|HMS ''Phaeton'']] to range ahead of his squadron making false signals announcing the imminent arrival of a British fleet. These signals, in combination with the coincidental appearance of unidentified sails to the north, caused Villaret to become so concerned that at 18:40 he called off pursuit and returned to the French coast, allowing Cornwallis to return to Britain without further incident. The engagement was subsequently known as [[Cornwallis's Retreat]].<ref name=\"WJ241\">James, p. 241</ref>\n\nUnbeknownst to either Villaret or Cornwallis, the British Channel Fleet was also at sea, having sailed from [[Spithead]] on 12 June with 14 ships of the line and 11 smaller vessels under the command of Admiral [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport]]. Bridport had been tasked with ensuring the safety of a convoy of transports, commanded by Commodore [[Sir John Borlase Warren]], which carried a [[\u00c9migr\u00e9 armies of the French Revolutionary Wars|French Royalist]] army to [[Quiberon]] with the intention of triggering a counter-revolution in Brittany.<ref name=\"RG48\">Gardiner, ''Fleet Battle and Blockade'' p. 48</ref> This force consisted of an additional three ships of the line, six frigates and more than 50 transports containing 2,500 French Royalists. The voyage across the English Channel and around the [[Ushant]] headland took seven days, the combined fleet and expeditionary force arriving off Belle \u00cele on 19 June.<ref name=\"WJ244\">James, p. 244</ref> Bridport had ordered Warren to take his convoy on to Quiberon while the main body of the Channel Fleet stood further out to sea to intercept any attack by the French Atlantic Fleet, which Bridport assumed would advance southwards from Brest. What the British admiral did not know was that not only had the French fleet sailed a week earlier, they were still at sea \u2013 Villaret's ships having been blown southwards by a severe gale on 18 June and forced to take shelter in the anchorage off Belle \u00cele.<ref name=\"WJ243\">James, p. 243</ref>\n\n==Engagement off Groix==\n{{See also|Order of Battle in the Biscay campaign of June 1795}}\n\n===Villaret's retreat===\n[[File:Battle of Groix locator.png|Villaret retreated to near the island of Groix, indicated by the red dot, off the coast of France southeast of Brest.|thumb|alt=The island of Groix is near the French coast southeast of Brest.]]\nIt was one of Warren's ships, the frigate [[HMS Arethusa (1793)|HMS ''Arethusa'']], which first discovered the French as Villaret led his fleet out from the sheltered anchorage. Lookouts on ''Arethusa'' miscounted the French fleet, identifying 16 ships of the line and ten frigates; Warren immediately sent word to Bridport while ordering his convoy to turn away from the French.<ref name=\"WJ244\">James, p. 244</ref> Villaret did not pursue Warren's force: he may not have gauged its true strength correctly, and his ships were running low on provisions having taken aboard only enough for 15 days in their haste to leave Brest a week earlier.<ref name=\"WJ238\">James, p. 238</ref> On the morning of 20 June, Warren's force sighted Bridport's fleet to the south-east, the admiral sending orders to Warren to detach his three ships of the line to bolster Bridport's fleet in the face of the supposedly more numerous French force. Without waiting for these reinforcements, Bridport sailed back towards the coast against the wind, seeking to place his fleet between the Quiberon expedition and Villaret's ships.<ref name=\"WJ245\">James, p. 245</ref>\n\nThe adverse southeasterly winds frustrated both fleets, and it was not until 03:30 on 22 June that lookouts on Bridport's scouting frigates [[HMS Nymphe (1780)|HMS ''Nymphe'']] and [[HMS Astrea (1781)|HMS ''Astrea'']] finally discovered the French in the distance to the southeast,<ref name=\"LG1\"/> the British approximately {{convert|42|nmi|km}} from the French coast.<ref name=\"WLC261\">Clowes, p. 261</ref> On seeing the larger British fleet, to which Warren's detached ships had still not joined, Villaret ordered his fleet to turn back towards the land and Bridport followed, seeing that the French admiral did not intend to offer battle.<ref name=\"WJ245\"/> To maximise his chances of catching the French, Bridport specifically ordered his \"best-sailing\" ships [[HMS Sans Pareil (1794)|HMS ''Sans Pareil'']], [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMS Colossus (1787)|HMS ''Colossus'']], [[HMS Irresistible (1782)|HMS ''Irresistible'']], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS ''Valiant'']] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']], to break from the formation and lead the pursuit at 06:30.<ref name=\"WLC261\"/><ref name=\"EPB231\">Brenton, p. 231</ref> Bridport followed in his 100-gun [[first rate]] flagship [[HMS Royal George (1788)|HMS ''Royal George'']], accompanied by the remainder of the fleet, which included another 100-gun ship [[HMS Queen Charlotte (1790)|HMS ''Queen Charlotte'']] and seven 98-gun [[second rate]] ships.<ref name=\"WLC260\">Clowes, p. 260</ref>\n\nAll day the chase continued: at 12:00 the French fleet were approximately {{convert|12|nmi|km}} distant, and all through the afternoon the British ships slowly gained on their opponents, both sides hampered by long periods of calm weather.<ref name=\"WLC261\"/> To ensure that his fleet was in a position to intercept the French whichever [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] they took, Bridport split his fleet across a wide front, clustered in two trailing groups. At 19:00, Bridport signaled for his ships to attack the rearmost French vessels, and at 19:25 to attack French ships as and when they overhauled them, taking up mutually supportive positions.<ref name=\"WJ245\"/><ref name=\"EPB231\"/> At 22:30 a calm fell, arresting both fleets until 03:00 on 23 June, when a light breeze from the south-west was enough to allow Bridport's fleet to push onwards so that as dawn rose the French were dead ahead. The main body of the French fleet was sailing in a loose cluster with three or four ships trailing behind and one ship, [[HMS Alexander (1778)|''Alexandre'']] under Captain [[Fran\u00e7ois Charles Guillemet]] far to the rear and only {{convert|3|nmi|km}} from the British vanguard.<ref name=\"WJ245-246\">James, pp. 245\u2013246</ref> ''Alexandre'' had been a British ship until November 1794, when she had been captured in a [[Action of 6 November 1794|sharp engagement]] with a French squadron in which the ship had been badly damaged.<ref name=\"WLC262\">Clowes, p. 262</ref> The ship was a poor sailer, and its position was worsened by poor handling by Guillemet who did not follow Villaret's orders to form a [[line of battle]] rapidly enough.<ref name=\"CR210\">Rouvier, p. 210</ref>\n\nAgainst expectation, Bridport's leading ship was ''Queen Charlotte'', which had attained an unusually fast speed for a first rate through the carefully planned sailing of Captain [[Sir Andrew Snape Douglas]]. Immediately behind Douglas was Captain [[Richard Grindall]] in ''Irresistible'', with ''Orion'', ''Colossus'', ''Sans Pareil'' and ''Russell'' a short distance behind the leaders and the rest of the fleet substantially to the rear.<ref name=\"WJ245\"/> At 04:00, the island of Groix lay approximately {{convert|8|nmi|km}} to the east of ''Queen Charlotte'', the French coastline behind it. It was to this region that Villaret was retreating, hoping Bridport would be reluctant to follow him into the confined waters around the well-fortified island, which lies on the entrance to the port of Lorient. The southern Breton coast was a notoriously dangerous region, where Atlantic gales could push ships towards poorly charted reefs and rocky outcrops.<ref name=\"RG101\">Gardiner, ''Campaign of Trafalgar'' p. 101</ref>\n\n===23 June===\n[[File:Bridport's action 1795.jpg|thumb|''\"An exact Representation of the Capture of three Ships of the Line, and total defeat of the French Fleet, by a Squadron under Command of Admiral Lord Bridport, on the 23 of June, 1795\"'' E.

Just under an hour later, Douglas brought ''Queen Charlotte'' within range, Guillemet firing his [[Chase gun|stern-chasers]] at his three-decked opponent.<ref name=\"WJ246\">James, p. 246</ref> Douglas responded with his bow-chasers, gradually bringing his main battery into range and joined by Captain [[Sir James Saumarez]] in ''Orion'', which opened fire shortly after 06:00. The frigate captain, aware that his ship was powerless against two such opponents, abandoned the tow and sped ahead to rejoin the French fleet. Villaret's force had once more divided, with [[HMS Belleisle (1795)|''Formidable'']] under Captain [[Charles Linois]] a little way ahead of ''Alexandre'' and Villaret in his 120-gun flagship [[French ship Oc\u00e9an (1790)|''Peuple'']] ahead of ''Formidable''. With the French admiral were [[French ship Redoutable (1791)|''Redoutable'']], [[French ship Orion (1787)|''Mucius'']], [[French ship Wattignies (1794)|''Wattignies'']], [[French ship Tigre (1793)|''Tigre'']] and Vence's flagship [[French ship Nestor (1793)|''Nestor'']], while the remainder of the fleet had pushed on ahead and were now substantially advanced.<ref name=\"WLC262\"/> Villaret sent signals to form a tight line of battle, and all French ships repeated the signal, but none executed the manoeuvre.<ref name=\"FC240\">Chasseriau, p. 240</ref>\n\nAt 06:15, ''Queen Charlotte'' passed ''Alexandre'' and began firing on ''Formidable'', Linois returning fire against his much larger enemy for fifteen minutes before a fire broke out on the [[poop deck]].<ref name=\"JA184\">Allen, p. 184</ref> As the French crew scrambled to extinguish it, ''Sans Pareil'', flagship of Rear-Admiral [[Lord Hugh Seymour]], reached the ship and fired a broadside in passing, causing ''Formidable'' to lose speed and fall further back from the main body of the French. The fire from ''Queen Charlotte'' had reduced Linois's ship to a wreck, with the rigging torn and more than 320 men killed or wounded from a crew of 717.<ref name=\"WJ246-248\">James, pp. 246\u2013248</ref> As ''Sans Pareil'' passed ahead of the battered ship, the mizzenmast on ''Formidable'' collapsed over the side and Linois, seeing the rest of the British fleet rapidly approaching, [[striking the colours|struck his colours]] and surrendered.<ref name=\"EPB232\">Brenton, p. 232</ref> As ''Sans Pareil'' and ''Queen Charlotte'' battled ''Formidable'', ''Colossus'' and ''Russell'', joined by the second rates [[HMS London (1766)|HMS ''London'']] and [[HMS Queen (1769)|HMS ''Queen'']], pushed on to the French centre where Villaret's ships were awaiting them, the French admiral repeatedly attempting to form his ships into a line of battle to receive the British attack, without success.<ref name=\"CR212\">Rouvier, p. 212</ref>\n\nAt 07:00, four British ships and six French fought a confused melee while the French vanguard continued eastwards without pause and the slower portions of the British fleet struggled to come up in the light winds.<ref name=\"WJ246\"/> The entire combat was slowly pulling closer to the fortified rocky island of Groix, close to which Villaret intended to shelter his fleet. Douglas in ''Queen Charlotte'' had been forced out of the engagement due to severe damage to his rigging and sails which made his ship unmanageable. At 07:14, he drifted past the shattered hull of ''Alexandre''; Captain Guillemet opened fire briefly before surrendering as Douglas returned it with devastating effect.<ref name=\"WLC262-263\">Clowes, pp. 262\u2013263</ref> Even as his ship fell back, Douglas continued to engage the French at long range, turning the guns on ''Peuple'' and ''Tigre'', joined by ''Sans Pareil'' which attacked ''Tigre'' under Captain [[Jacques Bedout]] and forced it out of the French formation with severe damage. Villaret again attempted to gather his forces in support of ''Tigre'', and even positioned his frigate ahead of his own fleeing ships in hope of cutting off their retreat and forcing them to imitate his own manoeuvres, but in vain; \"they would have passed over my very body had not {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Nicolas Topsent|fr|3=Jean-Nicolas Topsent|lt=representant Topsent}} taken command and prevented a collision\", he wrote in his report.<ref name=\"FC242\">Chasseriau, p. 242</ref> As ''Tigre'' fell out of line, ''Queen'' and ''London'' joined the attack on the isolated ship, and Bedout was forced to surrender in the face of overwhelming odds.<ref name=\"WJ247\">James, p. 247</ref> The French ship had been severely damaged, with {{convert|8|ft|m}} of water in the hold, the masts and rigging badly torn and more than 130 men killed or wounded, including Bedout, who had been hit three times.<ref name=\"CR213\">Rouvier, p. 213</ref>\n\nAt 07:57, Bridport's ''Royal George'' reached the combat, Douglas falling in behind his ship in anticipation of a renewed attack, the crew of ''Queen Charlotte'' having conducted enough hasty repairs to regain control of their ship. At 08:15 Bridport signaled ''Colossus'' under Captain [[John Monkton]], the leading British ship more than {{convert|1.5|nmi|km}} ahead of the flagship, to return to the fleet. He repeated the order to Seymour in ''Sans Pareil'' who was almost as far advanced in combat with the retreating ''Peuple'',<ref name=\"WJ247\"/> on which Villaret's flag captain [[Jacques Angot]] had been killed in action.<ref name=\"D1051\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=h9BIAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA190&lpg=RA1-PA190&dq=%22Jacques+Angot%22+capitaine&source=bl&ots=jDn2dVgIrC&sig=tG0PetfteQ-XHhWvcQWjChHVAQw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qIaWT-OrO-ax0AWyrsCVDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Jacques%20Angot%22%20capitaine&f=false D\u00e9cret no 1051 de la Convention nationale], ''Collection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des d\u00e9crets rendus par la Convention Nationale, Volume 51'', Retrieved 28 April 2012</ref> Bridport then pulled ahead in the pursuit, catching the badly damaged ''Peuple'' approximately {{convert|0.5|nmi|km}} west of Groix and firing one broadside at the French flagship and another at ''Tigre'', which Bridport was not aware had already surrendered. At 08:37, ignoring the nearby ''Peuple'' and the remainder of the French fleet scattered between Groix and the [[River La\u00efta]], Bridport turned away to the south-west followed by the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ247\"/><ref name=\"WLC263\">Clowes, p. 263</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nBridport gave instructions as he withdrew for ''Alexandre'', ''Formidable'' and ''Tigre'' to be taken under tow by [[HMS Prince (1788)|HMS ''Prince'']], [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] and [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS ''Prince George'']] respectively.<ref name=\"WLC263\"/> The British fleet was in good condition: five ships had seen no action at all and of those that had fought, only ''Queen Charlotte'' had suffered any significant damage, principally to her rigging. The British fleet had lost 31 men killed and 113 wounded; ''Queen Charlotte'' and ''Colossus'' had the heaviest casualties of 36 and 35 respectively.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> Bridport placed prize crews on the captured vessels and sent them back to Britain while turning the fleet back eastwards once it had reached a safe distance from the coast, in order to provide support for Warren's expedition to Quiberon. Warren landed the French Royalist forces at [[Carnac]] on 27 June, but the invasion ended in disaster a month later, the surviving Royalists driven back to the coast and collected by Warren.<ref name=\"WLC266\">Clowes, p. 266</ref> Bridport had remained off Quiberon to ensure that Villaret did not return to harass the expeditionary force, returning to Britain on 20 September but leaving the bulk of the blockade fleet off the Breton coast under Rear-Admiral [[Henry Harvey]]. The 68-year-old Bridport was forcibly retired in October after an unrelated argument with [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]], but was reinstated in 1796 and continued to serve in command of the Channel Fleet until 1800.<ref name=\"ODNB Hood\">{{Cite ODNB|id=13671|title=Hood, Alexander}}</ref><ref name=\"WLC267\">Clowes, p. 267</ref>\n\nVillaret meanwhile gathered his scattered ships and called a council of his senior officers on the frigate [[HMS Amelia (1796)|''Prosperine'']] to discuss their next course of action. The French admiral believed Bridport had only temporarily withdrawn and would be soon returning to continue the engagement. He therefore proposed to anchor off the Breton coast in a strong defensive position and await Bridport's attack. This scheme was vociferously opposed by Contre-amirals [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen de Tr\u00e9marec|Kerguelen]] and [[\u00c9tienne Eustache Bruix]] who argued that in such a position the British would be able to use the [[weather gage]] to bombard the French at will and attack them with [[fireships]].<ref name=\"WJ249\">James, p. 249</ref> Following their advice, Villaret decided to shelter the fleet in the nearby port of Lorient to seek supplies and repairs before returning to Brest. But he found that, having sailed without sufficient provisions, Lorient was not equipped for a fleet of such size and Villaret was forced to discharge the majority of sailors as he was unable to feed them. It was not until December and the winter storm season that a number of the ships were able to travel quietly up the coast to Brest, while others were sent southwards to [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]].<ref name=\"WJ253\">James, p. 253</ref> French casualties had been heavy, although they have not been reported other than on the captured vessels, which totaled 670 killed and wounded.<ref name=\"WJ248\">James, p. 248</ref> In the aftermath of the action, Villaret wrote a letter condemning the behaviour of a number of his officers, stating \"''Soit ignorance, soit ineptie, soit insubordination, malgr\u00e9 nos signaux r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9s, des ordres transmis par porte-voix, rien ne fut fait. Nos boulets atterissaient dans l'eau, le patriotisme \u00e0 lui seul ne peut manoeuvrer un navire''\" (\"Be it ignorance, ineptitude or insubordination, in spite of our repeated signals, nothing was done. Our shots landed in water, patriotism alone cannot manoeuvre a ship\").<ref name=\"HG214\">Granier, p. 98</ref> Several French captains were [[court-martial]]led: [[Jean-Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Aved-Magnac|Jean Magnac]] of [[French ship Z\u00e9l\u00e9 (1764)|''Z\u00e9l\u00e9'']], already blamed for the failure at Cornwallis's Retreat, was dismissed from the Navy, as was Captain Giot-Labri\u00e8re of [[French ship Fougueux (1785)|''Fougueux'']]. Captain Larr\u00e9guy of ''Mucius'' was censured for not adequately supporting ''Tigre'', and three other captains were tried but acquitted.<ref name=\"CR214\">Rouvier, p. 214</ref>\n\nIn common with the battle of the Glorious First of June the previous year,<ref name=\"WJ181\">James, p. 181</ref> rewards for the British victory at Groix were unevenly distributed. Bridport's dispatch to the Admiralty was short and lacking in detail; the only officer commended was Bridport's own flag captain [[William Domett]], whose ship had joined the action only in the last stages. The situation was worsened by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], which voted thanks for the battle but specifically named only Bridport, Lord Hugh Seymour and Vice-Admiral [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Sir Alan Gardner]] of ''Queen''. This omitted not only the numerous captains who had taken part in the battle, but also Vice-Admiral [[John Colpoys]] of ''London'', whose ship had been much more heavily engaged than Gardner's.<ref name=\"WLC265\">Clowes, p. 265</ref><ref name=\"LG1\"/> Numerous historians have commented on these unexplained omissions, [[William James (naval historian)|William James]] noting that Douglas and ''Queen Charlotte'' were particularly unfortunate in this regard as the admiral normally aboard, Rear-Admiral [[Sir Roger Curtis]], was ashore at the court-martial of Captain [[Anthony James Pye Molloy|Anthony Molloy]] and consequently the ship received no recognition despite being the most heavily engaged of any in the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ249\"/>\n\nAll three captured ships were taken into the Royal Navy. The name of ''Alexandre'' reverted to the former ''Alexander'', and although James suggests that the ship was never again fit for frontline service, this claim is refuted by ''Alexander''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s presence in the line at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1798 under Captain [[Alexander Ball]].<ref name=\"Win\">Winfield, p. 51</ref> ''Tigre'' retained her French name, while ''Formidable'', as there was already a ship by that name in the Royal Navy, became HMS ''Belleisle'', apparently due to confusion between the islands of Groix and Belle \u00cele in the aftermath of the battle.<ref name=\"WJ250\">James, p. 250</ref> ''Belleisle'' had a long and successful career, fighting at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805 under Captain [[William Hargood]].<ref name=\"ODNB Hargood\">{{Cite ODNB|id=12312|title=Hargood, Sir William}}</ref>\n\nMore controversial than the distribution of commendations was the debate over Bridport's decision to withdraw from the battle while the remainder of the French fleet was still within reach. In his official dispatch, the British admiral wrote that \"If the Enemy had not been protected and sheltered by the Land, I have every reason to believe that a much greater Number, if not all the Line of Battle ships, would have been taken or destroyed\", going on note that \"When the ships struck, the British squadron was near to some Batteries [on Groix], and in the Face of a strong Naval Port [Lorient].<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=13790|pages=673\u2013674|date=27 June 1795}}</ref> His subsequent concern for the Quiberon expeditionary convoy also demonstrates that he considered its protection his principal duty. But in the opinion of French admiral Kerguelen, ''\"S'ils avaient bien manouevr\u00e9, ils auraient pu, ou prendre tous nos vaisseaux, ou les faire p\u00e9rir \u00e0 la c\u00f4te\"'' (If [the English] had manoeuvred successfully they could have taken all our vessels, or made them perish on the coast).<ref name=\"WJ249\"/> Historians have considered this view and most agree that Bridport's retirement was premature: In 1827 James noted that the scattered remains of the French fleet could easily have been attacked by the unengaged British rear with the advantage of the weather gage,<ref name=\"WJ247\"/> while [[William Laird Clowes]] wrote in 1901 that \"We may be pretty sure that had a [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]], a [[Edward Hawke|Hawke]] or even a [[Edward Boscawen|Boscawen]] commanded on the occasion, the fleet of Villaret would have been annihilated.\"<ref name=\"WLC266\"/> Twenty-first-century historians Noel Mostert and [[Richard Woodman]] have compared Groix with the battles of [[Battle of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Naval Battle of Hy\u00e8res Islands|Hy\u00e8res]] fought during the year in the Mediterranean, where in similar circumstances another elderly admiral, [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]], had also allowed scattered and retreating French fleets to escape when they might have been destroyed.<ref name=\"NM164\">Mostert, p. 164</ref><ref name=\"RW61\">Woodman, p. 61</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Allen\n | first = Joseph\n | authorlink =\n | year = 1905\n | origyear= 1842\n | chapter =\n | title = Battles of the British Navy\n | edition = 9th\n | publisher = Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co\n | location = London\n | id =\n | oclc = 85994488\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Brenton\n | first = Edward Pelham\n | authorlink = Edward Pelham Brenton\n | year = 1837\n | origyear = 1825\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Vol. I\n | url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_LCRy8AHxwrYC\n | quote = edward pelham brenton.\n | publisher = C.

The battle was fought between elements of the British [[Channel Fleet]] and the French Atlantic Fleet, which were cruising in the region on separate missions. The British fleet, commanded by Admiral [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Lord Bridport]], was covering an [[Invasion of France (1795)|invasion convoy]] carrying a [[\u00c9migr\u00e9 armies of the French Revolutionary Wars|French Royalist]] army to invade [[Quiberon]], while the French under Vice-amiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] had sailed a week earlier to rescue a French convoy from attack by a British squadron. The French fleet had driven off the British squadron in a battle on 17 June known as [[Cornwallis's Retreat]], and were attempting to return to their base at [[Brest, France|Brest]] when Bridport's force of 14 [[ships of the line]] appeared on 22 June.\n\nVillaret, believing that the stronger British fleet would destroy his own 12 ships of the line, ordered his force to fall back to the inshore anchorage off Groix, hoping to take shelter in protected coastal waters. Several of his ships were too slow, falling behind so that early in the morning of 23 June the rearmost ships of his fleet were caught by the British vanguard, overhauled one by one and brought to battle. Although Villaret fought a determined rearguard action, three French ships were captured, all with very heavy casualties, and the remainder of the French fleet was left scattered across miles of coastline. In this position they were highly vulnerable to continued British attack, but after only a few hours' engagement, concerned that his ships might be wrecked on the rocky coastline, Bridport called off the action and allowed Villaret to regroup inshore and retreat to [[Lorient]].\n\nAlthough the battle was a British victory, there was criticism of Bridport's rapid withdrawal. British historians have subsequently considered that a unique opportunity to destroy the French Atlantic fleet had been lost. The [[Invasion of France (1795)|invasion at Quiberon]] ended in disaster a month later, although Bridport remained at sea in the region until September. The French fleet by contrast was trapped in the port of Lorient where food supplies ran out, forcing Villaret to discharge many of his ships' crews. As a result, most ships did not return to Brest until the winter and were consequently unable to threaten British control of the French coastline for the remainder of the year. Several French captains were court-martialled following the battle, with two dismissed from the Navy for disobeying orders.\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] had seen the French Atlantic Fleet, based principally at the [[Brittany|Breton]] harbour of [[Brest, France|Brest]], suffer a series of setbacks. The tense atmosphere in France following the [[French Revolution]] was reflected in the fleet, which suffered a mutiny in September 1793 followed by [[Reign of Terror|a purge]] of suspected anti-republicans which resulted in the death or imprisonment of a number of experienced commanders.<ref name=\"WJ59\">James, p. 59</ref><ref name=\"SW34\">Willis, p. 34</ref> In [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794|May 1794]], the French fleet sallied into the Atlantic to protect an incoming grain convoy from the [[United States]] and was attacked by the British [[Channel Fleet]] at the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], losing seven ships, although the convoy was saved. In the winter of 1794\u20131795, five more French ships were lost in a disastrous sortie in the middle of the Atlantic winter storm season known as the ''[[Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver]]''. By the spring of 1795, the British Channel Fleet was in the ascendancy, enforcing a distant [[blockade]] of the French fleet in Brest.<ref name=\"RG16\">Gardiner, ''Fleet Battle and Blockade'' p. 16</ref>\n\nIn May 1795, with much of the winter's damage repaired, the French commander [[Vice-amiral]] [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] sent a squadron of three [[ships of the line]] and several [[frigates]] under [[Contre-amiral]] [[Jean Gaspard Vence]] to [[Bordeaux]] with orders to escort a convoy of merchant ships carrying wine and brandy to Brest.<ref name=\"WLC255\">Clowes, p. 255</ref> On 8 June, as Vence's convoy passed the fortified island of [[Belle \u00cele]] on the southern Breton coast they were discovered by a British battle squadron of five ships of the line and two frigates under Vice-Admiral [[William Cornwallis]].<ref name=\"WLC256\">Clowes, p. 256</ref> Vence ordered his outnumbered ships to shelter under the batteries of Belle \u00cele, and after a brief skirmish Cornwallis withdrew his forces with eight captured merchant ships. While Cornwallis was escorting his prizes to the mouth of the Channel, Vence sailed out of the Belle \u00cele anchorage and discovered on 15 June that the main force of the Atlantic fleet had sailed to rescue him, a mission ordered by government over the objections of the fleet's officers that Vence would be able to easily extricate himself from the anchorage due to the proximity of the port of [[Lorient]].<ref name=\"WJ237-238\">James, pp. 237\u2013238</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 16 June Cornwallis returned to the region, hunting for Vence, and instead discovered Villaret de Joyeuse with an overwhelming force. This time Cornwallis was forced to retreat, heading into open water with the French fleet in pursuit. Cornwallis was hampered by the poor sailing of two of his squadron, and on the morning of 17 June the leading French ships were close enough to open fire on his rearguard.<ref name=\"WJ240\">James, p. 240</ref> Throughout the day the French vanguard kept up a distant but continual fire on the rearmost British ship [[HMS Mars (1794)|HMS ''Mars'']], until eventually the ship began to fall behind. In an effort to protect ''Mars'', Cornwallis interposed his 100-gun flagship [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|HMS ''Royal Sovereign'']] between the British squadron and the French force, its massive broadsides driving the French back.<ref name=\"WLC257\">Clowes, p. 257</ref> At the same time, Cornwallis had ordered the frigate [[HMS Phaeton (1782)|HMS ''Phaeton'']] to range ahead of his squadron making false signals announcing the imminent arrival of a British fleet. These signals, in combination with the coincidental appearance of unidentified sails to the north, caused Villaret to become so concerned that at 18:40 he called off pursuit and returned to the French coast, allowing Cornwallis to return to Britain without further incident. The engagement was subsequently known as [[Cornwallis's Retreat]].<ref name=\"WJ241\">James, p. 241</ref>\n\nUnbeknownst to either Villaret or Cornwallis, the British Channel Fleet was also at sea, having sailed from [[Spithead]] on 12 June with 14 ships of the line and 11 smaller vessels under the command of Admiral [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport]]. Bridport had been tasked with ensuring the safety of a convoy of transports, commanded by Commodore [[Sir John Borlase Warren]], which carried a [[\u00c9migr\u00e9 armies of the French Revolutionary Wars|French Royalist]] army to [[Quiberon]] with the intention of triggering a counter-revolution in Brittany.<ref name=\"RG48\">Gardiner, ''Fleet Battle and Blockade'' p. 48</ref> This force consisted of an additional three ships of the line, six frigates and more than 50 transports containing 2,500 French Royalists. The voyage across the English Channel and around the [[Ushant]] headland took seven days, the combined fleet and expeditionary force arriving off Belle \u00cele on 19 June.<ref name=\"WJ244\">James, p. 244</ref> Bridport had ordered Warren to take his convoy on to Quiberon while the main body of the Channel Fleet stood further out to sea to intercept any attack by the French Atlantic Fleet, which Bridport assumed would advance southwards from Brest. What the British admiral did not know was that not only had the French fleet sailed a week earlier, they were still at sea \u2013 Villaret's ships having been blown southwards by a severe gale on 18 June and forced to take shelter in the anchorage off Belle \u00cele.<ref name=\"WJ243\">James, p. 243</ref>\n\n==Engagement off Groix==\n{{See also|Order of Battle in the Biscay campaign of June 1795}}\n\n===Villaret's retreat===\n[[File:Battle of Groix locator.png|Villaret retreated to near the island of Groix, indicated by the red dot, off the coast of France southeast of Brest.|thumb|alt=The island of Groix is near the French coast southeast of Brest.]]\nIt was one of Warren's ships, the frigate [[HMS Arethusa (1793)|HMS ''Arethusa'']], which first discovered the French as Villaret led his fleet out from the sheltered anchorage. Lookouts on ''Arethusa'' miscounted the French fleet, identifying 16 ships of the line and ten frigates; Warren immediately sent word to Bridport while ordering his convoy to turn away from the French.<ref name=\"WJ244\">James, p. 244</ref> Villaret did not pursue Warren's force: he may not have gauged its true strength correctly, and his ships were running low on provisions having taken aboard only enough for 15 days in their haste to leave Brest a week earlier.<ref name=\"WJ238\">James, p. 238</ref> On the morning of 20 June, Warren's force sighted Bridport's fleet to the south-east, the admiral sending orders to Warren to detach his three ships of the line to bolster Bridport's fleet in the face of the supposedly more numerous French force. Without waiting for these reinforcements, Bridport sailed back towards the coast against the wind, seeking to place his fleet between the Quiberon expedition and Villaret's ships.<ref name=\"WJ245\">James, p. 245</ref>\n\nThe adverse southeasterly winds frustrated both fleets, and it was not until 03:30 on 22 June that lookouts on Bridport's scouting frigates [[HMS Nymphe (1780)|HMS ''Nymphe'']] and [[HMS Astrea (1781)|HMS ''Astrea'']] finally discovered the French in the distance to the southeast,<ref name=\"LG1\"/> the British approximately {{convert|42|nmi|km}} from the French coast.<ref name=\"WLC261\">Clowes, p. 261</ref> On seeing the larger British fleet, to which Warren's detached ships had still not joined, Villaret ordered his fleet to turn back towards the land and Bridport followed, seeing that the French admiral did not intend to offer battle.<ref name=\"WJ245\"/> To maximise his chances of catching the French, Bridport specifically ordered his \"best-sailing\" ships [[HMS Sans Pareil (1794)|HMS ''Sans Pareil'']], [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMS Colossus (1787)|HMS ''Colossus'']], [[HMS Irresistible (1782)|HMS ''Irresistible'']], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS ''Valiant'']] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']], to break from the formation and lead the pursuit at 06:30.<ref name=\"WLC261\"/><ref name=\"EPB231\">Brenton, p. 231</ref> Bridport followed in his 100-gun [[first rate]] flagship [[HMS Royal George (1788)|HMS ''Royal George'']], accompanied by the remainder of the fleet, which included another 100-gun ship [[HMS Queen Charlotte (1790)|HMS ''Queen Charlotte'']] and seven 98-gun [[second rate]] ships.<ref name=\"WLC260\">Clowes, p. 260</ref>\n\nAll day the chase continued: at 12:00 the French fleet were approximately {{convert|12|nmi|km}} distant, and all through the afternoon the British ships slowly gained on their opponents, both sides hampered by long periods of calm weather.<ref name=\"WLC261\"/> To ensure that his fleet was in a position to intercept the French whichever [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] they took, Bridport split his fleet across a wide front, clustered in two trailing groups. At 19:00, Bridport signaled for his ships to attack the rearmost French vessels, and at 19:25 to attack French ships as and when they overhauled them, taking up mutually supportive positions.<ref name=\"WJ245\"/><ref name=\"EPB231\"/> At 22:30 a calm fell, arresting both fleets until 03:00 on 23 June, when a light breeze from the south-west was enough to allow Bridport's fleet to push onwards so that as dawn rose the French were dead ahead. The main body of the French fleet was sailing in a loose cluster with three or four ships trailing behind and one ship, [[HMS Alexander (1778)|''Alexandre'']] under Captain [[Fran\u00e7ois Charles Guillemet]] far to the rear and only {{convert|3|nmi|km}} from the British vanguard.<ref name=\"WJ245-246\">James, pp. 245\u2013246</ref> ''Alexandre'' had been a British ship until November 1794, when she had been captured in a [[Action of 6 November 1794|sharp engagement]] with a French squadron in which the ship had been badly damaged.<ref name=\"WLC262\">Clowes, p. 262</ref> The ship was a poor sailer, and its position was worsened by poor handling by Guillemet who did not follow Villaret's orders to form a [[line of battle]] rapidly enough.<ref name=\"CR210\">Rouvier, p. 210</ref>\n\nAgainst expectation, Bridport's leading ship was ''Queen Charlotte'', which had attained an unusually fast speed for a first rate through the carefully planned sailing of Captain [[Sir Andrew Snape Douglas]]. Immediately behind Douglas was Captain [[Richard Grindall]] in ''Irresistible'', with ''Orion'', ''Colossus'', ''Sans Pareil'' and ''Russell'' a short distance behind the leaders and the rest of the fleet substantially to the rear.<ref name=\"WJ245\"/> At 04:00, the island of Groix lay approximately {{convert|8|nmi|km}} to the east of ''Queen Charlotte'', the French coastline behind it. It was to this region that Villaret was retreating, hoping Bridport would be reluctant to follow him into the confined waters around the well-fortified island, which lies on the entrance to the port of Lorient. The southern Breton coast was a notoriously dangerous region, where Atlantic gales could push ships towards poorly charted reefs and rocky outcrops.<ref name=\"RG101\">Gardiner, ''Campaign of Trafalgar'' p. 101</ref>\n\n===23 June===\n[[File:Bridport's action 1795.jpg|thumb|''\"An exact Representation of the Capture of three Ships of the Line, and total defeat of the French Fleet, by a Squadron under Command of Admiral Lord Bridport, on the 23 of June, 1795\"'' E.

Just under an hour later, Douglas brought ''Queen Charlotte'' within range, Guillemet firing his [[Chase gun|stern-chasers]] at his three-decked opponent.<ref name=\"WJ246\">James, p. 246</ref> Douglas responded with his bow-chasers, gradually bringing his main battery into range and joined by Captain [[Sir James Saumarez]] in ''Orion'', which opened fire shortly after 06:00. The frigate captain, aware that his ship was powerless against two such opponents, abandoned the tow and sped ahead to rejoin the French fleet. Villaret's force had once more divided, with [[HMS Belleisle (1795)|''Formidable'']] under Captain [[Charles Linois]] a little way ahead of ''Alexandre'' and Villaret in his 120-gun flagship [[French ship Oc\u00e9an (1790)|''Peuple'']] ahead of ''Formidable''. With the French admiral were [[French ship Redoutable (1791)|''Redoutable'']], [[French ship Orion (1787)|''Mucius'']], [[French ship Wattignies (1794)|''Wattignies'']], [[French ship Tigre (1793)|''Tigre'']] and Vence's flagship [[French ship Nestor (1793)|''Nestor'']], while the remainder of the fleet had pushed on ahead and were now substantially advanced.<ref name=\"WLC262\"/> Villaret sent signals to form a tight line of battle, and all French ships repeated the signal, but none executed the manoeuvre.<ref name=\"FC240\">Chasseriau, p. 240</ref>\n\nAt 06:15, ''Queen Charlotte'' passed ''Alexandre'' and began firing on ''Formidable'', Linois returning fire against his much larger enemy for fifteen minutes before a fire broke out on the [[poop deck]].<ref name=\"JA184\">Allen, p. 184</ref> As the French crew scrambled to extinguish it, ''Sans Pareil'', flagship of Rear-Admiral [[Lord Hugh Seymour]], reached the ship and fired a broadside in passing, causing ''Formidable'' to lose speed and fall further back from the main body of the French. The fire from ''Queen Charlotte'' had reduced Linois's ship to a wreck, with the rigging torn and more than 320 men killed or wounded from a crew of 717.<ref name=\"WJ246-248\">James, pp. 246\u2013248</ref> As ''Sans Pareil'' passed ahead of the battered ship, the mizzenmast on ''Formidable'' collapsed over the side and Linois, seeing the rest of the British fleet rapidly approaching, [[striking the colours|struck his colours]] and surrendered.<ref name=\"EPB232\">Brenton, p. 232</ref> As ''Sans Pareil'' and ''Queen Charlotte'' battled ''Formidable'', ''Colossus'' and ''Russell'', joined by the second rates [[HMS London (1766)|HMS ''London'']] and [[HMS Queen (1769)|HMS ''Queen'']], pushed on to the French centre where Villaret's ships were awaiting them, the French admiral repeatedly attempting to form his ships into a line of battle to receive the British attack, without success.<ref name=\"CR212\">Rouvier, p. 212</ref>\n\nAt 07:00, four British ships and six French fought a confused melee while the French vanguard continued eastwards without pause and the slower portions of the British fleet struggled to come up in the light winds.<ref name=\"WJ246\"/> The entire combat was slowly pulling closer to the fortified rocky island of Groix, close to which Villaret intended to shelter his fleet. Douglas in ''Queen Charlotte'' had been forced out of the engagement due to severe damage to his rigging and sails which made his ship unmanageable. At 07:14, he drifted past the shattered hull of ''Alexandre''; Captain Guillemet opened fire briefly before surrendering as Douglas returned it with devastating effect.<ref name=\"WLC262-263\">Clowes, pp. 262\u2013263</ref> Even as his ship fell back, Douglas continued to engage the French at long range, turning the guns on ''Peuple'' and ''Tigre'', joined by ''Sans Pareil'' which attacked ''Tigre'' under Captain [[Jacques Bedout]] and forced it out of the French formation with severe damage. Villaret again attempted to gather his forces in support of ''Tigre'', and even positioned his frigate ahead of his own fleeing ships in hope of cutting off their retreat and forcing them to imitate his own manoeuvres, but in vain; \"they would have passed over my very body had not {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Nicolas Topsent|fr|3=Jean-Nicolas Topsent|lt=representant Topsent}} taken command and prevented a collision\", he wrote in his report.<ref name=\"FC242\">Chasseriau, p. 242</ref> As ''Tigre'' fell out of line, ''Queen'' and ''London'' joined the attack on the isolated ship, and Bedout was forced to surrender in the face of overwhelming odds.<ref name=\"WJ247\">James, p. 247</ref> The French ship had been severely damaged, with {{convert|8|ft|m}} of water in the hold, the masts and rigging badly torn and more than 130 men killed or wounded, including Bedout, who had been hit three times.<ref name=\"CR213\">Rouvier, p. 213</ref>\n\nAt 07:57, Bridport's ''Royal George'' reached the combat, Douglas falling in behind his ship in anticipation of a renewed attack, the crew of ''Queen Charlotte'' having conducted enough hasty repairs to regain control of their ship. At 08:15 Bridport signaled ''Colossus'' under Captain [[John Monkton]], the leading British ship more than {{convert|1.5|nmi|km}} ahead of the flagship, to return to the fleet. He repeated the order to Seymour in ''Sans Pareil'' who was almost as far advanced in combat with the retreating ''Peuple'',<ref name=\"WJ247\"/> on which Villaret's flag captain [[Jacques Angot]] had been killed in action.<ref name=\"D1051\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=h9BIAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA190&lpg=RA1-PA190&dq=%22Jacques+Angot%22+capitaine&source=bl&ots=jDn2dVgIrC&sig=tG0PetfteQ-XHhWvcQWjChHVAQw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qIaWT-OrO-ax0AWyrsCVDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Jacques%20Angot%22%20capitaine&f=false D\u00e9cret no 1051 de la Convention nationale], ''Collection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des d\u00e9crets rendus par la Convention Nationale, Volume 51'', Retrieved 28 April 2012</ref> Bridport then pulled ahead in the pursuit, catching the badly damaged ''Peuple'' approximately {{convert|0.5|nmi|km}} west of Groix and firing one broadside at the French flagship and another at ''Tigre'', which Bridport was not aware had already surrendered. At 08:37, ignoring the nearby ''Peuple'' and the remainder of the French fleet scattered between Groix and the [[River La\u00efta]], Bridport turned away to the south-west followed by the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ247\"/><ref name=\"WLC263\">Clowes, p. 263</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nBridport gave instructions as he withdrew for ''Alexandre'', ''Formidable'' and ''Tigre'' to be taken under tow by [[HMS Prince (1788)|HMS ''Prince'']], [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] and [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS ''Prince George'']] respectively.<ref name=\"WLC263\"/> The British fleet was in good condition: five ships had seen no action at all and of those that had fought, only ''Queen Charlotte'' had suffered any significant damage, principally to her rigging. The British fleet had lost 31 men killed and 113 wounded; ''Queen Charlotte'' and ''Colossus'' had the heaviest casualties of 36 and 35 respectively.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> Bridport placed prize crews on the captured vessels and sent them back to Britain while turning the fleet back eastwards once it had reached a safe distance from the coast, in order to provide support for Warren's expedition to Quiberon. Warren landed the French Royalist forces at [[Carnac]] on 27 June, but the invasion ended in disaster a month later, the surviving Royalists driven back to the coast and collected by Warren.<ref name=\"WLC266\">Clowes, p. 266</ref> Bridport had remained off Quiberon to ensure that Villaret did not return to harass the expeditionary force, returning to Britain on 20 September but leaving the bulk of the blockade fleet off the Breton coast under Rear-Admiral [[Henry Harvey]]. The 68-year-old Bridport was forcibly retired in October after an unrelated argument with [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]], but was reinstated in 1796 and continued to serve in command of the Channel Fleet until 1800.<ref name=\"ODNB Hood\">{{Cite ODNB|id=13671|title=Hood, Alexander}}</ref><ref name=\"WLC267\">Clowes, p. 267</ref>\n\nVillaret meanwhile gathered his scattered ships and called a council of his senior officers on the frigate [[HMS Amelia (1796)|''Prosperine'']] to discuss their next course of action. The French admiral believed Bridport had only temporarily withdrawn and would be soon returning to continue the engagement. He therefore proposed to anchor off the Breton coast in a strong defensive position and await Bridport's attack. This scheme was vociferously opposed by Contre-amirals [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen de Tr\u00e9marec|Kerguelen]] and [[\u00c9tienne Eustache Bruix]] who argued that in such a position the British would be able to use the [[weather gage]] to bombard the French at will and attack them with [[fireships]].<ref name=\"WJ249\">James, p. 249</ref> Following their advice, Villaret decided to shelter the fleet in the nearby port of Lorient to seek supplies and repairs before returning to Brest. But he found that, having sailed without sufficient provisions, Lorient was not equipped for a fleet of such size and Villaret was forced to discharge the majority of sailors as he was unable to feed them. It was not until December and the winter storm season that a number of the ships were able to travel quietly up the coast to Brest, while others were sent southwards to [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]].<ref name=\"WJ253\">James, p. 253</ref> French casualties had been heavy, although they have not been reported other than on the captured vessels, which totaled 670 killed and wounded.<ref name=\"WJ248\">James, p. 248</ref> In the aftermath of the action, Villaret wrote a letter condemning the behaviour of a number of his officers, stating \"''Soit ignorance, soit ineptie, soit insubordination, malgr\u00e9 nos signaux r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9s, des ordres transmis par porte-voix, rien ne fut fait. Nos boulets atterissaient dans l'eau, le patriotisme \u00e0 lui seul ne peut manoeuvrer un navire''\" (\"Be it ignorance, ineptitude or insubordination, in spite of our repeated signals, nothing was done. Our shots landed in water, patriotism alone cannot manoeuvre a ship\").<ref name=\"HG214\">Granier, p. 98</ref> Several French captains were [[court-martial]]led: [[Jean-Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Aved-Magnac|Jean Magnac]] of [[French ship Z\u00e9l\u00e9 (1764)|''Z\u00e9l\u00e9'']], already blamed for the failure at Cornwallis's Retreat, was dismissed from the Navy, as was Captain Giot-Labri\u00e8re of [[French ship Fougueux (1785)|''Fougueux'']]. Captain Larr\u00e9guy of ''Mucius'' was censured for not adequately supporting ''Tigre'', and three other captains were tried but acquitted.<ref name=\"CR214\">Rouvier, p. 214</ref>\n\nIn common with the battle of the Glorious First of June the previous year,<ref name=\"WJ181\">James, p. 181</ref> rewards for the British victory at Groix were unevenly distributed. Bridport's dispatch to the Admiralty was short and lacking in detail; the only officer commended was Bridport's own flag captain [[William Domett]], whose ship had joined the action only in the last stages. The situation was worsened by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], which voted thanks for the battle but specifically named only Bridport, Lord Hugh Seymour and Vice-Admiral [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Sir Alan Gardner]] of ''Queen''. This omitted not only the numerous captains who had taken part in the battle, but also Vice-Admiral [[John Colpoys]] of ''London'', whose ship had been much more heavily engaged than Gardner's.<ref name=\"WLC265\">Clowes, p. 265</ref><ref name=\"LG1\"/> Numerous historians have commented on these unexplained omissions, [[William James (naval historian)|William James]] noting that Douglas and ''Queen Charlotte'' were particularly unfortunate in this regard as the admiral normally aboard, Rear-Admiral [[Sir Roger Curtis]], was ashore at the court-martial of Captain [[Anthony James Pye Molloy|Anthony Molloy]] and consequently the ship received no recognition despite being the most heavily engaged of any in the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ249\"/>\n\nAll three captured ships were taken into the Royal Navy. The name of ''Alexandre'' reverted to the former ''Alexander'', and although James suggests that the ship was never again fit for frontline service, this claim is refuted by ''Alexander''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s presence in the line at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1798 under Captain [[Alexander Ball]].<ref name=\"Win\">Winfield, p. 51</ref> ''Tigre'' retained her French name, while ''Formidable'', as there was already a ship by that name in the Royal Navy, became HMS ''Belleisle'', apparently due to confusion between the islands of Groix and Belle \u00cele in the aftermath of the battle.<ref name=\"WJ250\">James, p. 250</ref> ''Belleisle'' had a long and successful career, fighting at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805 under Captain [[William Hargood]].<ref name=\"ODNB Hargood\">{{Cite ODNB|id=12312|title=Hargood, Sir William}}</ref>\n\nMore controversial than the distribution of commendations was the debate over Bridport's decision to withdraw from the battle while the remainder of the French fleet was still within reach. In his official dispatch, the British admiral wrote that \"If the Enemy had not been protected and sheltered by the Land, I have every reason to believe that a much greater Number, if not all the Line of Battle ships, would have been taken or destroyed\", going on note that \"When the ships struck, the British squadron was near to some Batteries [on Groix], and in the Face of a strong Naval Port [Lorient].<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=13790|pages=673\u2013674|date=27 June 1795}}</ref> His subsequent concern for the Quiberon expeditionary convoy also demonstrates that he considered its protection his principal duty. But in the opinion of French admiral Kerguelen, ''\"S'ils avaient bien manouevr\u00e9, ils auraient pu, ou prendre tous nos vaisseaux, ou les faire p\u00e9rir \u00e0 la c\u00f4te\"'' (If [the English] had manoeuvred successfully they could have taken all our vessels, or made them perish on the coast).<ref name=\"WJ249\"/> Historians have considered this view and most agree that Bridport's retirement was premature: In 1827 James noted that the scattered remains of the French fleet could easily have been attacked by the unengaged British rear with the advantage of the weather gage,<ref name=\"WJ247\"/> while [[William Laird Clowes]] wrote in 1901 that \"We may be pretty sure that had a [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]], a [[Edward Hawke|Hawke]] or even a [[Edward Boscawen|Boscawen]] commanded on the occasion, the fleet of Villaret would have been annihilated.\"<ref name=\"WLC266\"/> Twenty-first-century historians Noel Mostert and [[Richard Woodman]] have compared Groix with the battles of [[Battle of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Naval Battle of Hy\u00e8res Islands|Hy\u00e8res]] fought during the year in the Mediterranean, where in similar circumstances another elderly admiral, [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]], had also allowed scattered and retreating French fleets to escape when they might have been destroyed.<ref name=\"NM164\">Mostert, p. 164</ref><ref name=\"RW61\">Woodman, p. 61</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Allen\n | first = Joseph\n | authorlink =\n | year = 1905\n | origyear= 1842\n | chapter =\n | title = Battles of the British Navy\n | edition = 9th\n | publisher = Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co\n | location = London\n | id =\n | oclc = 85994488\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Brenton\n | first = Edward Pelham\n | authorlink = Edward Pelham Brenton\n | year = 1837\n | origyear = 1825\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Vol. I\n | url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_LCRy8AHxwrYC\n | quote = edward pelham brenton.\n | publisher = C.

It was released at midnight film showings, art house theaters, film festivals, charity non-profit organizations, and was [[direct-to-video]].\n\n==Plot==\nNomi Malone ([[Elizabeth Berkley]]) is a young drifter who hitchhikes to Las Vegas hoping to make it as a showgirl. After being robbed by her driver, Nomi meets Molly Abrams ([[Gina Ravera]]), a costume designer who becomes her roommate. Molly invites Nomi backstage at ''Goddess'', the [[Stardust Resort & Casino|Stardust Casino]] show where she works, to meet Cristal Connors ([[Gina Gershon]]), the diva star of the casino's topless dance revue. When Nomi tells Cristal she dances at [[Cheetah's Topless Club]], Cristal derisively tells her that what she does is akin to prostitution. When Nomi is too upset to go to work that night, Molly takes her dancing at The Crave Club. Nomi is arrested after causing a fight involving James ([[Glenn Plummer]]), a bouncer at the club. James bails Nomi out of jail, but she pays him little notice. \n\nCristal and her boyfriend Zack Carey ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), the entertainment director at the Stardust, visit Cheetah's and request a [[lap dance]] from Nomi. Although the [[bisexual]] Cristal is attracted to Nomi, her request is based more on her desire to humiliate Nomi by proving she engages in [[sex work]]. Nomi reluctantly performs the lap dance after Cristal offers her $500. James happens to be at the strip club as well and witnesses the lap dance. He visits Nomi's trailer the next morning and, like Cristal, tells Nomi that what she is doing is no different from prostitution. Later Nomi and James have a brief fling; the affair ends when James gives the dance routine he choreographs for Nomi to Penny ([[Rena Riffel]]), a former coworker of Nomi's whom he gets pregnant.\n\nCristal arranges for Nomi to audition for the chorus line of ''Goddess''. Tony Moss, the show's director, humiliates Nomi by asking her to put ice on her nipples to make them hard while Cristal eagerly watches offstage. Furious, Nomi abruptly leaves the audition after scattering ice everywhere in a fit. Despite her outburst, Nomi gets the job and quits Cheetah's. Cristal further humiliates Nomi by suggesting she make a \"goodwill appearance\" at a boat trade show which turns out to be a thinly disguised form of prostitution.\n\nUndeterred, Nomi sets out to get revenge against Cristal and claim her mantle. She seduces Zack, who secures an audition for her to be Cristal's understudy. Nomi wins the role, but when Cristal threatens legal action against the [[Stardust Resort and Casino]], the offer is rescinded. After Cristal taunts her, Nomi pushes her down a flight of stairs, breaking her hip. Unable to perform, Cristal is replaced by Nomi as the show's lead. Although Nomi has finally secured the fame she sought, she alienates Molly, who realizes she pushed Cristal down the stairs.\n\nLater, Molly relents and attends Nomi's opening night celebration at a posh hotel, where she meets her idol, musician Andrew Carver. Carver lures Molly to a room where he brutally beats her and leads his bodyguards in [[gang-rape|gang-raping]] her. Molly is hospitalized after the assault. Nomi wants to report the assault to the police, but Zack tells her the Stardust will bribe Molly with [[hush money]] to protect Carver, their star performer. Zack then confronts Nomi about her sordid past: her real name is Polly, and she became a runaway and prostitute after her parents' [[murder-suicide]]. She has been arrested several times for drug possession, prostitution, and assault with a deadly weapon. Zack blackmails Nomi by vowing to keep her past quiet if she will not tell the police about the assault.\n\nUnable to obtain justice for Molly without exposing her past, Nomi decides to take justice into her own hands. She gets Carver alone in his hotel room and beats him severely. Nomi then pays two hospital visits: one to Molly to let her know that Carver's actions did not go unpunished, and another to Cristal to apologize for injuring her. Cristal admits she pulled a similar stunt years ago. Because her lawyers secure her a large cash settlement, Cristal forgives Nomi, and they exchange a kiss.

In 1997, Eszterhas said:\n<blockquote>Clearly we made mistakes. Clearly it was one of the biggest failures of our time. It failed commercially, critically, it failed on videotape, it failed internationally. . . . In retrospect, part of it was that Paul and I were coming off of ''Basic'', which defied the critics and was a huge success. Maybe there was a certain hubris involved: \"We can do what we want to do, go as far out there as we want.\" That rape scene was a god-awful mistake. In retrospect, a terrible mistake. And musically it was eminently forgettable. And in casting mistakes were made.<ref name=\"post\"/></blockquote>\nMacLachlan recalled seeing the film for the first time at the premiere:\n<blockquote>I was absolutely gobsmacked. I said, \"This is horrible. Horrible!\" And it's a very slow, sinking feeling when you're watching the movie, and the first scene comes out, and you're like, \"Oh, that's a really bad scene.\" But you say, \"Well, that's okay, the next one'll be better.\" And you somehow try to convince yourself that it's going to get better\u2026 and it just gets worse. And I was like, \"Wow. That was crazy.\" I mean, I really didn't see that coming. So at that point, I distanced myself from the movie. Now, of course, it has a whole other life as a sort of inadvertent\u2026 satire. No, \"satire\" isn't the right word. But it's inadvertently funny. So it's found its place.

It was moved to a 200-seat off-Broadway theater, XL Nightclub. The production continued to be successful, its original run was extended through July 15, 2013. Actress Rena Riffel reprised her role from the films as Penny for one month of the production.\n\nThe show closely mimics the plot of the film and often directly incorporates dialog from the film. As the title suggests, it is a musical. It is highly satirical while staying true to the campy nature of the film. It stars actress April Kidwell as Nomi. Her performance has been critically lauded. Andy Webster of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated \"The coltish April Kidwell, as Nomi, is a wonder. Amid an exhausting onslaught of often obvious ribaldry, she is tireless, fearless and performing circles around Elizabeth Berkley's portrayal in the movie. Her vibrant physicality and knowing humor are a potent riposte to the story's rabid misogyny.\"<ref name=\"The New York Times\">{{cite news | last = Webster| first = Andy| coauthors = | title = Spandex Mostly On, Those Pole Dancers Return | work = The New York Times| pages = | language = | publisher = | date = May 29, 2013 | url = http://theater.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/theater/reviews/showgirls-the-musical-at-xl-nightclub.html | accessdate = June 12, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe musical takes several characters and condenses them for stage. The characters of Marty and Gaye have been combined to one character, simply called 'Gay'. The characters of Molly and James are both portrayed by actor Marcus Deison. MacLachlan's character of Zack is simply called Kyle MacLachlan. The show features sexually explicit language and nudity throughout. The tagline is \"Singing. Dancing.

The film centers on a \"street-smart\" drifter who ventures to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and climbs the seedy hierarchy from [[Striptease|stripper]] to [[showgirl]].\n\nProduced on a then-sizable budget of approximately $45 million, significant controversy and hype surrounding the film's amounts of sex and nudity preceded its theatrical release. In the [[United States]], the film was [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rated NC-17]] for \"nudity and erotic sexuality throughout, some graphic language, and sexual violence.\" ''Showgirls'' was the first (and to date only) NC-17 rated film to be given a [[wide release]] in mainstream theaters.<ref name=\"nytimes-nc17\">{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/21/movies/first-major-film-with-an-nc-17-rating-is-embraced-by-the-studio.html |title=First Major Film With an NC-17 Rating Is Embraced by the Studio |work= The New York Times|accessdate=May 21, 2008 | first=Bernard | last=Weinraub | date=July 21, 1995 | quote = \"Showgirls\" cost $40 million to $45 million }}</ref> Distributor [[United Artists]] dispatched several hundred staffers to theaters across North America playing ''Showgirls'' to ensure that patrons would not sneak into the theater from other films, and to make sure film-goers were over the age of 17.

It was released at midnight film showings, art house theaters, film festivals, charity non-profit organizations, and was [[direct-to-video]].\n\n==Plot==\nNomi Malone ([[Elizabeth Berkley]]) is a young drifter who hitchhikes to Las Vegas hoping to make it as a showgirl. After being robbed by her driver, Nomi meets Molly Abrams ([[Gina Ravera]]), a costume designer who becomes her roommate. Molly invites Nomi backstage at ''Goddess'', the [[Stardust Resort & Casino|Stardust Casino]] show where she works, to meet Cristal Connors ([[Gina Gershon]]), the diva star of the casino's topless dance revue. When Nomi tells Cristal she dances at [[Cheetah's Topless Club]], Cristal derisively tells her that what she does is akin to prostitution. When Nomi is too upset to go to work that night, Molly takes her dancing at The Crave Club. Nomi is arrested after causing a fight involving James ([[Glenn Plummer]]), a bouncer at the club. James bails Nomi out of jail, but she pays him little notice. \n\nCristal and her boyfriend Zack Carey ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), the entertainment director at the Stardust, visit Cheetah's and request a [[lap dance]] from Nomi. Although the [[bisexual]] Cristal is attracted to Nomi, her request is based more on her desire to humiliate Nomi by proving she engages in [[sex work]]. Nomi reluctantly performs the lap dance after Cristal offers her $500. James happens to be at the strip club as well and witnesses the lap dance. He visits Nomi's trailer the next morning and, like Cristal, tells Nomi that what she is doing is no different from prostitution. Later Nomi and James have a brief fling; the affair ends when James gives the dance routine he choreographs for Nomi to Penny ([[Rena Riffel]]), a former coworker of Nomi's whom he gets pregnant.\n\nCristal arranges for Nomi to audition for the chorus line of ''Goddess''. Tony Moss, the show's director, humiliates Nomi by asking her to put ice on her nipples to make them hard while Cristal eagerly watches offstage. Furious, Nomi abruptly leaves the audition after scattering ice everywhere in a fit. Despite her outburst, Nomi gets the job and quits Cheetah's. Cristal further humiliates Nomi by suggesting she make a \"goodwill appearance\" at a boat trade show which turns out to be a thinly disguised form of prostitution.\n\nUndeterred, Nomi sets out to get revenge against Cristal and claim her mantle. She seduces Zack, who secures an audition for her to be Cristal's understudy. Nomi wins the role, but when Cristal threatens legal action against the [[Stardust Resort and Casino]], the offer is rescinded. After Cristal taunts her, Nomi pushes her down a flight of stairs, breaking her hip. Unable to perform, Cristal is replaced by Nomi as the show's lead. Although Nomi has finally secured the fame she sought, she alienates Molly, who realizes she pushed Cristal down the stairs.\n\nLater, Molly relents and attends Nomi's opening night celebration at a posh hotel, where she meets her idol, musician Andrew Carver. Carver lures Molly to a room where he brutally beats her and leads his bodyguards in [[gang-rape|gang-raping]] her. Molly is hospitalized after the assault. Nomi wants to report the assault to the police, but Zack tells her the Stardust will bribe Molly with [[hush money]] to protect Carver, their star performer. Zack then confronts Nomi about her sordid past: her real name is Polly, and she became a runaway and prostitute after her parents' [[murder-suicide]]. She has been arrested several times for drug possession, prostitution, and assault with a deadly weapon. Zack blackmails Nomi by vowing to keep her past quiet if she will not tell the police about the assault.\n\nUnable to obtain justice for Molly without exposing her past, Nomi decides to take justice into her own hands. She gets Carver alone in his hotel room and beats him severely. Nomi then pays two hospital visits: one to Molly to let her know that Carver's actions did not go unpunished, and another to Cristal to apologize for injuring her. Cristal admits she pulled a similar stunt years ago. Because her lawyers secure her a large cash settlement, Cristal forgives Nomi, and they exchange a kiss. Nomi leaves Las Vegas and hitches a ride to Los Angeles, coincidentally with the same driver who stole her possessions when she arrived, whom she robs at knifepoint.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Elizabeth Berkley]] as Nomi Malone/Polly Ann Costello\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as Zack Carey\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Cristal Connors\n* [[Glenn Plummer]] as James Smith\n* [[Robert Davi]] as Al Torres\n* [[Alan Rachins]] as Tony Moss\n* [[Gina Ravera]] as Molly Abrams\n* [[Lin Tucci]] as Henrietta \"Mama\" Bazoom\n* [[Greg Travis]] as Phil Newkirk\n* [[Al Ruscio]] as Mr. Karlman\n* [[Patrick Bristow]] as Marty Jacobsen\n* [[William Shockley (actor)|William Shockley]] as Andrew Carver\n* [[Michelle Johnston]] as Gay Carpenter\n* Pamela Anderson as Party Singer\n* Dewey Weber as Jeff\n* [[Rena Riffel]] as Penny / Hope\n* Melissa Williams as Julie\n* Ungela Brockman as Angie\n* Melinda Songer as Nikki\n* [[Bobbie Phillips]] as Dee\n* [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] as ''Goddess'' dancer\n}}\n\n==Production==\nEszterhas came up with the idea for ''Showgirls'' while on vacation at his home in [[Maui, Hawaii]].

This, along with the scripts for both Verhoeven's previous film ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992) and ''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]'' (1993; also an [[erotic thriller]] starring [[Sharon Stone]]), made Eszterhas the highest paid screenwriter in Hollywood history.<ref name=\"Nerve\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nerve.com/filmlounge/interview/joeeszterhas|title=The Nerve Interview: Joe Eszterhas|publisher=[[Nerve (website)|Nerve.com]]|date=September 15, 2006|accessdate=April 11, 2014}}</ref> Verhoeven deferred 70% of his $6 million director's fee depending on if the film turned a profit.<ref name=\"Keesey\"/>\n\n\"I wrote ''Showgirls'' at the single most turbulent moment of my life,\" said Eszterhas later. \"The stuff I've done since then has more warmth, more humor, is more upbeat.\"<ref name=\"post\"/>\n\nA long list of actresses were considered for the role of Nomi Malone including [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Vanessa Marcil]], [[Jenny McCarthy]], [[Denise Richards]], and [[Charlize Theron]], but they all turned it down before [[Elizabeth Berkley]], following the cancellation of ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'', signed on to play the role.

MacLachlan recalled, \"That was a decision that was sort of a tough one to make, but I was enchanted with Paul Verhoeven. Particularly ''[[Robocop]]'', which I loved ...

In 1997, Eszterhas said:\n<blockquote>Clearly we made mistakes. Clearly it was one of the biggest failures of our time. It failed commercially, critically, it failed on videotape, it failed internationally. . . . In retrospect, part of it was that Paul and I were coming off of ''Basic'', which defied the critics and was a huge success. Maybe there was a certain hubris involved: \"We can do what we want to do, go as far out there as we want.\" That rape scene was a god-awful mistake. In retrospect, a terrible mistake. And musically it was eminently forgettable. And in casting mistakes were made.<ref name=\"post\"/></blockquote>\nMacLachlan recalled seeing the film for the first time at the premiere:\n<blockquote>I was absolutely gobsmacked. I said, \"This is horrible. Horrible!\" And it's a very slow, sinking feeling when you're watching the movie, and the first scene comes out, and you're like, \"Oh, that's a really bad scene.\" But you say, \"Well, that's okay, the next one'll be better.\" And you somehow try to convince yourself that it's going to get better\u2026 and it just gets worse. And I was like, \"Wow. That was crazy.\" I mean, I really didn't see that coming. So at that point, I distanced myself from the movie. Now, of course, it has a whole other life as a sort of inadvertent\u2026 satire. No, \"satire\" isn't the right word. But it's inadvertently funny. So it's found its place. It provides entertainment, though not in the way I think it was originally intended. It was just\u2026 maybe the wrong material with the wrong director and the wrong cast.<ref name=\"av\"/><ref name=\"post\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/10/25/sleazy-writer/7b99825a-9214-4cb3-ae2c-d80cbb243fa8/?noredirect=on|newspaper=The Washington Post|title=Sleazy Writer|first=Sharon|last=Waxman|date=October 25, 1997 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''Showgirls'' was universally derided by film critics.

Andy Webster of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated \"The coltish April Kidwell, as Nomi, is a wonder.

She served as president of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] from 1875 to 1876 and served as either Chair of the Executive Committee or Vice President for over twenty years. During the 1876 convention, she successfully argued against a group of police who claimed the association was holding an illegal assembly. They left without pressing charges.{{sfn|Snodgrass|2015|p=}}\n\nGage was considered to be more radical than either [[Susan B. Anthony]] or [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] (with whom she wrote ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]],{{sfn|Gordon|1990|p=499}} and Declaration of the Rights of Women'').{{sfn|Schenken|1999|p=287}} Along with Stanton, she was a vocal critic of the [[Christian Church]], which put her at odds with conservative suffragists such as [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]. Rather than arguing that women deserved the vote because their feminine morality would then properly influence legislation (as the WCTU did), she argued that they deserved suffrage as a 'natural right'. Despite her opposition to the Church, Gage was in her own way deeply religious, and she joined Stanton's Revising Committee to write ''[[The Woman's Bible]]''.\n\n==Writer and editor==\nGage was well-educated and a prolific writer\u2014the most gifted and educated woman of her age, claimed her devoted son-in-law, [[L.

In 1878, she bought the ''Ballot Box'', the monthly journal of a [[Toledo, Ohio]], suffrage association, when its editor, Sarah R. L. Williams, decided to retire. Gage turned it into ''The National Citizen and Ballot Box'', explaining her intentions for the paper thus:\n\n{{quote|text=Its especial object will be to secure national protection to women citizens in the exercise of their rights to vote ... it will oppose Class Legislation of whatever form ...

Gage wrote clearly, logically, and often with a dry wit and a well-honed sense of irony.

Gage ensured that every woman in her area ([[Fayetteville, New York]]) had the opportunity to vote by writing letters making them aware of their rights, and sitting at the polls making sure nobody was turned away. In 1871, Gage was part of a group of 10 women who attempted to vote. Reportedly, she stood by and argued with the polling officials on behalf of each individual woman. She supported [[Victoria Woodhull]] and (later) [[Ulysses S Grant]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1872|1872 presidential election]]. In 1873 she defended Susan B. Anthony when Anthony was placed on trial for having voted in that election, making compelling legal and moral arguments.<ref>United States. Circuit Court (New York : Northern District).

Susan B. Anthony, who had helped to found the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA), was primarily concerned with gaining the vote, an outlook which Gage found too narrow. Conservative suffragists were drawn into the suffrage movement believing women's vote would achieve temperance and Christian political goals. These women were not in support of general social reform. The [[American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA)]], part of the conservative wing of the suffrage movement (and formerly at odds with the National), was open to the prospect of merging with the NWSA under Anthony, while Anthony was working toward unifying the suffrage movement under the single goal of gaining the vote. The merger of the two organizations, pushed through by [[Lucy Stone]], [[Alice Stone Blackwell]] and Anthony, produced the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) in 1890. Stanton and Gage maintained their radical positions and opposed the merger of the two suffrage associations because they believed it was a threat to separation of church and state. The successful merger of the two suffrage groups prompted Gage to establish the [[Woman's National Liberal Union]] (WNLU) in 1890, of which she was president until her death (by stroke) in 1898. Attracting more radical members than NAWSA, the WNLU became the platform for radical and liberal ideas of the time. Gage became the editor of the official journal of the WNLU, ''The Liberal Thinker''.\n\nGage was an avid opponent of the Christian church as controlled by men, having analyzed centuries of Christian practices as degrading and oppressive to women.{{sfn|Clark|1986|p=394}}{{sfn|Harrison|2007|pp=278-9}}{{sfn|Hamlin|2014|p=49}} She saw the Christian church as central to the process of men subjugating women, a process in which church doctrine and authority were used to portray women as morally inferior and inherently sinful. She strongly supported the [[separation of church and state]], believing \"that the greatest injury to women arose from theological laws that subjugated woman to man.\" She wrote in October 1881:\n\n{{quote|text=Believing this country to be a political and not a religious organisation ... the editor of the ''National Citizen'' will use all her influence of voice and pen against \"Sabbath Laws\", the uses of the \"Bible in School\", and pre-eminently against an amendment which shall introduce \"God in the Constitution\".|title=\"God in the Constitution\"|source=page 2}}\n\nIn 1893, she published ''Woman, Church and State'', a book that outlined the variety of ways in which Christianity had oppressed women and reinforced [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] systems. It was wide-ranging and built extensively upon arguments and ideas she had previously put forth in speeches (and in a chapter of ''History of Woman Suffrage'' which bore the same name). Gage became a [[Theosophist]], and the last two years of her life, her thoughts were concentrated upon metaphysical subjects, and the phenomena and philosophy of Spiritualism and Theosophical studies. During her critical illness in 1896, she experienced some illuminations that intensified her interest in psychical research. She had great interest in the occult mysteries of Theosophy and other Eastern speculations as to reincarnation and the illimitable creative power of man.{{sfn|Green|1898|p=337}}\n\nLike many other suffragists, Gage considered [[abortion]] a regrettable tragedy, although her views on the subject were more complex than simple opposition. In 1868, she wrote a letter to ''The Revolution'' (a women's rights paper edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and [[Parker Pillsbury]]), supporting the view that abortion was an institution supported, dominated and furthered by men. Gage opposed abortion on principle, blaming it on the 'selfish desire' of husbands to maintain their wealth by reducing their offspring:\n\n{{quote|text=The short article on \"Child Murder\" in your paper of March 12 that touched a subject which lies deeper down in woman's wrongs than any other. This is the denial of the right to herself ... nowhere has the marital union of the sexes been one in which woman has had control over her own body. Enforced motherhood is a crime against the body of the mother and the soul of the child. ... But the crime of abortion is not one in which the guilt lies solely or even chiefly with the woman. ... I hesitate not to assert that most of this crime of \"child murder\", \"abortion\", \"infanticide\", lies at the door of the male sex. Many a woman has laughed a silent, derisive laugh at the decisions of eminent medical and legal authorities, in cases of crimes committed against her as a woman. Never, until she sits as juror on such trials, will or can just decisions be rendered.|sign=Matilda Joslyn Gage|source=\"Is Woman Her Own?\"}}\n\nGage was quite concerned with the rights of a woman over her own life and body. In 1881 she wrote, on the subject of [[divorce]]:\n\n{{quote|text=When they preach as does Rev. Crummell, of \"the hidden mystery of generation, the wondrous secret of propagated life, committed to the trust of woman,\" they bring up a self-evident fact of nature which needs no other inspiration, to show the world that the mother, and not the father, is the true head of the family, and that she should be able to free herself from the adulterous husband, keeping her own body a holy temple for its divine-human uses, of which as priestess and holder of the altar she alone should have control.|sign=Matilda Joslyn Gage|source=\"A Sermon Against Woman\"}}\n\nOther feminists of the period referred to \"voluntary motherhood,\" achieved through consensual nonprocreative sexual practices, periodic or permanent sexual abstinence, or (most importantly) the right of a woman (especially a wife) to refuse sex.<ref name=\"whaoitegj\">{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=Linda|title=Voluntary Motherhood; The Beginnings of Feminist Birth Control Ideas in the United States|journal=Feminist Studies|date=Winter\u2013Spring 1973|volume=1|issue=3/4|pages=5\u201322|jstor=1566477}}</ref>\n\nWorks about [[Native Americans in the United States]] by [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] and [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]] also influenced Gage.  She decried the brutal treatment of Native Americans in her writings and public speeches. She was angered that the [[Federal government of the United States]] attempted to impose citizenship upon Native Americans thereby negating their ([[Iroquois]]) status as a separate nation and their treaty privileges. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nShe wrote in 1878:\n\n{{quote|text=That the Indians have been oppressed - are now, is true, but the United States has treaties with them, recognising them as distinct political communities, and duty towards them demands ''not an enforced citizenship'' but a faithful living up to its obligations on the part of the government.|sign= Matilda Joslyn Gage|source= \"Indian Citizenship\"<ref>Gage, Matilda E.J.

She is the [[eponym]] for the [[Matilda effect|Matilda Effect]], which describes the tendency to deny women credit for scientific invention.\n\nShe was the youngest speaker{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} at the 1852 [[National Women's Rights Convention]] held in [[Syracuse, New York]]. She was a tireless worker and public speaker, and contributed numerous articles to the press, being regarded as \"one of the most logical, fearless and scientific writers of her day\". During 1878\u20131881, she published and edited at Syracuse the ''National Citizen'', a paper devoted to the cause of women. In 1880, she was a delegate from the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] to the Republican and Greenback conventions in [[Chicago]] and the Democratic convention in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. With [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]], she was for years in the forefront of the suffrage movement, and collaborated with them in writing the ''History of Woman Suffrage'' (1881\u20131887). She was the author of the ''Woman's Rights Catechism'' (1868); ''Woman as Inventor'' (1870); ''Who Planned the Tennessee Campaign'' (1880); and ''Woman, Church and State'' (1893).{{sfn|White|1921|p=244}}\n\nGage served as president of the New York State Suffrage Association for five years, and president of the National Woman's Suffrage Association during 1875\u201376, which was one of the affiliating societies forming the national suffrage association, in 1890; she also held the office of second vice-president, vice-president-at-large and chairman of the executive committee of the original National Woman Suffrage Association.{{sfn|White|1921|p=244}}\n\nGage's views on suffrage and feminism were considered too radical by many members of the suffrage association, and in consequence, she organized in 1890 the [[Woman's National Liberal Union]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=WOMEN\u2019S NATIONAL LIBERAL UNION REPORT OF THE CONVENTION FOR ORGANIZATION|last=Gage|first=Matilda Joslyn|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> whose objects were: To assert woman's natural right to self-government; to show the cause of delay in the recognition of her demand; to preserve the principles of civil and religious liberty; to arouse public opinion to the danger of a union of church and state through an amendment to the constitution, and to denounce the doctrine of woman's inferiority. She served as president of this union from its inception until her death in Chicago, in 1898.{{sfn|White|1921|p=244}}\n\n==Early years and education==\nMatilda Electa Joslyn was born in [[Cicero, New York]], March 24, 1826. Her parents were Dr. [[Hezekiah Joslyn|Hezekiah]] and Helen (Leslie) Joslyn.

She served as president of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] from 1875 to 1876 and served as either Chair of the Executive Committee or Vice President for over twenty years. During the 1876 convention, she successfully argued against a group of police who claimed the association was holding an illegal assembly. They left without pressing charges.{{sfn|Snodgrass|2015|p=}}\n\nGage was considered to be more radical than either [[Susan B. Anthony]] or [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] (with whom she wrote ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]],{{sfn|Gordon|1990|p=499}} and Declaration of the Rights of Women'').{{sfn|Schenken|1999|p=287}} Along with Stanton, she was a vocal critic of the [[Christian Church]], which put her at odds with conservative suffragists such as [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]. Rather than arguing that women deserved the vote because their feminine morality would then properly influence legislation (as the WCTU did), she argued that they deserved suffrage as a 'natural right'. Despite her opposition to the Church, Gage was in her own way deeply religious, and she joined Stanton's Revising Committee to write ''[[The Woman's Bible]]''.\n\n==Writer and editor==\nGage was well-educated and a prolific writer\u2014the most gifted and educated woman of her age, claimed her devoted son-in-law, [[L. Frank Baum]]. She corresponded with numerous newspapers, reporting on developments in the [[women's suffrage|woman suffrage]] movement. In 1878, she bought the ''Ballot Box'', the monthly journal of a [[Toledo, Ohio]], suffrage association, when its editor, Sarah R. L. Williams, decided to retire. Gage turned it into ''The National Citizen and Ballot Box'', explaining her intentions for the paper thus:\n\n{{quote|text=Its especial object will be to secure national protection to women citizens in the exercise of their rights to vote ... it will oppose Class Legislation of whatever form ...

Each edition bore the words '[[The pen is mightier than the sword|The Pen Is Mightier Than The Sword]]', and included regular columns about prominent women in history and female inventors. Gage wrote clearly, logically, and often with a dry wit and a well-honed sense of irony. Writing about laws which allowed a man to will his children to a guardian unrelated to their mother, Gage observed:\n\n{{quote|text=It is sometimes better to be a dead man than a live woman.|sign=Matilda Joslyn Gage|source=\"All The Rights I Want\"<ref>Gage, Matilda E.

Gage ensured that every woman in her area ([[Fayetteville, New York]]) had the opportunity to vote by writing letters making them aware of their rights, and sitting at the polls making sure nobody was turned away. In 1871, Gage was part of a group of 10 women who attempted to vote. Reportedly, she stood by and argued with the polling officials on behalf of each individual woman. She supported [[Victoria Woodhull]] and (later) [[Ulysses S Grant]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1872|1872 presidential election]]. In 1873 she defended Susan B. Anthony when Anthony was placed on trial for having voted in that election, making compelling legal and moral arguments.<ref>United States. Circuit Court (New York : Northern District).

Susan B. Anthony, who had helped to found the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA), was primarily concerned with gaining the vote, an outlook which Gage found too narrow. Conservative suffragists were drawn into the suffrage movement believing women's vote would achieve temperance and Christian political goals. These women were not in support of general social reform. The [[American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA)]], part of the conservative wing of the suffrage movement (and formerly at odds with the National), was open to the prospect of merging with the NWSA under Anthony, while Anthony was working toward unifying the suffrage movement under the single goal of gaining the vote. The merger of the two organizations, pushed through by [[Lucy Stone]], [[Alice Stone Blackwell]] and Anthony, produced the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) in 1890. Stanton and Gage maintained their radical positions and opposed the merger of the two suffrage associations because they believed it was a threat to separation of church and state. The successful merger of the two suffrage groups prompted Gage to establish the [[Woman's National Liberal Union]] (WNLU) in 1890, of which she was president until her death (by stroke) in 1898. Attracting more radical members than NAWSA, the WNLU became the platform for radical and liberal ideas of the time. Gage became the editor of the official journal of the WNLU, ''The Liberal Thinker''.\n\nGage was an avid opponent of the Christian church as controlled by men, having analyzed centuries of Christian practices as degrading and oppressive to women.{{sfn|Clark|1986|p=394}}{{sfn|Harrison|2007|pp=278-9}}{{sfn|Hamlin|2014|p=49}} She saw the Christian church as central to the process of men subjugating women, a process in which church doctrine and authority were used to portray women as morally inferior and inherently sinful. She strongly supported the [[separation of church and state]], believing \"that the greatest injury to women arose from theological laws that subjugated woman to man.\" She wrote in October 1881:\n\n{{quote|text=Believing this country to be a political and not a religious organisation ... the editor of the ''National Citizen'' will use all her influence of voice and pen against \"Sabbath Laws\", the uses of the \"Bible in School\", and pre-eminently against an amendment which shall introduce \"God in the Constitution\".|title=\"God in the Constitution\"|source=page 2}}\n\nIn 1893, she published ''Woman, Church and State'', a book that outlined the variety of ways in which Christianity had oppressed women and reinforced [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] systems. It was wide-ranging and built extensively upon arguments and ideas she had previously put forth in speeches (and in a chapter of ''History of Woman Suffrage'' which bore the same name). Gage became a [[Theosophist]], and the last two years of her life, her thoughts were concentrated upon metaphysical subjects, and the phenomena and philosophy of Spiritualism and Theosophical studies. During her critical illness in 1896, she experienced some illuminations that intensified her interest in psychical research. She had great interest in the occult mysteries of Theosophy and other Eastern speculations as to reincarnation and the illimitable creative power of man.{{sfn|Green|1898|p=337}}\n\nLike many other suffragists, Gage considered [[abortion]] a regrettable tragedy, although her views on the subject were more complex than simple opposition. In 1868, she wrote a letter to ''The Revolution'' (a women's rights paper edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and [[Parker Pillsbury]]), supporting the view that abortion was an institution supported, dominated and furthered by men. Gage opposed abortion on principle, blaming it on the 'selfish desire' of husbands to maintain their wealth by reducing their offspring:\n\n{{quote|text=The short article on \"Child Murder\" in your paper of March 12 that touched a subject which lies deeper down in woman's wrongs than any other. This is the denial of the right to herself ... nowhere has the marital union of the sexes been one in which woman has had control over her own body. Enforced motherhood is a crime against the body of the mother and the soul of the child. ... But the crime of abortion is not one in which the guilt lies solely or even chiefly with the woman. ... I hesitate not to assert that most of this crime of \"child murder\", \"abortion\", \"infanticide\", lies at the door of the male sex. Many a woman has laughed a silent, derisive laugh at the decisions of eminent medical and legal authorities, in cases of crimes committed against her as a woman. Never, until she sits as juror on such trials, will or can just decisions be rendered.|sign=Matilda Joslyn Gage|source=\"Is Woman Her Own?\"}}\n\nGage was quite concerned with the rights of a woman over her own life and body. In 1881 she wrote, on the subject of [[divorce]]:\n\n{{quote|text=When they preach as does Rev. Crummell, of \"the hidden mystery of generation, the wondrous secret of propagated life, committed to the trust of woman,\" they bring up a self-evident fact of nature which needs no other inspiration, to show the world that the mother, and not the father, is the true head of the family, and that she should be able to free herself from the adulterous husband, keeping her own body a holy temple for its divine-human uses, of which as priestess and holder of the altar she alone should have control.|sign=Matilda Joslyn Gage|source=\"A Sermon Against Woman\"}}\n\nOther feminists of the period referred to \"voluntary motherhood,\" achieved through consensual nonprocreative sexual practices, periodic or permanent sexual abstinence, or (most importantly) the right of a woman (especially a wife) to refuse sex.<ref name=\"whaoitegj\">{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=Linda|title=Voluntary Motherhood; The Beginnings of Feminist Birth Control Ideas in the United States|journal=Feminist Studies|date=Winter\u2013Spring 1973|volume=1|issue=3/4|pages=5\u201322|jstor=1566477}}</ref>\n\nWorks about [[Native Americans in the United States]] by [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] and [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]] also influenced Gage.  She decried the brutal treatment of Native Americans in her writings and public speeches. She was angered that the [[Federal government of the United States]] attempted to impose citizenship upon Native Americans thereby negating their ([[Iroquois]]) status as a separate nation and their treaty privileges. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nShe wrote in 1878:\n\n{{quote|text=That the Indians have been oppressed - are now, is true, but the United States has treaties with them, recognising them as distinct political communities, and duty towards them demands ''not an enforced citizenship'' but a faithful living up to its obligations on the part of the government.|sign= Matilda Joslyn Gage|source= \"Indian Citizenship\"<ref>Gage, Matilda E.J.

However, a few minutes after the initial announcement, Gage started laughing, apparently realizing that her emphasis on all individuals making up their own minds was not lost on her headstrong daughter, who gave up a chance at a law career when the opportunity for women was rare. Gage spent six months of every year with Maud and Frank.
