This launch was dubbed a [[Kosmos satellite]] mission because that was the designation given to prototype satellites by the Soviet Union. Kosmos 122 was the first announced Russian meteorological satellite and the last in a series of prototype meteorological satellites that included [[Kosmos 44]] (28 August 1964), [[Kosmos 58]] (26 February 1965), [[Kosmos 100]] (17 December 1965), and [[Kosmos 118]] (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Cosmos\">{{cite web|title=Cosmos 122: Display 1966-057A|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1966-057A|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|date=27 February 2020|accessdate=30 March 2020}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> It was the last meteorological satellite launched from the Baikonur site with a Vostok 2M launch vehicle at an orbital inclination of 65.0\u00b0, and it provided a transition from the prototype series to the Kosmos \"Meteor\" experimental weather satellite system.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/> The deployment of two other satellites, [[Kosmos 144]] (28 February 1967) and [[Kosmos 156]] (27 April 1967), helped create the first Soviet [[weather forecasting]] network.<ref name=\"Springer\">Meteorological Satellite Systems, 1.

Web. 17 April 2016.</ref> These satellites were used until 1969 when they were replaced with an upgraded model officially called [[Meteor (satellite)|Meteor]].<ref name=\"Springer\"/>\n\n==Spacecraft==\n\nThe satellite was in the form of a large cylindrical capsule, {{convert|5|m}} long and {{convert|1.5|m}} in diameter. Two large solar cell panels of three segments each were deployed from opposite sides of the cylinder after satellite separation from the launch vehicle. The solar panels were rotated to constantly face the sun during satellite daytime by means of a sun sensor-controlled drive mechanism fitted in the top end of the center body.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\nThe meteorological instruments were housed in a hermetically sealed compartment located in the lower part of the capsule, while the basic satellite servicing systems were contained in a special hermetically sealed compartment in the upper part of the capsule. Data were transmitted to earth at a frequency of 90 MHz by means of a steerable high-gain parabolic antenna that was attached to the center section of the satellite body by a long arm. The satellite was triaxially stabilized by a series of inertial flywheels, driven by electric motors, whose kinetic energy was dampened by torques produced by electromagnets interacting with the earth's magnetic field.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\nKosmos 122 was oriented by Earth sensors with one of its axes directed earthward along the local vertical, a second oriented along the orbital velocity vector, and a third oriented perpendicular to the orbital plane. This orientation ensured that the optical axes of the instruments were constantly directed earthward.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\n==Instruments==\n\nThe instrumentation consisted of two vidicon cameras for daytime cloud cover pictures, a high-resolution scanning infrared (IR) radiometer for nighttime and daytime imaging of the Earth and clouds, and an array of narrow-angle and wide-angle radiometers for measuring the intensity of radiation reflected from the clouds and oceans, the surface temperatures of the Earth and cloud tops, and the total flux of thermal energy from the Earth-atmosphere system into space, respectively. The experiment terminated operations in October 1966.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Instrument <ref name=\"Hendrickx\"/> !! Number of Spectral Bands !!

The instrumentation consisted of two identical vidicon cameras that were mounted in the satellite base and were directed toward the Earth. Each camera viewed a 500 by 500 km area \u2014 one to the left and the other to the right of nadir \u2014 with a resolution of {{convert|1.25|km}} at nadir from a satellite altitude of {{convert|600|km}} to {{convert|700|km}}. The cameras took a one-frame image of the Earth's cloud cover with slight overlapping of successive frames to provide continuous coverage. The cameras switched on automatically any time the sun was more than 5\u00b0 above the horizon. Because the Earth illumination varied so much, automatic sensors adjusted the camera apertures to produce high-quality pictures under a variety of illumination conditions. The image formed by each vidicon tube either was transmitted directly to the ground if the satellite was in radio contact with one of two ground stations or was recorded on magnetic tape for later transmission if the satellite was beyond the zone of radio communication.<ref name=\"Experiment1\">{{cite web|title=Cosmos 122: Experiment 1966-057A-01 |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1966-057A-01|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|date=27 February 2020|accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe TV images received by these ground stations were processed and transmitted to the Hydrometeorological Center in Moscow, where they were analyzed and used in various forecast and analysis products. The pictures were archived at the Hydrometeorological Center. The Kosmos 122 cameras, although having 2.5 times the resolution of those carried on the ESSA satellites, could not provide continuous overlapping global coverage as do the ESSA cameras owing to the lower orbit of the Kosmos 122 satellite ({{convert|650|km}} compared to {{convert|1400|km}}). Thus, to close the gaps in coverage, at least two satellites were required in the weather satellite system. In addition, cloud cover mosaics were produced from 10 or more individual cloud cover pictures at the Hydrometeorological Center to provide a more comprehensive view of global weather systems.<ref name=\"Experiment1\"/>\n\nSome of the individual pictures and the cloud mosaics were transmitted to various foreign meteorological centers as part of an international meteorological data exchange program. The United States received some of these pictures at the National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS) in Suitland, Maryland, via the \"cold line\" facsimile link with Moscow. Pictures were transmitted to NESS from September 11, 1966, through October 26, 1966. These pictures were archived at NESS for 1 yr and then, unless of unusual interest, were discarded.<ref name=\"Experiment1\"/>\n\n===Scanning high-resolution infrared radiometer===\n\nThe Kosmos 122 high-resolution scanning [[infrared]] (IR) radiometer was designed to make measurements of cloud distribution and snow and ice cover on the dayside and nightside of the earth. The radiometer measured the outgoing radiation from the Earth-atmosphere system in the 8 to 12-\u00b5m atmospheric window. Measurements made in this spectral region permitted the construction of brightness patterns of the thermal relief and determination of equivalent radiation temperatures of the earth's surface and cloud tops. The instrument was a narrow-angle scanning radiometer with an instantaneous viewing angle of 1.5 x 1.5\u00b0. It was mounted in the base of the satellite in a sealed instrument compartment with its optical axis directed along the local vertical and toward nadir. The radiometer measured the intensity of the outgoing radiation by comparing the Earth's radiation flux with the radiation flux from space. Each type of radiation entered the radiometer through separate windows, which were oriented in mutually perpendicular directions. The radiation from the Earth-atmosphere system fell on a plane scanning mirror that was mounted at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the satellite velocity vector and scanned through an angle of plus or minus 50\u00b0 from nadir.<ref name=\"Experiment2\">{{cite web|title=Cosmos 122: Experiment 1966-057A-02|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1966-057A-02 |website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|date=27 February 2020|accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe radiation was reflected from the scanning mirror through a stationary modulating disk and filter window onto a parabolic mirror that focused the parallel beam through a movable modulating disk onto a thermistor bolometer. The stationary and movable modulating disks provided the channel switching, sending first the Earth-atmosphere radiation and then the space radiation to the parabolic mirror and finally to the bolometer. The bolometer converted the radiant flux into variable electric voltages (0 to 6 V) whose frequency was equal to the modulator frequency and whose magnitudes were proportional to the differences in the radiant flux intensities between Earth and space developed at the bolometer output. During the movement of the scanning mirror through a plus or minus 40\u00b0 sector, line scanning (40 lines/min) of the target area was accomplished in a plane normal to the orbital plane using a forward and back path, while scanning along the flight path was provided by the relative motion of the satellite with respect to the earth. In each scan, with the indicated viewing and scanning angles from the satellite's orbital altitude, the radiometer recorded the mean radiation intensities from a band about {{convert|1100|km}} wide with a resolution of about {{convert|15|km}} at nadir to about {{convert|24|km}} to {{convert|27|km}} at the edges. The radiometer was capable of measuring radiation temperatures within 2 to 3\u00b0 for temperatures above 273 K and within 7 to 8\u00b0 for temperatures below 273 K.<ref name=\"Experiment2\"/>\n\nThe video signals were amplified and sent either to the satellite memory unit for later transmission or to the radiotelemetry unit for direct transmission to Earth, depending on whether the satellite was beyond or within the zone of radio communication with a ground receiving station, respectively. The ground receivers recorded the transmitted data in digital form on magnetic tape and simultaneously on 80-mm photographic film in the form of a brightness image of the thermal relief of the Earth-atmosphere system. The data on magnetic tape were processed by computer at the Soviet Hydrometeorological Center and were used to produce a digital map of the equivalent radiation temperature field with a superposed geographic grid. The photographic film was developed and processed into an IR picture also with a superposed grid. The pictures were archived at the Hydrometeorological Center. Some of these pictures were transmitted to various foreign meteorological centers as part of an international meteorological data exchange program. The United States received these pictures at the National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS), Suitland, Maryland, via the \"cold line\" facsimile link with Moscow. Pictures were transmitted to NESS from mid-September until late October 1966. These IR pictures were kept at NESS for 1 yr and then, unless of unusual interest, were discarded.<ref name=\"Experiment2\"/>\n\n===Actinometric instrument===\n\nThe Kosmos 122 actinometric experiment was designed to measure the outgoing longwave [[radiation]] (3 to 30 \u00b5m) from the Earth-atmosphere system, the outgoing near [[ultraviolet]] (UV), visible, and near-[[infrared]] (IR) solar radiation (0.3 to 3 \u00b5m) reflected and backscattered by the Earth-atmosphere system, and the effective radiation temperature of the Earth's surface and cloud tops (8 to 12 \u00b5m).<ref name=\"Experiment3\">{{cite web|title=Cosmos 122: Experiment 1966-057A-03|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1966-057A-03|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA|date=27 February 2020|accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe instrumentation consisted of four radiometers: a pair of scanning, narrow-angle, two-channel [[radiometers]] and a pair of nonscanning, wide-angle, two-channel radiometers. The narrow-angle (4 by 5\u00b0 field of view (FOV)) radiometers measured radiation in all three spectral bands, while the wide-angle (136 to 140\u00b0 FOV) radiometers operated only in the 0.3 to 3-\u00b5m and 3 to 30-\u00b5m bands. In the narrow-angle radiometer, the 0.3 to 3-\u00b5m band was measured in one channel and the 8 to 12-\u00b5m and 3 to 30-\u00b5m bands were combined in the second channel. In the second channel, the two bands were separated by the exchange of corresponding filters as the radiometer scanned in alternate directions.<ref name=\"Experiment3\"/>\n\nThe Earth radiation entered the narrow-angle radiometer through a cylindrical fairing (KRS-5 crystal) and fell onto a conical scanning mirror. The radiation was reflected from the mirror through a three-lobed rotating mirror chopper that modulated the radiation flux at a frequency of 80 Hz. The chopper alternately reflected Earth radiation and space radiation, which entered through a separate KRS-5 crystal window, onto one of three openings in a color filter wheel -- one filter for each spectral band. The particular spectral band that was passed through then fell on an off-axis parabolic mirror that focused the radiation flux onto a bolometric receiver. Periodic calibration was made when the scanning mirror moved to a 90\u00b0 angle from nadir with simultaneous turning on and viewing of a [[silicon]] standard lamp.<ref name=\"Experiment3\"/>\n\nThe 0.3 to 3-\u00b5m channel did not use the two-beam system or filter switching. The output from the modulated flow of radiation on the bolometer was amplified, rectified, filtered, and fed into the radio-telemetry system over eight channels. The wide-angle radiometers had identical optical systems for both channels. The Earth radiation entered the radiometer through a hemispherical shell composed of quartz or KRS-5 crystal with a coating that determined the passband. The radiation was then modulated with a frequency of 64 Hz and fell on a bolometric receiver. As in the narrow-angle radiometers, the bolometer output was processed and fed into the radio-telemetry system. The wide-angle radiometer was standardized simultaneously with the narrow-angle radiometers by the input of a standard 64 Hz calibrating frequency into the amplification circuit.<ref name=\"Experiment3\"/>\n\nThe relative RMS measuring error for both types of radiometers was about 0.5%. To provide a backup capability, one wide-angle and one narrow-angle radiometer were held in reserve and could have been activated on command from the ground. The orientation of the Kosmos 122 satellite insured that the primary optical axes of the radiometers were oriented vertically downward toward nadir. The survey of the Earth's surface by both radiometers was carried out by the motion of the satellite relative to the Earth. In addition, the narrow-angle radiometer scanned 66\u00b0 to either side of nadir in a plane normal to the orbital plane by rocking the scanning mirror about the optical axis. The radiometers covered a strip about 2500 km wide on the Earth's surface and had a ground resolution of 50 km at nadir.<ref name=\"Experiment3\"/>\n\nThe data were reduced at the ground stations and were transmitted in binary form to the Hydrometeorological Center in Moscow, where they were recorded in digital form on magnetic tape and were used to produce various analysis products such as Earth-atmosphere albedo charts and radiation temperature maps. The data were archived at the Hydrometeorological Center.

This launch was dubbed a [[Kosmos satellite]] mission because that was the designation given to prototype satellites by the Soviet Union. Kosmos 122 was the first announced Russian meteorological satellite and the last in a series of prototype meteorological satellites that included [[Kosmos 44]] (28 August 1964), [[Kosmos 58]] (26 February 1965), [[Kosmos 100]] (17 December 1965), and [[Kosmos 118]] (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Cosmos\">{{cite web|title=Cosmos 122: Display 1966-057A |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1966-057A|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|date=27 February 2020|accessdate=30 March 2020}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> It was the last meteorological satellite launched from the Baikonur site with a Vostok 2M launch vehicle at an orbital inclination of 65.0\u00b0, and it provided a transition from the prototype series to the Kosmos \"Meteor\" experimental weather satellite system.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/> The deployment of two other satellites, [[Kosmos 144]] (28 February 1967) and [[Kosmos 156]] (27 April 1967), helped create the first Soviet [[weather forecasting]] network.<ref name=\"Springer\">Meteorological Satellite Systems, 1.

Space Chronicle: JBIS 57 (2004): pp. 56-102. Web. 17 April 2016.</ref> These satellites were used until 1969 when they were replaced with an upgraded model officially called [[Meteor (satellite)|Meteor]].<ref name=\"Springer\"/>\n\n==Spacecraft==\n\nThe satellite was in the form of a large cylindrical capsule, {{convert|5|m}} long and {{convert|1.5|m}} in diameter. Two large solar cell panels of three segments each were deployed from opposite sides of the cylinder after satellite separation from the launch vehicle. The solar panels were rotated to constantly face the sun during satellite daytime by means of a sun sensor-controlled drive mechanism fitted in the top end of the center body.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\nThe meteorological instruments were housed in a hermetically sealed compartment located in the lower part of the capsule, while the basic satellite servicing systems were contained in a special hermetically sealed compartment in the upper part of the capsule. Data were transmitted to earth at a frequency of 90 MHz by means of a steerable high-gain parabolic antenna that was attached to the center section of the satellite body by a long arm. The satellite was triaxially stabilized by a series of inertial flywheels, driven by electric motors, whose kinetic energy was dampened by torques produced by electromagnets interacting with the earth's magnetic field.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\nKosmos 122 was oriented by Earth sensors with one of its axes directed earthward along the local vertical, a second oriented along the orbital velocity vector, and a third oriented perpendicular to the orbital plane. This orientation ensured that the optical axes of the instruments were constantly directed earthward.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\n==Instruments==\n\nThe instrumentation consisted of two vidicon cameras for daytime cloud cover pictures, a high-resolution scanning infrared (IR) radiometer for nighttime and daytime imaging of the Earth and clouds, and an array of narrow-angle and wide-angle radiometers for measuring the intensity of radiation reflected from the clouds and oceans, the surface temperatures of the Earth and cloud tops, and the total flux of thermal energy from the Earth-atmosphere system into space, respectively. The experiment terminated operations in October 1966.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Instrument <ref name=\"Hendrickx\"/> !! Number of Spectral Bands !!

The instrumentation consisted of two identical vidicon cameras that were mounted in the satellite base and were directed toward the Earth. Each camera viewed a 500 by 500 km area \u2014 one to the left and the other to the right of nadir \u2014 with a resolution of {{convert|1.25|km}} at nadir from a satellite altitude of {{convert|600|km}} to {{convert|700|km}}. The cameras took a one-frame image of the Earth's cloud cover with slight overlapping of successive frames to provide continuous coverage. The cameras switched on automatically any time the sun was more than 5\u00b0 above the horizon. Because the Earth illumination varied so much, automatic sensors adjusted the camera apertures to produce high-quality pictures under a variety of illumination conditions. The image formed by each vidicon tube either was transmitted directly to the ground if the satellite was in radio contact with one of two ground stations or was recorded on magnetic tape for later transmission if the satellite was beyond the zone of radio communication.<ref name=\"Experiment1\">{{cite web|title=Cosmos 122: Experiment 1966-057A-01 |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1966-057A-01|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|date=27 February 2020|accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe TV images received by these ground stations were processed and transmitted to the Hydrometeorological Center in Moscow, where they were analyzed and used in various forecast and analysis products. The pictures were archived at the Hydrometeorological Center. The Kosmos 122 cameras, although having 2.5 times the resolution of those carried on the ESSA satellites, could not provide continuous overlapping global coverage as do the ESSA cameras owing to the lower orbit of the Kosmos 122 satellite ({{convert|650|km}} compared to {{convert|1400|km}}). Thus, to close the gaps in coverage, at least two satellites were required in the weather satellite system. In addition, cloud cover mosaics were produced from 10 or more individual cloud cover pictures at the Hydrometeorological Center to provide a more comprehensive view of global weather systems.<ref name=\"Experiment1\"/>\n\nSome of the individual pictures and the cloud mosaics were transmitted to various foreign meteorological centers as part of an international meteorological data exchange program. The United States received some of these pictures at the National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS) in Suitland, Maryland, via the \"cold line\" facsimile link with Moscow. Pictures were transmitted to NESS from September 11, 1966, through October 26, 1966. These pictures were archived at NESS for 1 yr and then, unless of unusual interest, were discarded.<ref name=\"Experiment1\"/>\n\n===Scanning high-resolution infrared radiometer===\n\nThe Kosmos 122 high-resolution scanning [[infrared]] (IR) radiometer was designed to make measurements of cloud distribution and snow and ice cover on the dayside and nightside of the earth. The radiometer measured the outgoing radiation from the Earth-atmosphere system in the 8 to 12-\u00b5m atmospheric window. Measurements made in this spectral region permitted the construction of brightness patterns of the thermal relief and determination of equivalent radiation temperatures of the earth's surface and cloud tops. The instrument was a narrow-angle scanning radiometer with an instantaneous viewing angle of 1.5 x 1.5\u00b0. It was mounted in the base of the satellite in a sealed instrument compartment with its optical axis directed along the local vertical and toward nadir. The radiometer measured the intensity of the outgoing radiation by comparing the Earth's radiation flux with the radiation flux from space. Each type of radiation entered the radiometer through separate windows, which were oriented in mutually perpendicular directions. The radiation from the Earth-atmosphere system fell on a plane scanning mirror that was mounted at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the satellite velocity vector and scanned through an angle of plus or minus 50\u00b0 from nadir.<ref name=\"Experiment2\">{{cite web|title=Cosmos 122: Experiment 1966-057A-02|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1966-057A-02 |website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|date=27 February 2020|accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe radiation was reflected from the scanning mirror through a stationary modulating disk and filter window onto a parabolic mirror that focused the parallel beam through a movable modulating disk onto a thermistor bolometer. The stationary and movable modulating disks provided the channel switching, sending first the Earth-atmosphere radiation and then the space radiation to the parabolic mirror and finally to the bolometer. The bolometer converted the radiant flux into variable electric voltages (0 to 6 V) whose frequency was equal to the modulator frequency and whose magnitudes were proportional to the differences in the radiant flux intensities between Earth and space developed at the bolometer output. During the movement of the scanning mirror through a plus or minus 40\u00b0 sector, line scanning (40 lines/min) of the target area was accomplished in a plane normal to the orbital plane using a forward and back path, while scanning along the flight path was provided by the relative motion of the satellite with respect to the earth. In each scan, with the indicated viewing and scanning angles from the satellite's orbital altitude, the radiometer recorded the mean radiation intensities from a band about {{convert|1100|km}} wide with a resolution of about {{convert|15|km}} at nadir to about {{convert|24|km}} to {{convert|27|km}} at the edges. The radiometer was capable of measuring radiation temperatures within 2 to 3\u00b0 for temperatures above 273 K and within 7 to 8\u00b0 for temperatures below 273 K.<ref name=\"Experiment2\"/>\n\nThe video signals were amplified and sent either to the satellite memory unit for later transmission or to the radiotelemetry unit for direct transmission to Earth, depending on whether the satellite was beyond or within the zone of radio communication with a ground receiving station, respectively. The ground receivers recorded the transmitted data in digital form on magnetic tape and simultaneously on 80-mm photographic film in the form of a brightness image of the thermal relief of the Earth-atmosphere system. The data on magnetic tape were processed by computer at the Soviet Hydrometeorological Center and were used to produce a digital map of the equivalent radiation temperature field with a superposed geographic grid. The photographic film was developed and processed into an IR picture also with a superposed grid. The pictures were archived at the Hydrometeorological Center. Some of these pictures were transmitted to various foreign meteorological centers as part of an international meteorological data exchange program. The United States received these pictures at the National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS), Suitland, Maryland, via the \"cold line\" facsimile link with Moscow. Pictures were transmitted to NESS from mid-September until late October 1966. These IR pictures were kept at NESS for 1 yr and then, unless of unusual interest, were discarded.<ref name=\"Experiment2\"/>\n\n===Actinometric instrument===\n\nThe Kosmos 122 actinometric experiment was designed to measure the outgoing longwave [[radiation]] (3 to 30 \u00b5m) from the Earth-atmosphere system, the outgoing near [[ultraviolet]] (UV), visible, and near-[[infrared]] (IR) solar radiation (0.3 to 3 \u00b5m) reflected and backscattered by the Earth-atmosphere system, and the effective radiation temperature of the Earth's surface and cloud tops (8 to 12 \u00b5m).<ref name=\"Experiment3\">{{cite web|title=Cosmos 122: Experiment 1966-057A-03|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1966-057A-03|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA|date=27 February 2020|accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe instrumentation consisted of four radiometers: a pair of scanning, narrow-angle, two-channel [[radiometers]] and a pair of nonscanning, wide-angle, two-channel radiometers. The narrow-angle (4 by 5\u00b0 field of view (FOV)) radiometers measured radiation in all three spectral bands, while the wide-angle (136 to 140\u00b0 FOV) radiometers operated only in the 0.3 to 3-\u00b5m and 3 to 30-\u00b5m bands. In the narrow-angle radiometer, the 0.3 to 3-\u00b5m band was measured in one channel and the 8 to 12-\u00b5m and 3 to 30-\u00b5m bands were combined in the second channel. In the second channel, the two bands were separated by the exchange of corresponding filters as the radiometer scanned in alternate directions.<ref name=\"Experiment3\"/>\n\nThe Earth radiation entered the narrow-angle radiometer through a cylindrical fairing (KRS-5 crystal) and fell onto a conical scanning mirror. The radiation was reflected from the mirror through a three-lobed rotating mirror chopper that modulated the radiation flux at a frequency of 80 Hz. The chopper alternately reflected Earth radiation and space radiation, which entered through a separate KRS-5 crystal window, onto one of three openings in a color filter wheel -- one filter for each spectral band. The particular spectral band that was passed through then fell on an off-axis parabolic mirror that focused the radiation flux onto a bolometric receiver. Periodic calibration was made when the scanning mirror moved to a 90\u00b0 angle from nadir with simultaneous turning on and viewing of a [[silicon]] standard lamp.<ref name=\"Experiment3\"/>\n\nThe 0.3 to 3-\u00b5m channel did not use the two-beam system or filter switching. The output from the modulated flow of radiation on the bolometer was amplified, rectified, filtered, and fed into the radio-telemetry system over eight channels. The wide-angle radiometers had identical optical systems for both channels. The Earth radiation entered the radiometer through a hemispherical shell composed of quartz or KRS-5 crystal with a coating that determined the passband. The radiation was then modulated with a frequency of 64 Hz and fell on a bolometric receiver. As in the narrow-angle radiometers, the bolometer output was processed and fed into the radio-telemetry system. The wide-angle radiometer was standardized simultaneously with the narrow-angle radiometers by the input of a standard 64 Hz calibrating frequency into the amplification circuit.<ref name=\"Experiment3\"/>\n\nThe relative RMS measuring error for both types of radiometers was about 0.5%. To provide a backup capability, one wide-angle and one narrow-angle radiometer were held in reserve and could have been activated on command from the ground. The orientation of the Kosmos 122 satellite insured that the primary optical axes of the radiometers were oriented vertically downward toward nadir. The survey of the Earth's surface by both radiometers was carried out by the motion of the satellite relative to the Earth. In addition, the narrow-angle radiometer scanned 66\u00b0 to either side of nadir in a plane normal to the orbital plane by rocking the scanning mirror about the optical axis. The radiometers covered a strip about 2500 km wide on the Earth's surface and had a ground resolution of 50 km at nadir.<ref name=\"Experiment3\"/>\n\nThe data were reduced at the ground stations and were transmitted in binary form to the Hydrometeorological Center in Moscow, where they were recorded in digital form on magnetic tape and were used to produce various analysis products such as Earth-atmosphere albedo charts and radiation temperature maps. The data were archived at the Hydrometeorological Center. Some of these charts were transmitted in graphical form to various foreign meteorological centers, including the National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS), Suitland, Maryland. These actinometric charts were received at NESS via the \"cold line\" facsimile link with Moscow from mid-August 1966 until late October 1966.

It was created on the Unity engine by [[AlternativaPlatform]], a Russia-based game developing company. The game uses the [[free-to-play]] business model, where players can download and play the game for free. However, players can also pay real world money in the form of [[Micro-transactions|micro transactions]] to get \"X Crystals\". These X Crystals unlock special cosmetic features for tanks and blueprint containers which can unlock and upgrade modules.

The number of experience gained is based on various factors including the number of opponents destroyed, killstreak and the amount of XP earned throughout the match. The amount of XP players gain has its own set of rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game.\n\nPlayers can also buy X Crystals. X Crystals are a premium currency, which is bought with real world money, and unlocks special skins, graffiti, special shell colors for turret ammo, paints for tanks and containers for module blueprints. X crystals can also be earned by completing missions and entering certain promo codes.\n\n=== Ranked Battles ===\nThe ranked battle system is a ranking ladder which organizes players using RP (reputation points), which are rewarded or lost at the end of a completed battle. These points place players within a certain league, depending on how much RP they have. From lowest to highest, there are 5 leagues: Training, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Masters. Upon entering a league for the first time, the game will grant players with the paint and 5 containers for the corresponding league. Every 2 months, the league system enters a new season. At that time, the game will award players with crystals, x crystals, and league containers for the league they ended the season in. The game also reduces each player's RP by a certain amount, depending on where they are at.\n\n==Reception==\n\nOn September 15, 2016, Tanki X began its Open Beta test.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.forum.tankix.com/forums/topic/1176-open-beta-testing-still-a-testing-environment/?tab=comments#comment-13280 |title=Open Beta Testing - still a testing environment|date=2016-09-15}}</ref>\n\nOn April 13, 2017, Alternativa Platform announced their plans to release Tanki X on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mmos.com/news/tanki-x-go-live-steam-early-access-april-20tjh|title=Tanki X To Go Live On Steam Early Access On April 20th - MMOs.com|date=2017-04-13|work=MMOs.com|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-US}}</ref> As promised, Tanki X was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/607200/Tanki_X/|title=Tanki X on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|accessdate=2017-05-20}}</ref>\n\nOn March 13, 2018, Tanki X left the Open Beta Testing stage and was officially released with the Arms Race update.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tankix.com/en/news/tanki-x-officially-released/ |title=Tanki X has been officially released! |last= |first= |date=13 March 2018 |website=tankix.com |publisher=Tanki Online Europe Ltd. |access-date=14 March 2018 |quote=Today, '''March 13th, 2018''', becomes the official release date of Tanki X.

It was created on the Unity engine by [[AlternativaPlatform]], a Russia-based game developing company. The game uses the [[free-to-play]] business model, where players can download and play the game for free. However, players can also pay real world money in the form of [[Micro-transactions|micro transactions]] to get \"X Crystals\". These X Crystals unlock special cosmetic features for tanks and blueprint containers which can unlock and upgrade modules.

At the moment, Tanki X features three game modes: [[Deathmatch]], [[Team deathmatch|Team Deathmatch]], and [[Capture the Flag]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://help.tankix.com/en/tanki-x/articles/basics/Battles|title=Knowledge Base \u2014 Tanki X \u2014 Battle modes|website=help.tankix.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref> Players can create their own tank combination from a selection of different turrets and hulls, all unique in their strengths and weaknesses.    [[File:Tanki X Area159.jpg|thumb|Capture the Flag on Tanki X map \"Area 159\".]]\n\n=== In-game Currency and Ranking System ===\nFor every tank destroyed or flag captured, players build up a number of XP (rank experience points) which they are rewarded, and container points. The number of experience gained is based on various factors including the number of opponents destroyed, killstreak and the amount of XP earned throughout the match. The amount of XP players gain has its own set of rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game.\n\nPlayers can also buy X Crystals. X Crystals are a premium currency, which is bought with real world money, and unlocks special skins, graffiti, special shell colors for turret ammo, paints for tanks and containers for module blueprints. X crystals can also be earned by completing missions and entering certain promo codes.\n\n=== Ranked Battles ===\nThe ranked battle system is a ranking ladder which organizes players using RP (reputation points), which are rewarded or lost at the end of a completed battle. These points place players within a certain league, depending on how much RP they have. From lowest to highest, there are 5 leagues: Training, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Masters. Upon entering a league for the first time, the game will grant players with the paint and 5 containers for the corresponding league. Every 2 months, the league system enters a new season. At that time, the game will award players with crystals, x crystals, and league containers for the league they ended the season in. The game also reduces each player's RP by a certain amount, depending on where they are at.\n\n==Reception==\n\nOn September 15, 2016, Tanki X began its Open Beta test.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.forum.tankix.com/forums/topic/1176-open-beta-testing-still-a-testing-environment/?tab=comments#comment-13280 |title=Open Beta Testing - still a testing environment|date=2016-09-15}}</ref>\n\nOn April 13, 2017, Alternativa Platform announced their plans to release Tanki X on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mmos.com/news/tanki-x-go-live-steam-early-access-april-20tjh|title=Tanki X To Go Live On Steam Early Access On April 20th - MMOs.com|date=2017-04-13|work=MMOs.com|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-US}}</ref> As promised, Tanki X was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/607200/Tanki_X/|title=Tanki X on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|accessdate=2017-05-20}}</ref>\n\nOn March 13, 2018, Tanki X left the Open Beta Testing stage and was officially released with the Arms Race update.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tankix.com/en/news/tanki-x-officially-released/ |title=Tanki X has been officially released! |last= |first= |date=13 March 2018 |website=tankix.com |publisher=Tanki Online Europe Ltd. |access-date=14 March 2018 |quote=Today, '''March 13th, 2018''', becomes the official release date of Tanki X.

During two combat tours, he shot down nine enemy aircraft to become a [[flying ace]].\n\nHe was an early member of the [[Blue Angels]] flight demonstration squadron and flew the lead \"solo\" position. His work as a [[test pilot]] included aircraft, electronic systems, and operational tactics such as developing techniques for delivering nuclear weapons from small fighter aircraft. He commanded increasingly larger air units including [[VFA-11|VF-11]] and Carrier Air Group Ten as well as training organizations that helped the Navy transition from propeller to jet aircraft. He commanded two Navy ships, served as the head of Navy Fighter Design, and was a key contributor to fighter studies that resulted in the development of jet aircraft that {{as of|2015|lc=y}} are still in active service.\n\nFeightner was the only pilot to land the dash-1 variant of the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]] aboard a carrier. He led VF-11 to become the first Atlantic fleet unit in which every pilot received the coveted \"E\" award in a single exercise. After retiring from the Navy, Feightner promoted aviation and shared his experiences with others.\n\n==Early life==\nFeightner was born on October 14, 1919 in [[Lima, Ohio]], a small town in the northwest part of the state, to Amos and Mary Feightner.{{sfnp|Wooldridge|1993|p=78}} He attended [[Findlay College]] in Findlay, Ohio{{sfnp|Astor|2005|p=3}} and learned to fly in the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP).

Feightner also tested the [[Grumman F8F Bearcat]], the [[Vought F4U Corsair]], and the [[Grumman F7F Tigercat]].<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p12>{{cite book |last = Eanett |year=2005 |title=Interview Transcript |page=12}}</ref> When Colonel [[Charles Lindbergh]] came to evaluate the Tigercat, Feightner, as F7F project pilot, provided the pre-flight instruction.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_pp_14_15>{{cite book |last = Eanett |year=2005 |title=Interview Transcript |pages=14&ndash;15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:F7U-1 CVB-41 landing 1951.jpg|left|thumb|Feightner landing F7U-1, No. 415, on the USS Midway in 1951]]\nFeightner was assigned as the Navy's project pilot for the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]], a carrier-based jet [[fighter-bomber]] with [[swept wing]]s and an unusual [[Tailless aircraft|tailless]] design.{{sfnp|Powell|2008|p=37}} From July 23 to August 14, 1951, he performed carrier suitability tests of the Cutlass on board the {{USS|Midway|CV-41|6}}.{{sfnp|Gardner|2010|p=72}} Feightner survived a number of near-fatal incidents in the Cutlass. During a test using the NAS Patuxent River air field catapult, an engine exploded and caught fire on takeoff. Unable to eject at such a low altitude, Feightner made use of a low spot in the river bank to turn the aircraft and return safely to the field where firefighters extinguished the burning engine.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=82}} On July 23, 1951, he performed the first (and only) carrier takeoff and landing of the dash-1 variant on the aircraft carrier USS ''Midway''.{{sfnp|Powell|2008|p=37}} Landing the Cutlass was hazardous due to the extreme nose-up attitude that restricted visibility forward and below. Feightner was unable to see the flight deck and relied on the [[Landing Signal Officer]] (LSO) to provide the indication to reduce engine power. Despite assistance from the LSO, Feightner landed short of the desired position and nearly [[ramp strike|struck the ramp]].{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=83}} Although the fleet received the improved F7U-3, the Cutlass did not live up to its potential and remained in service less than four years.{{sfnp|Grossnick|1995|p=481}}\n\n===Blue Angels===\nIn January 1952, Feightner received orders to the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration squadron&mdash;the Blue Angels. The squadron had been directed to add the Cutlass to their performance although neither Feightner nor Blue Angels commander [[Roy Marlin Voris|\"Butch\" Voris]] believed the aircraft was ready for formation flying.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}} The F7U was the Navy's first operational aircraft fitted with a hydraulic [[flight control system]] and reliability was still poor.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=46}} In the event of failure, the mechanical backup system required eleven seconds before control was restored.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=47}} The solution was to fly the F7Us separately from the rest of the team thereby creating the diamond and solo roles that remain to the present day. Feightner recruited former Blue Angel Lt. Harding C. \"Mac\" Macknight to fly the second Cutlass.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}}\n\n[[File:F7U-1 Blue Angels 1952.jpg|right|thumb|Blue Angels F7U-1 Cutlass in 1952]]\nAt the start of the 1952 show season, fuel control problems grounded the team's [[Grumman F9F Panther]]s leaving the Cutlasses to put on the primary demonstration between March and June.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=50}} During a show at [[Saufley Field]] in Florida, Feightner experienced a total loss of hydraulics on a full afterburner takeoff and steep climb. While trying to gain enough altitude for ejection he was able to stay with the aircraft until the back up control system engaged. He clipped trees on the end of the runway, causing the left engine to flame out. With hydraulic fluid streaming back in a bright flame, he made a hard turn and got the plane back on the runway, much to the excitement of the crowd.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=49}} Feightner and Macknight performed maneuvers that showed off the best attributes of the F7U. The two solos would approach each other from opposite ends of the runway and, after passing each other, would roll the aircraft, deploy [[Air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]], and light [[afterburner]]s. In Feightner's opinion, \"There just is not an airplane like it anywhere.\"{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=51}}\n\nMaintenance issues and additional near-fatal accidents put an end to Blue Angel Cutlass performances.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=52}} While traveling to an airshow at [[Naval Air Station Glenview]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], both F7Us experienced in-flight emergencies. One of Feightner's engines failed shortly after takeoff, but before he could land, Macknight's right engine caught fire and the left engine quit soon after. Although Feightner called for him to eject, Macknight stayed with the burning aircraft and landed at Glenview.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=53}} With the runway closed, Feightner was redirected to make his landing at Chicago's former Orchard Airpark, which had been expanded and renamed [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]] after Feightner's former VF-3 commander. The runway had just been completed and was covered with peach baskets to prevent aircraft from landing until it was opened. Feightner was told to ignore the baskets and land on the new runway. As a result, Feightner's F7U became the first aircraft to land on the new runway for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=86}} After yet another in-flight emergency resulted in a forced landing at [[Naval Air Station Memphis]], the F7Us were given to the station's training center.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=56}}\n\n===Return to testing===\nIn September 1952, Feightner returned to flight test as the development officer for Air Development Squadron Three ([[VX-3 (Squadron)|VX-3]]).<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6/> VX-3 was located at [[Atlantic City Air National Guard Base|NAS Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], and was responsible for testing fighter aircraft, systems, and munitions.{{sfnp|Lurie|2004|p=48}} In this new role, he tested aircraft systems (rather than the airplanes themselves) and determined what tactics would most effectively utilize those systems.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6>{{cite book |last = Eanett |title=Interview Transcript |year=2005 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nOn December 3, 1953, Feightner participated in the first public demonstration of the [[Aircraft catapult#Steam catapult|steam catapult]] chosen  to launch heavy jet aircraft from the short decks of aircraft carriers. Flying a propeller-driven [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|AD Skyraider]] at the [[Naval Air Material Center]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], Feightner described the steam-powered launch as \"much better for the pilot\" due to the relatively gentle start that eliminated the shock of other catapult techniques.<ref name=NAN_Feb_54>{{cite journal |last= |first=|date=February 1954 |title=From David to Brown |journal=Naval Aviation News |volume= |issue= |pages=1&ndash;2 |publisher=United States Navy |location=Washington, D.C. |doi= |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1954/feb54.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201231458/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1954/feb54.pdf |archivedate=December 1, 2014 |accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFeightner contributed to the development of weapon delivery tactics for the [[McDonnell F2H Banshee]].{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=98}} The F2H-2B was modified for the attack role and had strengthened wings and pylons to accommodate a heavy weapon such as the  [[Mark 7 nuclear bomb|Mark 7]] or [[Mark 8 nuclear bomb]].{{sfnp|Francillon|1990|p=81}} The F2H-2B testing on which Feightner worked included the longest non-stop, round trip flight from a carrier&mdash;more than 2,800 miles.

During two combat tours, he shot down nine enemy aircraft to become a [[flying ace]].\n\nHe was an early member of the [[Blue Angels]] flight demonstration squadron and flew the lead \"solo\" position. His work as a [[test pilot]] included aircraft, electronic systems, and operational tactics such as developing techniques for delivering nuclear weapons from small fighter aircraft. He commanded increasingly larger air units including [[VFA-11|VF-11]] and Carrier Air Group Ten as well as training organizations that helped the Navy transition from propeller to jet aircraft. He commanded two Navy ships, served as the head of Navy Fighter Design, and was a key contributor to fighter studies that resulted in the development of jet aircraft that {{as of|2015|lc=y}} are still in active service.\n\nFeightner was the only pilot to land the dash-1 variant of the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]] aboard a carrier. He led VF-11 to become the first Atlantic fleet unit in which every pilot received the coveted \"E\" award in a single exercise. After retiring from the Navy, Feightner promoted aviation and shared his experiences with others.\n\n==Early life==\nFeightner was born on October 14, 1919 in [[Lima, Ohio]], a small town in the northwest part of the state, to Amos and Mary Feightner.{{sfnp|Wooldridge|1993|p=78}} He attended [[Findlay College]] in Findlay, Ohio{{sfnp|Astor|2005|p=3}} and learned to fly in the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP). The CPTP was a flight training program sponsored by the United States government to increase the number of civilian pilots and thereby create a pool of trained aviators from which the military could draw.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p2>{{cite book |last = Eanett |year=2005 |title=Interview Transcript |page=2}}</ref> By 1940, Feightner received his [[private pilot license]].{{sfnp|Astor|2005|p=3}} He graduated from Findlay College in 1941.{{sfnp|Wooldridge|1993|p=78}}\n\n==World War II service==\nWith war approaching and because of his strong desire to fly, Feightner attempted to sign up with the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. But he faced an eight-month delay before acceptance since the Army flight program could not cope with the large influx of people. When Feightner found that the Navy would accept him immediately, he made up his mind to pursue naval aviation.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p3>{{cite book |last = Eanett |year=2005 |title=Interview Transcript |page=3}}</ref> On June 16, 1941, Feightner enlisted in the [[United States Navy Reserve]] and entered the [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USN)|Naval Aviation Cadet Training Program]].

Feightner was unable to see the flight deck and relied on the [[Landing Signal Officer]] (LSO) to provide the indication to reduce engine power. Despite assistance from the LSO, Feightner landed short of the desired position and nearly [[ramp strike|struck the ramp]].{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=83}} Although the fleet received the improved F7U-3, the Cutlass did not live up to its potential and remained in service less than four years.{{sfnp|Grossnick|1995|p=481}}\n\n===Blue Angels===\nIn January 1952, Feightner received orders to the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration squadron&mdash;the Blue Angels. The squadron had been directed to add the Cutlass to their performance although neither Feightner nor Blue Angels commander [[Roy Marlin Voris|\"Butch\" Voris]] believed the aircraft was ready for formation flying.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}} The F7U was the Navy's first operational aircraft fitted with a hydraulic [[flight control system]] and reliability was still poor.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=46}} In the event of failure, the mechanical backup system required eleven seconds before control was restored.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=47}} The solution was to fly the F7Us separately from the rest of the team thereby creating the diamond and solo roles that remain to the present day. Feightner recruited former Blue Angel Lt. Harding C. \"Mac\" Macknight to fly the second Cutlass.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}}\n\n[[File:F7U-1 Blue Angels 1952.jpg|right|thumb|Blue Angels F7U-1 Cutlass in 1952]]\nAt the start of the 1952 show season, fuel control problems grounded the team's [[Grumman F9F Panther]]s leaving the Cutlasses to put on the primary demonstration between March and June.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=50}} During a show at [[Saufley Field]] in Florida, Feightner experienced a total loss of hydraulics on a full afterburner takeoff and steep climb. While trying to gain enough altitude for ejection he was able to stay with the aircraft until the back up control system engaged. He clipped trees on the end of the runway, causing the left engine to flame out. With hydraulic fluid streaming back in a bright flame, he made a hard turn and got the plane back on the runway, much to the excitement of the crowd.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=49}} Feightner and Macknight performed maneuvers that showed off the best attributes of the F7U. The two solos would approach each other from opposite ends of the runway and, after passing each other, would roll the aircraft, deploy [[Air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]], and light [[afterburner]]s. In Feightner's opinion, \"There just is not an airplane like it anywhere.\"{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=51}}\n\nMaintenance issues and additional near-fatal accidents put an end to Blue Angel Cutlass performances.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=52}} While traveling to an airshow at [[Naval Air Station Glenview]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], both F7Us experienced in-flight emergencies. One of Feightner's engines failed shortly after takeoff, but before he could land, Macknight's right engine caught fire and the left engine quit soon after. Although Feightner called for him to eject, Macknight stayed with the burning aircraft and landed at Glenview.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=53}} With the runway closed, Feightner was redirected to make his landing at Chicago's former Orchard Airpark, which had been expanded and renamed [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]] after Feightner's former VF-3 commander. The runway had just been completed and was covered with peach baskets to prevent aircraft from landing until it was opened. Feightner was told to ignore the baskets and land on the new runway. As a result, Feightner's F7U became the first aircraft to land on the new runway for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=86}} After yet another in-flight emergency resulted in a forced landing at [[Naval Air Station Memphis]], the F7Us were given to the station's training center.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=56}}\n\n===Return to testing===\nIn September 1952, Feightner returned to flight test as the development officer for Air Development Squadron Three ([[VX-3 (Squadron)|VX-3]]).<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6/> VX-3 was located at [[Atlantic City Air National Guard Base|NAS Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], and was responsible for testing fighter aircraft, systems, and munitions.{{sfnp|Lurie|2004|p=48}} In this new role, he tested aircraft systems (rather than the airplanes themselves) and determined what tactics would most effectively utilize those systems.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6>{{cite book |last = Eanett |title=Interview Transcript |year=2005 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nOn December 3, 1953, Feightner participated in the first public demonstration of the [[Aircraft catapult#Steam catapult|steam catapult]] chosen  to launch heavy jet aircraft from the short decks of aircraft carriers.
