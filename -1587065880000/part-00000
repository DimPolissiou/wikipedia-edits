He enjoyed photography and baseball; he was a [[first baseman]] during his first year of high school until a hand injury forced him to stop playing, and later [[Manager (baseball)|managed]] the team. Following his high school graduation, Spellman entered [[Fordham University]] in [[New York City]] in 1907. He graduated in 1911 and decided to study for the priesthood.

Though an early supporter of Roosevelt, Coughlin became increasingly disenchanted with him and made increasingly sharp national radio attacks on Roosevelt and the New Deal. He also expressed sympathy for the governments of Hitler and Mussolini as opponents of Communism. The Catholic hierarchy for its part did not like Coughlin.

He sent priests overseas to study Spanish, and by 1960 a quarter of all the archdiocese's parishes had an outreach to Spanish-speaking Catholics.<ref name=McNamara/> In his years as a cardinal Spellman built 15 churches, 94 schools, 22 rectories, 60 convents, and 34 other institutions.<ref name=\"Shannon_NYT\" /> He also visited [[Ecuador]], where he founded three schools: Cardinal Spellman High School and Cardinal Spellman Girls' School, both in [[Quito]]; and Cardinal Spellman High School in [[Guayaquil]]. All of these schools are still currently open.\n\n====Second Vatican Council====\nSpellman attended the [[Second Vatican Council]] from 1962 to 1965, and sat on its Board of Presidency.<ref name=cardinals/>  The Cardinal believed that predominantly [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] clergymen were being appointed to the Council's commissions, and opposed the introduction of [[vernacular]] into the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], saying, \"The [[Latin]] language, which is truly the Catholic language, is unchangeable, is not vulgar, and has for many centuries been the guardian of the unity of the [[Latin Rite|Western Church]].\"<ref name=cooney/> A theological conservative, he supported ecumenism on pragmatic grounds.<ref name=Shaw/> However, in April 1963 Spellman brought to the Second Vatican Council [[John Courtney Murray]] as a ''peritus'' (expert) despite Cardinal Ottaviani\u2019s well-known animosity towards him. With Apostolic Delegate to the U.S. Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi attempting to silence Murray, Spellman, along with Murray's Jesuit superiors, continued to shield him from most attempts at Curial interference. Murray's work helped shape the council's declaration on religious freedom.<ref name=McNamara/>\n\n====Growing revolution====\nSpellman, following the death of John XXIII, [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclave, 1963|participated]] in the [[Papal conclave, 1963|conclave of 1963]], which resulted in the election of  [[Pope Paul VI]]. When ''[[The Deputy]]'', a controversial play about Pius XII's actions during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1964, Spellman condemned the play as \"an outrageous desecration of the honor of a great and good man\".<ref>DeMarco 1998</ref> The play's producer, [[Herman Shumlin]], responded by calling Spellman's words a \"calculated threat to really drive a wedge between Christians and Jews\".<ref name=cooney/>\n\nAlthough he once expressed his personal opposition to demonstrations during the [[Civil Rights Movement]],<ref name=cooney/> Spellman declined [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s requests to condemn [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and funded the trip of a group of New York priests and [[Religious Sister]]s to the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. He opposed [[Racism|racial discrimination]] in [[public housing]]<ref name=echo/> but also the social activism of such priests as [[Daniel Berrigan]] and his brother, [[Philip Berrigan]], as well as a young [[Melkite]] priest, [[David Kirk (activist)|David Kirk]].<ref name=cooney/>\n\n====Lyndon Johnson and Vietnam====\nDuring the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], Spellman supported [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], whose [[Higher Education Act of 1965|Higher Education Facilities Act]] and [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964|Economic Opportunity Act]] had greatly benefited the Church.<ref name=cooney/> The Cardinal later agreed to Johnson's requests to send priests to the [[Dominican Republic]] to defuse [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] sentiments following the [[United States invasion of the Dominican Republic|invasion of 1965]].<ref name=cooney/>\n\nSpellman was an outspoken supporter of the [[Vietnam War]], to the extent that the conflict became known as \"Spelly's War\" and the Cardinal as the \"[[Bob Hope]] of the clergy\".<ref name=cooney/> He met [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] in 1950 and, favorably impressed by his strongly Catholic and anti-Communist views, promoted his career; however, he disassociated from Diem before the latter's [[Arrest and assassination of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m|assassination in 1963]].<ref name=cooney/> Fearful of [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Communist gains in Vietnam]], Spellman had urged American intervention since late 1954,<ref name=cooney/> but by the 1960s his views were strongly criticized by antiwar activists and even his fellow religious leaders.<ref name=\"GPB\">{{cite web | url=https://excatholicsforchrist.com/cardinal-francis-spellman/ | title=Cardinal Francis Spellman: \"The American Pope\" | publisher=Ex-Catholics For Christ | date=March 29, 2006 | accessdate=May 26, 2019 | author=GPB | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525221257/https://excatholicsforchrist.com/cardinal-francis-spellman/ | archivedate=May 25, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen Pope Paul VI visited the United States in October 1965, he indirectly rebuked Spellman's hawkish stance by pleading for peace before the [[United Nations]]. A group of college students protested outside his residence in December 1965 for suppressing antiwar priests, and he later spent that year's Christmas with troops in [[South Vietnam]].<ref name=cooney/> While in Vietnam, Spellman quoted [[Stephen Decatur]] in declaring, \"My country, may it always be right, but right or wrong, my country\".<ref name=McNamara/> He also described Vietnam as a \"war for civilization\" and \"[[Jesus|Christ]]'s war against the [[Vietcong]] and the people of [[North Vietnam]]\".<ref name=cooney/> One priest accused Spellman of \"[blessing] the guns which the pope is begging us to put down\".<ref name=echo>O'Donnell 2009</ref> In January 1967, antiwar protestors disrupted a Mass at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]].<ref name=McNamara/> His support for the Vietnam War, along with his opposition to church reform, greatly undermined Spellman's clout within the church and country.<ref name=cooney/>\n\nSpellman was awarded the [[Sylvanus Thayer Award]] by the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], in 1967. Illustrator [[Edward Sorel]] designed a poster in 1967 titled ''Pass the Lord and Praise the Ammunition'', showing Spellman carrying a rifle with bayonet, but the poster was never distributed because Spellman died right after it was printed.<ref>[[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] Website, annotated image of the poster</ref>\n\n====Later life and death====\nIn 1966, Spellman offered his resignation to Pope Paul VI after the latter instituted a policy whereby bishops retire at age 75, but Paul VI asked him to remain in his post.<ref name=resignation>{{cite news|date=October 21, 1966|work=[[TIME Magazine]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836510-2,00.html | title=People: Oct. 21, 1966 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> He led his archdiocese through an extensive period of building the Catholic infrastructure, particularly the construction of numerous churches, schools, and hospitals. He consolidated all parish building programs into his own hands, thereby getting better interest rates from bankers, and convinced Pius XII of the need to internationalize the Vatican's Italy-centered investments after World War II; for his financial skill, he was sometimes called \"Cardinal Moneybags\".<ref name=pastor>{{cite news|date=May 15, 1964|work=[[TIME Magazine]]|title=The Pastor-Executive|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871039,00.html}}</ref>\n\nSpellman died in New York City on December 2, 1967, at age 78, and was interred in the crypt under the main altar at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]].

Before publication, he circulated [[galley proof]]s of the book, which included several pages arguing that Spellman had been a homosexual, based on multiple anonymous sources.<ref name=\"Shannon_NYT\" />  This draft of the book was covered in the press.  However, the final published version removed this material, replacing it with two sentences:  \"For years rumors abounded about Cardinal Spellman being a homosexual.  As a result many felt \u2013 and continue to feel \u2013 that Spellman the public moralist may well have been a contradiction of the man of the flesh.\"<ref name=\"Shannon_NYT\" />\n\nJournalist [[Michelangelo Signorile]] describes Spellman as \"one of the most notorious, powerful and sexually voracious homosexuals in the American Catholic Church's history.\"<ref name=\"Signorile\">{{cite news |author=Michelangelo Signorile |title=Cardinal Spellman's Dark Legacy |date=May 7, 2002 |newspaper=[[New York Press]] |url=http://nypress.com/cardinal-spellmans-dark-legacy/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731053540/http://www.nypress.com/cardinal-spellmans-dark-legacy/ |archivedate=July 31, 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  Signorile reported that Cooney's manuscript initially contained interviews with several people with personal knowledge of Spellman's homosexuality, including researcher and historian [[C.

According to Signorile, the Catholic Church pressured Cooney's publisher, [[Times Books]], to reduce the four pages discussing Spellman's sexuality to a single paragraph.<ref name=\"Signorile\" />  Both Signorile and John Loughery cite a story suggesting that Spellman was sexually active and carrying on a relationship with a male member of the chorus in the Broadway revue ''[[One Touch of Venus]]''.<ref name=\"Signorile\" /><ref>{{cite book |author=John Loughery |title=The Other Side of Silence: Men's Lives & Gay Identities \u2013 A Twentieth-Century History |url=https://archive.org/details/othersideofsile000loug |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Henry Holt & Co. |year=1998 |page=[https://archive.org/details/othersideofsile000loug/page/152 152]}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, [[Curt Gentry]], biographer of [[J.

He enjoyed photography and baseball; he was a [[first baseman]] during his first year of high school until a hand injury forced him to stop playing, and later [[Manager (baseball)|managed]] the team. Following his high school graduation, Spellman entered [[Fordham University]] in [[New York City]] in 1907. He graduated in 1911 and decided to study for the priesthood.

Though an early supporter of Roosevelt, Coughlin became increasingly disenchanted with him and made increasingly sharp national radio attacks on Roosevelt and the New Deal. He also expressed sympathy for the governments of Hitler and Mussolini as opponents of Communism. The Catholic hierarchy for its part did not like Coughlin.

Kennedy|Robert]] and [[Ted Kennedy]].\n\nHistorian Pat McNamara views Spellman's outreach to the city's growing [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] community as years ahead of its time. He sent priests overseas to study Spanish, and by 1960 a quarter of all the archdiocese's parishes had an outreach to Spanish-speaking Catholics.<ref name=McNamara/> In his years as a cardinal Spellman built 15 churches, 94 schools, 22 rectories, 60 convents, and 34 other institutions.<ref name=\"Shannon_NYT\" /> He also visited [[Ecuador]], where he founded three schools: Cardinal Spellman High School and Cardinal Spellman Girls' School, both in [[Quito]]; and Cardinal Spellman High School in [[Guayaquil]]. All of these schools are still currently open.\n\n====Second Vatican Council====\nSpellman attended the [[Second Vatican Council]] from 1962 to 1965, and sat on its Board of Presidency.<ref name=cardinals/>  The Cardinal believed that predominantly [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] clergymen were being appointed to the Council's commissions, and opposed the introduction of [[vernacular]] into the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], saying, \"The [[Latin]] language, which is truly the Catholic language, is unchangeable, is not vulgar, and has for many centuries been the guardian of the unity of the [[Latin Rite|Western Church]].\"<ref name=cooney/> A theological conservative, he supported ecumenism on pragmatic grounds.<ref name=Shaw/> However, in April 1963 Spellman brought to the Second Vatican Council [[John Courtney Murray]] as a ''peritus'' (expert) despite Cardinal Ottaviani\u2019s well-known animosity towards him. With Apostolic Delegate to the U.S. Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi attempting to silence Murray, Spellman, along with Murray's Jesuit superiors, continued to shield him from most attempts at Curial interference. Murray's work helped shape the council's declaration on religious freedom.<ref name=McNamara/>\n\n====Growing revolution====\nSpellman, following the death of John XXIII, [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclave, 1963|participated]] in the [[Papal conclave, 1963|conclave of 1963]], which resulted in the election of  [[Pope Paul VI]]. When ''[[The Deputy]]'', a controversial play about Pius XII's actions during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1964, Spellman condemned the play as \"an outrageous desecration of the honor of a great and good man\".<ref>DeMarco 1998</ref> The play's producer, [[Herman Shumlin]], responded by calling Spellman's words a \"calculated threat to really drive a wedge between Christians and Jews\".<ref name=cooney/>\n\nAlthough he once expressed his personal opposition to demonstrations during the [[Civil Rights Movement]],<ref name=cooney/> Spellman declined [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s requests to condemn [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and funded the trip of a group of New York priests and [[Religious Sister]]s to the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. He opposed [[Racism|racial discrimination]] in [[public housing]]<ref name=echo/> but also the social activism of such priests as [[Daniel Berrigan]] and his brother, [[Philip Berrigan]], as well as a young [[Melkite]] priest, [[David Kirk (activist)|David Kirk]].<ref name=cooney/>\n\n====Lyndon Johnson and Vietnam====\nDuring the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], Spellman supported [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], whose [[Higher Education Act of 1965|Higher Education Facilities Act]] and [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964|Economic Opportunity Act]] had greatly benefited the Church.<ref name=cooney/> The Cardinal later agreed to Johnson's requests to send priests to the [[Dominican Republic]] to defuse [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] sentiments following the [[United States invasion of the Dominican Republic|invasion of 1965]].<ref name=cooney/>\n\nSpellman was an outspoken supporter of the [[Vietnam War]], to the extent that the conflict became known as \"Spelly's War\" and the Cardinal as the \"[[Bob Hope]] of the clergy\".<ref name=cooney/> He met [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] in 1950 and, favorably impressed by his strongly Catholic and anti-Communist views, promoted his career; however, he disassociated from Diem before the latter's [[Arrest and assassination of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m|assassination in 1963]].<ref name=cooney/> Fearful of [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Communist gains in Vietnam]], Spellman had urged American intervention since late 1954,<ref name=cooney/> but by the 1960s his views were strongly criticized by antiwar activists and even his fellow religious leaders.<ref name=\"GPB\">{{cite web | url=https://excatholicsforchrist.com/cardinal-francis-spellman/ | title=Cardinal Francis Spellman: \"The American Pope\" | publisher=Ex-Catholics For Christ | date=March 29, 2006 | accessdate=May 26, 2019 | author=GPB | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525221257/https://excatholicsforchrist.com/cardinal-francis-spellman/ | archivedate=May 25, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen Pope Paul VI visited the United States in October 1965, he indirectly rebuked Spellman's hawkish stance by pleading for peace before the [[United Nations]].

The town has a population of {{Formatnum: {{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|Kokkola}}}} ({{#time: j F Y|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|sourcedate}} }})<ref name=\"population_count\" /> and covers an area of {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/total area|Kokkola}}|km2}} of which {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/waters area|Kokkola}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water.<ref name=\"total_area\" /> The population density is {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population density|Kokkola|round=2}}|PD/km2}}. Neighbour municipalities are [[Halsua]], [[Kalajoki]], [[Kannus]], [[Kaustinen]], [[Kronoby]], [[Lestij\u00e4rvi]], [[Larsmo]] and [[Toholampi]].\n\nThe municipality is bilingual with {{Formatnum: {{pct|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/native language Finnish|Kokkola}}|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/native language total|Kokkola}}|1}}}} being [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and {{Formatnum: {{pct|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/native language Swedish|Kokkola}}|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/native language total|Kokkola}}|1}}}} [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]] speakers.\n\nKokkola will celebrate its 400th anniversary in 2020.\n\n== Name ==\n\n{{stack|[[File:Kokkola railway station bilingual sign.jpg|thumb|300px|The bilingual sign at the train station.]]}}\nThe Finnish name ''Kokkola'' means \"place of bonfire\" or \"place of eagle\" because the Finnish [[root word]] {{lang|fi|kokko}} means both [[bonfire]] and [[white-tailed eagle]] (the [[Affix|suffix]] ''-la'' denotes location). The town was known in Swedish by the name {{lang|sv|Gamlakarleby}} until 1 January 1977 when the surrounding land municipality of Kaarlela ({{lang-sv|Karleby}}) was consolidated with Kokkola, and the town took over the Swedish name of {{lang|sv|Karleby}}. The word {{lang|sv|gamla}} means \"old\", ''karl'' means \"man\" or \"peasant\" and ''by'' means \"village\", in tearn literally meaning '\"old village of peasants\" or [[Anglicised]] as \"Old Peasantville\". The Latin name was ''Carolina Vetus''.\n\n== History ==\n{{stack|[[File:Kaarlela church.jpg|thumb|210px|Kaarlela church]]}}\nThe town of Kokkola was chartered in 1620 by King [[Gustav II Adolf]] of Sweden when Finland was a part of the [[Swedish Empire]] and is one among the oldest towns in Finland. The king also decided that a tar barrel, with three burning flames coming from both the ends and the plug, should be used as the town seal, because of the [[tar]] trade at that time, for which Kokkola was founded as a shipping port. [[Anders Chydenius]] (1729-1803) who was one of the leading politicians of [[Sweden-Finland]], was a keen supporter of economic freedom and fought in the [[Swedish Parliament]] for free foreign trade and further social reforms. In 1765 the Swedish Parliament granted the city of Kokkola the [[staple right]]s. Kokkola also became an important [[shipbuilding]] centre in Finland. As a result of tar trade and shipbuilding industry, Kokkola was for a time one of the richest towns in Finland.\n\nAn interesting historical affair, known as the [[Baltic theatre of the Crimean War#Baltic theatre|Skirmish of Halkokari]], occurred at the town on 6 June 1854 during the [[Crimean War]]. [[Royal Marines]] from [[HMS Vulture (1843)|HMS Vulture]] and [[HMS Odin (1846)|HMS Odin]] tried to come ashore to deal with public property in the town \"in accordance with the usages of war\". The marines were repelled by local defenders armed with hunting rifles supported by troops, artillery and possibly Russian advisors and military. One of the 9 smaller British craft (a [[gunboat]]) fell into the hands of the defenders. As such, this boat was the only Royal Navy vessel still in foreign possession in 1914. The boat is still today a museum-object and can be seen in Kokkola's English Park. The town council has refused to return the boat despite several requests by the United Kingdom, most recently by [[John Stuttard]], the Lord Mayor of London. The British Treasury annually pays a small sum to the local church congregation for the maintenance of the graves of nine Royal Marines killed in action during the skirmish .<ref name=\"jakobstads_tidning\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.jakobstadstidning.fi/story.aspx?storyID=6169 |title=Jakobstads Tidning |access-date=13 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235730/http://www.jakobstadstidning.fi/story.aspx?storyID=6169 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nInteresting contemporaneous accounts of the disastrous action can be found in the British Newspaper Archive, citing Gamla Carleby.\n\nThe city had a Swedish-speaking majority until 1933.\n\nIn 1977, the surrounding municipality of Kaarlela ({{lang-sv|Karleby}}) was consolidated into Kokkola (Swedish until then: {{lang|sv|Gamlakarleby}}). In 2009, the municipalities of [[Lohtaja]], [[K\u00e4lvi\u00e4]] and [[Ullava]] were consolidated with Kokkola.\n\n2020: Kokkola is also home to a stupid retard called Matte. His Discord is as follows \"A person#8354\"\n\n== Geography ==\n\nKokkola is the capital of the [[Central Ostrobothnia]] region, it is located on the coast of [[Gulf of Bothnia]], the northernmost part of the [[Baltic Sea]]. The next larger cities are [[Vaasa]] is {{convert|121|km|0|abbr=off}} southwest, and [[Oulu]] is {{convert|198|km|0|abbr=off}} northeast. The distance to the capital Helsinki is {{convert|483|km|0|abbr=off}} to the south. Neighbouring cities and municipals are [[Kalajoki]] in the northern east, [[Kannus]] and [[Toholampi]] in the east, [[Halsua]] and [[Kaustinen]] in the southern east, [[Kronoby]] in the south and [[Larsmo]] in the southern west.\n\nThe landscape of the region around Kokkola is flat, typical for the area of [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]], with numerous river courses flowing through the land. The biggest river in the area is [[Perhonjoki]], which flows into [[Gulf of Bothnia]], north of Kokkola.\n\nThe annual [[post-glacial rebound]] at Kokkola is 8.8&nbsp;mm. Thus large areas of present-day Kokkola were under water when the town was founded.\n\n== Population ==\n\nKokkola marks the northernmost settlement area of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland]] (Finland-Swedes) on the western coast of Finland. 84.0% of the inhabitants of Kokkola speak Finnish as their mother tongue, 12.6% Swedish.

The districts which were consolidated in 2009 are, however, pure Finnish-speaking areas.\n\n== Education ==\n\nKokkola has a lot of [[preschool]]s, some of them offer children a bilingual education from an early age (mostly Finnish-English or Finnish-Swedish). There are 25 Finnish-speaking and 8 Swedish-speaking schools. Moreover, there are three secondary schools for Finnish-speaking pupils and one for Swedish-speaking.

It is specialized in adult education. For Finnish and foreign students it arranges open university studies, further education for professionals in the fields of [[education]], [[social services]] and [[health service]]s and [[management]]. [[Centria University of Applied Sciences]] [Finnish name: ''Centria ammattikorkeakoulu''] is also situated in Kokkola having its other partition in Ylivieska and Jakobstad is an international institute offering three different bachelor's degree program in English language along with Finnish.\n\n== Economy ==\nKokkola is the capital and biggest city in the region of [[Central Ostrobothnia]].

The town has a population of {{Formatnum: {{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|Kokkola}}}} ({{#time: j F Y|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|sourcedate}} }})<ref name=\"population_count\" /> and covers an area of {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/total area|Kokkola}}|km2}} of which {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/waters area|Kokkola}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water.<ref name=\"total_area\" /> The population density is {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population density|Kokkola|round=2}}|PD/km2}}. Neighbour municipalities are [[Halsua]], [[Kalajoki]], [[Kannus]], [[Kaustinen]], [[Kronoby]], [[Lestij\u00e4rvi]], [[Larsmo]] and [[Toholampi]].\n\nThe municipality is bilingual with {{Formatnum: {{pct|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/native language Finnish|Kokkola}}|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/native language total|Kokkola}}|1}}}} being [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and {{Formatnum: {{pct|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/native language Swedish|Kokkola}}|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/native language total|Kokkola}}|1}}}} [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]] speakers.\n\nKokkola will celebrate its 400th anniversary in 2020.\n\n== Name ==\n\n{{stack|[[File:Kokkola railway station bilingual sign.jpg|thumb|300px|The bilingual sign at the train station.]]}}\nThe Finnish name ''Kokkola'' means \"place of bonfire\" or \"place of eagle\" because the Finnish [[root word]] {{lang|fi|kokko}} means both [[bonfire]] and [[white-tailed eagle]] (the [[Affix|suffix]] ''-la'' denotes location). The town was known in Swedish by the name {{lang|sv|Gamlakarleby}} until 1 January 1977 when the surrounding land municipality of Kaarlela ({{lang-sv|Karleby}}) was consolidated with Kokkola, and the town took over the Swedish name of {{lang|sv|Karleby}}. The word {{lang|sv|gamla}} means \"old\", ''karl'' means \"man\" or \"peasant\" and ''by'' means \"village\", in tearn literally meaning '\"old village of peasants\" or [[Anglicised]] as \"Old Peasantville\". The Latin name was ''Carolina Vetus''.\n\n== History ==\n{{stack|[[File:Kaarlela church.jpg|thumb|210px|Kaarlela church]]}}\nThe town of Kokkola was chartered in 1620 by King [[Gustav II Adolf]] of Sweden when Finland was a part of the [[Swedish Empire]] and is one among the oldest towns in Finland. The king also decided that a tar barrel, with three burning flames coming from both the ends and the plug, should be used as the town seal, because of the [[tar]] trade at that time, for which Kokkola was founded as a shipping port. [[Anders Chydenius]] (1729-1803) who was one of the leading politicians of [[Sweden-Finland]], was a keen supporter of economic freedom and fought in the [[Swedish Parliament]] for free foreign trade and further social reforms. In 1765 the Swedish Parliament granted the city of Kokkola the [[staple right]]s. Kokkola also became an important [[shipbuilding]] centre in Finland. As a result of tar trade and shipbuilding industry, Kokkola was for a time one of the richest towns in Finland.\n\nAn interesting historical affair, known as the [[Baltic theatre of the Crimean War#Baltic theatre|Skirmish of Halkokari]], occurred at the town on 6 June 1854 during the [[Crimean War]]. [[Royal Marines]] from [[HMS Vulture (1843)|HMS Vulture]] and [[HMS Odin (1846)|HMS Odin]] tried to come ashore to deal with public property in the town \"in accordance with the usages of war\". The marines were repelled by local defenders armed with hunting rifles supported by troops, artillery and possibly Russian advisors and military. One of the 9 smaller British craft (a [[gunboat]]) fell into the hands of the defenders. As such, this boat was the only Royal Navy vessel still in foreign possession in 1914. The boat is still today a museum-object and can be seen in Kokkola's English Park. The town council has refused to return the boat despite several requests by the United Kingdom, most recently by [[John Stuttard]], the Lord Mayor of London. The British Treasury annually pays a small sum to the local church congregation for the maintenance of the graves of nine Royal Marines killed in action during the skirmish .<ref name=\"jakobstads_tidning\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.jakobstadstidning.fi/story.aspx?storyID=6169 |title=Jakobstads Tidning |access-date=13 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235730/http://www.jakobstadstidning.fi/story.aspx?storyID=6169 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nInteresting contemporaneous accounts of the disastrous action can be found in the British Newspaper Archive, citing Gamla Carleby.\n\nThe city had a Swedish-speaking majority until 1933.\n\nIn 1977, the surrounding municipality of Kaarlela ({{lang-sv|Karleby}}) was consolidated into Kokkola (Swedish until then: {{lang|sv|Gamlakarleby}}). In 2009, the municipalities of [[Lohtaja]], [[K\u00e4lvi\u00e4]] and [[Ullava]] were consolidated with Kokkola.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nKokkola is the capital of the [[Central Ostrobothnia]] region, it is located on the coast of [[Gulf of Bothnia]], the northernmost part of the [[Baltic Sea]]. The next larger cities are [[Vaasa]] is {{convert|121|km|0|abbr=off}} southwest, and [[Oulu]] is {{convert|198|km|0|abbr=off}} northeast. The distance to the capital Helsinki is {{convert|483|km|0|abbr=off}} to the south. Neighbouring cities and municipals are [[Kalajoki]] in the northern east, [[Kannus]] and [[Toholampi]] in the east, [[Halsua]] and [[Kaustinen]] in the southern east, [[Kronoby]] in the south and [[Larsmo]] in the southern west.\n\nThe landscape of the region around Kokkola is flat, typical for the area of [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]], with numerous river courses flowing through the land. The biggest river in the area is [[Perhonjoki]], which flows into [[Gulf of Bothnia]], north of Kokkola.\n\nThe annual [[post-glacial rebound]] at Kokkola is 8.8&nbsp;mm. Thus large areas of present-day Kokkola were under water when the town was founded.\n\n== Population ==\n\nKokkola marks the northernmost settlement area of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland]] (Finland-Swedes) on the western coast of Finland. 84.0% of the inhabitants of Kokkola speak Finnish as their mother tongue, 12.6% Swedish. The remaining 3.4% speak [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] or other mother tongues. Kokkola is an official [[bilingual]] city with Finnish as the language of the majority and Swedish as the language of the minority. The approximately 6,020 Swedish-speaking inhabitants of Kokkola are spread unevenly around Kokkola: Whereas the centre of the city is bilingual, the majority of the villages around Kokkola mostly speak Swedish. The districts which were consolidated in 2009 are, however, pure Finnish-speaking areas.\n\n== Education ==\n\nKokkola has a lot of [[preschool]]s, some of them offer children a bilingual education from an early age (mostly Finnish-English or Finnish-Swedish). There are 25 Finnish-speaking and 8 Swedish-speaking schools. Moreover, there are three secondary schools for Finnish-speaking pupils and one for Swedish-speaking. Some schools offer a [[Dual education system|dual]] [[vocational education]] and training. The [[Chydenius-Institution of Kokkola]], a [[university]] [[consortium]], carries out teaching and research under the auspices of the universities of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Oulu and Vaasa. It is specialized in adult education. For Finnish and foreign students it arranges open university studies, further education for professionals in the fields of [[education]], [[social services]] and [[health service]]s and [[management]]. [[Centria University of Applied Sciences]] [Finnish name: ''Centria ammattikorkeakoulu''] is also situated in Kokkola having its other partition in Ylivieska and Jakobstad is an international institute offering three different bachelor's degree program in English language along with Finnish.\n\n== Economy ==\nKokkola is the capital and biggest city in the region of [[Central Ostrobothnia]]. The [[chemical industry]] is a major employer. An industrial area and a port is located in Ykspihlaja. [[OM Group|OMG]] has a [[cobalt]] plant. The Freeport/Umicore refinery is the only large cobalt refinery outside China.<ref name=freeumi/> [[Boliden]] has a [[zinc]] plant. [[Kemira]], a chemical conglomerate, built an industrial park that is now divided among several corporations. In addition, industries represented in the town include metalworking, casting, textiles, plastics, food and carpentry. Largest employers are as follows (2011):\n* The city of Kokkola approx. 2.350\n* Central Ostrobothnian Joint Municipal Authority for Social and Health Services (Soite) 2.500\n* Boliden Kokkola Oy (zinc) 500\n* [[Umicore]] (was Freeport Cobalt Oy until 2019)<ref name=freeumi>{{cite web |title=Umicore completes US$203 million Kokkola acquisition |url=https://www.mining-journal.com/m-amp-a/news/1376945/umicore-completes-ususd203-million-kokkola-acquisition |website=www.mining-journal.com |language=en |date=2 December 2019}}</ref> (cobalt) 420\n* [[S-Group|KPO]] group (retail) 400\n* Halpa-Halli (retail) 300\n* CABB Oy (fine chemicals) 200\n\nThe port of Kokkola is located in Ykspihlaja, approximately {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city center, and it is one of the busiest ports in Finland. Oil, ore and limestone are imported, refined products and timber are exported, and iron ore is transited.\n\n== Transport ==\n{{stack|[[File:Tk3 1159.jpg|thumb|210px|Steam locomotive [[VR Class Tk3]] 1105 at Kokkola]]}}\nKokkola is located on the coast of [[Gulf of Bothnia]], and the coastal [[European route E8]] (Finnish highway 8) goes through, connecting [[Oulu]] and [[Turku]] via [[Vaasa]]. Finnish highway 28 begins from Kokkola and runs to [[Kajaani]]. Finnish highway 13 begins from Kokkola and runs through Finland into the [[Nuijamaa]] border to [[Russia]] crossing via [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]] and [[Mikkeli]].

It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in August 2017, followed by versions on [[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 5]], and [[Xbox Series X]]. ''Observer'' follows Daniel Lazarski, a detective known as an Observer, who can [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] people's minds as a method of interrogation and employ [[Augmented reality|augmented vision]] to investigate his surroundings.\n\nA team of around thirty developed the game using the [[Unreal Engine 4]]. It stars [[Rutger Hauer]], who was also in ''[[Blade Runner]]'', one of the game's primary influences. Arkadiusz Reikowski composed the score, infusing it with [[Choral music|choral]], [[Diegetic music|diegetic]] and [[ambient music]]. ''Observer'' received generally favourable reviews from critics. They praised the world design, visual effects and hacking sequences but criticised the stealth areas and its focus on style over substance.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Observer gameplay.png|thumb|left|Daniel's Electromagnetic Vision scans for a brain implant.]]\n''Observer'' is a [[psychological horror]]<ref name=\"BlooberTeam\" />{{efn|The developer described it as \"hidden horror\" or \"catharsis 2.0\", a self-proclaimed subgenre more concerned with catharsis.<ref name=\"catharsis\" /><ref name=\"Harris-Nov2017\" />}} video game played from a [[First-person narrative|first-person]] perspective.<ref name=\"cyberpunk\" /><ref name=\"perspective\" /> The player controls Daniel Lazarski, a [[Krak\u00f3w]]ian detective of the Observers police unit. He can hack people's brain implants with a device known as the Dream Eater, for interrogation purposes.<ref name=\"catharsis\" /><ref name=\"perspective\" /><ref name=\"observer\" /> Equipped with [[Augmented reality|augmented vision]] split into Electromagnetic Vision\u2014which scans for electronic devices\u2014and Bio Vision\u2014which scans for biological evidence<ref name=\"313ctr0810\" />\u2014he is able to analyse and highlight certain objects in his environment.<ref name=\"plague\" /> Objects can be interacted with and examined, while [[dialogue tree]]s are used for speaking with non-player characters.<ref name=\"objects\" /> ''Nanophage'' cards, patient records, [[radio-controlled car]]s and [[rose]]s serve as collectibles. A mini-game called ''With Fire and Sword: Spiders'' is accessed through [[computer terminal]]s, which can also be used to read documents.<ref name=\"observer\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Observer'' is set in 2084 Krak\u00f3w, [[Poland]] after the ''nanophage'',<ref name=\"observer\" /> a \"digital plague\" that cost the lives of thousands, resulting in war and rampant drug use.<ref name=\"plague\" /> After Chiron, a [[megacorporation]], took control of Poland and manifested the Fifth Polish Republic, a police unit known as Observers was put in control of the denizens with license to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] their minds. Drug and [[hologram]] addicts were made [[Social class|Class]] C and cast off to live in [[tenement]] buildings.<ref name=\"xbone\" />\n\nOne morning, Observer detective Daniel Lazarski receives a call from his estranged son Adam, whose [[caller ID]] is traced to a tenement building. Locating Adam's apartment, Daniel discovers a body missing its head. He scans a ComPass implant and sees a missed call from \"H.N.\" Checking the tenant log, he learns the initials belong to Helena Nowak who lives in apartment 104. At this point, a [[lockdown]] has been triggered. In apartment 104, Daniel finds a moribund man called Amir and hacks his brain for clues. Given a glimpse of the [[tattoo]] parlour outside, he heads to the courtyard.<ref name=\"observer\" />\n\nHelena is found dead inside the parlour; hacking her brain reveals she was working for Adam, smuggling data out of Chiron. Daniel goes looking for Jack Karnas, the owner of the tattoo parlour, in apartment 210. He finds Jack murdered and follows a trail of the killer's blood to the attic, where he is ambushed and knocked unconscious. When he regains consciousness, he finds the killer dead and hacks the remains. Daniel continues from there and into the sewers, arriving at the killer's hideout. Adam's severed head lies underneath a cover on a table. Distraught, Daniel is met with his son's voice urging him not to connect with the severed head's implant and mentioning a place called ''Sanctuary''. He finds his way deeper underground, ending up at ''Sanctuary''{{'}}s gates.<ref name=\"observer\" />\n\nInside ''Sanctuary'', an abandoned [[virtual reality]] salon, Daniel enters one of the pods. He meets Adam in the virtual world and learns that Adam's consciousness was transferred into a digital realm hoping it was out of Chiron's reach. However, Adam claims Chiron deployed a virus to break down his defences. Daniel is urged to [[Manual override|manually override]] the signal that caused the lockdown, releasing Adam from the building's [[private network]]. In the adjoining building, Adam reveals he killed the original Adam for sending the virus after him and triggered the lockdown to lead Daniel to ''Sanctuary''. Adam asks that he be hosted in Daniel's Observer mind to save what is left of his son; if Daniel accepts, Adam takes full control over him. If he refuses, Adam transfers Daniel's consciousness into a maintenance drone and steals his body. Daniel manages to steal the body of the drone's owner and uses it to attack Adam but is shot dead by police as the lockdown is finally lifted.<ref name=\"observer\" />\n\n==Development and release==\nAt Krak\u00f3w-based [[Bloober Team]], a staff, at times exceeding thirty members, developed ''Observer'' with [[Unreal Engine 4]].<ref name=\"Harris-Nov2017\" /><ref name=\"unr341\" /> By December 2015, the game was in [[pre-production]] with one of two scripts bearing its concept. Development began with the idea of changing the setting from that of the studio's previous title, ''[[Layers of Fear]]'', to a [[dystopia]]n society embellished with 1980s and '90s references to Eastern European culture and architecture,<ref name=\"Harris-Nov2017\" /><ref name=\"xbone\" /> and adding in-game propaganda reminiscent of the [[Soviet Union]]. Influences included ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'', and comic books; all used so that the game could distinguish itself from American and Japanese [[cyberpunk]].<ref name=\"Harris-Nov2017\" /> The ever-changing level design in hacking sequences features [[Compression artifact|compression artefact effects]].<ref name=\"plague\" /> HRZ3D Studio worked on the opening intro; frameshunter contributed additional animations.<ref name=\"credits\" /> The involvement of [[Rutger Hauer]], who plays the lead, was revealed in July 2017: Hauer had previously starred in ''Blade Runner''.<ref name=\"Porreca-2017\" /> Arkadiusz Reikowski composed the soundtrack,<ref name=\"ps4\" /> which was influenced by the music of ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' and ''Blade Runner''. Reikowski used an [[analogue synthesizer]] to keep faithful to the atmosphere, worked with the Polish band [[:pl:Ksi\u0119\u017cyc (zesp\u00f3\u0142 muzyczny)|Ksi\u0119\u017cyc]] for the [[choral music]] (using words intended as ominous, alien and ritual) and employed [[diegetic music]] by [[psytrance]] artist Mirror Me. Przemek Laszczyk, with whom Reikowski worked on the 2015 video game ''[[Kholat (video game)|Kholat]]'', provided additional [[ambient music]] like the tattoo parlour theme.<ref name=\"Broda-Aug2017\" /> ''Observer'' was unveiled at the PC Gaming Show during [[E3 2016]].<ref name=\"perspective\" /> The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on 15 August 2017,<ref name=\"plague\" /><ref name=\"xbone\" /><ref name=\"Porreca-2017\" /><ref name=\"ps4\" /> and launched for [[macOS]] and [[Linux]] on 24 October.<ref name=\"Aspyr-Oct2017\" /> [[Techland]] published a limited edition in Poland;<ref name=\"Forsal.pl-Jul2017\" /> [[Limited Run Games]] released a [[Video game packaging|physical]] version for PlayStation 4 in July 2018.<ref name=\"Romano-Jun2018\" /> ''Observer'' was released for [[Nintendo Switch]] on 7 February 2019.<ref name=\"Romano-Feb2019\" /> ''Observer: System Redux'', a version featuring more story content and enhanced visuals and gameplay, was announced in April 2020 is slated for release on [[PlayStation 5]] and [[Xbox Series X]] in the fourth quarter of that year.<ref name=\"McWhertor-Apr2020\" />\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = PC: 78/100<ref name=\"MCPC\" /><br />PS4: 77/100<ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><br />XONE: 86/100<ref name=\"MCXONE\" /><br />NS: 75/100<ref name=\"MCNS\" />\n| GI = 9/10<ref name=\"GI\" />\n| GameRev = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"GameRev\" />\n| GSpot = 9/10<ref name=\"GSpot\" />\n| PCGUS = 45/100<ref name=\"PCGUS\" />\n| SN = 9/10<ref name=\"Shacknews\" />\n}}\n\nAccording to [[Metacritic]], ''Observer'' received generally favourable reviews.<ref name=\"MCPC\" /><ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><ref name=\"MCXONE\" /><ref name=\"MCNS\" /> It was a runner-up for the Best World award at ''[[Giant Bomb]]''{{'}}s 2017 Game of the Year Awards,<ref name=\"GB-2017\" /> and won for Best Setting in ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s 2017 Adventure Game of the Year Awards.<ref name=\"GI-2017\" /> ''[[Eurogamer]]'' ranked it 34th on their list of the Top 50 Games of 2017,<ref name=\"EuroGTop50\" /> while ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' ranked it 46th on their list of the 50 best games of 2017.<ref name=\"PolygonTop50\" /> The game was also nominated for Use of Sound, New IP at the [[National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers]] Awards,<ref name=\"NAVGTRNoms\" /><ref name=\"NAVGTRWinners\" /> and won the award for Best Emotional Indie Game at the Emotional Games Awards 2018.<ref name=\"Moyse-Mar2018\" />\n\n''Game Informer''{{'}}s Javy Gwaltney wrote \"''Observer'' makes the most of its fusion of cyberpunk sci-fi and terror\", citing the minimalistic setting as something that distinguished it from other futuristic stories. He commended the hacking sequences for being \"intense, terrifying\" and interesting. The game was praised for its puzzles, consistent scares and plot revelations, which Gwaltney thought kept it from being boring, despite the lack of combat.<ref name=\"GI\" /> Brittany Vincent of ''[[Game Revolution]]'' said the game was, \"by far\", among the best of the year. She felt the exploration was thrilling and declared the atmosphere and visual effects during hacking sequences \"masterful\".<ref name=\"GameRev\" /> David Rayfield at ''[[GameSpot]]'' praised the detailed environments and found the story to be \"one of the most intriguing\" in the genre in years. He felt the ability to open doors inches at a time added to the horror. He liked the blend of the sound design with Reikowski\u2019s music, and how the writing made \"even the most fleeting of characters\" genuine.<ref name=\"GSpot\" /> Writing for ''[[PC Gamer]]'', Jody Macgregor said certain moments of \"surrealness\" were effective, finding the visual effects \"genuinely shocking\" at times. The [[Cat and mouse|cat-and-mouse]] levels were lauded for \"livening up the dreams\".<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> ''[[Shacknews]]''{{'}} Chris Jarrard agreed with Rayfield that the \"hyper-detailed world\" made an impression. He observed a \"superb\" use of [[binaural recording]] and thought the pacing was \"excellent\".<ref name=\"Shacknews\" />\n\nConversely, Gwaltney criticised Rutger Hauer's line delivery and the stealth sequences where the task is to avoid a monster.<ref name=\"GI\" /> Vincent and Rayfield both disparaged the stealth areas, calling them \"frustrating\".<ref name=\"GameRev\" /><ref name=\"GSpot\" /> Macgregor complained that, although the visual effects looked \"kind of cool\", they eventually lost their appeal; similarly, she called the cat-and-mouse sequences \"overused\". Other complaints included the use of [[jump scare]]s and a disappointing plot.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> Jarrard saw the exploration as \"cumbersome and mildly {{sic|off putting}}\".<ref name=\"Shacknews\" />\n\n==Film adaptation==\nIn December 2017, a film adaptation with American production company Zero Gravity was announced, increasing the value of Bloober Team's [[Share

It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in August 2017, followed by versions on [[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 5]], and [[Xbox Series X]]. ''Observer'' follows Daniel Lazarski, a detective known as an Observer, who can [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] people's minds as a method of interrogation and employ [[Augmented reality|augmented vision]] to investigate his surroundings.\n\nA team of around thirty developed the game using the [[Unreal Engine 4]]. It stars [[Rutger Hauer]], who was also in ''[[Blade Runner]]'', one of the game's primary influences. Arkadiusz Reikowski composed the score, infusing it with [[Choral music|choral]], [[Diegetic music|diegetic]] and [[ambient music]]. ''Observer'' received generally favourable reviews from critics. They praised the world design, visual effects and hacking sequences but criticised the stealth areas and its focus on style over substance.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Observer gameplay.png|thumb|left|Daniel's Electromagnetic Vision scans for a brain implant.]]\n''Observer'' is a [[psychological horror]]<ref name=\"BlooberTeam\" />{{efn|The developer described it as \"hidden horror\" or \"catharsis 2.0\", a self-proclaimed subgenre more concerned with catharsis.<ref name=\"catharsis\" /><ref name=\"Harris-Nov2017\" />}} video game played from a [[First-person narrative|first-person]] perspective.<ref name=\"cyberpunk\" /><ref name=\"perspective\" /> The player controls Daniel Lazarski, a [[Krak\u00f3w]]ian detective of the Observers police unit. He can hack people's brain implants with a device known as the Dream Eater, for interrogation purposes.<ref name=\"catharsis\" /><ref name=\"perspective\" /><ref name=\"observer\" /> Equipped with [[Augmented reality|augmented vision]] split into Electromagnetic Vision\u2014which scans for electronic devices\u2014and Bio Vision\u2014which scans for biological evidence<ref name=\"313ctr0810\" />\u2014he is able to analyse and highlight certain objects in his environment.<ref name=\"plague\" /> Objects can be interacted with and examined, while [[dialogue tree]]s are used for speaking with non-player characters.<ref name=\"objects\" /> ''Nanophage'' cards, patient records, [[radio-controlled car]]s and [[rose]]s serve as collectibles. A mini-game called ''With Fire and Sword: Spiders'' is accessed through [[computer terminal]]s, which can also be used to read documents.<ref name=\"observer\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Observer'' is set in 2084 Krak\u00f3w, [[Poland]] after the ''nanophage'',<ref name=\"observer\" /> a \"digital plague\" that cost the lives of thousands, resulting in war and rampant drug use.<ref name=\"plague\" /> After Chiron, a [[megacorporation]], took control of Poland and manifested the Fifth Polish Republic, a police unit known as Observers was put in control of the denizens with license to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] their minds. Drug and [[hologram]] addicts were made [[Social class|Class]] C and cast off to live in [[tenement]] buildings.<ref name=\"xbone\" />\n\nOne morning, Observer detective Daniel Lazarski receives a call from his estranged son Adam, whose [[caller ID]] is traced to a tenement building. Locating Adam's apartment, Daniel discovers a body missing its head. He scans a ComPass implant and sees a missed call from \"H.N.\" Checking the tenant log, he learns the initials belong to Helena Nowak who lives in apartment 104. At this point, a [[lockdown]] has been triggered. In apartment 104, Daniel finds a moribund man called Amir and hacks his brain for clues. Given a glimpse of the [[tattoo]] parlour outside, he heads to the courtyard.<ref name=\"observer\" />\n\nHelena is found dead inside the parlour; hacking her brain reveals she was working for Adam, smuggling data out of Chiron. Daniel goes looking for Jack Karnas, the owner of the tattoo parlour, in apartment 210. He finds Jack murdered and follows a trail of the killer's blood to the attic, where he is ambushed and knocked unconscious. When he regains consciousness, he finds the killer dead and hacks the remains. Daniel continues from there and into the sewers, arriving at the killer's hideout. Adam's severed head lies underneath a cover on a table. Distraught, Daniel is met with his son's voice urging him not to connect with the severed head's implant and mentioning a place called ''Sanctuary''. He finds his way deeper underground, ending up at ''Sanctuary''{{'}}s gates.<ref name=\"observer\" />\n\nInside ''Sanctuary'', an abandoned [[virtual reality]] salon, Daniel enters one of the pods. He meets Adam in the virtual world and learns that Adam's consciousness was transferred into a digital realm hoping it was out of Chiron's reach. However, Adam claims Chiron deployed a virus to break down his defences. Daniel is urged to [[Manual override|manually override]] the signal that caused the lockdown, releasing Adam from the building's [[private network]]. In the adjoining building, Adam reveals he killed the original Adam for sending the virus after him and triggered the lockdown to lead Daniel to ''Sanctuary''. Adam asks that he be hosted in Daniel's Observer mind to save what is left of his son; if Daniel accepts, Adam takes full control over him. If he refuses, Adam transfers Daniel's consciousness into a maintenance drone and steals his body. Daniel manages to steal the body of the drone's owner and uses it to attack Adam but is shot dead by police as the lockdown is finally lifted.<ref name=\"observer\" />\n\n==Development and release==\nAt Krak\u00f3w-based [[Bloober Team]], a staff, at times exceeding thirty members, developed ''Observer'' with [[Unreal Engine 4]].<ref name=\"Harris-Nov2017\" /><ref name=\"unr341\" /> By December 2015, the game was in [[pre-production]] with one of two scripts bearing its concept. Development began with the idea of changing the setting from that of the studio's previous title, ''[[Layers of Fear]]'', to a [[dystopia]]n society embellished with 1980s and '90s references to Eastern European culture and architecture,<ref name=\"Harris-Nov2017\" /><ref name=\"xbone\" /> and adding in-game propaganda reminiscent of the [[Soviet Union]]. Influences included ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'', and comic books; all used so that the game could distinguish itself from American and Japanese [[cyberpunk]].<ref name=\"Harris-Nov2017\" /> The ever-changing level design in hacking sequences features [[Compression artifact|compression artefact effects]].<ref name=\"plague\" /> HRZ3D Studio worked on the opening intro; frameshunter contributed additional animations.<ref name=\"credits\" /> The involvement of [[Rutger Hauer]], who plays the lead, was revealed in July 2017: Hauer had previously starred in ''Blade Runner''.<ref name=\"Porreca-2017\" /> Arkadiusz Reikowski composed the soundtrack,<ref name=\"ps4\" /> which was influenced by the music of ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' and ''Blade Runner''. Reikowski used an [[analogue synthesizer]] to keep faithful to the atmosphere, worked with the Polish band [[:pl:Ksi\u0119\u017cyc (zesp\u00f3\u0142 muzyczny)|Ksi\u0119\u017cyc]] for the [[choral music]] (using words intended as ominous, alien and ritual) and employed [[diegetic music]] by [[psytrance]] artist Mirror Me. Przemek Laszczyk, with whom Reikowski worked on the 2015 video game ''[[Kholat (video game)|Kholat]]'', provided additional [[ambient music]] like the tattoo parlour theme.<ref name=\"Broda-Aug2017\" /> ''Observer'' was unveiled at the PC Gaming Show during [[E3 2016]].<ref name=\"perspective\" /> The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on 15 August 2017,<ref name=\"plague\" /><ref name=\"xbone\" /><ref name=\"Porreca-2017\" /><ref name=\"ps4\" /> and launched for [[macOS]] and [[Linux]] on 24 October.<ref name=\"Aspyr-Oct2017\" /> [[Techland]] published a limited edition in Poland;<ref name=\"Forsal.pl-Jul2017\" /> [[Limited Run Games]] released a [[Video game packaging|physical]] version for PlayStation 4 in July 2018.<ref name=\"Romano-Jun2018\" /> ''Observer'' released for [[Nintendo Switch]] on 7 February 2019.<ref name=\"Romano-Feb2019\" /> ''Observer: System Redux'', a version featuring more story content and enhanced visuals and gameplay, was announced in April 2020 is slated for release on [[PlayStation 5]] and [[Xbox Series X]] in the fourth quarter of that year.<ref name=\"McWhertor-Apr2020\" />\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = PC: 78/100<ref name=\"MCPC\" /><br />PS4: 77/100<ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><br />XONE: 86/100<ref name=\"MCXONE\" /><br />NS: 75/100<ref name=\"MCNS\" />\n| GI = 9/10<ref name=\"GI\" />\n| GameRev = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"GameRev\" />\n| GSpot = 9/10<ref name=\"GSpot\" />\n| PCGUS = 45/100<ref name=\"PCGUS\" />\n| SN = 9/10<ref name=\"Shacknews\" />\n}}\n\nAccording to [[Metacritic]], ''Observer'' received generally favourable reviews.<ref name=\"MCPC\" /><ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><ref name=\"MCXONE\" /><ref name=\"MCNS\" /> It was a runner-up for the Best World award at ''[[Giant Bomb]]''{{'}}s 2017 Game of the Year Awards,<ref name=\"GB-2017\" /> and won for Best Setting in ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s 2017 Adventure Game of the Year Awards.<ref name=\"GI-2017\" /> ''[[Eurogamer]]'' ranked it 34th on their list of the Top 50 Games of 2017,<ref name=\"EuroGTop50\" /> while ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' ranked it 46th on their list of the 50 best games of 2017.<ref name=\"PolygonTop50\" /> The game was also nominated for Use of Sound, New IP at the [[National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers]] Awards,<ref name=\"NAVGTRNoms\" /><ref name=\"NAVGTRWinners\" /> and won the award for Best Emotional Indie Game at the Emotional Games Awards 2018.<ref name=\"Moyse-Mar2018\" />\n\n''Game Informer''{{'}}s Javy Gwaltney wrote \"''Observer'' makes the most of its fusion of cyberpunk sci-fi and terror\", citing the minimalistic setting as something that distinguished it from other futuristic stories. He commended the hacking sequences for being \"intense, terrifying\" and interesting. The game was praised for its puzzles, consistent scares and plot revelations, which Gwaltney thought kept it from being boring, despite the lack of combat.<ref name=\"GI\" /> Brittany Vincent of ''[[Game Revolution]]'' said the game was, \"by far\", among the best of the year. She felt the exploration was thrilling and declared the atmosphere and visual effects during hacking sequences \"masterful\".<ref name=\"GameRev\" /> David Rayfield at ''[[GameSpot]]'' praised the detailed environments and found the story to be \"one of the most intriguing\" in the genre in years. He felt the ability to open doors inches at a time added to the horror. He liked the blend of the sound design with Reikowski\u2019s music, and how the writing made \"even the most fleeting of characters\" genuine.<ref name=\"GSpot\" /> Writing for ''[[PC Gamer]]'', Jody Macgregor said certain moments of \"surrealness\" were effective, finding the visual effects \"genuinely shocking\" at times. The [[Cat and mouse|cat-and-mouse]] levels were lauded for \"livening up the dreams\".<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> ''[[Shacknews]]''{{'}} Chris Jarrard agreed with Rayfield that the \"hyper-detailed world\" made an impression. He observed a \"superb\" use of [[binaural recording]] and thought the pacing was \"excellent\".<ref name=\"Shacknews\" />\n\nConversely, Gwaltney criticised Rutger Hauer's line delivery and the stealth sequences where the task is to avoid a monster.<ref name=\"GI\" /> Vincent and Rayfield both disparaged the stealth areas, calling them \"frustrating\".<ref name=\"GameRev\" /><ref name=\"GSpot\" /> Macgregor complained that, although the visual effects looked \"kind of cool\", they eventually lost their appeal; similarly, she called the cat-and-mouse sequences \"overused\". Other complaints included the use of [[jump scare]]s and a disappointing plot.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> Jarrard saw the exploration as \"cumbersome and mildly {{sic|off putting}}\".<ref name=\"Shacknews\" />\n\n==Film adaptation==\nIn December 2017, a film adaptation with American production company Zero Gravity was announced, increasing the value of Bloober Team's [[Share

Article Begins Here -->\n\nThe '''mustang''' is a free-roaming [[horse]] of the [[Western United States]], descended from horses brought to the [[Americas]] by the [[Spain|Spanish]].  Mustangs are often referred to as [[wild horse]]s, but because they are descended from once-[[domestication of the horse|domesticated]] horses, they are actually [[feral horse]]s.  The original mustangs were [[Colonial Spanish horse]]s, but many other breeds and types of horses contributed to the modern mustang, now resulting in varying [[phenotypes]]. Some free-roaming horses are relatively unchanged from the original Spanish stock, most strongly represented in the most isolated populations.\n\nIn 1971, the [[United States Congress]] recognized that \"wild free-roaming horses and burros are living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West, which continue to contribute to the diversity of life forms within the Nation and enrich the lives of the American people.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-creatures.org/alert/alert-20110920.pdf|title=The Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, as amended|accessdate=April 26, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529174156/http://www.all-creatures.org/alert/alert-20110920.pdf|archivedate=May 29, 2013}}</ref>  The free-roaming horse population is managed and protected by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM). Controversy surrounds the sharing of land and resources by mustangs with the [[livestock]] of the [[ranching]] industry, and also with the methods by which the BLM manages their population numbers. The most common method of population management used is rounding up excess population and offering them to adoption by private individuals. There are inadequate numbers of adopters, so many once free-roaming horses now live in temporary and long-term holding areas with concerns that the animals may be sold for [[horsemeat|horse meat]]. Additional debate centers on the question of whether mustangs\u2014and horses in general\u2014are a [[native species]] or an introduced [[invasive species]] in the lands they occupy.\n\n==Etymology and usage==\nMustangs are known as wild horses but, unlike [[Przewalski's horse]], possibly the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] wild horse,{{efn|Recent studies suggest the Przewalski may have been briefly domesticated millennia ago.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.amnh.org/explore/science-bulletins/bio/documentaries/the-last-wild-horse-the-return-of-takhi-to-mongolia/article-when-is-wild-actually-feral|title = When Is \"Wild\" Actually \"Feral\"?|accessdate = May 25, 2015|publisher = American Museum of Natural History|series = The Last Wild Horse: The Return of Takhi to Mongolia Bio Feature|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150507090059/http://www.amnh.org/explore/science-bulletins/bio/documentaries/the-last-wild-horse-the-return-of-takhi-to-mongolia/article-when-is-wild-actually-feral|archive-date = May 7, 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/ancient-dna-upends-horse-family-tree|title=Ancient DNA upends the horse family tree|date=2018-02-22|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en}}</ref>}} the mustang descended from domesticated horses.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.amnh.org/explore/science-bulletins/bio/documentaries/the-last-wild-horse-the-return-of-takhi-to-mongolia/article-when-is-wild-actually-feral|title = When Is \"Wild\" Actually \"Feral\"?|accessdate = May 25, 2015|publisher = American Museum of Natural History|series = The Last Wild Horse: The Return of Takhi to Mongolia Bio Feature|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150507090059/http://www.amnh.org/explore/science-bulletins/bio/documentaries/the-last-wild-horse-the-return-of-takhi-to-mongolia/article-when-is-wild-actually-feral|archivedate = May 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), the English word \"mustang\" comes from two essentially synonymous [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words, ''mestengo'' (or ''meste\u00f1o'') and ''mostrenco.''

Controversy surrounds the sharing of land and resources by mustangs with the [[livestock]] of the [[ranching]] industry, and also with the methods by which the BLM manages their population numbers.

Grande wanted ''My Everything'' to sound as \"an evolution\" from her debut album, ''[[Yours Truly (Ariana Grande album)|Yours Truly]]'' (2013); it explores more mature themes and music genres. In the album's production, Grande worked with a host of producers and co-writers \u2013 including [[Max Martin]], [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], [[Benny Blanco]], [[Ryan Tedder]], [[Darkchild]], [[Ilya Salmanzadeh]], [[Zedd]], and [[David Guetta]], to name a few. Upon its release, the album debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart in the United States, selling 169,000 copies in its first week there. It debuted at number one in Australia and Canada as well, and peaked in the top ten of twenty countries worldwide. As of April 2018, the album has sold 735,000 copies in the United States alone.<ref name=\"us_sales\"/>\n\n''My Everything'' was preceded by the [[lead single]] \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\", which features Australian rapper [[Iggy Azalea]]. After its release on April 28, 2014, the single debuted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart in the US at number three the week ending May 17, selling over 400,000 copies in its first week and eventually peaking at number two. \"[[Break Free (song)|Break Free]]\", featuring German-Russian musician and producer Zedd, was released as the second single on July 2, and peaked at number four on the Hot 100. The fourth single, \"[[Love Me Harder]]\", with Canadian recording artist [[The Weeknd]], was released on September 30, 2014 and eventually peaked at number seven in the US, while final single \"[[One Last Time (Ariana Grande song)|One Last Time]]\" reached number thirteen.

It debuted at number one in Australia and Canada as well, and peaked in the top ten of twenty countries worldwide. As of April 2018, the album has sold 735,000 copies in the United States alone.<ref name=\"us_sales\"/>\n\n''My Everything'' was preceded by the [[lead single]] \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\", which features Australian rapper [[Iggy Azalea]]. After its release on April 28, 2014, the single debuted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart in the US at number three the week ending May 17, selling over 400,000 copies in its first week and eventually peaking at number two. \"[[Break Free (song)|Break Free]]\", featuring German-Russian musician and producer Zedd, was released as the second single on July 2, and peaked at number four on the Hot 100. The fourth single, \"[[Love Me Harder]]\", with Canadian recording artist [[The Weeknd]], was released on September 30, 2014 and eventually peaked at number seven in the US, while final single \"[[One Last Time (Ariana Grande song)|One Last Time]]\" reached number thirteen.

{"title_page": "Next Generation Air Transportation System", "text_new": "{{short description|Modernization project of the United States' National Airspace System}}\n{{advert|date=May 2018}}\nThe '''Next Generation Air Transportation System''' ('''NextGen''')  is an ongoing modernization project of the [[United States]] [[National Airspace System]] (NAS). The US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) began work on NextGen improvements in 2007 and plans to have all major components in place by 2025.<ref>[https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/BusinessCaseForNextGen-2016.pdf 2016 Update to The Business Case for the Next Generation Air Transportation System] based on the Future of the NAS Report</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe goals of the modernization include using new technologies and procedures to increase the safety, efficiency, capacity, access, flexibility, predictability, and resilience of the NAS while reducing the [[environmental impact of aviation]].\n\n== History ==\nThe need for NextGen became apparent during the summer of 2000 when air travel was impeded by severe congestion and costly delays. Two years later, the Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry recommended that a multi-agency task force develop an integrated plan to transform the U.S. air transportation system. In 2003, Congress enacted the Vision 100 \u2013 Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, which established the [[Joint Planning and Development Office]] (JPDO) to create a unified vision of what the U.S. air transportation system should deliver for the next generation and beyond, to develop and coordinate long-term research plans, and to sponsor cross-agency mission research.\n\nThe result of the JPDO's efforts was the creation of the \u201cIntegrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tg.hfes.org/astg/papers/Natl_Plan_NGATS_v5.pdf|title=Integrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which defined high-level goals, objectives, and requirements to transform the air transportation system. In addition to the Department of Transportation and FAA, the plan involved other government agencies with responsibilities in air transportation services, including the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), [[National Weather Service]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and [[Transportation Security Administration]].\n\nThe JPDO released the \u201cConcept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|title=Concept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012213821/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|archive-date=2015-10-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> to the aviation stakeholder community in 2007. The concept of operations provided the overview of NextGen goals for 2025. Growth of the NextGen concept was an evolutionary, step-by-step process, and the JPDO document continued to be updated through 2011. The same year, the FAA published the first version of its expanded Operational Evolution Partnership,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nextor.org/Conferences/200709_NAS_Performance/0905_2b_Swennson%20-%20OEP.pdf|title=Operational Evolution Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which outlined the agency's path to NextGen through 2025.\n\nThe original integrated national plan included airport surface and passenger terminal operations and was known as a \u201ccurb-to-curb\u201d solution. The concept of operations was intended to drive cross-agency research to validate the concepts and to eliminate ideas and alternatives that were not operationally feasible or beneficial. The FAA focused on the pieces of the air transportation system for which it was responsible \u2013 the \u201cgate-to-gate\u201d components. In 2011, the FAA published the report \u201cNextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations for the National Airspace System\u201d. The FAA concept of operations was consistent with the JPDO's broad set of objectives, including maintaining safety and security, increasing capacity and efficiency, ensuring access to airspace and airports, and mitigating environmental impacts. The report identified several key transformational concepts as necessary to achieve NextGen goals and objectives, such as precision navigation and network-enabled information access, and the FAA has made progress on them.\n\nChanges were underway in 2008 when the FAA started to move key parts of NextGen, such as [[Automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast|Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast]] (ADS-B), from design to delivery. NextGen progress involved expanded research and development capability, participation by the aviation industry and international partners, and support by the White House and Congress (which are highlighted in this section).\n\nThe agency established a research and development facility, known as a testbed, at [[Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University|Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], Florida, in 2008. In 2010, the FAA dedicated another testbed, the NextGen Integration and Evaluation Capability Laboratory at the [[William J. Hughes Technical Center]] in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for researchers to simulate and evaluate the effects of NextGen components on the NAS. The lab's capability grew in 2013 with a contract awarded to [[General Dynamics]] to provide engineering, software design and development, infrastructure, and administrative support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.generaldynamics.com/news/press-releases/2013/03/general-dynamics-awarded-12-million-support-federal-aviation|title=General Dynamics Awarded $12 Million to Support Federal Aviation Administration System Engineering 2020 Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the FAA signed agreements with [[Honeywell]] and ACSS to accelerate testing and installation of NextGen technology to detect and alert pilots of safety hazards on the airport surface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2008/11/03/faa-signs-contract-with-honeywell-acss/|title=FAA Signs Contract with Honeywell, ACSS|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> [[NetJets]] also agreed to equip part of its fleet to test some programs in various areas of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netjets.com/News/2015/faa-partners-with-netjets-on-implementing-nextgen-technologies--/|title=FAA Partners With NetJets on Implementing NextGen Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> By 2010, the FAA awarded [[Computer Support Services]] Inc. a $280 million contract to perform engineering work for NextGen, the first of six contracts that would be awarded under an umbrella portfolio contract.

In 2011, the FAA signed an agreement with [[JetBlue]] to allow the carrier to fly select flights equipped with ADS-B, opening the airline to improved routing and giving the FAA NextGen data through real-time operational evaluations. [[United Airlines]] in 2013 announced plans to become the first carrier to equip a portion of its fleet with avionics necessary for [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] (Data Comm) under the FAA NextGen Data Comm avionics equipage program. The program was funded to equip 1,900 aircraft across the industry to ensure enough aircraft would participate in Data Comm.\n\nTo develop industry consensus for the FAA's midterm goals, the agency established a new task force carried out through [[RTCA, Incorporated|RTCA]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|title=NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force Report Sept. 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812102308/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAA wanted the task force to examine how industry could contribute to and benefit from the NextGen effort; accordingly, the agency released a plan in 2010 on how to implement recommendations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|title=FAA Response to Recommendations of the RTCA NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824192936/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe NextGen Advisory Committee (NAC),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>  established in 2010 to address the task force recommendation to continue industry collaboration, is a federal advisory group comprising aviation stakeholders formed to provide advice on policy-level NextGen implementation issues facing the aviation community. The FAA and NAC in 2014 agreed on the NextGen Priorities Joint Implementation Plan to accelerate delivery of four core NextGen initiatives over three years to improve efficiency: optimizing airports with multiple runways (e.g. via simultaneous parallel landings with reduced separation), increasing the efficiency of surface operations, reconfiguring the navigation system from ground-based to primarily satellite-based, and improving communications between aircraft and the ground through a digital system.\n\nThe FAA seeks to ensure international [[air traffic management]] interoperability and system harmonization for improved safety and efficiency. In 2010, the FAA and the European Commission agreed to cooperate in 22 areas to help in joint research and development of NextGen and [[Single European Sky ATM Research]] (SESAR) projects. By 2012, the FAA and the A6 alliance of European air navigation service providers agreed to work toward an interoperable aviation system, and work together to deploy and implement NextGen and SESAR.\n\nExecutive Order 13479, Transformation of the National Air Transportation System,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=84969|title=Executive Order 13479\u2014Transformation of the National Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> signed in 2008 mandated the Secretary of Transportation to establish a NextGen support staff.

The FAA also issued a final rule mandating NextGen performance requirements for aircraft surveillance equipment. It requires aircraft operating in most controlled U.S. airspace to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020.\n\n==Justification==\nA Department of Transportation 30-year outlook report published in 2016, \u201cBeyond Traffic: Trends and Choices 2045,\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transportation.gov/policy-initiatives/beyond-traffic-2045-final-report|title=Beyond Traffic: 2045 Final Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> estimated flight delays and congestion cost the U.S. economy more than $20 billion each year.

The agency worked with industry to identify capabilities taking advantage of existing aircraft equipage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> This strategy enabled airspace users to realize early benefits while keeping NextGen on course to achieve its long-term goal of time-based air traffic management.\n\nNext, the FAA started replacing its foundational infrastructure. Based on previous lessons learned, the agency determined the best way to upgrade its services was to begin with a new infrastructure that could accommodate state-of-the-art enabling technologies and advanced capabilities rather than adding one-off improvements to an aging infrastructure that couldn't accommodate broader transformation.\n\nFAA modernization programs, such as [[ERAM|En Route Automation Modernization]] (ERAM) and [[Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System|Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement]] (TAMR), are foundational pieces upon which the FAA could build the NextGen vision. These programs support NextGen objectives with modern software architectures that serve as the platform for new capabilities for air traffic controllers and managers.\n\nThe FAA uses a widely accepted model for building large-scale automation systems. Program lifecycles are continuous with a planned schedule of technology refreshes. For example, the FAA finished installing the original hardware for ERAM in 2008, and completed software and program acceptance in 2015. In 2016, the agency updated the technology of all major system components that were becoming obsolete. This is a common approach to maintain the latest level of technology.\n\nOn top of the foundational systems, the FAA then identified key enabling systems that improve communication, information sharing, navigation, surveillance, traffic flow optimization, and weather systems.\n\nChanges to the national airspace necessary to implement these individual concepts yield additional benefits. Integrating these systems is anticipated to transform the air traffic management system in an effort to keep pace with the growing needs of an increasingly diverse mix of air transportation system users without sacrificing safety.\n\nIntegration is necessary to achieve an FAA long-term goal of trajectory-based operations (TBO). TBO is a method of strategically planning and managing air traffic from airport to airport for optimal performance by using the aircraft's ability to fly precise paths; metering traffic flow using time instead of distance; and sharing information between pilots, flight dispatchers, and controllers and managers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ang/offices/tc/library/Storyboard/tbo.html#welcome|title=TBO Vision 2025 Storyboard|date=October 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith TBO, the FAA and operators will be able to tell with a great deal of accuracy where aircraft will be at any point in time along the way to its destination. This will provide improved knowledge of the estimated departure and arrival time at each navigational waypoint along the entire route of flight. These times will be shared between air and ground automation systems and used to improve assessments of how to balance demand and capacity, and minimize the impact of disruptions due to weather, or system or facility outages. NextGen benefits extend to all phases of flight operations.\n\nBecause NextGen is a complex, large-scale system of systems implemented over more than 18 years, its development and implementation can be difficult to follow. Systems are always in various stages of lifecycle management from research and development to technical refreshes. FAA planning reports are used to map the evolution from the legacy National Airspace System (NAS) to NextGen. To manage NextGen with short-term funding horizons, the FAA rolled out improvements in smaller increments with more program segments to ensure affordability.\n\nThe FAA has scheduled initial implementation of all major planned systems by 2025 but not the full integration necessary to provide the complete set of anticipated NextGen benefits. Beyond 2025, the FAA expects to accrue benefits through enterprise-level advanced applications, additional aircraft equipage, and full workforce adoption of a time-based air traffic management system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe FAA is using knowledge gained since 2011 when it published the NextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations. Working closely with stakeholders, the FAA invested in research and pre-implementation work to determine the feasibility of advanced concepts and their associated benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The aviation community understood that many, but not all, of the concepts would produce positive business cases once research and pre-implementation work was under way, and that some goals would be replaced by other concepts in an evolving aviation environment.

The FAA is making progress in transforming the NAS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2016-10-24/faa-declares-steady-progress-nextgen-atc-modernization|title=FAA Declares Steady Progress on NextGen ATC Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2017-02-15/faas-nextgen-making-progress-airline-pilots-union-asserts|title=FAA's NextGen Making Progress, Airline Pilots Union Asserts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2017/03/02/faa-ready-review-us-air-traffic-modernization/|title=FAA Ready to Review US Air Traffic Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2015/10/23/datacomm-eram-ads-b-huerta-touts-nextgen-milestones/|title=DataComm, ERAM, ADS-B: Huerta Touts NextGen Milestones|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSix concepts that posed too high a technical risk, for instance those with no available technical solution, have been deferred beyond 2030.

It is not one technology, product, or goal; but rather, it encompasses many technologies and procedures that are being developed and implemented after thorough safety testing. It is composed of many elements that provide benefits individually and collectively to transform the air transportation system.\n\n=== Communication ===\nController Pilot Data Link Communications, also known as [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] or just Data Comm, uses typed digital messages to supplement voice communications between air traffic controllers and pilots. The first part of the program for 55 airports, tower departure clearance services, finished in 2016 more than two years ahead of schedule. It is helping equipped aircraft take off sooner through messages quickly exchanged and clearly understood.\n\nUnlike voice messages, Data Comm messages sent by controllers are delivered only to the intended aircraft, which eliminates the chance of another pilot acting on instructions for another aircraft with a similar call sign. It avoids the chance of misunderstood messages because of busy radio chatter or variations in the way people speak, and it can be a backup if a microphone malfunctions. It also preserves radio bandwidth when voice communication is necessary or preferred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/issue/cover/88451.html?hq_e=el&hq_m=3280857&hq_l=2&hq_v=702ed8c35e|title=NextGen Data Comm Facilitates Digital DCL|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUsing Data Comm, tower air traffic controllers can send pilots of equipped aircraft departure clearance instructions to read, accept, and load into their flight management system with the push of a button. Messages also are sent to [[flight dispatcher]]s, giving everyone a shared awareness for faster reactions to changing circumstances, such as approaching thunderstorms.\n\nData Comm saves aircraft time waiting to take off, particularly when routes change, which reduces fuel use and engine exhaust emissions. It lowers the chances of delays or cancellations when weather affects the flight route. Pilots and controllers also can spend more time on other critical tasks, which enhances safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/general-news/20160624/lax-unveils-data-comm-aircraft-texting-system-designed-to-reduce-flight-delays|title=LAX unveils Data Comm aircraft texting system designed to reduce flight delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kutv.com/news/local/new-data-comm-reduces-wait-time-on-slc-runways|title=New Data Comm system reduces wait time on SLC runways|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/37d10b72c9b8402099c602afc0391f44/Pilots,-air-traffic-controllers-shifting-to-text-messaging|title=Pilots, air traffic controllers shifting to text messaging|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119235508/https://www.apnews.com/37d10b72c9b8402099c602afc0391f44/Pilots,-air-traffic-controllers-shifting-to-text-messaging|archive-date=2018-01-19|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-ohare-pilot-texting-0930-biz-20160929-story.html|title=Pilots to start texting at O'Hare, Midway \u2014 but it's not what you think|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/faa-shows-off-new-air-traffic-communications-at-msp/419214164/|title=\"FAA shows off new air-traffic communications at Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-flights-benefiting-from-new-text-based-tech-faa-says-1.13276922|title=NYC flights benefiting from new text-based tech, FAA says|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/pilot-text-messages-are-saving-you-from-flight-delays/|title=Pilot text messages are saving you from flight delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2016-09-28/faa-accelerates-data-communications-roll-out-atc-towers|title=FAA Accelerates Data Communications Roll Out to ATC Towers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/27/airlines-flight-controllers-data-communications/91177576/|title=Less chat, more action for airlines, flight controllers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://crankyflier.com/2016/06/28/a-demo-on-how-data-comm-is-going-to-make-flying-better/|title=A Demo On How Data Comm Is Going to Make Flying Better|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/new-direct-digital-link-between-tower-and-cockpit-will-speed-planes-on-their-way/2016/09/27/50eb9ec8-843b-11e6-a3ef-f35afb41797f_story.html|title=New direct digital link between tower and cockpit will speed planes on their way|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBased on Data Comm's success, air carriers requested and the FAA approved in 2017 seven more airports to receive tower services to be completed by 2019.

More types of air traffic controller messages will be available, including the ability to reroute multiple aircraft. Initial Data Comm services for high-altitude flight started in November 2019 at the Kansas City and Indianapolis air route traffic control centers and are scheduled to be in place at all 20 centers across the country by 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aviationtoday.com/2019/11/13/delayed-delivery-en-route-cpdlc-messages-fixed-faa-says/|title=Delayed Delivery of En-route CPDLC Messages Fixed, FAA Says|last=|first=|date=November 13, 2019|website=Avionics International|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nVoice exchanges will always be part of air traffic control. In critical situations, they continue to be the primary form of controller-pilot interaction. For routine communications between pilots and controllers, Data Comm will increase efficiency and airspace capacity. Data Comm is expected to save operators more than $10 billion over the 30-year life cycle of the program and the FAA about $1 billion in future operating costs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/data_comm/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Data Communications|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313110025/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/data_comm/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Navigation ===\n[[Performance-based navigation|Performance Based Navigation]] (PBN) is an [[instrument flight rules]]<nowiki/> way of moving through airspace that varies depending equipage, navigational aids, and pilot training. Performance standards for certain airspace are conveyed to pilots through navigation specifications published by the FAA that identify the aircraft avionics and choice of ground- or satellite-based navigation aids that may be used to meet performance requirements.\n\nPBN comprises [[area navigation]] (RNAV) and [[required navigation performance]] (RNP). With RNAV, equipped aircraft fly any desired path within the coverage of ground- or space-based navigation aids, within the capability of aircraft equipage, or both. RNP is an advanced form of RNAV. Aircraft must be equipped to monitor onboard navigation performance and alert pilots trained to use it if a requirement is unmet during an operation. Aircraft can operate safely near mountainous terrain or in congested airspace by using RNP procedures.\n\nPBN primarily uses satellite-enabled technology and creates precise, repeatable, and predictable 3-D flight paths free from the constraints previously imposed by the physical locations of ground-based navigation infrastructure.

Aircraft flying in most controlled airspace are required to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020. Instead of using ground-based radar to receive aircraft position, speed, and direction every five to 12 seconds, aircraft equipped with newer [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] transponders determine this information and then automatically send it out every second to air traffic control. ADS-B is always on and requires no operator intervention. It depends on an accurate satellite signal for position data, enhances surveillance services, and continuously broadcasts aircraft position and other data to ground stations and aircraft equipped to receive ADS-B. Pilots and air traffic controllers can for the first time see the same real-time display of air traffic, which substantially improves situational awareness for improved safety.\n\nThe FAA completed installation of new ground radio infrastructure in 2014, and coverage is available in all 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Gulf of Mexico, and area off both coasts.

This platform offers a single point of access for more than 100 products, categorized into aeronautical, flight and traffic flow, and weather data. Producers can publish data once, and approved consumers can access needed information through a single connection, an improvement over the legacy way of connecting two systems with fixed network connections and custom point-to-point application-level data interfaces. The new format supports collaboration within domestic and international aviation communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2015/10/09/evaluating-future-global-swim-implementation/|title=Evaluating Future Global SWIM Implementation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the SWIM program completed its first segment, which established a common infrastructure and connection points at all en route traffic control centers. The program's second segment in 2016 established a service-oriented architecture \u2014 composed of producers, consumers, and a registry \u2014 and connected National Airspace System (NAS) programs, such as the Traffic Flow Management System, to provide large data sources for consumers. Several enhancements are being added, including improved security, and SWIM continues to add NAS air traffic management content providers and consumers.\n\nAs of October 2017, 10 NAS programs and six external organizations produce data sent via the SWIM network. A total of 180 consumers can access the data, with another 100 potential consumers in various stages of becoming SWIM consumers.

The NWP program will establish a common weather processing platform to replace the legacy FAA weather processor systems and supply new capabilities. The fully automated NWP will identify safety hazards around airports and in cruising altitude airspace. It will support strategic traffic flow management, including the translated weather information needed to predict route blockage and airspace capacity constraints up to eight hours in advance. NWP will use advanced algorithms to create current and predicted aviation-specific weather information with data from the FAA and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA)<nowiki/> radar and sensors, and NOAA forecast models. Part of the NWP, the Aviation Weather Display consolidates the current Weather and Radar Processor, Integrated Terminal Weather System, and the Corridor Integrated Weather System displays. The Aviation Weather Display will provide consistent weather information at a glance for en route and terminal controllers, and includes NWP and NOAA weather products.\n\nCSS-Wx will be the single producer of weather data, products, and imagery within the NAS, using standards-based weather dissemination via SWIM. It will consolidate and enable the decommissioning of legacy weather dissemination systems. It also offers NWP and NOAA weather products, and other weather sources for integration into air traffic decision support systems, improving the quality of traffic management decisions and enhancing controller productivity during severe weather. CSS-Wx information consumers will include air traffic controllers and managers, commercial and general aviation operators, and the flying public.\n\nThe FAA's Weather Technology in the Cockpit team of researchers are experts on the pitfalls of how weather is displayed in [[general aviation]] cockpits.

The FAA Office of Environment and Energy Research and Development is working to reduce air and water pollution, carbon dioxide emissions that may affect climate, and noise that can disturb residents near airports. Aircraft airframe and engine technology, alternative fuels, air traffic management modernization and operational improvements, improved scientific knowledge and integrated modeling, and policies, environmental standards, and market-based measures will contribute toward meeting almost all of these goals. Noise and emissions will be the main environmental problems on National Airspace System capacity and flexibility unless they are effectively managed and mitigated. \n\nSince the late 1970s, the number of people exposed to significant aircraft noise dropped by more than 95 percent while operations more than doubled. Even with this decrease, community concern regarding aircraft noise is climbing. The FAA aims to minimize the impact of noise on residential areas without compromising safety. The agency's goal is to reduce the number of people around airports exposed to a day-night average aircraft sound level of 65 decibels to less than 300,000 by 2018. One way the agency plans to achieve that is by adopting a new noise standard for certain newly certificated subsonic jet airplanes and subsonic transport category large airplanes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|title=NextGen Update: 2017 Environment and Energy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313094224/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA survey, the largest of its kind, about aircraft noise exposure and its effects on communities around airports was completed in 2016.

In addition, the FAA is conducting research in other impact areas, such as sleep disturbance, cardiovascular health, and children's learning. The FAA also is examining the potential noise impacts of new entrants, such as unmanned aircraft systems, civil supersonic aircraft, and commercial space vehicles.\n\nThe Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise (CLEEN) program is a public-private partnership under NextGen to accelerate development and commercial deployment of more-efficient technologies and sustainable alternative fuels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|title=Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise Program|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101000308/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|archive-date=2011-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first five-year agreement with manufacturers produced jet engine, wing, and aerodynamic technologies; automation and flight management systems; fuels; and materials from 2010\u20132015.

In 2016, the United States and 22 countries reached an agreement on a first-ever global aircraft carbon dioxide standard to encourage more fuel-efficient technologies to be integrated into aircraft designs. Also in 2016, the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection recommended a new environmental measure of non-volatile particulate matter emissions. It replaces the 1970s-era \u201csmoke number\u201d \u2014 a figure that describes the visibility of emissions \u2014 with a much more accurate measure of emissions particles.\n\n=== Safety ===\nThe FAA's safety program is guided by its [[Safety management systems|Safety Management System]] <nowiki/>\u2014 an agency-wide approach that directs the management of NextGen initiatives. NextGen capabilities\u2019 benefits must maintain safe operations in the National Airspace System (NAS), and the FAA has many processes to ensure that flying remains safe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|title=NextGen portfolio System Safety Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502095913/https://www.faa.gov/NextGen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|archive-date=2017-05-02|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Safety|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312155111/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|archive-date=2015-03-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe interconnected nature of NextGen presents complicated safety challenges that call for an integrated approach to safety [[risk management]]<nowiki/>. Integrated safety risk management explores safety risk from a NAS enterprise framework to identify potential safety gaps inherent in NextGen capabilities. It identifies safety issues by assessing risk across organizational, system, and program boundaries, and relies on FAA-wide collaboration to capture the most relevant safety information to assist in decision-making.\n\nAviation watchdogs once measured safety by the number of accidents. Commercial aviation accidents eventually became so rare that the FAA began to measure potential precursors to accidents. Loss of a safe margin of separation between aircraft became the risk measure that the FAA tracked and reported. Proximity is a valid indicator, but is an incomplete picture and provides no insight into accidents\u2019 causal factors. System Safety Management is a NextGen portfolio of initiatives to develop and implement policies, processes, and analytical tools that the FAA and industry will use to ensure the safety of the NAS. The goal is to be certain that changes introduced with NextGen capabilities maintain or enhance safety while delivering capacity and efficiency benefits to NAS users.\n\nImproved risk analysis processes and new safety intelligence tools help safety analysts go beyond examining past accident data to detecting risk and implementing mitigation strategies for accident prevention.

Due to the integrated nature of NextGen, many of its component systems are mutually dependent on one or more other systems. The FAA implements systems through segments that the stakeholder community agrees are useful and that balance costs and benefits. The FAA will have delivered initial implementation of all major planned systems by 2025 but not the full integration necessary to provide all anticipated NextGen benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=|title=Story of NextGen|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/CNOReport2017.pdf|title=2017 Chief NextGen Officer report}}</ref>\n\n=== New entrants ===\nThe demand for access to airspace by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and commercial spacecraft is evolving, and the FAA must accommodate changing needs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/americas-plan-somehow-make-drones-not-ruin-skies/|title=America's Plan to Somehow Make Drones Not Ruin the Skies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The FAA is pursuing ways to safely and efficiently integrate these new entrants into the National Airspace System (NAS) with minimal impact on other NAS users. This involves determining the required automation support, as well as the surveillance, communication, and navigation capabilities that account for the unique performance characteristics of UAS, and space launch and re-entry vehicles. Many NextGen technologies are expected to facilitate this integration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental impacts ===\nCommunities around airports are concerned about increased environmental problems, particularly noise. Nextgen has created a \"rail\" of flights, or a concentrated path of flights, in cities across the United States, and residents living under the \"rail\" are hearing more aircraft noise. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@bcastleton/nextgen-and-noise-pollution-the-faas-carte-blanche-to-send-planes-screaming-over-our-houses-dad4f3d4d29d|title=NextGen Nextgen and Noise Pollution the FAAs Carte Blanche to Send Planes Screaming Over Our Houses|archive-url=https://medium.com/@bcastleton/nextgen-and-noise-pollution-the-faas-carte-blanche-to-send-planes-screaming-over-our-houses-dad4f3d4d29d|archive-date=2018-01-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> Congress set up a coalition to study the noise issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nqsc.org/Organizations.html|title=National Quiet Skies Coalition|archive-url=https://nqsc.org/Organizations.html|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> A [[Government Accountability Office]] report on environmental impacts at airports indicated that the changes in flight paths that will accompany NextGen efforts would affect some communities that were previously unaffected or minimally affected by aircraft noise and expose them to increased noise levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-50|title=Aviation and the Environment: Systematically Addressing Environmental Impacts and Community Concerns Can Help Airports Reduce Project Delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> These levels could trigger the need for environmental reviews, as well as raise community concerns. The report found that addressing environmental impacts can delay the implementation of operational changes, and indicated that a systematic approach to addressing these impacts and the resulting community concerns may help reduce such delays. \n\nThrough its environment and energy strategy, the FAA is maturing new aircraft technologies, removing the barriers to sustainable alternative jet fuels, developing new operational procedures, advancing analytical capabilities, and implementing policies, standards, and measures to reduce noise and emissions, and improve energy efficiency.\n\nRegarding noise, the FAA has renewed its focus to provide information to the community and solicit aviation user and citizen input when developing procedures. This helps the FAA ensure that proposed airspace and route adjustments consider aviation system safety and efficiency as well as community impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-aviation-faa-noise-idUKKBN0NT1VQ20150508|title=FAA plans major study of U.S. airport noise|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110122305/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|archive-date=2012-01-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nThe FAA has traditionally followed the National Environmental Protection Act process when designing and implementing procedures. However, in recent years, more community involvement is necessary, especially when flight paths are being changed due to Performance Based Navigation implementations. The FAA has increased its public engagement efforts to educate communities about how the agency develops procedures and measures noise, and to listen to residents\u2019 concerns. The FAA has been working closely with airports, airlines, and community officials to determine how the agency can best balance the FAA's pursuit of safer, more efficient flight paths with the needs of nearby communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|title=ATCA Conference Keynote Address|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101231905/http://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|archive-date=2016-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> This new approach to community involvement does not guarantee outcomes that satisfy everyone.

Dixon, principal assistant inspector general for auditing and evaluation, the FAA's major acquisitions since the creation of the [[Air Traffic Organization]] continue to experience performance issues. Six programs experienced cost increases totaling $692 million and schedule delays averaging 25 months. The FAA's implementation of this approach has led to unclear and inconsistent reporting on overall program costs, schedules, and benefits. Notwithstanding reforms, several underlying and systemic issues \u2014 including overambitious plans, shifting requirements, software development problems, ineffective contract and program management, and unreliable cost and schedule estimates \u2014 affect the FAA's ability to introduce new technologies and capabilities that are critical to transitioning to NextGen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reason.org/news/show/1014429.html/|title=Inspector General Report Shows FAA Is Failing and Why a Non-Profit Should Manage Air Traffic Control|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oig.dot.gov/library-item/32908|title=FAA Reforms Have Not Achieved Expected Cost, Efficiency, and Modernization Outcomes|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDuring a meeting with air carrier CEOs shortly after taking office, [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]] claimed that the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] spent more than $7 billion to upgrade the system and \u201ctotally failed.\u201d However, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a speech that NextGen has already provided $2.7 billion in benefits, and is on track to provide more than $157 billion more by 2030.

The National Research Council's 2015 \u201cReview of the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d report explains that NextGen needs an explicit system architecture \u2014 in addition to its existing enterprise architecture  \u2014 to guide its development, manage risk, and cope with change. To create this architecture, FAA should build an architecture community and also strengthen its work force in several technical fields. The report also examines the incorporation of cybersecurity, unmanned aircraft systems, and human factors into the NextGen architecture. Finally, the report considers NextGen's anticipated costs and benefits, noting that airlines are not motivated to spend money on NextGen because they receive few direct benefits and face schedule uncertainty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=21721|title=FAA Should 'Reset Expectations' for Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Noise ===\nMore precise PBN can reduce fuel burn, emissions, and noise exposure for a majority of communities, but the concentration of flight tracks also can increase noise exposure for people who live directly under those flight paths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jdasolutions.aero/blog/nextgen-noise-study/|title=NextGen Noise: RNP\u2019s concentrated IMPACT may justify substantive change in FAA policies under a proper study|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://atwonline.com/air-traffic-management/faa-facing-backlash-over-noise-issues-created-pbn-flight-paths|title=FAA facing backlash over noise issues created by PBN flight paths|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021124915/http://atwonline.com/air-traffic-management/faa-facing-backlash-over-noise-issues-created-pbn-flight-paths|archive-date=2016-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/advances-in-airport-technology-mean-sleepless-nights-for-some/2016/03/04/7b8eb936-e098-11e5-9c36-e1902f6b6571_story.html|title=Advances in airport technology mean sleepless nights for some|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aireform.com/a-closer-look-at-how-faa-is-tone-deaf-on-nextgen-noise-impacts/|title=A Closer Look at How FAA is \u2018Tone-Deaf\u2019 on NextGen Noise Impacts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospectparkquietskies.org/Maurice_Implications_Enviro_NextGen.pdf|title=Implications of Administration Environmental Requirements for NextGen|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> A feature of the NextGen program is GPS-based waypoints, which result in consolidated flight paths for planes.

Two years later, the Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry recommended that a multi-agency task force develop an integrated plan to transform the U.S. air transportation system. In 2003, Congress enacted the Vision 100 \u2013 Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, which established the [[Joint Planning and Development Office]] (JPDO) to create a unified vision of what the U.S. air transportation system should deliver for the next generation and beyond, to develop and coordinate long-term research plans, and to sponsor cross-agency mission research.\n\nThe result of the JPDO's efforts was the creation of the \u201cIntegrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tg.hfes.org/astg/papers/Natl_Plan_NGATS_v5.pdf|title=Integrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which defined high-level goals, objectives, and requirements to transform the air transportation system. In addition to the Department of Transportation and FAA, the plan involved other government agencies with responsibilities in air transportation services, including the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), [[National Weather Service]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and [[Transportation Security Administration]].\n\nThe JPDO released the \u201cConcept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|title=Concept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012213821/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|archive-date=2015-10-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> to the aviation stakeholder community in 2007. The concept of operations provided the overview of NextGen goals for 2025. Growth of the NextGen concept was an evolutionary, step-by-step process, and the JPDO document continued to be updated through 2011. The same year, the FAA published the first version of its expanded Operational Evolution Partnership,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nextor.org/Conferences/200709_NAS_Performance/0905_2b_Swennson%20-%20OEP.pdf|title=Operational Evolution Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which outlined the agency's path to NextGen through 2025.\n\nThe original integrated national plan included airport surface and passenger terminal operations and was known as a \u201ccurb-to-curb\u201d solution. The concept of operations was intended to drive cross-agency research to validate the concepts and to eliminate ideas and alternatives that were not operationally feasible or beneficial. The FAA focused on the pieces of the air transportation system for which it was responsible \u2013 the \u201cgate-to-gate\u201d components. In 2011, the FAA published the report \u201cNextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations for the National Airspace System\u201d. The FAA concept of operations was consistent with the JPDO's broad set of objectives, including maintaining safety and security, increasing capacity and efficiency, ensuring access to airspace and airports, and mitigating environmental impacts. The report identified several key transformational concepts as necessary to achieve NextGen goals and objectives, such as precision navigation and network-enabled information access, and the FAA has made progress on them.\n\nChanges were underway in 2008 when the FAA started to move key parts of NextGen, such as [[Automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast|Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast]] (ADS-B), from design to delivery. NextGen progress involved expanded research and development capability, participation by the aviation industry and international partners, and support by the White House and Congress (which are highlighted in this section).\n\nThe agency established a research and development facility, known as a testbed, at [[Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University|Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], Florida, in 2008. In 2010, the FAA dedicated another testbed, the NextGen Integration and Evaluation Capability Laboratory at the [[William J. Hughes Technical Center]] in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for researchers to simulate and evaluate the effects of NextGen components on the NAS. The lab's capability grew in 2013 with a contract awarded to [[General Dynamics]] to provide engineering, software design and development, infrastructure, and administrative support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.generaldynamics.com/news/press-releases/2013/03/general-dynamics-awarded-12-million-support-federal-aviation|title=General Dynamics Awarded $12 Million to Support Federal Aviation Administration System Engineering 2020 Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the FAA signed agreements with [[Honeywell]] and ACSS to accelerate testing and installation of NextGen technology to detect and alert pilots of safety hazards on the airport surface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2008/11/03/faa-signs-contract-with-honeywell-acss/|title=FAA Signs Contract with Honeywell, ACSS|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> [[NetJets]] also agreed to equip part of its fleet to test some programs in various areas of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netjets.com/News/2015/faa-partners-with-netjets-on-implementing-nextgen-technologies--/|title=FAA Partners With NetJets on Implementing NextGen Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> By 2010, the FAA awarded [[Computer Support Services]] Inc. a $280 million contract to perform engineering work for NextGen, the first of six contracts that would be awarded under an umbrella portfolio contract. [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], and [[ITT Inc.|ITT Corp.]] received FAA contracts worth up to $4.4 billion to conduct large-scale demonstrations to see how NextGen concepts, procedures, and technologies could be integrated into the current NAS. In 2012, the FAA selected [[Harris Corporation|Harris Corp.]], which then subcontracted [[Dataprobe]], to develop the [[National Airspace System Voice Switch|NAS Voice System]] and manage a $331 million Data Communications Integrated Services contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/09/harris-corporation-awarded-331-million-contract-by-faa-for-data/|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $331 Million Contract by FAA for Data Communications Integrated Services Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/08/harris-corporation-awarded-291-million-contract-to-provide-federal-aviation|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $291 Million Contract to Provide Federal Aviation Administration's New National Air Traffic Control Communications System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nCommercial airlines also became involved in NextGen. In 2011, the FAA signed an agreement with [[JetBlue]] to allow the carrier to fly select flights equipped with ADS-B, opening the airline to improved routing and giving the FAA NextGen data through real-time operational evaluations. [[United Airlines]] in 2013 announced plans to become the first carrier to equip a portion of its fleet with avionics necessary for [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] (Data Comm) under the FAA NextGen Data Comm avionics equipage program. The program was funded to equip 1,900 aircraft across the industry to ensure enough aircraft would participate in Data Comm.\n\nTo develop industry consensus for the FAA's midterm goals, the agency established a new task force carried out through [[RTCA, Incorporated|RTCA]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|title=NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force Report Sept. 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812102308/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAA wanted the task force to examine how industry could contribute to and benefit from the NextGen effort; accordingly, the agency released a plan in 2010 on how to implement recommendations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|title=FAA Response to Recommendations of the RTCA NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824192936/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe NextGen Advisory Committee (NAC),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>  established in 2010 to address the task force recommendation to continue industry collaboration, is a federal advisory group comprising aviation stakeholders formed to provide advice on policy-level NextGen implementation issues facing the aviation community. The FAA and NAC in 2014 agreed on the NextGen Priorities Joint Implementation Plan to accelerate delivery of four core NextGen initiatives over three years to improve efficiency: optimizing airports with multiple runways (e.g. via simultaneous parallel landings with reduced separation), increasing the efficiency of surface operations, reconfiguring the navigation system from ground-based to primarily satellite-based, and improving communications between aircraft and the ground through a digital system.\n\nThe FAA seeks to ensure international [[air traffic management]] interoperability and system harmonization for improved safety and efficiency. In 2010, the FAA and the European Commission agreed to cooperate in 22 areas to help in joint research and development of NextGen and [[Single European Sky ATM Research]] (SESAR) projects. By 2012, the FAA and the A6 alliance of European air navigation service providers agreed to work toward an interoperable aviation system, and work together to deploy and implement NextGen and SESAR.\n\nExecutive Order 13479, Transformation of the National Air Transportation System,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=84969|title=Executive Order 13479\u2014Transformation of the National Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> signed in 2008 mandated the Secretary of Transportation to establish a NextGen support staff. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/plans_reports/modernization/|title=FAA Modernization and Reform Act (P.L. 112-095) Reports and Plans|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811143229/http://www.faa.gov/about/plans_reports/modernization/|archive-date=2014-08-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> included establishing deadlines for adopting existing NextGen navigation and surveillance technology and mandated development of precision navigational procedures at the nation's 35 busiest airports by 2015.\n\nIn 2010, the FAA's Aviation Safety organization released a work plan that identified how the safety staff would set NextGen standards and oversee safe implementation of new technologies, processes, and procedures. The FAA also issued a final rule mandating NextGen performance requirements for aircraft surveillance equipment. It requires aircraft operating in most controlled U.S. airspace to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020.\n\n==Justification==\nA Department of Transportation 30-year outlook report published in 2016, \u201cBeyond Traffic: Trends and Choices 2045,\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transportation.gov/policy-initiatives/beyond-traffic-2045-final-report|title=Beyond Traffic: 2045 Final Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> estimated flight delays and congestion cost the U.S. economy more than $20 billion each year.

The agency worked with industry to identify capabilities taking advantage of existing aircraft equipage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> This strategy enabled airspace users to realize early benefits while keeping NextGen on course to achieve its long-term goal of time-based air traffic management.\n\nNext, the FAA started replacing its foundational infrastructure. Based on previous lessons learned, the agency determined the best way to upgrade its services was to begin with a new infrastructure that could accommodate state-of-the-art enabling technologies and advanced capabilities rather than adding one-off improvements to an aging infrastructure that couldn't accommodate broader transformation.\n\nFAA modernization programs, such as [[ERAM|En Route Automation Modernization]] (ERAM) and [[Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System|Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement]] (TAMR), are foundational pieces upon which the FAA could build the NextGen vision. These programs support NextGen objectives with modern software architectures that serve as the platform for new capabilities for air traffic controllers and managers.\n\nThe FAA uses a widely accepted model for building large-scale automation systems. Program lifecycles are continuous with a planned schedule of technology refreshes. For example, the FAA finished installing the original hardware for ERAM in 2008, and completed software and program acceptance in 2015. In 2016, the agency updated the technology of all major system components that were becoming obsolete. This is a common approach to maintain the latest level of technology.\n\nOn top of the foundational systems, the FAA then identified key enabling systems that improve communication, information sharing, navigation, surveillance, traffic flow optimization, and weather systems.\n\nChanges to the national airspace necessary to implement these individual concepts yield additional benefits. Integrating these systems is anticipated to transform the air traffic management system in an effort to keep pace with the growing needs of an increasingly diverse mix of air transportation system users without sacrificing safety.\n\nIntegration is necessary to achieve an FAA long-term goal of trajectory-based operations (TBO). TBO is a method of strategically planning and managing air traffic from airport to airport for optimal performance by using the aircraft's ability to fly precise paths; metering traffic flow using time instead of distance; and sharing information between pilots, flight dispatchers, and controllers and managers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ang/offices/tc/library/Storyboard/tbo.html#welcome|title=TBO Vision 2025 Storyboard|date=October 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith TBO, the FAA and operators will be able to tell with a great deal of accuracy where aircraft will be at any point in time along the way to its destination. This will provide improved knowledge of the estimated departure and arrival time at each navigational waypoint along the entire route of flight. These times will be shared between air and ground automation systems and used to improve assessments of how to balance demand and capacity, and minimize the impact of disruptions due to weather, or system or facility outages. NextGen benefits extend to all phases of flight operations.\n\nBecause NextGen is a complex, large-scale system of systems implemented over more than 18 years, its development and implementation can be difficult to follow. Systems are always in various stages of lifecycle management from research and development to technical refreshes. FAA planning reports are used to map the evolution from the legacy National Airspace System (NAS) to NextGen. To manage NextGen with short-term funding horizons, the FAA rolled out improvements in smaller increments with more program segments to ensure affordability.\n\nThe FAA has scheduled initial implementation of all major planned systems by 2025 but not the full integration necessary to provide the complete set of anticipated NextGen benefits. Beyond 2025, the FAA expects to accrue benefits through enterprise-level advanced applications, additional aircraft equipage, and full workforce adoption of a time-based air traffic management system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe FAA is using knowledge gained since 2011 when it published the NextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations. Working closely with stakeholders, the FAA invested in research and pre-implementation work to determine the feasibility of advanced concepts and their associated benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The aviation community understood that many, but not all, of the concepts would produce positive business cases once research and pre-implementation work was under way, and that some goals would be replaced by other concepts in an evolving aviation environment.

The FAA is making progress in transforming the NAS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2016-10-24/faa-declares-steady-progress-nextgen-atc-modernization|title=FAA Declares Steady Progress on NextGen ATC Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2017-02-15/faas-nextgen-making-progress-airline-pilots-union-asserts|title=FAA's NextGen Making Progress, Airline Pilots Union Asserts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2017/03/02/faa-ready-review-us-air-traffic-modernization/|title=FAA Ready to Review US Air Traffic Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2015/10/23/datacomm-eram-ads-b-huerta-touts-nextgen-milestones/|title=DataComm, ERAM, ADS-B: Huerta Touts NextGen Milestones|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSix concepts that posed too high a technical risk, for instance those with no available technical solution, have been deferred beyond 2030.

It is not one technology, product, or goal; but rather, it encompasses many technologies and procedures that are being developed and implemented after thorough safety testing. It is composed of many elements that provide benefits individually and collectively to transform the air transportation system.\n\n=== Communication ===\nController Pilot Data Link Communications, also known as [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] or just Data Comm, uses typed digital messages to supplement voice communications between air traffic controllers and pilots. The first part of the program for 55 airports, tower departure clearance services, finished in 2016 more than two years ahead of schedule. It is helping equipped aircraft take off sooner through messages quickly exchanged and clearly understood.\n\nUnlike voice messages, Data Comm messages sent by controllers are delivered only to the intended aircraft, which eliminates the chance of another pilot acting on instructions for another aircraft with a similar call sign. It avoids the chance of misunderstood messages because of busy radio chatter or variations in the way people speak, and it can be a backup if a microphone malfunctions. It also preserves radio bandwidth when voice communication is necessary or preferred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/issue/cover/88451.html?hq_e=el&hq_m=3280857&hq_l=2&hq_v=702ed8c35e|title=NextGen Data Comm Facilitates Digital DCL|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUsing Data Comm, tower air traffic controllers can send pilots of equipped aircraft departure clearance instructions to read, accept, and load into their flight management system with the push of a button. Messages also are sent to [[flight dispatcher]]s, giving everyone a shared awareness for faster reactions to changing circumstances, such as approaching thunderstorms.\n\nData Comm saves aircraft time waiting to take off, particularly when routes change, which reduces fuel use and engine exhaust emissions. It lowers the chances of delays or cancellations when weather affects the flight route.

Performance standards for certain airspace are conveyed to pilots through navigation specifications published by the FAA that identify the aircraft avionics and choice of ground- or satellite-based navigation aids that may be used to meet performance requirements.\n\nPBN comprises [[area navigation]] (RNAV) and [[required navigation performance]] (RNP). With RNAV, equipped aircraft fly any desired path within the coverage of ground- or space-based navigation aids, within the capability of aircraft equipage, or both. RNP is an advanced form of RNAV. Aircraft must be equipped to monitor onboard navigation performance and alert pilots trained to use it if a requirement is unmet during an operation. Aircraft can operate safely near mountainous terrain or in congested airspace by using RNP procedures.\n\nPBN primarily uses satellite-enabled technology and creates precise, repeatable, and predictable 3-D flight paths free from the constraints previously imposed by the physical locations of ground-based navigation infrastructure. A new route structure makes straighter paths possible for greater efficiency, and more routes can fit into the same airspace, which increases capacity. From 2009\u20132016, PBN procedures available nearly tripled at airports across the nation. As of December 2019, the FAA has published more than 9,600 PBN procedures and routes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Performance Based Navigation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313085529/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/procedures/ifp_inventory_summary/|title=Instrument Flight Procedures (IFP) Inventory Summary|last=|first=|date=December 11, 2019|website=Federal Aviation Administration|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These consist of RNAV [[standard instrument departure]]s, T-Routes (1,200 feet above the surface to 18,000 feet of altitude), Q-Routes (18,000\u201345,000 feet of altitude), RNAV [[Standard terminal arrival route|standard terminal arrivals]] (STAR), RNAV (GPS) approaches, and RNP approaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Performance Based Navigation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313085529/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> Of the airports that publish [[instrument approach]] procedures, 96 percent publish PBN approach procedures and 31 percent use only PBN approach procedures.\n\nRNAV STAR procedures can provide a [[continuous descent approach]] also known as an optimized profile descent from cruising altitude to save fuel and reduce emissions and noise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/houston-nextgen-plane-descents/|title=Planes Are Finally Making Logical Descents Onto American Runways|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The FAA has published many RNAV STAR procedures with this capability that enable aircraft to fly closer to the airport at a more fuel-efficient altitude before descending, which also saves fuel by eliminating level-offs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=62|title=New Analysis Shows Big Benefits at Minneapolis International Airport|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628094052/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=62|archive-date=2017-06-28|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=43|title=Changes to Houston\u2019s Airspace Bring Millions in Benefits to Local Airports|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201103647/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=43|archive-date=2016-02-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> These procedures can be flown when available and when pilots are able to use them.\n\nUsing the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]]<nowiki/>, instrument-rated pilots now can land at airports where that was previously impossible using just [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]<nowiki/>.

Aircraft flying in most controlled airspace are required to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020. Instead of using ground-based radar to receive aircraft position, speed, and direction every five to 12 seconds, aircraft equipped with newer [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] transponders determine this information and then automatically send it out every second to air traffic control. ADS-B is always on and requires no operator intervention. It depends on an accurate satellite signal for position data, enhances surveillance services, and continuously broadcasts aircraft position and other data to ground stations and aircraft equipped to receive ADS-B. Pilots and air traffic controllers can for the first time see the same real-time display of air traffic, which substantially improves situational awareness for improved safety.\n\nThe FAA completed installation of new ground radio infrastructure in 2014, and coverage is available in all 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Gulf of Mexico, and area off both coasts. Integration of ADS-B into en route and terminal automation platforms was completed in 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=94678|title=FAA Successfully Completes Final ADS-B Milestone|last=|first=|date=October 7, 2019|work=FAA News and Updates|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe FAA is evaluating space-based ADS-B surveillance services for oceanic airspace as part of a project called Advanced Surveillance Enhanced Procedural Separation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/faa-takes-steps-toward-space-based-ads-b-track-aircraft|title=FAA Takes Steps Toward Space-Based ADS-B To Track Aircraft|last=|first=|date=December 12, 2019|work=Aviation Week|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Moving from the current system of ADS-B ground stations to radios hosted on satellites offers the potential for reduced separation standards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/telecom/2017/04/27/faa-aireon-announce-space-based-ads-b-flight-test-success/|title=FAA and Aireon Announce Space-Based ADS-B Flight Test Success|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2017-05-15/faa-nav-canada-and-aireon-test-space-based-ads-b|title=FAA, Nav Canada and Aireon Test Space-based ADS-B|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.getconnected.aero/2017/04/faa-aireon-next-gen-ads-b/|title=FAA and Aireon announce next-gen ADS-B test success|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Even with the capabilities offered by ADS-B through satellite technology, surveillance radar is still relevant and will be used as a supplement and ultimately as backup to ADS-B in the event of service disruption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/global-advance-ads-b|title=Global Advance Of ADS-B|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926145530/http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/global-advance-ads-b|archive-date=2016-09-26}}</ref>\n\n==== ADS-B Out ====\nWith ADS-B Out, surveillance coverage increases because ground stations can be provided in locations where obstructions or physical limitations don't allow radar.

They help to achieve NextGen goals of safely increasing access, efficiency, and throughput at many airports when low visibility is the limiting factor. [[Head-up display]]s (HUD) <nowiki/>were approved to use on a precision approach to lower minimum decision heights to land. Use of a qualified HUD when flying to a suitable [[Instrument landing system|Instrument Landing System]]<nowiki/> facility will reduce the required runway visual range visibility for approach.\n\nThe FAA allows the use of an [[enhanced flight vision system]] (EFVS)<nowiki/> instead of natural vision to conduct an instrument landing procedure in low-visibility conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/new-faa-rules-let-technology-replace-natural-vision|title=New FAA Rules Let Technology Replace Natural Vision|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111151324/http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/new-faa-rules-let-technology-replace-natural-vision|archive-date=2017-01-11|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/FAA-Expands-Enhanced-Vision-Capabilities-228201-1.html|title=FAA Expands Enhanced Vision Capabilities|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> EFVS uses sensor technologies to provide a clear, real-time virtual image to the pilot of the view outside the aircraft, regardless of the cloud cover and visibility conditions. Pilots can identify required visual references that would be impossible without it. It provides access that otherwise would be denied because of low visibility. A [[Synthetic vision system|synthetic vision guidance system]]<nowiki/> combines flight guidance display technology with high-precision position assurance monitors to provide a continuous and correct depiction of the external scene and runway. It can assist a pilot's transition to natural vision references. A project also is under way to enable taxiing at airports in low-visibility conditions.\n\nAnother NextGen project is the Ground Based Augmentation System Landing System (GBAS). It uses GPS to support all precision-approach categories. Newark and Houston operate non-federal GBAS systems approved for operations to as low as 200 feet above the runway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/delivering/oiaa/investments/|title=NextGen Operator Investments|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502100203/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/delivering/oiaa/investments/|archive-date=2017-05-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter a reduction of minimum visual runway range requirements, an FAA assessment showed airport access during low-visibility conditions improved in two ways: almost 6 percent fewer periods of time with no access and 17 percent more flights could land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/NGPA_2015.pdf|title=NextGen Operational Performance Assessment September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429034552/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/NGPA_2015.pdf|archive-date=2016-04-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nInitial tailored arrivals are available for certain aircraft flying into San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Miami. These arrivals are planned, fixed routes for aircraft approaching these airports from oceanic airspace that are communicated via a data link from the air traffic controller. They limit vectoring and minimize the time the aircraft spends maintaining level flight during descent, which reduces fuel consumption, aircraft exhaust emissions, and time in flight. These differ from Performance Based Navigation's optimized profile descents because they are tailored to the characteristics of a limited number of aircraft types equipped with the [[Future Air Navigation System]].<nowiki/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/BusinessCaseForNextGen-2016.pdf|title=2016 Update to The Business Case for the Next Generation Air Transportation System based on the Future of the NAS Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804121920/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/BusinessCaseForNextGen-2016.pdf|archive-date=2016-08-04|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cms.dot.gov/content/benefits-next-generation-air-transportation-system|title=The Benefits of the Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2005/05/01/tailored-arrivals-idling-down-to-the-final-approach/|title=Tailored Arrivals: Idling Down to the Final Approach|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Airport Mapping ===\nThe FAA Office of Airports [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) <nowiki/>program provides data to manage aeronautical information and NextGen implementation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcwatch/0315/esri-solution-helps-airports-meet-new-faa-rules|title=Esri Solution Helps Airports Meet New FAA Rules|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> GIS identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural or constructed features or boundaries on the earth's surface.

The FAA Office of Environment and Energy Research and Development is working to reduce air and water pollution, carbon dioxide emissions that may affect climate, and noise that can disturb residents near airports. Aircraft airframe and engine technology, alternative fuels, air traffic management modernization and operational improvements, improved scientific knowledge and integrated modeling, and policies, environmental standards, and market-based measures will contribute toward meeting almost all of these goals. Noise and emissions will be the main environmental problems on National Airspace System capacity and flexibility unless they are effectively managed and mitigated. \n\nSince the late 1970s, the number of people exposed to significant aircraft noise dropped by more than 95 percent while operations more than doubled. Even with this decrease, community concern regarding aircraft noise is climbing. The FAA aims to minimize the impact of noise on residential areas without compromising safety. The agency's goal is to reduce the number of people around airports exposed to a day-night average aircraft sound level of 65 decibels to less than 300,000 by 2018. One way the agency plans to achieve that is by adopting a new noise standard for certain newly certificated subsonic jet airplanes and subsonic transport category large airplanes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|title=NextGen Update: 2017 Environment and Energy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313094224/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA survey, the largest of its kind, about aircraft noise exposure and its effects on communities around airports was completed in 2016. The FAA will use those results and other research under way to re-evaluate criteria to define significance under the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]<nowiki/> and federal land use guidelines. In addition, the FAA is conducting research in other impact areas, such as sleep disturbance, cardiovascular health, and children's learning. The FAA also is examining the potential noise impacts of new entrants, such as unmanned aircraft systems, civil supersonic aircraft, and commercial space vehicles.\n\nThe Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise (CLEEN) program is a public-private partnership under NextGen to accelerate development and commercial deployment of more-efficient technologies and sustainable alternative fuels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|title=Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise Program|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101000308/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|archive-date=2011-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first five-year agreement with manufacturers produced jet engine, wing, and aerodynamic technologies; automation and flight management systems; fuels; and materials from 2010\u20132015.

In 2016, the United States and 22 countries reached an agreement on a first-ever global aircraft carbon dioxide standard to encourage more fuel-efficient technologies to be integrated into aircraft designs. Also in 2016, the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection recommended a new environmental measure of non-volatile particulate matter emissions. It replaces the 1970s-era \u201csmoke number\u201d \u2014 a figure that describes the visibility of emissions \u2014 with a much more accurate measure of emissions particles.\n\n=== Safety ===\nThe FAA's safety program is guided by its [[Safety management systems|Safety Management System]] <nowiki/>\u2014 an agency-wide approach that directs the management of NextGen initiatives. NextGen capabilities\u2019 benefits must maintain safe operations in the National Airspace System (NAS), and the FAA has many processes to ensure that flying remains safe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|title=NextGen portfolio System Safety Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502095913/https://www.faa.gov/NextGen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|archive-date=2017-05-02|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Safety|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312155111/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|archive-date=2015-03-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe interconnected nature of NextGen presents complicated safety challenges that call for an integrated approach to safety [[risk management]]<nowiki/>. Integrated safety risk management explores safety risk from a NAS enterprise framework to identify potential safety gaps inherent in NextGen capabilities. It identifies safety issues by assessing risk across organizational, system, and program boundaries, and relies on FAA-wide collaboration to capture the most relevant safety information to assist in decision-making.\n\nAviation watchdogs once measured safety by the number of accidents. Commercial aviation accidents eventually became so rare that the FAA began to measure potential precursors to accidents. Loss of a safe margin of separation between aircraft became the risk measure that the FAA tracked and reported. Proximity is a valid indicator, but is an incomplete picture and provides no insight into accidents\u2019 causal factors. System Safety Management is a NextGen portfolio of initiatives to develop and implement policies, processes, and analytical tools that the FAA and industry will use to ensure the safety of the NAS. The goal is to be certain that changes introduced with NextGen capabilities maintain or enhance safety while delivering capacity and efficiency benefits to NAS users.\n\nImproved risk analysis processes and new safety intelligence tools help safety analysts go beyond examining past accident data to detecting risk and implementing mitigation strategies for accident prevention.

To maximize throughput, airlines and others have to agree that throughput and predictability are the primary metrics the FAA will use to judge the system's effectiveness. This could be different from, or even in some cases counter to, the traditional flight efficiency metrics used by airlines including reduced delay, reduced track miles, and reduced fuel burn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/CNOReport2017.pdf|title=2017 Chief NextGen Officer report}}</ref>\n\n=== Operational integration ===\nOperational integration of all air-ground capabilities is needed to achieve the full benefits of NextGen. Due to the integrated nature of NextGen, many of its component systems are mutually dependent on one or more other systems. The FAA implements systems through segments that the stakeholder community agrees are useful and that balance costs and benefits. The FAA will have delivered initial implementation of all major planned systems by 2025 but not the full integration necessary to provide all anticipated NextGen benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=|title=Story of NextGen|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/CNOReport2017.pdf|title=2017 Chief NextGen Officer report}}</ref>\n\n=== New entrants ===\nThe demand for access to airspace by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and commercial spacecraft is evolving, and the FAA must accommodate changing needs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/americas-plan-somehow-make-drones-not-ruin-skies/|title=America's Plan to Somehow Make Drones Not Ruin the Skies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The FAA is pursuing ways to safely and efficiently integrate these new entrants into the National Airspace System (NAS) with minimal impact on other NAS users. This involves determining the required automation support, as well as the surveillance, communication, and navigation capabilities that account for the unique performance characteristics of UAS, and space launch and re-entry vehicles. Many NextGen technologies are expected to facilitate this integration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental impacts ===\nCommunities around airports are concerned about increased environmental problems, particularly noise. Nextgen has created a \"rail\" of flights, or a concentrated path of flights, in cities across the United States, and residents living under the \"rail\" are hearing more aircraft noise. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@bcastleton/nextgen-and-noise-pollution-the-faas-carte-blanche-to-send-planes-screaming-over-our-houses-dad4f3d4d29d|title=NextGen Nextgen and Noise Pollution the FAAs Carte Blanche to Send Planes Screaming Over Our Houses|archive-url=https://medium.com/@bcastleton/nextgen-and-noise-pollution-the-faas-carte-blanche-to-send-planes-screaming-over-our-houses-dad4f3d4d29d|archive-date=2018-01-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> Congress set up a coalition to study the noise issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nqsc.org/Organizations.html|title=National Quiet Skies Coalition|archive-url=https://nqsc.org/Organizations.html|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> A [[Government Accountability Office]] report on environmental impacts at airports indicated that the changes in flight paths that will accompany NextGen efforts would affect some communities that were previously unaffected or minimally affected by aircraft noise and expose them to increased noise levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-50|title=Aviation and the Environment: Systematically Addressing Environmental Impacts and Community Concerns Can Help Airports Reduce Project Delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> These levels could trigger the need for environmental reviews, as well as raise community concerns. The report found that addressing environmental impacts can delay the implementation of operational changes, and indicated that a systematic approach to addressing these impacts and the resulting community concerns may help reduce such delays. \n\nThrough its environment and energy strategy, the FAA is maturing new aircraft technologies, removing the barriers to sustainable alternative jet fuels, developing new operational procedures, advancing analytical capabilities, and implementing policies, standards, and measures to reduce noise and emissions, and improve energy efficiency.\n\nRegarding noise, the FAA has renewed its focus to provide information to the community and solicit aviation user and citizen input when developing procedures. This helps the FAA ensure that proposed airspace and route adjustments consider aviation system safety and efficiency as well as community impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-aviation-faa-noise-idUKKBN0NT1VQ20150508|title=FAA plans major study of U.S. airport noise|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110122305/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|archive-date=2012-01-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nThe FAA has traditionally followed the National Environmental Protection Act process when designing and implementing procedures. However, in recent years, more community involvement is necessary, especially when flight paths are being changed due to Performance Based Navigation implementations. The FAA has increased its public engagement efforts to educate communities about how the agency develops procedures and measures noise, and to listen to residents\u2019 concerns. The FAA has been working closely with airports, airlines, and community officials to determine how the agency can best balance the FAA's pursuit of safer, more efficient flight paths with the needs of nearby communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|title=ATCA Conference Keynote Address|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101231905/http://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|archive-date=2016-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> This new approach to community involvement does not guarantee outcomes that satisfy everyone.

Dixon, principal assistant inspector general for auditing and evaluation, the FAA's major acquisitions since the creation of the [[Air Traffic Organization]] continue to experience performance issues. Six programs experienced cost increases totaling $692 million and schedule delays averaging 25 months. The FAA's implementation of this approach has led to unclear and inconsistent reporting on overall program costs, schedules, and benefits. Notwithstanding reforms, several underlying and systemic issues \u2014 including overambitious plans, shifting requirements, software development problems, ineffective contract and program management, and unreliable cost and schedule estimates \u2014 affect the FAA's ability to introduce new technologies and capabilities that are critical to transitioning to NextGen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reason.org/news/show/1014429.html/|title=Inspector General Report Shows FAA Is Failing and Why a Non-Profit Should Manage Air Traffic Control|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oig.dot.gov/library-item/32908|title=FAA Reforms Have Not Achieved Expected Cost, Efficiency, and Modernization Outcomes|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDuring a meeting with air carrier CEOs shortly after taking office, [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]] claimed that the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] spent more than $7 billion to upgrade the system and \u201ctotally failed.\u201d However, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a speech that NextGen has already provided $2.7 billion in benefits, and is on track to provide more than $157 billion more by 2030.

The National Research Council's 2015 \u201cReview of the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d report explains that NextGen needs an explicit system architecture \u2014 in addition to its existing enterprise architecture  \u2014 to guide its development, manage risk, and cope with change. To create this architecture, FAA should build an architecture community and also strengthen its work force in several technical fields. The report also examines the incorporation of cybersecurity, unmanned aircraft systems, and human factors into the NextGen architecture. Finally, the report considers NextGen's anticipated costs and benefits, noting that airlines are not motivated to spend money on NextGen because they receive few direct benefits and face schedule uncertainty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=21721|title=FAA Should 'Reset Expectations' for Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Noise ===\nMore precise PBN can reduce fuel burn, emissions, and noise exposure for a majority of communities, but the concentration of flight tracks also can increase noise exposure for people who live directly under those flight paths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jdasolutions.aero/blog/nextgen-noise-study/|title=NextGen Noise: RNP\u2019s concentrated IMPACT may justify substantive change in FAA policies under a proper study|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://atwonline.com/air-traffic-management/faa-facing-backlash-over-noise-issues-created-pbn-flight-paths|title=FAA facing backlash over noise issues created by PBN flight paths|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021124915/http://atwonline.com/air-traffic-management/faa-facing-backlash-over-noise-issues-created-pbn-flight-paths|archive-date=2016-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/advances-in-airport-technology-mean-sleepless-nights-for-some/2016/03/04/7b8eb936-e098-11e5-9c36-e1902f6b6571_story.html|title=Advances in airport technology mean sleepless nights for some|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aireform.com/a-closer-look-at-how-faa-is-tone-deaf-on-nextgen-noise-impacts/|title=A Closer Look at How FAA is \u2018Tone-Deaf\u2019 on NextGen Noise Impacts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospectparkquietskies.org/Maurice_Implications_Enviro_NextGen.pdf|title=Implications of Administration Environmental Requirements for NextGen|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> A feature of the NextGen program is GPS-based waypoints, which result in consolidated flight paths for planes.

The letter said the FAA initially described NextGen as fundamentally transforming how air traffic would be managed. In 2015, however, the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Research Council]] noted that NextGen, as currently executed, was not broadly transformational and that it is a set of programs to implement a suite of incremental changes to the National Airspace System (NAS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2017-05-17_-_full_committee_ssm.pdf|title=Committee Hearing on \"The Need to Reform FAA and Air Traffic Control to Build a 21st Century Aviation System for America\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://transportation.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=400893|title=Latest Inspector General Report Underscores Need for Air Traffic Control Reform|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of NextGen has led to a renewed push to reform air traffic control, supported by the Trump Administration, that would move this function from the government to a not-for-profit, independent entity managed by a professional board of directors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/05/president-donald-j-trumps-principles-reforming-us-air-traffic-control|title=President Donald J.
