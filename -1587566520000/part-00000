Muhammad preferred to use Shibam as the capital of his kingdom, rather than San'a. In 873 he received a diploma of confirmation from the Abbasid caliph.<ref>G.

A flood that inundated San'a in 876 served as the motive for Muhammad to undertake the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] and henceforth devote his time to religion. The reins of government were given to his son Ibrahim who murdered his father and uncle in the mosque of Shibam in 892 (or 882) to ensure that there would be no pretensions of power from that direction. The instigator of the murders was none but his own grandfather, the ex-ruler Yu'fir. Now, however, a series of revolts led to the expulsion of the Yufirids from San'a. An Abbasid governor took charge of the city for a while, but after 895 conditions turned increasingly chaotic.\n\n==Competition for San'a==\n\nAt the beginning of the tenth century there were struggles between the followers of the [[Zaydiyyah]] brand of Islam and other polities of the Yemeni highlands. The first Zaydi imam [[al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya]] temporarily took over San'a in 901 but was later forced to leave the city. In the same period Ibn Haushab and Ali bin al-Fadl disseminated the creed of the [[Fatimids]] among the highland tribes and acquired a great following. The two leaders are usually referred to as [[Qarmatians]] although they were actually appointed as ''da'is'' (leaders) by the Fatimid ruler.<ref>R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City'', London 1983, p. 56.</ref> They were able to conquer San'a in 905, and limit the kingdom of the Yufirids to Shibam and [[Kawkaban]]. For long periods the Yufirid ruler Ab\u016b \u1e24ass\u0101n As\u02bfad bin Ibr\u0101h\u012bm had to stay in the [[Jawf Governorate|Jawf]] region further to the north. San'a shifted hands with great frequency in this period; from 901 to 913 the city is said to have been conquered 20 times, surrendered through negotiation three times, and been unsuccessfully besieged five times.<ref>''Enzyklop\u00e4die des Islam'', Vol. III, Leiden 1936, p. 155.</ref> Eventually the dynasty managed to defeat the followers of the Fatimids and win back San'a in 916.\n\n==Later history==\n\nAb\u016b \u1e24ass\u0101n As\u02bfad died in 944 and was, as it turned out, the last grand Yufirid leader. In the middle of the tenth century the decline of the dynasty set in as the members of the family feuded with each other. The Zaydi imam [[al-Mukhtar al-Qasim]] managed to acquire San'a in 956 but was murdered in the same year by a [[Banu Hamdan|Hamdan]] chief called Ibn al-Dahhak who dominated politics until 963 and acknowledged the Ziyadids in [[Zabid]]. Next, a chief from [[Khwlan District|Khawlan]] called al-Asmar Yusuf set up the prince Abdallah bin Qahtan on the throne. Abdallah had a long and turbulent reign and successfully attacked the Ziyadids in 989, investing and plundering Zabid. He then stopped mentioning the Abbasids in the [[khutba]] and instead adhered to the Egyptian [[Fatimids|Fatimid]] caliph. Abdallah died in 997 and was succeeded by his son As'ad (II). However, the authority of the Yufirids in San'a now vanished and they had no significance anymore. The clan is occasionally mentioned in the chronicles until as late as 1280.<ref>H.C.
