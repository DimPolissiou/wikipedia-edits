At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as [[euphoria]], change in [[libido|desire for sex]], increased [[wakefulness]], and improved [[Executive functions|cognitive control]]. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as a faster reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause [[Rhabdomyolysis|rapid muscle breakdown]], or induce a [[Stimulant psychosis#Amphetamines|psychosis]] (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include [[insomnia]], [[dry mouth]], and [[loss of appetite]]. The risk of developing an [[addiction]] is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced [[reinforcement|reinforcing effects]] that are present at high doses. Recreational doses of amphetamine are generally much larger than prescribed [[therapeutic dose]]s, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.{{#tag:ref|<ref name=\"Libido\" /><ref name=\"Adderall IR\" /><ref name=\"Malenka_2009\" /><ref name=\"Ergogenics\" /><ref name=\"FDA\" /><ref name=\"Cochrane\" /><ref name=\"Stimulant Misuse\" /><ref name=\"NHMH_3e-Addiction doses\" /><ref name=\"Addiction risk\" /><ref name=\"EncycOfPsychopharm\">{{Cite book | author = Stolerman IP | editor = Stolerman IP | title = Encyclopedia of Psychopharmacology | year = 2010 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin, Germany; London, England | isbn = 9783540686989 | page = 78}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=L|title=Monoamine transporters and psychostimulant addiction|url=|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=75|issue=1|pages=196\u2013217|pmid=17825265|year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.bcp.2007.08.003}}</ref>|group=\"sources\"}}\n\nThe two amphetamine enantiomers that compose Adderall (i.e., levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine) alleviate the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy by increasing the activity of the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] in the [[human brain|brain]], which results in part from their interactions with [[human trace amine-associated receptor&nbsp;1]] (hTAAR1) and [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2) in [[neuron]]s.

Although Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibited uptake, Zn<sup>2+</sup> facilitated [3H]MPP+ release induced by amphetamine, MPP+, or K+-induced depolarization specifically at hDAT but not at the human serotonin and the norepinephrine transporter (hNET).&nbsp;... Surprisingly, this amphetamine-elicited efflux was markedly enhanced, rather than inhibited, by the addition of 10&nbsp;\u03bcM Zn<sup>2+</sup> to the superfusion buffer (Fig. 2 A, open squares). We stress that Zn<sup>2+</sup> per se did not affect basal efflux (Fig. 2 A).&nbsp;... In many brain regions, Zn<sup>2+</sup> is stored in synaptic vesicles and co-released together with glutamate; under basal conditions, the extracellular levels of Zn<sup>2+</sup> are low (\u223c10&nbsp;nM; see Refs. 39, 40). Upon neuronal stimulation, however, Zn<sup>2+</sup> is co-released with the neurotransmitters and, consequently, the free Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration may transiently reach values that range from 10\u201320&nbsp;\u03bcM (10) up to 300&nbsp;\u03bcM (11). The concentrations of Zn<sup>2+</sup> shown in this study, required for the stimulation of dopamine release (as well as inhibition of uptake), covered this physiologically relevant range, with maximum stimulation occurring at 3\u201330&nbsp;\u03bcM. It is therefore conceivable that the action of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on hDAT does not merely reflect a biochemical peculiarity but that it is physiologically relevant.&nbsp;...

At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as [[euphoria]], change in [[libido|desire for sex]], increased [[wakefulness]], and improved [[Executive functions|cognitive control]]. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as a faster reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause [[Rhabdomyolysis|rapid muscle breakdown]], or induce a [[Stimulant psychosis#Amphetamines|psychosis]] (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include [[insomnia]], [[dry mouth]], and [[loss of appetite]]. The risk of developing an [[addiction]] is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced [[reinforcement|reinforcing effects]] that are present at high doses. Recreational doses of amphetamine are generally much larger than prescribed [[therapeutic dose]]s, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.{{#tag:ref|<ref name=\"Libido\" /><ref name=\"Adderall IR\" /><ref name=\"Malenka_2009\" /><ref name=\"Ergogenics\" /><ref name=\"FDA\" /><ref name=\"Cochrane\" /><ref name=\"Stimulant Misuse\" /><ref name=\"NHMH_3e-Addiction doses\" /><ref name=\"Addiction risk\" /><ref name=\"EncycOfPsychopharm\">{{Cite book | author = Stolerman IP | editor = Stolerman IP | title = Encyclopedia of Psychopharmacology | year = 2010 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin, Germany; London, England | isbn = 9783540686989 | page = 78}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=L|title=Monoamine transporters and psychostimulant addiction|url=|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=75|issue=1|pages=196\u2013217|pmid=17825265|year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.bcp.2007.08.003}}</ref>|group=\"sources\"}}\n\nThe two amphetamine enantiomers that compose Adderall (i.e., levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine) alleviate the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy by increasing the activity of the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] in the [[human brain|brain]], which results in part from their interactions with [[human trace amine-associated receptor&nbsp;1]] (hTAAR1) and [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2) in [[neuron]]s.

Although Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibited uptake, Zn<sup>2+</sup> facilitated [3H]MPP+ release induced by amphetamine, MPP+, or K+-induced depolarization specifically at hDAT but not at the human serotonin and the norepinephrine transporter (hNET).&nbsp;... Surprisingly, this amphetamine-elicited efflux was markedly enhanced, rather than inhibited, by the addition of 10&nbsp;\u03bcM Zn<sup>2+</sup> to the superfusion buffer (Fig. 2 A, open squares). We stress that Zn<sup>2+</sup> per se did not affect basal efflux (Fig. 2 A).&nbsp;... In many brain regions, Zn<sup>2+</sup> is stored in synaptic vesicles and co-released together with glutamate; under basal conditions, the extracellular levels of Zn<sup>2+</sup> are low (\u223c10&nbsp;nM; see Refs. 39, 40). Upon neuronal stimulation, however, Zn<sup>2+</sup> is co-released with the neurotransmitters and, consequently, the free Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration may transiently reach values that range from 10\u201320&nbsp;\u03bcM (10) up to 300&nbsp;\u03bcM (11). The concentrations of Zn<sup>2+</sup> shown in this study, required for the stimulation of dopamine release (as well as inhibition of uptake), covered this physiologically relevant range, with maximum stimulation occurring at 3\u201330&nbsp;\u03bcM. It is therefore conceivable that the action of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on hDAT does not merely reflect a biochemical peculiarity but that it is physiologically relevant.&nbsp;... Thus, when Zn<sup>2+</sup> is co-released with glutamate, it may greatly augment the efflux of dopamine.| doi-access = free }}</ref> The human [[serotonin transporter]] and [[norepinephrine transporter]] do not contain zinc binding sites.<ref name=\"Primary 2002 amph-zinc study\" />|group=\"note\"}}<ref name=\"Zinc and PEA\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Scassellati C, Bonvicini C, Faraone SV, Gennarelli M | title = Biomarkers and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review and meta-analyses | journal = J.

The primaries were held on March 6 and the run-offs were held on May 22.\n\nIn 2018, for the first time in at least 25 years, the [[Texas Democratic Party]] fielded at least one candidate in each of the state's 36 congressional districts.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Phillps|first1=Amber|title=The four most important races in Texas's Tuesday primaries|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/03/06/your-cheat-sheet-for-how-to-sound-smart-about-tuesdays-texas-primaries/|accessdate=6 March 2018|publisher=The Washington Post|date=March 6, 2018}}</ref> The state congressional delegation changed from a 25\u201311 Republican majority to a 23\u201313 Republican majority, the most seats that Democrats have won in the state since [[2006 United States House of Representatives elections in Texas|2006]]. Democrats won almost 47% of the vote, likely as part of a [[down-ballot effect]] of Representative [[Beto O'Rourke]]'s [[2018 United States Senate election in Texas|Senate Candidacy]], in which he won 48.3% of the vote.\n\n{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=yes|limit=2}}\n\n==Results summary==\n===Statewide===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2|Party

Chan admitted to Hong Kong authorities that he killed his girlfriend in a hotel room in Taipei, stole her belongings, left her body in the bushes, and flew back to Hong Kong. As the murder happened in Taiwan where they had no jurisdiction, the authorities in Hong Kong could not charge Chan with murder, and could only sentence him on [[money laundering]] charges resulting from the killing. Chan could not be extradited to Taiwan either since there is no extradition treaty between Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nIn February 2019, the [[Hong Kong government]] cited this case as the rationale for a proposed [[2019 Hong Kong extradition bill|amendment to the ordinances regarding extradition]] to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|chief executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty. While the proposed amendment would allow Hong Kong to extradite Chan to Taiwan, concerns over the inclusion of mainland China in the amendment led to the [[2019 Hong Kong protests]]. As such, the murder case is often cited by the media for ultimately sparking the months-long unrest.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50148577|title=The murder case where no-one wants the killer|last=Sui|first=Cindy|date=23 October 2019|access-date=26 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107091406/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50148577|archive-date=7 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/world/asia/hong-kong-murder-taiwan-extradition.html|title=The Murder Case That Lit the Fuse in Hong Kong|last=Victor|first=Daniel|date=15 June 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=26 November 2019|last2=May|first2=Tiffany|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106085716/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/world/asia/hong-kong-murder-taiwan-extradition.html|archive-date=6 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-taiwan-china-hong-kong-chan-tong-kai-murder-20190619-story.html|title=How an obscure Taiwan murder case led to Hong Kong's mega-protests|date=19 June 2019|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=26 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204171603/https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-taiwan-china-hong-kong-chan-tong-kai-murder-20190619-story.html|archive-date=4 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Murder in Taiwan==\nAccording to court documents, the victim Poon Hiu-wing and the accused suspect Chan Tong-kai met in July 2017 while working part-time for the same company.

After they returned to their room in the Purple Garden Hotel in [[Datong District, Taipei|Datong District]], they quarrelled over how to pack their belongings into the suitcase they just bought. The quarrel ended with the two making up and having sex, and Poon messaged her mother at 1:21&nbsp;am of 17 February through [[WhatsApp]] that she would be back in Hong Kong later that night. Around 2&nbsp;am, the two got into another argument, during which Poon revealed the baby she was carrying in her womb was conceived with a former boyfriend, and showed Chan a video of her having sex with another man.

After a 40-minute ride, he got off at [[Zhuwei metro station|Zhuwei station]] and dumped the body in the thickets off the trail along the [[Tamsui River]]. He tossed the suitcase elsewhere and withdrew [[New Taiwan dollar|NT$]]20,000 from Poon's account using her password with the intention of doing more shopping in Taiwan. However, he changed his mind and boarded the plane back to Hong Kong that night.

Hong Kong, as a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region of China]], could not establish its own treaty with Taiwan since China considers Taiwan a [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|breakaway province]] and does not recognise the island's government. Hong Kong also did not have any extradition agreements with [[mainland China]] as a safeguard between the different legal systems of China and Hong Kong, a former British colony that operates on [[Law of Hong Kong|its own laws]] derived from [[English law]]. This safeguard prevents Hong Kong from handing over accused persons to any part of China, which from China's (and thus Hong Kong's) point of view includes Taiwan.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nTo close this \"legal loophole\", the Hong Kong government in February 2019 proposed [[2019 Hong Kong extradition bill|an amendment]] to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|chief executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\">{{cite news|last=Leung|first=Christy|date=1 April 2019|title=Extradition bill not made to measure for mainland China and won't be abandoned, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam says|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3004067/extradition-bill-not-made-measure-mainland-china-and-wont|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|accessdate=20 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501110508/https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3004067/extradition-bill-not-made-measure-mainland-china-and-wont|archive-date=1 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Citing the Chan Tong-kai case in particular, Hong Kong Chief Executive [[Carrie Lam]] mentioned receiving 5 letters from Poon Hiu-wing's parents addressed to her personally seeking justice for their daughter: \"If you have read these letters from Mr. and Mrs. Poon, you would also feel that we must try to help them.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Lam sought to fast-track the proposal with a 20-day public review, described as \"unusually short\", and bypass regular legislative processes, explaining that \"if we act too carefully, and slowly consult society or issue consultation papers, then I am afraid we would not be able to help with this special case.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nThe amendment, which would allow Chan Tong-kai to be brought to Taiwan, would also allow extradition to mainland China.

Chan admitted to Hong Kong authorities that he killed his girlfriend in a hotel room in Taipei, stole her belongings, left her body in the bushes, and flew back to Hong Kong. As the murder happened in Taiwan where they had no jurisdiction, the authorities in Hong Kong could not charge Chan with murder, and could only sentence him on [[money laundering]] charges resulting from the killing. Chan could not be extradited to Taiwan either since there is no extradition treaty between Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nIn February 2019, the [[Hong Kong government]] cited this case as the rationale for a proposed [[2019 Hong Kong extradition bill|amendment to the ordinances regarding extradition]] to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|chief executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty. While the proposed amendment would allow Hong Kong to extradite Chan to Taiwan, concerns over the inclusion of mainland China in the amendment led to the [[2019 Hong Kong protests]]. As such, the murder case is often cited by the media for ultimately sparking the months-long unrest.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50148577|title=The murder case where no-one wants the killer|last=Sui|first=Cindy|date=23 October 2019|access-date=26 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107091406/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50148577|archive-date=7 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/world/asia/hong-kong-murder-taiwan-extradition.html|title=The Murder Case That Lit the Fuse in Hong Kong|last=Victor|first=Daniel|date=15 June 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=26 November 2019|last2=May|first2=Tiffany|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106085716/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/world/asia/hong-kong-murder-taiwan-extradition.html|archive-date=6 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-taiwan-china-hong-kong-chan-tong-kai-murder-20190619-story.html|title=How an obscure Taiwan murder case led to Hong Kong's mega-protests|date=19 June 2019|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=26 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204171603/https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-taiwan-china-hong-kong-chan-tong-kai-murder-20190619-story.html|archive-date=4 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Murder in Taiwan==\nAccording to court documents, the victim Poon Hiu-wing and the accused suspect Chan Tong-kai met in July 2017 while working part-time for the same company.

After they returned to their room in the Purple Garden Hotel in [[Datong District, Taipei|Datong District]], they quarrelled over how to pack their belongings into the suitcase they just bought. The quarrel ended with the two making up and having sex, and Poon messaged her mother at 1:21&nbsp;am of 17 February through [[WhatsApp]] that she would be back in Hong Kong later that night. Around 2&nbsp;am, the two got into another argument, during which Poon revealed the baby she was carrying in her womb was conceived with a former boyfriend, and showed Chan a video of her having sex with another man. Chan reacted with rage and smashed her head against the wall of the hotel room and started strangling her from behind with his hands. They struggled on the floor for around 10 minutes until Poon was dead. Chan then folded her body into the suitcase, packed her belongings, and went to bed.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOn the morning of 17 February, Chan disposed of Poon's belongings at garbage bins around the hotel\u2014though keeping her ATM card, her digital camera, and her iPhone\u2014and dragged the suitcase (with the body inside) into the [[Taipei Metro]]. After a 40-minute ride, he got off at [[Zhuwei metro station|Zhuwei station]] and dumped the body in the thickets off the trail along the [[Tamsui River]]. He tossed the suitcase elsewhere and withdrew [[New Taiwan dollar|NT$]]20,000 from Poon's account using her password with the intention of doing more shopping in Taiwan. However, he changed his mind and boarded the plane back to Hong Kong that night.

Hong Kong, as a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region of China]], could not establish its own treaty with Taiwan since China considers Taiwan a [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|breakaway province]] and does not recognise the island's government. Hong Kong also did not have any extradition agreements with [[mainland China]] as a safeguard between the different legal systems of China and Hong Kong, a former British colony that operates on [[Law of Hong Kong|its own laws]] derived from [[English law]].

On 18 October, days before Chan was to be released, the Hong Kong government released a statement reiterating that they have no jurisdiction over Chan's alleged crimes in Taiwan, and they have no grounds to extend his sentence, implying that Chan could walk free after his release. On the other hand, the statement said Chan expressed willingness to surrender himself to Taiwanese authorities, and has asked the Hong Kong government to help make the proper arrangements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201910/18/P2019101800886.htm|title=Suspect of Taiwan homicide case voluntarily surrenders himself to Taiwan|publisher=Government of Hong Kong|access-date=1 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117201950/https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201910/18/P2019101800886.htm|archive-date=17 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nTaiwan initially refused this arrangement, citing the need to have a judicial assistance agreement with Hong Kong so it can obtain key documents relating to the case.

Director Emeritus of the [[Museum of Arts & Design|Museum of Arts and Design]] (formerly the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, of which he served as director in 1963\u20131979, and, following the change of the museum's name to American Craft Museum, 1979\u20131987<ref>\"Museum History,\" Museum of Arts & Design, http://madmuseum.org/about/history.

With an interest in exploring craft skills, he took courses at the local Buffalo [[YWCA]] craft program, where he later taught [[studio pottery|ceramic]] classes. He also took a few classes at the School for American Craftsmen (now the [[School for American Crafts]]) at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]; this interest led   to his membership in the organization Buffalo Craftsmen, where he served as president in 1962, and his active involvement with York State Craftsmen, a state organization that held an annual craft fair in [[Ithaca, New York]].\n\nHe took a position in the display department of the [[Flint & Kent]] department store in 1953, and was appointed Display Director there in 1955.<ref>A brief overview of Smith's early career can be found in Glenn Adamson, \u201cGatherings: Creating the Studio Craft Movement,\u201d in Jeannine Falino, ed., Crafting Modernism: Midcentury American Art and Design (New York: Abrams; Museum of Arts and Design, 2011), p. 41, as well as a biographical entry in the same text, p. 311\u201312.
