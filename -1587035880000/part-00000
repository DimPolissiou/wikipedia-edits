They play in the [[Super League]]. They have also played home matches in [[Barcelona]], attracting a Super League regular season record crowd of 31,555 against the [[Wigan Warriors]] at the [[Nou Camp]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/48327428 |title=Dragons:Nou Camp return would be welcomed after Wigan success |work=BBC Sport |date=19 May 2019}}</ref> Along with the [[Toronto Wolfpack]], they are currently the only teams in the competition from outside England. The Dragons play home games at [[Stade Gilbert Brutus]]. They were the first non British team to win the Challenge Cup since the competition started in 1896, after beating [[Warrington Wolves]] 20\u201314 at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 25 August 2018.\n\nThe club was formed in 2000 by a merger of [[XIII Catalan]] and [[AS Saint-Est\u00e8ve]] into Union Treiziste Catalane (UTC). They won the 2005 [[French Rugby League Championship|French Championship]] and the [[Lord Derby Cup]] in 2004 and 2005. In 2006, they were granted a Super League licence, taking the name Catalans Dragons. UTC continues to compete in the French Championship's [[Elite One Championship]] as a feeder club for the Dragons, now under the name [[Saint-Est\u00e8ve XIII Catalan]].\n\n== History ==\n===2000\u20132004: foundation===\nThe club was founded in 2000 after the merger of two teams in [[Perpignan]], [[XIII Catalan]] and [[AS Saint Est\u00e8ve]]. The merged team took the name Union Treiziste Catalane, often abbreviated to UTC.\n\nXIII Catalan were founded in 1935 and thus were founding members of the [[French Championship]]. During their run, they won 11 French Championships and 11 [[Lord Derby Cup]]s. [[AS Saint-Est\u00e8ve]] were founded in 1965. They won six championships and four Lord Derby Cups. There were two other clubs in the twelve-team competition in Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales: [[Pia XIII]] and Saint-Cyprien. In 2002 Saint-Cyprien joined the merged UTC side. UTC won the 2005 French Championship and the 2004 and 2005 [[Lord Derby Cup]]s.\n\n===2005\u20132007: Super League and Challenge Cup final===\nIn 2005, UTC applied to join the [[Super League]], the highest tier of professional rugby league in Europe. They were selected ahead of [[Toulouse Olympique]] and [[Villeneuve Leopards]] to enter the league for the [[Super League XI|2006 season]]. The franchise was named Catalans Dragons; UTC remained in the French Championship to serve as a reserve club. The club set a target for 75% of the players be qualified to play for [[France national rugby league team|France]].\n\nThe Catalans are not the first French side to play in the Super League, but the first, [[Paris Saint-Germain Rugby League|Paris Saint-Germain]], lasted only two seasons. Both [[rugby football|rugby]] codes have their stronghold in the southwest of France, and the north of France is more football-friendly. Players on loan from French league clubs had to play for their own clubs as well, train in the south and take the long journey to Paris or England for matches.\n[[Image:LesCatalansdragonslogo.png|right|thumb|200px|Catalans Dragons logo used in 2006 and 2007.]]\nTo ensure that the Catalans had the best French players available to them, the French rugby league decided to let them sign players from other French clubs without paying a transfer fee. The league also would not relegate them from the Super League for three years, even if they finished last. Many{{who|date=April 2019}} believe that the Catalans will be joined by other French clubs in the Super League,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} but the whole idea of expanding into France had critics. The Catalans won their first ever Super League match 38\u201330 against [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] on 11 February 2006, at [[Stade Aim\u00e9 Giral]]. The club encountered a steep learning curve in their first season in the Super League. Many of less experienced French players suffered from tiredness towards the end of a gruelling, injury-marred campaign. A particular loss was that of key playmaker and captain Stacey Jones, who missed much of the season with a broken arm. The team eventually finished bottom of the table, but the three-year exemption from relegation kept them in the Super League.\n\nThe year 2007 saw a strong recruitment by new coach Mick Potter with a string of high-profile signings from Australia, including Clint Greenshields, Casey McGuire, Jason Croker and Aaron Gorrell, all seasoned NRL campaigners. Gorrell, a goalkicking 'hooker',  impressed in the first month but sustained a bad knee injury in February's win over [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] and missed the rest of the season. On 10 March 2007, it was announced that Newcastle Knights hooker [[Luke Quigley]] would cover Gorrell's absence for the remainder of the campaign, but a number of players sustained injuries throughout the campaign.\n\nOn 29 July 2007, the Catalans became the first [[France|French]] side and first non-British side to reach the final of the [[Challenge Cup]] after beating [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] 37\u201324 in the semifinal. The Catalans lost the [[2007 Challenge Cup Final]] with [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 25 August 2007. They also managed to finish the [[Super League XII|2007 season]] off the bottom of the table, ending the season in a respectable tenth place.\n[[File:DragonsCatalans2009.jpg|thumb|right|The Catalans Dragons team playing at Gilbert Brutus in 2009]]\n[[File:Catalan Dragon supporters at Headingley.jpg|thumb|right|The Catalans Dragons supporters at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] in [[Leeds]], [[England]].]]\n\n===2008\u20132017: playoffs and progression===\nIn [[Super League XIII|2008]], the Catalans secured their first playoff berth by finishing third on the league ladder largely on the back of a ferocious forward pack. They smashed [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]] 46\u20138 in their first-ever playoff match on 13 September in Perpignan, but 20 September saw [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] blow open what had been a close game in the second half of their elimination semifinal, with Wigan ultimately winning 50\u201326. Coach Mick Potter left the Dragons at the end of the 2008 season to replace Daniel Anderson at St Helens.\n\nIn 2009, they were involved in two historic milestones for the sport of rugby league in Europe. During their match away to the [[Wales|Welsh]] club [[Crusaders Rugby League|Crusaders]] on 23 May, the two clubs played the first Super League match to not feature an English team.<ref name=\"nonAnglo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rleague.com/db/article.php?id=33325|title=Super League's First Ever International (with no English)|publisher=www.rleague.com (The World of Rugby League)|accessdate=2009-06-20|last=O'Neill|first=Matthew|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525190742/http://www.rleague.com/db/article.php?id=33325|archivedate=2009-05-25}}</ref> History was also created on 20 June, when the club played in the first Super League game to be played in Spain, at [[Barcelona]]'s [[Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys]], the venue for the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], against [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]].

After a recruitment drive, which saw a number of transfers from the NRL, expectations were high. After opening defeats to Wigan and Hull FC, the Dragons edged Leeds 32\u201328 in round three and then took seven wins from their next eight matches. Following their 42\u201332 win over Salford at the end of April, Laurent Frayssinous' side sat second in the table, level on points with leaders Warrington. However, a series of injury setbacks to key players in the second half of the season saw them drop down the table. Catalans lost their final six regular season games which meant they headed into the Super 8s two points adrift of fourth-placed St Helens. Five defeats from seven saw them finish the season in sixth place and miss out on a play-off spot. After a difficult two years at Huddersfield, Jodie Broughton's move to the south of France saw him kick-start his career. The winger scored 19 tries in 2016 including four in the Dragons' 30\u201312 win over St Helens in April. Todd Carney was released after two seasons at Catalans.<ref>[http://www.rugby-league.com/article/39016/season-review-catalans-dragons#sthash.ULwfokkn.dpuf Season Review: Catalans Dragons], 3rd December 2016</ref>\n\n===2018-2019: Success===\nOn 25 August 2018, Catalans Dragons won their first Rugby League trophy, after defeating Warrington Wolves 20-14 in the [[2018 Challenge Cup|2018 Challenge Cup Final]], in the process becoming the first non-English team to win the competition in its long, illustrious history.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/45260134|title=Challenge Cup final: Catalans beat Warrington 20-14 to win first trophy|last=Scott|first=Ged|date=25 August 2018|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/25/catalans-dragons-warrington-wolves-challenge-cup-final-match-report |title =Catalans Dragons beat Warrington in Challenge Cup final to make history|date=25 August 2018|work=Guardian|accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n===2020: Controversy===\nOn 28 January 2020, Catalans Dragons announced that they had signed [[Israel Folau]] despite him holding to the Biblical teaching that those who practice homosexuality without repenting will go to hell (going so far as to suggest that the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires were God's judgment on Australia for allowing same sex marriage and abortion).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/18/israel-folau-says-bushfires-and-drought-are-gods-punishment-for-same-sex-marriage-and-abortion|title=Israel Folau under fire for implying bushfires are God's punishment|date=18 November 2019|work=Guardian|accessdate=29 January 2020}}</ref>\nWigan Warriors responded by saying that their next game against Catalans would be named Pride Day.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/28/israel-folau-switches-codes-again-to-sign-for-catalans-dragons-rugby-league|title=Israel Folau: shock and outrage greets Catalans Dragons' signing|date=28 January 2020|work=Guardian|accessdate=29 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Stadiums==\n===Stade Aim\u00e9 Giral: 2006\u20132007===\n[[Image:aimegiral.jpg|right|250px|Stade Aim\u00e9 Giral]]\n{{Main|Stade Aim\u00e9 Giral}}\nThe Catalans moved into the stadium in 2006, when they were accepted into [[Super League]].

They play in the [[Super League]]. They have also played home matches in [[Barcelona]], attracting a Super League regular season record crowd of 31,555 against the [[Wigan Warriors]] at the [[Nou Camp]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/48327428 |title=Dragons:Nou Camp return would be welcomed after Wigan success |work=BBC Sport |date=19 May 2019}}</ref> Along with the [[Toronto Wolfpack]], they are currently the only teams in the competition from outside England. The Dragons play home games at [[Stade Gilbert Brutus]]. They were the first non British team to win the Challenge Cup since the competition started in 1896, after beating [[Warrington Wolves]] 20\u201314 at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 25 August 2018.\n\nThe club was formed in 2000 by a merger of [[XIII Catalan]] and [[AS Saint-Est\u00e8ve]] into Union Treiziste Catalane (UTC). They won the 2005 [[French Rugby League Championship|French Championship]] and the [[Lord Derby Cup]] in 2004 and 2005. In 2006, they were granted a Super League licence, taking the name Catalans Dragons. UTC continues to compete in the French Championship's [[Elite One Championship]] as a feeder club for the Dragons, now under the name [[Saint-Est\u00e8ve XIII Catalan]].\n\n== History ==\n===2000\u20132004: foundation===\nThe club was founded in 2000 after the merger of two teams in [[Perpignan]], [[XIII Catalan]] and [[AS Saint Est\u00e8ve]]. The merged team took the name Union Treiziste Catalane, often abbreviated to UTC.\n\nXIII Catalan were founded in 1935 and thus were founding members of the [[French Championship]]. During their run, they won 11 French Championships and 11 [[Lord Derby Cup]]s. [[AS Saint-Est\u00e8ve]] were founded in 1965. They won six championships and four Lord Derby Cups. There were two other clubs in the twelve-team competition in Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales: [[Pia XIII]] and Saint-Cyprien. In 2002 Saint-Cyprien joined the merged UTC side. UTC won the 2005 French Championship and the 2004 and 2005 [[Lord Derby Cup]]s.\n\n===2005\u20132007: Super League and Challenge Cup final===\nIn 2005, UTC applied to join the [[Super League]], the highest tier of professional rugby league in Europe. They were selected ahead of [[Toulouse Olympique]] and [[Villeneuve Leopards]] to enter the league for the [[Super League XI|2006 season]]. The franchise was named Catalans Dragons; UTC remained in the French Championship to serve as a reserve club. The club set a target for 75% of the players be qualified to play for [[France national rugby league team|France]].\n\nThe Catalans are not the first French side to play in the Super League, but the first, [[Paris Saint-Germain Rugby League|Paris Saint-Germain]], lasted only two seasons. Both [[rugby football|rugby]] codes have their stronghold in the southwest of France, and the north of France is more football-friendly. Players on loan from French league clubs had to play for their own clubs as well, train in the south and take the long journey to Paris or England for matches.\n[[Image:LesCatalansdragonslogo.png|right|thumb|200px|Catalans Dragons logo used in 2006 and 2007.]]\nTo ensure that the Catalans had the best French players available to them, the French rugby league decided to let them sign players from other French clubs without paying a transfer fee. The league also would not relegate them from the Super League for three years, even if they finished last. Many{{who|date=April 2019}} believe that the Catalans will be joined by other French clubs in the Super League,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} but the whole idea of expanding into France had critics. The Catalans won their first ever Super League match 38\u201330 against [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] on 11 February 2006, at [[Stade Aim\u00e9 Giral]]. The club encountered a steep learning curve in their first season in the Super League. Many of less experienced French players suffered from tiredness towards the end of a gruelling, injury-marred campaign. A particular loss was that of key playmaker and captain Stacey Jones, who missed much of the season with a broken arm. The team eventually finished bottom of the table, but the three-year exemption from relegation kept them in the Super League.\n\nThe year 2007 saw a strong recruitment by new coach Mick Potter with a string of high-profile signings from Australia, including Clint Greenshields, Casey McGuire, Jason Croker and Aaron Gorrell, all seasoned NRL campaigners. Gorrell, a goalkicking 'hooker',  impressed in the first month but sustained a bad knee injury in February's win over [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] and missed the rest of the season. On 10 March 2007, it was announced that Newcastle Knights hooker [[Luke Quigley]] would cover Gorrell's absence for the remainder of the campaign, but a number of players sustained injuries throughout the campaign.\n\nOn 29 July 2007, the Catalans became the first [[France|French]] side and first non-British side to reach the final of the [[Challenge Cup]] after beating [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] 37\u201324 in the semifinal. The Catalans lost the [[2007 Challenge Cup Final]] with [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 25 August 2007. They also managed to finish the [[Super League XII|2007 season]] off the bottom of the table, ending the season in a respectable tenth place.\n[[File:DragonsCatalans2009.jpg|thumb|right|The Catalans Dragons team playing at Gilbert Brutus in 2009]]\n[[File:Catalan Dragon supporters at Headingley.jpg|thumb|right|The Catalans Dragons supporters at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] in [[Leeds]], [[England]].]]\n\n===2008\u20132017: playoffs and progression===\nIn [[Super League XIII|2008]], the Catalans secured their first playoff berth by finishing third on the league ladder largely on the back of a ferocious forward pack. They smashed [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]] 46\u20138 in their first-ever playoff match on 13 September in Perpignan, but 20 September saw [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] blow open what had been a close game in the second half of their elimination semifinal, with Wigan ultimately winning 50\u201326. Coach Mick Potter left the Dragons at the end of the 2008 season to replace Daniel Anderson at St Helens.\n\nIn 2009, they were involved in two historic milestones for the sport of rugby league in Europe. During their match away to the [[Wales|Welsh]] club [[Crusaders Rugby League|Crusaders]] on 23 May, the two clubs played the first Super League match to not feature an English team.<ref name=\"nonAnglo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rleague.com/db/article.php?id=33325|title=Super League's First Ever International (with no English)|publisher=www.rleague.com (The World of Rugby League)|accessdate=2009-06-20|last=O'Neill|first=Matthew|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525190742/http://www.rleague.com/db/article.php?id=33325|archivedate=2009-05-25}}</ref> History was also created on 20 June, when the club played in the first Super League game to be played in Spain, at [[Barcelona]]'s [[Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys]], the venue for the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], against [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]].

After a recruitment drive, which saw a number of transfers from the NRL, expectations were high. After opening defeats to Wigan and Hull FC, the Dragons edged Leeds 32\u201328 in round three and then took seven wins from their next eight matches. Following their 42\u201332 win over Salford at the end of April, Laurent Frayssinous' side sat second in the table, level on points with leaders Warrington. However, a series of injury setbacks to key players in the second half of the season saw them drop down the table. Catalans lost their final six regular season games which meant they headed into the Super 8s two points adrift of fourth-placed St Helens. Five defeats from seven saw them finish the season in sixth place and miss out on a play-off spot. After a difficult two years at Huddersfield, Jodie Broughton's move to the south of France saw him kick-start his career. The winger scored 19 tries in 2016 including four in the Dragons' 30\u201312 win over St Helens in April. Todd Carney was released after two seasons at Catalans.<ref>[http://www.rugby-league.com/article/39016/season-review-catalans-dragons#sthash.ULwfokkn.dpuf Season Review: Catalans Dragons], 3rd December 2016</ref>\n\n===2018-2019: Success===\nOn 25 August 2018, Catalans Dragons won their first Rugby League trophy, after defeating Warrington Wolves 20-14 in the [[2018 Challenge Cup|2018 Challenge Cup Final]], in the process becoming the first non-English team to win the competition in its long, illustrious history.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/45260134|title=Challenge Cup final: Catalans beat Warrington 20-14 to win first trophy|last=Scott|first=Ged|date=25 August 2018|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/25/catalans-dragons-warrington-wolves-challenge-cup-final-match-report |title =Catalans Dragons beat Warrington in Challenge Cup final to make history|date=25 August 2018|work=Guardian|accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n===2020: Controversy===\nOn 28 January 2020, Catalans Dragons announced that they had signed [[Israel Folau]] despite him holding to the Biblical teaching that those who practice homosexuality without repenting will go to hell (going so far as to suggest that the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires were God's judgment on Australia for allowing same sex marriage and abortion).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/18/israel-folau-says-bushfires-and-drought-are-gods-punishment-for-same-sex-marriage-and-abortion|title=Israel Folau under fire for implying bushfires are God's punishment|date=18 November 2019|work=Guardian|accessdate=29 January 2020}}</ref>\nWigan Warriors responded by saying that their next game against Catalans would be named Pride Day.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/28/israel-folau-switches-codes-again-to-sign-for-catalans-dragons-rugby-league|title=Israel Folau: shock and outrage greets Catalans Dragons' signing|date=28 January 2020|work=Guardian|accessdate=29 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Stadiums==\n===Stade Aim\u00e9 Giral: 2006\u20132007===\n[[Image:aimegiral.jpg|right|250px|Stade Aim\u00e9 Giral]]\n{{Main|Stade Aim\u00e9 Giral}}\nThe Catalans moved into the stadium in 2006, when they were accepted into [[Super League]].

Ramlee]]. It is the fourth instalment in the ''\"Bujang Lapok\"'' series of films, but the last to feature P. Ramlee, [[S. Shamsuddin]] and [[Aziz Sattar]] as the main trio of actors. However, it is not a direct sequel to the previous ''\"Bujang Lapok\"'' films, as there are no references to the events of the previous films.\n\nThe film is a self-referential spoof of the Malay [[film industry]] of the late 1950s/early 1960s. The plot revolves around the main trio attempting to become actors and break into the film business, and hence features a fictionalised look at the behind-the-scenes process of Malay film-making during that time. The line between reality and fiction is blurred as real film industry places are used, real film sets of previous Malay films are used for the film-within-the-film, and all the featured actors use their real-life names or derivatives thereof.\n\n==Plot==\nThe \"bujang lapok\" trio of Ramli, Sudin and Ajis go to Jalan Ampas Studio in Singapore in response to an open call audition. During their audition, they drive director Ahmad Nisfu crazy by forgetting their scripts and improvising with their own lines. However, the studio boss likes their natural comedic talent and tells the director that the trio are to be signed on for an oncoming film. The three of them are themselves taken by surprise but are nonetheless pleased at the outcome.\n\nMost of the movie centre around their lives in a house shared with other tenants (they all each rent a room). During their first evening memorising scripts for their new movie, they encounter one disruption after another. First, it was the husband and wife dancing to loud music, then it's the neighbour with the motorcycle problems, then it's the fat drunk trumpeter who is practising his instrument a bit too loudly. After dealing with each problematic neighbour in their own unique way, they then settle down to memorise their lines.\n\nThe following day, filming begins on their new movie. Despite having learned their lines, they fumble through them and end up infiurating the director so much that he collapses. He is brought to the hospital where he is diagnosed with stress and released. The three bachelors are on hand to visit him with flowers in hand. Initially pleased with the visit, he collapses again when he sees them, the ones who made him collapse in the first place. \n\nBack at home, they are greeted by Salmah, their next door neighbour, and the object of Ramli's affections. They banter to and fro and then Salmah runs off from the room in tears whilst trying to tell Ramli something. When they meet later that night, Salmah tells Ramli that someone has come to ask for her hand in marriage. When she reveals the person, it is Sharif Dol, a bully from a neighbouring village, who has been harassing Salmah for some time. He then appears at the scene and starts taunting Ramli and Salmah. Ramli tells Salmah to go home whilst he deals with Shariff Dol and challenges him to a fight. Back at the room, both Sudin and Ajis wait for him back at their room with food on the table. Sudin is already hungry but it is their agreement that they always eat together, the three of them. Unwilling to wait for him any more, Sudin wants to go and look for Ramli and they leave their dinner to find Ramli all bruised and passed out at his usual meeting place with Salmah. After settling him down, Sudin brings out some of the dinner that he has brought with him and the three of them enjoy them together.\n\nThe next day, Salmah and her mother receives a visit from Shariff Dol and his mother. They begin discussing the terms of the wedding and Shariff Dol gives Salmah's mother some money to tide her over until the big day. Salmah keeps silent but shows her disapproval to Shariff Dol from across the room. Later on that day, Sudin and Ajis go on their separate adventures in the evening whilst Ramli and Salmah lament their love for each other. When both of them return, they tell Ramli about their evening whilst he looks on in silence. When asked, he tells them that he wants to marry but doesn't have the money to do so. Sudin then tells him he has the answer for it and produces a 'magic stone' he had purchased earlier in the evening by a roadside seller who assures him that with a little ritual, all his deepest wishes will be fulfilled. Ramli is consoled and thanks Sudin for being a good friend.\n\nLater on during the night, they each encounter some more of their neighbours' antics, one involving a policeman and another involving a dispute between an Indian husband and wife and a soiled baby diaper. They finally settle in for the night and when they wake up the next morning and make their way for their morning rituals, Ramli peeps into Salmah's room only to be scared off by her emergence from the room. The next few scenes show their lives in the village as they go about getting themselves ready to go to the film studio in their quest to fulfill Ramli's wish to be married. Sudin fails in his attempts to acquire the financial resources Ramli needs for his intended wedding and in fury, Sudin throws the magic stone into the stream. The next scene is of Salmah and her adamant refusal to marry Shariff Dol. She then reveals to her mother that he has been the one harassing her for so long and she has no wish to marry him. Salmah's mother is similarly furious and returns him the money he had given to her. Shariff Dol takes the news in stride but promises revenge for the humiliation he has endured. \n\nLater on in the evening, Salmah informs Ramli that she has turned Shariff Dol's marriage proposal down once and for all. Ramli is pleased but Salmah wants to proceed with their marriage as they had intended to but Ramli admits to her that he has no finances to support their marriage and wedding. Salmah suggests using her savings instead and they gleefully leave for home together. When they arrive home, they find their house in flames and their neighbours running around in horror. Whilst Ramli is resigned to the fate that they will be homeless, Salmah is convinced that it is Shariff Dol's [[arson|doing]]. She tells the same to Sudin and Ajis who round up the rest of their neighbours to find Shariff Dol and bring him to the police station. In the meantime, Ramli finds a wallet at the scene of the crime, proving that it was indeed Shariff Dol who perpetrated the crime. Ramli pursues Shariff Dol and they fight again when Ramli tells him he found his wallet at the scene of the fire. Shariff Dol eventually admits defeat when it is apparent he would not win the fight. About the same time, Salmah arrives with the rest of the angry tenants demanding justice for their burnt house. Ramli emerges from the house with Shariff Dol tied up and persuades them to surrender him to the police instead. The evening ends well for all three bachelors when all their romantic halves join them and they walk into the moonlight together.\n\n==Songs==\n* Menchecheh Bujang Lapok\n* Gelora\n* Senandung Kasih\n* Embun Menitik (by late Ahmad Patek)\n\nThe songs were sung by Saloma,P.Ramlee,S.Shamsuddin,Aziz Sattar, and Pancha Sitara band.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[P.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''D'''iesel (D), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''2'''nd generation (2). A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]\n\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s. The '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name = \"interactive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html |title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive |author=Sheeju Chandran |date= |work= |publisher = Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate = April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n== Orgins ==\nThe WDM-2 history begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be manufactured in India. General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement so the ALCo prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].\n\n== Production History ==\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCO(order no. D3389) in the United States. The first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n\nWhile ALCO went bankrupt, DLW varanasi successfully adapted the technology and produced may upgraded versions which were exported to many BG countries. Later a number of modifications were made and a few subclasses were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's\n\n\n\nThe WDM-2 is the diesel workhorse of the Indian Railways, being very reliable and rugged.{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left:18040 WDM-2 diesel loco at National Railway Museum, Delhi, Right:18233 WDM-2 Kundan, first diesel loco assembled at DLW,Varanasi\n}}\n\n== Service History ==\nKTE was the first shed to hold WDM2. The whole batch of WDM2 imports had all went to KTE. #18040 was first loco in the series, but 18042 was the first commissioned. Third DLS is listed as GY in 1963 and first loco was WDM2 18207. Fourth DLS is listed as ET in 1964 and first loco was WDM2 18043, so probably it got transfers from KTE initially. Fifth DLS is listed as [[Diesel loco shed, Erode|ED]] in 1966. Sixth DLS is listed as RTM in 1967 and first loco was #18417.\n\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localised extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]] and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.\n\n== Some of the sheds holding WDM-2/A/B/G locomotives ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abu Road railway station|Abu Road]] - 3\n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]] - 4\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]] - 1\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] - 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Kurla]] - 1\n* [[New Katni Jn. railway station|New Katni Jn.]] - 1 \n* [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]] - 8\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] - 3\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Tondiarpet]] - 4\n''' Total Locomotioves active in service as of 01-03-2020:''' 30<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n}}\n<br />'''Source:''' http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,541,710,717\n\n== Liveries ==\n\n* GOC: ICF Rajdhani livery but red replaced by green.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''D'''iesel (D), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''2'''nd generation (2). A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]\n\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s. The '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name = \"interactive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html |title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive |author=Sheeju Chandran |date= |work= |publisher = Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate = April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n== History ==\nThe WDM-2 history begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO   submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke     turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be manufactured in India. General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement so the ALCo prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].\n\n== Production History ==\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCo(order no. D3389) in the United States. The first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n\nLater a number of modifications were made and a few subclasses were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's\n\nThe WDM-2 is the diesel workhorse of the Indian Railways, being very reliable and rugged.{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left:18040 WDM-2 diesel loco at National Railway Museum, Delhi, Right:18233 WDM-2 Kundan, first diesel loco assembled at DLW,Varanasi\n}}\n\n== Some of the sheds holding WDM-2/A/B/G locomotives ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abu Road railway station|Abu Road]] - 3\n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]] - 4\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]] - 1\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] - 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Kurla]] - 1\n* [[New Katni Jn. railway station|New Katni Jn.]] - 1 \n* [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]] - 8\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] - 3\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Tondiarpet]] - 4\n''' Total Locomotioves active in service as of 01-03-2020:''' 30<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n}}\n<br />'''Source:''' http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,541,710,717\n\n== Technical specifications<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2d.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives -- Specific classes : AC Electric|website=www.irfca.org}}</ref> ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Manufacturers\n|Alco, DLW\n|-\n|Engine\n|Alco 251-B, [[V16 engine|16 cylinder engine]], {{convert|2600|hp|abbr=on|lk=on}} ({{convert|2430|hp|abbr=on|disp=or}} site rating) with Alco 710/720/?? turbo supercharged engine. 1,000 rpm max, 400 rpm idle; {{convert|228|x|266|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} bore x stroke; compression ratio 12.5:1.

Parveen is ill due to Jinn's magic and can be protected only if Aman marries an Ayaana; a woman with the heart of an angel. Salma pretends to be sick, forcing Roshni to marry Aman for money. Aman misunderstands Roshni to be a gold digger. He starts detesting her and gives her a cheque in exchange of marrying him. Aman and Roshni get married.\n\nRoshni feels a connection with Aman but is hurt by his indifferent behaviour. Kabir Junaid Khan makes his entry. Roshni dies while saving Aman from Kabir. Aman realises his feelings for Roshni and is left heartbroken.\n\nKabir brings back Roshni to life but keeps her under his control, aiming to separate her from Aman. Kabir's hold on Roshni gets destroyed when Aman stabs her with a magical dagger. Parveen kills Kabir to become the Queen of Jinns. She tries to kill Aman next, but fails.\n\nAliya returns with Kabir's baby and tries to separate Aman and Roshni. Aliya is revealed to be a [[Demoness|Haiwana]]. Roshni tries to expose her, but fails. Aliya attacks Parveen resulting in Parveen going in a coma. Aman, believing it's Roshni's fault, asks her to leave the house.\n\n===One year later===\nRoshni decides to open a bakery by taking a loan. Aman spends time drinking to overcome his loneliness. Aman receives news about Parveen's kidney failure. Roshni and Aman meet. Aman destroys Roshni's bakery believing her to be the reason of Parveen's condition. Roshni is devastated. Aman offers her a job for her to repay the loan. Due to Salma's worsening health, Roshni accepts the job and works as his private secretary.\n\nAs the two come closer, Aman reveals to Roshni that he tried to hate her but cannot. They consummate their relationship. In order to save Parveen, Roshni secretly donates her kidney.
