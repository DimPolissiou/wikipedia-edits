It prefers moist soil in spring, drier in summer, and does well in full sun or partial shade. It is very hardy.\n\n==Association with Linnaeus==\nLinnaeus had seen a drawing of ''Lamprocapnos spectabilis'' (old-fashioned bleeding heart) in the thesis of a Russian student who was describing many Siberian plants.

Starting with four teams, the LFA has since expanded to eight members as of 2019. The championship game is called [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), and it is currently played on the second Sunday in May. The players are drafted from the country's two [[college football]] conferences: [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]] and [[Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Deportiva Estudiantil de Instituciones Privadas|CONADEIP]].\n\n== History ==\nAmerican football has been played in Mexico since the 1920s and is the fourth most popular sport in the country. The LFA was the brainchild of Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez, a former [[Fox Sports Latin America|Fox Sports]] commentator. V\u00e1zquez was a huge fan of the previous American football league in Mexico called Liga Master, and he had always dreamed of creating his own league. In 2015, V\u00e1zquez (along with Edgar Zapata) managed to put together a group of investors who decided to offer football while the [[NFL]], [[NCAA]], [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]], and CONADEIP are in the offseason and founded the LFA, which would start two weeks after [[Super Bowl 50]]. The LFA would be the first American football league in Mexico in 20 years.<ref>https://weexpats.com/mexican-league-playing-american-football-meet-lfa/</ref>\n\nFour charter members participated in the inaugural 2016 season: the [[Mexicas CDMX|Eagles]], the [[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]], the [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]], and the [[Condors CDMX|Condors]]. All teams were based in [[Mexico City]]. The first game was played February 21, 2016, between the Raptors and the Mayas, with the Mayas winning the game 34-6. The first title game, the [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), was held on April 10, 2016 between the Mayas and the Raptors. The Mayas won Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico I, 29-13. All games were played at the [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Palillo Mart\u00ednez Stadium]] of [[Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City]]. The LFA experienced significant financial problems during 2016, with a season average attendance of only 2,000 per game.  \n\nDespite the financial difficulties of 2016, the LFA expanded to six teams in 2017, with the addition of [[Dinos Saltillo]] and [[Fundidores Monterrey]] (Spanish for smelters or founders), who took players from the college programs in the ONEFA and CONADEIP. Due to the difficulty of travel, the Dinos nearly canceled going to Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/new_site/articulo/dino-a-los-maltratos|title=Dino to the abuse}} Z\u00f3calo(In Spanish)</ref> In the end, the game was played on April 30, 2017 at [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"]] between the Mayas and the Dinos. The Mayas maintained dominance over the league and won the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico for the second time, 24-18.\n\nOn October 28, 2017,  Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez left the presidency of the LFA. The title of President was eliminated and the position of the Commissioner was created, which was occupied by Guillermo Ruiz Burguete<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasillarota.com/deportes/para-su-tercera-temporada-lfa-tendra-nueva-cara-lfa-condors-mayas-fundidores/196862|title=For its third season, LFA will have a new face}}</ref> On January 16, the newly appointed LFA commissioner, Guillermo Ruiz Burguete, resigned. The league did not announce his replacement. For operational purposes, the activities of the commissioner were absorbed by the president of the board of directors of the league, \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasillarota.com/deportes/renuncia-comisionado-lfa-guillermo-ruiz-burguete-lfa-burguete-comisionado/200234|title=LFA commissioner resignation}}(In Spanish)</ref>\n\nDuring the 2018 season, the Eagles were renamed the Mexicas. In March, the Mexicas generated controversy by refusing to play against the Dinos in Week 3, after a serious knee injury to wide receiver Mubalama Massimango that occurred in Week 1. The Mexicas claim the injury was not properly attended to by the LFA. Although the league recognized that there was an administrative problem with the medical expenses insurance policy, the Mexicas were punished for their actions. The LFA ruled the Dinos game as a forfeit by the Mexicas, and the Mexicas team was fined [[Mexican peso|Mex$]]657,820.00 (approximately [[U.S. dollar|US$]]32,000) for damages caused to the league, its TV partners, its press partners, the Dinos team, and the fans. Additional, the Mexicas would have to change their franchisee for the 2019 season. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://lfa.mx/lfa-fija-su-postura-respecto-al-seguro-de-gastos-medicos-de-los-jugadores/|title=LFA fixes its position regarding the medical expenses insurance of the players}}(In Spanish)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://maximoavance.com/2018/03/lfa-sanciona-mexicas-pero-evitan-rompimiento/|title=LFA sanctions Mexicas but avoid breaking}}(In Spanish)</ref>\n\nOn April 22, 2018, the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico was held on a neutral site for the first time, at [[Estadio Azul]]. Originally a half-time show was planned, but the band canceled due to recommendation of Civil Protection force. Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico III featured the Mexicas and the Raptors, with the Mexicas winning their first title by a shutout of 17-0.\n\nIn November 2018, the LFA signed a non-binding Letter of Intent with the [[Canadian Football League]] to share resources and to allow for at least one CFL game to be played in Mexico<ref>{{cite web|url=https://toronto.citynews.ca/2018/11/23/cfl-lfa-sign-letter-of-intent-to-grow-football-in-canada-and-mexico|accessdate=2018-11-23|title=CFL, LFA sign letter of intent to grow football in Canada and Mexico}}(In Spanish)</ref>. CFL commissioner Randy Ambroise said of the deal later that he hopes it'll raise the level of competition in the LFA and give Canadian football players another competition to compete in if they get dropped from the CFL. \"For so many, if they finish their junior career or college career and they\u2019re not on a CFL roster then there\u2019s kind of nowhere to go and their dream ends, I think that\u2019s a tragedy. This is really about growing the game of football.\" The CFL later held a draft in January 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/football/cfl/cfl-holds-combine-mexico-city-effort-grow-football-worldwide/|title=CFL holds combine in Mexico City in effort to grow football worldwide - Sportsnet.ca|website=www.sportsnet.ca|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref>\n\nThe LFA considered expanding to 10 teams for the 2019 season, with Guadalajara, Puebla, Queretaro and even Tamaulipas among the four possible expansion candidates.<ref>http://lfa.mx/la-lfa-tendra-diez-equipos-para-2019/#comment-70</ref> However, the league only added two additional franchises: the [[Osos Toluca]] (Bears) and the [[Artilleros Puebla]] (Artillerymen).

The newest addition was the Pioneros from the city of Queretaro. This was an existing team which previously was a part of the Mexican Football League (FAM) where they were crowned champions in their first season. The Pioneros will play their games at the La Pir\u00e1mide Stadium, which is located in the El Pueblito Sports Unit, in the municipality of Corregidora. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://rotativo.com.mx/2019/09/04/deportes/pioneros-de-queretaro-se-une-a-lfa-para-temporada-2020-792277/|title=Pioneers of Quer\u00e9taro joins LFA for the 2020 season}}(In Spanish)</ref> But with only one new expansion team, the league had an unbalanced amount of teams, presenting difficulty for scheduling.

Some of the most notable rules are the [[Replay review in gridiron football|instant replay reviews]], the [[two-minute warning]], the ''coach's challenge'', and the requirement that receivers must have both feet touch the ground in bounds to complete a reception. However, the league has been criticized for not providing adequate refereeing, and it is common for some rules of NCAA football to be applied randomly in games, causing confusion among fans, players, and coaches.\n\n===Salary Cap===\nLike the NFL, the LFA has a salary cap.With the intention of maintaining sports balance, the League has a salary cap that prevents teams from differentiating each other in terms of the level of players they hire. The salary cap is $ 2,000,000 MXN , approximately $ 100,000 USD . There are four salary levels, each of which is determined by the League and is invariable for any team:\n\n*Level 1: foreign players, 5 for each team and 2 Canadians, have the highest salary and bonuses for housing and food.\n*Level 2: franchise players, an offensive and a defensive, must be Mexican and have the second best salary.\n*Level 3: starters, 17 to 20 per team, have a lower salary than level 2.\n*Level 4: depth chart players receive a symbolic bonus.\n*Level 5: practice squad players receive a bonus only if they get to play.\n\n==Season Format==\n===Draft===\nPlayers must have finished their eligibility in college football before playing professionally. Currently, there are two collegiate leagues, the ''Liga Mayor ONEFA'' and the ''Liga Premier CONADEIP''. In these leagues, each player can play five or six years, after which they become eligible for the LFA (they can also declare themselves eligible before finishing their period in college, but it is not usual).\n\nPlayers coming from college football should express their interest in being hired by the LFA. The LFA gives the list of interested players to their teams and they are classified according to the positions they need and the level of each of the players.\n\nEach year in January, interested players and LFA teams meet in a one-day player draft. Each team can choose a player in each of the seven rounds of the draft. The draft order is determined by each teams record from the previous year; the team that finished with the worst record has the first draft pick, the team with the second worst record has the next pick, and so on. Once all the teams have made their first selection, one round ends and the second begins, until the seventh and final round. There are also complementary rounds in case any team still requires players. The best players are very coveted, so being selected in the first round is considered a great honor, especially if it is the very first selection overall.\n\n===Regular Season===\nThe regular season consists of 10 games: 6 divisional games (home and away series) and 4 interdivisional games (two away and two home). The season starts on the third weekend of February and ends in April.\n\n===Post Season===\nAt the end of the regular season, a direct elimination tournament called postseason or playoffs begins, in which the two best teams of each division face each other in the Division Championship in the home stadium of the team with the better record. The postseason occurs between April and May. The winners of these games go to the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico bowl.\n\n<center>\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ForestGreen; color:white\" | Central Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|''' [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Mexicas CDMX|Mexicas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2018)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Condors CDMX|Condors]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2019)''</center>\n|}\n|width=\"100\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#d63334; color:white\" | North Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|'''[[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]]'''\n| <center>2 ''(2018, 2019)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Dinos Saltillo|Dinos]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|}\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico===\n[[File:Lfa tazon mexico.png|100px|right|thumb|Tazon M\u00e9xico trophy]]\nThe [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (English: ''Mexico Bowl'') is the title game for the LFA that determines the National Champion. The champions of the North Division and the Central Division meet in a neutral stadium. Each edition of the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico is designated with consecutive Roman numerals, similar to the [[Super Bowl]]. In certain editions, the name of a company has been added for sponsorship reasons. It is expected that in the future the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico will have a [[halftime show]].\nThe team with the most championships in the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico is [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]] with two. The team with the most appearances in this event is [[Raptors Edomex|Raptors]] with three. The current champion is the Condors, who defeated the Raptors in Tazon Mexico IV by 20-16 at the [[Estadio Azul]] in [[Mexico City]].\n\n====Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico Champions====\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"2\"\n|-\n!Season!!Champion!!Score!!Runner Up!!Winner head coach!!MVP\n|-\n|align=center|2016||[[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]]||align=center|29\u201313||[[Raptors Edomex|Raptors]]||Ernesto Alfaro||Josu\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez (WR)\n|- \t\n|align=center|2017||[[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]]||align=center|24\u201318||[[Dinos Saltillo|Dinos]]||Ernesto Alfaro||Marco Garc\u00eda (QB)\n|-\n|align=center|2018||[[Mexicas CDMX|Mexicas]]||align=center|17\u20130||[[Raptors Edomex|Raptors]]||Rafael Duk||[[Guillermo Villalobos]] (WR)\n|-\n|align=center|2019||[[Condors CDMX|Condors]]||align=center|20\u201316||[[Raptors Edomex|Raptors]]||F\u00e9lix Buend\u00eda||Diego P\u00e9rez Arvizu (QB)\n|}\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n* [[International Federation of American Football]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.lfa.mx/ Official site]\n* [http://fmfamericano.org.mx/ Mexican Federation of American Football]\n* [http://ifaf.org/ International Federation of American Football]\n\n\n{{Navboxes\n| titlestyle =\n| list1 =\n{{Liga de F\u00fatbol Americano Profesional}}\n{{Professional gridiron football leagues in North America}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:LFA}}\n[[Category:American football in Mexico|*]]\n[[Category:Sports leagues in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Sports leagues established in 2016]]\n[[Category:2016 establishments in Mexico]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Semi-pro American football league in Mexico}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2016}}\n{{Infobox sports league\n| title = Professional American Football League\n| current_season = 2020 LFA season\n| logo = LFA logo.png\n| pixels = 60px\n| sport = American football\n| founded = {{start date and age|2016|01|12}}\n| director        = Alejandro Jaimes\n| headquarters = [[Mexico City]], Mexico\n| teams = [[Liga de F\u00fatbol Americano Profesional de M\u00e9xico#Current teams|9]]\n| country = [[Mexico]]\n| champion = [[Condors CDMX|Condors]]<br>(1st title)\n| most_champs = [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]] (2 titles)\n| website = [http://lfa.mx/ LFA.mx]\n| TV = [[Canal Catorce]]<br>[[Claro (company)|Claro]]<br>[[Fox Sports (Latin America)|Fox Sports]]<br>[[Grupo Imagen]]<ref>includes [[Imagen Televisi\u00f3n]]</ref><br>[[Grupo Multimedios|Multimedios]]<ref>includes [[Multimedios Televisi\u00f3n]]</ref><br>M\u00e1ximo Avance<br>[[Televisa]]<ref>Includes [[Televisa Deportes Network|TDN]]</ref><br>[[TV Azteca]]<ref>Includes [[a+ (television channel)|a+]]</ref><br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Nuestra Visi\u00f3n]]\n}}\n\nThe '''{{Lang-es|Liga de F\u00fatbol Americano Profesional|label=none}}''' (''Professional American Football League'', '''LFA''') is a professional [[American football]] spring [[Sports league|league]] in [[Mexico]], founded in 2016. Starting with four teams, the LFA has since expanded to eight members as of 2019. The championship game is called [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), and it is currently played on the second Sunday in May. The players are drafted from the country's two [[college football]] conferences: [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]] and [[Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Deportiva Estudiantil de Instituciones Privadas|CONADEIP]].\n\n== History ==\nAmerican football has been played in Mexico since the 1920s and is the fourth most popular sport in the country. The LFA was the brainchild of Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez, a former [[Fox Sports Latin America|Fox Sports]] commentator. V\u00e1zquez was a huge fan of the previous American football league in Mexico called Liga Master, and he had always dreamed of creating his own league. In 2015, V\u00e1zquez (along with Edgar Zapata) managed to put together a group of investors who decided to offer football while the [[NFL]], [[NCAA]], [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]], and CONADEIP are in the offseason and founded the LFA, which would start two weeks after [[Super Bowl 50]]. The LFA would be the first American football league in Mexico in 20 years.<ref>https://weexpats.com/mexican-league-playing-american-football-meet-lfa/</ref>\n\nFour charter members participated in the inaugural 2016 season: the [[Mexicas CDMX|Eagles]], the [[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]], the [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]], and the [[Condors CDMX|Condors]]. All teams were based in [[Mexico City]]. The first game was played February 21, 2016, between the Raptors and the Mayas, with the Mayas winning the game 34-6. The first title game, the [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), was held on April 10, 2016 between the Mayas and the Raptors. The Mayas won Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico I, 29-13. All games were played at the [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Palillo Mart\u00ednez Stadium]] of [[Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City]]. The LFA experienced significant financial problems during 2016, with a season average attendance of only 2,000 per game.  \n\nDespite the financial difficulties of 2016, the LFA expanded to six teams in 2017, with the addition of [[Dinos Saltillo]] (short for \"dinosaurios\", the Spanish word for dinosaurs) and [[Fundidores Monterrey]] (Spanish for smelters or founders), who took players from the college programs in the ONEFA and CONADEIP. Due to the difficulty of travel, the Dinos nearly canceled going to Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/new_site/articulo/dino-a-los-maltratos|title=Dino to the abuse}} Z\u00f3calo(In Spanish)</ref> In the end, the game was played on April 30, 2017 at [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"]] between the Mayas and the Dinos. The Mayas maintained dominance over the league and won the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico for the second time, 24-18.\n\nOn October 28, 2017,  Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez left the presidency of the LFA. The title of President was eliminated and the position of the Commissioner was created, which was occupied by Guillermo Ruiz Burguete<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasillarota.com/deportes/para-su-tercera-temporada-lfa-tendra-nueva-cara-lfa-condors-mayas-fundidores/196862|title=For its third season, LFA will have a new face}}</ref> On January 16, the newly appointed LFA commissioner, Guillermo Ruiz Burguete, resigned. The league did not announce his replacement. For operational purposes, the activities of the commissioner were absorbed by the president of the board of directors of the league, \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasillarota.com/deportes/renuncia-comisionado-lfa-guillermo-ruiz-burguete-lfa-burguete-comisionado/200234|title=LFA commissioner resignation}}(In Spanish)</ref>\n\nDuring the 2018 season, the Eagles were renamed the Mexicas. In March, the Mexicas generated controversy by refusing to play against the Dinos in Week 3, after a serious knee injury to wide receiver Mubalama Massimango that occurred in Week 1. The Mexicas claim the injury was not properly attended to by the LFA. Although the league recognized that there was an administrative problem with the medical expenses insurance policy, the Mexicas were punished for their actions. The LFA ruled the Dinos game as a forfeit by the Mexicas, and the Mexicas team was fined [[Mexican peso|Mex$]]657,820.00 (approximately [[U.S. dollar|US$]]32,000) for damages caused to the league, its TV partners, its press partners, the Dinos team, and the fans. Additional, the Mexicas would have to change their franchisee for the 2019 season. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://lfa.mx/lfa-fija-su-postura-respecto-al-seguro-de-gastos-medicos-de-los-jugadores/|title=LFA fixes its position regarding the medical expenses insurance of the players}}(In Spanish)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://maximoavance.com/2018/03/lfa-sanciona-mexicas-pero-evitan-rompimiento/|title=LFA sanctions Mexicas but avoid breaking}}(In Spanish)</ref>\n\nOn April 22, 2018, the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico was held on a neutral site for the first time, at [[Estadio Azul]]. Originally a half-time show was planned, but the band canceled due to recommendation of Civil Protection force. Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico III featured the Mexicas and the Raptors, with the Mexicas winning their first title by a shutout of 17-0.\n\nIn November 2018, the LFA signed a non-binding Letter of Intent with the [[Canadian Football League]] to share resources and to allow for at least one CFL game to be played in Mexico<ref>{{cite web|url=https://toronto.citynews.ca/2018/11/23/cfl-lfa-sign-letter-of-intent-to-grow-football-in-canada-and-mexico|accessdate=2018-11-23|title=CFL, LFA sign letter of intent to grow football in Canada and Mexico}}(In Spanish)</ref>. CFL commissioner Randy Ambroise said of the deal later that he hopes it'll raise the level of competition in the LFA and give Canadian football players another competition to compete in if they get dropped from the CFL. \"For so many, if they finish their junior career or college career and they\u2019re not on a CFL roster then there\u2019s kind of nowhere to go and their dream ends, I think that\u2019s a tragedy. This is really about growing the game of football.\" The CFL later held a draft in January 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/football/cfl/cfl-holds-combine-mexico-city-effort-grow-football-worldwide/|title=CFL holds combine in Mexico City in effort to grow football worldwide - Sportsnet.ca|website=www.sportsnet.ca|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref>\n\nThe LFA considered expanding to 10 teams for the 2019 season, with Guadalajara, Puebla, Queretaro and even Tamaulipas among the four possible expansion candidates.<ref>http://lfa.mx/la-lfa-tendra-diez-equipos-para-2019/#comment-70</ref> However, the league only added two additional franchises: the [[Osos Toluca]] (Bears) and the [[Artilleros Puebla]] (Artillerymen).

The newest addition was the Pioneros from the city of Queretaro. This was an existing team which previously was a part of the Mexican Football League (FAM) where they were crowned champions in their first season. The Pioneros will play their games at the La Pir\u00e1mide Stadium, which is located in the El Pueblito Sports Unit, in the municipality of Corregidora. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://rotativo.com.mx/2019/09/04/deportes/pioneros-de-queretaro-se-une-a-lfa-para-temporada-2020-792277/|title=Pioneers of Quer\u00e9taro joins LFA for the 2020 season}}(In Spanish)</ref> But with only one new expansion team, the league had an unbalanced amount of teams, presenting difficulty for scheduling.

Some of the most notable rules are the [[Replay review in gridiron football|instant replay reviews]], the [[two-minute warning]], the ''coach's challenge'', and the requirement that receivers must have both feet touch the ground in bounds to complete a reception. However, the league has been criticized for not providing adequate refereeing, and it is common for some rules of NCAA football to be applied randomly in games, causing confusion among fans, players, and coaches.\n\n===Salary Cap===\nLike the NFL, the LFA has a salary cap.With the intention of maintaining sports balance, the League has a salary cap that prevents teams from differentiating each other in terms of the level of players they hire. The salary cap is $ 2,000,000 MXN , approximately $ 100,000 USD . There are four salary levels, each of which is determined by the League and is invariable for any team:\n\n*Level 1: foreign players, 5 for each team and 2 Canadians, have the highest salary and bonuses for housing and food.\n*Level 2: franchise players, an offensive and a defensive, must be Mexican and have the second best salary.\n*Level 3: starters, 17 to 20 per team, have a lower salary than level 2.\n*Level 4: depth chart players receive a symbolic bonus.\n*Level 5: practice squad players receive a bonus only if they get to play.\n\n==Season Format==\n===Draft===\nPlayers must have finished their eligibility in college football before playing professionally. Currently, there are two collegiate leagues, the ''Liga Mayor ONEFA'' and the ''Liga Premier CONADEIP''. In these leagues, each player can play five or six years, after which they become eligible for the LFA (they can also declare themselves eligible before finishing their period in college, but it is not usual).\n\nPlayers coming from college football should express their interest in being hired by the LFA. The LFA gives the list of interested players to their teams and they are classified according to the positions they need and the level of each of the players.\n\nEach year in January, interested players and LFA teams meet in a one-day player draft. Each team can choose a player in each of the seven rounds of the draft. The draft order is determined by each teams record from the previous year; the team that finished with the worst record has the first draft pick, the team with the second worst record has the next pick, and so on. Once all the teams have made their first selection, one round ends and the second begins, until the seventh and final round. There are also complementary rounds in case any team still requires players. The best players are very coveted, so being selected in the first round is considered a great honor, especially if it is the very first selection overall.\n\n===Regular Season===\nThe regular season consists of 10 games: 6 divisional games (home and away series) and 4 interdivisional games (two away and two home). The season starts on the third weekend of February and ends in April.\n\n===Post Season===\nAt the end of the regular season, a direct elimination tournament called postseason or playoffs begins, in which the two best teams of each division face each other in the Division Championship in the home stadium of the team with the better record. The postseason occurs between April and May. The winners of these games go to the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico bowl.\n\n<center>\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ForestGreen; color:white\" | Central Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|''' [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Mexicas CDMX|Mexicas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2018)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Condors CDMX|Condors]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2019)''</center>\n|}\n|width=\"100\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#d63334; color:white\" | North Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|'''[[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]]'''\n| <center>2 ''(2018, 2019)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Dinos Saltillo|Dinos]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|}\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico===\n[[File:Lfa tazon mexico.png|100px|right|thumb|Tazon M\u00e9xico trophy]]\nThe [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (English: ''Mexico Bowl'') is the title game for the LFA that determines the National Champion.

{"title_page": "Future of the Royal Navy", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Royal Navy}}\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s the [[Royal Navy]] was a force designed for the [[Cold War]]. The main purpose of its fleet, based around three small [[aircraft carrier]]s and a force of [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] [[frigate]]s and [[destroyer]]s, was to search for, and destroy if required, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet submarines]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. The 1982 [[Falklands War]] also demonstrated a requirement for the Royal Navy to maintain a [[Blue-water navy|global reach]] and [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary capability]].\n\nSince the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Royal Navy has been used to meet a wider range of objectives around the world, while experiencing a gradual reduction in the size of its surface and submarine fleets. Fixed-wing carrier operations ceased in 2010 with the retirement of the last [[BAE Harrier II|Harrier GR7/GR9]] aircraft. This capability has since been restored by the addition of the [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35]] [[Joint Combat Aircraft]] and the first {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|aircraft carrier|1}} which became operational in 2019. Cuts have also seen the sale of three [[Type 23 frigate]]s in 2005 and 2006, and the early decommissioning of four [[Type 22 frigate]]s in 2010 and 2011.\n\nOver the course of the 1990s and the 2000s, the Navy began a series of projects to improve its fleet, with a view to providing enhanced capabilities, although many programmes were reduced in scale. This led to the replacement of smaller and more numerous units with fewer, but larger, units. The main examples of this are the replacement of twelve [[Type 42 destroyer]]s with six [[Type 45 destroyer]]s and the replacement of the three 20,000-tonne {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s with two 65,000-tonne ''Queen Elizabeth''-class aircraft carriers.\n\nAs of October 2019, the following are under construction or being laid down; \n*the final three of seven {{sclass-|Astute|submarine|1}}s, \n*the first of four [[Dreadnought-class submarine|''Dreadnought''-class]] ballistic missile submarines, \n*the first two of eight [[Type 26 frigate]]s and \n*the ninth of nine [[River-class patrol vessel|River-class ocean-going patrol vessels]]. \n\nIn addition, early design and preparation work has begun for a fleet of at least five [[Type 31 frigate]]s.\n\nParliament's National Audit Office (NAO) has described the Ministry of Defence's current equipment plan as \"unaffordable\". With respect to the 2019 to 2029 period, the NAO has noted that the Royal Navy has allocated no funding to replace certain key capabilities, specifically referencing the Royal Fleet Auxiliary hospital ship RFA Argus and the Royal Navy's mine countermeasures capability as examples. <ref>https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Equipment-Plan-2019-to-2029.pdf</ref> These issues are planned to be addressed in the pending integrated foreign policy, security, defence and international development review which had been anticipated in 2020 but, due to Covid-19, is likely to be deferred for at least a year. <ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-outlines-new-review-to-define-britains-place-in-the-world</ref><ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/mostly-business-as-usual-for-the-royal-navy-in-the-face-of-covid-19-crisis/</ref>\n\n==Ships under construction==\n\n===Royal Navy===\nThe following is a list of vessels planned, ordered, under construction or undergoing sea trials within the United Kingdom, and destined for the Royal Navy:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:center; width:18%;\"|Class\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\"|Ship\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"|Pennant No.\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:18%;\"|Builders\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\"|Displacement \n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"|Homeport\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:8%;\"|Commissioning\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |{{sclass-|River|patrol vessel|4}}\n| [[HMS Trent (P224)|''Trent'']] || P224 || rowspan=3|BAE Systems, Glasgow || rowspan=3|2,000 tonnes || rowspan=3|Offshore patrol vessel || rowspan=3|Portsmouth || Expected 2020<ref name=\"River class\">{{cite web|url=https://www.adsadvance.co.uk/royal-navy-s-final-opv-named-hms-spey.html||work=ADS Advance|title=Royal Navy's final OPV named HMS Spey|date=7 October 2019|accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref>\n|- \n| [[HMS Tamar (P233)|''Tamar'']] || P233 || Expected 2020<ref name=\"River class\"/>\n|-\n| [[HMS Spey (P234)|''Spey'']] || P234 || Expected 2020<ref name=\"River class\"/>\n|- \n! rowspan=\"4\"| {{sclass-|Astute|submarine|4}}\n| {{HMS|Audacious|S122|2}} || S122 || rowspan=8|BAE Systems, Barrow-in-Furness || rowspan=4|7,400 tonnes || rowspan=4|Fleet submarine || rowspan=4|Clyde || Expected 2021<ref name=\"Delivery\">{{cite web|url=https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/delivery-of-hms-audacious-to-the-royal-navy-delayed-by-another-17-months/|title=Delivery of HMS Audacious to the Royal Navy delayed by another 17 months|date=23 October 2019|accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n| {{HMS|Anson|S123|2}} || S123 || TBC <ref name=\"Delivery\"/>\n|- \n| {{HMS|Agamemnon|S124|2}} || S124 || TBC <ref name=\"Delivery\"/>\n|- \n| {{HMS|Agincourt|S125|2}} || S125 || Expected 2026<ref>https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2020-01-30.10350.h&s=c</ref> \n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\"| {{sclass-|Dreadnought|submarine|4}}\n| ''Dreadnought'' ||  || rowspan=4|17,200 tonnes || rowspan=4|Ballistic missile submarine || rowspan=4|Clyde || Expected early 2030s<ref>https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2020-01-30.10350.h&s=c</ref> \n|-\n| ''Valiant'' ||  ||  TBC\n|-\n| ''Warspite'' ||  ||  TBC\n|-\n| ''King George VI'' ||  ||  TBC\n|-\n! rowspan=\"8\" | [[Type 26 frigate|Type 26]]\n| [[HMS Glasgow (Type 26 frigate)|''Glasgow'']] ||  ||rowspan=8| BAE Systems, Glasgow ||rowspan=8| 6,900 tonnes ||rowspan=8| Anti-submarine frigate ||rowspan=8| Devonport|| Expected 2026/27<ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/only-seven-years-to-wait-until-the-royal-navy-gets-a-new-frigate/</ref>\n|-\n| ''Cardiff'' ||  || rowspan=7| TBC\n|-\n| ''Belfast'' ||\n|-\n| ''Birmingham'' || \n|-\n| ''Sheffield'' || \n|-\n| ''Newcastle'' || \n|-\n| ''Edinburgh'' ||\n|-\n| ''London'' || \n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" | [[Type 31 frigate|Type 31]]\n| ''TBC'' ||  ||rowspan=5| Babcock International, Rosyth ||rowspan=5| 5,700 tonnes ||rowspan=5| General-purpose frigate ||rowspan=5| || Expected 2026/27<ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/tag/type-31-frigate/</ref><ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/only-seven-years-to-wait-until-the-royal-navy-gets-a-new-frigate/</ref>\n|-\n| ''TBC'' ||  || rowspan=4| TBC\n|-\n| ''TBC'' ||\n|-\n| ''TBC'' || \n|-\n| ''TBC'' || \n|}\n* {{small|''Note: \"[[TBC]]\" means \"[[wikt:TBC|to be confirmed]]\"''}}\n\n==Ships==\n\n===Type 26 and Type 31 frigates===\n{{main|Type 26 frigate|Type 31 frigate}}\n\nIn the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review]] a replacement programme was authorized for the Navy's fleet of thirteen [[Type 23 frigate]]s. In 2012, [[BAE Systems Naval Ships]] was awarded a contract to design the replacement, known as the [[Global Combat Ship|Type 26 Global Combat Ship (GCS)]]. It was planned that two variants of the class would be built: five general purpose frigates and eight anti-submarine warfare frigates. According to estimates as of 2020, the first Type 26 frigate is to commission in around 2026/27 and the last commissioning in around 2040, whilst the Type 23s are gradually phased out.<ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/only-seven-years-to-wait-until-the-royal-navy-gets-a-new-frigate/</ref> <ref>https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/naval-warfare/fleet-escort-cuts-impending-uks-frigate-maths-fail/</ref>Eight Type 26 frigates will be built initially.

The larger the air group, the more tasks it can perform. The ''Invincible'' class, because of its small size, had only a limited capacity, and was only capable of operating STOVL aircraft, the [[RAF Harrier II|Harrier GR7/GR9]]. In 2006 the [[Sea Harrier]] was withdrawn from service. This saw the front line Sea Harrier squadron of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] converting to the Harrier GR9, as part of the evolution of the [[Joint Force Harrier]] concept. The Harrier's replacement in both the RAF and the FAA is the [[F-35 Lightning II]] [[Joint Combat Aircraft]]. The F-35 is a significant improvement over the Harrier, in terms of speed, range and weapon load. The UK had plans to order 138 F-35Bs for the Royal Navy and [[Royal Air Force]]. The financial crisis led to the decision taken in the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010]] to immediately withdraw the Harrier GR9 force in late 2010 along with [[HMS Ark Royal (R07)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']], to reduce the total number of F-35s planned for purchase by the UK, and to purchase the F-35C [[CATOBAR]] version rather than the [[STOVL]] F-35B.

The main purpose of its fleet, based around three small [[aircraft carrier]]s and a force of [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] [[frigate]]s and [[destroyer]]s, was to search for, and destroy if required, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet submarines]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. The 1982 [[Falklands War]] also demonstrated a requirement for the Royal Navy to maintain a [[Blue-water navy|global reach]] and [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary capability]].\n\nSince the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Royal Navy has been used to meet a wider range of objectives around the world, while experiencing a gradual reduction in the size of its surface and submarine fleets. Fixed-wing carrier operations ceased in 2010 with the retirement of the last [[BAE Harrier II|Harrier GR7/GR9]] aircraft. This capability has since been restored by the addition of the [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35]] [[Joint Combat Aircraft]] and the first {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|aircraft carrier|1}} which became operational in 2019. Cuts have also seen the sale of three [[Type 23 frigate]]s in 2005 and 2006, and the early decommissioning of four [[Type 22 frigate]]s in 2010 and 2011.\n\nOver the course of the 1990s and the 2000s, the Navy began a series of projects to improve its fleet, with a view to providing enhanced capabilities, although many programmes were reduced in scale. This led to the replacement of smaller and more numerous units with fewer, but larger, units. The main examples of this are the replacement of twelve [[Type 42 destroyer]]s with six [[Type 45 destroyer]]s and the replacement of the three 20,000-tonne {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s with two 65,000-tonne ''Queen Elizabeth''-class aircraft carriers.\n\nAs of October 2019, the following are under construction or being laid down; \n*the final three of seven {{sclass-|Astute|submarine|1}}s, \n*the first of four [[Dreadnought-class submarine|''Dreadnought''-class]] ballistic missile submarines, \n*the first two of eight [[Type 26 frigate]]s and \n*the ninth of nine [[River-class patrol vessel|River-class ocean-going patrol vessels]]. \n\nIn addition, early design and preparation work has begun for a fleet of at least five [[Type 31 frigate]]s.\n\nParliament's National Audit Office (NAO) has described the Ministry of Defence's current equipment plan as \"unaffordable\". With respect to the 2019 to 2029 period, the NAO has noted that the Royal Navy has allocated no funding to replace certain key capabilities, specifically referencing the Royal Fleet Auxiliary hospital ship RFA Argus and the Royal Navy's mine countermeasures capability as examples. <ref>https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Equipment-Plan-2019-to-2029.pdf</ref> These issues are planned to be addressed in the pending integrated foreign policy, security, defence and international development review which had been anticipated in 2020 but, due to Covid-19, is likely to be deferred for at least a year. <ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-outlines-new-review-to-define-britains-place-in-the-world</ref><ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/mostly-business-as-usual-for-the-royal-navy-in-the-face-of-covid-19-crisis/</ref>\n\n==Ships under construction==\n\n===Royal Navy===\nThe following is a list of vessels planned, ordered, under construction or undergoing sea trials within the United Kingdom, and destined for the Royal Navy:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:center; width:18%;\"|Class\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\"|Ship\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"|Pennant No.\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:18%;\"|Builders\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\"|Displacement \n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"|Homeport\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:8%;\"|Commissioning\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |{{sclass-|River|patrol vessel|4}}\n| [[HMS Trent (P224)|''Trent'']] || P224 || rowspan=3|BAE Systems, Glasgow || rowspan=3|2,000 tonnes || rowspan=3|Offshore patrol vessel || rowspan=3|Portsmouth || Expected 2020<ref name=\"River class\">{{cite web|url=https://www.adsadvance.co.uk/royal-navy-s-final-opv-named-hms-spey.html||work=ADS Advance|title=Royal Navy's final OPV named HMS Spey|date=7 October 2019|accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref>\n|- \n| [[HMS Tamar (P233)|''Tamar'']] || P233 || Expected 2020<ref name=\"River class\"/>\n|-\n| [[HMS Spey (P234)|''Spey'']] || P234 || Expected 2020<ref name=\"River class\"/>\n|- \n! rowspan=\"4\"| {{sclass-|Astute|submarine|4}}\n| {{HMS|Audacious|S122|2}} || S122 || rowspan=8|BAE Systems, Barrow-in-Furness || rowspan=4|7,400 tonnes || rowspan=4|Fleet submarine || rowspan=4|Clyde || Expected 2021<ref name=\"Delivery\">{{cite web|url=https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/delivery-of-hms-audacious-to-the-royal-navy-delayed-by-another-17-months/|title=Delivery of HMS Audacious to the Royal Navy delayed by another 17 months|date=23 October 2019|accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n| {{HMS|Anson|S123|2}} || S123 || TBC <ref name=\"Delivery\"/>\n|- \n| {{HMS|Agamemnon|S124|2}} || S124 || TBC <ref name=\"Delivery\"/>\n|- \n| {{HMS|Agincourt|S125|2}} || S125 || Expected 2026<ref>https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2020-01-30.10350.h&s=c</ref> \n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\"| {{sclass-|Dreadnought|submarine|4}}\n| ''Dreadnought'' ||  || rowspan=4|17,200 tonnes || rowspan=4|Ballistic missile submarine || rowspan=4|Clyde || Expected early 2030s<ref>https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2020-01-30.10350.h&s=c</ref> \n|-\n| ''Valiant'' ||  ||  TBC\n|-\n| ''Warspite'' ||  ||  TBC\n|-\n| ''King George VI'' ||  ||  TBC\n|-\n! rowspan=\"8\" | [[Type 26 frigate|''City'' class]]\n| [[HMS Glasgow (Type 26 frigate)|''Glasgow'']] ||  ||rowspan=8| BAE Systems, Glasgow ||rowspan=8| 6,900 tonnes ||rowspan=8| Anti-submarine frigate ||rowspan=8| Devonport|| Expected 2026/27<ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/only-seven-years-to-wait-until-the-royal-navy-gets-a-new-frigate/</ref>\n|-\n| ''Cardiff'' ||  || rowspan=7| TBC\n|-\n| ''Belfast'' ||\n|-\n| ''Birmingham'' || \n|-\n| ''Sheffield'' || \n|-\n| ''Newcastle'' || \n|-\n| ''Edinburgh'' ||\n|-\n| ''London'' || \n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" | [[Type 31 frigate]]\n| ''TBC'' ||  ||rowspan=5| Babcock International, Rosyth ||rowspan=5| 5,700 tonnes ||rowspan=5| General-purpose frigate ||rowspan=5| || Expected 2026/27<ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/tag/type-31-frigate/</ref><ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/only-seven-years-to-wait-until-the-royal-navy-gets-a-new-frigate/</ref>\n|-\n| ''TBC'' ||  || rowspan=4| TBC\n|-\n| ''TBC'' ||\n|-\n| ''TBC'' || \n|-\n| ''TBC'' || \n|}\n* {{small|''Note: \"[[TBC]]\" means \"[[wikt:TBC|to be confirmed]]\"''}}\n\n==Ships==\n\n===Type 26 and Type 31 frigates===\n{{main|Type 26 frigate|Type 31 frigate}}\n\nIn the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review]] a replacement programme was authorized for the Navy's fleet of thirteen [[Type 23 frigate]]s. In 2012, [[BAE Systems Naval Ships]] was awarded a contract to design the replacement, known as the [[Global Combat Ship|Type 26 Global Combat Ship (GCS)]]. It was planned that two variants of the class would be built: five general purpose frigates and eight anti-submarine warfare frigates. According to estimates as of 2020, the first Type 26 frigate is to commission in around 2026/27 and the last commissioning in around 2040, whilst the Type 23s are gradually phased out.<ref>https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/only-seven-years-to-wait-until-the-royal-navy-gets-a-new-frigate/</ref> <ref>https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/naval-warfare/fleet-escort-cuts-impending-uks-frigate-maths-fail/</ref>Eight Type 26 frigates will be built initially.

The larger the air group, the more tasks it can perform. The ''Invincible'' class, because of its small size, had only a limited capacity, and was only capable of operating STOVL aircraft, the [[RAF Harrier II|Harrier GR7/GR9]]. In 2006 the [[Sea Harrier]] was withdrawn from service. This saw the front line Sea Harrier squadron of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] converting to the Harrier GR9, as part of the evolution of the [[Joint Force Harrier]] concept. The Harrier's replacement in both the RAF and the FAA is the [[F-35 Lightning II]] [[Joint Combat Aircraft]]. The F-35 is a significant improvement over the Harrier, in terms of speed, range and weapon load. The UK had plans to order 138 F-35Bs for the Royal Navy and [[Royal Air Force]]. The financial crisis led to the decision taken in the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010]] to immediately withdraw the Harrier GR9 force in late 2010 along with [[HMS Ark Royal (R07)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']], to reduce the total number of F-35s planned for purchase by the UK, and to purchase the F-35C [[CATOBAR]] version rather than the [[STOVL]] F-35B. By May 2012, the government had decided to purchase the short-take off version, the F-35B instead.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/09/government-u-turn-fighter-jets Government forced into U-turn on Royal Navy fighter jets], guardian.co.uk, 10 May 2012</ref> In July 2012, the Secretary of State for Defence stated that an initial 48 F-35Bs will be purchased to equip the carrier fleet.<ref>Hewson, Robert.

He was the seventh recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]]. It was Germany's highest military decoration at the time of its presentation to Joachim Schepke.{{sfn|Williamson|Bujeiro|2004|pp=3, 7}}\n\nSchepke is credited with the sinking of 36 Allied ships. During his career, he gained notoriety among fellow U-boat commanders for exaggerating the tonnage of ships sunk.\n\n==Career==\nSchepke was the son of a naval officer, and he joined the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' in 1930. In 1934, he was assigned to the newly created U-boat arm, and in 1938 he commanded {{GS|U-3|1935|2}}. At the outbreak of [[World War II]] he took ''U3'' to war against Allied shipping. After a short stint commanding {{GS|U-19|1936|2}} and serving in a staff position Schepke received the command of {{GS|U-100|1940|2}}, a [[German Type VII submarine|Type VIIb]] boat. After 5 patrols in ''U-100'' she was heavily damaged on 17 March 1941 by depth charges from HMS ''Walker'' and {{HMS|Vanoc|H33|2}} while executing an attack on [[Convoy HX-112]]. ''U-100'' was forced to surface and was detected on radar and consequently rammed by ''Vanoc''. Schepke and 37 crew members perished in the ocean; six crew members were rescued. Schepke was last reported on the bridge of ''U-100''. When ''Vanoc'' rammed his boat, he was crushed into his own periscope standards, and he went down with his boat.<ref>Macintyre, Donald ''U-boat Killer'', (Avon Publications, 1956)</ref>\n\nSchepke claimed to have sunk 37 ships, for a total of {{GRT|213,310|disp=long}} and damaged 4 more. If true, this would have made him the third skipper to have sunk over 200,000 tons. While he did positively sink 34 ships, he was known to Admiral D\u00f6nitz and throughout the fleet to exaggerate his tonnage claims; fellow U-boat men came to use the expression \"Schepke tonnage\" to reference them. Nonetheless, with 34 ships Schepke ranked first in number of ships sunk, and was recommended by D\u00f6nitz for Knight's cross with Oak Leaves for this achievement.{{sfn|Blair|1996|p=218}}\n\nSchepke, [[G\u00fcnther Prien]] and [[Otto Kretschmer]] were friendly rivals in the U-boat service, and were the most famous U-boat commanders in the early years of the war, where all except Kretschmer eventually met their ends. Schepke was the favorite of these three, because in contrast to Kretschmer he was a convinced Nazi. He wrote and illustrated the book \"U-Boot-Fahrer von heute\" (U-Boat Men of today) in 1940 (Berlin, Deutscher Verlag 1940). In February 1941 he made a speech in the [[Berlin Sportpalast]] for thousands of Berlin schoolchildren about the U-boat war. Before and after his death the German propaganda ministry held him as an example for German youth to follow.{{sfn|Hadley|1995|pp=81, 84, 112}}\n\n==Summary of career==\n\n===Ships attacked===\nAs commander of {{GS|U-3|1935|2}}, {{GS|U-19|1935|2}} and {{GS|U-100|1939|2}}, Schepke is credited with the sinking of 36 ships for a total of {{GRT|153,677|disp=long}}, further damaging four ships of

He was the seventh recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]]. It was Germany's highest military decoration at the time of its presentation to Joachim Schepke.{{sfn|Williamson|Bujeiro|2004|pp=3, 7}}\n\nSchepke is credited with the sinking of 36 Allied ships. During his career, he gained notoriety among fellow U-boat commanders for exaggerating the tonnage of ships sunk.\n\n==Career==\nSchepke was the son of a naval officer, and he joined the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' in 1930. In 1934, he was assigned to the newly created U-boat arm, and in 1938 he commanded {{GS|U-3|1935|2}}. At the outbreak of [[World War II]] he took ''U3'' to war against Allied shipping. After a short stint commanding {{GS|U-19|1936|2}} and serving in a staff position Schepke received the command of {{GS|U-100|1940|2}}, a [[German Type VII submarine|Type VIIb]] boat. After 5 patrols in ''U-100'' she was heavily damaged on 17 March 1941 by depth charges from HMS ''Walker'' and {{HMS|Vanoc|H33|2}} while executing an attack on [[Convoy HX-112]]. ''U-100'' was forced to surface and was detected on radar and consequently rammed by ''Vanoc''. Schepke and 37 crew members perished in the ocean; six crew members were rescued. Schepke was last reported on the bridge of ''U-100''. When ''Vanoc'' rammed his boat, he was crushed into his own periscope standards, and he went down with his boat.<ref>Macintyre, Donald ''U-boat Killer'', (Avon Publications, 1956)</ref>\n\nSchepke claimed to have sunk 37 ships, for a total of {{GRT|213,310|disp=long}} and damaged 4 more. If true, this would have made him the third skipper to have sunk over 200,000 tons. While he did positively sink 34 ships, he was known to Admiral D\u00f6nitz and throughout the fleet to exaggerate his tonnage claims; fellow U-boat men came to use the expression \"Schepke tonnage\" to reference them. Nonetheless, with 34 ships Schepke ranked first in number of ships sunk, and was recommended by D\u00f6nitz for Knight's cross with Oak Leaves for this achievement.{{sfn|Blair|1996|p=218}}\n\nSchepke, [[G\u00fcnther Prien]] and [[Otto Kretschmer]] were friendly rivals in the U-boat service, and were the most famous U-boat commanders in the early years of the war, where all except Kretschmer eventually met their ends. Schepke was the favorite of these three, because in contrast to Kretschmer he was a convinced Nazi. He wrote and illustrated the book \"U-Boot-Fahrer von heute\" (U-Boat Men of today) in 1940 (Berlin, Deutscher Verlag 1940). In February 1941 he made a speech in the [[Berlin Sportpalast]] for thousands of Berlin schoolchildren about the U-boat war. Before and after his death the German propaganda ministry held him as an example for German youth to follow.{{sfn|Hadley|1995|pp=81, 84, 112}}\n\n==Summary of career==\n\n===Ships attacked===\nAs commander of {{GS|U-3|1935|2}}, {{GS|U-19|1935|2}} and {{GS|U-100|1939|2}}, Schepke is credited with the sinking of 36 ships for a total of {{GRT|153,677|disp=long}}, further damaging four ships of {{GRT|17,229}} and additionally damaging one more ship so heavily that it was a total loss of {{GRT|2,205}}.\n{{Clear}}\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right; margin: 1em
