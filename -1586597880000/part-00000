{"title_page": "Entryism", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2008}}\n{{Original research|date=May 2008}}\n}}\n\n'''Entryism''' (also spelled '''entrism''' or '''enterism''' or called '''infiltration''') is a [[political strategy]] in which an organisation or state encourages its members or supporters to join another, usually larger, organisation in an attempt to expand influence and expand their ideas and program. If the organizaion being \"entered\" is hostile to entrism, the entrists may engage in a degree of subterfuge and [[subversion]] to hide the fact that they are an organization in their own right.\n\n==Definitions==\nHorton (2014) gives the \"example of entryism \u2013 the infiltration of a self-proclaimed human rights activist into an institution committed to neoliberalism, a market fundamentalism that has been credited with eroding health systems in dozens of low and middle-income countries.\"<ref>Horton, Richard (2014) Offline: the Kim Doctrine ''[[The Lancet]]'', Sep 6, 2014, Vol.384(9946), p.840</ref> Leslie (1999) uses the example of gender: \"alternative, yet complementary, strategies of 'entryism', with attempts to enter and transform these institutions' gender inequalities from within (as missionaries).\"<ref>Leslie, A. (1999). Missionaries and Mandarins. ''[[United Nations Chronicle]]'', 36(2), 82-83.</ref>\n\n==Socialist entryism==\n===Trotsky's \"French Turn\"===\nThe \"[[French Turn]]\" refers to the classic form of entrism advocated by [[Leon Trotsky]] in his essays on \"The French Turn\". In June 1934, he proposed for the French Trotskyists to dissolve their Communist League and to join the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) and for the Communist League to dissolve its youth section to join more easily with revolutionary elements. The tactic was adopted in August 1934, despite some opposition, and successfully raised the group's membership to 300 activists.\n\nProponents of the tactic advocated that the Trotskyists should enter the [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties to connect with revolutionary socialist currents within them and then to steer those currents toward [[Leninism]]. However, entryism lasted briefly since the leadership of the SFIO started to expel the Trotskyists. The Trotskyists of the [[Workers Party of the United States]] also successfully used their entry into the [[Socialist Party of America]] to recruit their youth group and other members. Similar tactics were also used by Trotskyist organisations in other countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Poland. Entryism was used to connect with and recruit leftward-moving political currents inside radical parties.\n\nSince it was used in France, Marxists have used the tactic even if they had different preconceptions of how long the period of entry would last:\n* A \"split perspective\" is sometimes employed in which the smaller party intends to remain in the larger party for a short period of time, with the intention of splitting the organisation and leaving with more members than it began with.\n* The entrist tactic can work successfully, in its own terms, over a long period. For example, it was attempted by the [[Militant tendency]] in the [[United Kingdom]], whose members worked within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from the 1950s onward and managed to get control in the [[Labour Party Young Socialists]] and [[Liverpool City Council]] before it was expelled in the 1980s. Many other Trotskyist groups have attempted similar feats, but few have gained the influence that the Militant tendancy attained (See Militant's [http://www.marxist.net/openturn/historic/index.html Problems of Entrism] pamphlet).\n\n===Deep entryism ''sui generis''{{anchor|Deep entrism|Deep entryism|Entrism sui generis|Entryism sui generis}}===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nIn these types of entryism, activists engage in a long-term perspective in which they work within an organisation for decades in the hope of gaining influence and a degree of power and perhaps even control of the larger organisation.\n\nIn entryism ''[[sui generis]]'' (\"of a special type\"), Trotskyists, for example, do not openly argue for the building of a Trotskyist party. \"Deep entryism\" refers to the long duration.\n\nThe tactic is closely identified with [[Michel Pablo]] and [[Gerry Healy]], who were leaders of the [[Fourth International]] in the late 1940s and the 1950s. The \"deep entry\" tactic was developed as a way for Trotskyists to respond to the [[Cold War]]. In countries with mass social democratic or communist parties, it was as difficult to be accepted into these parties as it was Trotskyist currents as to build separate Trotskyist parties. Therefore, Trotskyists were advised to join the mass party.\n\nIn Europe, that was the approach used, for example, by [[The Club (Trotskyist)|The Club]] and later [[Socialist Action (UK)|Socialist Action]] in the Labour Party,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11893986/Jeremy-Corbyns-top-team-encouraged-street-riots.html |title=Jeremy Corbyn's top team encouraged street riots |last=Gilligan |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Gilligan |date=26 September 2015 |website=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |access-date=2 April 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404121300/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11893986/Jeremy-Corbyns-top-team-encouraged-street-riots.html |archivedate=4 April 2018}}</ref> and by Fourth Internationalists inside the Communist Parties. In [[France]], Trotskyist organizations, most notably the ''[[Workers' Party (France)|Parti des Travailleurs]]'' and its predecessors, have successfully entered [[trade union]]s and mainstream [[left-wing]] parties.\n\n===Open entryism===\n{{See also|Platform (European politics)}}\nSome political parties, such as the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party in Brazil]] or the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], allow political tendencies to organise within them openly. In those cases, the term \"entryism\" is not usually used. Political groups that work within a larger organisation but also maintain a \"public face\" often reject the term \"entrism\" but are sometimes still considered to be entryists by the larger organization.\n\n==Examples by country==\n\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australia]], the practice was widespread during the 1950s, when the [[Communist Party of Australia]] battled against right-wing [[Industrial Groups]] for control of Australian [[trade unions]]. The 'Groupers' subsequently formed the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]]. Today, the practice in Australia is often known as a type of [[branch stacking]].\n\nIn recent times, [[RSPCA Australia]] has been described as being the victims of the practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1137257.htm|title=A Blind Eye\", ABC Four Corners|date=21 June 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810215129/http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1137257.htm|archivedate=10 August 2011}}</ref> The [[National Farmers' Federation]] and [[Animals Australia]] have each been accused of infiltrating branches RSPCA Australia in an attempt to promote opposing policies concerning [[battery hens]], [[intensive pig farming]], and the [[live export]] of sheep.\n\nSince the 2000s, the [[religious right]] has practiced entryism into a number of state branches of the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], notably in New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/whos-behind-the-safe-school-videos-the-concerned-mums-political-connections-20170811-gxukuu.html|title=Who's behind the Safe School videos?

While opponents pointed to the remarkable distance, Orchard and his supporters argued that they represented \"traditional\" Conservative values and the [[economic nationalism]] of the older [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] and the Progressive Conservative Party had espoused before Mulroney, namely under [[John Diefenbaker]].\n\nOpponents of the 2003 merger between the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance also charged Alliance members with infiltration. It was widely speculated that most, if not all, of the approximately 25,000 Canadians who swelled the Progressive Conservative Party Party's membership before the merger vote were Alliance members, who likely voted in favour of the merger.\n\n[[Liberals for Life]], a [[pro-life]] group allied with the [[Campaign Life Coalition]], was accused of infiltrating the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in the late 1980s and the early 1990s.\n\nMembers of [[Socialist Action (Canada)|Socialist Action]], a small Trotskyist group, play a leading role in the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] [[New Democratic Party Socialist Caucus|Socialist Caucus]], a small faction on the left wing of the [[social democracy|social democratic]] NDP, and advocate that their members join and engage with the NDP. That, however, does not fit with most definitions of entryism because of its continued existence apart and separate from the NDP, in addition to its work in it. [[Fightback (Canada)|Fightback]], a rival Trotskyist organization, carries out a more classical form of entryism in the NDP, particularly in its youth wings, and models itself after the British [[Militant tendency]], which practiced entryism into the Labour Party and, at its peak, was the one of the most successful entryist organizations on record.\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Social Credit Party of British Columbia]], the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] saw the shift by the joining of former Social Credit members.  As a result, the new membership saw the party shift much more towards the right in fiscal policy. Thus, entryism led to a complete takeover of the original party by former Social Credit members. That, however, is not formal entryism since former Social Credit members did not operate their own organization within the Liberal Party.\n\n===China===\nDuring the [[Warlord Era]] in China, the [[Communist Party of China]] joined the party of the [[Nationalist Party of China]] for a time (1923\u20131927), creating the [[First United Front]] against warlordism, but one of the Communists' ideas behind doing so was the possibility of eventually gaining a majority in the Nationalist Party and shaping its policies. Eventually, the situation degraded, the Nationalists expelled the Communists from their party, and the [[Chinese Civil War]] began. The war was paused for a time (1936\u20131945) to allow for a [[Second United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Chinese resistance to Japanese imperial rule]].

If the organizaion being \"entered\" is hostile to entrism, the entrists may engage in a degree of subterfuge and [[subversion]] to hide the fact that they are an organization in their own right.\n\n==Definitions==\nHorton (2014) gives the \"example of entryism \u2013 the infiltration of a self-proclaimed human rights activist into an institution committed to neoliberalism, a market fundamentalism that has been credited with eroding health systems in dozens of low and middle-income countries.\"<ref>Horton, Richard (2014) Offline: the Kim Doctrine ''[[The Lancet]]'', Sep 6, 2014, Vol.384(9946), p.840</ref> Leslie (1999) uses the example of gender: \"alternative, yet complementary, strategies of 'entryism', with attempts to enter and transform these institutions' gender inequalities from within (as missionaries).\"<ref>Leslie, A.

''[[United Nations Chronicle]]'', 36(2), 82-83.</ref>\n\n==Socialist entryism==\n===Trotsky's \"French Turn\"===\nThe \"[[French Turn]]\" refers to the classic form of entrism advocated by [[Leon Trotsky]] in his essays on \"The French Turn\". In June 1934, he proposed for the French Trotskyists to dissolve their Communist League and to join the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) and for the Communist League to dissolve its youth section to join more easily with revolutionary elements. The tactic was adopted in August 1934, despite some opposition, and successfully raised the group's membership to 300 activists.\n\nProponents of the tactic advocated that the Trotskyists should enter the [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties to connect with revolutionary socialist currents within them and then to steer those currents toward [[Leninism]]. However, entryism lasted briefly since the leadership of the SFIO started to expel the Trotskyists. The Trotskyists of the [[Workers Party of the United States]] also successfully used their entry into the [[Socialist Party of America]] to recruit their youth group and other members. Similar tactics were also used by Trotskyist organisations in other countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Poland. Entryism was used to connect with and recruit leftward-moving political currents inside radical parties.\n\nSince it was used in France, Marxists have used the tactic even if they had different preconceptions of how long the period of entry would last:\n* A \"split perspective\" is sometimes employed in which the smaller party intends to remain in the larger party for a short period of time, with the intention of splitting the organisation and leaving with more members than it began with.\n* The entrist tactic can work successfully, in its own terms, over a long period. For example, it was attempted by the [[Militant tendency]] in the [[United Kingdom]], whose members worked within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from the 1950s onward and managed to get control in the [[Labour Party Young Socialists]] and [[Liverpool City Council]] before it was expelled in the 1980s. Many other Trotskyist groups have attempted similar feats, but few have gained the influence that the Militant tendancy attained (See Militant's [http://www.marxist.net/openturn/historic/index.html Problems of Entrism] pamphlet).\n\n===Deep entryism ''sui generis''{{anchor|Deep entrism|Deep entryism|Entrism sui generis|Entryism sui generis}}===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nIn these types of entryism, activists engage in a long-term perspective in which they work within an organisation for decades in the hope of gaining influence and a degree of power and perhaps even control of the larger organisation.\n\nIn entryism ''[[sui generis]]'' (\"of a special type\"), Trotskyists, for example, do not openly argue for the building of a Trotskyist party. \"Deep entryism\" refers to the long duration.\n\nThe tactic is closely identified with [[Michel Pablo]] and [[Gerry Healy]], who were leaders of the [[Fourth International]] in the late 1940s and the 1950s. The \"deep entry\" tactic was developed as a way for Trotskyists to respond to the [[Cold War]]. In countries with mass social democratic or communist parties, it was as difficult to be accepted into these parties as it was Trotskyist currents as to build separate Trotskyist parties. Therefore, Trotskyists were advised to join the mass party.\n\nIn Europe, that was the approach used, for example, by [[The Club (Trotskyist)|The Club]] and later [[Socialist Action (UK)|Socialist Action]] in the Labour Party,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11893986/Jeremy-Corbyns-top-team-encouraged-street-riots.html |title=Jeremy Corbyn's top team encouraged street riots |last=Gilligan |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Gilligan |date=26 September 2015 |website=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |access-date=2 April 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404121300/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11893986/Jeremy-Corbyns-top-team-encouraged-street-riots.html |archivedate=4 April 2018}}</ref> and by Fourth Internationalists inside the Communist Parties. In [[France]], Trotskyist organizations, most notably the ''[[Workers' Party (France)|Parti des Travailleurs]]'' and its predecessors, have successfully entered [[trade union]]s and mainstream [[left-wing]] parties.\n\n===Open entryism===\n{{See also|Platform (European politics)}}\nSome political parties, such as the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party in Brazil]] or the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], allow political tendencies to organise within them openly. In those cases, the term \"entryism\" is not usually used. Political groups that work within a larger organisation but also maintain a \"public face\" often reject the term \"entrism\" but are sometimes still considered to be entryists by the larger organization.\n\n==Examples by country==\n\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australia]], the practice was widespread during the 1950s, when the [[Communist Party of Australia]] battled against right-wing [[Industrial Groups]] for control of Australian [[trade unions]].

While opponents pointed to the remarkable distance, Orchard and his supporters argued that they represented \"traditional\" Conservative values and the [[economic nationalism]] of the older [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] and the Progressive Conservative Party had espoused before Mulroney, namely under [[John Diefenbaker]].\n\nOpponents of the 2003 merger between the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance also charged Alliance members with infiltration. It was widely speculated that most, if not all, of the approximately 25,000 Canadians who swelled the Progressive Conservative Party Party's membership before the merger vote were Alliance members, who likely voted in favour of the merger.\n\n[[Liberals for Life]], a [[pro-life]] group allied with the [[Campaign Life Coalition]], was accused of infiltrating the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in the late 1980s and the early 1990s.\n\nMembers of [[Socialist Action (Canada)|Socialist Action]], a small Trotskyist group, play a leading role in the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] [[New Democratic Party Socialist Caucus|Socialist Caucus]], a small faction on the left wing of the [[social democracy|social democratic]] NDP, and advocate that their members join and engage with the NDP. That, however, does not fit with most definitions of entryism because of its continued existence apart and separate from the NDP, in addition to its work in it. [[Fightback (Canada)|Fightback]], a rival Trotskyist organization, carries out a more classical form of entryism in the NDP, particularly in its youth wings, and models itself after the British [[Militant tendency]], which practiced entryism into the Labour Party and, at its peak, was the one of the most successful entryist organizations on record.\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Social Credit Party of British Columbia]], the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] saw the shift by the joining of former Social Credit members.  As a result, the new membership saw the party shift much more towards the right in fiscal policy. Thus, entryism led to a complete takeover of the original party by former Social Credit members. That, however, is not formal entryism since former Social Credit members did not operate their own organization within the Liberal Party.\n\n===China===\nDuring the [[Warlord Era]] in China, the [[Communist Party of China]] joined the party of the [[Nationalist Party of China]] for a time (1923\u20131927), creating the [[First United Front]] against warlordism, but one of the Communists' ideas behind doing so was the possibility of eventually gaining a majority in the Nationalist Party and shaping its policies. Eventually, the situation degraded, the Nationalists expelled the Communists from their party, and the [[Chinese Civil War]] began. The war was paused for a time (1936\u20131945) to allow for a [[Second United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Chinese resistance to Japanese imperial rule]].

The forest encompasses {{convert|1784457|acre|km2|0}}, including most of the scenic [[Ouachita Mountains]].  Six locations in the forest, comprising {{convert|65000|acre|km2|0}}, have been designated as [[wilderness]] areas.\n\n''Ouachita'' is the French spelling of the Indian word Washita, which means \"good hunting grounds.\" The forest was known as Arkansas National Forest on its establishment on December&nbsp;18, 1907; the name was changed to Ouachita National Forest on April&nbsp;29, 1926.<ref>{{Cite document|url=http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/Places/National%20Forests%20of%20the%20U.S.pdf|title=National Forests of the United States|date=September 29, 2005|author=Davis, Richard C.|publisher=The Forest History Society|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n[[image:AR Ouachita National Forest.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Ouachita National Forest]]\nRich in history, the rugged and scenic Ouachita Mountains were explored by Europeans in 1541 by [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de&nbsp;Soto's]] party of [[Spanish people|Spaniards]].

He compared flora and fauna in the Ouachita forest to those of the southern [[Allegheny Mountains|Alleghenies]], a division of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].<ref>Cobb, p. 282</ref> Cobb continues:\n\n<blockquote>A visitor standing upon one of the many majestic peaks in the area of the proposed park is thrilled by a panoramic view that cannot be had elsewhere in the South Central States. With cheeks flushed by the invigorating mountain breezes, the mountain climber is rewarded by an inspiring view of countless and nameless peaks, mountain groups, dense forests, and inviting valleys, all merging into the distant horizon. ... there are many mountain streams, now moving slowly in narrow but deep pools, then churning with savage ferocity down some water-worn precipice, leaving in its wake snow-white sprays ... Fed by crystal springs and like so much molten silver these streams flow their turbulent courses unappreciated and rarely visited. ...<ref>Cobb, p. 285</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Features==\nThe Forest contains extensive woodlands of stunted [[Northern Red Oak]], [[Quercus alba|White Oak]], [[Quercus stellata|post oak]], and [[Blackjack Oak]] at elevations over {{convert|2500|ft|m}} and on steep, dry slopes.<ref name=\"OldGrowthEastAR\">{{Cite web\n |url         = http://www.primalnature.org/ogeast/ar.pdf\n |title       = Old Growth in the East: A Survey.

The forest encompasses {{convert|1784457|acre|km2|0}}, including most of the scenic [[Ouachita Mountains]].  Six locations in the forest, comprising {{convert|65000|acre|km2|0}}, have been designated as [[wilderness]] areas.\n\n''Ouachita'' is the French spelling of the Indian word Washita, which means \"good hunting grounds.\" The forest was known as Arkansas National Forest on its establishment on December&nbsp;18, 1907; the name was changed to Ouachita National Forest on April&nbsp;29, 1926.<ref>{{Cite document|url=http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/Places/National%20Forests%20of%20the%20U.S.pdf|title=National Forests of the United States|date=September 29, 2005|author=Davis, Richard C.|publisher=The Forest History Society|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n[[image:AR Ouachita National Forest.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Ouachita National Forest]]\nRich in history, the rugged and scenic Ouachita Mountains were explored by Europeans in 1541 by [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de&nbsp;Soto's]] party of [[Spanish people|Spaniards]].

He compared flora and fauna in the Ouachita forest to those of the southern [[Allegheny Mountains|Alleghenies]], a division of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].<ref>Cobb, p. 282</ref> Cobb continues:\n\n<blockquote>A visitor standing upon one of the many majestic peaks in the area of the proposed park is thrilled by a panoramic view that cannot be had elsewhere in the South Central States. With cheeks flushed by the invigorating mountain breezes, the mountain climber is rewarded by an inspiring view of countless and nameless peaks, mountain groups, dense forests, and inviting valleys, all merging into the distant horizon. ... there are many mountain streams, now moving slowly in narrow but deep pools, then churning with savage ferocity down some water-worn precipice, leaving in its wake snow-white sprays ... Fed by crystal springs and like so much molten silver these streams flow their turbulent courses unappreciated and rarely visited. ...<ref>Cobb, p. 285</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Features==\nThe Forest contains extensive woodlands of stunted [[Northern Red Oak]], [[Quercus alba|White Oak]], [[Quercus stellata|post oak]], and [[Blackjack Oak]] at elevations over {{convert|2500|ft|m}} and on steep, dry slopes.<ref name=\"OldGrowthEastAR\">{{Cite web\n |url         = http://www.primalnature.org/ogeast/ar.pdf\n |title       = Old Growth in the East: A Survey.

It was established as a separate university on 29 July 1990, the 400th anniversary of the start of the reign of Phitsanulok-born King [[Naresuan]] the Great. A courtyard with a statue of King Naresuan is on the campus grounds and students regularly pay their respects before it. The university has about 20,000 full-time students.\n\n==History==\nOn 18 January 1964, the Ministry of Education resolved to create branches of the Bangkok's College of Education in each region of the country. On 25 January 1967, the Phitsanulok campus was established as the fourth branch of the College of Education and was meant to serve mainly the northern provinces.\n\nIn 1974 the College of Education was upgraded to university status and was named [[Srinakharinwirot University]]. Originally, only the third and fourth years of university study were offered at Phitsanulok, and students were admitted by competitive examination after completing the curriculum at one of the nation's associate degree level teacher training colleges. In 1976, the first and second years were added. Other majors besides education were gradually included, and in 1990 the Phitsanulok campus became independent of Srinakarinwirot University. It was designated \"Naresuan University\" during the celebrations of the 400th anniversary of King Naresuan the Great's ascension to the throne.\n\n[[Image:KingNU.jpg|200px|thumb|right| King Naresuan the Great statue, Naresuan University]]\n\nNaresuan University has a second campus in [[Phayao]], which opened in 1999 and was upgraded to university level and named \"[[University of Phayao]]\" in 2010. It also offers extension courses across the country at nine education centers, including [[Bangkok]].\n\n==Ranking==\nIn September 2006, Naresuan University was ranked as \"Very Good\" in a study conducted on Thai universities by the Commission on Higher Education and 5th in the uniRank 2017 Thai University Ranking.\n\n==Faculties==\nThe university has 16 [[Faculty (division)|faculties]],

It was established as a separate university on 29 July 1990, the 400th anniversary of the start of the reign of Phitsanulok-born King [[Naresuan]] the Great. A courtyard with a statue of King Naresuan is on the campus grounds and students regularly pay their respects before it. The university has about 20,000 full-time students.\n\n==History==\nOn 18 January 1964, the Ministry of Education resolved to create branches of the Bangkok's College of Education in each region of the country. On 25 January 1967, the Phitsanulok campus was established as the fourth branch of the College of Education and was meant to serve mainly the northern provinces.\n\nIn 1974 the College of Education was upgraded to university status and was named [[Srinakharinwirot University]]. Originally, only the third and fourth years of university study were offered at Phitsanulok, and students were admitted by competitive examination after completing the curriculum at one of the nation's associate degree level teacher training colleges. In 1976, the first and second years were added. Other majors besides education were gradually included, and in 1990 the Phitsanulok campus became independent of Srinakarinwirot University. It was designated \"Naresuan University\" during the celebrations of the 400th anniversary of King Naresuan the Great's ascension to the throne.\n\n[[Image:KingNU.jpg|200px|thumb|right| King Naresuan the Great statue, Naresuan University]]\n\nNaresuan University has a second campus in [[Phayao]], which opened in 1999 and was upgraded to university level and named \"[[University of Phayao]]\" in 2010. It also offers extension courses across the country at nine education centers, including [[Bangkok]].\n\n==Ranking==\nIn September 2006, Naresuan University was ranked as \"Very Good\" in a study conducted on Thai universities by the Commission on Higher Education and 5th in the uniRank 2017 Thai University Ranking.\n\n==Faculties==\nThe university has 16 [[Faculty (division)|faculties]], organized into three clusters:<ref>{{cite web |title=Faculties/Colleges/Schools |url=http://old.nu.ac.th/en/b1_faculties_colleges_schools.php |website=Naresuan University |accessdate=11 April

Serving initially in the Middle East, he later gained renown for his actions during the [[Battle of Isurava]], one of many battles forming the [[Kokoda Track campaign|Kokoda Track Campaign]] in the south-east of the island of [[New Guinea]], then part of the Australian [[Territory of Papua]] (now Papua New Guinea) . His bravery during the battle was recognised with the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry \"in the face of the enemy\" that can be awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. The first serviceman to [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|receive]] the VC for actions on Australian territory, Kingsbury was a member of the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Infantry Battalion]].\n\nOn 29 August 1942, during the Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury was one of the few survivors of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his [[Bren light machine gun|Bren gun]] from the hip, he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then shot by a sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Preston, Victoria|Preston]] on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury was the second son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie, n\u00e9e Steel.<ref name=adb /> Growing up in [[Prahran]], Kingsbury became friends with Allen Avery when he was five years old. The two often raced billy carts down the hilly streets, and would remain lifelong friends.<ref name=Dornan1>{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=11\u201318}}</ref> Kingsbury attended [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]] State School as a child, and his results were good enough to earn a scholarship at [[RMIT University|Melbourne Technical College]]. Avery began an agricultural course in Longerenong. Although qualified as a printer, Kingsbury began working at his father's real estate business,<ref name=adb>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=McAllester|first=James|id=A150032b|title=Kingsbury, Bruce Steel (1918\u20131942) |publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|year=2000|accessdate=7 March 2009}}</ref> a job he disliked.<ref name=Dornan1 />\n\nUnhappy in the estate agency, Kingsbury took up the position of caretaker on a farm at [[Boundary Bend, Victoria|Boundary Bend]], not far from where Avery was working. After three months, the pair decided that they would go on an adventure \u2013 walking through western Victoria and [[New South Wales]].<ref name = Dornan1 /> In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left their jobs and began travelling north, working on various farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, while Avery worked as a nurseryman.<ref name=Dornan1 /> They spent their free time at dances and parties. During this time, Kingsbury met and became close to Leila Bradbury.<ref name = Dornan1 /> As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery made up their minds to enlist.

The pair went to Melbourne to try to organise the wedding. Although Kingsbury gave Leila a wristwatch as an engagement present, they could not arrange a marriage licence before he left, and the marriage never took place.<ref name=Dornan2/>\n\nKingsbury, along with the rest of the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], was shipped to the Middle East in late 1940.

Serving initially in the Middle East, he later gained renown for his actions during the [[Battle of Isurava]], one of many battles forming the [[Kokoda Track campaign|Kokoda Track Campaign]] in the south-east of the island of [[New Guinea]], then part of the Australian [[Territory of Papua]] (now Papua New Guinea) . His bravery during the battle was recognised with the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry \"in the face of the enemy\" that can be awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. The first serviceman to [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|receive]] the VC for actions on Australian territory, Kingsbury was a member of the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Infantry Battalion]].\n\nOn 29 August 1942, during the Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury was one of the few survivors of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his [[Bren light machine gun|Bren gun]] from the hip, he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then shot by a sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Preston, Victoria|Preston]] on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury was the second son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie, n\u00e9e Steel.<ref name=adb /> Growing up in [[Prahran]], Kingsbury became friends with Allen Avery when he was five years old. The two often raced billy carts down the hilly streets, and would remain lifelong friends.<ref name=Dornan1>{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=11\u201318}}</ref> Kingsbury attended [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]] State School as a child, and his results were good enough to earn a scholarship at [[RMIT University|Melbourne Technical College]]. Avery began an agricultural course in Longerenong. Although qualified as a printer, Kingsbury began working at his father's real estate business,<ref name=adb>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=McAllester|first=James|id=A150032b|title=Kingsbury, Bruce Steel (1918\u20131942) |publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|year=2000|accessdate=7 March 2009}}</ref> a job he disliked.<ref name=Dornan1 />\n\nUnhappy in the estate agency, Kingsbury took up the position of caretaker on a farm at [[Boundary Bend, Victoria|Boundary Bend]], not far from where Avery was working. After three months, the pair decided that they would go on an adventure \u2013 walking through western Victoria and [[New South Wales]].<ref name = Dornan1 /> In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left their jobs and began travelling north, working on various farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, while Avery worked as a nurseryman.<ref name=Dornan1 /> They spent their free time at dances and parties. During this time, Kingsbury met and became close to Leila Bradbury.<ref name = Dornan1 /> As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery made up their minds to enlist. Despite his parents' disapproval, Kingsbury signed up to the [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] on 29 May 1940.<ref name=WW2Roll>{{citation|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=A&veteranId=431320|title=Kingsbury, Bruce Steel|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|date=|accessdate=7 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n===Middle East===\nKingsbury was originally assigned to the [[2/2nd Pioneer Battalion (Australia)|2/2nd Pioneer Battalion]], but requested a transfer to the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Infantry Battalion]] to join Avery who had, coincidentally, enlisted on the same day at a different recruitment centre.<ref name=adb /><ref name=Dornan2>{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=19\u201326}}</ref> The pair undertook basic training at [[Puckapunyal]], where they were assigned to the same [[Section (military unit)|section]] (7 Section of 9 Platoon) and were given drill instruction, rifle drill and mock battle training.<ref name=Dornan2/> After 7 Section learned they would be sent overseas, Kingsbury informed Avery that he planned to propose to Leila. The pair went to Melbourne to try to organise the wedding. Although Kingsbury gave Leila a wristwatch as an engagement present, they could not arrange a marriage licence before he left, and the marriage never took place.<ref name=Dornan2/>\n\nKingsbury, along with the rest of the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], was shipped to the Middle East in late 1940.

After this, the battalion underwent training in [[Glen Innes, New South Wales|Glen Innes]], before camping in [[Yandina, Queensland|Yandina]], Queensland.

The Australians, who had initially been outnumbered but were now roughly equal in strength, resisted in the face of heavy machine-gun fire and hand-to-hand combat.

{"title_page": "X video extension", "text_new": "{{for|the website of a similar same name|XVideos}}\n\n{{primary sources|date=March 2013}}\nThe '''X video extension''', often abbreviated as '''XVideo''' or '''Xv''', is a video output mechanism for the [[X Window System]]. The protocol was designed by David Carver; the specification for version 2 of the protocol was written in July 1991.<ref>[http://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/videoproto/xv-protocol-v2.txt Official XVideo specification, version 2.0]</ref> It is mainly used today to resize video content in the video controller hardware in order to enlarge a given video or to watch it in full screen mode. Without XVideo, X would have to do this scaling on the main CPU.  That requires a considerable amount of processing power, which could slow down or degrade the video stream; video controllers are specifically designed for this kind of computation, so can do it much more cheaply. Similarly, the X video extension can have the video controller perform [[color space]] conversions, and change the contrast, brightness, and hue of a displayed video stream.\n\nIn order for this to work, three things have to come together:\n\n* The video controller has to provide the required functions.\n* The [[device driver]] software for the video controller and the X [[display server]] program have to implement the XVideo interface.\n* The video playback software has to make use of this interface.\n\nMost modern video controllers provide the functions required for XVideo; this feature is known as ''hardware scaling and [[YUV]] acceleration'' or sometimes as ''2D hardware acceleration''. The [[XFree86]] X display server has implemented XVideo since version 4.0.2. To check whether a given X display server supports XVideo, one can use the utility <tt>xdpyinfo</tt>. To check whether the video controller provides the required functions and whether the X device driver implements XVideo for any of them, one can use the <tt>xvinfo</tt> program.\n\nVideo playback programs that run under the X Window system, such as [[MPlayer]], [[MythTV]] or [[xine]], typically have an option to enable XVideo output. It is very advisable to switch on this option if the system [[graphics processing unit|GPU]] video-hardware and device drivers supports XVideo and more modern rendering systems such as OpenGL and VDPAU are unavailable \u2013 the speedup is very noticeable even on a fast [[Central processing unit|CPU]].\n\nWhile the protocol itself has features for reading and writing of video streams from and to video adapters, in practice today only the functions <tt>XvPutImage</tt> and <tt>XvShmPutImage</tt> are used: the client program repeatedly prepares images and passes them on to the graphics hardware to be scaled, converted and displayed.\n\n== Display ==\n\nAfter video has been scaled and prepared for display on the video card, it must be displayed. There are a few possible ways to display accelerated video at this stage. Since full acceleration means that the video controller is responsible for scaling, converting, and drawing the video, the technique used depends entirely on what the video is being drawn onto.\n\n=== The role of window manager support and compositing ===\n\nUnder X, how video is finally drawn depends largely on the [[X window manager]] in use. With properly installed drivers, and [[graphics processing unit|GPU]] hardware such as supported [[Intel]], [[ATI (brand)|ATI]], and [[nVidia]] chip sets, some [[window managers]], called [[compositing window manager]]s, allow windows to be separately processed and then rendered (or composited). This involves all windows being rendered to separate output buffers in memory first, and later combined to form a complete graphical interface. While in (video) memory, individual windows can be transformed separately, and accelerated video may be added at this stage using a texture filter, before the window is composited and drawn. XVideo can also be used to accelerate video playback during the drawing of windows using an OpenGL [[Framebuffer Object]] or pbuffer.\n\n[[Metacity]], an [[X window manager]] uses compositing in this way. The compositing can also make use of 3D pipelines accelerations such as GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap. Among other things, this process allows many video outputs to share the same screen without interfering with each other. Other [[compositing window manager]]s such as [[Compiz]] also use compositing.\n\nHowever, on a system with limited OpenGL acceleration function, specifically the lack of an OpenGL [[Framebuffer Object]] or [[pbuffer]], the use of an OpenGL environment like [[Xgl]] makes xv hardware accelerations impossible.\n\n=== The disadvantages of chroma keying ===\n\nIn the event that the window manager doesn't directly support compositing, it is more difficult to isolate where the video stream should be rendered, because by the time it can be accelerated the output has already been turned into a single image. The only way to do this is usually to employ a post processed [[hardware overlay]], using [[chroma keying]]. After all of the windows have already been drawn, the only pieces of information we have available are the size and position of the video window's canvas. A third piece of information is required to indicate which parts of the video window's canvas are obscured by other windows and which are not. Therefore, the video player draws its canvas using a solid color (we'll say green), and this color becomes a makeshift third dimension. When all windows have been drawn, windows covering the video player will block out the green color. When the video stream is added to the output, the graphics card can simply scan the co-ordinates of the canvas. When it encounters green, it knows it has found a visible portion of the video window, and only draws those portions of the video. This same process was also the only available option to render hardware accelerated video under [[Microsoft]] [[Windows XP]] and earlier, since its window management features were so deeply embedded into the operating system that accelerating them would have been impossible.\n\nIf the window manager doesn't support compositing, post processed [[hardware overlay]]s using [[chroma keying]] as described in the previous paragraph can make it impossible to produce a proper [[screenshot]]s of Xvideo applications. It can also make it impossible to view this kind of playback on a secondary display when only one overlay is allowed at the hardware level.\n\n{{further information|Stacking window manager}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[X-Video Motion Compensation]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/videoproto/xv-protocol-v2.txt  Official X Video Extension specification, version 2.0]\n* [http://www.x.org/docs/Xv/video Additions in XVideo version 2.2]\n* [http://www.xfree86.org/4.2.1/Xv.3.html Xv man pages]\n\n=== Example programs ===\n* [http://bellet.info/XVideo/testxv.c testxv.c]: on most installations, it is compiled by \"<code>gcc -o testxv testxv.c -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -lXext -lXv</code>\"\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071109112508/http://www.wedesoft.demon.co.uk/downloads/testxv2.cc testxv2.cc]: another example in C++\n\n{{XWinSys}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:X Video Extension}}\n[[Category:Application layer protocols]]\n[[Category:Application programming interfaces]]\n[[Category:Freedesktop.org]]\n[[Category:X Window extensions]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the website of a similar same name|XVideos}}\n\n{{primary sources|date=March 2013}}\n{{Infobox software\n|name                       = X video extension\n|logo                       = \n|screenshot                 = \n|caption                    = \n\n|collapsible                = \n|author                     = [[X.Org Foundation]]\n|developer                  = \n|released                   = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD}} -->\n|latest release version     = 2.0\n|latest release date        = {{Start date and age|1991|7|25}}\n|latest preview version     = \n|latest preview date        = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} -->\n|frequently updated         = \n|programming language       = \n|operating system           = \n|platform                   = \n|size                       = \n|language                   = \n|status                     = \n|genre                      = \n|license                    = \n|website                    = \n}}\nThe '''X video extension''', often abbreviated as '''XVideo''' or '''Xv''', is a video output mechanism for the [[X Window System]].

The process repeats until he strikes the side of a gate, then he and the turnpike keeper switch places.\n\nConflict games such as \"hoop battle\" or \"tournament\" can also be played.

The aim of the game is to keep the hoop upright for long periods of time, or to do various [[juggling trick|tricks]].\n\nHoop rolling has been documented since antiquity in Africa, Asia and Europe. Played as a [[target practice|target game]], it is an ancient tradition widely dispersed among different societies. In Asia, the earliest records date from Ancient China, and in Europe from Ancient Greece.\n\nIn the West, the most common materials for the equipment have been wood and metal. Wooden hoops, driven with a stick about one foot long, are struck with the centre or the 2/3 point of the stick in order to ensure good progress. Metal hoops, instead of being struck, are often guided by a metal hook.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Boy's Treasury of Sports, Pastimes, and Recreations: With Nearly Four Hundred Engravings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvQ-AAAAYAAJ|year=1848|publisher=J.P.

In order that the passers-by may get out of the way of the hoop.\"(14. CLXIX) He also indicates that the metal tires of wooden cart wheels could be used as hoops: \"A wheel must be protected.

After running all the gates, the openings are made smaller by one inch, and the player trundling the hoop runs the course again. The process repeats until he strikes the side of a gate, then he and the turnpike keeper switch places.\n\nConflict games such as \"hoop battle\" or \"tournament\" can also be played. For this game, boys organise into opposing teams that drive their hoops against each other with the aim of knocking down as many of the opponents' hoops as possible.
