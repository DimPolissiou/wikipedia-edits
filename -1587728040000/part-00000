Founded in Vernon in 1961, the BCHL now includes 17 teams. These teams play in three divisions, known as the Interior, Island and Mainland divisions.  The winner of the BCHL playoffs (Fred Page Cup) continues on to play the [[Alberta Junior Hockey League]] champion in the [[Doyle Cup]] for the right to compete in the [[National Junior A Championship]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1961, the heads of four junior \"B\" hockey teams in the [[Okanagan]] region of [[British Columbia]] got together and formed the first Junior \"A\" league in British Columbia's history. The '''Okanagan-Mainline Junior \"A\" Hockey League''' (OMJHL) originally consisted of the [[Kamloops Rockets|Kamloops Jr. Rockets]], the [[Kelowna Buckaroos]], the [[Penticton Vees|Penticton Jr. Vees]], and the [[Vernon Vipers|Vernon Jr. Canadians]].\n\nIn 1967, the league expanded out of the Okanagan region, bringing in the [[New Westminster Royals]] and the [[Victoria Cougars]].  With the expansion, the league decided that since it was no longer solely in the Okanagan region that it need a new name, becoming the '''British Columbia Junior Hockey League''' (BCJHL).  A year later, the [[Vancouver Centennials]] joined the league.  In the 1970s, the Victoria Cougars jumped to the [[Western Hockey League]] and the New Westminster team was forced to fold due to the relocation of the [[Estevan Bruins]] into their arena.  In 1972, the [[Bellingham Blazers]] and the [[Nanaimo Clippers]] expanded the league to eight teams.\n\nMeanwhile, in the early 1970s, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association separated the two tiers of Junior \"A\" hockey.  The BCJHL, being a Tier II league, was then disallowed from competing for the [[Memorial Cup]], which had traditionally been the National Junior A Championship trophy. Consequentially, the Tier II Junior \"A\" leagues across Canada agreed to compete for a new trophy called the [[Royal Bank Cup|Centennial Cup]].  The 1970s also saw the rise of a rival league for the BCJHL, the [[Pacific Coast Junior Hockey League]] (PCJHL), which briefly existed in the 1960s, was resurrected by [[Fred Page]] for the 1971\u201372 season. Page had roots in managing junior hockey leagues, and today there are two championship trophies named for him &ndash; the Eastern Champion Junior \"A\" [[Fred Page Cup]] and the BCHL Championship trophy. The PCJHL was elevated to a Junior \"A\" league for the 1973\u201374 season, adjusting its name to the [[Pacific Junior A Hockey League]] (PJHL). The PJHL champion then competed with the BCJHL champion in a provincial championship, the [[Mowat Cup]], with the winner moving on to what was the precursor to the [[Doyle Cup]]. The PJHL's Nor'Wes Caps won the 1976 Mowat Cup, while the PJHL's [[Richmond Sockeyes]] won the 1977 and 1979 Mowat Cups. Fred Page agreed to allow a merger between the PJHL and the BCJHL for the 1979\u201380 season.\n\nThe existence of the two Junior \"A\" leagues in British Columbia caused an unusual turn of events in the 1977\u201378 season postseason. The BCJHL sent their regular season champion, the [[Merritt Centennials]], to play as the BC representative in the Pacific region (BC and Alberta) interprovincial [[Doyle Cup]], excusing them from the BCJHL playoffs.  The BCJHL continued their league playoffs without them, crowning Nanaimo as the playoff champion after Penticton refused to finish the playoff finals due to a series of brawls in the third game of the series.  Meanwhile, the Merritt Centennials won the Doyle Cup and advanced to the [[Abbott Cup]] (the Western Canada Championship) against the winner of the [[ANAVET Cup]], the Western region champion [[Prince Albert Raiders]] of the [[Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League]]. The Centennials lost to the Raiders, four games to one.\n\nDuring the 1980-81 season, the Coastal division season was interrupted by a Ferry strike in late January.  Since the mainland teams could no longer reach the island teams, the Coastal Division stopped playing, and began extended playoff rounds in place of the regular season.\n\nIn 1986, Penticton became the BCJHL's first Junior \"A\" national champion, defeating the [[Maritime Junior A Hockey League|Metro Valley Junior Hockey League]]'s [[Cole Harbour Colts]] by a score of 7\u20134 to win the [[Royal Bank Cup|Centennial Cup]]. A year later, the BCJHL's Richmond Sockeyes won the league's second consecutive national title.\n\nIn 1990, the BCJHL was renamed to '''British Columbia Hockey League''' (BCHL) and changed its logo twice in 1990 and 2000.\n\nThe most notable star to come from the BCHL is [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] and [[National Hockey League]] hall of famer [[Brett Hull]] who played for Penticton.  Hull holds the BCHL record for most goals in a season (105), which he set in 1983\u201384, a record that still stands today. Other NHLers who once played in the BCHL include [[Chuck Kobasew]] of the Penticton Panthers, [[Scott Gomez]] of the South Surrey Eagles, [[Carey Price]] of the [[Quesnel Millionaires]], and [[Willie Mitchell (ice hockey)|Willie Mitchell]] of the [[Kelowna Spartans]].\n\nAs of July 2013, the TheHockeyWriters.com lists the BCHL as the sixth best developmental league, professional or amateur, in [[North America]].<ref>http://thehockeywriters.com/top-10-best-developmental-ice-hockey-leagues-north-america/</ref>\n\nThe [[Wenatchee Wild]], previously of the [[North American Hockey League]] had been attempting to get into the BCHL since 2012. On June 1, 2015, it was announced that they would be joining for the 2015\u201316 season, marking the league's return to the US after a twenty-year absence.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Wenatchee Wild Join

[[ice hockey]] league from [[British Columbia]] under [[Hockey Canada]], a subsection of the [[Canadian Junior Hockey League]].  Founded in Vernon in 1961, the BCHL now includes 17 teams. These teams play in three divisions, known as the Interior, Island and Mainland divisions.  The winner of the BCHL playoffs (Fred Page Cup) continues on to play the [[Alberta Junior Hockey League]] champion in the [[Doyle Cup]] for the right to compete in the [[National Junior A Championship]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1961, the heads of four junior \"B\" hockey teams in the [[Okanagan]] region of [[British Columbia]] got together and formed the first Junior \"A\" league in British Columbia's history. The '''Okanagan-Mainline Junior \"A\" Hockey League''' (OMJHL) originally consisted of the [[Kamloops Rockets|Kamloops Jr. Rockets]], the [[Kelowna Buckaroos]], the [[Penticton Vees|Penticton Jr. Vees]], and the [[Vernon Vipers|Vernon Jr. Canadians]].\n\nIn 1967, the league expanded out of the Okanagan region, bringing in the [[New Westminster Royals]] and the [[Victoria Cougars]].  With the expansion, the league decided that since it was no longer solely in the Okanagan region that it need a new name, becoming the '''British Columbia Junior Hockey League''' (BCJHL).  A year later, the [[Vancouver Centennials]] joined the league.  In the 1970s, the Victoria Cougars jumped to the [[Western Hockey League]] and the New Westminster team was forced to fold due to the relocation of the [[Estevan Bruins]] into their arena.  In 1972, the [[Bellingham Blazers]] and the [[Nanaimo Clippers]] expanded the league to eight teams.\n\nMeanwhile, in the early 1970s, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association separated the two tiers of Junior \"A\" hockey.  The BCJHL, being a Tier II league, was then disallowed from competing for the [[Memorial Cup]], which had traditionally been the National Junior A Championship trophy. Consequentially, the Tier II Junior \"A\" leagues across Canada agreed to compete for a new trophy called the [[Royal Bank Cup|Centennial Cup]].  The 1970s also saw the rise of a rival league for the BCJHL, the [[Pacific Coast Junior Hockey League]] (PCJHL), which briefly existed in the 1960s, was resurrected by [[Fred Page]] for the 1971\u201372 season. Page had roots in managing junior hockey leagues, and today there are two championship trophies named for him &ndash; the Eastern Champion Junior \"A\" [[Fred Page Cup]] and the BCHL Championship trophy. The PCJHL was elevated to a Junior \"A\" league for the 1973\u201374 season, adjusting its name to the [[Pacific Junior A Hockey League]] (PJHL). The PJHL champion then competed with the BCJHL champion in a provincial championship, the [[Mowat Cup]], with the winner moving on to what was the precursor to the [[Doyle Cup]]. The PJHL's Nor'Wes Caps won the 1976 Mowat Cup, while the PJHL's [[Richmond Sockeyes]] won the 1977 and 1979 Mowat Cups. Fred Page agreed to allow a merger between the PJHL and the BCJHL for the 1979\u201380 season.\n\nThe existence of the two Junior \"A\" leagues in British Columbia caused an unusual turn of events in the 1977\u201378 season postseason. The BCJHL sent their regular season champion, the [[Merritt Centennials]], to play as the BC representative in the Pacific region (BC and Alberta) interprovincial [[Doyle Cup]], excusing them from the BCJHL playoffs.  The BCJHL continued their league playoffs without them, crowning Nanaimo as the playoff champion after Penticton refused to finish the playoff finals due to a series of brawls in the third game of the series.  Meanwhile, the Merritt Centennials won the Doyle Cup and advanced to the [[Abbott Cup]] (the Western Canada Championship) against the winner of the [[ANAVET Cup]], the Western region champion [[Prince Albert Raiders]] of the [[Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League]]. The Centennials lost to the Raiders, four games to one.\n\nDuring the 1980-81 season, the Coastal division season was interrupted by a Ferry strike in late January.  Since the mainland teams could no longer reach the island teams, the Coastal Division stopped playing, and began extended playoff rounds in place of the regular season.\n\nIn 1986, Penticton became the BCJHL's first Junior \"A\" national champion, defeating the [[Maritime Junior A Hockey League|Metro Valley Junior Hockey League]]'s [[Cole Harbour Colts]] by a score of 7\u20134 to win the [[Royal Bank Cup|Centennial Cup]]. A year later, the BCJHL's Richmond Sockeyes won the league's second consecutive national title.\n\nIn 1990, the BCJHL was renamed to '''British Columbia Hockey League''' (BCHL) and changed its logo twice in 1990 and 2000.\n\nThe most notable star to come from the BCHL is [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] and [[National Hockey League]] hall of famer [[Brett Hull]] who played for Penticton.  Hull holds the BCHL record for most goals in a season (105), which he set in 1983\u201384, a record that still stands today. Other NHLers who once played in the BCHL include [[Chuck Kobasew]] of the Penticton Panthers, [[Scott Gomez]] of the South Surrey Eagles, [[Carey Price]] of the [[Quesnel Millionaires]], and [[Willie Mitchell (ice hockey)|Willie Mitchell]] of the [[Kelowna Spartans]].\n\nAs of July 2013, the TheHockeyWriters.com lists the BCHL as the sixth best developmental league, professional or amateur, in [[North America]].<ref>http://thehockeywriters.com/top-10-best-developmental-ice-hockey-leagues-north-america/</ref>\n\nThe [[Wenatchee Wild]], previously of the [[North American Hockey League]] had been attempting to get into the BCHL since 2012. On June 1, 2015, it was announced that they would be joining for the 2015\u201316 season, marking the league's return to the US after a twenty-year absence.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Wenatchee Wild Join

Lt. Gen. Nikolai Parshin, chief of the Missile and Artillery Directorate, said that after Dutch investigators displayed parts of the missile and their serial numbers, they studied and declassified archives at the research center that produced the Buk missiles. Parshin said the Russian archives show that the missile that was made of these parts was transported to a military unit in western Ukraine in 1986, and to Russia's knowledge never left Ukraine.

They played in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], [[New Hampshire]], at the [[Verizon Wireless Arena]]. They were the AHL affiliate of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) [[Los Angeles Kings]] during the team's entire existence. For the [[2015\u201316 AHL season|2015\u201316 season]], the Monarchs traded places with the Kings' affiliate in the [[ECHL]], the [[Ontario Reign (ECHL)|Ontario Reign]]; the AHL franchise moved to [[Ontario, California|Ontario]], [[California]], and play at [[Citizens Business Bank Arena]] where they became the new [[Ontario Reign (AHL)|Ontario Reign]], while the ECHL team moved to New Hampshire retaining the [[Manchester Monarchs (ECHL)|Manchester Monarchs]] name.\n\nThe Monarchs won their only [[Calder Cup]] in their final AHL season.\n\n==History==\nIn 1999,<ref name=\"bizapedia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bizapedia.com/de/MANCHESTER-HOCKEY-GROUP-LLC.html|title=Manchester Hockey Group, L.L.C. in Wilmington, DE - Bizapedia|publisher=bizapedia.com|accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref> [[Howard Baldwin]] founded Manchester Hockey Group LLC, while in the process of moving a dormant AHL franchise to New Hampshire to start play in 2001.

The Monarchs played their first game on October 6, 2001, against the [[Lowell Lock Monsters]], losing 6\u20133. Their first win was a week later, on October 13, against the [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]]. The team has been competitive within the division every year of its existence. They won their first Atlantic Division title in [[2004\u201305 AHL season|2004\u201305]], but lost in the first round to the [[Providence Bruins]]. This continued the streak of first round playoff exits, which the team had experienced in every year of existence, and would come to include the [[2005\u201306 AHL season|2005\u201306 season]].\n\nThe [[2006\u201307 AHL season|2006\u201307 campaign]] was the team's best season prior to [[2014\u201315 AHL season|2014\u201315]], the season in which the team won its only [[Calder Cup]] championship. With rookie head coach [[Mark Morris (ice hockey)|Mark Morris]], leading scorers [[Matt Moulson]] and [[Noah Clarke]], and former League MVP [[Jason LaBarbera]] in goal, the team had their best-ever finish, winning the Atlantic Division title with the second-best points total in the League.\n\nHeading into the playoffs, there were doubts within the team, as goaltender LaBarbera had ended the season injured. The team faced the [[Worcester Sharks]] in the first round. With LaBarbera coming back by Game 2, the Monarchs defeated the Sharks in six games, including double-overtime thrillers in Games 2 and 6. The second round brought the Providence Bruins, who put up as much, if not more, of a fight. The Monarchs found a way, however, and defeated the Bruins in six games. This brought the Monarchs to their first ever Eastern Conference Finals, but they were swept by the defending champions, the [[Hershey Bears]], in four games.\n\nFollowing their run in 2007, the Monarchs looked to have holes to fill, as Jason LaBarbera was called up to the Kings, along with several other players. The [[2007\u201308 AHL season|2007\u201308 season]] was an up-and-down one, which ended following a sweep by the Providence Bruins in the first round of the playoffs. The [[2008\u201309 AHL season|2008\u201309 season]] was a landmark year for the franchise, but not in the way they would hope. Despite a late surge, the team finished fifth, five points out of the playoffs, for the first time in franchise history.\n\nThe first half of the [[2009\u201310 AHL season|2009\u201310 season]] proved to be successful for the Monarchs squad. Several players were promoted to Los Angeles, including [[Richard Clune]] and [[Alec Martinez]].

The Monarchs played their first game on October 6, 2001, against the [[Lowell Lock Monsters]], losing 6\u20133. Their first win was a week later, on October 13, against the [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]]. The team has been competitive within the division every year of its existence. They won their first Atlantic Division title in [[2004\u201305 AHL season|2004\u201305]], but lost in the first round to the [[Providence Bruins]]. This continued the streak of first round playoff exits, which the team had experienced in every year of existence, and would come to include the [[2005\u201306 AHL season|2005\u201306 season]].\n\nThe [[2006\u201307 AHL season|2006\u201307 campaign]] was the team's best season prior to [[2014\u201315 AHL season|2014\u201315]], the season in which the team won its only [[Calder Cup]] championship. With rookie head coach [[Mark Morris (ice hockey)|Mark Morris]], leading scorers [[Matt Moulson]] and [[Noah Clarke]], and former League MVP [[Jason LaBarbera]] in goal, the team had their best-ever finish, winning the Atlantic Division title with the second-best points total in the League.\n\nHeading into the playoffs, there were doubts within the team, as goaltender LaBarbera had ended the season injured. The team faced the [[Worcester Sharks]] in the first round. With LaBarbera coming back by Game 2, the Monarchs defeated the Sharks in six games, including double-overtime thrillers in Games 2 and 6. The second round brought the Providence Bruins, who put up as much, if not more, of a fight. The Monarchs found a way, however, and defeated the Bruins in six games. This brought the Monarchs to their first ever Eastern Conference Finals, but they were swept by the defending champions, the [[Hershey Bears]], in four games.\n\nFollowing their run in 2007, the Monarchs looked to have holes to fill, as Jason LaBarbera was called up to the Kings, along with several other players. The [[2007\u201308 AHL season|2007\u201308 season]] was an up-and-down one, which ended following a sweep by the Providence Bruins in the first round of the playoffs. The [[2008\u201309 AHL season|2008\u201309 season]] was a landmark year for the franchise, but not in the way they would hope. Despite a late surge, the team finished fifth, five points out of the playoffs, for the first time in franchise history.\n\nThe first half of the [[2009\u201310 AHL season|2009\u201310 season]] proved to be successful for the Monarchs squad. Several players were promoted to Los Angeles, including [[Richard Clune]] and [[Alec Martinez]]. The Monarchs won their home opener of the [[2010\u201311 AHL season|2010\u201311 season]], as [[David Meckler]] scored the game-winning goal in front of 9,035 fans at the Verizon Wireless Arena on October 16, 2010. The game was also noteworthy as left wing [[Brandon Kozun]] and center [[Justin Azevedo]] were awarded penalty shots, the first time in franchise history that two players were awarded penalty shots in the same game.\n\nThe Manchester Monarchs have made it to the playoffs all but one season since coming into existence, winning their first Calder Cup following the 2014\u201315 season.\n\nFor the 2014\u201315 season, the Monarchs ditched the purple and gold colors of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] (and former Los Angeles Kings' colors) that had been with the team since its inception, and adopted the same black and silver color scheme that the Kings have used since 2011.\n\nOn January 29, 2015, it was confirmed by the AHL via press conference that the Monarchs would relocate from Manchester, New Hampshire, to Ontario, California.

In humans, coronaviruses cause [[respiratory tract infection]]s that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the [[common cold]] (which is caused also by certain other viruses, predominantly [[rhinovirus]]es), while more lethal varieties can cause [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome|MERS]], and [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]]. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an [[upper respiratory tract infection|upper respiratory tract disease]], while in cows and pigs they cause [[diarrhea]].
