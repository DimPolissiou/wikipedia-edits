Symptoms used to diagnose the disease are angular, water soaked lesions and necrotic blotches.  ''Aphelenchoides fragariae'' is the nematode pathogen that causes the disease.  Its biological cycle includes four life stages, three of which are juvenile.  The nematode can undergo multiple life cycles in one growing season when favorable conditions are present.  They can infect the crowns, runners, foliage,  and new buds of the plant via stylet penetration or through the stomata.  The best management practices for this disease are sanitation, prevention of induction of the pathogen to the environment, and planting clean seed or starter plants.\n\n==Importance==\n\nFoliar nematodes are an important plant pathogen to agricultural crops and ornamental plants in the United States, Canada, and Europe.<ref name=\"Jagdale 2002\">Jagdale, G.

They appear dwarfed, stunted, and brown in comparison to healthy plants. Local symptoms appear above ground, and plant leaves are typically distorted in shape, crinkled, and discolored with hard surfaces. They often have reduced flower size.

If the nematodes infect early in plant development, specifically when the buds are forming, the plant morphology will be dwarfed and distorted. \nOnce the nematodes destroy most of the leaf tissue, they leave the plant through wounds and natural openings in the leaf to find a new host to infect.

While dormant, they are quite difficult to kill, and they remain viable in dry debris for more than one year.  Adult nematodes can survive desiccation and lie dormant for several years.  Eggs can stay dormant until survival conditions are optimal for growth.  Once eggs or nematodes are present in the soil, they are nearly impossible to eradicate because they can move laterally in the soil to escape non-optimal conditions.   They are found in most foliar tissue, including the leaves, stems, buds, and crowns, making it difficult to control the disease on the plant itself once it has been infected \n.<ref name=\"Davis 2008\"/>\n\nMany plant diseases are managed chemically, but due to a ban of nematicides there are currently no nematicides available for any type of foliar nematode.  Some insecticides, pesticides, and plant product extracts from plants such as Ficus and Coffee (of which many pesticides and nematicides are neem-based <ref name=\"Akhtar and Mahmood, 1994\">Mohammad Akhtar, Irshad Mahmood, Potentiality of phytochemicals in nematode control: A review, Bioresource Technology, Volume 48, Issue 3, 1994, Pages 189\u2013201, ISSN 0960-8524, 10.1016/0960-8524(94)90146-5.</ref>) can be used to reduce the numbers of strawberry foliar nematode (a reduction of 67\u201385%), but none of these chemicals can completely eradicate the nematodes once they are present in the soil.  These chemicals affect all stages of the life cycle because they target the nervous system.   One chemical, ZeroTol, a broad-spectrum fungicide and algaecide, was shown be to 100% potent against nematodes living in a water suspension,<ref name=\"Jagdale 2002\"/> but the study does not show how nematodes are affected in soil or outside of a laboratory environment.\n\nAn alternative method of control is a hot water treatment, which affects all stages of the life cycle and can be used on whole plants.  This treatment has been used for 60 years with some effect in greenhouse plants, but not on a widespread agricultural level.  The difficulty in this treatment is that exposure times to hot water and the temperature of the water must be optimized so that the nematodes are killed, but the cultivar remains undamaged.  One study, which researched five California strawberry cultivars including Chandler, Douglas, Fern, Pajaro, and Selva, demonstrated that the minimum-maximum exposure times and temperatures that killed the nematodes but did not harm the cultivars were: 20\u201330 minutes at 44.4\u2070C, 10\u201315 minutes at 46.1\u2070C, and 8\u201310 minutes at 47.7\u2070.  The study also found that fruit production was more sensitive to the treatment than mere survival of the plant, so the minimum exposure times are recommended when using plants for fruit production, and the maximum time is recommended when using plants for propagation.<ref name=\"Qui 1993\"/>\n\nOne of the best and most practiced forms of management to reduce the local and geographical spread of the disease is sanitation.  Removing the infected leaves of the plant can reduce spread in the individual plant, but because the nematode is found in most foliar tissue the nematodes may already be present in other tissues before the leaf symptoms appear.  The nematodes can also move on the outside of the plant surface when water is present, so the nematodes can move around the outside surface of the plant and infect new tissues.  Therefore, once plants show any signs of infection, they should be removed and destroyed.<ref name=\"Davis 2008\"/>  Reducing or eliminating overhead irrigation can prevent dispersal of the nematode through water splashing, and keeping the foliage dry prevents the nematodes from moving on the outside of the plant.  Plants should be placed further apart to allow water to dry quickly after irrigation.  In the greenhouse or nursery, soils, containers, and tools should be sterilized on a regular basis, and the floor and storage areas should be free from plant debris.<ref name=\"Hartman 2006\"/>\n\nThe most important form of management is prevention of introduction of the nematode to the environment.  One should avoid planting infected plants, and it is recommended that new plants (especially in a personal lawn or greenhouse) be planted in an isolated area to monitor the plant for the development of symptoms before transplanting the plant near established plants.  This will prevent the established plants from getting infected from a new, infected plant.  All symptomatic plants should be destroyed immediately.  Dead plant material should also be handled with caution. Vermiform nematodes can survive and reproduce in compost piles of dead plant material by feeding on fungi that are commonly found in compost.  As a result, infected plants should be burned and sterilized to prevent the nematodes from infecting soil (which results directly from burying the material), or other plants (from allowing the plant to remain rooted in the soil near other plants as it dies).<ref name=\"Hartman 2006\"/>\n\n== Hosts ==\nSee:\n\n* [[List of African daisy diseases]]\n* [[List of African violet diseases]]\n* [[List of cyclamen diseases]]\n* [[List of foliage plant diseases (Polypodiaceae)]]\n* [[List of geranium diseases]]\n* [[List of primula diseases]]\n* [[List of strawberry diseases]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www7.inra.fr/hyppz/RAVAGEUR/3aphfra.htm ''Aphelenchoides fragariae'' at INRA (French)]\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3719522}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aphelenchoides Fragariae}}\n[[Category:Agricultural pest nematodes]]\n[[Category:Strawberry pests]]\n[[Category:Ornamental plant pathogens and diseases]]\n[[Category:Aphelenchoides|fragariae]]\n[[Category:Tylenchida]]\n[[Category:Plant pathogenic nematodes]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{Taxobox\n| name               = Strawberry foliar nematode\n| regnum             = [[Animal]]ia\n| phylum             = [[Nematoda]]\n| classis            = [[Secernentea]]\n| subclassis         = [[Diplogasteria]]\n| ordo               = [[Tylenchida]]\n| superfamilia = [[Aphelenchoidea]]\n| familia            = [[Aphelenchoididae]]\n| subfamilia         = [[Aphelenchoidinae]]\n| genus              = ''[[Aphelenchoides]]''\n| species            = '''''A. fragariae'''''\n| binomial           = ''Aphelenchoides fragariae''\n| binomial_authority = (Ritzema Bos, 1891) Christie, 1932\n}}\n\n'''Strawberry foliar nematode''', or '''strawberry crimp nematode''', is a disease caused by '''''Aphelenchoides fragariae''''', a plant pathogenic nematode. it is common in strawberries and ornamental plants and can greatly affect plant yield and appearance, resulting in a loss of millions of dollars of revenue.

As a result, infected plants should be burned and sterilized to prevent the nematodes from infecting soil (which results directly from burying the material), or other plants (from allowing the plant to remain rooted in the soil near other plants as it dies).<ref name=\"Hartman 2006\"/>\n\n== Hosts ==\nSee:\n\n* [[List of African daisy diseases]]\n* [[List of African violet diseases]]\n* [[List of cyclamen diseases]]\n* [[List of foliage plant diseases (Polypodiaceae)]]\n* [[List of geranium diseases]]\n* [[List of primula diseases]]\n* [[List of strawberry diseases]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www7.inra.fr/hyppz/RAVAGEUR/3aphfra.htm ''Aphelenchoides fragariae'' at INRA (French)]\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3719522}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aphelenchoides Fragariae}}\n[[Category:Agricultural pest nematodes]]\n[[Category:Strawberry pests]]\n[[Category:Ornamental plant pathogens and diseases]]\n[[Category:Aphelenchoides|fragariae]]\n[[Category:Tylenchida]]\n[[Category:Plant pathogenic nematodes]]\n", "name_user": "William Avery", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixeddashesusing ascript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_foliar_nematode"}
