the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), [[President of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC), and [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the highest-ranking official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]]. Xi was [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice president]] from 2008 to 2013 and [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|vice chairman of the Central Military Commission]] from 2010 to 2012.\n\nXi is the first [[List of general secretaries and chairmen of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] born after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment]] of the People's Republic of China. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]]. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].\n\nAs the central figure of the [[Generations of Chinese leadership|fifth generation of leadership]] of the People's Republic,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217211144/http://www.giga-hamburg.de/dl/download.php?d=%2Fcontent%2Fias%2Farchiv%2Fcds%2Fcds_0905.pdf|title=Journal of Current Chinese Affairs|last=|first=|date=May 2009|website=giga-hamburg.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=17 February 2012|accessdate=20 October 2010}}</ref> Xi has significantly centralised institutional power by taking on a wide range of leadership positions, including chairing the newly formed [[National Security Commission of the Communist Party of China|National Security Commission]], as well as new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet.

The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people. Xi believes that, just as the party must be at the apex of political control of the state, the party's central authorities (i.e., the Politburo, PSC, or himself as general secretary) must exercise

the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), [[President of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC), and [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the highest-ranking official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]]. Xi was [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice president]] from 2008 to 2013 and [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|vice chairman of the Central Military Commission]] from 2010 to 2012.\n\nXi is the first [[List of general secretaries and chairmen of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] born after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment]] of the People's Republic of China. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]]. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].\n\nAs the central figure of the [[Generations of Chinese leadership|fifth generation of leadership]] of the People's Republic,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217211144/http://www.giga-hamburg.de/dl/download.php?d=%2Fcontent%2Fias%2Farchiv%2Fcds%2Fcds_0905.pdf|title=Journal of Current Chinese Affairs|last=|first=|date=May 2009|website=giga-hamburg.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=17 February 2012|accessdate=20 October 2010}}</ref> Xi has significantly centralised institutional power by taking on a wide range of leadership positions, including chairing the newly formed [[National Security Commission of the Communist Party of China|National Security Commission]], as well as new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet.

However, Xi and his colleagues acknowledge the challenges to the legitimacy of Communist rule, particularly corruption by party officials. The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people. Xi believes that, just as the party must be at the apex of political control of the state, the party's central authorities (i.e., the Politburo, PSC, or himself as general secretary) must exercise

{"title_page": "Yo-yo club", "text_new": "{{short description|Sporting side that is regularly promoted and relegated}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2009}}\n[[File:Positionen FCN am Saisonende.png|thumb|Annual season-end ranking of German club [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]], with seven promotions and eight relegations since 1963]]\nA '''yo-yo club''' is a sporting side that is regularly [[promotion and relegation|promoted and relegated]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-yoyo-clubs-fight-the-twilight-zone-1169971.html |title=football yoyo clubs fight the twilight zone | publisher=The Independent|accessdate= 6 April 2014}}</ref> The phrase is most typically used in [[association football]] in the United Kingdom, especially in reference to promotion to and relegation from the [[Premier League]].\n\nThe name is derived from the toy [[yo-yo]] which goes up and down a string. In [[Germany]] the equivalent term is ''Fahrstuhlmannschaft'', in [[Greece]] it is ''\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c3\u03ad\u03c1'', in hispanic countries it is ''equipo [[Elevator|ascensor]]'', in Danish ''elevatorhold'' and in Russia they often say ''\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430-\u043b\u0438\u0444\u0442'', all five of them literally meaning \"lift team\" or \"elevator team\".  In the Netherlands the term is ''heen-en-weer club'' (to-and-fro club). In Polish, yo-yo clubs are referred to as ''wa\u0144ka-wsta\u0144ka'', which translates to \"[[roly-poly toy]]\". In Romanian, clubs oscillating between the first and second tier are called ''ABBA'', in reference to these leagues' former names, [[Liga I|Divizia A]] and [[Liga II|Divizia B]].\n\nIn England the phrase has been used to describe, among others, [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], [[Norwich City]], [[Queens Park Rangers]], [[Newcastle United]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].\n\nWest Brom were an archetypal yo-yo club throughout the first decade of the 21st-century, during which time they were promoted four times and relegated three times.  This was seen by some to be a direct result of the policies espoused by the club's chairman [[Jeremy Peace]], who refused to allow the club to spend beyond its means and has insisted on sound financial management.  This tended to leave the club at a disadvantage in the Premier League, when other similarly-sized clubs have tended to spend beyond their means, but strongly placed in the second tier ([[EFL Championship|The Championship]]) due to the [[Parachute payment (Sports)|parachute payments]] received on relegation from the Premier League. West Brom has recently been relegated yet again from the Premier League, proving themselves as a yo-yo club.  Likewise Crystal Palace reached the Premier League five times, were relegated the following season on the first four occasions, but have now survived since 2013.\n\n==England==\n\n=== Birmingham City ===\n[[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] have been promoted to and relegated from the top division more times than any other English club, with 12 promotions and 12 relegations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caughtoffside.com/2009/08/12/birmingham-city-constant-yo-yo-club-or-finally-some-progress/ |title=Birmingham City: Constant Yo-Yo Club? or Finally Some Progress? |publisher=CaughtOffside.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06}}</ref>\n\nBirmingham's longest period in one division has been 18 years in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], from 1921 to 1939.  Their next longest was 10 years, also in the First Division, between 1955 and 1965.\n\nElected to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] in 1892, Birmingham were promoted to Division One in 1894 and relegated in 1896.  Their next promotion came in 1901, and was followed immediately by relegation in 1902 and a third promotion in 1903.  This time they lasted five years in the First Division, before relegation in 1908.\n\nThe following seventy years (which included breaks for the two [[world war]]s) were comparatively stable, with only three relegations and four promotions.  After their seventh relegation, in 1979, they were promoted at the first attempt; the same happened in 1984 and 1985, but after their ninth relegation, in 1986, they spent 16 years out of the top flight.\n\nDuring these 16 seasons Birmingham had two separate spells in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]: from 1989 to 1992 (three seasons), and from 1994 to 1995 (one season).\n\nThey were promoted to the Premier League for the first time in 2002.  Their first spell in this league lasted four years, but in the four years from 2006 to 2009 they were relegated twice and promoted twice.\n\nIn 2011 they were relegated again, and this was the eighth time since 1979 that this had happened to Birmingham.  Six of these relegations were between the top two divisions, and two were between the second and third. They have remained in the Championship since.\n\n===Brighton & Hove Albion===\n\n[[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] have had only, until 2017, one brief spell in the top flight of English football, from 1979 to 1983, but in the 53 years since 1958 they have been relegated nine times and promoted ten times.\n\nFounder members of the [[Football League Third Division]] in 1920, they remained at that level ([[Third Division South]] from 1921) for 31 seasons (38 years, including the break for [[World War II]]).  Since 1958, the longest period they have spent in any one division has been seven years in the Third, from 1965 to 1972.\n\nAfter winning promotion to the Second Division for the first time in 1958, they suffered consecutive relegations in 1962 and 1963 to reach the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] for the first time. (The Fourth Division was created in 1958.)  Sixteen years later (in 1979) they reached the other extreme when they won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] for the first time, but 17 years after that (1996) they were back in the fourth tier of English football (now known as the Third Division).\n\nIn the six years from 2001 to 2006 Brighton experienced three promotions and two relegations, leaving them in the third tier (now known as [[EFL League One|Football League One]]), and in 2011 they were promoted to [[EFL Championship|the Championship]] for the first time.\n\nIn 2017, Brighton finally achieved promotion back into the top flight for the first time in 34 years,  finishing 2nd and gaining automatic promotion.\n\n===Hull City===\n[[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] have been promoted to the Premier League in 2008, 2013 and 2016, with relegations to the Championship in 2010, 2015 and 2017.\n\n===Leicester City===\n\n[[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] had three separate spells in the Premier League between 1994 and 2004.  The second lasted six years (1996 to 2002), but the other two only one year each (1994-5 and 2003-4).  After each of the first two relegations they returned to the Premier League after only one season, but after being relegated in 2004, they were out of the top flight for ten seasons, until their promotion in 2014.  In 2008 they were relegated to League One (the old [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]) for the first time, but they were promoted back to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] at the first attempt. The team eventually was promoted back to the Premier League in 2013\u201314, making a total of five promotions and three relegations in 20 years. They have remained in the Premier League ever since their last promotion, including winning the title in [[2015\u201316 Premier League|2015\u201316]], the first league trophy overall for Leicester.\n\n===Manchester City===\nOf the 107 seasons that [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] have spent in the [[English Football League]], only 25 have been outside the top flight.  But in the 18 years from 1983 to 2001, they were relegated from the top flight four times; and they even spent one season in the [[Football League Third Division|third tier]].\n\nFounder members of the [[Football League Second Division]] in 1892, City gained promotion to the First Division for the first time in 1899.  They spent 63 of the following 73 seasons in the First Division (the top tier), despite suffering relegation six times \u2013 of their six spells in the Second Division over this period, the longest was three years, from 1963 to 1966.  But they were relegated twice in the 1980s, and two years after another relegation in 1996 they dropped into the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] (then known as the Second Division) for the first time in their history \u2013 their only season at that level, to date, being 1998\u201399.\n\nCity have now been back in the Premier League since 2002 and, since being bought by [[Sheikh Mansour]] of the [[Abu Dhabi royal family]], have won four [[Premier League]] titles (2012, 2014, 2018 and 2019) in the last 8 seasons.\n\n===Middlesbrough===\n[[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] changed divisions ten times in the sixteen years from 1982 to 1998.\n\nFollowing relegation in 1954 they had been out of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] for twenty years, and had dropped into the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first time in their history (1966\u201397).\n\nAfter regaining their First Division place in 1974 they were relegated again in 1982, and in 1986 they dropped into the Third Division again.  This time they almost went out of business, but they quickly recovered and two successive promotions took them back into the First Division by 1988. They lasted only one season, and spent three more years in the Second Division before winning promotion to the newly created Premier League in 1992.\n\nThey stayed there for only one season, but regained their Premier League place two years later as First Division champions. Two years later, despite investing over ten million pounds in transfer fees for famous international players, a three-point penalty for failing to fulfil a fixture cost Boro their Premier League status. This time they regained it at the first attempt, and they held on to it for eleven years, but played seven consecutive seasons in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] following relegation in 2009. Middlesbrough gained promotion as Championship [[Runner-up|runners-up]] in the [[2015\u201316 Football League Championship|2015\u201316]] campaign only to suffer another relegation in the following season.\n\n===Millwall===\n[[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] have yo-yoed between the second and third tier of English Football throughout their 92 consecutive [[List of Millwall F.C. seasons|seasons in the Football League]]. They have spent two seasons in the top tier, 42 in the second, 43 in the third and five in the fourth tier. They have been promoted eleven times (five as champions) and relegated ten times. They've been promoted a record eight times from the third tier, and relegated six times from the second tier.<ref name=\"Millwall Stat Zone\">{{Cite web\n| title = Millwall Stat Zone\n| url = http://www.millwall-history.co.uk/Millwall-Stats.htm\n| work = The Millwall History Files\n| accessdate =21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Northampton Town===\nWhen the regional divisions were scrapped in 1957, the club was placed in Division Four. The 1960s proved to be a remarkable decade for the club.\n\nPromoted in 1961, Northampton were Division Three champions in 1963 and in 1965 they won promotion to the First Division. \nHaving risen from the Fourth to the First Divisions, their decline was equally spectacular.\n\nRelegated after one season at the top, by 1972 they were applying for re-election to the Fourth Division.\n\n<ref>http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Northampton_Town/Northampton_Town.htm</ref>\n\n===Norwich City===\nIn [[1971\u201372 in English football|1971\u201372]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] won the second tier and reached the top flight for the first time.  In the next 23 seasons the club was relegated to the second tier three times ([[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374]], [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], [[1984\u201385 in English football|1984\u201385]]) but they always bounced back to the top flight at the first attempt ([[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]], [[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]], [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386]]).  Since being relegated in [[1994\u201395 FA Premier League|1994\u201395]], the club has been promoted a total of five times ([[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304]], [[2009\u201310 in English football|2009\u201310]], [[2010\u201311 in English football|2010\u201311]], [[2014\u201315 in English football|2014\u201315]], [[2018-19 in English football|2018\u201319]]) and relegated five times ([[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]], [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309]], [[2013\u201314 in English football|2013\u201314]], [[2015\u201316 in English football|2015\u201316]]), with one of those seasons ([[2009\u201310 in English football|2009\u201310]]) spent in the third tier.\n\nManagers of the team that have celebrated promotion in the Premier League era are [[Nigel Worthington]] (2003\u201304), [[Paul Lambert]] (2009\u201310, 2010\u201311), [[Alex Neil (football)|Alex Neil]] (2014\u201315) and [[Daniel Farke]] (2018\u201319), whereas managers in the same era suffering relegation have been [[Gary Megson]] (1994\u201395), [[Nigel Worthington]] (2004\u201305), [[Bryan Gunn]] (2008\u201309), [[Neil Adams (footballer)|Neil Adams]] (2013\u201314) and [[Alex Neil (football)|Alex Neil]] (2015\u201316).\n\nIn 2018, Gregor Robertson, writing in [[The Times]], described Norwich City as \"The perennial yo-yo club\".<ref>https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/norwich-city-dreaming-of-the-big-time-again-kxj7dxqlz</ref>\n\n=== Notts County ===\n\nOfficially, Notts County are the biggest yo-yo club of the lot \u2013 switching divisions a total of 29 times in their history; with 13 promotions and 16 relegations.\n\nPromotion years: 1897, 1914, 1923, 1931, 1950, 1960, 1971, 1973, 1981, 1990, 1991, 1998, 2010\n\nRelegation years: 1893, 1913, 1920, 1926, 1930, 1935, 1958, 1959, 1964, 1984, 1985, 1992, 1995, 1997, 2004, 2015, 2019.\n\nNotts County have spent a total of 30 seasons in the top flight of English football, all of which were in Division 1. They have never played in the Premiership, as they suffered relegation from the old First Division the season before it became the Premiership. They have spent a further 37 seasons in the second tier, 31 in the third tier, and 15 in the fourth tier. After the 2018\u201319 season, they dropped into the [[National League (division)|National League]] for the first time in their history.\n\n===Sheffield Wednesday===\nPrior to World War II, [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] were one of England's most successful clubs; they won their fourth [[English Football League|Football League]] title in 1930, and they won the [[F.A. Cup]] for the third time in 1935.  But they were relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1937, and after promotion in 1950 they experienced three more relegations in the next eight years: in 1951, 1955, and 1958.  Each time they \nwon promotion at the first attempt, and it was their manager [[Eric Taylor (football manager)|Eric Taylor]] who referred to this period as \"the yo-yo years\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Stats|url=http://www.swfc.co.uk/stats/historicalstats.aspx|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter their fourth promotion in nine years, in 1959, Wednesday remained in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] until 1970 (and came close to winning their fourth F.A. Cup in 1966, when they lost a memorable final to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]).  But in 1975 they dropped into the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first time, and in 2010 they began their third spell at this level. However, in May 2012, they were promoted back to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]]. Since 1970 they have had two periods in the top flight \u2013 totalling 14 seasons \u2013 but they have never yet repeated the frequent ups and downs of the 1950s.\n\n===Watford===\nFollowing promotion from the Southern League at the end of the 1919\u201320 season, [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] spent their existence in the Football League's basement Third Division South, restructured to the Fourth Division for the 1958\u201359 Season, before achieving their first promotion within the Football League structure, to the Third Division, at the end of 1959\u201360. Watford spent nine seasons at this level before a further promotion to the Second Division at the end of 1968\u201369. However, their stay at this level was short-lived and they were twice relegated, at the end of the 1971\u201372 and 1974\u201375 seasons, to sink back to the Fourth Division.\n\nUnder the auspices of Chairman, Elton John and Manager, Graham Taylor, Watford achieved promotions in consecutive seasons between 1977 and 1979 to reach the Second Division once again. This was followed by three seasons at that level, culminating in achieving runners-up position in 1981\u201382 and promotion to the First Division.\n\nWatford were league runners-up in their first season as a First Division club, and were F.A Cup losing finalists a year later. But they were back in the Second Division come 1988\u201389, and slipped into the third tier of the league (by then the new Football League Division Two) at the end of the 1995\u201396 season. They were promoted back to Division One two years later after winning the Division Two title, and a Division One playoff triumph the following year earned them promotion to the Premiership.\n\nWatford were unable to adjust to the pace of Premiership football and were relegated at the end of their first top-flight season in more than a decade. They won the Championship playoff in 2005\u201306, but last place in the Premiership the following season ensured their 11th movement in 25 seasons. After finishing runners-up in the Championship in 2014\u201315, Watford were promoted once again and competed in the Premier League in 2015\u201316. The club finished 13th, thereby maintaining Premier League status for the first time, and subsequently finished 17th, 14th and 11th in its next three Premier League seasons, while also reaching an FA Cup final.\n\n===West Bromwich Albion===\nSince 2002, [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] have provided a classic example of the yo-yo. Between 2002 and 2010 they were promoted to the [[Premier League]] four times and relegated back to [[Football League First Division|Division One (known since 2004 as The Championship)]] three times, and 2011 was the first year since 1999 that they were not involved in either a promotion or a relegation battle, in most cases right up to the last match of the season.\n\nAlbion were promoted in 2002, relegated in 2003, promoted in 2004, achieved what has become known as \"The Great Escape\" in 2005 when they became the first ever club to avoid relegation from the Premier League after being in bottom place at Christmas, relegated in 2006, lost the [[2007 Football League Championship play-off Final|2007 play-off Final]] to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], promoted in 2008, relegated in 2009 and promoted in 2010. They have remained in the Premier League until the end of the 2017\u201318 season when the club was relegated to the Championship once again.\n\nIn 2000 Albion had been in real danger of relegation to [[Football League Third Division|Division Two]] right up to the last day of the season, and in 2001 they reached the [[EFL Championship play-offs|Division One play-offs]], losing in the semi-finals to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. Albion had also spent two years in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] between 1991 and 1993, after being relegated from the top tier in 1986.\n\n===Wolverhampton Wanderers===\n[[Wolverhampton Wanderers|Wolves]] were one of the most famous yo-yo clubs during the 1980s. They began the decade on a high by winning the League Cup in 1980, only to suffer relegation to the Second Division and narrowly avoid bankruptcy two years later. They regained their First Division status at the first attempt, only to endure successive relegations over the next few seasons and slip into the Fourth Division for the first time in 1986. Fourth Division championship glory came two years later and the following year Wolves were Third Division champions and promoted to the Second Division. During the 1980s, Wolves had moved divisions seven times in eight seasons. They have spent all but one of their 17 subsequent seasons in the league's second tier (Second Division, Division One and now the Championship), having been in the Premier League during the 2003\u201304 season. Wolves won the Football League Championship title in 2009, but were relegated in 2012 after three seasons in the Premier League and relegated again a year later. Wolves finally returned to the Championship at the first attempt as League One champions in 2013\u201314, and were promoted to the Premier League following the 2017\u201318 season. They went on to finish 7th on their return, which was their best performance since 1979-80, and claimed victories over four of the [[Premier League#Emergence of the \"Big Six\" (2010s)|Big Six]]. Their league position was enough to qualify for the [[2019-20 UEFA Europa League]].\n\n===Overall total===\nThe table below shows the total number of relegations and promotions (of select clubs) between the top four tiers of English football as of the beginning of the [[2016-17 in English football|2016\u201317]] season.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!No.\n!width=150|Team\n!width=80|Promotions\n!width=80|Relegations\n!width=80|Total\n|-\n| 1\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]\n| 13\n| 16\n| 29\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]\n| 13\n| 16\n| 29\n|-\n| 3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]\n| 12\n| 12\n| 24\n|-\n| 4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]\n| 11\n| 11\n| 22\n|-\n| 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]\n| 11\n| 10\n| 21\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]\n| 11\n| 10\n| 21\n|-\n| 7\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]\n| 9\n| 11\n| 20\n|-\n| 8\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]\n| 9\n| 9\n| 18\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]\n| 9\n| 9\n| 18\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]\n| 9\n| 9\n| 18\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]\n| 9\n| 9\n| 18\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]\n| 8\n| 10\n| 18\n|-\n| 13\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]\n| 9\n| 8\n| 17\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]\n| 9\n| 8\n| 17\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]\n| 9\n| 8\n| 17\n|-\n| 16\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]\n| 9\n| 6\n| 15\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]\n| 9\n| 6\n| 15\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]\n| 7\n| 8\n| 15\n|-\n| 19\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]\n| 7\n| 7\n| 14\n|-\n| 20\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]\n| 7\n| 6\n| 13\n|-\n|}\n\n==Germany==\n[[File:Ligaplaetze Arminia Bielefelds seit 1963.svg|right|thumb|Season-end position for Arminia Bielefeld, 1963\u20132007]]\nIn German, yo-yo clubs are referred to as ''Fahrstuhlmannschaften'' (lit.

[[Arminia Bielefeld]] (14 moves), [[VfL Bochum]], [[Hertha BSC]] (both 12), [[Karlsruher SC]] and [[MSV Duisburg]] (both 11) each are also considered to be yo-yo clubs in German club football, as well as [[Hansa Rostock]] (16 moves) and [[Union Berlin]] (12) if the league system in the former [[East Germany]] is included in the statistics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/malagal.html |title=Up and Down! |publisher=Rsssf.com |date=2016-02-11 |accessdate=2018-07-18}}</ref> More recently, [[SC Paderborn 07]] has become a yo-yo club. In 2014, the club was promoted to the first division. In 2017, it barely avoided relegation to the fourth division. In 2019, Paderborn reached the first division once again.\n\n==Ghana==\n[[Bofoakwa Tano]] have been promoted or relegated nine times since finishing bottom in 1979. They were promoted back to the top flight in 1982, but were relegated again in 1985. The club reappeared in the top division in 1989\u201390, by which time the league had switched to winter. They were relegated again in 1990\u201391, promoted back in 1994\u201395, relegated in 1996\u201397, promoted in 1997\u201398. In 1999 they finished third from bottom, but avoided another relegation by winning a play-off. However, they were relegated again in 2006\u201307.\n\n==Hong Kong==\n[[Hong Kong FC (football)|Hong Kong Football Club]] has won many titles in the second-tier competition in Hong Kong Soccer League history, however, they have rarely enjoyed success when playing against the professional sides in top-tier competitions. Therefore, they have the local nickname ''the lift'' (Chinese: \u5347\u964d\u6a5f), which is the equivalent of the term Yo-yo club.\n\n==Ireland==\nIrish club [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]] are known as a yo-yo club due to the regular frequency of the club's relegation and promotion to and from the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] and [[League of Ireland First Division]]. [[Drogheda United F.C.|Drogheda United]] swapped Divisions every season between 1993/94 and 2000/01.\n\n==Netherlands==\n\nDutch football club [[FC Volendam]] are known as the ''Heen-en-weer club'' (The to-and-fro club): they won promotion from the [[Eerste Divisie]] to the [[Eredivisie]] in 1959, were relegated in 1960, were promoted in 1961, were relegated in 1964, were promoted in 1967, were relegated in 1969, were promoted in 1970, were relegated in 1972, were promoted in 1977, were relegated in 1979, were promoted in 1983, were relegated in 1985, were promoted in 1987, were relegated in 1998, were promoted in 2003 and were relegated in 2004. In 2008 FC Volendam promoted once again, only to finish last and be therefore relegated the following year. For the 2009\u201310 season, the club is playing in the Eerste Divisie.\n\n==Norway==\n\nStarting in 1979 and ending in 1987, [[SK Brann]] were promoted in every odd-numbered year and relegated in every even-numbered year.

They were promoted to the [[Polish First League]] in 1994 (known as ''Petrochemia P\u0142ock'' at the time), but were relegated after one season. Promoted again in 1997, they again were relegated after one season. Their next promotion came (after shortening their name to ''Petro P\u0142ock'') in 2000, and this time they managed to avoid relegation after one season. However, the next season (known now as ''Orlen P\u0142ock'') they were again relegated. In 2002, reverting to the original name ''Wis\u0142a P\u0142ock'', they were promoted to First League, and finally enjoyed relative stability, even reaching the [[Polish Cup]] final in 2003 and winning it in 2006. However, relegation was again in order in 2007. After that, they spent 3 years in the second tier before being relegated to the third in 2010. They immediately got promoted to the second tier, but got relegated from it again in 2012. They were once again promoted to the second tier the following season, spending 3 years in it, before finally returning to the Ekstraklasa in 2016. In spite of this \"yo-yoing,\" Wis\u0142a have avoided the fate of other relegated clubs in Poland, such as bankruptcy (e.g. [[Szczakowianka Jaworzno]]) or further relegation to lower divisions (e.g. [[Rak\u00f3w Cz\u0119stochowa]]).\n\n==Sweden==\nIn [[Sweden]] the term has been used especially for [[Hammarby IF]]'s men's soccer team but also [[Katrineholms SK Bandy|Katrineholms SK's men's bandy team]] during the early-mid 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/arkiv/sport/boltic-favorit-men-bandyhjartat-bloder-for-soders-broder/|title=Boltic favorit \u2013 men bandyhj\u00e4rtat bl\u00f6der f\u00f6r S\u00f6ders br\u00f6der|publisher=Dagens nyheter|language=Swedish|date=12 November 1995|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Turkey==\n\nIn Turkey, these kinds of clubs are called ''asans\u00f6r tak\u0131m'' (elevator team). [[Kar\u015f\u0131yaka S.K.]] relegated from first level in 1964, 1967, 1972, 1991, 1994 and 1996. Kar\u015f\u0131yaka also played in third level between 1973\u20131980 and 2001\u20132003. Also [[Sakaryaspor]] has an interesting statistic. They promoted in 1981, relegated in 1986. But they promoted again after the 1986\u201387 season. However they could only stay in first level for three seasons and relegated again in 1990. They came back to first level for a single season in 1998\u201399. They were back again in first level in 2004\u201305, but relegated same season. They won the 2005\u201306 play-offs and promoted to first level again, just to relegate after one season. They almost repeated same thing when they reached play-offs in 2007\u201308 but this time they lost and finally \"stayed\" in second level for a second season in row. Sakaryaspor later relegated to once to third level in 2008\u201309 season. Sakaryaspor returned second level after play-offs in the 2010\u201311 season but this return was brief due to money shortage. After two successive relegations between 2011 and 2013, they were placed in fourth level. all in all, [[Samsunspor]] was promoted to first level in 1969, 1976, 1982, 1985, 1991, 1993 and 2011 and relegated from first level in 1975, 1979, 1983, 1990, 1992, 2006 and 2012. Samsunspor currently plays in the [[TFF First League|First League]], which is second tier in the Turkish league system.\n\n[[Adanaspor]] is one of the most yo-yoed teams. They were promoted to first league in 1971, relegated in 1984, promoted again in 1988, relegated again in 1991, promoted in 1998, relegated in 2001 and promoted to first league last in 2002. They suffered from financial difficulties between 2003\u20132006 and were relegated to Third League, which is fourth level of Turkish league system in 2006 after three successive relegations. They also didn't win any match at third level in the 2005\u201306 season. But they recovered to [[Bank Asya First League]] in 2008 after two successive promotions.\n\n[[Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa S.K.]] is one of the recent yo-yo clubs, having been relegated from S\u00fcper Lig in 2008 and 2011, and promoted in 2007, 2009 and 2012. They also moved to and fro between [[Bank Asya First League]], the second tier of Turkish football, and [[TFF Second League]], the third level, before being promoted to S\u00fcper Lig.

In [[Germany]] the equivalent term is ''Fahrstuhlmannschaft'', in [[Greece]] it is ''\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c3\u03ad\u03c1'', in hispanic countries it is ''equipo [[Elevator|ascensor]]'', in Danish ''elevatorhold'' and in Russia they often say ''\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430-\u043b\u0438\u0444\u0442'', all five of them literally meaning \"lift team\" or \"elevator team\".  In the Netherlands the term is ''heen-en-weer club'' (to-and-fro club). In Polish, yo-yo clubs are referred to as ''wa\u0144ka-wsta\u0144ka'', which translates to \"[[roly-poly toy]]\". In Romanian, clubs oscillating between the first and second tier are called ''ABBA'', in reference to these leagues' former names, [[Liga I|Divizia A]] and [[Liga II|Divizia B]].\n\nIn England the phrase has been used to describe, among others, [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|, [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], [[Norwich City]], [[Queens Park Rangers]], [[Newcastle United]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].\n\nWest Brom were an archetypal yo-yo club throughout the first decade of the 21st-century, during which time they were promoted four times and relegated three times.  This was seen by some to be a direct result of the policies espoused by the club's chairman [[Jeremy Peace]], who refused to allow the club to spend beyond its means and has insisted on sound financial management.  This tended to leave the club at a disadvantage in the Premier League, when other similarly-sized clubs have tended to spend beyond their means, but strongly placed in the second tier ([[EFL Championship|The Championship]]) due to the [[Parachute payment (Sports)|parachute payments]] received on relegation from the Premier League. West Brom has recently been relegated yet again from the Premier League, proving themselves as a yo-yo club.  Likewise Crystal Palace reached the Premier League five times, were relegated the following season on the first four occasions, but have now survived since 2013.\n\n==England==\n\n=== Birmingham City ===\n[[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] have been promoted to and relegated from the top division more times than any other English club, with 12 promotions and 12 relegations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caughtoffside.com/2009/08/12/birmingham-city-constant-yo-yo-club-or-finally-some-progress/ |title=Birmingham City: Constant Yo-Yo Club? or Finally Some Progress? |publisher=CaughtOffside.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06}}</ref>\n\nBirmingham's longest period in one division has been 18 years in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], from 1921 to 1939.  Their next longest was 10 years, also in the First Division, between 1955 and 1965.\n\nElected to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] in 1892, Birmingham were promoted to Division One in 1894 and relegated in 1896.  Their next promotion came in 1901, and was followed immediately by relegation in 1902 and a third promotion in 1903.  This time they lasted five years in the First Division, before relegation in 1908.\n\nThe following seventy years (which included breaks for the two [[world war]]s) were comparatively stable, with only three relegations and four promotions.  After their seventh relegation, in 1979, they were promoted at the first attempt; the same happened in 1984 and 1985, but after their ninth relegation, in 1986, they spent 16 years out of the top flight.\n\nDuring these 16 seasons Birmingham had two separate spells in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]: from 1989 to 1992 (three seasons), and from 1994 to 1995 (one season).\n\nThey were promoted to the Premier League for the first time in 2002.  Their first spell in this league lasted four years, but in the four years from 2006 to 2009 they were relegated twice and promoted twice.\n\nIn 2011 they were relegated again, and this was the eighth time since 1979 that this had happened to Birmingham.  Six of these relegations were between the top two divisions, and two were between the second and third. They have remained in the Championship since.\n\n===Brighton & Hove Albion===\n\n[[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] have had only, until 2017, one brief spell in the top flight of English football, from 1979 to 1983, but in the 53 years since 1958 they have been relegated nine times and promoted ten times.\n\nFounder members of the [[Football League Third Division]] in 1920, they remained at that level ([[Third Division South]] from 1921) for 31 seasons (38 years, including the break for [[World War II]]).  Since 1958, the longest period they have spent in any one division has been seven years in the Third, from 1965 to 1972.\n\nAfter winning promotion to the Second Division for the first time in 1958, they suffered consecutive relegations in 1962 and 1963 to reach the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] for the first time. (The Fourth Division was created in 1958.)  Sixteen years later (in 1979) they reached the other extreme when they won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] for the first time, but 17 years after that (1996) they were back in the fourth tier of English football (now known as the Third Division).\n\nIn the six years from 2001 to 2006 Brighton experienced three promotions and two relegations, leaving them in the third tier (now known as [[EFL League One|Football League One]]), and in 2011 they were promoted to [[EFL Championship|the Championship]] for the first time.\n\nIn 2017, Brighton finally achieved promotion back into the top flight for the first time in 34 years,  finishing 2nd and gaining automatic promotion.\n\n===Hull City===\n[[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] have been promoted to the Premier League in 2008, 2013 and 2016, with relegations to the Championship in 2010, 2015 and 2017.\n\n===Leicester City===\n\n[[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] had three separate spells in the Premier League between 1994 and 2004.  The second lasted six years (1996 to 2002), but the other two only one year each (1994-5 and 2003-4).  After each of the first two relegations they returned to the Premier League after only one season, but after being relegated in 2004, they were out of the top flight for ten seasons, until their promotion in 2014.  In 2008 they were relegated to League One (the old [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]) for the first time, but they were promoted back to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] at the first attempt. The team eventually was promoted back to the Premier League in 2013\u201314, making a total of five promotions and three relegations in 20 years. They have remained in the Premier League ever since their last promotion, including winning the title in [[2015\u201316 Premier League|2015\u201316]], the first league trophy overall for Leicester.\n\n===Manchester City===\nOf the 107 seasons that [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] have spent in the [[English Football League]], only 25 have been outside the top flight.  But in the 18 years from 1983 to 2001, they were relegated from the top flight four times; and they even spent one season in the [[Football League Third Division|third tier]].\n\nFounder members of the [[Football League Second Division]] in 1892, City gained promotion to the First Division for the first time in 1899.  They spent 63 of the following 73 seasons in the First Division (the top tier), despite suffering relegation six times \u2013 of their six spells in the Second Division over this period, the longest was three years, from 1963 to 1966.  But they were relegated twice in the 1980s, and two years after another relegation in 1996 they dropped into the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] (then known as the Second Division) for the first time in their history \u2013 their only season at that level, to date, being 1998\u201399.\n\nCity have now been back in the Premier League since 2002 and, since being bought by [[Sheikh Mansour]] of the [[Abu Dhabi royal family]], have won four [[Premier League]] titles (2012, 2014, 2018 and 2019) in the last 8 seasons.\n\n===Middlesbrough===\n[[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] changed divisions ten times in the sixteen years from 1982 to 1998.\n\nFollowing relegation in 1954 they had been out of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] for twenty years, and had dropped into the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first time in their history (1966\u201397).\n\nAfter regaining their First Division place in 1974 they were relegated again in 1982, and in 1986 they dropped into the Third Division again.  This time they almost went out of business, but they quickly recovered and two successive promotions took them back into the First Division by 1988. They lasted only one season, and spent three more years in the Second Division before winning promotion to the newly created Premier League in 1992.\n\nThey stayed there for only one season, but regained their Premier League place two years later as First Division champions. Two years later, despite investing over ten million pounds in transfer fees for famous international players, a three-point penalty for failing to fulfil a fixture cost Boro their Premier League status. This time they regained it at the first attempt, and they held on to it for eleven years, but played seven consecutive seasons in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] following relegation in 2009. Middlesbrough gained promotion as Championship [[Runner-up|runners-up]] in the [[2015\u201316 Football League Championship|2015\u201316]] campaign only to suffer another relegation in the following season.\n\n===Millwall===\n[[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] have yo-yoed between the second and third tier of English Football throughout their 92 consecutive [[List of Millwall F.C. seasons|seasons in the Football League]]. They have spent two seasons in the top tier, 42 in the second, 43 in the third and five in the fourth tier. They have been promoted eleven times (five as champions) and relegated ten times. They've been promoted a record eight times from the third tier, and relegated six times from the second tier.<ref name=\"Millwall Stat Zone\">{{Cite web\n| title = Millwall Stat Zone\n| url = http://www.millwall-history.co.uk/Millwall-Stats.htm\n| work = The Millwall History Files\n| accessdate =21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Northampton Town===\nWhen the regional divisions were scrapped in 1957, the club was placed in Division Four. The 1960s proved to be a remarkable decade for the club.\n\nPromoted in 1961, Northampton were Division Three champions in 1963 and in 1965 they won promotion to the First Division. \nHaving risen from the Fourth to the First Divisions, their decline was equally spectacular.\n\nRelegated after one season at the top, by 1972 they were applying for re-election to the Fourth Division.\n\n<ref>http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Northampton_Town/Northampton_Town.htm</ref>\n\n===Norwich City===\nIn [[1971\u201372 in English football|1971\u201372]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] won the second tier and reached the top flight for the first time.  In the next 23 seasons the club was relegated to the second tier three times ([[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374]], [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], [[1984\u201385 in English football|1984\u201385]]) but they always bounced back to the top flight at the first attempt ([[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]], [[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]], [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386]]).  Since being relegated in [[1994\u201395 FA Premier League|1994\u201395]], the club has been promoted a total of five times ([[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304]], [[2009\u201310 in English football|2009\u201310]], [[2010\u201311 in English football|2010\u201311]], [[2014\u201315 in English football|2014\u201315]], [[2018-19 in English football|2018\u201319]]) and relegated five times ([[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]], [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309]], [[2013\u201314 in English football|2013\u201314]], [[2015\u201316 in English football|2015\u201316]]), with one of those seasons ([[2009\u201310 in English football|2009\u201310]]) spent in the third tier.\n\nManagers of the team that have celebrated promotion in the Premier League era are [[Nigel Worthington]] (2003\u201304), [[Paul Lambert]] (2009\u201310, 2010\u201311), [[Alex Neil (football)|Alex Neil]] (2014\u201315) and [[Daniel Farke]] (2018\u201319), whereas managers in the same era suffering relegation have been [[Gary Megson]] (1994\u201395), [[Nigel Worthington]] (2004\u201305), [[Bryan Gunn]] (2008\u201309), [[Neil Adams (footballer)|Neil Adams]] (2013\u201314) and [[Alex Neil (football)|Alex Neil]] (2015\u201316).\n\nIn 2018, Gregor Robertson, writing in [[The Times]], described Norwich City as \"The perennial yo-yo club\".<ref>https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/norwich-city-dreaming-of-the-big-time-again-kxj7dxqlz</ref>\n\n=== Notts County ===\n\nOfficially, Notts County are the biggest yo-yo club of the lot \u2013 switching divisions a total of 29 times in their history; with 13 promotions and 16 relegations.\n\nPromotion years: 1897, 1914, 1923, 1931, 1950, 1960, 1971, 1973, 1981, 1990, 1991, 1998, 2010\n\nRelegation years: 1893, 1913, 1920, 1926, 1930, 1935, 1958, 1959, 1964, 1984, 1985, 1992, 1995, 1997, 2004, 2015, 2019.\n\nNotts County have spent a total of 30 seasons in the top flight of English football, all of which were in Division 1. They have never played in the Premiership, as they suffered relegation from the old First Division the season before it became the Premiership. They have spent a further 37 seasons in the second tier, 31 in the third tier, and 15 in the fourth tier. After the 2018\u201319 season, they dropped into the [[National League (division)|National League]] for the first time in their history.\n\n===Sheffield Wednesday===\nPrior to World War II, [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] were one of England's most successful clubs; they won their fourth [[English Football League|Football League]] title in 1930, and they won the [[F.A. Cup]] for the third time in 1935.  But they were relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1937, and after promotion in 1950 they experienced three more relegations in the next eight years: in 1951, 1955, and 1958.  Each time they \nwon promotion at the first attempt, and it was their manager [[Eric Taylor (football manager)|Eric Taylor]] who referred to this period as \"the yo-yo years\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Stats|url=http://www.swfc.co.uk/stats/historicalstats.aspx|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter their fourth promotion in nine years, in 1959, Wednesday remained in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] until 1970 (and came close to winning their fourth F.A. Cup in 1966, when they lost a memorable final to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]).  But in 1975 they dropped into the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first time, and in 2010 they began their third spell at this level. However, in May 2012, they were promoted back to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]]. Since 1970 they have had two periods in the top flight \u2013 totalling 14 seasons \u2013 but they have never yet repeated the frequent ups and downs of the 1950s.\n\n===Watford===\nFollowing promotion from the Southern League at the end of the 1919\u201320 season, [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] spent their existence in the Football League's basement Third Division South, restructured to the Fourth Division for the 1958\u201359 Season, before achieving their first promotion within the Football League structure, to the Third Division, at the end of 1959\u201360. Watford spent nine seasons at this level before a further promotion to the Second Division at the end of 1968\u201369. However, their stay at this level was short-lived and they were twice relegated, at the end of the 1971\u201372 and 1974\u201375 seasons, to sink back to the Fourth Division.\n\nUnder the auspices of Chairman, Elton John and Manager, Graham Taylor, Watford achieved promotions in consecutive seasons between 1977 and 1979 to reach the Second Division once again. This was followed by three seasons at that level, culminating in achieving runners-up position in 1981\u201382 and promotion to the First Division.\n\nWatford were league runners-up in their first season as a First Division club, and were F.A Cup losing finalists a year later. But they were back in the Second Division come 1988\u201389, and slipped into the third tier of the league (by then the new Football League Division Two) at the end of the 1995\u201396 season. They were promoted back to Division One two years later after winning the Division Two title, and a Division One playoff triumph the following year earned them promotion to the Premiership.\n\nWatford were unable to adjust to the pace of Premiership football and were relegated at the end of their first top-flight season in more than a decade. They won the Championship playoff in 2005\u201306, but last place in the Premiership the following season ensured their 11th movement in 25 seasons. After finishing runners-up in the Championship in 2014\u201315, Watford were promoted once again and competed in the Premier League in 2015\u201316. The club finished 13th, thereby maintaining Premier League status for the first time, and subsequently finished 17th, 14th and 11th in its next three Premier League seasons, while also reaching an FA Cup final.\n\n===West Bromwich Albion===\nSince 2002, [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] have provided a classic example of the yo-yo. Between 2002 and 2010 they were promoted to the [[Premier League]] four times and relegated back to [[Football League First Division|Division One (known since 2004 as The Championship)]] three times, and 2011 was the first year since 1999 that they were not involved in either a promotion or a relegation battle, in most cases right up to the last match of the season.\n\nAlbion were promoted in 2002, relegated in 2003, promoted in 2004, achieved what has become known as \"The Great Escape\" in 2005 when they became the first ever club to avoid relegation from the Premier League after being in bottom place at Christmas, relegated in 2006, lost the [[2007 Football League Championship play-off Final|2007 play-off Final]] to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], promoted in 2008, relegated in 2009 and promoted in 2010. They have remained in the Premier League until the end of the 2017\u201318 season when the club was relegated to the Championship once again.\n\nIn 2000 Albion had been in real danger of relegation to [[Football League Third Division|Division Two]] right up to the last day of the season, and in 2001 they reached the [[EFL Championship play-offs|Division One play-offs]], losing in the semi-finals to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. Albion had also spent two years in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] between 1991 and 1993, after being relegated from the top tier in 1986.\n\n===Wolverhampton Wanderers===\n[[Wolverhampton Wanderers|Wolves]] were one of the most famous yo-yo clubs during the 1980s. They began the decade on a high by winning the League Cup in 1980, only to suffer relegation to the Second Division and narrowly avoid bankruptcy two years later. They regained their First Division status at the first attempt, only to endure successive relegations over the next few seasons and slip into the Fourth Division for the first time in 1986. Fourth Division championship glory came two years later and the following year Wolves were Third Division champions and promoted to the Second Division. During the 1980s, Wolves had moved divisions seven times in eight seasons. They have spent all but one of their 17 subsequent seasons in the league's second tier (Second Division, Division One and now the Championship), having been in the Premier League during the 2003\u201304 season. Wolves won the Football League Championship title in 2009, but were relegated in 2012 after three seasons in the Premier League and relegated again a year later. Wolves finally returned to the Championship at the first attempt as League One champions in 2013\u201314, and were promoted to the Premier League following the 2017\u201318 season. They went on to finish 7th on their return, which was their best performance since 1979-80, and claimed victories over four of the [[Premier League#Emergence of the \"Big Six\" (2010s)|Big Six]]. Their league position was enough to qualify for the [[2019-20 UEFA Europa League]].\n\n===Overall total===\nThe table below shows the total number of relegations and promotions (of select clubs) between the top four tiers of English football as of the beginning of the [[2016-17 in English football|2016\u201317]] season.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!No.\n!width=150|Team\n!width=80|Promotions\n!width=80|Relegations\n!width=80|Total\n|-\n| 1\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]\n| 13\n| 16\n| 29\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]\n| 13\n| 16\n| 29\n|-\n| 3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]\n| 12\n| 12\n| 24\n|-\n| 4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]\n| 11\n| 11\n| 22\n|-\n| 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]\n| 11\n| 10\n| 21\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]\n| 11\n| 10\n| 21\n|-\n| 7\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]\n| 9\n| 11\n| 20\n|-\n| 8\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]\n| 9\n| 9\n| 18\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]\n| 9\n| 9\n| 18\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]\n| 9\n| 9\n| 18\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]\n| 9\n| 9\n| 18\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]\n| 8\n| 10\n| 18\n|-\n| 13\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]\n| 9\n| 8\n| 17\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]\n| 9\n| 8\n| 17\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]\n| 9\n| 8\n| 17\n|-\n| 16\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]\n| 9\n| 6\n| 15\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]\n| 9\n| 6\n| 15\n|-\n| =\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]\n| 7\n| 8\n| 15\n|-\n| 19\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]\n| 7\n| 7\n| 14\n|-\n| 20\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]\n| 7\n| 6\n| 13\n|-\n|}\n\n==Germany==\n[[File:Ligaplaetze Arminia Bielefelds seit 1963.svg|right|thumb|Season-end position for Arminia Bielefeld, 1963\u20132007]]\nIn German, yo-yo clubs are referred to as ''Fahrstuhlmannschaften'' (lit.

In 1999 they finished third from bottom, but avoided another relegation by winning a play-off. However, they were relegated again in 2006\u201307.\n\n==Hong Kong==\n[[Hong Kong FC (football)|Hong Kong Football Club]] has won many titles in the second-tier competition in Hong Kong Soccer League history, however, they have rarely enjoyed success when playing against the professional sides in top-tier competitions. Therefore, they have the local nickname ''the lift'' (Chinese: \u5347\u964d\u6a5f), which is the equivalent of the term Yo-yo club.\n\n==Ireland==\nIrish club [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]] are known as a yo-yo club due to the regular frequency of the club's relegation and promotion to and from the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] and [[League of Ireland First Division]].

They were promoted to the [[Polish First League]] in 1994 (known as ''Petrochemia P\u0142ock'' at the time), but were relegated after one season. Promoted again in 1997, they again were relegated after one season. Their next promotion came (after shortening their name to ''Petro P\u0142ock'') in 2000, and this time they managed to avoid relegation after one season. However, the next season (known now as ''Orlen P\u0142ock'') they were again relegated. In 2002, reverting to the original name ''Wis\u0142a P\u0142ock'', they were promoted to First League, and finally enjoyed relative stability, even reaching the [[Polish Cup]] final in 2003 and winning it in 2006. However, relegation was again in order in 2007. After that, they spent 3 years in the second tier before being relegated to the third in 2010. They immediately got promoted to the second tier, but got relegated from it again in 2012. They were once again promoted to the second tier the following season, spending 3 years in it, before finally returning to the Ekstraklasa in 2016. In spite of this \"yo-yoing,\" Wis\u0142a have avoided the fate of other relegated clubs in Poland, such as bankruptcy (e.g. [[Szczakowianka Jaworzno]]) or further relegation to lower divisions (e.g. [[Rak\u00f3w Cz\u0119stochowa]]).\n\n==Sweden==\nIn [[Sweden]] the term has been used especially for [[Hammarby IF]]'s men's soccer team but also [[Katrineholms SK Bandy|Katrineholms SK's men's bandy team]] during the early-mid 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/arkiv/sport/boltic-favorit-men-bandyhjartat-bloder-for-soders-broder/|title=Boltic favorit \u2013 men bandyhj\u00e4rtat bl\u00f6der f\u00f6r S\u00f6ders br\u00f6der|publisher=Dagens nyheter|language=Swedish|date=12 November 1995|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Turkey==\n\nIn Turkey, these kinds of clubs are called ''asans\u00f6r tak\u0131m'' (elevator team). [[Kar\u015f\u0131yaka S.K.]] relegated from first level in 1964, 1967, 1972, 1991, 1994 and 1996. Kar\u015f\u0131yaka also played in third level between 1973\u20131980 and 2001\u20132003. Also [[Sakaryaspor]] has an interesting statistic. They promoted in 1981, relegated in 1986. But they promoted again after the 1986\u201387 season. However they could only stay in first level for three seasons and relegated again in 1990. They came back to first level for a single season in 1998\u201399. They were back again in first level in 2004\u201305, but relegated same season. They won the 2005\u201306 play-offs and promoted to first level again, just to relegate after one season. They almost repeated same thing when they reached play-offs in 2007\u201308 but this time they lost and finally \"stayed\" in second level for a second season in row. Sakaryaspor later relegated to once to third level in 2008\u201309 season. Sakaryaspor returned second level after play-offs in the 2010\u201311 season but this return was brief due to money shortage. After two successive relegations between 2011 and 2013, they were placed in fourth level. all in all, [[Samsunspor]] was promoted to first level in 1969, 1976, 1982, 1985, 1991, 1993 and 2011 and relegated from first level in 1975, 1979, 1983, 1990, 1992, 2006 and 2012. Samsunspor currently plays in the [[TFF First League|First League]], which is second tier in the Turkish league system.\n\n[[Adanaspor]] is one of the most yo-yoed teams. They were promoted to first league in 1971, relegated in 1984, promoted again in 1988, relegated again in 1991, promoted in 1998, relegated in 2001 and promoted to first league last in 2002. They suffered from financial difficulties between 2003\u20132006 and were relegated to Third League, which is fourth level of Turkish league system in 2006 after three successive relegations. They also didn't win any match at third level in the 2005\u201306 season.

For several years, this was the only store in the UK to stock the Oreo \u2013 until May 2008, when Kraft decided to fully launch the Oreo across the whole of the UK.

An Oreo flavored \"Krushem\" drink was also on sale in [[KFC]] stores across Britain.\n\nThe ingredients of the British Oreo biscuit (as listed on the UK Oreo website) are slightly different from those of the US Oreo cookie.

An Oreo flavored \"Krushem\" drink was also on sale in [[KFC]] stores across Britain.\n\nThe ingredients of the British Oreo biscuit (as listed on the UK Oreo website) are slightly different from those of the US Oreo cookie.
