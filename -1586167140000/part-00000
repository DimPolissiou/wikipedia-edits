The control of gas migration is normally achieved by blocking the pathway or removing the source of the gas generation. There are several methods available to achieve the protection of existing/new build properties. Another factor to consider, regarding gas protection, is the use of the property and size (economic factors).\n\nThe main components that developers have to be aware of are [[methane]] (which is flammable at 5-15% by volume in air) and [[carbon dioxide]] (which is toxic), especially after two [[gas explosions]] happened in the [[UK]] in the 1980s: [[Loscoe]] and [[Abbeystead]]. [[Building Research Establishment]], [[British Standard]]s, the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of Environment]] and other regulatory bodies including ones in the construction industry have developed and published guidance for preventing such gasses from entering into a building. Their production in the environment is associated with [[coal seams]], deposited [[Silt|river silt]], [[sewage]], [[landfill]], and [[peat]].\n\nIn the case of [[landfill gas migration]], the gas is produced by organic materials in the waste degrading over time. Creating varying concentration over time ({{CO2}} typically 40 percent by volume and methane ({{chem|CH|4}}) typically 60 percent by volume), as previously explained this gas can be heavier than air or lighter depending on the concentrations of these gases and air, but will move from an area of high pressure to one at a lower pressure irrespective of its relative density.\n\nTo try to prevent landfill gas migration from the site, the operator should employ such methods as [[leachate]] drains with venting, low permeability [[geomembranes]], slurry trenches, and grout curtains around the landfill site.\n\n==New buildings on contaminated land==\nThe development of buildings on contaminated land will require a barrier created either vertically in the instance of homes with basements or horizontally under the base of the house. This can be by means of generally a passive barrier but can sometimes be an active system.\n\n===Passive system===\nThis system will utilise a barrier with low permeability either via a synthetic membrane or a natural/engineered clay material.\nThe effectiveness of these barriers are greatly affected by the installation methods and the integrity of the barrier being used. It must installed so it conforms to building regulations and quality assurance standards with guidance from BRE414.\n[[File:Gas Membrane 2.jpg|left|thumb|Installed gas membrane - note corner details]]\n\nThe gas membrane can be put over a suspended beam and block floor and covered with a screed the area below being vented by airbricks or can be laid over a venting layer (200mm of granular material or 25mm of voidformer /a [[geocomposite]])\n\nAny penetration requiring passage thought the barrier will need to be sealed. This system will prevent entry of gases into the property and will be combined with an adequate venting system to allow dispersal of the gases to prevent any buildup around or under the property.\n\nNote in the photo two types of [[heat gun]] that weld the material together or else material can be connected by using double-sided butyl tape. The layer also extends over the exterior brick work.\n\nPassive systems should have an integrity test to ensure the safety of the work. A test gas mixed with air is released under the membrane via a special tool. The entire area is then checked by operators using special air sensors to see if there are any leaks.  If the work passes then it should be issued with a certificate of integrity.\n\n===Active systems===\nDue to the cost implications and the requirement for management and control this type of protection is mainly used on commercial properties.\n\nThere are two main practical types of Active systems to prevent the ingress of gases into buildings:\n* Positive pressurisation:  this system uses a small low power fan or pump (PPU - Positive pressurisation unit) to maintain a positive pressure under the building to act as a barrier to gases that are rising through the soil.   This also will not draw gas towards it by the [[venturi effect]].\n* Forced ventilation under the building: again a small fan or pump is used to force air through a void  under the building.    This method can be run constantly or set to be activated by a gas sensor when the concentration reaches a certain level. The latter being the main application where this system has been used.\n\nThere should be alarms for both systems in the event of power failure to the systems as this will lead to an eventual buildup of gases to a dangerous level. These systems should be assessed by a third party to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the system.\n\n==Building near landfill sites==\nThe issue with developing housing around such site is compounded by such issues as the [[stack effect]], that is  warm indoor air being less dense than the exterior cold air and so creating an area of lower pressure inside a property, which will encourage the ingress of gas.  This gas can concentrate in any subfloor void (i.e. basements or gaps created below the floor slab due to settlement) or even in cupboards.  It can also enter the building in any gaps left in the construction of the property or created during settlement.\n\n\"Waste management Paper 27\" from the UK Department of the Environment recommends consultation with the relevant local authority if any proposed development is to be less than 250m from the site boundary that has received waste in the last 30 years.\n\nThe 250m is not a definitive insomuch as landfill gas will not be present outside or conversely present within this distance, due to the varied factors contributing to [[landfill gas migration]]. Due to this fact there should always be a thorough [[site investigation]] if a development is taking place within the 250 m zone or if there is a suspicion of any hazardous gas being present.\n\n==Construction principles==\n{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}\n\n==Integrity testing==\nBoth systems should have/require 'Gas integrity testing'.\n\nThe [[NHBC]] traffic light system (a method of gauging require protection need from results form the site investigation\u2014the higher the risk the more points required in terms of protection to allow domestic construction) will offer a score of 2 points for a foil backed gas membrane installed with integrity testing where an untested gas membrane might result in 0.5 points.\n\nThis is both due to the conditions under which gas membranes are installed are often difficult and can adversely compromise the integrity required by the manufacturer/client. The purpose of the test to ensure this integrity to allow the installation to be certified as the method of protection performs correctly.\n\n===Gas membrane testing===\nThe test is carried out on the membrane immediately after its installation and prior to it being covered up by the following construction processes. The area below the membrane is temporarily pressurised with a mixture of clean air and a specialist nontoxic and inert [[tracer gas]] that is extremely sensitive to detection. Specialist equipment is then used to trace all leaks within the installation with particular attention being paid to the critical points and junctions formed between the membrane material and other structural elements prior to conducting a detailed sweep of the complete area (see construction principles). Any leaks are identified, sealed and re-tested before the membrane is passed and then the Certificate can be issued.\n\n===Active systems===\nRequire a test of the alarm in case of failure of the system/power supply and possible dangerous buildup of gas.\n\n==References==\n* CIRIA 665.\n* CIRIA 735\n* BS8485.\n* Department of the Environment, The control of landfill gas, Waste management paper No 27.\n* Department of Environment, Landfill sites development control.\n* Guidance on evaluation of development proposals on sites where Methane and Carbon dioxide are present, incorporating Traffic Lights.

The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\". The video concludes with Drake in total darkness, \"only his white sneakers visible against the eerily black [[Toronto]] sky\".

Prior to the introduction of Western Sydney Wanderers in the A-League, the only club to be based in the city was Sydney FC as part of [[Football Federation Australia|FFA]]'s 'one-city, one-team' policy for the newly established league. This deal gave Sydney FC a five-year city exclusivity, allowing the club grow throughout the region without competition. Sydney FC was not entirely embraced by the region, as the club's original intention to play at [[Parramatta Stadium]] was later changed by FFA chairman [[Frank Lowy]].<ref name=\"smh.com.au\">{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Soccer/NSW-cut-ties-with-new-club-over-Lowy/2004/12/11/1102625585718.html |title=NSW 'cut ties' with new club over Lowy |work=smh.com.au|accessdate=20 April 2013 |date=12 December 2004}}</ref> Lowy's decision for the club to play out of the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] left some fans in Sydney's west feeling alienated from the club.<ref>{{cite web|title=The underdog bites \u2013 the Western Sydney Wanderers story|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/53779|publisher=greenleft.org.au|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref> Sydney FC's perceived exclusion of the western region mirrored the pre-existing cultural and social divide of the city.\n\nIn 2008, FFA sought to introduce the new western Sydney-based [[Sydney Rovers FC|Sydney Rovers]] into the A-League.

During the time period prior to the disbanding of Sydney Rovers, two matches hosted by Sydney FC were played at Parramatta Stadium.

With Del Piero on the bench due to an injury cloud, the Wanderers began the stronger, and [[Youssouf Hersi]] scored the first ever Wanderers goal in a Sydney Derby, after latching onto a knock-down from [[Joey Gibbs]].

[[Brendon Santalab]] scored the only goal of the match in the 86th minute.

[[Ali Abbas Al-Hilfi|Ali Abbas]] scored a penalty during injury time to make the score 3\u20131. The game also featured an allegation that Wanderers player [[Brendon Santalab]] culturally abused Abbas, who took extreme offence and charged around the pitch, having to be restrained by his teammates.

Despite Sydney FC having much of the early possession, the first goal was scored by former Sydney FC player [[Mark Bridge]] in the 19th minute. 5 minutes later Sydney FC keeper Janjetovic attempted to clear the ball but instead he somehow palmed the ball into his own net and sent the wanderers 2\u20130 up. Seconds before halftime [[Corey Gameiro]] scored a goal for Sydney FC to get the score back to 2\u20131.

With the score level at 2\u20132 tempers between the two side began to flare. Wanderer [[Vitor Saba]] was red carded after a dangerous tackle on [[Terry Antonis]]. Now down to ten men, the Wanderers fell behind when Sydney FC captain [[Alex Brosque]] scored with just over ten minutes remaining, with what would prove to be the winning goal. A [[pitch invasion]] ensued as over a hundred Sydney FC fans ran from The Cove onto the field to celebrate with Brosque, a scene which sportswriter Phil Rothfield described as being \"as special as it gets.\"<ref name=\"Derby 7 Pitch Invasion\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/football/monday-buzz-western-sydney-wanderers-v-sydney-fc-is-now-the-biggest-game-in-town/story-fnp0lxay-1227095360624 |title=Western Sydney Wanderers v Sydney FC is now the biggest game in town  |work=dailytelegraph.com.au |accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe eighth Sydney derby was played on 29 November 2014, in the 2014\u201315 A-League Season and took place in front of a packed crowd of 19,138 at Pirtek Stadium in Paramatta. The Wanderers started the stronger of the two sides, with both fan groups in full voice. Western Sydney Wanderers had many chances during the first half but only managed to capitalize on one. Tomi Juric pounced onto a loose ball on the box, sidefooting into the bottom left corner. Only 4 minutes later, Sydney FC equalised. The corner came in from a Wanderers player, bounced into the box, some appealing for a handball off Pedj Bojic but appeals were waved away, Bojic cleared the ball and Bernie Ibini chased the ball down, beating a defender to it from his own half. Ibini comfortably picked the ball up and went on a penetrating run, beating two Western Sydney defenders and smashing the ball past Ante Covic, the Western Sydney goalkeeper. In stoppage time at the end of the first half, a superb through pall was played to Mark Bridge who failed to score, forcing a brilliant save from Vedran Janjetovic. Towards the latter end of the second half, Sydney FC had a  couple of chances. Shane Smeltz connected well with the ball and produced a volley which was tipped over by Ante Covic. In the final minute of the game, a free kick was awarded to Sydney FC, Marc Janko struck the ball beautifully, only to have it crash off the crossbar. The game ended 1\u20131, the second ever draw in the history of the fixture.\n\nThe thirteenth Sydney Derby, played on 8 October 2016 was a milestone match for the fixture. It set a new A-League crowd record of 61,880 at [[ANZ Stadium]], as the Sky Blues triumphed in an emphatic second half, finishing 4-0. The opening goal scored by [[Filip Holosko]], was quickly followed by a second, with Holosko assisting debutante [[Bob\u00f4 (footballer born 1985)|Bob\u00f4]] to a tap-in. It remained a gutsy game with a plethora of saves from [[Danny Vukovic]] of Sydney FC to keep it at 2\u20130 until a breakaway from Sydney FC captain Alex Brosque led to a free-kick on the edge of the box, with [[Aritz Borda]] being sent off. [[Brandon O'Neill]] took the free-kick, flying it past the wall and keeper to make it three nil. Adding salt into the wounds, [[Matt Simon]] sprinted free of Dimas on a counterattack, with a cross to Bob\u00f4 resulting in a parried shot, before [[Alex Brosque]] scored the fourth as it was dubbed the \"Demolition Derby\".<ref>https://www.a-league.com.au/news/sydney-fcs-epic-second-half-blows-away-wanderers-0</ref>\n\nThe fifteenth Sydney derby was played on 18 February 2017 at [[Stadium Australia]]. In front of a crowd of 44,843 the Wanderers ended Sydney FC's 19 game-winning run, and achieved their first derby victory in 1135 days, with a hard-fought 1\u20130 win, courtesy of a first half [[Brendon Santalab]] goal. The Wanderers' win denied Sydney FC the opportunity to become the first A-League team to finish a season undefeated. The loss was Sydney's only loss of the season, as they went on to win the Premiership and Championship with a W-D-L record of 22\u20136\u20131.\n\nThe seventeenth Sydney Derby, similarly to the thirteenth derby, was dubbed the Demolition Derby as Sydney FC thumped the Western Sydney outfit 5\u20130. The first goal of the game came from Polish international [[Adrian Mierzejewski]], who slammed home a poor parry from Vedran Janjetovic. Sydney captain [[Alex Brosque]] doubled their lead, latching onto a through ball from [[Bob\u00f4 (footballer, born 1985)|Bob\u00f4]] before rounding Janjetovic for a simple tap-in. On 45 minutes, Mierzejewski scored his second of the game, and Sydney's third, with a free kick from distance which the keeper could only get a hand to as it smashed into the back of the net. After half time, a corner taken by Mierzejewski was deflected in by Western Sydney striker [[Lachlan Scott]] for 4\u20130. On 77 minutes, the rout was completed as Brandon O'Neill placed a curling shot in the top corner for 5\u20130.<ref>https://www.sydneyfc.com/match/western-sydney-wanderers-fc-v-sydney-fc-a-league-09-12-2017/927990</ref>\n\nOn 6 October 2018, the two sides met for the first time in an FFA Cup, which saw Sydney FC defeat the Wanderers 3-0 in a semi final hosted by the Wanderers at Penrith Stadium.\n\nThe twenty third Sydney Derby was the first derby played at the [[Western Sydney Stadium|Wanderers' new stadium]]. The Wanderers achieved their first Sydney Derby win in any competition in 980 days, winning 1-0 through a [[Mitchell Duke]] goal in the 19th minute. The twenty fourth derby was originally scheduled for Saturday 8 February 2020, but a deluge of rain in Sydney over the days prior to, and on the day itself, saw the match postponed. This would become the first ever derby to be played at [[Jubilee Oval]], making it the seventh stadium to host the rivalry. The Wanderers went on to win the postponed match, again 1\u20130 with Duke scoring the decisive goal. This marked the first time they had won back to back derbies since the 2013\u201314 A-League season. On Saturday 21 March 2020, the match was played behind closed doors due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.a-league.com.au/news/update-covid-19-impact-football|title=Update on COVID-19: Hyundai A-League to play matches behind closed doors|date=2020-03-16|website=Hyundai A-League|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> The match ended as a 1\u20131 draw, marking the first time Sydney FC hadn't won a derby in a season.\n\n===A-League Regular Season/FFA Cup===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:0 left; font-size: 11px; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Prior to the introduction of Western Sydney Wanderers in the A-League, the only club to be based in the city was Sydney FC as part of [[Football Federation Australia|FFA]]'s 'one-city, one-team' policy for the newly established league. This deal gave Sydney FC a five-year city exclusivity, allowing the club grow throughout the region without competition. Sydney FC was not entirely embraced by the region, as the club's original intention to play at [[Parramatta Stadium]] was later changed by FFA chairman [[Frank Lowy]].<ref name=\"smh.com.au\">{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Soccer/NSW-cut-ties-with-new-club-over-Lowy/2004/12/11/1102625585718.html |title=NSW 'cut ties' with new club over Lowy |work=smh.com.au|accessdate=20 April 2013 |date=12 December 2004}}</ref> Lowy's decision for the club to play out of the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] left some fans in Sydney's west feeling alienated from the club.<ref>{{cite web|title=The underdog bites \u2013 the Western Sydney Wanderers story|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/53779|publisher=greenleft.org.au|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref> Sydney FC's perceived exclusion of the western region mirrored the pre-existing cultural and social divide of the city.\n\nIn 2008, FFA sought to introduce the new western Sydney-based [[Sydney Rovers FC|Sydney Rovers]] into the A-League. This later proved unsuccessful with the club dissolving due to technical and financial reasons. During the time period prior to the disbanding of Sydney Rovers, two matches hosted by Sydney FC were played at Parramatta Stadium.

With Del Piero on the bench due to an injury cloud, the Wanderers began the stronger, and [[Youssouf Hersi]] scored the first ever Wanderers goal in a Sydney Derby, after latching onto a knock-down from [[Joey Gibbs]].

Despite Sydney FC having much of the early possession, the first goal was scored by former Sydney FC player [[Mark Bridge]] in the 19th minute. 5 minutes later Sydney FC keeper Janjetovic attempted to clear the ball but instead he somehow palmed the ball into his own net and sent the wanderers 2\u20130 up.

After half time Sydney FC created several chances however their second goal came from an own goal scored by Wanderers midfielder [[Romeo Castelen]]. With the score level at 2\u20132 tempers between the two side began to flare. Wanderer [[Vitor Saba]] was red carded after a dangerous tackle on [[Terry Antonis]]. Now down to ten men, the Wanderers fell behind when Sydney FC captain [[Alex Brosque]] scored with just over ten minutes remaining, with what would prove to be the winning goal. A [[pitch invasion]] ensued as over a hundred Sydney FC fans ran from The Cove onto the field to celebrate with Brosque, a scene which sportswriter Phil Rothfield described as being \"as special as it gets.\"<ref name=\"Derby 7 Pitch Invasion\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/football/monday-buzz-western-sydney-wanderers-v-sydney-fc-is-now-the-biggest-game-in-town/story-fnp0lxay-1227095360624 |title=Western Sydney Wanderers v Sydney FC is now the biggest game in town  |work=dailytelegraph.com.au |accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe eighth Sydney derby was played on 29 November 2014, in the 2014\u201315 A-League Season and took place in front of a packed crowd of 19,138 at Pirtek Stadium in Paramatta. The Wanderers started the stronger of the two sides, with both fan groups in full voice. Western Sydney Wanderers had many chances during the first half but only managed to capitalize on one. Tomi Juric pounced onto a loose ball on the box, sidefooting into the bottom left corner. Only 4 minutes later, Sydney FC equalised. The corner came in from a Wanderers player, bounced into the box, some appealing for a handball off Pedj Bojic but appeals were waved away, Bojic cleared the ball and Bernie Ibini chased the ball down, beating a defender to it from his own half. Ibini comfortably picked the ball up and went on a penetrating run, beating two Western Sydney defenders and smashing the ball past Ante Covic, the Western Sydney goalkeeper. In stoppage time at the end of the first half, a superb through pall was played to Mark Bridge who failed to score, forcing a brilliant save from Vedran Janjetovic. Towards the latter end of the second half, Sydney FC had a  couple of chances. Shane Smeltz connected well with the ball and produced a volley which was tipped over by Ante Covic. In the final minute of the game, a free kick was awarded to Sydney FC, Marc Janko struck the ball beautifully, only to have it crash off the crossbar. The game ended 1\u20131, the second ever draw in the history of the fixture.\n\nThe thirteenth Sydney Derby, played on 8 October 2016 was a milestone match for the fixture. It set a new A-League crowd record of 61,880 at [[ANZ Stadium]], as the Sky Blues triumphed in an emphatic second half, finishing 4-0. The opening goal scored by [[Filip Holosko]], was quickly followed by a second, with Holosko assisting debutante [[Bob\u00f4 (footballer born 1985)|Bob\u00f4]] to a tap-in. It remained a gutsy game with a plethora of saves from [[Danny Vukovic]] of Sydney FC to keep it at 2\u20130 until a breakaway from Sydney FC captain Alex Brosque led to a free-kick on the edge of the box, with [[Aritz Borda]] being sent off. [[Brandon O'Neill]] took the free-kick, flying it past the wall and keeper to make it three nil. Adding salt into the wounds, [[Matt Simon]] sprinted free of Dimas on a counterattack, with a cross to Bob\u00f4 resulting in a parried shot, before [[Alex Brosque]] scored the fourth as it was dubbed the \"Demolition Derby\".<ref>https://www.a-league.com.au/news/sydney-fcs-epic-second-half-blows-away-wanderers-0</ref>\n\nThe fifteenth Sydney derby was played on 18 February 2017 at [[Stadium Australia]]. In front of a crowd of 44,843 the Wanderers ended Sydney FC's 19 game-winning run, and achieved their first derby victory in 1135 days, with a hard-fought 1\u20130 win, courtesy of a first half [[Brendon Santalab]] goal. The Wanderers' win denied Sydney FC the opportunity to become the first A-League team to finish a season undefeated. The loss was Sydney's only loss of the season, as they went on to win the Premiership and Championship with a W-D-L record of 22\u20136\u20131.\n\nThe seventeenth Sydney Derby, similarly to the thirteenth derby, was dubbed the Demolition Derby as Sydney FC thumped the Western Sydney outfit 5\u20130. The first goal of the game came from Polish international [[Adrian Mierzejewski]], who slammed home a poor parry from Vedran Janjetovic. Sydney captain [[Alex Brosque]] doubled their lead, latching onto a through ball from [[Bob\u00f4 (footballer, born 1985)|Bob\u00f4]] before rounding Janjetovic for a simple tap-in. On 45 minutes, Mierzejewski scored his second of the game, and Sydney's third, with a free kick from distance which the keeper could only get a hand to as it smashed into the back of the net. After half time, a corner taken by Mierzejewski was deflected in by Western Sydney striker [[Lachlan Scott]] for 4\u20130. On 77 minutes, the rout was completed as Brandon O'Neill placed a curling shot in the top corner for 5\u20130.<ref>https://www.sydneyfc.com/match/western-sydney-wanderers-fc-v-sydney-fc-a-league-09-12-2017/927990</ref>\n\nOn 6 October 2018, the two sides met for the first time in an FFA Cup, which saw Sydney FC defeat the Wanderers 3-0 in a semi final hosted by the Wanderers at Penrith Stadium.\n\nThe twenty third Sydney Derby was the first derby played at the [[Western Sydney Stadium|Wanderers' new stadium]]. The Wanderers achieved their first Sydney Derby win in any competition in 980 days, winning 1-0 through a [[Mitchell Duke]] goal in the 19th minute. The twenty fourth derby was originally scheduled for Saturday 8 February 2020, but a deluge of rain in Sydney over the days prior to, and on the day itself, saw the match postponed.\n\n===A-League Regular Season/FFA Cup===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:0 left; font-size: 11px; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The Australian brushturkey has also been introduced to [[Kangaroo Island]] in South Australia. It is the largest extant representative of the family Megapodiidae, and is one of three species to inhabit Australia.\n\nDespite its name and their superficial similarities, the bird is not closely related to [[Meleagris|American turkeys]], nor to the [[Australian bustard]], which is also known as the bush turkey. Its closest relatives are the [[wattled brushturkey]], [[Waigeo brushturkey]], and [[malleefowl]].\n\n==Biology==\n[[File:Australian Brush-turkey.webm|thumb|left|Australian brushturkey in a suburban backyard, Sydney, Australia]]\nIt is a large bird with black feathers and a red head. Its total length is about {{convert|60|\u2013|75|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} and a wingspan of about {{convert|85|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The subspecies ''A. l. purpureicollis'' from the northern [[Cape York Peninsula]] is smaller than the more widespread [[nominate subspecies]]. It has a prominent, fan-like tail flattened sideways, and its [[plumage]] is mainly blackish, but with a bare red head, and a yellow (in the nominate subspecies) or purple [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattle]] (in ''A. l. purpureicollis''). The males' wattles become much larger during breeding season, often swinging from side to side as they run. The males' heads and wattles also become much brighter during the breeding and [[nesting season]]. The underside of the body is sprinkled with white feathers, more pronounced in older birds. The brushturkey is a clumsy flyer and cannot fly long distances, only taking to the air when threatened by predators or to roost in trees at night and during the heat of the day.\n\nThey build large nests on the ground made of leaves, other compostable material, and earth, {{convert|1|to|1.5|m|ft}} high and up to {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} across. Mound-building is done by a dominant male, and visited by a succession of local females, for mating and egg-laying. The male works tirelessly, collecting material from all around, and also diligently repelling rival males, which are keen to usurp his position. The effort involved eventually wears him down, and he will ultimately be defeated by a new king. The eggs are very large (90 \u00d7 45&nbsp;mm), and the young are fully fledged on hatching. They can fly within hours, as soon as the feathers are dry. The eggs are hatched by the heat of the composting mound, the temperature of which is regulated by adding or removing material to maintain the temperature in the {{convert|33|\u2013|35|C|F}} incubation temperature range.<ref>New South Wales Government Department of Environment and Climate Change website: [http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/plantsanimals/AustralianBrushTurkey.htm ''Australian Brushturkey'']</ref> The Australian brushturkey checks the temperature by sticking its beak into the mound. Like some [[reptiles]], incubation temperature affects the sex ratio of chicks, but the mechanism is different between reptiles and these birds, with reptiles exhibiting temperature-dependent sex determination, and megapodes exhibiting temperature-dependent embryo mortality. The sex ratio in brushturkeys is equal at incubation temperatures of 34\u00b0C, but results in more males when cooler and more females when warmer ([[statistical significance|p]]=0.035). Whether the parents use this to manipulate the sex of their offspring by, for instance, selecting the nesting site accordingly, is unclear. Warmer incubation also results in heavier, fitter chicks (p<0.0001), but how this is linked to gender is also unknown.<ref>{{cite journal|last=G\u00f6th|first=Ann|author2=Booth, David T|title=Temperature-dependent sex ratio in a bird|journal=Biology Letters|date=22 March 2005|volume=1|pages=31\u201333|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0247|pmid=17148121|pmc=1629050}}</ref>\n[[File:Alectura lathami MHNT 226 Australie.jpg|thumb|Egg of ''Alectura lathami'' [[MHNT]]]]\nThe same nesting site is frequently used year after year, with the old nests being added to each breeding season. The average clutch of eggs is between 16 and 24 large white eggs, which are laid September to March. Sometimes, up to 50 eggs laid by several females may be found in a single mound. The eggs are placed in a circle roughly {{convert|60|\u2013|80|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} down, {{convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} apart, always with the large end up. The newly hatched young dig themselves out of the mound and then have to care for themselves.\n\nBrushturkey eggs are a favourite food of [[goanna]]s, snakes, and [[dingo]]es and dogs, though brushturkeys were also a staple of [[Aboriginal Australians]]. Often, goannas exhibit wounds on their tails from having been pecked by brushturkeys that ferociously chase them away from their nests.\n\nIn situations where they come into contact with humans, such as picnic areas in national parks and suburban gardens, brushturkeys exhibit little fear and often boldly attempt to steal food from tables and raid compost bins. They nest in suburban gardens, and in search of material for their nests remove enormous amounts of [[mulch]] from gardens.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Australian Brush Turkey Nest (Sydney).jpg|thumb|right|Leaf litter nesting site of an Australian brushturkey in northern Sydney.]]\nThe Australian brushturkey inhabits [[rainforest]]s and wet [[sclerophyll]] forests, but can also be found in drier scrubs and open areas. In the northern part of its range, the Australian brushturkey is most common at higher altitudes, but individuals move to the lowland areas in winter. In the south, it is common in both mountain and lowland regions.\n\nBrushturkeys are now common in urban environments and can be found in backyards in both [[Brisbane]] and [[Sydney]].<ref name=TurkHab>{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Living with Brush Turkeys|publisher=New South Wales Government|date=27 April 2009|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/media/DecMedia09042702.htm|accessdate=10 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408131023/http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/media/DecMedia09042702.htm | archivedate=8 April 2013}}</ref><ref>Taylor, John [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-26/scientist-cant-explain-brisbane-brush-turkey-explosion/5987606 Brisbane's brush turkey explosion heads south December 29, 2014] ''[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'' Retrieved June 1, 2016</ref>\n\n==Population==\nBrushturkeys are fairly common presently, but in the 1930s, the bird was supposed to be approaching extinction.<ref name=\"Sydney Mail 1930\">{{cite news|title=Outdoor Australia|newspaper=The Sydney Mail|date=8 January 1930|page=19}}</ref>\n\n==Feeding==\nBrushturkeys feed upon [[insects]], seeds, and fallen fruits, which are exposed by raking the leaf litter or breaking open rotten logs with their large feet.

They can fly within hours, as soon as the feathers are dry. The eggs are hatched by the heat of the composting mound, the temperature of which is regulated by adding or removing material to maintain the temperature in the {{convert|33|\u2013|35|C|F}} incubation temperature range.<ref>New South Wales Government Department of Environment and Climate Change website: [http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/plantsanimals/AustralianBrushTurkey.htm ''Australian Brushturkey'']</ref> The Australian brushturkey checks the temperature by sticking its beak into the mound. Like some [[reptiles]], incubation temperature affects the sex ratio of chicks, but the mechanism is different between reptiles and these birds, with reptiles exhibiting temperature-dependent sex determination, and megapodes exhibiting temperature-dependent embryo mortality. The sex ratio in brushturkeys is equal at incubation temperatures of 34\u00b0C, but results in more males when cooler and more females when warmer ([[statistical significance|p]]=0.035). Whether the parents use this to manipulate the sex of their offspring by, for instance, selecting the nesting site accordingly, is unclear. Warmer incubation also results in heavier, fitter chicks (p<0.0001), but how this is linked to gender is also unknown.<ref>{{cite journal|last=G\u00f6th|first=Ann|author2=Booth, David T|title=Temperature-dependent sex ratio in a bird|journal=Biology Letters|date=22 March 2005|volume=1|pages=31\u201333|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0247|pmid=17148121|pmc=1629050}}</ref>\n[[File:Alectura lathami MHNT 226 Australie.jpg|thumb|Egg of ''Alectura lathami'' [[MHNT]]]]\nThe same nesting site is frequently used year after year, with the old nests being added to each breeding season. The average clutch of eggs is between 16 and 24 large white eggs, which are laid September to March. Sometimes, up to 50 eggs laid by several females may be found in a single mound. The eggs are placed in a circle roughly {{convert|60|\u2013|80|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} down, {{convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} apart, always with the large end up. The newly hatched young dig themselves out of the mound and then have to care for themselves.\n\nBrushturkey eggs are a favourite food of [[goanna]]s, snakes, and [[dingo]]es and dogs, though brushturkeys were also a staple of [[Aboriginal Australians]]. Often, goannas exhibit wounds on their tails from having been pecked by brushturkeys that ferociously chase them away from their nests.\n\nIn situations where they come into contact with humans, such as picnic areas in national parks and suburban gardens, brushturkeys exhibit little fear and often boldly attempt to steal food from tables and raid compost bins. They nest in suburban gardens, and in search of material for their nests remove enormous amounts of [[mulch]] from gardens.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Australian Brush Turkey Nest (Sydney).jpg|thumb|right|Leaf litter nesting site of an Australian brushturkey in northern Sydney.]]\nThe Australian brushturkey inhabits [[rainforest]]s and wet [[sclerophyll]] forests, but can also be found in drier scrubs and open areas. In the northern part of its range, the Australian brushturkey is most common at higher altitudes, but individuals move to the lowland areas in winter. In the south, it is common in both mountain and lowland regions.\n\nBrushturkeys are now common in urban environments and can be found in backyards in both [[Brisbane]] and [[Sydney]].<ref name=TurkHab>{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Living with Brush Turkeys|publisher=New South Wales Government|date=27 April 2009|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/media/DecMedia09042702.htm|accessdate=10 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408131023/http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/media/DecMedia09042702.htm | archivedate=8 April 2013}}</ref><ref>Taylor, John [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-26/scientist-cant-explain-brisbane-brush-turkey-explosion/5987606 Brisbane's brush turkey explosion heads south December 29, 2014] ''[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'' Retrieved June 1, 2016</ref>\n\n==Population==\nBrushturkeys are fairly common presently, but in the 1930s, the bird was supposed to be approaching extinction.<ref name=\"Sydney Mail 1930\">{{cite news|title=Outdoor Australia|newspaper=The Sydney Mail|date=8 January 1930|page=19}}</ref>\n\n==Feeding==\nBrushturkeys feed upon [[insects]], seeds, and fallen fruits, which are exposed by raking the leaf litter or breaking open rotten logs with their large feet.

It is located approximately 1,950&nbsp;km south of [[Hanoi]], 189&nbsp;km from [[Ho Chi Minh City]], and 45&nbsp;km from the [[Cambodia]]n border. The population of Long Xuy\u00ean city is over 368,376 (2013), with an area of only 106.87&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n\nLong Xuy\u00ean is the second most prosperous city in [[Mekong Delta|south-western Vietnam]], just after [[C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1]] city.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nThe city is subdivided to 13 [[Commune-level subdivisions (Vietnam)|commune-level subdivisions]], including the [[Ward (Vietnam)|wards]] of: [[M\u1ef9 B\u00ecnh, An Giang|M\u1ef9 B\u00ecnh]], [[M\u1ef9 Long, An Giang|M\u1ef9 Long]], [[M\u1ef9 Xuy\u00ean, An Giang|M\u1ef9 Xuy\u00ean]], [[B\u00ecnh Kh\u00e1nh, An Giang|B\u00ecnh Kh\u00e1nh]], [[M\u1ef9 Ph\u01b0\u1edbc, An Giang|M\u1ef9 Ph\u01b0\u1edbc]], [[\u0110\u00f4ng Xuy\u00ean, An Giang|\u0110\u00f4ng Xuy\u00ean]], [[M\u1ef9 Qu\u00fd, An Giang|M\u1ef9 Qu\u00fd]], [[M\u1ef9 Th\u1ea1nh, An Giang|M\u1ef9 Th\u1ea1nh]], [[M\u1ef9 Th\u1edbi]], [[B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ee9c, An Giang|B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ee9c]], [[M\u1ef9 H\u00f2a, An Giang|M\u1ef9 H\u00f2a]] and the [[Commune (Vietnam)|rural communes]] of [[M\u1ef9 H\u00f2a H\u01b0ng]] and [[M\u1ef9 Kh\u00e1nh, An Giang|M\u1ef9 Kh\u00e1nh]].\n\n==Economy==\nLong Xuy\u00ean is a very developed city in merchandising (mainly in [[rice]] trading) and processing fish industry (such as [[basa fish]]) with more than six plants and 10,000&nbsp;workers.\n\n==Education==\nLong Xuy\u00ean is home to [[An Giang University]] and the Long Xuy\u00ean Teacher's Training College. [[An Giang University]] is the second largest university in the [[Mekong Delta]]. An Giang University has more than 8,000&nbsp;students and began as a teaching trainer's college.  It was given university status in 2000.  Currently they have faculties in Education, Agriculture, Economics, IT, and Marx-Lenin Ideologies.\n\nThere are three main high schools in Long Xuy\u00ean city: [[Tho\u1ea1i Ng\u1ecdc H\u1ea7u]], B\u00ecnh Kh\u00e1nh and Long Xuy\u00ean. Tho\u1ea1i Ng\u1ecdc H\u1ea7u high school was once known as Long Xuy\u00ean high school, with currently over 2,000&nbsp;students. Tho\u1ea1i Ng\u1ecdc H\u1ea7u is a specialized school for majors of English, Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, Literature, and Biology.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:C\u1ea7u Ho\u00e0ng Di\u1ec7u.jpg|300px|thumb|Ho\u00e0ng Di\u1ec7u Bridge]]\nLong Xuy\u00ean is the center of the [[H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o]] religion. There are also many Catholic churches, as well as some people who follow [[Buddhism]] and other religions. Each March, Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c celebrates the B\u00e0 Ch\u00faa X\u1ee9 festival, a large religious festival on top of Sam mountain.\n\nAlso, former president [[T\u00f4n \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1eafng]]'s birthday is celebrated in M\u1ef9 H\u00f2a H\u01b0ng (Tiger Island).\n\nLocal dishes include the standard Vietnamese fare as well as some variations on the area specialties (for example [[basa fish]], m\u1eafm th\u00e1i, and thot not coconuts).\n\nEach year, many tourists pass through Long Xuy\u00ean on their way to [[Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c]], which is a major stop-over on the way to Cambodia. However, tourists rarely stay in Long Xuy\u00ean. [[B\u00e0 Ch\u00faa X\u1ee9]] Shrine is a sacred place that is visited by many people who pray for financial success. \n\n==Notable residents==\n*[[Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Th\u01a1]], vice-president of
