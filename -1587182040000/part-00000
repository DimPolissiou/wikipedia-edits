The fort was built on a rocky point of land near the mouth of the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] on [[Long Island Sound]]; it was completed in 1777 and named for Governor Trumbull, who served from 1769 to 1784. It was attacked in 1781 during the [[American Revolutionary War]], and was captured by British forces under the command of [[Benedict Arnold]].<ref name = cmh>{{cite web| url =http://www.history.army.mil/html/artphoto/pripos/eastman.html| title = Fort Trumbull, Connecticut (1775)| accessdate = June 16, 2010| publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]| date = March 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Arnold's raid===\n[[Benedict Arnold]] had changed his allegiances by this time, and he was serving as a brigadier general in the British Army when he led a raid on Groton and New London, Connecticut on September 6, 1781.  Two bodies of troops were landed on either side of the mouth of the Thames River and marched towards Fort Trumbull in New London and [[Fort Griswold]] in Groton.\n\nFort Trumbull fell after little resistance, but about 150 Connecticut militiamen made a gallant stand at Fort Griswold in the [[Battle of Groton Heights]].  The British were finally able to enter the fort, and militia commander Lieutenant Colonel [[William Ledyard]] offered his sword to Major Bromfield, the British commander on the scene, as a token of surrender.  According to contemporaneous accounts, Bromfield took the sword from Ledyard and drove it through him, and the British then proceeded to massacre the surviving defenders.   Eighty-five of the militiamen were killed and the others were either severely wounded, taken prisoner, or managed to escape.\n\nAfter the capture of both forts, the British proceeded to burn New London and then returned to their ships.\n\nAn account of the battle published in a Philadelphia newspaper follows:\n\n<blockquote>- Extract of a letter from New London, dated Sept. 12. </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> ''Arnold had long promised to visit New London and the neighbouring towns on the sea shore, and the enemy having frequently appeared in sight of the harbour, the alarm guns fired on the present occasion were considered by the country around us the salutes of prizes or other vessels belonging to the port. He however arrived the 6th inst. about five o, and at seven o\u2019 landed about 2500 men, half on each side of the river. At 8 o\u2019 the militia mustered in parties of 8 or 10, and annoyed the enemy until about 100 of them came up and disputed their way to Fort Trumbull; their great superiority obliged our people to yield to them the possession of the fort. Col. Ledyard, with about 76 other brave fellows, retreated to the fort on Groton side, which they determined resolutely to defend. The next assault was upon this fort, where they were repulsed several times by a bravery unequalled, for about three hours. A flag was then sent, demanding a surrender of the fort, accompanies by a threat of giving no quarters in case of refusal. The commandant consulted with his brave garrison, who refused to submit. The action was then renewed, when the flag staff was unfortunately shot away; notwithstanding which the defence was gallantly continued until about five or six hundred of the enemy having forced the pickets had entered through the breach. At this time there were but four of the garrison killed, and it was thought prudent to submit, to preserve the lives of the remainder. The officer who at this time commanded the assailants, (Major Montgomery being killed) enquired who commanded the garrison? Colonel Ledyard informed him that he had had that honour, but was unfortunate in being obliged to surrender it, at the same time delivered up to him his sword, and asked for quarter for himself and people; to which the infamous villain replied, \"ye rascals, I give you quarters,\" and then plunged the sword into his body. The inhuman banditti, taking this as a signal, drove their bayonets up to the muzzles of their pieces into the breasts of all that were taken, except one or two who made their escape.'' </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> ''After massacring the living they insulted the dead, by actions too horrid to mention --- the bodies were arranged alongside of each other for the purpose, and, to shew contempt to Col. Ledyard, they singled out a Negroe to place next to him.''  </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''Never was there more distress in any place than there is here at present; there are 50 widows within 8 miles of Groton fort''. </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> ''Before their departure, which was in the evening of the same day they landed, they burnt all the shipping that could not get up Norwich river, among which were several rich prizes lately arrived, with their cargoes, some of which were stored and the rest on board the vessels \u2013 about 40 sail, all on fire, were floating up and down the stream. The prize brig Hope, laden with provisions, happily escaped the general conflagration, altho'the fire from the shore several times caught the awning which covered her quarter deck, and went out --- several vessels in full blaze passed within two and three feet of her; ten lay within forty yards, and consumed to the wateredge, but Providence directed she should escape, and a very fortunate one it was, as there was no other supply of provisions in town.'' \u2013 '''The Pennsylvania Gazette''', September 26, 1781</blockquote>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Fort Trumbull.jpg|thumb|300px|Fort Trumbull<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lossing |first=Benson |title=The Pictorial Field-Book of the War of 1812 |publisher=Harper & Brothers, Publishers |year=1868 |page=697}}</ref>]]\nThe fort was repaired circa 1808, and redesigned and rebuilt in 1812 to meet changing military needs under the [[seacoast defense in the United States|second system of US fortifications]]. First a [[redoubt]] was built at the site to react to threat of British attack. [[Secretary of War]] [[Henry Dearborn]]'s report on fortifications for December 1811 describes the fort as \"an irregular enclosed work of masonry and sod, mounting 18 heavy guns [with] a brick barracks for one company\".<ref>Wade, p. 243</ref> The present fortification replaced the older fort, and was built between 1839 and 1852 as a five-sided, four-bastion coastal defense fort. It could accommodate 42 guns on the seacoast fronts, plus 10 additional guns in two flanking batteries outside the fort, along with flank howitzers in [[bastion]]s for close-in defense.<ref>Weaver, pp. 132-135</ref> The new fort was built under the supervision of Army engineer [[George Washington Cullum]], who later served as superintendent of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]], New York.<ref name = cmh/>\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Fort Trumbull served as an organizational center for Union troops and headquarters for the [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|14th US Infantry Regiment]]. Here, troops were recruited and trained before being sent to war.  Fort Trumbull was briefly commanded by [[John F. Reynolds]], who rose to the rank of major general and was killed at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in 1863.\n\nFrom 1863 to 1879, [[Ordnance Sergeant]] Mark Wentworth Smith was assigned to Fort Trumbull and served as the caretaker of Fort Griswold, which was an un-garrisoned subpost of Fort Trumbull across the Thames River in the town of Groton.  Among other duties, he maintained a vegetable garden to help feed the soldiers at Fort Trumbull.  Smith was born in New Hampshire in 1803 and enlisted in the Army on January 27, 1827 at the age of 23.  He was wounded in action at the [[Battle of Chapultepec]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]].  For unknown reasons, he was allowed to serve on active duty in the Army until his death in 1879 at the age of 76.  He was possibly the oldest enlisted man to serve on active duty in the United States Army in the 19th Century.  (Army Air Forces Master Sergeant [[John W. Westervelt]] served on active duty during World War II until he was retired at age 77 in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.127wg.ang.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123336260 |title=Heaton, Dan, TSgt, \"Heritage Series: Historic Re-enlistment: Oldest Man in Uniform Served at Selfridge\", 127th Wing, Air National Guard website, 13 February 2013 |access-date=18 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103829/http://www.127wg.ang.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123336260 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Chief Torpedoman's Mate Harry S.

Sergeant Smith is buried in the [[Colonel Ledyard Cemetery]] in Groton.\n\nIn the late 1800s Fort Trumbull was modified to accommodate more modern artillery pieces.  Specifically, these artillery pieces were 15-inch and 10-inch Rodman smooth bore guns and 8-inch converted rifles.  Two 8-inch converted rifles are still at Fort Trumbull in a restored firing position.\n\n===20th century===\n====Coast Guard Academy====\n[[File:FT. TRUMBULL, NEW LONDON, CT.jpg|thumb|Fort Trumbull today]]\nAfter the Civil War, Fort Trumbull was improved by having more modern artillery pieces installed. In the early 1900s, several more modern [[Board of Fortifications|Endicott era]] fortifications were built to defend [[Long Island Sound]] as the [[Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound]], including [[Fort Mansfield]] in [[Watch Hill, Rhode Island]], [[Fort H.G. Wright]] on [[Fishers Island]], and [[Fort Michie]] on [[Great Gull Island]]. Fort Trumbull served as the headquarters of these forts until it was turned over to the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] (later renamed the Coast Guard) in 1910 for use as the Revenue Cutter Academy, which was renamed the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] in 1915. The Academy moved to its current location about two miles up the Thames River in 1932.\n\n====Education facility====\nFort Trumbull served as the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] Officers Training School from 1939 to 1946 and trained over 15,000 of the Merchant Marine officers who served during the Second World War.  One of the Merchant Marine officers trained there was actor [[Jack Lord]], who is best known for playing Steve McGarrett on the popular TV series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' in the 1960s and 70s.<ref>[http://www.fortfriends.org/history.htm Fort Trumbull History Site]</ref> The Fort was the site of a satellite campus of the [[University of Connecticut]] from 1946 to 1950, educating war veterans attending college under the [[GI Bill]].\n\n====Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory====\nDuring World War II, Fort Trumbull hosted an office of [[Columbia University]]'s Division of War Research, which developed passive [[sonar]] systems. By 1946, this was consolidated with [[Harvard University]]'s Underwater Sound Laboratory at Fort Trumbull.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=srREi-ScbFcC&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=Navy+Underwater+Sound+Laboratory&source=bl&ots=rXOExsC7Bo&sig=L_sH3iwY_ewPJl6WXyff_EpJT8Y&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uWdmVJ2HPMvsoATyroHoCQ&ved=0CDgQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=Navy%20Underwater%20Sound%20Laboratory&f=false Sherman, Charles H. and Butler, John L., ''Transducers and Arrays for Underwater Sound'', pp.7-8, Springer, 2007] {{ISBN|0-387-32940-4}}.</ref> A result of this work was that Fort Trumbull was the location for the [[Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory]] from 1946 to 1970, which developed sonar and related systems for US Navy submarines. In 1970, the Sound Laboratory was merged with the Naval Underwater Weapons Systems Center (NUWS) to form the [[Naval Underwater Systems Center]] (NUSC) in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. Work continued at both locations until the facility at Fort Trumbull was finally closed in 1996, marking the end of almost a century and a half of Fort Trumbull's service as a federal military facility.\n\n==State park==\n[[File:2013-07-28 Fort Trumbull - Thames Baseball Club.jpg|thumbnail|right|Thames Baseball club playing at Fort Trumbull in New London, CT]]\nAfter a redevelopment period lasting several years, Fort Trumbull was opened as a state park in the year 2000.

Two bodies of troops were landed on either side of the mouth of the Thames River and marched towards Fort Trumbull in New London and [[Fort Griswold]] in Groton.\n\nFort Trumbull fell after little resistance, but about 150 Connecticut militiamen made a gallant stand at Fort Griswold in the [[Battle of Groton Heights]].  The British were finally able to enter the fort, and militia commander Lieutenant Colonel [[William Ledyard]] offered his sword to Major Bromfield, the British commander on the scene, as a token of surrender.  According to contemporaneous accounts, Bromfield took the sword from Ledyard and drove it through him, and the British then proceeded to massacre the surviving defenders.   Eighty-five of the militiamen were killed and the others were either severely wounded, taken prisoner, or managed to escape.\n\nAfter the capture of both forts, the British proceeded to burn New London and then returned to their ships.\n\nAn account of the battle published in a Philadelphia newspaper follows:\n\n<blockquote>- Extract of a letter from New London, dated Sept. 12. </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> ''Arnold had long promised to visit New London and the neighbouring towns on the sea shore, and the enemy having frequently appeared in sight of the harbour, the alarm guns fired on the present occasion were considered by the country around us the salutes of prizes or other vessels belonging to the port.

[[Secretary of War]] [[Henry Dearborn]]'s report on fortifications for December 1811 describes the fort as \"an irregular enclosed work of masonry and sod, mounting 18 heavy guns [with] a brick barracks for one company\".<ref>Wade, p. 243</ref> The present fortification replaced the older fort, and was built between 1839 and 1852 as a five-sided, four-bastion coastal defense fort. It could accommodate 42 guns on the seacoast fronts, plus 10 additional guns in two flanking batteries outside the fort, along with flank howitzers in [[bastion]]s for close-in defense.<ref>Weaver, pp. 132-135</ref> The new fort was built under the supervision of Army engineer [[George Washington Cullum]], who later served as superintendent of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]], New York.<ref name = cmh/>\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Fort Trumbull served as an organizational center for Union troops and headquarters for the [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|14th US Infantry Regiment]]. Here, troops were recruited and trained before being sent to war.  Fort Trumbull was briefly commanded by [[John F. Reynolds]], who rose to the rank of major general and was killed at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in 1863.\n\nFrom 1863 to 1879, [[Ordnance Sergeant]] Mark Wentworth Smith was assigned to Fort Trumbull and served as the caretaker of Fort Griswold, which was an un-garrisoned subpost of Fort Trumbull across the Thames River in the town of Groton.  Among other duties, he maintained a vegetable garden to help feed the soldiers at Fort Trumbull.  Smith was born in New Hampshire in 1803 and enlisted in the Army on January 27, 1827 at the age of 23.  He was wounded in action at the [[Battle of Chapultepec]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]].  For unknown reasons, he was allowed to serve on active duty in the Army until his death in 1879 at the age of 76.  He was possibly the oldest enlisted man to serve on active duty in the United States Army in the 19th Century.  (Army Air Forces Master Sergeant [[John W. Westervelt]] served on active duty during World War II until he was retired at age 77 in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.127wg.ang.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123336260 |title=Heaton, Dan, TSgt, \"Heritage Series: Historic Re-enlistment: Oldest Man in Uniform Served at Selfridge\", 127th Wing, Air National Guard website, 13 February 2013 |access-date=18 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103829/http://www.127wg.ang.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123336260 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Chief Torpedoman's Mate Harry S. Morris was born in 1888 and served in the Navy from 1903 to 1958 when he was \"only\" 70 years old.)   Sergeant Smith is buried in the [[Colonel Ledyard Cemetery]] in Groton.\n\nIn the late 1800s Fort Trumbull was modified to accommodate more modern artillery pieces.  Specifically, these artillery pieces were 15-inch and 10-inch Rodman smooth bore guns and 8-inch converted rifles.  Two 8-inch converted rifles are still at Fort Trumbull in a restored firing position.\n\n===20th century===\n====Coast Guard Academy====\n[[File:FT. TRUMBULL, NEW LONDON, CT.jpg|thumb|Fort Trumbull today]]\nAfter the Civil War, Fort Trumbull was improved by having more modern artillery pieces installed. In the early 1900s, several more modern [[Board of Fortifications|Endicott era]] fortifications were built to defend [[Long Island Sound]] as the [[Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound]], including [[Fort Mansfield]] in [[Watch Hill, Rhode Island]], [[Fort H.G. Wright]] on [[Fishers Island]], and [[Fort Michie]] on [[Great Gull Island]]. Fort Trumbull served as the headquarters of these forts until it was turned over to the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] (later renamed the Coast Guard) in 1910 for use as the Revenue Cutter Academy, which was renamed the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] in 1915. The Academy moved to its current location about two miles up the Thames River in 1932.\n\n====Education facility====\nFort Trumbull served as the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] Officers Training School from 1939 to 1946 and trained over 15,000 of the Merchant Marine officers who served during the Second World War.  One of the Merchant Marine officers trained there was actor [[Jack Lord]], who is best known for playing Steve McGarrett on the popular TV series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' in the 1960s and 70s.<ref>[http://www.fortfriends.org/history.htm Fort Trumbull History Site]</ref> The Fort was the site of a satellite campus of the [[University of Connecticut]] from 1946 to 1950, educating war veterans attending college under the [[GI Bill]].\n\n====Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory====\nDuring World War II, Fort Trumbull hosted an office of [[Columbia University]]'s Division of War Research, which developed passive [[sonar]] systems. By 1946, this was consolidated with [[Harvard University]]'s Underwater Sound Laboratory at Fort Trumbull.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=srREi-ScbFcC&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=Navy+Underwater+Sound+Laboratory&source=bl&ots=rXOExsC7Bo&sig=L_sH3iwY_ewPJl6WXyff_EpJT8Y&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uWdmVJ2HPMvsoATyroHoCQ&ved=0CDgQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=Navy%20Underwater%20Sound%20Laboratory&f=false Sherman, Charles H. and Butler, John L., ''Transducers and Arrays for Underwater Sound'', pp.7-8, Springer, 2007] {{ISBN|0-387-32940-4}}.</ref> A result of this work was that Fort Trumbull was the location for the [[Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory]] from 1946 to 1970, which developed sonar and related systems for US Navy submarines. In 1970, the Sound Laboratory was merged with the Naval Underwater Weapons Systems Center (NUWS) to form the [[Naval Underwater Systems Center]] (NUSC) in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. Work continued at both locations until the facility at Fort Trumbull was finally closed in 1996, marking the end of almost a century and a half of Fort Trumbull's service as a federal military facility.\n\n==State park==\n[[File:2013-07-28 Fort Trumbull - Thames Baseball Club.jpg|thumbnail|right|Thames Baseball club playing at Fort Trumbull in New London, CT]]\nAfter a redevelopment period lasting several years, Fort Trumbull was opened as a state park in the year 2000. It is used as a site for concerts and other special events. The main fort is open to the public and has an elevator to access the upper portions of the fort. There is a museum about the fort in the former officers' quarters.<ref name=DEEP/>\n\n{{Coord|41.3437|-72.0934|type:landmark_region:US|display=title}}\n<!---the following section has been hidden because: A) it contains absolutely no citations or references; B) it contains many undefined abbreviations and strange terminology (\"as of,\" etc.) which does not make sense; C) it is formatted wrong, and should be set as a table vs. individual paragraphs; D)it contains countless editing issues, such as typos, bad spacing, dead links, etc. The overall information is of questionable value.

Its main campus, Ciudad Universitaria Rodrigo Facio,  is located in [[San Pedro, Costa Rica|San Pedro Montes de Oca]], in the province of [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]].  It is the oldest and largest institution of higher learning in Costa Rica, originally established as the ''Universidad de Santo Tom\u00e1s'' in 1843. It is also the most important research university in the country and Central America, plus, considered as one of the most prestigious and recognized in Latin America. Approximately 45,000 students attend UCR throughout the year.\n\n==History==\nThe first institution dedicated to higher education in Costa Rica was the ''University of Saint Thomas'' (''Universidad de Santo Tom\u00e1s''), which was established in 1843.  That institution maintained close ties with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and was closed in 1888 by the progressive and [[anti-clerical]] government of President [[Bernardo Soto Alfaro]] as part of a campaign to modernize public education.  The schools of [[law]], [[agronomy]], [[fine arts]], and [[pharmacy]] continued to operate independently.  In 1940, those four schools were re-united to establish the modern UCR, during the reformist administration of President [[Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n Guardia]].\n\nThe UCR remained the country's sole university until the [[Costa Rica Institute of Technology]] (''Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Costa Rica'') and the [[National University of Costa Rica]] (''Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica'') were opened by the government in 1972 and 1973, respectively.  Years later, in 1979, another public university opened: the [[Distance State University]] (''Universidad Estatal a Distancia''), modeled after the British [[Open University]]. Today, Costa Rica has five public universities (the fifth being the newly created National Technical University), and approximately fifty three small private ones, but the UCR remains the largest and most well funded institution.\n\n==Application==\nCosta Rican applicants to the UCR must take an admission test. This test is similar to the [[SAT]] in the United States. The score of this test is used along with the grades from the student's last years in high school to determine the student's admission score, which is later used to determine admission to a specific major and financial aid. 800 is the highest possible score on the admission test and 442 is the minimum score required for admission. Students who score 800 usually appear in the front pages of Costa Rican newspapers.\n\n[[Undergraduate]] Admission is highly selective, having an acceptance rate of approximately 25%. In 2009, out of the 31.042 that completed the admission test, only 16.593 got above the necessary 442 points to be admitted into the university.  However, being admitted to the university doesn't assure admission to a chosen departmental program, or major. In 2007, only 60% of those admitted to the university got accepted into their chosen major.  The remaining 40% have to take classes that may not work for their major, hoping it will lift their grade point average to the level necessary to be admitted to the program of their liking.\n\nInternational applicants must revalidate their high school certificate and grades from their country of origin at the Ministry of Public Education (''Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica'') in order to apply and take the admission test. [[Graduate school]] applicants must revalidate their undergraduate certificate also.\n\n==Campuses and local branches==\n[[Image:Biblioteca-Carlos-Monge-UCR.JPG|thumb|right|[[Carlos Monge]] Library, a library on the main campus in San Pedro.]]\n\nThe main campus is located on a {{convert|100|ha|adj=on|abbr=on}} campus in San Pedro, San Jos\u00e9 ([[Rodrigo Facio]] campus).

Its main campus, Ciudad Universitaria Rodrigo Facio,  is located in [[San Pedro, Costa Rica|San Pedro Montes de Oca]], in the province of [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]].  It is the oldest and largest institution of higher learning in Costa Rica, originally established as the ''Universidad de Santo Tom\u00e1s'' in 1843. It is also the most important research university in the country and Central America, plus, considered as one of the most prestigious and recognized in Latin America. Approximately 45,000 students attend UCR throughout the year.\n\n==History==\nThe first institution dedicated to higher education in Costa Rica was the ''University of Saint Thomas'' (''Universidad de Santo Tom\u00e1s''), which was established in 1843.  That institution maintained close ties with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and was closed in 1888 by the progressive and [[anti-clerical]] government of President [[Bernardo Soto Alfaro]] as part of a campaign to modernize public education.  The schools of [[law]], [[agronomy]], [[fine arts]], and [[pharmacy]] continued to operate independently.  In 1940, those four schools were re-united to establish the modern UCR, during the reformist administration of President [[Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n Guardia]].\n\nThe UCR remained the country's sole university until the [[Costa Rica Institute of Technology]] (''Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Costa Rica'') and the [[National University of Costa Rica]] (''Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica'') were opened by the government in 1972 and 1973, respectively.  Years later, in 1979, another public university opened: the [[Distance State University]] (''Universidad Estatal a Distancia''), modeled after the British [[Open University]]. Today, Costa Rica has five public universities (the fifth being the newly created National Technical University), and approximately fifty three small private ones, but the UCR remains the largest and most well funded institution.\n\n==Application==\nCosta Rican applicants to the UCR must take an admission test. This test is similar to the [[SAT]] in the United States. The score of this test is used along with the grades from the student's last years in high school to determine the student's admission score, which is later used to determine admission to a specific major and financial aid. 800 is the highest possible score on the admission test and 442 is the minimum score required for admission. Students who score 800 usually appear in the front pages of Costa Rican newspapers.\n\n[[Undergraduate]] Admission is highly selective, having an acceptance rate of approximately 25%. In 2009, out of the 31.042 that completed the admission test, only 16.593 got above the necessary 442 points to be admitted into the university.  However, being admitted to the university doesn't assure admission to a chosen departmental program, or major. In 2007, only 60% of those admitted to the university got accepted into their chosen major.  The remaining 40% have to take classes that may not work for their major, hoping it will lift their grade point average to the level necessary to be admitted to the program of their liking.\n\nInternational applicants must revalidate their high school certificate and grades from their country of origin at the Ministry of Public Education (''Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica'') in order to apply and take the admission test. [[Graduate school]] applicants must revalidate their undergraduate certificate also.\n\n==Campuses and local branches==\n[[Image:Biblioteca-Carlos-Monge-UCR.JPG|thumb|right|[[Carlos Monge]] Library, a library on the main campus in San Pedro.]]\n\nThe main campus is located on a {{convert|100|ha|sing=on|abbr=on}} campus in San Pedro, San Jos\u00e9 ([[Rodrigo Facio]] campus). Other regional campuses are located throughout the country to reach rural Costa Ricans. The regional options are:\n\n* Western Campus (In the city of [[San Ram\u00f3n, Costa Rica|San Ramon]], [[Alajuela Province|Alajuela]]): includes a local branch in [[Tacares]], [[Grecia (canton)|Grecia]]\n* Atlantic Campus (In the city of [[Turrialba]], [[Cartago Province|Cartago]]): includes a local branch in [[Para\u00edso, Costa Rica|Para\u00edso]], [[Cartago Province|Cartago]] and another one in [[Gu\u00e1piles]], [[Lim\u00f3n Province|Lim\u00f3n]]\n* Guanacaste Campus (In the city of [[Liberia, Costa Rica|Liberia]], [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]]): includes a local branch in [[Santa Cruz Canton, Costa Rica|Santa Cruz]]\n* Limon Campus (In the City of [[Lim\u00f3n|Port Lim\u00f3n]], [[Limon Province|Limon)]].\n* Pacific Campus (In the city of [[Puntarenas]], [[Puntarenas Province|Puntarenas]]).\n* The [[Golfito]] Campus (Southern Pacific coast) (in the City of [[Golfito]], [[Puntarenas Province|Puntarenas]]). \n\nThe main campus in San Pedro offers the most diverse{{what|date=July 2018}} course curricula of any other campus, in addition to hosting the Medical School, and graduate programs.\n\n==Social relevance==\n\nThe university, while neutral on most aspects of Costa Rican life, defines itself as a secular and humanist institution.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The university encourages social work and social research activities and in order to graduate most students must work in the {{lang|es|Trabajo Comunal Universitario}} (University Community Service), which is organized by the university.  The university maintains a prestigious position in Costa Rican society{{cn|date=July 2018}} and is the most often cited governmental institution in Costa Rican [[News media|media]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Opinions generated on scientific, [[ethical]] and economic matters strongly influence Costa Rican policies and public sentiment. Costa Rican law requires the Costa Rican Congress to request from the UCR (amongst other institutions) its opinion on whether a new law should be approved or not.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe UCR counts Costa Rica's [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Oscar Arias]], ex-Presidents, many ministers, and many heads of the country's public institutions as alumni.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe UCR is also part of the {{lang|es|Consejo Nacional de Rectores}} (National Council of University Rectors), a watchdog body that overviews higher education quality, and recognition of university-level degrees from foreign countries.\n\nFor many years, UCR grew in close partnership with public action of the State, forming the professional staff necessary for the growth of new public institutions such as the [[Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad]] (ICE), the Costa Rican Social Security Fund may Social{{clarify|date=May 2019}} (CCSS) and the State Bank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.cr/2015/05/06/rector-reitera-compromiso-de-la-universidad-con-costa-rica/|title=Rector reitera compromiso de la Universidad con Costa Rica \u2013 Diario Digital Nuestro Pa\u00eds|author=Ucr Odi|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Reputation and rankings==\n{{Infobox world university ranking\n| QS_W = 511-520 | QS_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universidad-de-costa-rica|title=Academic Ranking of World Universities 2019|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref>\n| QS_LA = 19 | QS_LA_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/latin-american-university-rankings/2019|title=QS Latin America Rankings 2019|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|THE_W = 601-800 | THE_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-costa-rica|title=University of Costa Rica|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|THE_LA = 37  | THE_LA_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-costa-rica|title=University of Costa Rica|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\nCurrently, the university occupies the first place in Central America and the Caribbean, 19th place in Latin America <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/latin-american-university-rankings/2019|title=QS Latin America Rankings 2019|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref> and 511-520th place worldwide <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universidad-de-costa-rica|title=Academic Ranking of World Universities 2019|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref> in the [[QS World University Rankings]].
