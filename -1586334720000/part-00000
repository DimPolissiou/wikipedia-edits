He authored Assembly Bill 1113, concerning provisional driver's licenses, which sought to strengthen teen driver-licensing programs and improve the safety of the roadways.  He also authored Assembly Bill 417, which lessened the processes needed to authorize bike lanes in urbanized areas.  He authored Assembly Bill 513, which expands the use of [[rubberized asphalt]] (made from [[waste tires]]) in roads and other transportation projects. And he authored Assembly Bill 1336, which provides the state with added enforcement powers necessary to ensure that workers are paid mandated wages.<ref>{{cite news |title=Assemblyman Jim Frazier's legislation still on governor's desk |url=http://www.thereporter.com/general-news/20130926/assemblyman-jim-fraziers-legislation-still-on-governors-desk |newspaper=[[The Reporter (Vacaville)|The Reporter]] |date=September 26, 2013 |accessdate=March 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2014-15 legislative session, Frazier served as Chair of the Assembly Transportation Committee.

Frazier Jr.''' (born May 4, 1959) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] currently serving in the [[California State Assembly]]. He is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] representing the [[California's 11th State Assembly district|11th Assembly District]], which encompasses East Contra Costa County, Solano County and a portion of rural Sacramento County.\n\nPrior to being elected to the Assembly in 2012, he was an [[Oakley, California|Oakley]] City Councilmember and [[Mayor]].\n\n== Legislative career ==\n\nDuring his first term, Frazier's legislation focused on roadway safety and infrastructure.  He authored Assembly Bill 1113, concerning provisional driver's licenses, which sought to strengthen teen driver-licensing programs and improve the safety of the roadways.  He also authored Assembly Bill 417, which lessened the processes needed to authorize bike lanes in urbanized areas.  He authored Assembly Bill 513, which expands the use of [[rubberized asphalt]] (made from [[waste tires]]) in roads and other transportation projects. And he authored Assembly Bill 1336, which provides the state with added enforcement powers necessary to ensure that workers are paid mandated wages.<ref>{{cite news |title=Assemblyman Jim Frazier's legislation still on governor's desk |url=http://www.thereporter.com/general-news/20130926/assemblyman-jim-fraziers-legislation-still-on-governors-desk |newspaper=[[The Reporter (Vacaville)|The Reporter]] |date=September 26, 2013 |accessdate=March 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2014-15 legislative session, Frazier served as Chair of the Assembly Transportation Committee.

Production involved the collaboration of [[Sega Sammy]]'s Japanese studio [[Marza Animation Planet]], with Fowler brought in to direct in 2016. After Sony put the project in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired it in 2017. The majority of the cast signed on by August 2018, and principal filming took place between September and October that year in [[Vancouver]] and on [[Vancouver Island]]. Following the negative reaction to the first trailer in 2019, the film's release was delayed by three months to redesign Sonic.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' premiered at the [[Paramount Theatre (Los Angeles)|Paramount Theatre]] on January 25, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States on February 14, 2020.

His guardian, Longclaw the Owl, gives him a bag of rings that can create portals to other planets, using one to send him to Earth while she protects him from the echidnas. Ten years later, Sonic enjoys a secret life near the town of [[Green Hill Zone|Green Hills]], [[Montana]], but longs to make friends. He idolizes the local sheriff, Tom Wachowski, and his veterinarian wife, Maddie, unaware the pair are planning to relocate to [[San Francisco]] soon, as Tom has been hired by the [[San Francisco Police Department]].\n\nOne night, Sonic becomes upset over his loneliness when playing baseball by himself, and runs at supersonic speed as a result, inadvertently triggering an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that knocks out power across the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Roboticist and scientific genius [[Doctor Eggman|Doctor Robotnik]] is enlisted by the [[United States Department of Defense]] to uncover the source of the outage. Robotnik discovers and tracks Sonic, who hides in the Wachowskis' shed. Tom discovers Sonic and accidentally shoots him with a tranquilizer, causing him to send his bag of rings through a portal to San Francisco. Tom reluctantly agrees to help Sonic before Robotnik arrives at the Wachowskis' house and the two flee. As the pair evade Robotnik, who labels Tom a [[domestic terrorist]], they slowly bond, with Tom learning about Sonic's desire for a real friend.\n\nRobotnik comes across one of Sonic's quills, discovering the power in it has the potential to fuel his robots, and becomes obsessed with capturing Sonic. As he tracks them down, Tom discusses his plans to leave Green Hills, which Sonic disapproves of. Shortly after defeating a robot sent by Robotnik, an explosion injures Sonic. Arriving at San Francisco, Tom brings him to Maddie, who revives him. While Tom explains about their situation to Maddie, Sonic receives a new pair of sneakers from Maddie's niece. The group soon head to the roof of the [[Transamerica Pyramid]], where Sonic's bag of rings landed, and recover them. Robotnik arrives in a hovercraft and attacks them, forcing Sonic to use a ring to send Tom and Maddie back to Green Hills.\n\nSonic flees from Robotnik, who uses the power of Sonic's quill to match his speed. The two engage in a chase across the world, ultimately returning to Green Hills. Robotnik incapacitates Sonic, but Tom intervenes, allowing Sonic to regain his strength and reclaim his lost energy. Overcoming Robotnik, Sonic defeats him by sending him to another planet. Following the incident, Tom and Maddie decide to stay in Green Hills and let Sonic live with them. The US government erases all evidence of the events, including records of Robotnik's existence. Meanwhile, Robotnik, still in possession of Sonic's quill and having lost his sanity, begins plotting his revenge. On Earth, [[Tails (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Tails]], a twin-tailed fox from Sonic's world, emerges from a ring portal in search of Sonic.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Schwartz]] as the voice of [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]: An anthropomorphic blue hedgehog with [[superhuman speed]] who is on the run from Robotnik and the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]].

[[Michealene Risley]], the newly appointed consumer products director who helped greenlight ''Adventures'', negotiated with several [[Hollywood]] producers.

Jefferies' treatment, entitled ''Sonic the Hedgehog: Wonders of the World'', was submitted in May 1995. While the draft received a positive response among MGM and Sega executives, Sega COO [[Shinobu Toyoda]] suggested Kalinske replace Robotnik with a meaner villain.

In the film, Sonic teams up with local town sheriff Tom Wachowski to find his lost rings and escape Dr. Robotnik.\n\nDevelopment for a film began in the 1990s, but did not go beyond the planning stage until [[Sony Pictures]] acquired the film rights in 2013. Production involved the collaboration of [[Sega Sammy]]'s Japanese studio [[Marza Animation Planet]], with Fowler brought in to direct in 2016. After Sony put the project in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired it in 2017. The majority of the cast signed on by August 2018, and principal filming took place between September and October that year in [[Vancouver]] and on [[Vancouver Island]]. Following the negative reaction to the first trailer in 2019, the film's release was delayed by three months to redesign Sonic.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' premiered at the [[Paramount Theatre (Los Angeles)|Paramount Theatre]] on January 25, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States on February 14, 2020. Critics praised the performances, Sonic's design, and its faithfulness to the source material, but criticized its plot and perceived lack of originality.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sonic-hedgehog-review-roundup-what-critics-are-saying-1279272 |title='Sonic the Hedgehog': What the Critics Are Saying |last=Graeme McMillan |date=February 13, 2020 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200217234246/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sonic-hedgehog-review-roundup-what-critics-are-saying-1279272 |archive-date=February 17, 2020 |access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/sonic-hedgehog-movie-reviews-mixed-reason-why/ |title=Why Sonic The Hedgehog's Reviews Are So Mixed |last=Kayleigh Donaldson |date=February 15, 2020 |website=Screen Rant |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200217233931/https://screenrant.com/sonic-hedgehog-movie-reviews-mixed-reason-why/ |archive-date=February 17, 2020 |access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref> The film set the record for the biggest opening weekend for a [[List of films based on video games|video game film]] in the United States and Canada.

His guardian, Longclaw the Owl, gives him a bag of rings that can create portals to other planets, using one to send him to Earth while she protects him from the echidnas. Ten years later, Sonic enjoys a secret life near the town of [[Green Hill Zone|Green Hills]], [[Montana]], but longs to make friends. He idolizes the local sheriff, Tom Wachowski, and his veterinarian wife, Maddie, unaware the pair are planning to relocate to [[San Francisco]] soon, as Tom has been hired by the [[San Francisco Police Department]].\n\nOne night, Sonic becomes upset over his loneliness when playing baseball by himself, and runs at supersonic speed as a result, inadvertently triggering an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that knocks out power across the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Roboticist and scientific genius [[Doctor Eggman|Doctor Robotnik]] is enlisted by the [[United States Department of Defense]] to uncover the source of the outage. Robotnik discovers and tracks Sonic, who hides in the Wachowskis' shed. Tom discovers Sonic and accidentally shoots him with a tranquilizer, causing him to send his bag of rings through a portal to San Francisco. Tom reluctantly agrees to help Sonic before Robotnik arrives at the Wachowskis' house and the two flee. As the pair evade Robotnik, who labels Tom a [[domestic terrorist]], they slowly bond, with Tom learning about Sonic's desire for a real friend.\n\nRobotnik comes across one of Sonic's quills, discovering the power in it has the potential to fuel his robots, and becomes obsessed with capturing Sonic. As he tracks them down, Tom discusses his plans to leave Green Hills, which Sonic disapproves of. Shortly after defeating a robot sent by Robotnik, an explosion injures Sonic. Arriving at San Francisco, Tom brings him to Maddie, who revives him. While Tom explains about their situation to Maddie, Sonic receives a new pair of sneakers from Maddie's niece. The group soon head to the roof of the [[Transamerica Pyramid]], where Sonic's bag of rings landed, and recover them. Robotnik arrives in a hovercraft and attacks them, forcing Sonic to use a ring to send Tom and Maddie back to Green Hills.\n\nSonic flees from Robotnik, who uses the power of Sonic's quill to match his speed. The two engage in a chase across the world, ultimately returning to Green Hills. Robotnik incapacitates Sonic, but Tom intervenes, allowing Sonic to regain his strength and reclaim his lost energy. Overcoming Robotnik, Sonic defeats him by sending him to another planet. Following the incident, Tom and Maddie decide to stay in Green Hills and let Sonic live with them. The US government erases all evidence of the events, including records of Robotnik's existence. Meanwhile, Robotnik, still in possession of Sonic's quill and having lost his sanity, begins plotting his revenge. On Earth, [[Tails (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Tails]], a twin-tailed fox from Sonic's world, emerges from a ring portal in search of Sonic.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Schwartz]] as the voice of [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]: An anthropomorphic blue hedgehog with [[superhuman speed]] who is on the run from Robotnik and the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]].

[[Michealene Risley]], the newly appointed consumer products director who helped greenlight ''Adventures'', negotiated with several [[Hollywood]] producers. [[Sega]] CEO [[Tom Kalinske]], however, was wary of damaging the brand, citing the commercial and critical failures of the ''[[Super Mario Bros.

Jefferies' treatment, entitled ''Sonic the Hedgehog: Wonders of the World'', was submitted in May 1995.

It marked the culmination of the [[1982 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the third edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], but was the first time a final had been held; both the previous events had been [[round-robin tournament]]s. Both Australia and England had previously won the competition; England won [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|the inaugural tournament in 1973]], while Australia won [[1978 Women's Cricket World Cup|in 1978]]. Australia won the match [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|by three wickets]] to claim their second world title.\n\nAustralia and England finished first and second in the league-stage to claim their places in the final. Australia had gone unbeaten throughout the round-robin, having won eleven of their matches and [[Tie (cricket)|tied]] with England in the other. England had won seven of their matches, lost three and tied twice, and finished 14 points behind Australia and 6 ahead of New Zealand. The final was [[Umpire (cricket)|umpired]] by [[Dickie Bird]] and [[Fred Goodall]]. England [[Batting (cricket)|batted]] first in the final, and scored slowly, particularly against Australia's [[spin bowling]]. [[Jan Southgate]] top-scored for England with 53 [[Run (cricket)|runs]], as they made 151 for five. In response, Australia initially struggled, losing their first three wickets for 28 runs. A [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] between [[Karen Read]] and [[Sharon Tredrea]] recovered their [[innings]], before quick scoring from [[Jen Jacobs]] and [[Marie Cornish]] saw them to victory.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[1982 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the third [[Women's Cricket World Cup]].

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

These were supported by their new sponsors [[Emirates Airlines]]. With two available slots to fill, the Kings XI Punjab made bids on [[Jerome Taylor]] and [[Yusuf Abdulla]] at the second IPL auction.\n\nThe team took a hit as most of their Australian cricketers were unavailable. The team lacked available pace bowlers after Jerome Taylor backed out at the last minute with an injury.\n\nThe team lost badly to the [[Delhi Daredevils]] and the [[Kolkata Knight Riders]], however, they returned to form by beating the [[Royal Challengers]], the Rajasthan Royals and the [[Mumbai Indians]]. Then the team witnessed a roller-coaster ride in their next eight matches with four wins and four losses. The team's semi-final hopes were crushed after losing to the [[Chennai Super Kings]] in their last match.\n\n===2010===\nKings XI Punjab lost six matches to the Kolkata Knight Riders, the Delhi Daredevils, the [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]], the [[Deccan Chargers]], the Rajasthan Royals and the Mumbai Indians but managed to win a match against Chennai Super Kings when the scores were level and the match went to a Super Over. Kings XI Punjab were boosted by the return of Brett Lee against Kolkata, but he was not at his best. Shaun Marsh returned in the match against the Mumbai Indians. In spite of his good performance, which included a half century, the team lost the match. They ended IPL3 in the last position.\n\n===2011===\n\nThe 2011 IPL season looked promising when they brought a full strength team with [[Michael Bevan]] as coach and [[Adam Gilchrist]] was appointed as captain.\n\nKings XI Punjab missed out on the play offs by two points (or one victory). This meant they finished fifth in the points table.\n\n===2012===\n\nKings XI Punjab finished in sixth place overall, winning eight matches out of sixteen.\n\n===2013===\n\nKings XI Punjab failed to qualify for the play-offs, but batsman [[David Miller (cricketer)|David Miller]] played one of the innings of the tournament in the 51st match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, as he smashed 101 off 38 deliveries and included eight fours and seven sixes. Coming in at 51\u20133 in the eighth over and chasing a target of 190, Miller rectified the game and led Punjab to a six-wicket win with two overs remaining. Adam Gilchrist retired at the end of the season.\n\n===2014===\n\nAustralia's T20I captain [[George Bailey (cricketer, born 1982)|George Bailey]] was leading the squad for the seventh season. Other buys featured the likes of [[Virender Sehwag]], [[Glenn Maxwell]] and [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]]. Kings XI Punjab began the tournament by winning their first five games which were held outside India in UAE due to elections. The stand out player was Glenn Maxwell with his unorthodox and powerful hitting, scoring 95, 89 and 95 in his first three innings with a strike rate of over 200 who got equal contribution from South African David Miller, both of them making the side look invincible. There were many innings from the veteran Indian batsman Virender Sehwag and young star [[Manan Vohra]] which made the middle order batting easy and allowed the team to qualify for the playoffs. Due to a 122 run knock from Virender Sehwag against the Chennai Super Kings in the semifinal, KXIP made their way to the final. There they faced the Kolkata Knight Riders where they batted first and set a good target of 199 owing to [[Wriddhiman Saha]]'s 115.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2014/news/225143-after-kolkata-knight-riders-west-bengal-plan-to-fete-ipl-final-centurion-wriddhiman-saha|title=After Kolkata Knight Riders, West Bengal Plan to Fete IPL Final Centurion Wriddhiman Saha |author=Soumitra Bose |website=[[NDTV]] |date=4 June 2014 |accessdate=10 March 2018 }}</ref> However, due to [[Manish Pandey]]'s 94 off 50 balls and his teammates' consistently high run rate, including [[Piyush Chawla]]'s 13 off five balls, KKR were able to win the final by three wickets in the final over of the match.\n\n====2014 CLT20====\n\nKings XI were placed in Group B along with the [[Hobart Hurricanes]] (Australia); the [[Barbados Tridents]] (West Indies); the [[Cape Cobras]] (South Africa) and the [[Northern Districts cricket team|Northern Knights]] (New Zealand).\n\nKings XI's first match was in their home stadium the [[PCA Stadium]], [[Mohali]] where they beat Hobart Hurricanes by five wickets, overhauling Hobart's 144\u20136 in 17.4 overs.

The team finished eighth once again with only four wins. Murali Vijay was the top scorer with 453 runs and Sandeep Sharma was the top wicket taker with 15 wickets.\n\n===2017===\n\nVirender Sehwag joined as head coach as the team looked to recover from two back-to-back last-place finishes in the league. Glenn Maxwell was appointed as the captain. [[Eoin Morgan]], [[Darren Sammy]] and [[Hashim Amla]] joined the likes of David Miller in the team. The team missed out on a place in the play-offs by a last game defeat to the [[Rising Pune Supergiant]] and ended the season in fifth, winning seven out of their 14 games. Hashim Amla finished the season as top scorer with 420 runs including two centuries, and Sandeep Sharma was the top wicket taker with 17 wickets.\n\n===2018===\nThe Kings XI Punjab squad for the 2018 IPL season included internationals such as: [[Ravichandran Ashwin]], [[Yuvraj Singh]], [[KL Rahul]], [[Aaron Finch]] and [[Chris Gayle]]. Ashwin was appointed as captain and [[Brad Hodge]] as coach. The Tournament started well with KL Rahul scoring a fine fifty off 14 balls to guide KXIP home against Daredevils. Riding on KL Rahul and Chris Gayle's red hot form at the top and Andrew Tye and Mujeeb with ball, the team went on to win 6 out of their first seven games eventually becoming favourites to the title. Their weakness in Indian core was however exposed as they could manage just one win in next eight and ultimately not being qualified for playoffs despite a dream start from the beginning.\n\n===2019===\nFranchises confirmed the names of retained players for the 12th season of Indian Premier League. KXIP retained the following players for the 2019 season: KL Rahul, Chris Gayle, [[Andrew Tye]], [[Mayank Agarwal]], [[Ankit Rajpoot]], [[Mujeeb Ur Rahman]], [[Karun Nair]], David Miller and Ravichandran Ashwin. On the auction day (18 December 2018), KXIP snapped up new 13 players: Varun Chakaravarthy, [[Sam Curran]], [[Mohammed Shami]], Prabhsimran Singh, [[Nicholas Pooran]], [[Moises Henriques]], [[Hardus Viljoen]], [[Darshan Nalkande]], [[Sarfaraz Khan]], Arshdeep Singh, Agnivesh Ayachi, Harpreet Brar, and [[Murugan Ashwin]].<ref>{{cite web |title=IPL 2019 Auction: Varun Chakravarathy 'over the moon' after bagging million-dollar deal|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/varun-chakaravarthy-ipl-2019-auction-indian-premier-league-kings-xi-punjab-1412473-2018-12-18 |website=[[India Today]]|author= |date=18 December 2018 |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nKings XI Punjab ended up in sixth position in the league table.

With two available slots to fill, the Kings XI Punjab made bids on [[Jerome Taylor]] and [[Yusuf Abdulla]] at the second IPL auction.\n\nThe team took a hit as most of their Australian cricketers were unavailable. The team lacked available pace bowlers after Jerome Taylor backed out at the last minute with an injury.\n\nThe team lost badly to the [[Delhi Daredevils]] and the [[Kolkata Knight Riders]], however, they returned to form by beating the [[Royal Challengers]], the Rajasthan Royals and the [[Mumbai Indians]]. Then the team witnessed a roller-coaster ride in their next eight matches with four wins and four losses. The team's semi-final hopes were crushed after losing to the [[Chennai Super Kings]] in their last match.\n\n===2010===\nKings XI Punjab lost six matches to the Kolkata Knight Riders, the Delhi Daredevils, the [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]], the [[Deccan Chargers]], the Rajasthan Royals and the Mumbai Indians but managed to win a match against Chennai Super Kings when the scores were level and the match went to a Super Over. Kings XI Punjab were boosted by the return of Brett Lee against Kolkata, but he was not at his best. Shaun Marsh returned in the match against the Mumbai Indians. In spite of his good performance, which included a half century, the team lost the match. They ended IPL3 in the last position.\n\n===2011===\n\nThe 2011 IPL season looked promising when they brought a full strength team with [[Michael Bevan]] as coach and [[Adam Gilchrist]] was appointed as captain.\n\nKings XI Punjab missed out on the play offs by two points (or one victory). This meant they finished fifth in the points table.\n\n===2012===\n\nKings XI Punjab finished in sixth place overall, winning eight matches out of sixteen.\n\n===2013===\n\nKings XI Punjab failed to qualify for the play-offs, but batsman [[David Miller (cricketer)|David Miller]] played one of the innings of the tournament in the 51st match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, as he smashed 101 off 38 deliveries and included eight fours and seven sixes. Coming in at 51\u20133 in the eighth over and chasing a target of 190, Miller rectified the game and led Punjab to a six-wicket win with two overs remaining. Adam Gilchrist retired at the end of the season.\n\n===2014===\n\nAustralia's T20I captain [[George Bailey (cricketer, born 1982)|George Bailey]] was leading the squad for the seventh season. Other buys featured the likes of [[Virender Sehwag]], [[Glenn Maxwell]] and [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]]. Kings XI Punjab began the tournament by winning their first five games which were held outside India in UAE due to elections. The stand out player was Glenn Maxwell with his unorthodox and powerful hitting, scoring 95, 89 and 95 in his first three innings with a strike rate of over 200 who got equal contribution from South African David Miller, both of them making the side look invincible. There were many innings from the veteran Indian batsman Virender Sehwag and young star [[Manan Vohra]] which made the middle order batting easy and allowed the team to qualify for the playoffs. Due to a 122 run knock from Virender Sehwag against the Chennai Super Kings in the semifinal, KXIP made their way to the final. There they faced the Kolkata Knight Riders where they batted first and set a good target of 199 owing to [[Wriddhiman Saha]]'s 115.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2014/news/225143-after-kolkata-knight-riders-west-bengal-plan-to-fete-ipl-final-centurion-wriddhiman-saha|title=After Kolkata Knight Riders, West Bengal Plan to Fete IPL Final Centurion Wriddhiman Saha |author=Soumitra Bose |website=[[NDTV]] |date=4 June 2014 |accessdate=10 March 2018 }}</ref> However, due to [[Manish Pandey]]'s 94 off 50 balls and his teammates' consistently high run rate, including [[Piyush Chawla]]'s 13 off five balls, KKR were able to win the final by three wickets in the final over of the match.\n\n====2014 CLT20====\n\nKings XI were placed in Group B along with the [[Hobart Hurricanes]] (Australia); the [[Barbados Tridents]] (West Indies); the [[Cape Cobras]] (South Africa) and the [[Northern Districts cricket team|Northern Knights]] (New Zealand).\n\nKings XI's first match was in their home stadium the [[PCA Stadium]], [[Mohali]] where they beat Hobart Hurricanes by five wickets, overhauling Hobart's 144\u20136 in 17.4 overs. [[Thisara Perera]] was named the Man Of The Match with 2\u201317 and 35. Glenn Maxwell top scored in the game with 43. They also won the second match beating the Barbados Tridents by four wickets. They won their third match of the competition against the [[Northern Knights]] and qualified for the semi finals. They continued to win their final group match against the Cape Cobras but were knocked out of the tournament at the semi-final stage with a disappointing defeat against their IPL rivals the Chennai Super Kings,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Match Report: SF2 - Kings XI Punjab V Chennai Super Kings|url = http://www.clt20.com/news/2014/match-reports/2364/match-report-sf2-kings-xi-punjab-v-chennai-super-kings|website = Champions League T20 |author=Arun Gopalakrishnan |location=Mumbai |date=2 October 2014 |accessdate = 21 April 2015}}</ref> who went on to win the tournament.\n\n===2015===\n\nGeorge Bailey continued to lead the side during the 2015 season. The team won just three of the 14 games and finishing eighth in the league. David Miller finished the season as top scorer with 357 runs and Anureet Singh finished the season as the top wicket taker with 15 wickets.\n\n===2016===\n\nDavid Miller and Murali Vijay captained the team in the first and second half of the 2016 season. The team finished eighth once again with only four wins. Murali Vijay was the top scorer with 453 runs and Sandeep Sharma was the top wicket taker with 15 wickets.\n\n===2017===\n\nVirender Sehwag joined as head coach as the team looked to recover from two back-to-back last-place finishes in the league. Glenn Maxwell was appointed as the captain. [[Eoin Morgan]], [[Darren Sammy]] and [[Hashim Amla]] joined the likes of David Miller in the team. The team missed out on a place in the play-offs by a last game defeat to the [[Rising Pune Supergiant]] and ended the season in fifth, winning seven out of their 14 games. Hashim Amla finished the season as top scorer with 420 runs including two centuries, and Sandeep Sharma was the top wicket taker with 17 wickets.\n\n===2018===\nThe Kings XI Punjab squad for the 2018 IPL season included internationals such as: [[Ravichandran Ashwin]], [[Yuvraj Singh]], [[KL Rahul]], [[Aaron Finch]] and [[Chris Gayle]]. Ashwin was appointed as captain and [[Brad Hodge]] as coach. The Tournament started well with KL Rahul scoring a fine fifty off 14 balls to guide KXIP home against Daredevils. Riding on KL Rahul and Chris Gayle's red hot form at the top and Andrew Tye and Mujeeb with ball, the team went on to win 6 out of their first seven games eventually becoming favourites to the title. Their weakness in Indian core was however exposed as they could manage just one win in next eight and ultimately not being qualified for playoffs despite a dream start from the beginning.\n\n===2019===\nFranchises confirmed the names of retained players for the 12th season of Indian Premier League. KXIP retained the following players for the 2019 season: KL Rahul, Chris Gayle, [[Andrew Tye]], [[Mayank Agarwal]], [[Ankit Rajpoot]], [[Mujeeb Ur Rahman]], [[Karun Nair]], David Miller and Ravichandran Ashwin. On the auction day (18 December 2018), KXIP snapped up new 13 players: Varun Chakaravarthy, [[Sam Curran]], [[Mohammed Shami]], Prabhsimran Singh, [[Nicholas Pooran]], [[Moises Henriques]], [[Hardus Viljoen]], [[Darshan Nalkande]], [[Sarfaraz Khan]], Arshdeep Singh, Agnivesh Ayachi, Harpreet Brar, and [[Murugan Ashwin]].<ref>{{cite web |title=IPL 2019 Auction: Varun Chakravarathy 'over the moon' after bagging million-dollar deal|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/varun-chakaravarthy-ipl-2019-auction-indian-premier-league-kings-xi-punjab-1412473-2018-12-18 |website=[[India Today]]|author= |date=18 December 2018 |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nKings XI Punjab ended up in sixth position in the league table.

He was the country's first indigenous head of government and played a significant role in the transformation of Kenya from [[Kenya Colony|a colony]] of the [[British Empire]] into an independent republic. Ideologically an [[African nationalist]] and [[conservative]], he led the [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) party from 1961 until his death.\n\n<!--Early life, childhood through to imprisonment-->\nKenyatta was born to [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] farmers in [[Kiambu]], [[British East Africa]]. Educated at a [[mission school]], he worked in various jobs before becoming politically engaged through the [[Kikuyu Central Association]]. In 1929, he travelled to London to lobby for Kikuyu land affairs. During the 1930s, he studied at Moscow's [[Communist University of the Toilers of the East]], [[University College London]], and the [[London School of Economics]]. In 1938, he published [[Facing Mount Kenya|an anthropological study of Kikuyu life]] before working as a farm labourer in [[Sussex]] during the [[Second World War]]. Influenced by his friend [[George Padmore]], he embraced anti-colonialist and [[Pan-African]] ideas, co-organising the 1945 [[Pan-African Congress]] in [[Manchester]]. He returned to Kenya in 1946 and became a school principal. In 1947, he was elected President of the [[Kenya African Union]], through which he lobbied for independence from British colonial rule, attracting widespread indigenous support but animosity from [[White Kenyans|white settlers]]. In 1952, he was among the [[Kapenguria Six]] arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial [[Mau Mau Uprising]]. Although protesting his innocence\u2014a view shared by later historians\u2014he was convicted. He remained imprisoned at [[Lokitaung]] until 1959 and then exiled in [[Lodwar]] until 1961.\n\n<!--Later life; premiership and presidency-->\nOn his release, Kenyatta became President of KANU and led the party to victory in the [[1963 Kenyan general election|1963 general election]]. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the transition of the [[Kenya Colony]] into an independent republic, of which he became President in 1964. Desiring a [[one-party state]], he transferred regional powers to his central government, suppressed political dissent, and prohibited KANU's only rival\u2014[[Jaramogi Oginga Odinga|Oginga Odinga]]'s leftist [[Kenya People's Union]]\u2014from competing in elections. He promoted reconciliation between the country's indigenous ethnic groups and its European minority, although his relations with the [[Indians in Kenya|Kenyan Indians]] were strained and Kenya's army clashed with [[Somali-Kenyan conflict|Somali separatists]] in the [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]] during the [[Shifta War]]. His government pursued [[capitalist]] economic policies and the \"Africanisation\" of the economy, prohibiting non-citizens from controlling key industries. Education and healthcare were expanded, while UK-funded land redistribution favoured KANU loyalists and exacerbated ethnic tensions. Under Kenyatta, Kenya joined the [[Organisation of African Unity]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], espousing a pro-[[Western world|Western]] and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] foreign policy amid the [[Cold War]]. Kenyatta died in office and was succeeded by [[Daniel arap Moi]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nKenyatta was a controversial figure. Prior to Kenyan independence, many of its white settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, he was given the honorary title of '''Mzee''' and lauded as the [[Father of the Nation]], securing support from both the black majority and the white minority with his message of reconciliation. Conversely, his rule was criticised as dictatorial, [[authoritarian]], and [[neo-colonialism|neo-colonial]], of favouring Kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of facilitating the growth of widespread [[Corruption in Kenya|corruption]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: c.1890\u20131914===\n\n[[File:Kikuyu village 02.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Kikuyu house similar to that in which Kenyatta would have lived in Nginda.]]\n\nA member of the [[Kikuyu people]], Kenyatta was born in the village of Nginda.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=34|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=38}} Birth records were not then kept among the Kikuyu, and Kenyatta's date of birth is not known.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=33|2a1=Arnold|2y=1974|2p=11|3a1=Assensoh|3y=1998|3p=38}} One biographer, Jules Archer, suggested he was likely born in 1890,{{sfn|Archer|1969|p=11}} although a fuller analysis by Jeremy Murray-Brown suggested a birth ''circa'' 1897 or 1898.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=323}} Kenyatta's father was named Muigai, and his mother Wambui.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=34|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=38}} They lived in a homestead near the [[River Thiririka]], where they raised crops and bred sheep and goats.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=34|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=38}} Muigai was sufficiently wealthy that he could afford to keep several wives, each living in a separate ''ny\u016bmba'' (woman's hut).{{sfn|Archer|1969|pp=11, 14\u201315}}\n\nKenyatta was raised according to traditional Kikuyu custom and belief, and was taught the skills needed to herd the family flock.{{sfnm|1a1=Archer|1y=1969|1pp=13\u201314, 16|2a1=Murray-Brown|2y=1974|2pp=35\u201336}} When he was ten, his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition from childhood.{{sfn|Archer|1969|p=17}} Wambui subsequently bore another son, Kongo,{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=35}} shortly before Muigai died.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=37}} In keeping with Kikuyu tradition, Wambui then married her late husband's younger brother, Ngengi.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=37}} Kenyatta then took the name of Kamau wa Ngengi (\"Kamau, son of Ngengi\").{{sfnm|1a1=Archer|1y=1969|1p=11|2a1=Murray-Brown|2y=1974|2p=42|3a1=Arnold|3y=1974|3p=15}} Wambui bore her new husband a son, whom they also named Muigai.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=37}} Ngengi was harsh and resentful toward the three boys, and Wambui decided to take her youngest son to live with her parental family further north.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=37}} It was there that she died, and Kenyatta\u2014who was very fond of the younger Muigai\u2014travelled to collect his infant half-brother.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=37}} Kenyatta then moved in with his grandfather, Kongo wa Magana, and assisted the latter in his role as a [[Traditional medicine|traditional healer]].{{sfnm|1a1=Archer|1y=1969|1p=18|2a1=Murray-Brown|2y=1974|2p=38}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Missionaries have done a lot of good work because it was through the missionary that many of the Kikuyu got their first education&nbsp;... and were able to learn how to read and write&nbsp;...

They upset the life of the people.|source=\u2014 Kenyatta, in a BBC interview, 1963{{sfn|Archer|1969|p=32}} }}\n\nIn November 1909, Kenyatta left home and enrolled as a pupil at the [[Church of Scotland]] Mission (CSM) at [[Thogoto]].{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|pp=40, 43}} The missionaries were zealous Christians who believed that bringing [[Christianity]] to the indigenous peoples of Eastern Africa was part of Britain's civilising mission.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=46}} While there, Kenyatta stayed at the small [[boarding school]], where he learnt stories from the [[Bible]],{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=45}} and was taught to read and write in [[English language|English]].{{sfnm|1a1=Archer|1y=1969|1p=28|2a1=Murray-Brown|2y=1974|2p=45}} He also performed chores for the mission, including washing the dishes and weeding the gardens.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=43}} He was soon joined at the mission dormitory by his brother Kongo.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=50}} The longer the pupils stayed, the more they came to resent the patronising way many of the British missionaries treated them.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=49}}\n\nKenyatta's academic progress was unremarkable, and in July 1912 he became an apprentice to the mission's carpenter.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=48}} That year, he professed his dedication to Christianity and began undergoing [[catechism]].{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=48}} In 1913, he underwent the Kikuyu [[circumcision]] ritual; the missionaries generally disapproved of this custom, but it was an important aspect of Kikuyu tradition, allowing Kenyatta to be recognised as an adult.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=39}} Asked to take a [[Christian name]] for his upcoming baptism, he first chose both John and Peter after [[Apostles|Jesus' apostles]]. Forced by the missionaries to choose just one, he chose Johnstone, the ''-stone'' chosen as a reference to Peter.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=52}} Accordingly, he was [[Baptism|baptised]] as Johnstone Kamau in August 1914.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=52|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=39}} After his baptism, Kenyatta moved out of the mission dormitory and lived with friends.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=53}} Having completed his apprenticeship to the carpenter, Kenyatta requested that the mission allow him to be an apprentice stonemason, but they refused.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=53}} He then requested that the mission recommend him for employment, but the head missionary refused because of an allegation of minor dishonesty.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=71}}\n\n===Nairobi: 1914\u20131922===\n\nKenyatta moved to [[Thika]], where he worked for an engineering firm run by Briton John Cook. In this position, he was tasked with fetching the company wages from a bank in Nairobi, 25 miles away.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=71|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2pp=40\u201341}} Kenyatta left the job when he became seriously ill; he recuperated at a friend's house in the Tumutumu Presbyterian mission.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1pp=71\u201372|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=41}} At the time, the [[British Empire]] was engaged in the [[First World War]], and the [[British Army]] had recruited many Kikuyu. One of those who joined was Kongo, who disappeared during the conflict; his family never learned of his fate.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=73}} Kenyatta did not join the armed forces, and like other Kikuyu he moved to live among the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], who had refused to fight for the British.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=73|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=41}} Kenyatta lived with the family of an aunt who had married a Maasai chief,{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=74}} adopting Maasai customs and wearing Maasai jewellery, including a beaded belt known as ''kinyata'' in the [[Kikuyu language]]. At some point, he took to calling himself \"Kinyata\" or \"Kenyatta\" after this garment.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=75}}\n\nIn 1917, Kenyatta moved to [[Narok]], where he was involved in transporting livestock to Nairobi,{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=74}} before relocating to Nairobi to work in a store selling farming and engineering equipment.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=74}} In the evenings, he took classes in a church mission school.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=74}} Several months later he returned to Thika before obtaining employment building houses for the Thogota Mission.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|pp=74\u201375}} He also lived for a time in [[Dagoretti]], where he became a retainer for a local sub-chief, Kioi; in 1919 he assisted Kioi in putting the latter's case in a land dispute before a Nairobi court.{{sfnm|1a1=Archer|1y=1969|1pp=38\u201339|2a1=Murray-Brown|2y=1974|2pp=79, 80}} Desiring a wife,{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=79}} Kenyatta entered a relationship with [[Grace Wahu]], who had attended the CMS School in [[Kabete]]; she initially moved into Kenyatta's family homestead,{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=79}} although she joined Kenyatta in Dagoretti when Ngengi drove her out.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=79}} On 20 November 1920 she gave birth to Kenyatta's son, Peter Muigui.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1pp=79, 96|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=42}} In October 1920, Kenyatta was called before the Thogota Kirk Session and suspended from taking [[Holy Communion]]; the suspension was in response to his drinking and his relations with Wahu out of wedlock.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=91|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=42}} The church insisted that a traditional Kikuyu wedding would be inadequate, and that he must undergo a Christian marriage;{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=92}} this took place on 8&nbsp;November 1922.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=93}} Kenyatta had initially refused to cease drinking,{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=92}} but in July 1923 officially renounced alcohol and was allowed to return to Holy Communion.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nIn April 1922, Kenyatta began working as a stores clerk and meter reader for Cook, who had been appointed water superintendent for Nairobi's municipal council.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1pp=94\u201395|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=42}} He earned 250 [[East African shilling|shillings]] a month, a particularly high wage for a native African, which brought him financial independence and a growing sense of self-confidence.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|pp=94, 95}} Kenyatta lived in the [[Kilimani]] neighbourhood of Nairobi,{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=95}} although financed the construction of a second home at Dagoretti; he referred to this latter hut as the Kinyata Stores for he used it to hold general provisions for the neighbourhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1pp=95, 96|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=42}} He had sufficient funds that he could lend money to European clerks in the offices,{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=96}} and could enjoy the lifestyle offered by Nairobi, which included cinemas, football matches, and imported British fashions.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=96}}\n\n===Kikuyu Central Association: 1922\u20131929===\n\n[[File:Edward Grigg.jpg|thumb|right|Kenyatta lobbied against many of the actions of Edward Grigg, Governor of Kenya; in turn, Grigg tried to suppress many of Kenyatta's activities.]]\n\n[[Anti-imperialism|Anti-imperialist]] sentiment was on the rise among both native and Indian communities in Kenya following the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the Russian [[October Revolution]].{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=103}} Many indigenous Africans resented having to carry ''[[kipande]]'' identity certificates at all times, being forbidden from growing coffee, and paying taxes without political representation.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|pp=18\u201319}} Political upheavals occurred in Kikuyuland\u2014the area inhabited largely by the Kikuyu\u2014following World War I, among them the campaigns of [[Harry Thuku]] and the [[East African Association]], resulting in the government massacre of 21 native protesters in March 1922.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=90|2a1=Arnold|2y=1974|2pp=19\u201320}} Kenyatta had not taken part in these events,{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=90}} perhaps so as not to disrupt his lucrative employment prospects.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=95}}\n\nKenyatta's interest in politics stemmed from his friendship with [[James Beauttah]], a senior figure in the [[Kikuyu Central Association]] (KCA). Beauttah took Kenyatta to a political meeting in [[Pumwani]], although this led to no firm involvement at the time.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=101}} In either 1925 or early 1926, Beauttah moved to Uganda, although remained in contact with Kenyatta.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=103}} When the KCA wrote to Beauttah and asked him to travel to [[London]] as their representative, he declined, but recommended that Kenyatta\u2014who had a good command of English\u2014go in his place.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=105}} Kenyatta accepted, probably on the condition that the Association matched his pre-existing wage.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=106}} He thus became the group's secretary.{{sfn|Assensoh|1998|pp=42\u201343}}\n\nIt is likely that the KCA purchased a motorbike for Kenyatta,{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=106}} which he used to travel around Kikuyuland and neighbouring areas inhabited by the [[Meru people|Meru]] and [[Embu people|Embu]], helping to establish new KCA branches.{{sfnm|1a1=Archer|1y=1969|1pp=43, 46|2a1=Murray-Brown|2y=1974|2p=110}} In February 1928, he was part of a KCA party that visited Government House in Nairobi to give evidence in front of the [[Hilton Young Commission]], which was then considering a federation between Kenya, Uganda, and [[Tanganyika]].{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|pp=105, 106}} In June, he was part of a KCA team which appeared before a [[select committee]] of the [[Legislative Council of Kenya|Kenyan Legislative Council]] to express concerns about the recent introduction of Land Boards.

agriculture dominated while industry was limited, and there was a heavy reliance on exporting primary goods while importing capital and manufactured goods.{{sfn|Ochieng|1995|p=83}} Under Kenyatta, the structure of this economy did not fundamentally change, remaining externally oriented and dominated by [[multinational corporation]]s and foreign capital.{{sfn|Ochieng|1995|pp=90, 91}} Kenyatta's economic policy was [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[entrepreneurial]],{{sfnm|1a1=Arnold|1y=1974|1p=84|2a1=Maxon|2y=1995|2p=115|3a1=Maloba|3y=2017|3p=6}} with no serious socialist policies being pursued;{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=208}} its focus was on achieving [[economic growth]] as opposed to equitable redistribution.{{sfn|Ochieng|1995|p=85}} The government passed laws to encourage foreign investment, recognising that Kenya needed foreign-trained specialists in scientific and technical fields to aid its economic development.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|pp=157\u2013158}} Under Kenyatta, Western companies regarded Kenya as a safe and profitable place for investment;{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=177}} between 1964 and 1970, large-scale foreign investment and industry in Kenya nearly doubled.{{sfn|Ochieng|1995|p=85}}\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM President Jomo Kenyatta kijkt toe bij de keuring van stamboekvee tijdens de Eldoret Agricultural Show TMnr 20038663.jpg|thumb|left|Kenyatta at an agricultural show in 1968]]\n\nIn contrast to his economic policies, Kenyatta publicly claimed he would create a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] state with an equitable distribution of economic and social development.{{sfn|Ochieng|1995|p=91}} In 1965, when [[Thomas Mboya]] was minister for economic planning and development, the government issued a [[session paper]] titled \"African Socialism and its Application to Planning in Kenya\", in which it officially declared its commitment to what it called an \"[[African socialism|African socialist]]\" economic model.{{sfnm|1a1=Ochieng|1y=1995|1p=83|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=64|3a1=Maloba|3y=2017|3p=77}} The session proposed a [[mixed economy]] with an important role for private capital,{{sfnm|1a1=Savage|1y=1970|1p=520|2a1=Ochieng|2y=1995|2p=84}} with Kenyatta's government specifying that it would consider only [[nationalisation]] in instances where national security was at risk.{{sfnm|1a1=Ochieng|1y=1995|1p=84|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=64}} Left-wing critics highlighted that the image of \"African socialism\" portrayed in the document provided for no major shift away from the colonial economy.{{sfn|Ochieng|1995|p=96}}\n\nKenya's agricultural and industrial sectors were dominated by Europeans and its commerce and trade by Asians; one of Kenyatta's most pressing issues was to bring the economy under indigenous control.{{sfn|Ochieng|1995|p=85}} There was growing black resentment towards the Asian domination of the small business sector,{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=171}} with Kenyatta's government putting pressure on Asian-owned businesses, intending to replace them with African-owned counterparts.{{sfn|Savage|1970|p=521}} The 1965 session paper promised an \"Africanization\" of the Kenyan economy,{{sfn|Assensoh|1998|pp=64\u201365}} with the government increasingly pushing for \"black capitalism\".{{sfn|Savage|1970|p=521}} The government established the [[Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation]] to provide loans for black-owned businesses,{{sfn|Savage|1970|p=521}} and secured a 51% share in the [[Kenya National Assurance Company]].{{sfn|Savage|1970|p=522}} In 1965, the government established the [[Kenya National Trading Corporation]] to ensure indigenous control over the trade in essential commodities,{{sfn|Assensoh|1998|p=64}} while the Trade Licensing Act of 1967 prohibited non-citizens from involvement in the rice, sugar, and maize trade.{{sfnm|1a1=Savage|1y=1970|1p=521|2a1=Ochieng|2y=1995|2p=85|3a1=Maxon|3y=1995|3p=114|4a1=Assensoh|4y=1998|4p=64}} During the 1970s, this expanded to cover the trade in soap, cement, and textiles.{{sfn|Assensoh|1998|p=64}} Many Asians who had retained British citizenship were affected by these measures.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=316|2a1=Arnold|2y=1974|2p=170}} Between late 1967 and early 1968, growing numbers of Kenyan Asians migrated to Britain;{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=114}} in February 1968 large numbers migrated quickly before [[Immigration Act 1971|a legal change revoked their right to do so]].{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=172}} Kenyatta was not sympathetic to those leaving: \"Kenya's identity as an African country is not going to be altered by the whims and malaises of groups of uncommitted individuals.\"{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=172}}\n\nUnder Kenyatta, corruption became widespread throughout the government, civil service, and business community.{{sfn|Maloba|2017|pp=215\u2013216}} Kenyatta and his family were tied up with this corruption as they enriched themselves through the mass purchase of property after 1963.{{sfn|Maloba|2017|pp=236\u2013237}} Their acquisitions in the Central, Rift Valley, and Coast Provinces aroused great anger among landless Kenyans.{{sfn|Maloba|2017|p=241}} His family used his presidential position to circumvent legal or administrative obstacles to acquiring property.{{sfn|Maloba|2017|p=238}} The Kenyatta family also heavily invested in the coastal hotel business, Kenyatta personally owning the Leonard Beach Hotel.{{sfn|Maloba|2017|p=242}} Other businesses they were involved with included ruby mining in [[Tsavo East National Park|Tsavo National Park]], the casino business, the charcoal trade\u2014which was causing significant deforestation\u2014and the ivory trade.{{sfn|Maloba|2017|pp=242\u2013244}} The Kenyan press, which was largely loyal to Kenyatta, did not delve into this issue;{{sfn|Maloba|2017|p=236}} it was only after his death that publications appeared revealing the scale of his personal enrichment.{{sfn|Maloba|2017|pp=237\u2013238}} Kenyan corruption and Kenyatta's role in it was better known in Britain, although many of his British friends\u2014including McDonald and Brockway\u2014chose to believe Kenyatta was not personally involved.{{sfn|Maloba|2017|pp=246\u2013247, 249}}\n\n====Land, healthcare, and education reform====\n\n[[File:Dr Banda of Malawi and Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya.jpg|thumb|right|Kenyatta with Malawian President [[Hastings Banda]]]]\n\nThe question of land ownership had deep emotional resonance in Kenya, having been a major grievance against the British colonialists.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=195}} As part of the Lancaster House negotiations, Britain's government agreed to provide Kenya with \u00a327 million with which to buy out white farmers and redistribute their land among the indigenous population.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=196}} To ease this transition, Kenyatta made McKenzie, a white farmer, the Minister of Agriculture and Land.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=196}} Kenyatta's government encouraged the establishment of private land-buying companies that were often headed by prominent politicians.{{sfn|Boone|2012|p=81}} The government sold or leased lands in the former White Highlands to these companies, which in turn subdivided them among individual shareholders.{{sfn|Boone|2012|p=81}} In this way, the land redistribution programs favoured the ruling party's chief constituency.{{sfn|Boone|2012|p=82}} Kenyatta himself expanded the land that he owned around Gatundu.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=316}} Kenyans who made claims to land on the basis of ancestral ownership often found the land given to other people, including Kenyans from different parts of the country.{{sfn|Boone|2012|p=82}} Voices began to condemn the redistribution; in 1969, the MP [[Jean-Marie Seroney]] censured the sale of historically [[Nandi people|Nandi]] lands in the Rift to non-Nandi, describing the settlement schemes as \"Kenyatta's colonization of the rift\".{{sfnm|1a1=Boone|1y=2012|1p=85|2a1=Maloba|2y=2017|2p=251}}\n\nIn part fuelled by high rural unemployment, Kenya witnessed growing rural-to-urban migration under Kenyatta's government.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|pp=124\u2013125}} This exacerbated urban unemployment and housing shortages, with squatter settlements and slums growing up and urban crime rates rising.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|pp=125\u2013126}} Kenyatta was concerned by this, and promoted the reversal of this rural-to-urban migration, but in this was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=126}} Kenyatta's government was eager to control the country's trade unions, fearing their ability to disrupt the economy.{{sfn|Savage|1970|p=522}} To this end it emphasised social welfare schemes over traditional industrial institutions,{{sfn|Savage|1970|p=522}} and in 1965 transformed the Kenya Federation of Labour into the Central Organization of Trade (COT), a body which came under strong government influence.{{sfnm|1a1=Savage|1y=1970|1p=523|2a1=Maloba|2y=2017|2p=91}} No strikes could be legally carried out in Kenya without COT's permission.{{sfn|Savage|1970|p=523}} There were also measures to Africanise the civil service, which by mid-1967 had become 91% African.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=113}} During the 1960s and 1970s the [[public sector]] grew faster than the private sector.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=118}} The growth in the public sector contributed to the significant expansion of the indigenous [[middle class]] in Kenyatta's Kenya.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=120}}\n\n[[File:Universityofnairobi.jpg|thumb|left|The University of Nairobi, Kenya's first institution of higher education, was established under Kenyatta's administration.]]\n\nThe government oversaw a massive expansion in education facilities.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=110}} In June 1963, Kenyatta ordered the Ominda Commission to determine a framework for meeting Kenya's educational needs.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|pp=126\u2013127}} Their report set out the long-term goal of universal free primary education in Kenya but argued that the government's emphasis should be on secondary and higher education to facilitate the training of indigenous African personnel to take over the civil service and other jobs requiring such an education.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=127}} Between 1964 and 1966, the number of primary schools grew by 11.6%, and the number of secondary schools by 80%.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=127}} By the time of Kenyatta's death, Kenya's first universities\u2014the [[University of Nairobi]] and [[Kenyatta University]]\u2014had been established.{{sfnm|1a1=Maxon|1y=1995|1p=127|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=147}} Although Kenyatta died without having attained the goal of free, universal primary education in Kenya, the country had made significant advances in that direction, with 85% of Kenyan children in primary education, and within a decade of independence had trained sufficient numbers of indigenous Africans to take over the civil service.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=128}}\n\nAnother priority for Kenyatta's government was improving access to healthcare services.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=132}} It stated that its long-term goal was to establish a system of free, universal medical care.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=133}} In the short-term, its emphasis was on increasing the overall number of doctors and registered nurses while decreasing the number of expatriates in those positions.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=132}} In 1965, the government introduced free medical services for out-patients and children.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=133}} By Kenyatta's death, the majority of Kenyans had access to significantly better healthcare than they had had in the colonial period.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=133}} Before independence, the average life expectancy in Kenya was 45, but by the end of the 1970s it was 55, the second highest in Sub-Saharan Africa.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=134}} This improved medical care had resulted in declining mortality rates while birth rates remained high, resulting in a rapidly growing population; from 1962 to 1979, Kenya's population grew by just under 4% a year, the highest rate in the world at the time.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=122}} This put a severe strain on social services; Kenyatta's government promoted [[family planning]] projects to stem the birth-rate, but these had little success.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\n====Foreign policy====\n\n[[File:Roy Innis, Jomo Kenyatta, Doris Funnye Innis in Kenya Circa 1970.jpg|thumb|right|Kenyatta meets an American delegation from the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], including [[Roy Innis]].]]\n\nIn part due to his advanced years, Kenyatta rarely travelled outside of Eastern Africa.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=167}} Under Kenyatta, Kenya was largely uninvolved in the affairs of other states, including those in the [[East African Community]].{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=320}} Despite his reservations about any immediate East African Federation, in June 1967 Kenyatta signed the [[Treaty for East African Co-operation]].{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=175}} In December he attended a meeting with Tanzanian and Ugandan representatives to form the [[East African Economic Community]], reflecting Kenyatta's cautious approach toward regional integration.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=175}} He also took on a mediating role during the [[Congo Crisis]], heading the [[Organisation of African Unity]]'s Conciliation Commission on the Congo.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=178}}\n\nFacing the pressures of the [[Cold War]],{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=188}} Kenyatta officially pursued a policy of \"positive non-alignment\".{{sfn|Cullen|2016|p=515}} In reality, his foreign policy was pro-Western and in particular pro-British.{{sfnm|1a1=Cullen|1y=2016|1p=515|2a1=Maloba|2y=2017|2p=96}} Kenya became a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]],{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=313}} using this as a vehicle to put pressure on the white-minority [[apartheid]] regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|pp=167\u2013168}} Britain remained one of Kenya's foremost sources of foreign trade; British aid to Kenya was among the highest in Africa.{{sfn|Cullen|2016|p=515}} In 1964, Kenya and the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding, one of only two military alliances Kenyatta's government made;{{sfn|Cullen|2016|p=515}} the British [[Special Air Service]] trained Kenyatta's own bodyguards.{{sfn|Maloba|2017|p=54}} Commentators argued that Britain's relationship with Kenyatta's Kenya was a [[Neo-colonialism|neo-colonial]] one, with the British having exchanged their position of political power for one of influence.{{sfn|Cullen|2016|p=514}} The historian Poppy Cullen nevertheless noted that there was no \"dictatorial neo-colonial control\" in Kenyatta's Kenya.{{sfn|Cullen|2016|p=515}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F021917-0014, Kenia, Staatsbesuch Bundespr\u00e4sident L\u00fcbke.jpg|thumb|left|Jomo Kenyatta and his son meeting the [[President of Germany|President of West Germany]] [[Heinrich L\u00fcbke]] in 1966.]]\n\nAlthough many white Kenyans accepted Kenyatta's rule, he remained opposed by white [[far right politics|far right]] activists;

He suggested that the British supported Kenyatta in this, seeing him as a bulwark against growing worker and peasant militancy who would ensure continued neo-colonial dominance.{{sfn|O'Brien|1976|pp=92\u201393}}\n\nProviding a similar leftist critique, the Marxist writer Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o stated that \"here was a black Moses who had been called by history to lead his people to the promised land of no exploitation, no oppression, but who failed to rise to the occasion\".{{sfn|Maloba|2017|p=354}} Ng\u0169g\u0129 saw Kenyatta as a \"twentieth-century tragic figure: he could have been a Lenin, a Mao Tse-Tung, or a Ho Chi Minh; but he ended up being a Chiang Kai-Shek, a Park-Chung Hee, or a Pinochet.\"{{sfn|Maloba|2017|p=355}} Ng\u0169g\u0129 was among Kenyan critics who claimed that Kenyatta treated Mau Mau veterans dismissively, leaving many of them impoverished and landless while seeking to remove them from the centre stage of national politics.{{sfn|Maloba|2017|pp=350\u2013351, 353}} In other areas Kenyatta's government also faced criticism; it for instance made little progress in advancing women's rights in Kenya.{{sfn|Assensoh|1998|p=65}}\n\nAssensoh argued that in his life story, Kenyatta had a great deal in common with Ghana's Nkrumah.{{sfn|Assensoh|1998|p=3}} Simon Gikandi noted that Kenyatta, like Nkrumah, was remembered for \"initiating the discourse and process that plotted the narrative of African freedom\", but at the same time both were \"often remembered for their careless institution of presidential rule, one party dictatorship, ethnicity and cronyism. They are remembered both for making the dream of African independence a reality and for their invention of postcolonial authoritarianism.\"{{sfn|Gikandi|2000|p=4}}\nIn 1991, the Kenyan lawyer and human rights activist Gibson Kamau Kuria noted that in abolishing the federal system, banning independent candidates from standing in elections, setting up a unicameral legislature, and relaxing restrictions on the use of emergency powers, Kenyatta had laid \"the groundwork\" for Moi to further advance dictatorial power in Kenya during the late 1970s and 1980s.{{sfn|Kuria|1991|pp=120\u201321}}\n\nKenyatta was accused by Kenya's Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission in its 2013 report of using his authority as President to allocate large tracts of land to himself and his family across Kenya.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/news/politics/Kenyatta-led-elite-in-land-grabbing-/1064-1859262-7fe9vsz/index.html|title=Kenyatta Led Elite in Land Grabbing |date=11 May 2013|website=[[Daily Nation]]|access-date=12 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810111856/https://www.nation.co.ke/news/politics/Kenyatta-led-elite-in-land-grabbing-/1064-1859262-7fe9vsz/index.html|archive-date=10 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Kenyatta family is among Kenya's biggest landowners.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Kenyatta-family-s-multi-billion-shilling-dream-city-takes-off/539546-3040862-tbxmtbz/index.html|title=Kenyatta Family Seeks Approval To For Its Dream City Outside Nairobi |first=Kiarie |last=Njoroge |date=20 January 2016 |work=Business Daily |access-date=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110165633/https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Kenyatta-family-s-multi-billion-shilling-dream-city-takes-off/539546-3040862-tbxmtbz/index.html|archive-date=10 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> \nDuring the 1990s, there was still much frustration among tribal groups, namely in the Nandi, Nakuru, Uasin-Gishu, and Trans-Nzoia Districts, that under Kenyatta's government they had not regained the lands taken by European settlers and that more of their land had been sold to those regarded as \"foreigners\"\u2014Kenyans from other tribes.{{sfn|Boone|2012|p=86}} Among these groups there were widespread calls for restitution and in 1991 and 1992 there were violent attacks against many of those who obtained land through Kenyatta's patronage in these areas.

He was the country's first indigenous head of government and played a significant role in the transformation of Kenya from [[Kenya Colony|a colony]] of the [[British Empire]] into an independent republic. Ideologically an [[African nationalist]] and [[conservative]], he led the [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) party from 1961 until his death.\n\n<!--Early life, childhood through to imprisonment-->\nKenyatta was born to [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] farmers in [[Kiambu]], [[British East Africa]]. Educated at a [[mission school]], he worked in various jobs before becoming politically engaged through the [[Kikuyu Central Association]]. In 1929, he travelled to London to lobby for Kikuyu land affairs. During the 1930s, he studied at Moscow's [[Communist University of the Toilers of the East]], [[University College London]], and the [[London School of Economics]]. In 1938, he published [[Facing Mount Kenya|an anthropological study of Kikuyu life]] before working as a farm labourer in [[Sussex]] during the [[Second World War]]. Influenced by his friend [[George Padmore]], he embraced anti-colonialist and [[Pan-African]] ideas, co-organising the 1945 [[Pan-African Congress]] in [[Manchester]]. He returned to Kenya in 1946 and became a school principal. In 1947, he was elected President of the [[Kenya African Union]], through which he lobbied for independence from British colonial rule, attracting widespread indigenous support but animosity from [[White Kenyans|white settlers]]. In 1952, he was among the [[Kapenguria Six]] arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial [[Mau Mau Uprising]]. Although protesting his innocence\u2014a view shared by later historians\u2014he was convicted. He remained imprisoned at [[Lokitaung]] until 1959 and then exiled in [[Lodwar]] until 1961.\n\n<!--Later life; premiership and presidency-->\nOn his release, Kenyatta became President of KANU and led the party to victory in the [[1963 Kenyan general election|1963 general election]]. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the transition of the [[Kenya Colony]] into an independent republic, of which he became President in 1964. Desiring a [[one-party state]], he transferred regional powers to his central government, suppressed political dissent, and prohibited KANU's only rival\u2014[[Jaramogi Oginga Odinga|Oginga Odinga]]'s leftist [[Kenya People's Union]]\u2014from competing in elections. He promoted reconciliation between the country's indigenous ethnic groups and its European minority, although his relations with the [[Indians in Kenya|Kenyan Indians]] were strained and Kenya's army clashed with [[Somali-Kenyan conflict|Somali separatists]] in the [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]] during the [[Shifta War]]. His government pursued [[capitalist]] economic policies and the \"Africanisation\" of the economy, prohibiting non-citizens from controlling key industries. Education and healthcare were expanded, while UK-funded land redistribution favoured KANU loyalists and exacerbated ethnic tensions. Under Kenyatta, Kenya joined the [[Organisation of African Unity]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], espousing a pro-[[Western world|Western]] and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] foreign policy amid the [[Cold War]]. Kenyatta died in office and was succeeded by [[Daniel arap Moi]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nKenyatta was a controversial figure. Prior to Kenyan independence, many of its white settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, he was given the honorary title of '''Mzee''' and lauded as the [[Father of the Nation]], securing support from both the black majority and the white minority with his message of reconciliation. Conversely, his rule was criticised as dictatorial, [[authoritarian]], and [[neo-colonialism|neo-colonial]], of favouring Kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of facilitating the growth of widespread [[Corruption in Kenya|corruption]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: c.1890\u20131914===\n\n[[File:Kikuyu village 02.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Kikuyu house similar to that in which Kenyatta would have lived in Nginda.]]\n\nA member of the [[Kikuyu people]], Kenyatta was born in the village of Nginda.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=34|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=38}} Birth records were not then kept among the Kikuyu, and Kenyatta's date of birth is not known.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=33|2a1=Arnold|2y=1974|2p=11|3a1=Assensoh|3y=1998|3p=38}} One biographer, Jules Archer, suggested he was likely born in 1890,{{sfn|Archer|1969|p=11}} although a fuller analysis by Jeremy Murray-Brown suggested a birth ''circa'' 1897 or 1898.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=323}} Kenyatta's father was named Muigai, and his mother Wambui.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=34|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=38}} They lived in a homestead near the [[River Thiririka]], where they raised crops and bred sheep and goats.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=34|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=38}} Muigai was sufficiently wealthy that he could afford to keep several wives, each living in a separate ''ny\u016bmba'' (woman's hut).{{sfn|Archer|1969|pp=11, 14\u201315}}\n\nKenyatta was raised according to traditional Kikuyu custom and belief, and was taught the skills needed to herd the family flock.{{sfnm|1a1=Archer|1y=1969|1pp=13\u201314, 16|2a1=Murray-Brown|2y=1974|2pp=35\u201336}} When he was ten, his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition from childhood.{{sfn|Archer|1969|p=17}} Wambui subsequently bore another son, Kongo,{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=35}} shortly before Muigai died.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=37}} In keeping with Kikuyu tradition, Wambui then married her late husband's younger brother, Ngengi.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=37}} Kenyatta then took the name of Kamau wa Ngengi (\"Kamau, son of Ngengi\").{{sfnm|1a1=Archer|1y=1969|1p=11|2a1=Murray-Brown|2y=1974|2p=42|3a1=Arnold|3y=1974|3p=15}} Wambui bore her new husband a son, whom they also named Muigai.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=37}} Ngengi was harsh and resentful toward the three boys, and Wambui decided to take her youngest son to live with her parental family further north.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=37}} It was there that she died, and Kenyatta\u2014who was very fond of the younger Muigai\u2014travelled to collect his infant half-brother.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=37}} Kenyatta then moved in with his grandfather, Kongo wa Magana, and assisted the latter in his role as a [[Traditional medicine|traditional healer]].{{sfnm|1a1=Archer|1y=1969|1p=18|2a1=Murray-Brown|2y=1974|2p=38}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Missionaries have done a lot of good work because it was through the missionary that many of the Kikuyu got their first education&nbsp;... and were able to learn how to read and write&nbsp;...

They upset the life of the people.|source=\u2014 Kenyatta, in a BBC interview, 1963{{sfn|Archer|1969|p=32}} }}\n\nIn November 1909, Kenyatta left home and enrolled as a pupil at the [[Church of Scotland]] Mission (CSM) at [[Thogoto]].{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|pp=40, 43}} The missionaries were zealous Christians who believed that bringing [[Christianity]] to the indigenous peoples of Eastern Africa was part of Britain's civilising mission.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=46}} While there, Kenyatta stayed at the small [[boarding school]], where he learnt stories from the [[Bible]],{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=45}} and was taught to read and write in [[English language|English]].{{sfnm|1a1=Archer|1y=1969|1p=28|2a1=Murray-Brown|2y=1974|2p=45}} He also performed chores for the mission, including washing the dishes and weeding the gardens.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=43}} He was soon joined at the mission dormitory by his brother Kongo.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=50}} The longer the pupils stayed, the more they came to resent the patronising way many of the British missionaries treated them.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=49}}\n\nKenyatta's academic progress was unremarkable, and in July 1912 he became an apprentice to the mission's carpenter.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=48}} That year, he professed his dedication to Christianity and began undergoing [[catechism]].{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=48}} In 1913, he underwent the Kikuyu [[circumcision]] ritual; the missionaries generally disapproved of this custom, but it was an important aspect of Kikuyu tradition, allowing Kenyatta to be recognised as an adult.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=39}} Asked to take a [[Christian name]] for his upcoming baptism, he first chose both John and Peter after [[Apostles|Jesus' apostles]]. Forced by the missionaries to choose just one, he chose Johnstone, the ''-stone'' chosen as a reference to Peter.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=52}} Accordingly, he was [[Baptism|baptised]] as Johnstone Kamau in August 1914.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray-Brown|1y=1974|1p=52|2a1=Assensoh|2y=1998|2p=39}} After his baptism, Kenyatta moved out of the mission dormitory and lived with friends.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=53}} Having completed his apprenticeship to the carpenter, Kenyatta requested that the mission allow him to be an apprentice stonemason, but they refused.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=53}} He then requested that the mission recommend him for employment, but the head missionary refused because of an allegation of minor dishonesty.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=71}}\n\n===Nairobi: 1914\u20131922===\n\nKenyatta moved to [[Thika]], where he worked for an engineering firm run by Briton John Cook.

In 1962, the white minority had produced 80% of the country's exports and were a vital part of its economy, yet between 1962 and 1963 they were emigrating at a rate of 700 a month; Kenyatta feared that this white exodus would cause a [[brain drain]] and [[Labour shortage|skills shortage]] that would be detrimental to the economy.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=66}} He was also aware that the confidence of the white minority would be crucial to securing Western investment in Kenya's economy.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=309}} Kenyatta made it clear that when in power, he would not sack any white civil servants unless there were competent black individuals capable of replacing them.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=187}} He was sufficiently successful that several prominent white Kenyans backed KANU in the subsequent election.{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=308}}\n\nIn 1962 he returned to London to attend one of the Lancaster House conferences.{{sfnm|1a1=Arnold|1y=1974|1p=159|2a1=Kyle|2y=1997|2p=55}} There, KANU and KADU representatives met with British officials to formulate a new constitution.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=152}} KADU desired a federalist state organised on a system they called ''[[Majimbo]]'' with six largely autonomous regional authorities, a two-chamber legislature, and a central Federal Council of Ministers who would select a rotating chair to serve as head of government for a one-year term.

from 1962 to 1979, Kenya's population grew by just under 4% a year, the highest rate in the world at the time.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|p=122}} This put a severe strain on social services; Kenyatta's government promoted [[family planning]] projects to stem the birth-rate, but these had little success.{{sfn|Maxon|1995|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\n====Foreign policy====\n\n[[File:Roy Innis, Jomo Kenyatta, Doris Funnye Innis in Kenya Circa 1970.jpg|thumb|right|Kenyatta meets an American delegation from the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], including [[Roy Innis]].]]\n\nIn part due to his advanced years, Kenyatta rarely travelled outside of Eastern Africa.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=167}} Under Kenyatta, Kenya was largely uninvolved in the affairs of other states, including those in the [[East African Community]].{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=320}} Despite his reservations about any immediate East African Federation, in June 1967 Kenyatta signed the [[Treaty for East African Co-operation]].{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=175}} In December he attended a meeting with Tanzanian and Ugandan representatives to form the [[East African Economic Community]], reflecting Kenyatta's cautious approach toward regional integration.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=175}} He also took on a mediating role during the [[Congo Crisis]], heading the [[Organisation of African Unity]]'s Conciliation Commission on the Congo.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=178}}\n\nFacing the pressures of the [[Cold War]],{{sfn|Arnold|1974|p=188}} Kenyatta officially pursued a policy of \"positive non-alignment\".{{sfn|Cullen|2016|p=515}} In reality, his foreign policy was pro-Western and in particular pro-British.{{sfnm|1a1=Cullen|1y=2016|1p=515|2a1=Maloba|2y=2017|2p=96}} Kenya became a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]],{{sfn|Murray-Brown|1974|p=313}} using this as a vehicle to put pressure on the white-minority [[apartheid]] regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia.{{sfn|Arnold|1974|pp=167\u2013168}} Britain remained one of Kenya's foremost sources of foreign trade; British aid to Kenya was among the highest in Africa.{{sfn|Cullen|2016|p=515}} In 1964, Kenya and the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding, one of only two military alliances Kenyatta's government made;{{sfn|Cullen|2016|p=515}} the British [[Special Air Service]] trained Kenyatta's own bodyguards.{{sfn|Maloba|2017|p=54}} Commentators argued that Britain's relationship with Kenyatta's Kenya was a [[Neo-colonialism|neo-colonial]] one, with the British having exchanged their position of political power for one of influence.{{sfn|Cullen|2016|p=514}} The historian Poppy Cullen nevertheless noted that there was no \"dictatorial neo-colonial control\" in Kenyatta's Kenya.{{sfn|Cullen|2016|p=515}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F021917-0014, Kenia, Staatsbesuch Bundespr\u00e4sident L\u00fcbke.jpg|thumb|left|Jomo Kenyatta and his son meeting the [[President of Germany|President of West Germany]] [[Heinrich L\u00fcbke]] in 1966.]]\n\nAlthough many white Kenyans accepted Kenyatta's rule, he remained opposed by white [[far right politics|far right]] activists;

He suggested that the British supported Kenyatta in this, seeing him as a bulwark against growing worker and peasant militancy who would ensure continued neo-colonial dominance.{{sfn|O'Brien|1976|pp=92\u201393}}\n\nProviding a similar leftist critique, the Marxist writer Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o stated that \"here was a black Moses who had been called by history to lead his people to the promised land of no exploitation, no oppression, but who failed to rise to the occasion\".{{sfn|Maloba|2017|p=354}} Ng\u0169g\u0129 saw Kenyatta as a \"twentieth-century tragic figure: he could have been a Lenin, a Mao Tse-Tung, or a Ho Chi Minh; but he ended up being a Chiang Kai-Shek, a Park-Chung Hee, or a Pinochet.\"{{sfn|Maloba|2017|p=355}} Ng\u0169g\u0129 was among Kenyan critics who claimed that Kenyatta treated Mau Mau veterans dismissively, leaving many of them impoverished and landless while seeking to remove them from the centre stage of national politics.{{sfn|Maloba|2017|pp=350\u2013351, 353}} In other areas Kenyatta's government also faced criticism; it for instance made little progress in advancing women's rights in Kenya.{{sfn|Assensoh|1998|p=65}}\n\nAssensoh argued that in his life story, Kenyatta had a great deal in common with Ghana's Nkrumah.{{sfn|Assensoh|1998|p=3}} Simon Gikandi noted that Kenyatta, like Nkrumah, was remembered for \"initiating the discourse and process that plotted the narrative of African freedom\", but at the same time both were \"often remembered for their careless institution of presidential rule, one party dictatorship, ethnicity and cronyism. They are remembered both for making the dream of African independence a reality and for their invention of postcolonial authoritarianism.\"{{sfn|Gikandi|2000|p=4}}\nIn 1991, the Kenyan lawyer and human rights activist Gibson Kamau Kuria noted that in abolishing the federal system, banning independent candidates from standing in elections, setting up a unicameral legislature, and relaxing restrictions on the use of emergency powers, Kenyatta had laid \"the groundwork\" for Moi to further advance dictatorial power in Kenya during the late 1970s and 1980s.{{sfn|Kuria|1991|pp=120\u201321}}\n\nKenyatta was accused by Kenya's Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission in its 2013 report of using his authority as President to allocate large tracts of land to himself and his family across Kenya.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/news/politics/Kenyatta-led-elite-in-land-grabbing-/1064-1859262-7fe9vsz/index.html|title=Kenyatta Led Elite in Land Grabbing |date=11 May 2013|website=[[Daily Nation]]|access-date=12 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810111856/https://www.nation.co.ke/news/politics/Kenyatta-led-elite-in-land-grabbing-/1064-1859262-7fe9vsz/index.html|archive-date=10 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Kenyatta family is among Kenya's biggest landowners.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Kenyatta-family-s-multi-billion-shilling-dream-city-takes-off/539546-3040862-tbxmtbz/index.html|title=Kenyatta Family Seeks Approval To For Its Dream City Outside Nairobi |first=Kiarie |last=Njoroge |date=20 January 2016 |work=Business Daily |access-date=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110165633/https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Kenyatta-family-s-multi-billion-shilling-dream-city-takes-off/539546-3040862-tbxmtbz/index.html|archive-date=10 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> \nDuring the 1990s, there was still much frustration among tribal groups, namely in the Nandi, Nakuru, Uasin-Gishu, and Trans-Nzoia Districts, that under Kenyatta's government they had not regained the lands taken by European settlers and that more of their land had been sold to those regarded as \"foreigners\"\u2014Kenyans from other tribes.{{sfn|Boone|2012|p=86}} Among these groups there were widespread calls for restitution and in 1991 and 1992 there were violent attacks against many of those who obtained land through Kenyatta's patronage in these areas.

The islands are administratively part of [[Krabi Province]]. [[Ko Phi Phi Don]] ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e19}}; {{rtgs|''ko phiphi don''}}) (''ko'' {{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30}} 'island') is the largest and most populated island of the group, although the beaches of the second largest island, [[Ko Phi Phi Le]] ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e40\u0e25}}; {{rtgs|''ko phiphi le''}}) are visited by many people as well. The rest of the islands in the group, including Bida Nok, Bida Nai, and Bamboo Island ([[Ko Mai Phai]]), are not much more than large limestone rocks jutting out of the sea. The islands are reachable by speedboats or [[long-tail boat]]s most often from [[Krabi]] town or from piers in [[Phuket Province]].\n\nPhi Phi Don was initially populated by [[Muslim]] fishermen during the late-1940s, and later became a coconut plantation. The resident Thai population of Phi Phi Don remains more than 80 percent Muslim. The current population however\u2014if counting transient workers\u2014is more Buddhist than Muslim. The resident population is between 2,000 and 3,000 people (2013).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe islands came to worldwide prominence when Ko Phi Phi Le was used as a location for the 2000 [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.<ref name=Vox-20200211>{{cite journal |last1=Makalintal |first1=Bettina |title=Leonardo DiCaprio's 'The Beach' Predicted the Worst of Influencer Culture |journal=Vox |date=11 February 2020 |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5xj54/leonardo-dicaprios-the-beach-predicted-the-worst-of-influencer-culture?utm |accessdate=12 February 2020}}</ref> This attracted criticism, with claims that the film company had damaged the island's environment, as the producers bulldozed beach areas and planted palm trees to make it more resemble descriptions in the book,<ref name=Vox-20200211 /> an accusation the film's makers contest. An increase in tourism was attributed to the film's release, which resulted in increased environmental degradation. Phi Phi Le is home to the \"Viking Cave\", where there is a thriving industry harvesting [[edible bird's nest]]s.\n\nKo Phi Phi was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004]], when nearly all of the island's infrastructure was destroyed.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sunset over a gypsy boat on Koh Phi Phi Island.jpg|thumb|Gypsy boat, Ko Phi Phi]]\nFrom archaeological discoveries, it is believed that the area was one of the oldest communities in Thailand, dating back to the prehistoric period. It is believed that this province may have taken its name from ''Krabi'', which means 'sword'. This may come from a legend that an ancient sword was unearthed prior to the city's founding.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe name ''Phi Phi'' (pronounced \"phi-phi\") originates from [[Malay Language|Malay]]. The original name for the islands was ''Pulau Api-Api'' ('the fiery isle'). The name refers to the ''Pokok Api-Api'', or \"fiery tree\" ([[Avicennia marina|grey mangrove]]) which is found on the islands.\n\n== Geography ==\nThere are six islands in the group known as Phi Phi. They lie {{convert|40|km|abbr=off}} southeast of Phuket and are part of [[Hat Nopparat Thara-Ko Phi Phi National Park]].

There are nine settlements under these two villages.\n\nThe villages are:\n*Laem Thong (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e21\u0e15\u0e07, Mu 8, between 300-500 people)\n:* Ban Ko Mai Phai (about 20 fishermen live on this island)\n:* Ban Laem Tong\n:* Ao Loh Bakhao\n:* Ao Lana\n\n*[[Ko Phi Phi Don|Ko Phi Phi]] (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35, Mu 7, between 1,500 - 2,000 people)\n:* Ao Maya (about 10 people, mostly in the ranger station)\n:* Ton Sai, the capital and largest settlement\n:* Hat Yao\n:* Ao Lodalum\n:* Laem Pho\n\n== Climate ==\nHat Noppharat Thara - Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park is influenced by tropical monsoon winds. There are two seasons: the rainy season from May till December and the hot season from January till April. Average temperature ranges between {{convert|17|\u2013|37|C|F}}. Average rainfall per year is about {{convert|2,231|mm|inch|lk=out|abbr=off}}, with wettest month being July and the driest February.<ref name=DNP/>\n\n== Transportation and communication==\n;Roads\nSince the re-building of Ko Phi Phi after the 2004 tsunami, paved roads now cover the vast majority of Ton Sai Bay and Loh Dalum Bay. All roads are for pedestrian use only with push carts used to transport goods and bags. The only permitted motor vehicles are reserved for emergency services.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Bicycling is the most popular form of transport in Ton Sai.\n\n;Air\nThe nearest airports are at Krabi, Trang, and Phuket. All three have direct road and boat connections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n;Ferry\nThere are frequent ferry boats to Ko Phi Phi from Phuket, Ko Lanta, and Krabi town starting at 08:30. Last boats from Krabi and Phuket depart at 14:30.  In the \"green season\" (Jun-Oct), travel to and from Ko Lanta is via Krabi town only.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.phuketharbour.com/|title=Phuket to Phi Phi Ferry {{!}} Phuket to Phi Phi Speedboat|work=phuketharbour.com|accessdate=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n\nThere is a large modern deep water government pier on Tonsai Bay, Phi Phi Don Village, completed in late-2009. It takes in the main ferry boats from Phuket, Krabi, and Ko Lanta. Visitors to Phi Phi Island must pay 20 baht on arrival at the pier. Dive boats, longtail boats, and supply boats have their own drop off points along the piers, making the pier highly efficient in the peak season.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Ko Phi Phi after sunset, preparing for the night.JPG|thumb|right|Sunset, Ko Phi Phi]]\n[[File:Phi Phi party.jpg|thumb|right|Phi Phi party]]\n\nThe islands feature beaches and clear water, and the natural environment is protected by national park status. Tourism on the islands  exploded since the release of the movie ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.\n\nPhi Phi Le's Maya Bay was closed to tourists from June 2018 until the ecosystem recovers, but at least a year.<ref name=Guardian-20181003/>\n\n[https://www.phiphiislandvillage.com/phiphi-marine-discovery-centre.php Marine Discovery Centre], located at Loh Ba Gao Bay on Koh Phi Phi Don, houses a series of colourful, interactive displays explaining the life cycles and habits of many marine species endemic to the Noppharat Thara - Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park, as well as information on area natural attractions and a gift shop.\n\n== Medical==\nThere is a small hospital on Phi Phi Island for emergencies. Its main purpose is to stabilize emergencies and evacuate to a Phuket hospital.  It is between the Phi Phi Cabana Hotel and the Ton Sai Towers, about a 5\u20137 minute walk from the main pier.\n\n==2004 tsunami==\nOn 26 December 2004, much of the inhabited part of Phi Phi Don was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami]]. The island's main village, Ton Sai (Banyan Tree, {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e23}}), is built on a sandy [[isthmus]] between the island's two long, tall limestone ridges. On both sides of Ton Sai are semicircular bays lined with beaches. The isthmus rises less than  {{convert|2|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]].\n\nShortly after 10:00 on 26 December, the water from both bays receded. When the tsunami hit, at 10:37, it did so from both bays, and met in the middle of the isthmus. The wave that came into Ton Sai Bay was {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} high. The wave that came into Loh Dalum Bay was {{convert|6.5|m|abbr=off}} high. The force of the larger wave from Loh Dalum Bay pushed the tsunami and also breached low-lying areas in the limestone [[karst]]s, passing from Laa Naa Bay to Bakhao Bay, and at Laem Thong ([[Urak Lawoi|Sea Gypsy]] Village), where 11 people died. Apart from these breaches, the east side of the island experienced only flooding and strong currents. A tsunami memorial was built to honor the deceased but has since been removed for the building of a new hotel in 2015.\n\nAt the time of the tsunami, the island had an estimated 10,000 occupants, including tourists.\n\n==Post-tsunami reconstruction==\n[[File:PhiPhiAftermath.jpg|thumb|[[Ko Phi Phi Don]], March 2005 in the aftermath of the tsunami.]]\nAfter the tsunami, approximately 70% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed. By the end of July 2005, an estimated 850 bodies had been recovered, and an estimated 1,200 people were still missing. The total number of fatalities is unlikely to be known. Local tour guides cite the figure 4,000. Of Phi Phi Don residents, 104 surviving children had lost one or both parents.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the permanent residents were housed in a refugee camp at Nong Kok in Krabi Province.\n\nOn 6 January 2005, a former Dutch resident of Phi Phi, Emiel Kok, set up a voluntary organization, ''Help International Phi Phi'' (\"HI Phi Phi\"). HI Phi Phi recruited 68 Thai staff from the refugee camp, as well as transient backpacker volunteers (of whom more than 3,500 offered their assistance), and returned to the island to undertake clearing and rebuilding work. On 18 February 2005, a second organization, Phi Phi Dive Camp,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phiphidivecamp.com |title=PhiPhiDiveCamp.com |publisher=Phiphidivecamp.com |accessdate=2012-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707043309/http://www.phiphidivecamp.com/ |archivedate=2012-07-07 }}</ref> was set up to remove the debris from the bays and coral reef, most of which was in Ton Sai Bay.\n\nBy the end of July 2005, 23,000 tonnes of debris had been removed from the island, of which 7,000 tonnes had been cleared by hand. \"We try and do as much as possible by hand,\" said Kok, \"that way we can search for passports and identification.\" The majority of buildings that were deemed fit for repair by government surveyors had been repaired, and 300 businesses had been restored.

With southern Thailand attracting thousands more tourists every day, Dr Thon makes the point that the ecosystem is under threat and is fast disappearing. \"Economically, a few people may be enriched, but their selfishness will come at great cost to Thailand\", says Dr Thon, a marine biology lecturer at [[Kasetsart University]] and an established environmental writer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sidasathian|first1=Chutima|last2=Morison|first2=Alan|title=Mass Tourism Makes 'a Slum' of Phi Phi|url=http://phuketwan.com/tourism/phi-phi-slum-mass-tourism-destroys-thailands-natural-heritage-22092/|accessdate=15 June 2015|work=Phuket Wan Tourism News|date=2015-03-21}}</ref>\n\nMore than one thousand tourists arrive on Phi Phi daily.

The money is then used to pay a private company to haul the rubbish from the island to the mainland in Krabi to be disposed of\", Mr Pankum Kittithonkun, Ao Nang Administration Organization (''OrBorTor'') President, said. The boat takes about 25 tonnes of trash from the island daily, weather permitting. ''Ao Nang OrBorTor'' pays 600,000 baht per month for the service. During high season, an Ao Nang ''OrBorTor'' boat is used to help transport the overflow of rubbish. Further aggravating Phi Phi's waste issues is sewage. \"We have no wastewater management plant there. Our only hope is that hotels, restaurants and other businesses act responsibly \u2013 but I have no faith in them,\" Mr Pankum said. \"They of course have to treat their own wastewater before releasing it into the sea, but they very well could just be turning the devices on before officers arrive to check them.\" The fundamental issue is that the budget allocated for Ao Nang and Phi Phi is based on its registered population, not on the number of people it hosts every year, Mr Pankum said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Plerin|first1=Chutharat|title=Special Report: Phi Phi cries for help|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Special-Report-Phi-Phi-cries-help|accessdate=29 September 2018|work=The Taiger|date=2014-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Maya Beach, made famous by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s 2000 film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'', was closed indefinitely to allow it to recover.

The islands are reachable by speedboats or [[long-tail boat]]s most often from [[Krabi]] town or from piers in [[Phuket Province]].\n\nPhi Phi Don was initially populated by [[Muslim]] fishermen during the late-1940s, and later became a coconut plantation. The resident Thai population of Phi Phi Don remains more than 80 percent Muslim. The current population however\u2014if counting transient workers\u2014is more Buddhist than Muslim. The resident population is between 2,000 and 3,000 people (2013).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe islands came to worldwide prominence when Ko Phi Phi Le was used as a location for the 2000 [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.<ref name=Vox-20200211>{{cite journal |last1=Makalintal |first1=Bettina |title=Leonardo DiCaprio's 'The Beach' Predicted the Worst of Influencer Culture |journal=Vox |date=11 February 2020 |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5xj54/leonardo-dicaprios-the-beach-predicted-the-worst-of-influencer-culture?utm |accessdate=12 February 2020}}</ref> This attracted criticism, with claims that the film company had damaged the island's environment, as the producers bulldozed beach areas and planted palm trees to make it more resemble descriptions in the book,<ref name=Vox-20200211 /> an accusation the film's makers contest. An increase in tourism was attributed to the film's release, which resulted in increased environmental degradation. Phi Phi Le is home to the \"Viking Cave\", where there is a thriving industry harvesting [[edible bird's nest]]s.\n\nKo Phi Phi was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004]], when nearly all of the island's infrastructure was destroyed.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sunset over a gypsy boat on Koh Phi Phi Island.jpg|thumb|Gypsy boat, Ko Phi Phi]]\nFrom archaeological discoveries, it is believed that the area was one of the oldest communities in Thailand, dating back to the prehistoric period. It is believed that this province may have taken its name from ''Krabi'', which means 'sword'. This may come from a legend that an ancient sword was unearthed prior to the city's founding.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe name ''Phi Phi'' (pronounced \"phi-phi\") originates from [[Malay Language|Malay]]. The original name for the islands was ''Pulau Api-Api'' ('the fiery isle'). The name refers to the ''Pokok Api-Api'', or \"fiery tree\" ([[Avicennia marina|grey mangrove]]) which is found on the islands.\n\n== Geography ==\nThere are six islands in the group known as Phi Phi.

All roads are for pedestrian use only with push carts used to transport goods and bags. The only permitted motor vehicles are reserved for emergency services.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Bicycling is the most popular form of transport in Ton Sai.\n\n;Air\nThe nearest airports are at Krabi, Trang, and Phuket.

Last boats from Krabi and Phuket depart at 14:30.  In the \"green season\" (Jun-Oct), travel to and from Ko Lanta is via Krabi town only.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.phuketharbour.com/|title=Phuket to Phi Phi Ferry {{!}} Phuket to Phi Phi Speedboat|work=phuketharbour.com|accessdate=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n\nThere is a large modern deep water government pier on Tonsai Bay, Phi Phi Don Village, completed in late-2009. It takes in the main ferry boats from Phuket, Krabi, and Ko Lanta. Visitors to Phi Phi Island must pay 20 baht on arrival at the pier. Dive boats, longtail boats, and supply boats have their own drop off points along the piers, making the pier highly efficient in the peak season.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Ko Phi Phi after sunset, preparing for the night.JPG|thumb|right|Sunset, Ko Phi Phi]]\n[[File:Phi Phi party.jpg|thumb|right|Phi Phi party]]\n\nThe islands feature beaches and clear water, and the natural environment is protected by national park status. Tourism on the islands  exploded since the release of the movie ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.\n\nPhi Phi Le's Maya Bay was closed to tourists from June 2018 until the ecosystem recovers, but at least a year.<ref name=Guardian-20181003/>\n\n== Medical==\nThere is a small hospital on Phi Phi Island for emergencies. Its main purpose is to stabilize emergencies and evacuate to a Phuket hospital.  It is between the Phi Phi Cabana Hotel and the Ton Sai Towers, about a 5\u20137 minute walk from the main pier.\n\n==2004 tsunami==\nOn 26 December 2004, much of the inhabited part of Phi Phi Don was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami]]. The island's main village, Ton Sai (Banyan Tree, {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e23}}), is built on a sandy [[isthmus]] between the island's two long, tall limestone ridges. On both sides of Ton Sai are semicircular bays lined with beaches. The isthmus rises less than  {{convert|2|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]].\n\nShortly after 10:00 on 26 December, the water from both bays receded. When the tsunami hit, at 10:37, it did so from both bays, and met in the middle of the isthmus. The wave that came into Ton Sai Bay was {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} high. The wave that came into Loh Dalum Bay was {{convert|6.5|m|abbr=off}} high. The force of the larger wave from Loh Dalum Bay pushed the tsunami and also breached low-lying areas in the limestone [[karst]]s, passing from Laa Naa Bay to Bakhao Bay, and at Laem Thong ([[Urak Lawoi|Sea Gypsy]] Village), where 11 people died. Apart from these breaches, the east side of the island experienced only flooding and strong currents. A tsunami memorial was built to honor the deceased but has since been removed for the building of a new hotel in 2015.\n\nAt the time of the tsunami, the island had an estimated 10,000 occupants, including tourists.\n\n==Post-tsunami reconstruction==\n[[File:PhiPhiAftermath.jpg|thumb|[[Ko Phi Phi Don]], March 2005 in the aftermath of the tsunami.]]\nAfter the tsunami, approximately 70% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed. By the end of July 2005, an estimated 850 bodies had been recovered, and an estimated 1,200 people were still missing. The total number of fatalities is unlikely to be known. Local tour guides cite the figure 4,000. Of Phi Phi Don residents, 104 surviving children had lost one or both parents.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the permanent residents were housed in a refugee camp at Nong Kok in Krabi Province.\n\nOn 6 January 2005, a former Dutch resident of Phi Phi, Emiel Kok, set up a voluntary organization, ''Help International Phi Phi'' (\"HI Phi Phi\"). HI Phi Phi recruited 68 Thai staff from the refugee camp, as well as transient backpacker volunteers (of whom more than 3,500 offered their assistance), and returned to the island to undertake clearing and rebuilding work.

This probability is related to the [[equivalent dose]] in [[sievert]]s (Sv), which has the same dimensions as the gray. It is related to the gray by weighting factors described in the articles on [[equivalent dose]] and [[Effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]].\n\nThe [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] states: \"In order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose ''D'' and the [[dose equivalent]] ''H'', the special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose ''D'' and the name [[sievert]] instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent ''H''.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=CIPM, 2002: Recommendation 2 |publisher=BIPM |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CIPM/db/2002/2/}}</ref>\n:<math>1 \\ \\mathrm{Gy} = 1\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{kg}}= 1\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^2}{\\mathrm{s}^{2}}</math>\n\nThe accompanying diagrams show how absorbed dose (in grays) is first obtained by computational techniques, and from this value the equivalent doses are derived. For X-rays and gamma rays the gray is numerically the same value when expressed in sieverts, but for [[alpha particles]] one gray is equivalent to 20 sieverts, and a radiation weighting factor is applied accordingly.\n\n===Radiation poisoning===\n[[Radiation poisoning]]: The gray is conventionally used to express the severity of what are known as \"tissue effects\" from doses received in acute exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation. These are effects that are ''certain'' to happen, as opposed to the uncertain effects of low levels of radiation that have a ''probability'' of causing damage. A whole-body acute exposure to 5 grays or more of high-energy radiation usually leads to death within 14 days. This dose represents 375 joules for a 75&nbsp;kg adult.\n\n===Absorbed dose in matter===\nThe gray is used to measure absorbed dose rates in non-tissue materials for processes such as [[radiation hardening]], [[food irradiation]] and [[electron irradiation]]. Measuring and controlling the value of absorbed dose is vital to ensuring correct operation of these processes.\n\n===Kerma===\nKerma (\"'''k'''inetic '''e'''nergy '''r'''eleased per unit '''ma'''ss\") is used in radiation metrology as a measure of the liberated energy of ionisation due to irradiation, and is expressed in grays. Importantly, kerma dose is different from absorbed dose, depending on the radiation energies involved, partially because ionization energy is not accounted for. Whilst roughly equal at low energies, kerma is much higher than absorbed dose at higher energies, because some energy escapes from the absorbing volume in the form of [[bremsstrahlung]] (X-rays) or fast-moving electrons. \n\nKerma, when applied to air, is equivalent to the legacy [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] unit of radiation exposure, but there is a difference in the definition of these two units. The gray is defined independently of any target material, however, the roentgen was defined specifically by the ionisation effect in dry air, which did not necessarily represent the effect on other media.\n\n==Development of the absorbed dose concept and the gray==\n[[File:Crookes tube xray experiment.jpg|thumb|Using early [[Crookes tube]] X-Ray apparatus in 1896.

Eventually, in order to promote international standardisation, the first International Congress of Radiology (ICR) meeting in London in 1925, proposed a separate body to consider units of measure. This was called the [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]], or ICRU,{{efn|Originally known as the International X-ray Unit Committee}} and came into being at the Second ICR in Stockholm in 1928, under the chairmanship of [[Manne Siegbahn]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Siegbahn|first=Manne|title=Recommendations of the International X-ray Unit Committee|journal=Radiology|date=October 1929|volume=13|issue=4|pages=372\u20133|doi=10.1148/13.4.372|display-authors=etal}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|title = About ICRU - History\n|url = http://www.icru.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=25&Itemid=63\n|publisher = International Commission on Radiation Units & Measures\n|accessdate = 2012-05-20}}\n</ref>{{efn|The host country nominated the chairman of the early ICRU meetings.}}\n\nOne of the earliest techniques of measuring the intensity of X-rays was to measure their ionising effect in air by means of an air-filled [[ion chamber]]. At the first ICRU meeting it was proposed that one unit of X-ray dose should be defined as the quantity of X-rays that would produce one [[Statcoulomb|esu]] of charge in one [[cubic centimetre]] of dry air at 0&nbsp;[[\u00b0C]] and 1 [[standard pressure|standard atmosphere]] of pressure. This unit of [[radiation exposure]] was named the [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] in honour of Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, who had died five years previously.

This probability is related to the [[equivalent dose]] in [[sievert]]s (Sv), which has the same dimensions as the gray. It is related to the gray by weighting factors described in the articles on [[equivalent dose]] and [[Effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]].\n\nThe [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] states: \"In order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose ''D'' and the [[dose equivalent]] ''H'', the special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose ''D'' and the name [[sievert]] instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent ''H''.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=CIPM, 2002: Recommendation 2 |publisher=BIPM |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CIPM/db/2002/2/}}</ref>\n:<math>1 \\ \\mathrm{Gy} = 1\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{kg}}= 1\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^2}{\\mathrm{s}^{2}}</math>\n\nThe accompanying diagrams show how absorbed dose (in grays) is first obtained by computational techniques, and from this value the equivalent doses are derived. For X-rays and gamma rays the gray is numerically the same value when expressed in sieverts, but for [[alpha particles]] one gray is equivalent to 20 sieverts, and a radiation weighting factor is applied accordingly.\n\n===Radiation poisoning===\n[[Radiation poisoning]] - The gray is conventionally used to express the severity of what are known as \"tissue effects\" from doses received in acute exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation. These are effects that are ''certain'' to happen, as opposed to the uncertain effects of low levels of radiation that have a ''probability'' of causing damage. A whole-body acute exposure to 5 grays or more of high-energy radiation usually leads to death within 14 days. This dose represents 375 joules for a 75&nbsp;kg adult.\n\n===Absorbed dose in matter===\nThe gray is used to measure absorbed dose rates in non-tissue materials for processes such as [[radiation hardening]], [[food irradiation]] and [[electron irradiation]]. Measuring and controlling the value of absorbed dose is vital to ensuring correct operation of these processes.\n\n===Kerma===\nKerma (\"'''k'''inetic '''e'''nergy '''r'''eleased per unit '''ma'''ss\") is used in radiation metrology as a measure of the liberated energy of ionisation due to irradiation, and is expressed in grays. Importantly, kerma dose is different from absorbed dose, depending on the radiation energies involved, partially because ionization energy is not accounted for. Whilst roughly equal at low energies, kerma is much higher than absorbed dose at higher energies, because some energy escapes from the absorbing volume in the form of [[bremsstrahlung]] (X-rays) or fast-moving electrons. \n\nKerma, when applied to air, is equivalent to the legacy [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] unit of radiation exposure, but there is a difference in the definition of these two units. The gray is defined independently of any target material, however, the roentgen was defined specifically by the ionisation effect in dry air, which did not necessarily represent the effect on other media.\n\n==Development of the absorbed dose concept and the gray==\n[[File:Crookes tube xray experiment.jpg|thumb|Using early [[Crookes tube]] X-Ray apparatus in 1896.

Eventually, in order to promote international standardisation, the first International Congress of Radiology (ICR) meeting in London in 1925, proposed a separate body to consider units of measure. This was called the [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]], or ICRU,{{efn|Originally known as the International X-ray Unit Committee}} and came into being at the Second ICR in Stockholm in 1928, under the chairmanship of [[Manne Siegbahn]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Siegbahn|first=Manne|title=Recommendations of the International X-ray Unit Committee|journal=Radiology|date=October 1929|volume=13|issue=4|pages=372\u20133|doi=10.1148/13.4.372|display-authors=etal}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|title = About ICRU - History\n|url = http://www.icru.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=25&Itemid=63\n|publisher = International Commission on Radiation Units & Measures\n|accessdate = 2012-05-20}}\n</ref>{{efn|The host country nominated the chairman of the early ICRU meetings.}}\n\nOne of the earliest techniques of measuring the intensity of X-rays was to measure their ionising effect in air by means of an air-filled [[ion chamber]]. At the first ICRU meeting it was proposed that one unit of X-ray dose should be defined as the quantity of X-rays that would produce one [[Statcoulomb|esu]] of charge in one [[cubic centimetre]] of dry air at 0&nbsp;[[\u00b0C]] and 1 [[standard pressure|standard atmosphere]] of pressure. This unit of [[radiation exposure]] was named the [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] in honour of Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, who had died five years previously. At the 1937 meeting of the ICRU, this definition was extended to apply to [[gamma radiation]].<ref name=GM>{{cite conference\n|title = Dosimetry in Europe and the USSR\n|first1 = JH\n|last1 = Guill\n|first2 =John\n|last2 = Moteff\n|page = 64\n|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=czTi4G6-Hq8C&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=roentgen+redefinition#v=onepage&q=roentgen%20redefinition&f=false\n|conference = Symposium on Radiation Effects and Dosimetry - Third Pacific Area Meeting American Society for Testing Materials, October 1959, San Francisco, 12\u201316 October 1959\n|publisher = ASTM International\n|booktitle = Third Pacific Area Meeting Papers \u2014 Materials in Nuclear Applications |series=American Society Technical Publication |volume=276\n|lccn = 60014734\n|date = June 1960\n|accessdate = 2012-05-15}}</ref> This approach, although a great step forward in standardisation, had the disadvantage of not being a direct measure of the absorption of radiation, and thereby the ionisation effect, in various types of matter including human tissue, and was a measurement only of the effect of the X-rays in a specific circumstance; the ionisation effect in dry air.<ref name=Lovell4>{{cite book\n|chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=lK48AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=roentgen+defined#v=onepage&q=roentgen%20defined&f=false\n|title = An introduction to Radiation Dosimetry\n|first1 = S\n|last1 = Lovell\n|year = 1979\n|chapter = 4: Dosimetric quantities and units\n|pages = 52\u201364\n|isbn = 0-521-22436-5\n|publisher = Cambridge University Press\n|accessdate = 2012-05-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, Louis Harold Gray, who had been studying the effect of neutron damage on human tissue, together with [[William Valentine Mayneord]] and the radiobiologist John Read, published a paper in which a new unit of measure, dubbed the ''\"gram roentgen\"'' (symbol: gr) was proposed, and defined as \"that amount of neutron radiation which produces an increment in energy in unit volume of tissue equal to the increment of energy produced in unit volume of water by one roentgen of radiation\".<ref name=\"Gupta2009\">{{cite book|last=Gupta|first=S.

The rad was expressed in coherent [[Cgs system|cgs]] units.<ref name=GM/> \n\nIn the late 1950s, the CGPM invited the ICRU to join other scientific bodies to work on the development of the [[International System of Units]], or SI.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cc/ccu/\n|title = CCU: Consultative Committee for Units\n|publisher = [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM)\n|accessdate = 2012-05-18}}</ref> The CCU decided to define the SI unit of absorbed radiation as energy deposited per unit mass, which is how the rad had been defined, but in [[MKS system of units|MKS units]] it would be J/kg.
