''Microraptor'' had long [[pennaceous feather]]s that formed aerodynamic surfaces on the arms and tail but also on the legs. This led paleontologist [[Xu Xing (paleontologist)|Xu Xing]] in 2003 to describe the first specimen to preserve this feature as a \"four-winged dinosaur\" and to speculate that it may have [[Gliding flight|glided]] using all four limbs for lift. Subsequent studies have suggested that ''Microraptor'' was capable of powered flight as well.\n\n''Microraptor'' was among the most abundant non-[[Avialae|avialan]] dinosaurs in its ecosystem, and the genus is represented by more fossils than any other dromaeosaurid, with possibly over 300 fossil specimens represented across various museum collections.<ref name=alexanderetal2010/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Microraptor scale.png|thumb|left|Wingspan and body size compared with a human]]\nWith adult specimens estimated up to {{convert|77|cm|ft|disp=x| long (}}) and with a weight estimated up to {{convert|1|kg}}, ''Microraptor'' was among the [[Dinosaur size|smallest-known non-avian dinosaurs]].<ref name=\"chatterjee2007\"/> Holtz estimated it at {{convert|90|cm|ft}}.<ref name=\"Holtz2008\">Holtz, Thomas R.

Unusual even among early birds and feathered dinosaurs, ''Microraptor'' is one of the few known bird precursors to sport long flight feathers on the legs as well as the wings. Their bodies had a thick covering of feathers, with a diamond-shaped fan on the end of the tail (possibly for added stability during flight). Xu ''et al.''

This standard wing pattern was mirrored on the hindlegs, with [[flight feather]]s anchored to the upper foot bones as well as the upper and lower leg.

He noted that the ''Microraptor's'' fused sternum, asymmetrical feathers, and features of the shoulder girdle indicated that it could fly under its own power, rather than merely gliding. Today, most scientists agree that ''Microraptor'' had the anatomical features expected of a flying animal, though it would have been a less advanced form of flight compared to birds. For example, some studies suggest the shoulder joint was too primitive to allow a full flapping flight stroke. In the ancestral anatomy of theropod dinosaurs, the shoulder socket faced downward and slightly backward, making it impossible for the animals to raise their arms vertically, a prerequisite for the flapping flight stroke in birds. Studies of maniraptoran anatomy have suggested that the shoulder socket did not shift into the bird-like position of a high, upward orientation close to the [[vertebra]]l column until relatively advanced avialans like the [[enantiornithes]] appeared.<ref name=senter2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Senter | first1 = P | year = 2006 | title = Scapular orientation in theropods and basal birds, and the origin of flapping flight | url = | journal = Acta Palaeontol.

This possibly advanced shoulder anatomy, combined with the presence of a [[Patagium|propatagium]] linking the wrist to the shoulder (which fills the space in front of the flexed wing and may support the wing against drag in modern birds) and an [[alula]], much like a \"thumb-like\" form of [[leading edge slot]], may indicate that ''Microraptor'' was capable of true, powered flight.<ref name=avianancestry>{{Cite journal|author1=Federico L.

Paul, and others have argued that the fact ''Microraptor'' could fly and yet is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid suggests that the [[Dromaeosauridae]], including later and larger species such as ''[[Deinonychus]]'', were secondarily flightless.

Using this biplane model, Chatterjee was able to calculate possible methods of gliding, and determined that ''Microraptor'' most likely employed a ''[[phugoid]]'' style of gliding: launching itself from a perch, the animal would have swooped downward in a deep U-shaped curve and then lifted again to land on another tree. The feathers not directly employed in the biplane [[wing]] structure, like those on the [[tibia]] and the [[tail]], could have been used to control drag and alter the [[Airway (aviation)|flight path]], [[trajectory]], etc. The orientation of the hindwings would also have helped the animal control its gliding flight. Chatterjee also used computer [[algorithm]]s that test [[Flying and gliding animals|animal flight]] capacity to test whether or not ''Microraptor'' was capable of true, powered flight, as opposed to or in addition to passive gliding. The resulting data showed that ''Microraptor'' did have the requirements to sustain level powered flight, so it is theoretically possible that the animal flew, as opposed to gliding.<ref name=\"chatterjee2007\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chatterjee | first1 = S. | last2 = Templin | first2 = R.J. | year = 2007 | title = Biplane wing planform and flight performance of the feathered dinosaur ''Microraptor gui'' | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0609975104v1.pdf | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 104 | issue = 5| pages = 1576\u20131580 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0609975104 | pmid=17242354 | pmc=1780066| bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.1576C }}</ref>\n\nSome paleontologists have doubted the biplane hypothesis, and have proposed other configurations. A 2010 study by Alexander ''et al.'' described the construction of a lightweight three-dimensional physical model used to perform glide tests. Using several hindleg configurations for the model, they found that the biplane model, while not unreasonable, was structurally deficient and needed a heavy-headed weight distribution for stable gliding, which they deemed unlikely.

Brougham and Brusatte criticized the anatomy of the model used by Alexander and his team, noting that the hip anatomy was not consistent with other dromaeosaurs. In most dromaeosaurids, features of the hip bone prevent the legs from splaying horizontally; instead, they are locked in a vertical position below the body. Alexander's team used a specimen of ''Microraptor'' which was crushed flat to make their model, which Brougham and Brusatte argued did not reflect its actual anatomy.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brusatte | first1 = Stephen L. | last2 = Brougham | first2 = Jason | year = 2010| title = Distorted ''Microraptor'' specimen is not ideal for understanding the origin of avian flight | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | volume = 107| issue = 40| pages = E155| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1004977107 | pmid = 20864633 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107E.155B| pmc = 2951411}}</ref> Later in 2010, Alexander's team responded to these criticisms, noting that the related dromaeosaur ''[[Hesperonychus]]'', which is known from complete hip bones preserved in three dimensions, also shows hip sockets directed partially upward, possibly allowing the legs to splay more than in other dromaeosaurs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = D.E. | last2 = Gong | first2 = E. | last3 = Martin | first3 = L.D. | last4 = Burnham | first4 = D.A. | last5 = Falk | first5 = A.R. | year = 2010 | title = Reply to Brougham and Brusatte: Overall anatomy confirms posture and flight model offers insight into the evolution of bird flight | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | volume = 107| issue = 40| pages = E155| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1004977107 | pmid = 20864633 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107E.155B | pmc = 2951411 }}</ref>\n\n===Ground movement===\n[[File:Microraptor by durbed.jpg|thumb|Restoration of two individuals by the ground]]\nDue to the extent of the hindwings onto most of the animal's foot, many scientists have suggested that ''Microraptor'' would have been awkward during normal ground movement or running. The front wing feathers would also have hindered ''Microraptor'' when on the ground, due to the limited range of motion in the wrist and the extreme length of the wing feathers. A 2010 study by Corwin Sullivan and colleagues showed that, even with the wing folded as far as possible, the feathers would still have dragged along the ground if the arms were held in a neutral position, or extended forward as in a predatory strike. Only by keeping the wings elevated, or the upper arm extended fully backward, could ''Microraptor'' have avoided damaging the wing feathers. Therefore, it may have been anatomically impossible for ''Microraptor'' to have used its clawed forelimbs in capturing prey or manipulating objects.<ref name=sullivanetal2010>{{cite journal | last1 = Sullivan | first1 = C. | last2 = Hone | first2 = D.W.E. | last3 = Xu | first3 = X. | last4 = Zhang | first4 = F. | year = 2010 | title = The asymmetry of the carpal joint and the evolution of wing folding in maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 277 | issue = 1690| pages = 2027\u20132033 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.2281 | pmid = 20200032 | pmc = 2880093 }}</ref>\n\n===Implications===\n[[File:Tetrapteryx.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Beebe]]'s hypothetical \"''Tetrapteryx''\" with four wings, 1915]]\nThe unique wing arrangement found in ''Microraptor'' raised the question of whether the evolution of flight in modern birds went through a four-winged stage, or whether four-winged gliders like ''Microraptor'' were an evolutionary side-branch that left no descendants.

Seven specimens of ''M. zhaoianus'' have been described in detail, from which most feather impressions are known. Unusual even among early birds and feathered dinosaurs, ''Microraptor'' is one of the few known bird precursors to sport long flight feathers on the legs as well as the wings. Their bodies had a thick covering of feathers, with a diamond-shaped fan on the end of the tail (possibly for added stability during flight). Xu ''et al.''

In ''Microraptor'', these cells were shaped in a manner consistent with black, glossy coloration in modern birds.

As in modern bird wings, ''Microraptor'' had both primary (anchored to the hand) and secondary (anchored to the arm) flight feathers. This standard wing pattern was mirrored on the hindlegs, with [[flight feather]]s anchored to the upper foot bones as well as the upper and lower leg.

He noted that the ''Microraptor's'' fused sternum, asymmetrical feathers, and features of the shoulder girdle indicated that it could fly under its own power, rather than merely gliding. Today, most scientists agree that ''Microraptor'' had the anatomical features expected of a flying animal, though it would have been a less advanced form of flight compared to birds. For example, some studies suggest the shoulder joint was too primitive to allow a full flapping flight stroke. In the ancestral anatomy of theropod dinosaurs, the shoulder socket faced downward and slightly backward, making it impossible for the animals to raise their arms vertically, a prerequisite for the flapping flight stroke in birds. Studies of maniraptoran anatomy have suggested that the shoulder socket did not shift into the bird-like position of a high, upward orientation close to the [[vertebra]]l column until relatively advanced avialans like the [[enantiornithes]] appeared.<ref name=senter2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Senter | first1 = P | year = 2006 | title = Scapular orientation in theropods and basal birds, and the origin of flapping flight | url = | journal = Acta Palaeontol.

This possibly advanced shoulder anatomy, combined with the presence of a [[Patagium|propatagium]] linking the wrist to the shoulder (which fills the space in front of the flexed wing and may support the wing against drag in modern birds) and an [[alula]], much like a \"thumb-like\" form of [[leading edge slot]], may indicate that ''Microraptor'' was capable of true, powered flight.<ref name=avianancestry>{{Cite journal|author1=Federico L.

Paul, and others have argued that the fact ''Microraptor'' could fly and yet is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid suggests that the [[Dromaeosauridae]], including later and larger species such as ''[[Deinonychus]]'', were secondarily flightless. The work of Xu and colleagues also suggested that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids were probably small, arboreal, and capable of [[Gliding flight|gliding]], although later discoveries of more primitive dromaeosaurids with short forelimbs unsuitable for gliding have cast doubt on this view.<ref name=\"Xuetal2003\"/><ref name=Turneretal07>{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = Alan H. | last2 = Pol | first2 = Diego | last3 = Clarke | first3 = Julia A. | last4 = Erickson | first4 = Gregory M. | last5 = Norell | first5 = Mark | year = 2007 | title = A basal dromaeosaurid and size evolution preceding avian flight | url = | journal = Science | volume = 317 | issue = 5843| pages = 1378\u20131381 | doi = 10.1126/science.1144066 | pmid = 17823350 | bibcode = 2007Sci...317.1378T }}</ref> Work done on the question of flight ability in other paravians, however, showed that most of them probably would not have been able to achieve enough lift for powered flight, given their limited flight strokes and relatively smaller wings.

Using this biplane model, Chatterjee was able to calculate possible methods of gliding, and determined that ''Microraptor'' most likely employed a ''[[phugoid]]'' style of gliding: launching itself from a perch, the animal would have swooped downward in a deep U-shaped curve and then lifted again to land on another tree. The feathers not directly employed in the biplane [[wing]] structure, like those on the [[tibia]] and the [[tail]], could have been used to control drag and alter the [[Airway (aviation)|flight path]], [[trajectory]], etc. The orientation of the hindwings would also have helped the animal control its gliding flight. Chatterjee also used computer [[algorithm]]s that test [[Flying and gliding animals|animal flight]] capacity to test whether or not ''Microraptor'' was capable of true, powered flight, as opposed to or in addition to passive gliding. The resulting data showed that ''Microraptor'' did have the requirements to sustain level powered flight, so it is theoretically possible that the animal flew, as opposed to gliding.<ref name=\"chatterjee2007\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chatterjee | first1 = S. | last2 = Templin | first2 = R.J. | year = 2007 | title = Biplane wing planform and flight performance of the feathered dinosaur ''Microraptor gui'' | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0609975104v1.pdf | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 104 | issue = 5| pages = 1576\u20131580 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0609975104 | pmid=17242354 | pmc=1780066| bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.1576C }}</ref>\n\nSome paleontologists have doubted the biplane hypothesis, and have proposed other configurations. A 2010 study by Alexander ''et al.'' described the construction of a lightweight three-dimensional physical model used to perform glide tests. Using several hindleg configurations for the model, they found that the biplane model, while not unreasonable, was structurally deficient and needed a heavy-headed weight distribution for stable gliding, which they deemed unlikely. The study indicated that a laterally abducted hindwing structure represented the most biologically and aerodynamically consistent configuration for ''Microraptor''.<ref name=alexanderetal2010>{{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = D.E. | last2 = Gong | first2 = E. | last3 = Martin | first3 = L.D. | last4 = Burnham | first4 = D.A. | last5 = Falk | first5 = A.R. | year = 2010 | title = Model tests of gliding with different hindwing configurations in the four-winged dromaeosaurid ''Microraptor gui'' | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | volume = 107 | issue = 7| pages = 2972\u20132976 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0911852107 | pmid = 20133792 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.2972A | pmc = 2840342 }}</ref> A further analysis by Brougham and Brusatte, however, concluded that Alexander's model reconstruction was not consistent with all of the available data on ''Microraptor'' and argued that the study was insufficient for determining a likely flight pattern for ''Microraptor''. Brougham and Brusatte criticized the anatomy of the model used by Alexander and his team, noting that the hip anatomy was not consistent with other dromaeosaurs. In most dromaeosaurids, features of the hip bone prevent the legs from splaying horizontally; instead, they are locked in a vertical position below the body. Alexander's team used a specimen of ''Microraptor'' which was crushed flat to make their model, which Brougham and Brusatte argued did not reflect its actual anatomy.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brusatte | first1 = Stephen L. | last2 = Brougham | first2 = Jason | year = 2010| title = Distorted ''Microraptor'' specimen is not ideal for understanding the origin of avian flight | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | volume = 107| issue = 40| pages = E155| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1004977107 | pmid = 20864633 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107E.155B| pmc = 2951411}}</ref> Later in 2010, Alexander's team responded to these criticisms, noting that the related dromaeosaur ''[[Hesperonychus]]'', which is known from complete hip bones preserved in three dimensions, also shows hip sockets directed partially upward, possibly allowing the legs to splay more than in other dromaeosaurs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = D.E. | last2 = Gong | first2 = E. | last3 = Martin | first3 = L.D. | last4 = Burnham | first4 = D.A. | last5 = Falk | first5 = A.R. | year = 2010 | title = Reply to Brougham and Brusatte: Overall anatomy confirms posture and flight model offers insight into the evolution of bird flight | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | volume = 107| issue = 40| pages = E155| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1004977107 | pmid = 20864633 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107E.155B | pmc = 2951411 }}</ref>\n\n===Ground movement===\n[[File:Microraptor by durbed.jpg|thumb|Restoration of two individuals by the ground]]\nDue to the extent of the hindwings onto most of the animal's foot, many scientists have suggested that ''Microraptor'' would have been awkward during normal ground movement or running. The front wing feathers would also have hindered ''Microraptor'' when on the ground, due to the limited range of motion in the wrist and the extreme length of the wing feathers. A 2010 study by Corwin Sullivan and colleagues showed that, even with the wing folded as far as possible, the feathers would still have dragged along the ground if the arms were held in a neutral position, or extended forward as in a predatory strike. Only by keeping the wings elevated, or the upper arm extended fully backward, could ''Microraptor'' have avoided damaging the wing feathers. Therefore, it may have been anatomically impossible for ''Microraptor'' to have used its clawed forelimbs in capturing prey or manipulating objects.<ref name=sullivanetal2010>{{cite journal | last1 = Sullivan | first1 = C. | last2 = Hone | first2 = D.W.E. | last3 = Xu | first3 = X. | last4 = Zhang | first4 = F. | year = 2010 | title = The asymmetry of the carpal joint and the evolution of wing folding in maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 277 | issue = 1690| pages = 2027\u20132033 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.2281 | pmid = 20200032 | pmc = 2880093 }}</ref>\n\n===Implications===\n[[File:Tetrapteryx.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Beebe]]'s hypothetical \"''Tetrapteryx''\" with four wings, 1915]]\nThe unique wing arrangement found in ''Microraptor'' raised the question of whether the evolution of flight in modern birds went through a four-winged stage, or whether four-winged gliders like ''Microraptor'' were an evolutionary side-branch that left no descendants.

However, based on the presence of unusually long leg feathers in various feathered dinosaurs, ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', and some modern birds such as raptors, as well as the discovery of further dinosaur with long primary feathers on their feet (such as ''[[Pedopenna]]''), the authors argued that the current body of evidence, both from morphology and phylogeny, suggests that bird flight did shift at some point from shared limb dominance to front-limb dominance, and that all modern birds may have evolved from four-winged ancestors, or at least ancestors with unusually long leg feathers relative to the modern configuration.<ref name=\"chatterjee2007\"/>\n\n===Feeding===\n[[File:Microraptor gui cast.jpg|thumb|Close-up of a cast]]\nIn 2010 researchers announced that further preparation of the type fossil of ''M. zhaoianus'' revealed preserved probable gut contents.

He cited the fused sternum and asymmetrical feathers, and argued that ''Microraptor'' has modern bird features that make it more derived than ''Archaeopteryx''. Czerkas cited the fact that this possibly volant animal is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid to suggest that the [[Dromaeosauridae]] might actually be a basal bird group, and that later, larger, species such as ''[[Deinonychus]]'' were secondarily flightless (Czerkas, 2002). The current consensus is that there is not enough evidence to conclude whether dromaeosaurs descended from an ancestor with some aerodynamic abilities. The work of Xu ''et al.''

He was director and president of many Michigan manufacturing firms, and was also a member on the board of directors of several banks, insurance firms, and other enterprises throughout the United States. He is most notable for his longstanding tenure as a key executive with the [[Michigan Stove Company]].\n\n== Early life ==\nBarbour was born in [[Collinsville, Connecticut]], on June 26, 1843.{{sfn|Marquis|1908|page=46}}<ref name=DetroitCaptains/> His parents were Samuel Thompson and Phoebe (n\u00e9e Beckwith) Barbour.

Jane, his wife, is the first white woman to be married in Connecticut.<ref name=Statesman/> The family name changed from \"Barber\" to \"Barbour\" by the time George was born. He was the youngest of six children in the family; he had two older brothers and three older sisters.{{sfn|White|1922|page=365}}{{sfn|Carlisle|1897|page=16}}\n\nBarbour began his education in the public schools in and around Collinsville and started helping his father in a [[general store]] there when he was 9 years old.{{sfn|White|1922|page=365}}{{sfn|Carlisle|1897|page=16}}<ref name=DetroitCaptains>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Detroit Captains of Industry |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41727383/ |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |page=42  |location=Detroit, Michigan|date= May 21, 1905 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}</ref> He would attend school the first part of the day and assisted his father at the store for the remainder.<ref name=DetroitCaptains/> In 1861 he became a partner in the store business. A year later his father retired and sold his portion of the business to his brother-in-law, J. E. Goodman. Barbour was nineteen years old when it was renamed Goodman & Barbour.{{sfn|White|1922|page=365}} The business sold general merchandise such as [[dry goods]], [[groceries]], [[shoes]], [[boots]], [[hats]] and other miscellaneous items. Barbour succeeded in running the general store and in two years paid off the debt to his father for the partnership share. A year later he purchased Goodman's share and fully owned the store; Barbour ran the store business alone until 1872.{{sfn|Bersey|1890|page=122}}\n\n== Mid life ==\nBarbour was interested in a newly formed [[foundry]] business in 1871 called the Michigan Stove Company. The following year, he negotiated with the founder [[Jeremiah Dwyer]] to buy an interest in the company, sold the general store in Collinsville, and moved to Detroit, becoming the secretary and sales manager of Dwyer's business. The sales department at that time consisted of only one other salesman besides himself.

If I go now, they'll make me check into a hospital.\" On June 4, doctors told Kirkland he had a congestive heart condition that required an operation. He attributed his poor health to twenty years of touring without adequate vacations and exercise, and deemed his chances of surviving any surgery 50/50 or less. Fearful of having a cardiac procedure, Kirkland accepted his fate and was soon on the road with Branford Marsalis again.

{"title_page": "87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), CEF", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\nThe '''87th Battalion ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards|Canadian Grenadier Guards]]), CEF''' was a Household Foot Guards Infantry unit in the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized Sept. 15, 1915, as an exclusively CGG formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began Oct. 23, 1915.  \n\n<br />\n\n== Unit distinctions & Achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n<br />\n\n* '''CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.'''\n\n* '''The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada.''' (The other 2 were R.C.R., and P.P.C.L.I.)\n\n* '''The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War.''' ''The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77<sup>th</sup> Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF.\u00a0 The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4<sup>th</sup> & 7<sup>th</sup> \u2019Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF.\u00a0 But these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.''\n\n* '''Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by HM King George V in 1919 as a permanent distinction''' in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n\n* '''87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918.''' Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit Milestones ==\n\n=== Mobilization & England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|Empress of Britain]] on April 23rd, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5th, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27th at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 16') and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and 4 drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13th, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & Casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel|Battle of Mount Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF|1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment) CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (Later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced & indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning Aug. 18, 1916 in the Ypres area.\u00a0 Their first casualties, 2 wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26th, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16th, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 35 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n\nSomme 1916\n\n\nVimy Ridge\n<br />\n==Officers Commanding==\n\n*Lieut.-Col.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized Sept. 15, 1915, as an exclusively CGG formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began Oct. 23, 1915.  \n\n<br />\n\n== Unit distinctions & Achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n<br />\n\n* '''CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.'''\n\n* '''The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada.''' (The other 2 were R.C.R., and P.P.C.L.I.)\n\n* '''The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War.''' ''The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77<sup>th</sup> Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF.\u00a0 The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4<sup>th</sup> & 7<sup>th</sup> \u2019Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF.\u00a0 But these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.''\n\n* '''Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by HM King George V in 1919 as a permanent distinction''' in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n\n* '''87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918.''' Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit Milestones ==\n\n=== Mobilization & England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|Empress of Britain]] on April 23rd, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5th, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27th at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 16') and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and 4 drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13th, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & Casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel|Battle of Mount Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF|1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment) CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (Later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced & indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning Aug. 18, 1916 in the Ypres area.\u00a0 Their first casualties, 2 wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26th, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16th, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 35 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n\nSomme 1916\n\n\nVimy Ridge\n<br />\n==Officers Commanding==\n\n*Lieut.-Col.

It was produced by John Holmes alongside Jo Porter, MaryAnne Carroll and Di Drew. The final episode aired on 27 October 2009, completing its recording-breaking 12-year run.\n\n== Plot ==\n''All Saints'' follows the lives of the staff at All Saints Western General Hospital. Until its closure in 2004, the show primarily focused on the staff in Ward 17. Known as the \"garbage ward\" as it took all the overflow from the other wards, Ward 17 was run by compassionate nun, Sister Terri Sullivan ([[Georgie Parker]]). Her staff included her nurses Connor Costello ([[Jeremy Cumpston]]), Von Ryan ([[Judith McGrath]]), Bronwyn Craig ([[Libby Tanner]]), Jared Levine ([[Ben Tari]]) and Stephanie Markham ([[Kirrily White]]) and her ward clerk Jaz Hillerman ([[Sam Healy]]). Luke Forlano ([[Martin Lynes]]) and Peter Morrison ([[Andrew McKaige]]) were doctors who frequently worked with Terri and her staff. Ben Markham ([[Brian Vriends]]) was an ambulance officer who worked closely with Luke, despite their rivalry. Bronwyn left Ward 17 and became an ambulance officer at the end of 1998 but returned to the ward full-time at the end of season 3.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main cast ===\n{| class=\"wikitable

something in response to considerable drop in ratings and to prolong the life of the series.<ref name=\"ED\"/>\n\nIn February 2004, John Holmes told [[The Age]] journalist Debi Enker that ''All Saints'' would be undergoing \"major surgery\" when the focus shifted from Ward 17 to the Emergency Department. He also stated that while four familiar faces will be leaving, new characters will be introduced to fill the void. Holmes recalled a statement that he made in May 2003 in which he said, \"we [myself and Seven script executive Bevan Lee] were seeing the scripts and watching episodes and we were feeling that there was a little bit of a sameness in it. We started to think, 'Don't know about this. Sixth year. Maybe we've had a few too many people through the door of Ward 17 on a trolley and had the 'Hi, I'm Von, I'm your nurse. Room Three, thanks Sterlo.'\" After tossing up between cancelling the show and using it as the foundation of a spin-off series, Holmes and Lee decided to rejuvenate the show by changing the setting. Ward 17 would then close and the show would be relocated to the Emergency Department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/extrememakeover.html|title=''All Saints'' gets an extreme makeover|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Age]]|last=Enker|first=Debi|date=19 February 2004|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the shift, several cast members decided to leave the show. Paula Morgan ([[Jenni Baird]]), Luke Forlano ([[Martin Lynes]]), Alex Kearns ([[Fletcher Humphrys]]) and Sterling McCormack ([[Henry Nixon]]) were all written out of the show. Former ''[[Always Greener]]'' star [[John Howard (Australian actor)|John Howard]] signed a three-year deal and was added to the cast as the cranky head of Emergency, Dr. Frank Campion. Other new faces included [[Wil Traval]] as Dr. Jack Quade, [[Mark Priestley]] and [[Natalie Saleeba]] as nurses Dan Goldman and Jessica Singleton and [[Alexandra Davies]] as ambulance officer Cate McMasters.<ref name=\"ED\">{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/fourstarsdumped.html|title=Four ''All Saints'' stars dumped|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Herald Sun]]|last=Byrne|first=Fiona|date=23 November 2003|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009 another attempt to stem the softening ratings and add a bit of excitement to the series, [[Seven Network]] executives decided to rejuvenate again, introducing a medical response unit to deal with tricky rescues which involved a helicopter going to remote locations to rescue patients who needed assistance. They would then bring those patients back to the ED and the staff there would assist in their treatment. Along with the addition of the new \"department\" the show was also renamed to ''All Saints: Medical Response Unit'', the introduction of [[Mirrah Foulkes]] and the new MRU proved to lift the ratings substantially, but then levelled out at where they were prior to the revamp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/trioaddenergy.html|title=MRU trio add energy injection to ''All Saints''|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Courier Mail]]|last=McWhirter|first=Erin|date=20 January 2009|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2009, after months of rumours that the cancellation of ''All Saints'' was imminent, a spokeswoman from the [[Seven Network]] informed [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] that the episode order had been trimmed. Season twelve of ''All Saints'' would screen 24 episodes instead of the usual 40 episodes and that production would cease in August instead of November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/allsaintsalive.html|title=All Saints alive, with a bit of surgery|publisher= Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 June 2009|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2009, exactly one month later after the first announcement, Tim Worner, Seven's Director of Programming at the time announced that ''All Saints'' had been cancelled. He told Michael Idato of the [[Sydney Morning Herald]], \"''All Saints'' is a show which Seven and viewers have loved. However, an audience shift and increased production costs are behind this tough decision.\" He also informed Idato that the episode order trim had been reverted and the season would complete a 37 episode order, finishing on episode 493. It was reported after the announcement that since the introduction of the MRU in 2009 it inflated the cost of each episode to $500,000. Many people still argue as to why the MRU was introduced in the first place or should have been removed instead of axing the show if the network was wanting to cut costs.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/tvcasualty.html|title=TV casualty: ''All Saints'' axed after 11 years|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|last=Idato|first=Michael|date=9 July 2009|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the Feb/Mar 2010 GQ magazine in 2010, Tim Worner said his one regret was \"Axing All Saints. But it was the right call at the time and we have two new drama projects in development.\"\n\n=== Controversy ===\n\n==== Episode 265 ====\nOn 20 April 2004, episode 265, \"Brave New World\" aired, which saw the introduction of [[John Howard (Australian actor)|John Howard]]'s character, Frank Campion. It was also the first episode to be set in the Emergency Department. This episode attracted lots of controversy.\n\nOne patient came into the triage and tried to get help, but he was told to wait. Later on, Nelson heard a phone ring coming from the patient and asked him to turn off the phone. It was later hinted that he had been using the phone to masturbate and it had gotten stuck in his rectum.\n\nThe end of the episode saw Frank go introduce himself to Terri ([[Georgie Parker]]), who was recovering from heart surgery. During a heated argument about staff members, Frank blatantly said to Terri, \"if you ever use your influence with your previous employees to white-ant me again, you will never work in Emergency.\" Before Terri could get a word in, Frank added, \"can I make it any fucking clearer?\"<ref name=\"Not So Saintly\">{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/notsosaintly.html|title=My sainted aunt! F-words and a lost mobile|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Courier Mail]]|last=Chalmers|first=Emma|date=22 April 2004|accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe next day, [[Channel 7 Australia|Channel Seven]] announced that they had received more than 100 phone calls in Melbourne alone. Parker told the media, \"it's a good response because it's not about the shock words\u2014we've sworn on the show before\u2014but because people clearly feel really protective about Terri. It's like they really feel for her as a character and don't like her being under attack by a very confronting man. It's great to know they care for her so much.\"<ref name=\"Not So Saintly\"/>\n\nOn 22 April, the network issued a statement that read, \"within an M classification code, coarse language is permitted provided it is appropriate to the storyline or program context.\" An apology was not made.<ref name=\"Not So Saintly\"/>\n\n==== Episode 432 ====\nOn 27 May 2008, episode 432, \"Never Tell\" aired.\n\nThis episode saw a woman pregnant from an incestuous relationship with her brother, told her child may have Down syndrome as a result.\n\nLeading geneticist Dr. David Amor of Murdoch Children's Research Institute stated, \"There is absolutely no increase in the risk of Down syndrome for the offspring of incestuous relationships.\"<ref name=\"SevenApologises\">{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/sevenapologises.html|title=Seven apologises for incest episode|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Age]]|last=Ricketson|first=Matthew|date=3 June 2008|accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nDown Syndrome Australia considered legal action, complained to the media regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority and called for a boycott by the show's advertisers if an apology and correction was not aired on All Saints the following week.<ref name=\"SevenApologises\"/>\n\nSeven responded with, \"''All Saints'' values its audience and has the greatest respect for their commitment to the program. Without reservation, to any members of the audience who have found an element of a recent story offensive, Channel Seven apologises.\"<ref name=\"SevenApologises\"/>\n\n=== The final episode ===\nThe longer-than-usual 49-minute episode aired at 9:30pm on Tuesday, 27 October 2009. The episode, unlike those in the rest of the season, went back to basics and focused more on the lives of the nurses and doctors as they tended to patients.\n\nThe episode saw [[Judith McGrath]]'s character, Von Ryan tending to a teenage girl who comes into the ED and gives birth without knowing she was pregnant. [[Tammy Macintosh]] and John Howard finished their seven- and five-year reigns as Dr. Charlotte Beaumont and Dr. Frank Campion respectively, caring for a woman played by [[Heather Mitchell]] who had cystic fibrosis. [[Ella Scott Lynch]] and [[Jonathan Wood]] left the show on a high with their characters, Claire Anderson and Elliott Parker treating a man ([[Luke Pegler]]) with a disease consistent with diabetes and promiscuity.\n\nSecretly, Von decides to resign from All Saints, telling only Frank that she wouldn't be returning. He offers to take her out for dinner, but instead plans a surprise farewell dinner for her. Throughout the dinner, Gabrielle ([[Virginia Gay]]) and Steve ([[Jack Campbell (actor)|Jack Campbell]]) decide to raise their child together and get back together, Bart ([[Andrew Supanz]]) proposes to his girlfriend Amy ([[Alix Bidstrup]]) and Charlotte and Adam ([[Kip Gamblin]]) share an intense moment.\n\nAt the table, Von is pressured to make a speech by her colleagues and friends and reluctantly, she does, uttering her famous line: \"I spent a lot of time at All Saints and I'd just like to thank you all for your loyalty, your support and love. Oh bugger this, here's to us.\" She raises her glass and toasts.\n\nThe finale is capped off by a montage of scenes from over the show's twelve-year run, including Mitch's final scene, the closure of Ward 17 and Bron & Ben's wedding, all to [[The Beatles]] song, \"[[In My Life]]\".\n\nThe final scene sees Frank raise his glass at Von, who raises hers and smiles.\n\n=== Opening credits ===\n\nThe first opening theme song for ''All Saints'' began with several deep breaths and then went into a tune played by a saxophone. The melody bears a striking similarity to \"Fly By Night\", the first track on [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] frontman [[Ian Anderson]]'s 1983 debut album ''[[Walk Into Light]]''. This played over the top of several shots of the cast members. Actors names were in the font [[Zurich (typeface)|Zurich Extra Condensed]] and underlined. Intercut were shots of hands, various medical equipment and medicine.\n\nThe second opening theme song was first used when the opening was upgraded in mid-season two. The same song was used however drums were added to give it more of an authentic sound. The shots of cast changed and names of actors and their characters were now present. The font remained the same. Shots of hands, medical vehicles and equipment were also present.\n\nThe first major overhaul of the opening happened in season four, when the titles were completely changed. They now began with several deep breaths over a blue screen with a vision of hands in the background. The screen was set up with a slide of the actor in the centre, with deep blue all around and medical notation. The theme was more stringy and only involved a small saxophone part. Medical crosses, bottles and syringes were present in the opening.\n\nThe second major overhaul of the opening happened in season seven, when the whole layout and font used were completely changed to mark the revamp of the show and its change of focus to the Emergency Department. The basic undertone of the theme was still there, however another saxophone overtone was added tho give the theme more authenticity. The images were also upgraded to include ambulances, surgical equipment and people rushing around in the background. The font changed and actors and characters were now in the font [[List of typefaces|Imprint MT Shadow]]. This set of opening titles continues until the end of season eight.\n\nAt the beginning of season nine, the opening titles credits were ditched and the main cast were listed at the last of every episode with the names returning to their original format and font. This continues until the final episode. In seasons ten and eleven, the actor's name and their corresponding character name flew in from either side, however this idea was dumped when the show returned for its final season.\n\nAn intertitle card appeared before every ad break in season nine, however the show returned to fading out in the tenth and eleventh seasons.\n\nAt the beginning of the eleventh season, a new title card premiered and this appeared at the start of every episode.\n\nThis title card was refurbished for the twelfth and final season to coincide with the change of name. This title card saw the show out.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\n\nThe show has been nominated for fifty six [[Logie award]]s and won nine.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Set in the fictional All Saints Western General Hospital, it focused on the staff of Ward 17 until its closure in 2004, which is when the focus changed and began following the staff of the Emergency Department. It was produced by John Holmes alongside Jo Porter, MaryAnne Carroll and Di Drew. The final episode aired on 27 October 2009, completing its recording-breaking 12-year run.\n\n== Plot ==\n''All Saints'' follows the lives of the staff at All Saints Western General Hospital. Until its closure in 2004, the show primarily focused on the staff in Ward 17. Known as the \"garbage ward\" as it took all the overflow from the other wards, Ward 17 was run by compassionate nun, Sister Terri Sullivan ([[Georgie Parker]]). Her staff included her nurses Connor Costello ([[Jeremy Cumpston]]), Von Ryan ([[Judith McGrath]]), Bronwyn Craig ([[Libby Tanner]]), Jared Levine ([[Ben Tari]]) and Stephanie Markham ([[Kirrily White]]) and her ward clerk Jaz Hillerman ([[Sam Healy]]). Luke Forlano ([[Martin Lynes]]) and Peter Morrison ([[Andrew McKaige]]) were doctors who frequently worked with Terri and her staff. Ben Markham ([[Brian Vriends]]) was an ambulance officer who worked closely with Luke, despite their rivalry. Bronwyn left Ward 17 and became an ambulance officer at the end of 1998 but returned to the ward full-time at the end of season 3.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main cast ===\n{| class=\"wikitable

something in response to considerable drop in ratings and to prolong the life of the series.<ref name=\"ED\"/>\n\nIn February 2004, John Holmes told [[The Age]] journalist Debi Enker that ''All Saints'' would be undergoing \"major surgery\" when the focus shifted from Ward 17 to the Emergency Department. He also stated that while four familiar faces will be leaving, new characters will be introduced to fill the void. Holmes recalled a statement that he made in May 2003 in which he said, \"we [myself and Seven script executive Bevan Lee] were seeing the scripts and watching episodes and we were feeling that there was a little bit of a sameness in it. We started to think, 'Don't know about this. Sixth year. Maybe we've had a few too many people through the door of Ward 17 on a trolley and had the 'Hi, I'm Von, I'm your nurse. Room Three, thanks Sterlo.'\" After tossing up between cancelling the show and using it as the foundation of a spin-off series, Holmes and Lee decided to rejuvenate the show by changing the setting. Ward 17 would then close and the show would be relocated to the Emergency Department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/extrememakeover.html|title=''All Saints'' gets an extreme makeover|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Age]]|last=Enker|first=Debi|date=19 February 2004|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the shift, several cast members decided to leave the show. Paula Morgan ([[Jenni Baird]]), Luke Forlano ([[Martin Lynes]]), Alex Kearns ([[Fletcher Humphrys]]) and Sterling McCormack ([[Henry Nixon]]) were all written out of the show. Former ''[[Always Greener]]'' star [[John Howard (Australian actor)|John Howard]] signed a three-year deal and was added to the cast as the cranky head of Emergency, Dr. Frank Campion. Other new faces included [[Wil Traval]] as Dr. Jack Quade, [[Mark Priestley]] and [[Natalie Saleeba]] as nurses Dan Goldman and Jessica Singleton and [[Alexandra Davies]] as ambulance officer Cate McMasters.<ref name=\"ED\">{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/fourstarsdumped.html|title=Four ''All Saints'' stars dumped|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Herald Sun]]|last=Byrne|first=Fiona|date=23 November 2003|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009 another attempt to stem the softening ratings and add a bit of excitement to the series, [[Seven Network]] executives decided to rejuvenate again, introducing a medical response unit to deal with tricky rescues which involved a helicopter going to remote locations to rescue patients who needed assistance. They would then bring those patients back to the ED and the staff there would assist in their treatment. Along with the addition of the new \"department\" the show was also renamed to ''All Saints: Medical Response Unit'', the introduction of [[Mirrah Foulkes]] and the new MRU proved to lift the ratings substantially, but then levelled out at where they were prior to the revamp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/trioaddenergy.html|title=MRU trio add energy injection to ''All Saints''|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Courier Mail]]|last=McWhirter|first=Erin|date=20 January 2009|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2009, after months of rumours that the cancellation of ''All Saints'' was imminent, a spokeswoman from the [[Seven Network]] informed [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] that the episode order had been trimmed. Season twelve of ''All Saints'' would screen 24 episodes instead of the usual 40 episodes and that production would cease in August instead of November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/allsaintsalive.html|title=All Saints alive, with a bit of surgery|publisher= Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 June 2009|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2009, exactly one month later after the first announcement, Tim Worner, Seven's Director of Programming at the time announced that ''All Saints'' had been cancelled. He told Michael Idato of the [[Sydney Morning Herald]], \"''All Saints'' is a show which Seven and viewers have loved. However, an audience shift and increased production costs are behind this tough decision.\" He also informed Idato that the episode order trim had been reverted and the season would complete a 37 episode order, finishing on episode 493. It was reported after the announcement that since the introduction of the MRU in 2009 it inflated the cost of each episode to $500,000. Many people still argue as to why the MRU was introduced in the first place or should have been removed instead of axing the show if the network was wanting to cut costs.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/tvcasualty.html|title=TV casualty: ''All Saints'' axed after 11 years|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|last=Idato|first=Michael|date=9 July 2009|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the Feb/Mar 2010 GQ magazine in 2010, Tim Worner said his one regret was \"Axing All Saints. But it was the right call at the time and we have two new drama projects in development.\"\n\n=== Controversy ===\n\n==== Episode 265 ====\nOn 20 April 2004, episode 265, \"Brave New World\" aired, which saw the introduction of [[John Howard (Australian actor)|John Howard]]'s character, Frank Campion. It was also the first episode to be set in the Emergency Department. This episode attracted lots of controversy.\n\nOne patient came into the triage and tried to get help, but he was told to wait. Later on, Nelson heard a phone ring coming from the patient and asked him to turn off the phone. It was later hinted that he had been using the phone to masturbate and it had gotten stuck in his rectum.\n\nThe end of the episode saw Frank go introduce himself to Terri ([[Georgie Parker]]), who was recovering from heart surgery. During a heated argument about staff members, Frank blatantly said to Terri, \"if you ever use your influence with your previous employees to white-ant me again, you will never work in Emergency.\" Before Terri could get a word in, Frank added, \"can I make it any fucking clearer?\"<ref name=\"Not So Saintly\">{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/notsosaintly.html|title=My sainted aunt! F-words and a lost mobile|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Courier Mail]]|last=Chalmers|first=Emma|date=22 April 2004|accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe next day, [[Channel 7 Australia|Channel Seven]] announced that they had received more than 100 phone calls in Melbourne alone. Parker told the media, \"it's a good response because it's not about the shock words\u2014we've sworn on the show before\u2014but because people clearly feel really protective about Terri. It's like they really feel for her as a character and don't like her being under attack by a very confronting man. It's great to know they care for her so much.\"<ref name=\"Not So Saintly\"/>\n\nOn 22 April, the network issued a statement that read, \"within an M classification code, coarse language is permitted provided it is appropriate to the storyline or program context.\" An apology was not made.<ref name=\"Not So Saintly\"/>\n\n==== Episode 432 ====\nOn 27 May 2008, episode 432, \"Never Tell\" aired.\n\nThis episode saw a woman pregnant from an incestuous relationship with her brother, told her child may have Down syndrome as a result.\n\nLeading geneticist Dr. David Amor of Murdoch Children's Research Institute stated, \"There is absolutely no increase in the risk of Down syndrome for the offspring of incestuous relationships.\"<ref name=\"SevenApologises\">{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/sevenapologises.html|title=Seven apologises for incest episode|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Age]]|last=Ricketson|first=Matthew|date=3 June 2008|accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nDown Syndrome Australia considered legal action, complained to the media regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority and called for a boycott by the show's advertisers if an apology and correction was not aired on All Saints the following week.<ref name=\"SevenApologises\"/>\n\nSeven responded with, \"''All Saints'' values its audience and has the greatest respect for their commitment to the program. Without reservation, to any members of the audience who have found an element of a recent story offensive, Channel Seven apologises.\"<ref name=\"SevenApologises\"/>\n\n=== The final episode ===\nThe longer-than-usual 49-minute episode aired at 9:30pm on Tuesday, 27 October 2009. The episode, unlike those in the rest of the season, went back to basics and focused more on the lives of the nurses and doctors as they tended to patients.\n\nThe episode saw [[Judith McGrath]]'s character, Von Ryan tending to a teenage girl who comes into the ED and gives birth without knowing she was pregnant. [[Tammy Macintosh]] and John Howard finished their seven- and five-year reigns as Dr. Charlotte Beaumont and Dr. Frank Campion respectively, caring for a woman played by [[Heather Mitchell]] who had cystic fibrosis. [[Ella Scott Lynch]] and [[Jonathan Wood]] left the show on a high with their characters, Claire Anderson and Elliott Parker treating a man ([[Luke Pegler]]) with a disease consistent with diabetes and promiscuity.\n\nSecretly, Von decides to resign from All Saints, telling only Frank that she wouldn't be returning. He offers to take her out for dinner, but instead plans a surprise farewell dinner for her. Throughout the dinner, Gabrielle ([[Virginia Gay]]) and Steve ([[Jack Campbell (actor)|Jack Campbell]]) decide to raise their child together and get back together, Bart ([[Andrew Supanz]]) proposes to his girlfriend Amy ([[Alix Bidstrup]]) and Charlotte and Adam ([[Kip Gamblin]]) share an intense moment.\n\nAt the table, Von is pressured to make a speech by her colleagues and friends and reluctantly, she does, uttering her famous line: \"I spent a lot of time at All Saints and I'd just like to thank you all for your loyalty, your support and love. Oh bugger this, here's to us.\" She raises her glass and toasts.\n\nThe finale is capped off by a montage of scenes from over the show's twelve-year run, including Mitch's final scene, the closure of Ward 17 and Bron & Ben's wedding, all to [[The Beatles]] song, \"[[In My Life]]\".\n\nThe final scene sees Frank raise his glass at Von, who raises hers and smiles.\n\n=== Opening credits ===\n\nThe first opening theme song for ''All Saints'' began with several deep breaths and then went into a tune played by a saxophone. The melody bears a striking similarity to \"Fly By Night\", the first track on [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] frontman [[Ian Anderson]]'s 1983 debut album ''[[Walk Into Light]]''. This played over the top of several shots of the cast members. Actors names were in the font [[Zurich (typeface)|Zurich Extra Condensed]] and underlined. Intercut were shots of hands, various medical equipment and medicine.\n\nThe second opening theme song was first used when the opening was upgraded in mid-season two. The same song was used however drums were added to give it more of an authentic sound. The shots of cast changed and names of actors and their characters were now present. The font remained the same. Shots of hands, medical vehicles and equipment were also present.\n\nThe first major overhaul of the opening happened in season four, when the titles were completely changed. They now began with several deep breaths over a blue screen with a vision of hands in the background. The screen was set up with a slide of the actor in the centre, with deep blue all around and medical notation. The theme was more stringy and only involved a small saxophone part. Medical crosses, bottles and syringes were present in the opening.\n\nThe second major overhaul of the opening happened in season seven, when the whole layout and font used were completely changed to mark the revamp of the show and its change of focus to the Emergency Department. The basic undertone of the theme was still there, however another saxophone overtone was added tho give the theme more authenticity. The images were also upgraded to include ambulances, surgical equipment and people rushing around in the background. The font changed and actors and characters were now in the font [[List of typefaces|Imprint MT Shadow]]. This set of opening titles continues until the end of season eight.\n\nAt the beginning of season nine, the opening titles credits were ditched and the main cast were listed at the last of every episode with the names returning to their original format and font. This continues until the final episode. In seasons ten and eleven, the actor\u2019s name and their corresponding character name flew in from either side, however this idea was dumped when the show returned for its final season.\n\nAn intertitle card appeared before every ad break in season nine, however the show returned to fading out in the tenth and eleventh seasons.\n\nAt the beginning of the eleventh season, a new title card premiered and this appeared at the start of every episode.\n\nThis title card was refurbished for the twelfth and final season to coincide with the change of name. This title card saw the show out.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\n\nThe show has been nominated for fifty six [[Logie award]]s and won nine.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
