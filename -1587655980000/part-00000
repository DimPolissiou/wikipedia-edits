No [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling.\n\nIn theory, a particle and its anti-particle (for example, proton and antiproton) have the same mass, but opposite [[electric charge]] and other differences in [[quantum number]]s. For example, a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge.\n\nA collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner leads to their ''mutual [[annihilation]]'', giving rise to various proportions of intense [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s), [[neutrino]]s, and sometimes less-massive particle-antiparticle pairs. The majority of the total energy of annihilation emerges in the form of [[ionizing radiation]]. If surrounding matter is present, the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy such as heat or light.

For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.\n\n==Properties==\nThere are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric and baryon charges), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties.<ref>\n{{Cite arXiv\n |last1=Dolgov |first1=A.

They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter.

They point out that, in 2004, the annual production of antiprotons at [[CERN]] was several picograms at a cost of $20 million. This means that to produce 1&nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.\n\nAntimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.\n\nStorage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge, they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons . The drawback is that cold antihydrogen is far more complex to produce than mere antiprotons.\n\nOne researcher from the CERN laboratories, which produces antimatter regularly, said:\n{{quote|If we could assemble all of the antimatter we've ever made at CERN and annihilate it with matter, we would have enough energy to light a single electric light bulb for a few minutes.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |year=2004 [2008]\n |title=Angels and Demons: Do antimatter atoms exist?\n |url=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |publisher=[[CERN]]\n |accessdate=2010-11-18\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160609/http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |url-status=dead\n |archivedate=2010-11-16\n}}</ref>}}\n--->\n\n===Weapons===\n{{Main|Antimatter weapon}}\n\nAntimatter has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |title=Antimatter weapons\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424174413/http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |archivedate=24 April 2013\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref> A major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities, and there is no evidence that it will ever be feasible.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last1=Gsponer |first1=Andre\n |last2=Hurni |first2=Jean-Pierre\n |year=1987\n |chapter=The physics of antimatter induced fusion and thermonuclear explosions\n |editor1-last=Velarde |editor1-first=G.\n |editor2-last=Minguez |editor2-first=E.\n |title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems, Madrid, June/July, 1986\n |volume=4 |issue=30 |pages=66\u2013169\n |publisher=[[World Scientific]]\n |arxiv=physics/0507114\n |bibcode=2005physics...7114G\n}}</ref> However, the U.S. Air Force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the [[Cold War]], and began considering its possible use in weapons, not just as a trigger, but as the explosive itself.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/10/04/MNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |title=Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons / Program was touted publicly, then came official gag order\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609101650/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F10%2F04%2FMNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |archivedate=9 June 2012\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Antimatter comet}}\n* {{annotated link|Plasma cosmology#Alfv\u00e9n\u2013Klein cosmology}}\n* {{annotated link|Gravitational interaction of antimatter}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=G.

For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.\n\n==Properties==\nThere are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric and baryon charges), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties.<ref>\n{{Cite arXiv\n |last1=Dolgov |first1=A.

High-energy [[cosmic ray]]s impacting [[Earth's atmosphere]] (or any other matter in the [[Solar System]]) produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting [[particle jet]]s, which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter. They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter.

While electron\u2013positron reactions result in gamma ray photons, these are difficult to direct and use for thrust. In reactions between protons and antiprotons, their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged [[pion]]s.

They point out that, in 2004, the annual production of antiprotons at [[CERN]] was several picograms at a cost of $20 million. This means that to produce 1&nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.\n\nAntimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.\n\nStorage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge, they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons . The drawback is that cold antihydrogen is far more complex to produce than mere antiprotons.\n\nOne researcher from the CERN laboratories, which produces antimatter regularly, said:\n{{quote|If we could assemble all of the antimatter we've ever made at CERN and annihilate it with matter, we would have enough energy to light a single electric light bulb for a few minutes.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |year=2004 [2008]\n |title=Angels and Demons: Do antimatter atoms exist?\n |url=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |publisher=[[CERN]]\n |accessdate=2010-11-18\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160609/http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |url-status=dead\n |archivedate=2010-11-16\n}}</ref>}}\n--->\n\n===Weapons===\n{{Main|Antimatter weapon}}\n\nAntimatter has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |title=Antimatter weapons\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424174413/http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |archivedate=24 April 2013\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref> A major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities, and there is no evidence that it will ever be feasible.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last1=Gsponer |first1=Andre\n |last2=Hurni |first2=Jean-Pierre\n |year=1987\n |chapter=The physics of antimatter induced fusion and thermonuclear explosions\n |editor1-last=Velarde |editor1-first=G.\n |editor2-last=Minguez |editor2-first=E.\n |title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems, Madrid, June/July, 1986\n |volume=4 |issue=30 |pages=66\u2013169\n |publisher=[[World Scientific]]\n |arxiv=physics/0507114\n |bibcode=2005physics...7114G\n}}</ref> However, the U.S. Air Force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the [[Cold War]], and began considering its possible use in weapons, not just as a trigger, but as the explosive itself.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/10/04/MNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |title=Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons / Program was touted publicly, then came official gag order\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609101650/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F10%2F04%2FMNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |archivedate=9 June 2012\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Antimatter comet}}\n* {{annotated link|Plasma cosmology#Alfv\u00e9n\u2013Klein cosmology}}\n* {{annotated link|Gravitational interaction of antimatter}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=G.

Zion has confirmed [[The_Animatrix#Final Flight of the Osiris|the last transmission of the ''Osiris'']]: an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Lock|Commander Lock]] orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught, but Morpheus asks one ship to remain to contact the [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]]. As the ''Caduceus'' receives a message from the Oracle, one of the ''Caduceus'' crew, [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]], encounters [[Agent Smith|Smith]], who reveals that his previous encounter with Neo severed his connection with the Matrix and is now a rogue program, then absorbs his avatar. Smith then uses the phone line to leave the Matrix and gain control of Bane's real body.\n\nIn Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. In the Matrix, Neo meets the Oracle's bodyguard [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]], who leads him to her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that this is his decision. The Oracle instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix with the help of the [[Keymaker (The Matrix)|Keymaker]]. As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated, he refused to be deleted and is now a rogue program. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other inhabitants of the Matrix, including other Agents, as hosts. He then tries to absorb Neo but fails, prompting a battle between Smith's clones and Neo. Neo manages to defend himself, but is forced to retreat from the increasingly overwhelming numbers.\n\nNeo, Morpheus, and Trinity visit the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]], who is imprisoning the Keymaker. The Merovingian, a rogue Matrix program with his own agenda, refuses to let him go. His wife [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]], seeking revenge on her husband for his infidelity, leads the trio to the Keymaker. Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker flee while Neo holds off the Merovingian's henchmen. Morpheus and Trinity try to escape with the Keymaker, pursued by several Agents and the Merovingian's chief henchmen, [[Twins (The Matrix)|the Twins]]. After a long chase, Trinity escapes, Morpheus defeats the Twins, and Neo saves Morpheus and the Keymaker from Agent Johnson.\n\nThe crews of the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', ''Vigilant'', and ''Logos'' help the Keymaker and Neo reach the Source. The ''Logos'' crew must destroy a power plant and the ''Vigilant'' crew must disable a back-up power station, to prevent a security system from being triggered, allowing Neo to open the door to the Source. Haunted by a vision of Trinity's death, Neo asks her to remain on the ''Nebuchadnezzar''.\n\nThe ''Logos'' succeeds, while the ''Vigilant'' is destroyed by a Sentinel, killing everyone on board. Trinity replaces the ''Vigilant'' crew and completes their mission. However, Agent Thompson corners her and they fight. As Neo, Morpheus, and the Keymaker try to reach the Source, the Smiths ambush them. The Keymaker unlocks the door to the Source, but the Smiths shoot him dead as he closes the door.\n\nNeo meets a program called the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]], the creator of the Matrix. The Architect explains that Neo is himself a program and an intentional part of the Matrix, which is now in its sixth iteration. Neo is meant to stop the Matrix's fatal system crash that naturally recurs due to the concept of human choice within it. As with the five previous Ones, Neo has a choice: either return to the Source to reboot the Matrix and pick survivors to repopulate the soon-to-be-destroyed Zion, as his predecessors all did, or cause the Matrix to crash and kill everyone connected to it, which would mean humanity's extinction when Zion is destroyed. Neo learns of Trinity's situation and chooses to save her instead of returning to the Source, to which the Architect responds dismissively.\n\nTrinity is shot as she and Agent Thompson fall off a building. Before she hits the ground, Neo catches her. He then removes the bullet from her heart and revives her. They return to the real world, where Sentinels attack them. The ''Nebuchadnezzar'' is destroyed, but the crew escape. Neo displays a new ability to disable the machines with his thoughts, but falls into a coma from the effort. The crew are picked up by another ship, the ''Hammer''. Its captain, Roland, reveals the other ships were wiped out by the machines after someone activated an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] too early, and that they found only one survivor: the Smith-possessed Bane.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as [[Agent Smith]]\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]]\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Link\n* [[Randall Duk Kim]] as [[Keymaker|The Keymaker]]\n* [[Gloria Foster]] as [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]]\n* [[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]]\n* [[Lambert Wilson]] as The Merovingian\n* [[Helmut Bakaitis]] as [[Architect (The Matrix)|The Architect]]\n* Neil and Adrian Rayment as [[Twins (The Matrix)|Twins]]\n* [[Daniel Bernhardt]] as Agent Johnson\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as Axel\n* [[Collin Chou]] as [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]]\n* [[Nona Gaye]] as Zee\n* [[Gina Torres]] as Cas\n* Donald Anjaya Batte as Vector\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as Councillor Hamann\n* [[Roy Jones Jr.]] as Captain Ballard\n* David A.

The [[freeway]] chase and \"Burly Brawl\" scenes were filmed at the decommissioned [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] in [[Alameda, California]]. The producers constructed a 1.5-mile freeway on the old runways specifically for the film. Some portions of the chase were also filmed in [[Oakland, California]], and the tunnel shown briefly is the [[Webster Tube]], which connects Oakland and Alameda. Some post-production editing was also done in old aircraft hangars on the base. The city of [[Akron, Ohio]] was willing to give full access to [[Ohio State Route 59|Route 59]], the stretch of freeway known as the \"Innerbelt\", for filming of the freeway chase when it was under consideration. However, producers decided against this as \"the time to reset all the cars in their start position would take too long\".<ref name=job>{{cite web |url=http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=4021949&src=News |title=Chasing the Stars: Carmakers in Movies |publisher=MSN.com |first=Ann |last=Job |accessdate=2005-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306233023/http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=4021949&src=News |archive-date=March 6, 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[MythBusters]]'' would later reuse the Alameda location in order to explore the effects of a head-on collision between two semi trucks, and to perform various other experiments.

To develop technologies for the film, Warner Bros. launched ESC Entertainment.<ref name=\"Wired VFX\" >{{cite magazine | url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html | title=Matrix<sup>2</sup> | magazine=Wired | accessdate=December 25, 2012 | author=Silberman, Steve}}</ref> The ESC team tried to figure out how to bring the Wachowskis' vision to the screen, but because bullet time required arrays of carefully aligned cameras and months of planning, even for a brief scene featuring two or three actors, a scene like the Burly Brawl seemed almost impossible as envisioned and could take years to composite. Eventually [[John Gaeta]] realized that the technology he and his crew had developed for ''The Matrix''{{'}}s [[bullet time]] was no longer sufficient and concluded they needed a [[virtuality|virtual]] [[camera]] (in other words, a [[simulation]] of a camera). Having before used real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models in ''The Matrix'', the team started digitizing all data, such as scenes, characters' motions, or even the reflectivity of Neo's [[cassock]]. The [[reflection (computer graphics)|reflectivity]] of objects needs to be [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|captured and simulated adequately]] and [[Paul Debevec]] et al. captured the reflectance of the [[human face]] and Borshukov's work was strongly based on the findings of Debevec et al. They developed \"Universal Capture\", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution, then capture expressions from Reeves and Weaving using [[Motion capture#Markerless|dense aka. markerless capture]] and [[multi-camera setup]] (similar to the bullet time rig) [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] capture [[Art techniques and materials|technique]] called [[optical flow]].<ref name=\"Deb2005\">{{cite book | last = Debevec | first = Paul | authorlink = |author2=J.

With this collected wealth of data and the right algorithms, they finally were able to create [[virtual cinematography]] in which characters, locations, and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras, years of compositing data, and replacing the use of still camera arrays or, in some scenes, cameras altogether. The ESC team rendered the final effects using the program [[mental ray]].<ref name=\"Wired VFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|The Matrix Reloaded: The Album|The Matrix Reloaded (score)}}\n[[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]], who composed for ''The Matrix'', returned to score ''Reloaded''. For many of the pivotal action sequences, such as the \"Burly Brawl\", he collaborated with [[Juno Reactor]]. Some of the collaborative cues by Davis and Juno Reactor are extensions of material by Juno Reactor; for example, a version of \"Komit\" featuring Davis' strings is used during a flying sequence, and \"Burly Brawl\" is essentially a combination of Davis' unused \"Multiple Replication\" and a piece similar to Juno Reactor's \"Masters of the Universe\". One of the collaborations, \"[[Mona Lisa Overdrive (song)|Mona Lisa Overdrive]]\", is titled in reference to the [[cyberpunk]] [[Mona Lisa Overdrive|novel of the same name]] by [[William Gibson]], a major influence on the directors.\n\n[[Leitmotif]]s established in ''The Matrix'' return \u2014 such as the Matrix main theme, Neo and Trinity's love theme, the Sentinel's theme, Neo's flying theme, and a more frequent use of the four-note Agent Smith theme \u2014 and others used in ''Revolutions'' are established.\n\nAs with its predecessor, many tracks by external musicians are featured in the movie, its closing credits, and the soundtrack album, some of which were written for the film. Many of the musicians featured, for example [[Rob Zombie]], [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], had also appeared on the soundtrack for ''The Matrix''. [[Rob Dougan]] also re-contributed, licensing the instrumental version of \"[[Furious Angels]]\", as well as being commissioned to provide an original track, ultimately scoring the battle in the Merovingian's chateau. A remixed version of \"[[Slap It (Fluke song)|Slap It]]\" by electronic artist [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]] \u2014 listed on the soundtrack as \"Zion\" \u2014 was used during the rave scene.\n\n[[Linkin Park]] contributed their instrumental song \"Session\" to the film as well, although it did not appear during the course of the film. [[P.O.D.]] composed a song called \"[[Sleeping Awake]]\", with a [[music video]] which focused heavily on Neo, as well as many images that were part of the film. Both songs played during the film's credits.\n\nIt was originally planned for the electronic band [[R\u00f6yksopp]] to create the soundtrack, but this offer was turned down.<ref>\"[http://www.fib.no/en/News-2015/Kafka-feat-Royksopp-at-the-Bergen-International-Festival/ Kafka feat.

''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', which continues the story, was released six months after ''Reloaded'', in November 2003.\n\n==Plot==\nSix months after the events of ''[[The Matrix]]'', [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] and [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] are now romantically involved. [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] receives a message from Captain [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]] of the ''Logos'' calling an emergency meeting of all ships of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]]. Zion has confirmed [[The_Animatrix#Final Flight of the Osiris|the last transmission of the ''Osiris'']]: an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Lock|Commander Lock]] orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught, but Morpheus asks one ship to remain to contact the [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]]. As the ''Caduceus'' receives a message from the Oracle, one of the ''Caduceus'' crew, [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]], encounters [[Agent Smith|Smith]], who reveals that his previous encounter with Neo severed his connection with the Matrix and has made him a rogue program, then absorbs his avatar. Smith then uses the phone line to leave the Matrix and gain control of Bane's real body.\n\nIn Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. In the Matrix, Neo meets the Oracle's bodyguard [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]], who leads him to her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that this is his decision. The Oracle instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix with the help of the [[Keymaker (The Matrix)|Keymaker]]. As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated, he refused to be deleted and is now a rogue program. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other inhabitants of the Matrix, including other Agents, as hosts. He then tries to absorb Neo but fails, prompting a battle between Smith's clones and Neo. Neo manages to defend himself, but is forced to retreat from the increasingly overwhelming numbers.\n\nNeo, Morpheus, and Trinity visit the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]], who is imprisoning the Keymaker. The Merovingian, a rogue Matrix program with his own agenda, refuses to let him go. His wife [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]], seeking revenge on her husband for his infidelity, leads the trio to the Keymaker. Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker flee while Neo holds off the Merovingian's henchmen. Morpheus and Trinity try to escape with the Keymaker, pursued by several Agents and the Merovingian's chief henchmen, [[Twins (The Matrix)|the Twins]]. After a long chase, Trinity escapes, Morpheus defeats the Twins, and Neo saves Morpheus and the Keymaker from Agent Johnson.\n\nThe crews of the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', ''Vigilant'', and ''Logos'' help the Keymaker and Neo reach the Source. The ''Logos'' crew must destroy a power plant and the ''Vigilant'' crew must disable a back-up power station, to prevent a security system from being triggered, allowing Neo to open the door to the Source. Haunted by a vision of Trinity's death, Neo asks her to remain on the ''Nebuchadnezzar''.\n\nThe ''Logos'' succeeds, while the ''Vigilant'' is destroyed by a Sentinel, killing everyone on board. Trinity replaces the ''Vigilant'' crew and completes their mission. However, Agent Thompson corners her and they fight. As Neo, Morpheus, and the Keymaker try to reach the Source, the Smiths ambush them. The Keymaker unlocks the door to the Source, but the Smiths shoot him dead as he closes the door.\n\nNeo meets a program called the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]], the creator of the Matrix. The Architect explains that Neo is himself a program and an intentional part of the Matrix, which is now in its sixth iteration. Neo is meant to stop the Matrix's fatal system crash that naturally recurs due to the concept of human choice within it. As with the five previous Ones, Neo has a choice: either return to the Source to reboot the Matrix and pick survivors to repopulate the soon-to-be-destroyed Zion, as his predecessors all did, or cause the Matrix to crash and kill everyone connected to it, which would mean humanity's extinction when Zion is destroyed. Neo learns of Trinity's situation and chooses to save her instead of returning to the Source, to which the Architect responds dismissively.\n\nTrinity is shot as she and Agent Thompson fall off a building. Before she hits the ground, Neo catches her. He then removes the bullet from her heart and revives her. They return to the real world, where Sentinels attack them. The ''Nebuchadnezzar'' is destroyed, but the crew escape. Neo displays a new ability to disable the machines with his thoughts, but falls into a coma from the effort. The crew are picked up by another ship, the ''Hammer''. Its captain, Roland, reveals the other ships were wiped out by the machines after someone activated an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] too early, and that they found only one survivor: the Smith-possessed Bane.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as [[Agent Smith]]\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]]\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Link\n* [[Randall Duk Kim]] as [[Keymaker|The Keymaker]]\n* [[Gloria Foster]] as [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]]\n* [[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]]\n* [[Lambert Wilson]] as The Merovingian\n* [[Helmut Bakaitis]] as [[Architect (The Matrix)|The Architect]]\n* Neil and Adrian Rayment as [[Twins (The Matrix)|Twins]]\n* [[Daniel Bernhardt]] as Agent Johnson\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as Axel\n* [[Collin Chou]] as [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]]\n* [[Nona Gaye]] as Zee\n* [[Gina Torres]] as Cas\n* Donald Anjaya Batte as Vector\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as Councillor Hamann\n* [[Roy Jones Jr.]] as Captain Ballard\n* David A.

The [[freeway]] chase and \"Burly Brawl\" scenes were filmed at the decommissioned [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] in [[Alameda, California]]. The producers constructed a 1.5-mile freeway on the old runways specifically for the film. Some portions of the chase were also filmed in [[Oakland, California]], and the tunnel shown briefly is the [[Webster Tube]], which connects Oakland and Alameda. Some post-production editing was also done in old aircraft hangars on the base. The city of [[Akron, Ohio]] was willing to give full access to [[Ohio State Route 59|Route 59]], the stretch of freeway known as the \"Innerbelt\", for filming of the freeway chase when it was under consideration.

To develop technologies for the film, Warner Bros. launched ESC Entertainment.<ref name=\"Wired VFX\" >{{cite magazine | url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html | title=Matrix<sup>2</sup> | magazine=Wired | accessdate=December 25, 2012 | author=Silberman, Steve}}</ref> The ESC team tried to figure out how to bring the Wachowskis' vision to the screen, but because bullet time required arrays of carefully aligned cameras and months of planning, even for a brief scene featuring two or three actors, a scene like the Burly Brawl seemed almost impossible as envisioned and could take years to composite. Eventually [[John Gaeta]] realized that the technology he and his crew had developed for ''The Matrix''{{'}}s [[bullet time]] was no longer sufficient and concluded they needed a [[virtuality|virtual]] [[camera]] (in other words, a [[simulation]] of a camera). Having before used real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models in ''The Matrix'', the team started digitizing all data, such as scenes, characters' motions, or even the reflectivity of Neo's [[cassock]]. The [[reflection (computer graphics)|reflectivity]] of objects needs to be [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|captured and simulated adequately]] and [[Paul Debevec]] et al. captured the reflectance of the [[human face]] and Borshukov's work was strongly based on the findings of Debevec et al. They developed \"Universal Capture\", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution, then capture expressions from Reeves and Weaving using [[Motion capture#Markerless|dense aka. markerless capture]] and [[multi-camera setup]] (similar to the bullet time rig) [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] capture [[Art techniques and materials|technique]] called [[optical flow]].<ref name=\"Deb2005\">{{cite book | last = Debevec | first = Paul | authorlink = |author2=J.

With this collected wealth of data and the right algorithms, they finally were able to create [[virtual cinematography]] in which characters, locations, and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras, years of compositing data, and replacing the use of still camera arrays or, in some scenes, cameras altogether. The ESC team rendered the final effects using the program [[mental ray]].<ref name=\"Wired VFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|The Matrix Reloaded: The Album|The Matrix Reloaded (score)}}\n[[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]], who composed for ''The Matrix'', returned to score ''Reloaded''. For many of the pivotal action sequences, such as the \"Burly Brawl\", he collaborated with [[Juno Reactor]]. Some of the collaborative cues by Davis and Juno Reactor are extensions of material by Juno Reactor; for example, a version of \"Komit\" featuring Davis' strings is used during a flying sequence, and \"Burly Brawl\" is essentially a combination of Davis' unused \"Multiple Replication\" and a piece similar to Juno Reactor's \"Masters of the Universe\". One of the collaborations, \"[[Mona Lisa Overdrive (song)|Mona Lisa Overdrive]]\", is titled in reference to the [[cyberpunk]] [[Mona Lisa Overdrive|novel of the same name]] by [[William Gibson]], a major influence on the directors.\n\n[[Leitmotif]]s established in ''The Matrix'' return \u2014 such as the Matrix main theme, Neo and Trinity's love theme, the Sentinel's theme, Neo's flying theme, and a more frequent use of the four-note Agent Smith theme \u2014 and others used in ''Revolutions'' are established.\n\nAs with its predecessor, many tracks by external musicians are featured in the movie, its closing credits, and the soundtrack album, some of which were written for the film. Many of the musicians featured, for example [[Rob Zombie]], [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], had also appeared on the soundtrack for ''The Matrix''. [[Rob Dougan]] also re-contributed, licensing the instrumental version of \"[[Furious Angels]]\", as well as being commissioned to provide an original track, ultimately scoring the battle in the Merovingian's chateau. A remixed version of \"[[Slap It (Fluke song)|Slap It]]\" by electronic artist [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]] \u2014 listed on the soundtrack as \"Zion\" \u2014 was used during the rave scene.\n\n[[Linkin Park]] contributed their instrumental song \"Session\" to the film as well, although it did not appear during the course of the film. [[P.O.D.]] composed a song called \"[[Sleeping Awake]]\", with a [[music video]] which focused heavily on Neo, as well as many images that were part of the film. Both songs played during the film's credits.\n\nIt was originally planned for the electronic band [[R\u00f6yksopp]] to create the soundtrack, but this offer was turned down.<ref>\"[http://www.fib.no/en/News-2015/Kafka-feat-Royksopp-at-the-Bergen-International-Festival/ Kafka feat.

In 1873, prospectors from the [[Bradshaw Mountains]] found gold in the town.  The town is named for the cave next to the creek the town was founded on.<ref>https://cavecreekmuseum.org/the-history-of-cave-creek/</ref><ref>https://www.dflt.org/a-short-history-of-cave-creek</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCave Creek is a town in the [[Sonoran Desert]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|28.2|sqmi|km2}}, all land.  It is adjacent to the town of [[Carefree, Arizona|Carefree]], and shares local landmark [[Black Mountain Carefree and Cave Creek Arizona|Black Mountain]] with Carefree.\n\nThere are two notable streams known as Cave Creek in Arizona. One flows through the Town of Cave Creek and into Phoenix. This may be the origin of the town's name. The other Cave Creek (Cave Creek Canyon) is in the Chiricahua Mountains, 200 miles to the southeast.\n\nIn 2000, the state of Arizona, [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], and the town of Cave Creek bought Spur Cross Ranch, a {{convert|2154|acre|km2|adj=on}} tract of Sonoran desert just north of Phoenix, for $21 million.  It had unusual cacti, stone formations, and hundreds of pre-history Hohokam Indian tribal artifacts, and is now a [[Maricopa County]] park.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 27, 2008 |title=McCain pushed regulators for land swap, despite pledge |author=Greg Gordon |work=McClatchy Newspapers |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/254/story/54851.html |access-date=October 28, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030065210/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/254/story/54851.html |archive-date=October 30, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nThe hot season lasts for 3.6 months, from May 31 to September 19, with an average daily high temperature above 93&nbsp;\u00b0F.

The largest city it borders is [[Phoenix, Arizona]].<ref>https://www.arizona-leisure.com/gfx/maps/valley-sun-map-760.gif</ref> According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of the town was 5,015.\n\n==History==\nCave Creek was settled in 1870 by soldiers on horseback from [[Fort McDowell, Arizona|Fort McDowell]].  In 1873, prospectors from the [[Bradshaw Mountains]] found gold in the town.  The town is named for the cave next to the creek the town was founded on.<ref>https://cavecreekmuseum.org/the-history-of-cave-creek/</ref><ref>https://www.dflt.org/a-short-history-of-cave-creek</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCave Creek is a town in the [[Sonoran Desert]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|28.2|sqmi|km2}}, all land.  It is adjacent to the town of [[Carefree, Arizona|Carefree]], and shares local landmark [[Black Mountain Carefree and Cave Creek Arizona|Black Mountain]] with Carefree.\n\nThere are two notable streams known as Cave Creek in Arizona. One flows through the Town of Cave Creek and into Phoenix. This may be the origin of the town's name. The other Cave Creek (Cave Creek Canyon) is in the Chiricahua Mountains, 200 miles to the southeast.\n\nIn 2000, the state of Arizona, [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], and the town of Cave Creek bought Spur Cross Ranch, a {{convert|2154|acre|km2|adj=on}} tract of Sonoran desert just north of Phoenix, for $21 million.  It had unusual cacti, stone formations, and hundreds of pre-history Hohokam Indian tribal artifacts, and is now a [[Maricopa County]] park.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 27, 2008 |title=McCain pushed regulators for land swap, despite pledge |author=Greg Gordon |work=McClatchy Newspapers |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/254/story/54851.html |access-date=October 28, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030065210/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/254/story/54851.html |archive-date=October 30, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nThe hot season lasts for 3.6 months, from May 31 to September 19, with an average daily high temperature above 93&nbsp;\u00b0F.

The drawing of playing cards led to the victory of 25-year-old law student Adam Trenk over incumbent Town Council member Thomas McGuire.
