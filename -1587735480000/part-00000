Artists are often invited or selected through a formal process, for a residency from a few weeks to over a year. Beginning with the early 20th century models, such as [[MacDowell Colony]] and [[Yaddo]], hundreds of modern-day artist colonies now offer the benefit of time, space, and collaborative time away from the usual workaday world. Worldwide, the two primary organizations serving artist colonies and residential centres are [[Res Artis]], based in [[Amsterdam]], and the [[Alliance of Artists Communities]], based in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. The [[Intra Asia Network]], based in [[Taiwan]], is a less formal body working to advance creative communities and exchanges throughout [[Asia]]. These consortia comprise most of the world's active artists' colonies.\n\nThe art movement itself has only started to be investigated by scholars, with the chief historical studies consisting of Michael Jacobs's introductory ''The Good and Simple Life''<ref>{{cite book|author=Jacobs, Michael|title=The Good and Simple Life: Artist Colonies in Europe and America|url=https://archive.org/details/goodsimplelifear00jaco|url-access=registration|publisher=Phaedon|year=1985|id=}}</ref> and Nina L\u00fcbbren's ''Artists\u2019 Colonies in Europe 1870-1910''.<ref name=\"Lubbren\">{{cite book|author=L\u00fcbbren, Nina|title=Rural Artists' Colonies in Europe 1870-1910|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2001|id=}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Formative period in Europe==\nArt colonies initially emerged as village movements in the 19th and early 20th century. It is estimated that between 1830 and 1914 some 3,000 professional artists participated in a mass movement away from urban centres into the countryside, residing for varying lengths of time in over eighty communities. There seem to have been three chief forms of these settlements, consisting of\n\n*villages with transient and annually fluctuating populations of artists\u2014mostly painters who visited for just a single summer season (such as [[Honfleur]], [[Giverny#The Giverny Colony|Giverny]], [[Katwijk]], [[Frauenchiemsee]], [[Volendam]], and [[Willingshausen]]);\n*villages with a semi-permanent mix of visiting and resident artists ([[Ahrenshoop]], [[Barbizon]], [[Concarneau]], [[Dachau art colony|Dachau]], [[St Ives, Cornwall|St. Ives]], [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]], and [[Skagen]]); and\n*villages in which a largely stable group of artists decided to settle permanently ([[Egmond (municipality)|Egmond]], [[Sint-Martens-Latem]], [[Newlyn]], and [[Worpswede#Artistic community|Worpswede]]).\n\nIn the latter villages, artists invariably bought or built their own houses and studios.\n\nWhile artist colonies appeared across Europe, as well as in America and Australia, L\u00fcbbren has found that the majority of colonies were clustered in the Netherlands, Central Germany, and France (encircling Paris). Overall, artists of thirty-five different nationalities were represented throughout these colonies, with Americans, Germans and British forming the largest participating groups. This gave socialising a cosmopolitan flavour: 'Russia, Sweden, England, Austria, Germany, France, Australia and the United States were represented at our table, all as one large family, and striving towards the same goal,' the painter Annie Goater penned in 1885 in an essay on her recent experiences at one French colony. Villages can also be classified according to the nationalities they attracted. Barbizon, [[Pont-Aven,]] Giverny, Katwijk, Newlyn, and Dachau drew artists from around the world and had a pronounced international flavour. Americans were always a major presence at [[Rijsoord]], Egmond, [[Gr\u00e8z-sur-Loing]], Laren, and St Ives; Gr\u00e8z-sur-Loing went through a Scandinavian phase in the 1880s; and Germans were the largest group after the indigenous Dutch at Katwijk. On the other hand, foreigners were rare at [[Sint-Martens-Latem]], [[Tervuren]], [[Nagybanya]], [[Kronberg]], [[Staithes]], Worpswede, and Willingshausen, while [[Skagen]] hosted mainly Danes and a few other Scandinavians.<ref name=\"Lubbren\"/>\n\nSome painters were renowned within artistic circles for settling down permanently in a single village, most notably [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]] at Barbizon, [[Robert Wylie]] at Pont-Aven, [[Otto Modersohn]] at Worpswede, [[Heinrich Otto]] at Willinghausen, and [[Claude Monet]] at Giverny. They were not necessarily leaders, although these artists were respected and held a certain [[moral authority]] in their respective colonies. There were also regular 'colony hoppers' who moved about the art colonies of Europe in a nomadic fashion. [[Max Liebermann]], for instance, painted at Barbizon, Dachau, Etzenhausen and at least six short-lived Dutch colonies; [[Frederick Waugh]] worked in Barbizon, Concarneau, Gr\u00e8z-sur-Loing, St Ives and Provincetown in the United States; [[Evert Pieters]] was active at Barbizon, Egmond, Katwijk, Laren, [[Blaricum]], Volendam, and [[Oosterbeek]]; [[Elizabeth Armstrong Forbes]] painted at Pont-Aven, [[Zandvoort]], Newlyn and St Ives.<ref name=\"Lubbren\"/>\n\nThe greater number of early European art colonies were to be casualties of the First World War. Europe was no longer the same place socially, politically, economically and culturally, and art colonies seemed a quaint anachronism in an abrasively modernist world. However, a small proportion did endure in one or another form, and owe their continuing existence to cultural tourism. The colonies of [[Ahrenshoop]], Barbizon, [[Fischerhude]], Katwijk, Laren, Sint-Martens-Latem, Skagen, Volendam, Willingshausen, and Worpswede not only still operate in a modest fashion, but run their own museums where, besides maintaining historic collections of work produced at the colony, they organise exhibition and lecture programs. If they have not fared as well, several former major colonies such as [[Concarneau]] and Newlyn are remembered via small yet significant collections of pictures held in regional museums. Other colonies succumbed during the late twentieth century to cultural entrepreneurs who have redeveloped villages in the effort to simulate, within certain kitsch parameters, the 'authentic' appearance of the colony during its artistic heyday. This is not always successful, with Giverny, Gr\u00e8z-sur-Loing, Kronberg, [[Le Pouldu]], Pont-Aven, [[Schwaan]], and [[Tervuren]] probably being among the most insensitively commercialised of the former art colonies.<ref name=\"Lubbren\"/>\n\n==American colonies==\nSome art colonies are organized and planned, while others arise because some artists like to congregate, finding fellowship and inspiration\u2014and constructive competition\u2014in the company of other artists.\n\nThe [[American Academy in Rome]], founded in 1894 originally as the American School of Architecture, which in the following year joined with the [[American School of Classical Studies]], is often cited as the early model for what would become the modern arts and humanities colony. Its well-funded, well-organized campus, and extensive program of fellowships, were soon replicated by early 20th-century artist colonies and their wealthy benefactors.\n\nThe [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]] art colony came into being when [[Charles Webster Hawthorne]] opened his Cape Cod School of Art there in the summer of 1899.<ref name=\"iamprovincetown.com\">[http://www.iamprovincetown.com/history/art-colony-history.html Provincetown History: The Art Colony, A Brief History]</ref> Other noted artists arrived and expanded the colony. In 1914 the Provincetown Art Association was founded. Business and professional people from the community as well as established artists provided the initial leadership and by 1916, a ''Boston Globe'' headline read \"Biggest Art Colony in the World at Provincetown.\" <ref name=\"iamprovincetown.com\"/> Provincetown claims to be the oldest continuously operating artist's colony in the United States.<ref>[http://www.provincetowntourismoffice.org/index.aspx?nid=75 Provincetown Tourism Office] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716065915/http://www.provincetowntourismoffice.org/index.aspx?nid=75 |date=July 16, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] Art Colony in Woodstock, New York began as two colonies: first [[Byrdcliffe Colony|Byrdcliffe]], founded in 1902 by [[Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead]], [[Hervey White]], and [[Bolton Brown]], and then the [[Maverick Concert Hall|Maverick]] Colony, founded by Hervey White after seceding from Byrdcliffe in 1904.<ref>''The Maverick: Hervey White's Colony of the Arts'', exh. cat. Woodstock: Woodstock Artists Association and Museum, 2006.</ref> The town of Woodstock remains an active center of art galleries, music, and theatrical performances.\n\nThe high desert town of [[Sedona, Arizona]], became a Southwest artists' colony from the mid-20th century. Modernists [[Max Ernst]] and [[Dorothea Tanning]] arrived from New York in the late 1940s, when the town was populated by less than 500 ranchers, orchard workers, merchants, and small Native American communities. Among the Wild West setting, Ernst built a small cottage by hand in Brewer Road, and he and Tanning hosted intellectuals and European artists such as [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] and [[Yves Tanguy]]. Sedona proved an inspiration for the artists, and for Ernst\u2014who compiled his book ''Beyond Painting'' and completed his sculptural masterpiece ''Capricorn'' while living there. The environment also inspired Egyptian sculptor Nassan Gobran to move there from Boston and become head of the art department at [[Verde Valley School]]. In Southern Arizona in the early and mid-twentieth century, the Historic [[Fort Lowell]] enclave outside of [[Tucson, Arizona]], became an artistic epicenter. The adobe ruins of the abandoned nineteenth century [[United States Cavalry]] fort had been adapted by [[Mexican-Americans]] into a small village called \"El Fuerte.\" During the 1920s, 30s and 40s, artists, writers and intellectuals, attracted by the rural elegance and stark landscape of the [[Sonoran Desert]], and romanticism of the [[adobe]] ruins began buying, redesigning and building homes in this small community. Notable artists included Dutch-born artist [[Charles Bolsius]], [[Black Mountain College]] instructor and photographer [[Hazel Larson Archer]], architectural designer and painter [[Veronica Hughart]], early modernist [[Jack Maul]], French writers and artists [[Ren\u00e9 Cheruy]] and [[Germaine Cheruy]], and noted anthropologists [[Edward H. Spicer]] and [[Rosamond Spicer]].\n\nThe [[MacDowell Colony]] in Peterborough, N. H., was founded in 1907 by composer [[Edward MacDowell]] and his wife, [[Marian MacDowell|Marian]]. MacDowell was inspired by his knowledge of the American Academy in Rome, and its mission to provide American artists with a home base at the centre of classical traditions and primary sources. MacDowell, who was a trustee of the American Academy, believed that a rural setting, free from distractions, would prove to be creatively valuable to artists. He also believed that discussions among working artists, architects and composers would enrich their work.\n\nIn upstate New York on Lake George [[Golden Heart Farm]] art colony the summer residence of Thomas and [[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]] of the [[Art Students League]] of New York opened in the summer of 1921. The colony and artists in residence activity were at the center of the American modernist movement as important artists from Manhattan traveled to Golden Heart Farm to escape the city and study with the couple<ref>The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm by Clint Bernard Weber, {{ISBN|0-9851601-0-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9851601-0-4}}</ref>\n\nIn Maryland, the Mid-Atlantic Plein Aire Company, most notable for the involvement of artist William David Simmons, is to this day active in its mission to bring local artists in touch with classical painting traditions.\n\nAnother famous colony, [[Yaddo]] in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., soon followed. [[Spencer Trask]] and his wife [[Katrina Trask]] conceived the idea of Yaddo in 1900, but the first residency program for artists did not formally initiate until 1926.\n\n[[Ox-Bow School of Art and Artists' Residency]] was founded in 1910 by Frederick Fursman and Walter Marshall Clute, two faculty members from the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC). Fursman and Clute's vision was to create a respite where faculty and students could immerse themselves completely in artmaking, surrounded by a supportive community of artists and an inspired landscape of natural dunes, woods and water. Ox-Bow is located in [[Saugatuck, Michigan]].\n\nIn [[Delray Beach, Florida]], a seasonal [[Delray Beach, Florida#Early years|Artists and Writers Colony]] existed during the winter months from the mid-1920s until the early 1950s. The Delray Beach enclave was noted for attracting many famous [[cartoonist]]s of the era.<ref>{{cite book |last=Credle-Rosenthal |first=McCall |date=2003 |title=Images of America: Delray Beach |url=http://www.arcadiapublishing.com |location=Charleston, South Carolina |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |pages=43\u201360 |isbn=978-0-7385-1570-0 |accessdate=2015-01-19 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Sandy Simon|year=1999|title=Remembering: A History of Florida's South Palm Beach County 1894-1998|publisher=The Cedars Group|isbn= 0-9669625-0-8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]]'s sister Norma created the [[Millay Colony for the Arts]] at the historic site of [[Steepletop]] in [[Austerlitz, NY]].\n\nThe [[Taos art colony]] in [[Taos, New Mexico]] is an example of more spontaneous development. Once artists began settling and working in Taos, others came, [[art gallery|art galleries and museums]] were opened and the area became an artistic center\u2014though not a formal, funded art colony providing artists with aid, as Yaddo and MacDowell do.<ref name=\"AAC\">{{cite book | last =Shipp | first =Steve | title =American Art Colonies, 1850-1930: A Historical Guide to America's Original Art Colonies and Their Artists | publisher =Greenwood Publishing | year =1996 | pages =[https://archive.org/details/americanartcolon00ship/page/159 159] | doi = | isbn =9780313296192 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/americanartcolon00ship/page/159 }}</ref>\nAn influential art colony in [[New York (state)|New York]] was the [[Roycroft]] community. Nearby was the cabin of the Saturday Sketch Club used by Buffalo art students who specialized in outdoor oil painting.\n\nThe small historic town of [[Jerome, Arizona]] was once a thriving copper mining town of 15,000. When the mining company [[Phelps Dodge]] closed the United Verde Mine and its related operations in 1953, the number of residents plummeted to 100. To prevent Jerome from disappearing entirely, the remaining residents turned to tourism and retail. To further encourage tourism, the residents sought [[National Historic Landmark]] status, which the federal government granted in 1967. Today, by sponsoring music festivals, historic-homes tours, celebrations, and races, the community succeeded in attracting visitors and new businesses, which in the twenty-first century include art galleries, working public studios, craft stores, wineries, coffee houses, and restaurants. Many residents are full-time artists, writers, and musicians.\n\nThe artists at [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]] coalesced in 1905 and incorporated their art gallery and meeting rooms a year later as the Carmel Arts and Crafts Club. They staged annual and special exhibitions, which attracted distinguished visiting artists from across the country, and provided professional instruction in painting, sculpture, and crafts. At the urging of his former student [[Jennie V. Cannon]], [[William Merritt Chase]] was persuaded to teach his last summer school here in 1914. Between 1919 and ca.1948 it was the largest art colony on the Pacific Coast of the United States. In 1927 the Carmel Art Association replaced the Arts and Crafts Club and thrives today as the nexus of for the art community on the Peninsula of [[Monterey, California]] and [[Big Sur]]. The Carmel Art Institute was established in 1938 and included among its illustrious instructors [[Armin Hansen]] and [[Paul Dougherty]].<ref name=\"edwards\">{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Jennie V.

They are organised by a range of bodies including city councils, monasteries, private collectors and artists. Generally the colonies only exist for a few weeks each year as many of the participants work on an academic calendar.

Artists are often invited or selected through a formal process, for a residency from a few weeks to over a year. Beginning with the early 20th century models, such as [[MacDowell Colony]] and [[Yaddo]], hundreds of modern-day artist colonies now offer the benefit of time, space, and collaborative time away from the usual workaday world. Worldwide, the two primary organizations serving artist colonies and residential centres are [[Res Artis]], based in [[Amsterdam]], and the [[Alliance of Artists Communities]], based in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. The [[Intra Asia Network]], based in [[Taiwan]], is a less formal body working to advance creative communities and exchanges throughout [[Asia]]. These consortia comprise most of the world's active artists' colonies.\n\nThe art movement itself has only started to be investigated by scholars, with the chief historical studies consisting of Michael Jacobs's introductory ''The Good and Simple Life''<ref>{{cite book|author=Jacobs, Michael|title=The Good and Simple Life: Artist Colonies in Europe and America|url=https://archive.org/details/goodsimplelifear00jaco|url-access=registration|publisher=Phaedon|year=1985|id=}}</ref> and Nina L\u00fcbbren's ''Artists\u2019 Colonies in Europe 1870-1910''.<ref name=\"Lubbren\">{{cite book|author=L\u00fcbbren, Nina|title=Rural Artists' Colonies in Europe 1870-1910|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2001|id=}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Formative period in Europe==\nArt colonies initially emerged as village movements in the 19th and early 20th century. It is estimated that between 1830 and 1914 some 3,000 professional artists participated in a mass movement away from urban centres into the countryside, residing for varying lengths of time in over eighty communities. There seem to have been three chief forms of these settlements, consisting of\n\n*villages with transient and annually fluctuating populations of artists\u2014mostly painters who visited for just a single summer season (such as [[Honfleur]], [[Giverny#The Giverny Colony|Giverny]], [[Katwijk]], [[Frauenchiemsee]], [[Volendam]], and [[Willingshausen]]);\n*villages with a semi-permanent mix of visiting and resident artists ([[Ahrenshoop]], [[Barbizon]], [[Concarneau]], [[Dachau art colony|Dachau]], [[St Ives, Cornwall|St. Ives]], [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]], and [[Skagen]]); and\n*villages in which a largely stable group of artists decided to settle permanently ([[Egmond (municipality)|Egmond]], [[Sint-Martens-Latem]], [[Newlyn]], and [[Worpswede#Artistic community|Worpswede]]).\n\nIn the latter villages, artists invariably bought or built their own houses and studios.\n\nWhile artist colonies appeared across Europe, as well as in America and Australia, L\u00fcbbren has found that the majority of colonies were clustered in the Netherlands, Central Germany, and France (encircling Paris). Overall, artists of thirty-five different nationalities were represented throughout these colonies, with Americans, Germans and British forming the largest participating groups. This gave socialising a cosmopolitan flavour: 'Russia, Sweden, England, Austria, Germany, France, Australia and the United States were represented at our table, all as one large family, and striving towards the same goal,' the painter Annie Goater penned in 1885 in an essay on her recent experiences at one French colony. Villages can also be classified according to the nationalities they attracted. Barbizon, [[Pont-Aven,]] Giverny, Katwijk, Newlyn, and Dachau drew artists from around the world and had a pronounced international flavour. Americans were always a major presence at [[Rijsoord]], Egmond, [[Gr\u00e8z-sur-Loing]], Laren, and St Ives; Gr\u00e8z-sur-Loing went through a Scandinavian phase in the 1880s; and Germans were the largest group after the indigenous Dutch at Katwijk. On the other hand, foreigners were rare at [[Sint-Martens-Latem]], [[Tervuren]], [[Nagybanya]], [[Kronberg]], [[Staithes]], Worpswede, and Willingshausen, while [[Skagen]] hosted mainly Danes and a few other Scandinavians.<ref name=\"Lubbren\"/>\n\nSome painters were renowned within artistic circles for settling down permanently in a single village, most notably [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]] at Barbizon, [[Robert Wylie]] at Pont-Aven, [[Otto Modersohn]] at Worpswede, [[Heinrich Otto]] at Willinghausen, and [[Claude Monet]] at Giverny. They were not necessarily leaders, although these artists were respected and held a certain [[moral authority]] in their respective colonies. There were also regular 'colony hoppers' who moved about the art colonies of Europe in a nomadic fashion. [[Max Liebermann]], for instance, painted at Barbizon, Dachau, Etzenhausen and at least six short-lived Dutch colonies; [[Frederick Waugh]] worked in Barbizon, Concarneau, Gr\u00e8z-sur-Loing, St Ives and Provincetown in the United States; [[Evert Pieters]] was active at Barbizon, Egmond, Katwijk, Laren, [[Blaricum]], Volendam, and [[Oosterbeek]]; [[Elizabeth Armstrong Forbes]] painted at Pont-Aven, [[Zandvoort]], Newlyn and St Ives.<ref name=\"Lubbren\"/>\n\nThe greater number of early European art colonies were to be casualties of the First World War. Europe was no longer the same place socially, politically, economically and culturally, and art colonies seemed a quaint anachronism in an abrasively modernist world. However, a small proportion did endure in one or another form, and owe their continuing existence to cultural tourism. The colonies of [[Ahrenshoop]], Barbizon, [[Fischerhude]], Katwijk, Laren, Sint-Martens-Latem, Skagen, Volendam, Willingshausen, and Worpswede not only still operate in a modest fashion, but run their own museums where, besides maintaining historic collections of work produced at the colony, they organise exhibition and lecture programs. If they have not fared as well, several former major colonies such as [[Concarneau]] and Newlyn are remembered via small yet significant collections of pictures held in regional museums. Other colonies succumbed during the late twentieth century to cultural entrepreneurs who have redeveloped villages in the effort to simulate, within certain kitsch parameters, the 'authentic' appearance of the colony during its artistic heyday. This is not always successful, with Giverny, Gr\u00e8z-sur-Loing, Kronberg, [[Le Pouldu]], Pont-Aven, [[Schwaan]], and [[Tervuren]] probably being among the most insensitively commercialised of the former art colonies.<ref name=\"Lubbren\"/>\n\n==American colonies==\nSome art colonies are organized and planned, while others arise because some artists like to congregate, finding fellowship and inspiration\u2014and constructive competition\u2014in the company of other artists.\n\nThe [[American Academy in Rome]], founded in 1894 originally as the American School of Architecture, which in the following year joined with the [[American School of Classical Studies]], is often cited as the early model for what would become the modern arts and humanities colony. Its well-funded, well-organized campus, and extensive program of fellowships, were soon replicated by early 20th-century artist colonies and their wealthy benefactors.\n\nThe [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]] art colony came into being when [[Charles Webster Hawthorne]] opened his Cape Cod School of Art there in the summer of 1899.<ref name=\"iamprovincetown.com\">[http://www.iamprovincetown.com/history/art-colony-history.html Provincetown History: The Art Colony, A Brief History]</ref> Other noted artists arrived and expanded the colony. In 1914 the Provincetown Art Association was founded. Business and professional people from the community as well as established artists provided the initial leadership and by 1916, a ''Boston Globe'' headline read \"Biggest Art Colony in the World at Provincetown.\" <ref name=\"iamprovincetown.com\"/> Provincetown claims to be the oldest continuously operating artist's colony in the United States.<ref>[http://www.provincetowntourismoffice.org/index.aspx?nid=75 Provincetown Tourism Office] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716065915/http://www.provincetowntourismoffice.org/index.aspx?nid=75 |date=July 16, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] Art Colony in Woodstock, New York began as two colonies: first [[Byrdcliffe Colony|Byrdcliffe]], founded in 1902 by [[Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead]], [[Hervey White]], and [[Bolton Brown]], and then the [[Maverick Concert Hall|Maverick]] Colony, founded by Hervey White after seceding from Byrdcliffe in 1904.<ref>''The Maverick: Hervey White's Colony of the Arts'', exh. cat. Woodstock: Woodstock Artists Association and Museum, 2006.</ref> The town of Woodstock remains an active center of art galleries, music, and theatrical performances.\n\nThe high desert town of [[Sedona, Arizona]], became a Southwest artists' colony from the mid-20th century. Modernists [[Max Ernst]] and [[Dorothea Tanning]] arrived from New York in the late 1940s, when the town was populated by less than 500 ranchers, orchard workers, merchants, and small Native American communities. Among the Wild West setting, Ernst built a small cottage by hand in Brewer Road, and he and Tanning hosted intellectuals and European artists such as [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] and [[Yves Tanguy]]. Sedona proved an inspiration for the artists, and for Ernst\u2014who compiled his book ''Beyond Painting'' and completed his sculptural masterpiece ''Capricorn'' while living there. The environment also inspired Egyptian sculptor Nassan Gobran to move there from Boston and become head of the art department at [[Verde Valley School]]. In Southern Arizona in the early and mid-twentieth century, the Historic [[Fort Lowell]] enclave outside of [[Tucson, Arizona]], became an artistic epicenter. The adobe ruins of the abandoned nineteenth century [[United States Cavalry]] fort had been adapted by [[Mexican-Americans]] into a small village called \"El Fuerte.\" During the 1920s, 30s and 40s, artists, writers and intellectuals, attracted by the rural elegance and stark landscape of the [[Sonoran Desert]], and romanticism of the [[adobe]] ruins began buying, redesigning and building homes in this small community. Notable artists included Dutch-born artist [[Charles Bolsius]], [[Black Mountain College]] instructor and photographer [[Hazel Larson Archer]], architectural designer and painter [[Veronica Hughart]], early modernist [[Jack Maul]], French writers and artists [[Ren\u00e9 Cheruy]] and [[Germaine Cheruy]], and noted anthropologists [[Edward H. Spicer]] and [[Rosamond Spicer]].\n\nThe [[MacDowell Colony]] in Peterborough, N. H., was founded in 1907 by composer [[Edward MacDowell]] and his wife, [[Marian MacDowell|Marian]]. MacDowell was inspired by his knowledge of the American Academy in Rome, and its mission to provide American artists with a home base at the centre of classical traditions and primary sources. MacDowell, who was a trustee of the American Academy, believed that a rural setting, free from distractions, would prove to be creatively valuable to artists. He also believed that discussions among working artists, architects and composers would enrich their work.\n\nIn upstate New York on Lake George [[Golden Heart Farm]] art colony the summer residence of Thomas and [[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]] of the [[Art Students League]] of New York opened in the summer of 1921. The colony and artists in residence activity were at the center of the American modernist movement as important artists from Manhattan traveled to Golden Heart Farm to escape the city and study with the couple<ref>The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm by Clint Bernard Weber, {{ISBN|0-9851601-0-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9851601-0-4}}</ref>\n\nIn Maryland, the Mid-Atlantic Plein Aire Company, most notable for the involvement of artist William David Simmons, is to this day active in its mission to bring local artists in touch with classical painting traditions.\n\nAnother famous colony, [[Yaddo]] in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., soon followed. [[Spencer Trask]] and his wife [[Katrina Trask]] conceived the idea of Yaddo in 1900, but the first residency program for artists did not formally initiate until 1926.\n\n[[Ox-Bow School of Art and Artists' Residency]] was founded in 1910 by Frederick Fursman and Walter Marshall Clute, two faculty members from the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC). Fursman and Clute's vision was to create a respite where faculty and students could immerse themselves completely in artmaking, surrounded by a supportive community of artists and an inspired landscape of natural dunes, woods and water. Ox-Bow is located in [[Saugatuck, Michigan]].\n\nIn [[Delray Beach, Florida]], a seasonal [[Delray Beach, Florida#Early years|Artists and Writers Colony]] existed during the winter months from the mid-1920s until the early 1950s. The Delray Beach enclave was noted for attracting many famous [[cartoonist]]s of the era.<ref>{{cite book |last=Credle-Rosenthal |first=McCall |date=2003 |title=Images of America: Delray Beach |url=http://www.arcadiapublishing.com |location=Charleston, South Carolina |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |pages=43\u201360 |isbn=978-0-7385-1570-0 |accessdate=2015-01-19 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Sandy Simon|year=1999|title=Remembering: A History of Florida's South Palm Beach County 1894-1998|publisher=The Cedars Group|isbn= 0-9669625-0-8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]]'s sister Norma created the [[Millay Colony for the Arts]] at the historic site of [[Steepletop]] in [[Austerlitz, NY]].\n\nThe [[Taos art colony]] in [[Taos, New Mexico]] is an example of more spontaneous development. Once artists began settling and working in Taos, others came, [[art gallery|art galleries and museums]] were opened and the area became an artistic center\u2014though not a formal, funded art colony providing artists with aid, as Yaddo and MacDowell do.<ref name=\"AAC\">{{cite book | last =Shipp | first =Steve | title =American Art Colonies, 1850-1930: A Historical Guide to America's Original Art Colonies and Their Artists | publisher =Greenwood Publishing | year =1996 | pages =[https://archive.org/details/americanartcolon00ship/page/159 159] | doi = | isbn =9780313296192 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/americanartcolon00ship/page/159 }}</ref>\nAn influential art colony in [[New York (state)|New York]] was the [[Roycroft]] community. Nearby was the cabin of the Saturday Sketch Club used by Buffalo art students who specialized in outdoor oil painting.\n\nThe small historic town of [[Jerome, Arizona]] was once a thriving copper mining town of 15,000. When the mining company [[Phelps Dodge]] closed the United Verde Mine and its related operations in 1953, the number of residents plummeted to 100. To prevent Jerome from disappearing entirely, the remaining residents turned to tourism and retail. To further encourage tourism, the residents sought [[National Historic Landmark]] status, which the federal government granted in 1967. Today, by sponsoring music festivals, historic-homes tours, celebrations, and races, the community succeeded in attracting visitors and new businesses, which in the twenty-first century include art galleries, working public studios, craft stores, wineries, coffee houses, and restaurants. Many residents are full-time artists, writers, and musicians.\n\nThe artists at [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]] coalesced in 1905 and incorporated their art gallery and meeting rooms a year later as the Carmel Arts and Crafts Club. They staged annual and special exhibitions, which attracted distinguished visiting artists from across the country, and provided professional instruction in painting, sculpture, and crafts. At the urging of his former student [[Jennie V. Cannon]], [[William Merritt Chase]] was persuaded to teach his last summer school here in 1914. Between 1919 and ca.1948 it was the largest art colony on the Pacific Coast of the United States. In 1927 the Carmel Art Association replaced the Arts and Crafts Club and thrives today as the nexus of for the art community on the Peninsula of [[Monterey, California]] and [[Big Sur]]. The Carmel Art Institute was established in 1938 and included among its illustrious instructors [[Armin Hansen]] and [[Paul Dougherty]].<ref name=\"edwards\">{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Jennie V.

They are organised by a range of bodies including city councils, monasteries, private collectors and artists. Generally the colonies only exist for a few weeks each year as many of the participants work on an academic calendar. Some of the colonies (Stumista) have been in existence for over 40 years and their reputation allows them to attract a range of international artists.

He was one of the leading players on the [[European Tour]] from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, and featured in the top 10 of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] for 83 weeks from 1987 to 1992.<ref>[http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/2007%20Stats/86TO0810.pdf 69 Players Who Have Reached The Top-10 In World Ranking]</ref>\n\nMcNulty was born in [[Bindura]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now known as [[Zimbabwe]]). He was raised on a farm in the Centenary area of Zimbabwe. His step-father was an amateur pilot who had an airstrip on the farm. When his step-father was diagnosed with epilepsy, he was forced to give up flying. He converted the airstrip into a three-hole golf course, where Mark first learned to play golf.\n\nMcNulty became an [[Irish nationality law|Irish citizen]] in 2003 at the age of 50. He was eligible to do so because his maternal grandmother was born in [[Ballymena]] in Northern Ireland. He stated that his reason for doing so was his concern that as a non-resident Zimbabwean it could take him up to two years to get his passport renewed if he lost it. Commentators elaborated that the farm that his family had been managing for 40-something years had been confiscated by the [[Robert Mugabe|Mugabe]] regime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indigo.ie/~kands/kands/html/mcnult.html |title=Mark McNulty takes Irish {{sic|citzenship|nolink=y}} |first=Brian |last=Keogh |date=27 November 2003 |accessdate=21 June 2012 }}</ref> He lives in [[Sunningdale]], England.\n\n==Career==\nAfter a successful amateur career, McNulty began his professional career on the Southern African Tour (now the [[Sunshine Tour]]) and also played on the European Tour starting in 1978. His first professional win was the 1979 Holiday Inns Royal Swazi Sun Open in South Africa. By 1986 he was a dominant player on the Southern African Tour, picking up seven official wins in that year and also winning South Africa's most lucrative event, the [[Nedbank Golf Challenge|Million Dollar Challenge]]. In the same year he finished in the top ten on the European Tour's Order of Merit for the first time, placing sixth. He had six top ten European Order of Merit finishes in total, including second places in 1987 and 1990. The last of these was in 1996, when he came fifth. His win tally on the European Tour was sixteen, including the 1996 [[Volvo Masters]], which was the European equivalent of the [[PGA Tour]]'s [[Tour Championship]]. He won the [[Sunshine Tour]] Order of Merit nine times: 1980/81, 1981/82, 1984/85, 1985/86, 1986/87, 1992/93, 1996/97, 1997/98, 2000/01.\n\nWhen McNulty turned fifty and became eligible to play senior golf he chose to take part in the U.S.-based [[Champions Tour]]. His first full season in 2004 was highly successful with three wins (including the [[Charles Schwab Cup Championship]]) and a seventh-place finish on the money list. In 2007 he won the [[The Tradition|JELD-WEN Tradition]], one of the five major championships on the over-50 tour. It was McNulty's sixth career win on the Champions Tour. His seventh win came in 2009 at the [[Principal Charity Classic]] with a playoff win over [[Nick Price]] and [[Fred Funk]].\n\nMcNulty lists his interests as piano, [[fine arts]], scuba activities, underwater photography, and shark diving.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pgatour.com/players/player.01796.mark-mcnulty.html |title=Mark McNulty \u2013 Profile |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=14 March

golf course, while growing the game of golf.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://markmcnulty.org/ |title=Mark McNulty Junior Golf Foundation}}</ref>\n\n==Amateur wins (2)==\n*1974 Rhodesia Amateur

Irish/Zimbabwean [[professional golfer]] currently playing on the [[PGA Tour Champions]]. He was one of the leading players on the [[European Tour]] from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, and featured in the top 10 of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] for 83 weeks from 1987 to 1992.<ref>[http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/2007%20Stats/86TO0810.pdf 69 Players Who Have Reached The Top-10 In World Ranking]</ref>\n\nMcNulty was born in [[Bindura]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now known as [[Zimbabwe]]). He was raised on a farm in the Centenary area of Zimbabwe. His step-father was an amateur pilot who had an airstrip on the farm. When his step-father was diagnosed with epilepsy, he was forced to give up flying. He converted the airstrip into a three-hole golf course, where Mark first learned to play golf.\n\nMcNulty became an [[Irish nationality law|Irish citizen]] in 2003 at the age of 50. He was eligible to do so because his maternal grandmother was born in [[Ballymena]] in Northern Ireland. He stated that his reason for doing so was his concern that as a non-resident Zimbabwean it could take him up to two years to get his passport renewed if he lost it. Commentators elaborated that the farm that his family had been managing for 40-something years had been confiscated by the [[Robert Mugabe|Mugabe]] regime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indigo.ie/~kands/kands/html/mcnult.html |title=Mark McNulty takes Irish {{sic|citzenship|nolink=y}} |first=Brian |last=Keogh |date=27 November 2003 |accessdate=21 June 2012 }}</ref> He lives in [[Sunningdale]], England.\n\n==Career==\nAfter a successful amateur career, McNulty began his professional career on the Southern African Tour (now the [[Sunshine Tour]]) and also played on the European Tour starting in 1978. His first professional win was the 1979 Holiday Inns Royal Swazi Sun Open in South Africa. By 1986 he was a dominant player on the Southern African Tour, picking up seven official wins in that year and also winning South Africa's most lucrative event, the [[Nedbank Golf Challenge|Million Dollar Challenge]]. In the same year he finished in the top ten on the European Tour's Order of Merit for the first time, placing sixth. He had six top ten European Order of Merit finishes in total, including second places in 1987 and 1990. The last of these was in 1996, when he came fifth. His win tally on the European Tour was sixteen, including the 1996 [[Volvo Masters]], which was the European equivalent of the [[PGA Tour]]'s [[Tour Championship]]. He won the [[Sunshine Tour]] Order of Merit nine times: 1980/81, 1981/82, 1984/85, 1985/86, 1986/87, 1992/93, 1996/97, 1997/98, 2000/01.\n\nWhen McNulty turned fifty and became eligible to play senior golf he chose to take part in the U.S.-based [[Champions Tour]]. His first full season in 2004 was highly successful with three wins (including the [[Charles Schwab Cup Championship]]) and a seventh-place finish on the money list. In 2007 he won the [[The Tradition|JELD-WEN Tradition]], one of the five major championships on the over-50 tour. It was McNulty's sixth career win on the Champions Tour. His seventh win came in 2009 at the [[Principal Charity Classic]] with a playoff win over [[Nick Price]] and [[Fred Funk]].\n\nMcNulty lists his interests as piano, [[fine arts]], scuba activities, underwater photography, and shark diving.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pgatour.com/players/player.01796.mark-mcnulty.html |title=Mark McNulty \u2013 Profile |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=14 March

golf course, while growing the game of golf.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://markmcnulty.org/ |title=Mark McNulty Junior Golf Foundation}}</ref>\n\n==Amateur wins (2)==\n*1974 Rhodesia Amateur

The story revolves around a young nurse named Alma (Andersson) and her patient, well-known stage actress Elisabet Vogler (Ullmann), who has suddenly stopped speaking. They move to a cottage, where Alma cares for Elisabet, confides in her and begins having trouble distinguishing herself from her patient.\n\nCharacterized by elements of [[psychological horror]], ''Persona'' has been the subject of much critical analysis, interpretation and debate. The film's exploration of duality, insanity and [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]] has been interpreted as reflecting the [[Jungian]] theory of ''[[persona (psychology)|persona]]'' and dealing with issues related to filmmaking, vampire mythology, lesbianism, motherhood, abortion and other subjects. The experimental style of its prologue and storytelling has also been noted. The enigmatic film has been called the [[Mount Everest]] of cinematic analysis; according to film historian [[Peter Cowie]], \"Everything one says about ''Persona'' may be contradicted; the opposite will also be true\".{{refn|group=n|name=\"Interpretation\"|Professor [[Thomas Elsaesser]] likened the piece to Mount Everest and ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' in his essay for [[The Criterion Collection]].<ref name=\"Elsaesser\">{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3116-the-persistence-of-persona |title=The Persistence of Persona |last=Elsaesser |first=Thomas |date=27 March 2014 |accessdate=20 November 2016 |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121171658/https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3116-the-persistence-of-persona |archivedate=21 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Cowie is quoted by academic Frank Gado and editor Lloyd Michaels, who found some exaggeration in Cowie's claim but agreed with the sentiment of the challenges of interpretation.{{sfn|Michaels|2000|p=5}}{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=340}}}}\n\nBergman wrote ''Persona'' with Ullmann and Andersson in mind for the lead roles and the idea of exploring their identities, and shot the film in [[Stockholm]] and [[F\u00e5r\u00f6]] in 1965. In production, the filmmakers experimented with effects, using smoke and a mirror to frame one scene and combining the lead characters' faces in post-production for one shot. Andersson defended a sexually explicit monologue in the screenplay, and rewrote portions of it.\n \nWhen first released, ''Persona'' was edited because of its controversial subject matter. It received positive reviews, with Swedish media coining the word ''Person(a)kult'' to describe its enthusiastic admirers. It won [[Guldbagge Award for Best Film|Best Film]] at the [[4th Guldbagge Awards]], and was Sweden's entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. The censored content was reinstated in English-language restorations in 2001. Many critics consider ''Persona'' one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]], and it was ranked the fifth-best in ''[[Sight & Sound]]''{{'}}s 1972 poll and 17th in 2012. It also influenced many later directors, including [[Robert Altman]] and [[David Lynch]].\n\n==Plot==\nA projector begins screening a series of images, including a [[crucifixion]], a spider and the killing of a lamb, and a boy wakes up in a hospital or [[morgue]]. He sees a large screen with a blurry image of two women. One of the women may be Alma, a young nurse assigned by a doctor to care for Elisabet Vogler. Elisabet is a stage actress who has suddenly [[muteness|stopped speaking]] and moving, which the doctors have determined is the result of willpower rather than physical or mental illness. In the hospital, Elisabet is distressed by television images of a man's self-immolation during the [[Vietnam War]]. Alma reads her a letter from her husband that contains a photo of their son, and the actress tears the photograph up. The doctor speculates that Elisabet may recover better in a cottage by the sea, and sends her there with Alma.\n\nAt the cottage, Alma tells Elisabet that no one has ever really listened to her before. She talks about her fianc\u00e9, Karl-Henrik, and her first affair. Alma tells a story of how, while she was already in a relationship with Karl-Henrik, she [[Sun tanning|sunbathed]] in the nude with Katarina, a woman she had just met. Two young boys appeared, and Katarina initiated an [[orgy]]. Alma became pregnant, had an [[abortion in Sweden|abortion]] and continues to feel guilty.\n\n[[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 06b.jpg|thumb|alt=Iconic photograph of Jewish women and children being herded out of a building|Stroop Report photograph, found by Elisabet, of Polish Jews captured after the Warsaw Ghetto uprising]]\nAlma drives to town to mail their letters, and notices that Elisabet's is not sealed. She reads it. The letter says that Elisabet is \"studying\" Alma and mentions the nurse's orgy and abortion. Furious, Alma accuses Elisabet of using her for some purpose. In the resulting fight, she threatens to scald Elisabet with boiling water and stops when Elisabet begs her not to. This is the first time Alma is certain the actress has spoken since they met, though she thought Elisabet previously whispered to her when Alma was half-asleep. Alma tells her that she knows she is a terrible person; when Elisabet runs off, Alma chases her and begs for forgiveness. Later, Elisabet looks at the [[Warsaw Ghetto boy|famous photograph]] of Jews arrested in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] from the [[Stroop Report]].\n\nOne night, Alma hears a man outside calling for Elisabet; it is Elisabet's husband. He calls Alma \"Elisabet\" and, though the nurse tells him he is mistaken, they have sex. Alma meets with Elisabet to talk about why Elisabet tore up the photo of her son. Alma tells much of Elisabet's story: that she wanted the only thing she did not have, motherhood, and became pregnant. Regretting her decision, Elisabet attempted a failed [[self-induced abortion]] and gave birth to a boy whom she despises, but her son craves her love. Alma ends the story in distress, asserting her identity and denying that she is Elisabet. She later coaxes Elisabet to say the word \"nothing\", and leaves the cottage as a crew films her.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Interi\u00f6r fr\u00e5n Sophiahemmet - Nordiska Museet - NMA.0053286.jpg|200px|thumb|alt=Old photograph of a hallway with people sitting|''Persona'' was written at the [[Sophiahemmet]] hospital.]]\nAccording to Bergman, the story had its roots in a chance encounter with past collaborator [[Bibi Andersson]]{{refn|group=n|name=\"Andersson\"|Bibi Andersson first starred in Bergman's films in 1957 (''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' and ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'') and ''[[The Devil's Eye]]'' in 1960, with her saying that he often cast her in na\u00efve roles. She later appeared in ''[[The Passion of Anna]]'' in 1969 and ''[[Scenes from a Marriage]]'' in 1973.<ref name=\"Callahan\"/> }} in a [[Stockholm]] street. Andersson, who was with Liv Ullmann, introduced Ullmann to him.{{sfn|Bergman|2014|p=26}} Ullmann placed the meeting in 1964, and said that Bergman recognized her and asked her on the spot if she would like to work with him.<ref name=\"UllmannBlu\"/> He said that an image of the two women formed in his mind; in the hospital, he found an \"uncanny resemblance\" between the actresses in photographs of them sunbathing. This inspired the beginning of his story, a vision of two women \"wearing big hats and laying their hands alongside each other\".{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=321}} Andersson said, \"Liv and I had worked together before and we were very close\". Bergman had been in a romantic relationship with Andersson and was attracted to Ullmann; of ''Persona''{{'}}s conception, Andersson said, \"He saw our friendship, and he wanted to get ... inside of it.

Alma remains on the island and plans to write Elisabet a letter until she sees the Holocaust photo and abandons her plan.{{refn|group=n|name=\"Screenplay\"|Authors described this original ending.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=339}}{{sfn|Sitney|1990|p=131}} In the screenplay, instead of writing her letter, Alma then falls back on her maxim: \"I'm terribly fond of people. Mostly when they're sick and I can help them. I'll marry and have children. I believe that is what life has in store for me in this world\".{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=339}} The last scene featuring Elisabet called for a close-up portraying \"A howling wide-open face, distorted by terror, with wild wide-open eyes and furrows of sweat running through her make-up ... [Her] face starts to move, assumes strange contours. The words become meaningless, running and jumping, finally vanishing altogether\".{{sfn|Young|2015|pp=126-127}} }} Later in the production, this was replaced by the blood-drinking scene, Elisabet being taught to say the word \"nothing\" and Alma leaving the island.{{sfn|Sitney|1990|p=131}}\n\nBergman appealed to filmmaker [[Kenne Fant]] for funding for the project. Supportive, Fant asked about the film's concept and Bergman shared his vision of women comparing hands. Fant assumed that the film would be inexpensive, and agreed to fund it.{{sfn|Bergman|2014|p=27}} In his book ''Images'', Bergman wrote, \"Today I feel that in ''Persona'' \u2014 and later in ''[[Cries and Whispers]]'' \u2014 I had gone as far as I could go. And that in these two instances when working in total freedom, I touched wordless secrets that only the cinema can discover.\" He also said, \"At some time or other, I said that ''Persona'' saved my life\u2014that is no exaggeration.

They didn't recognize their own faces.

Critic [[Peter Cowie]] wrote, \"Everything one says about ''Persona'' may be contradicted; the opposite will also be true\".

According to author Paul Coates, ''Persona'' was the \"aftermath\" of that exploration.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=166}} Gervais added that ''Persona'' and other Bergman films between 1965 and 1970 were not \"God-centred\".{{sfn|Gervais|1999|p=103}} Gervais also quoted philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] as a guide to understanding ''Persona'': \"Belief in the absolute immorality of Nature, in lack of purpose, and in meaninglessness, is the ''affect'' psychologically necessary once belief in God and an essentially moral order is no longer supportable\".{{sfn|Gervais|1999|pp=103-104}}\n\n===Identity and duality===\n[[File:Richard Mansfield Jekyll.png|150px|thumb|left|alt=Double-exposure photograph of late-19th-century actor Richard Mansfield as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Professor [[Irving Singer]] compared Bergman's merged characters to [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]].]]\nAnalysis has focused on the characters' resemblance, demonstrated in shots of overlapping faces in which one face is visible and part of another is seen behind it, suggesting the possibility that the characters are one,<ref name=\"Elsaesser\"/> and their duality.{{sfn|Vermilye|2002|p=124}}{{sfn|Ketcham|1986|p=242}} Critic [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] commented, \"This duality can be embodied in two persons, as it is here, but it has a distinct relevance to the contradictory aspects of a single person\".{{sfn|Simon|1974|p=224}} If they are one person, the questions exist of whether Alma is fantasizing about the actress she admires, Elisabet is examining her psyche, or the boy is trying to understand his mother.{{sfn|Steene|2000|p=40}} [[Susan Sontag]] suggested that ''Persona'' is a series of variations on the theme of \"[[Doubling (psychodrama)|doubling]]\".{{sfn|Sontag|2002|p=1}} According to Sontag, the film's subject is \"violence of the spirit\".{{sfn|Sontag|2002|p=1}} Professor [[Irving Singer]], examining the shot in which Alma and Elisabet's faces are combined, compared its repulsive effect to that of seeing [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s character [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Mr. Hyde]] instead of his benign alter ego, Dr. Jekyll. Singer wrote that Bergman expanded on Stevenson's exploration of duality, the \"[[good and evil]], light and dark aspects of our nature\", depicting it as \"oneness\" in the shot.{{sfn|Singer|2009|p=164}}\n\nGado saw ''Persona'' as a \"double-threaded process of discovery involving motherhood\".{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=342}} Elisabet's withdrawal into silence could be her rejection of motherhood, the only role the actress could not slough off. The nurse realizes that she has done what Elisabet tried and failed to do: erase a child from her life by abortion.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=343}} Psychiatrist Barbara Young viewed the boy in the morgue in the film's prologue as a stand-in for Bergman, in a morgue he remembered, reaching out to his mother.

Bergman agreed, saying that Jung's theory \"fits well in this case\".{{sfn|Denzin|1992|p=28}} Coates also connected masks to themes of identity and duality: \"The mask is [[Janus]]-faced\".{{sfn|Coates|2012|pp=158-172}}\n\nAlma's secret is revealed in her orgy monologue, and critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] related it to a combination of shame and nostalgia perhaps indicating the character's [[sexual liberation]]. According to Wood, the incident touched on unfaithfulness and [[Child sexuality|juvenile sexuality]];{{sfn|Wood|2012|p=265}} in Swedish, the young boys are called \"''[[wiktionary:pojkar|pojkar]]''\" and are in need of coaching.{{sfn|Wood|2012|pp=265-266}} [[Arnold Weinstein (scholar)|Arnold Weinstein]] wrote that Alma's story is the hardest-hitting example of the \"cracks\" in the character's mask, belying her persona of a nurse and leading to a \"collapse of self\".{{sfn|Weinstein|2008|p=302}} Her monologue is so intense that it verges on pornography, although there is no depiction of the sexual escapade.{{sfn|Weinstein|2008|p=302}}\n\nCinema historian [[P. Adams Sitney]] summarized the story as following the course of [[psychoanalysis]]: a referral, followed by the first interview, disclosures and the discovery of the patient's root problem.{{sfn|Sitney|1990|p=131}} According to Sitney, the story seems to begin from Alma's point of view; after Elisabet compares their hands, her point of view is revealed as the source of the story.{{sfn|Sitney|1990|p=129}}\n\nAnother possible reference to psychology is that when Elisabet falls mute, the play she is in is ''Electra'' by [[Electra (Sophocles play)|Sophocles]] or [[Electra (Euripides play)|Euripides]].{{sfn|Sitney|1990|p=143}} According to Wood, Bergman did not focus on [[Greek tragedy]] in his work but the character of [[Electra]] inspired the idea of the [[Electra complex]].{{sfn|Wood|1998|p=251}} Sitney felt that Bergman's choice of play related to \"sexual identities\", a key concept in psychoanalysis.{{sfn|Sitney|1990|p=143}}\n\n===Gender and sexuality===\nThe story fits Bergman's motif of \"warring women\", seen earlier in ''The Silence'' and later in ''Cries and Whispers'' and ''[[Autumn Sonata]]''.{{sfn|Orr|2014|p=67}} According to Professor Marilyn Johns Blackwell, Elisabet's resistance to speaking can be interpreted as resistance to her [[gender roles|gender role]]. By depicting this tension as experienced primarily by women, Bergman may be said to \"problematize the position of woman as other\"; the role society assigns women is \"essentially foreign to their subjecthood\".{{sfn|Blackwell|1997|p=135}} Blackwell wrote that the attraction between Elisabet and Alma and the absence of male sexuality cohere with their identification with each other, creating a doubling that reveals the \"multiple, shifting, self-contradictory identity\" (a notion of identity that undermines male ideology). The theme of merging and doubling surfaces early in the film, when Alma says that she saw one of Elisabet's films and was struck by the thought that they were alike.{{sfn|Blackwell|1997|p=151}} Blackwell also writes that one of the film's original titles, ''A Piece of Cinematography'', may allude to the nature of representation.{{sfn|Blackwell|1997|p=134}}\n\nAnalysts have noted possible lesbian under-{{sfn|Michaels|2000|p=5}} and overtones.{{sfn|Gervais|1999|p=96}} Alison Darren profiled ''Persona'' in her ''Lesbian Film Guide'', calling Alma and Elisabet's relationship \"halfway between love and hate\"; they may come close to having sex in one scene, \"though this might easily be an illusion\".{{sfn|Darren|2000|p=164}} Scholar [[Gwendolyn Audrey Foster]] interpreted the film in [[Feminist theory|feminist]] terms as a depiction of [[lesbian films|lesbianism]], viewing the scene where Elisabet enters Alma's room as seduction.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=138}} Professor Alexis Luko also felt that the characters' touching and resemblance in the scene, in addition to symbolizing their personalities merging, indicated intimacy and eroticism.{{sfn|Luko|2015|p=140}}\n\nFoster believed that Elisabet's gaze presents Alma with questions about her engagement to Karl-Henrik.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=135}} According to Foster, sexual encounters between men and women are associated with abortion; lesbian romance has an increasingly shared identity.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=137}} But if ''Persona'' dramatizes a lesbian relationship, it is not clearly favorable, as it is later characterized by narcissism and violence.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=137}} If lesbianism is considered a stronger version of female friendship, or motherly love, Alma and Elisabet's relationship replaces the depiction of the [[Oedipus complex]] in the prologue when the boy reaches for his mother in vain.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=134}} According to Jeremi Szaniawski, Bergman's use of [[homoeroticism]] (gay and lesbian) in ''Persona'', ''[[Hour of the Wolf]]'', ''Cries and Whispers'' and ''[[Face to Face (1976 film)|Face to Face]]'' was a rebellion against his strict upbringing by [[Church of Sweden]] minister [[Erik Bergman (Lutheran minister)|Erik Bergman]].{{sfn|Szaniawski|2013|p=151}}\n[[File:Tragic mask of terra cotta, with the mouth wide open, representing the \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf, or persona, of the ancients - Dodwell Edward - 1819.jpg|200px|thumb|alt=Front and side views of a tragic mask|[[Edward Dodwell]]'s depiction of an ancient Greek mask]]\n\n===Art and theatre===\n''[[Persona]]'' is the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for \"mask\" and referred to a mouthpiece actors wore to increase the audibility of their lines.

Singer wrote that Elisabet wears \"thick and artificial eyelashes\" even when she is not acting.{{sfn|Singer|2009|pp=171-172}} Scholar [[Egil T\u00f6rnqvist]] noted that when Elisabet is onstage as Electra, she looks away from the theatre audience and breaks the [[fourth wall]] by looking at the camera. According to T\u00f6rnqvist, Elisabet makes a fist, symbolizing her revolt against the notion of meaningful performance.{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|2003|p=207}} Singer concluded that although Elisabet develops a very personal relationship with Alma, she cannot shed her ''persona'' as an actress and will remain lonely with \"the hopeless dream of being\".{{sfn|Singer|2009|p=172}}\n\n[[File:Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c self-immolation.jpg|200px|left|thumb|alt=See caption|Journalist [[Malcolm Browne]]'s photograph of [[Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c]]'s [[self-immolation]], which [[Carsten Jensen]] said is related to ''Persona''{{'s}} themes.]]\nAccording to Singer, Bergman confronts his viewers with \"the nature of his art form\".{{sfn|Singer|2009|p=171}} Literary critic Maria Bergom-Larsson wrote that ''Persona'' reflected Bergman's approach to filmmaking.

She rejects her earlier belief: \"How stupid of me\".{{sfn|Bergom-Larsson|1978|p=72}} As Elisabet studies Alma, Bergman studies them both.{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|1995|p=142}}\n\nMichaels wrote that Bergman and Elisabet share a dilemma: they cannot respond authentically to \"large catastrophes\", such as the [[Holocaust]] or the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Michaels|2000|p=17}} Political columnist [[Carsten Jensen]] identified the Vietnam footage Elisabet sees as the 1963 self-immolation of [[Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c]]. According to Jensen, photographs of Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's death were widely circulated and were used in ''Persona''.{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=273}} Academic Benton Meadows wrote that Elisabet sees herself in Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c's death, fearing that it would be a consequence of her silent rebellion.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Meadows |first=Benton |title=The Hopeless Dream of Being: An Exploration of the Female Gaze in Bergman's Persona |journal=The Corinthian |date=2014 |volume=15 |pp=115\u2013116}}</ref> T\u00f6rnqvist wrote that Elisabet is struck by the truth that the monk is a true rebel, while her rebellion is a cowardly retreat behind a ''persona'' of muteness.{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|2003|p=207}}\n\n===Vampirism===\n[[File:Edvard Munch - Vampire (1893), Gothenburg Museum of Art.jpg|200px|thumb|alt=Painting of a woman kissing a man on the neck|''[[Love and Pain (painting)|Vampire]]'' by [[Edvard Munch]].

The story revolves around a young nurse named Alma (Andersson) and her patient, well-known stage actress Elisabet Vogler (Ullmann), who has suddenly stopped speaking. They move to a cottage, where Alma cares for Elisabet, confides in her and begins having trouble distinguishing herself from her patient.\n\nCharacterized by elements of [[psychological horror]], ''Persona'' has been the subject of much critical analysis, interpretation and debate. The film's exploration of duality, insanity and [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]] has been interpreted as reflecting the [[Jungian]] theory of ''[[persona (psychology)|persona]]'' and dealing with issues related to filmmaking, vampire mythology, lesbianism, motherhood, abortion and other subjects. The experimental style of its prologue and storytelling has also been noted. The enigmatic film has been called the [[Mount Everest]] of cinematic analysis; according to film historian [[Peter Cowie]], \"Everything one says about ''Persona'' may be contradicted; the opposite will also be true\".{{refn|group=n|name=\"Interpretation\"|Professor [[Thomas Elsaesser]] likened the piece to Mount Everest and ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' in his essay for [[The Criterion Collection]].<ref name=\"Elsaesser\">{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3116-the-persistence-of-persona |title=The Persistence of Persona |last=Elsaesser |first=Thomas |date=27 March 2014 |accessdate=20 November 2016 |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121171658/https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3116-the-persistence-of-persona |archivedate=21 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Cowie is quoted by academic Frank Gado and editor Lloyd Michaels, who found some exaggeration in Cowie's claim but agreed with the sentiment of the challenges of interpretation.{{sfn|Michaels|2000|p=5}}{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=340}}}}\n\nBergman wrote ''Persona'' with Ullmann and Andersson in mind for the lead roles and the idea of exploring their identities, and shot the film in [[Stockholm]] and [[F\u00e5r\u00f6]] in 1965. In production, the filmmakers experimented with effects, using smoke and a mirror to frame one scene and combining the lead characters' faces in post-production for one shot. Andersson defended a sexually explicit monologue in the screenplay, and rewrote portions of it.\n \nWhen first released, ''Persona'' was edited because of its controversial subject matter. It received positive reviews, with Swedish media coining the word ''Person(a)kult'' to describe its enthusiastic admirers. It won [[Guldbagge Award for Best Film|Best Film]] at the [[4th Guldbagge Awards]], and was Sweden's entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. The censored content was reinstated in English-language restorations in 2001. Many critics consider ''Persona'' one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]], and it was ranked the fifth-best in ''[[Sight & Sound]]''{{'}}s 1972 poll and 17th in 2012. It also influenced many later directors, including [[Robert Altman]] and [[David Lynch]].\n\n==Plot==\nA projector begins screening a series of images, including a [[crucifixion]], a spider and the killing of a lamb, and a boy wakes up in a hospital or [[morgue]]. He sees a large screen with a blurry image of two women. One of the women may be Alma, a young nurse assigned by a doctor to care for Elisabet Vogler. Elisabet is a stage actress who has suddenly [[muteness|stopped speaking]] and moving, which the doctors have determined is the result of willpower rather than physical or mental illness. In the hospital, Elisabet is distressed by television images of a man's self-immolation during the [[Vietnam War]]. Alma reads her a letter from her husband that contains a photo of their son, and the actress tears the photograph up. The doctor speculates that Elisabet may recover better in a cottage by the sea, and sends her there with Alma.\n\nAt the cottage, Alma tells Elisabet that no one has ever really listened to her before. She talks about her fianc\u00e9, Karl-Henrik, and her first affair. Alma tells a story of how, while she was already in a relationship with Karl-Henrik, she [[Sun tanning|sunbathed]] in the nude with Katarina, a woman she had just met. Two young boys appeared, and Katarina initiated an [[orgy]]. Alma became pregnant, had an [[abortion in Sweden|abortion]] and continues to feel guilty.\n\n[[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 06b.jpg|thumb|alt=Iconic photograph of Jewish women and children being herded out of a building|Stroop Report photograph, found by Elisabet, of Polish Jews captured after the Warsaw Ghetto uprising]]\nAlma drives to town to mail their letters, and notices that Elisabet's is not sealed. She reads it. The letter says that Elisabet is \"studying\" Alma and mentions the nurse's orgy and abortion. Furious, Alma accuses Elisabet of using her for some purpose. In the resulting fight, she threatens to scald Elisabet with boiling water and stops when Elisabet begs her not to. This is the first time Alma is certain the actress has spoken since they met, though she thought Elisabet previously whispered to her when Alma was half-asleep. Alma tells her that she knows she is a terrible person; when Elisabet runs off, Alma chases her and begs for forgiveness. Later, Elisabet looks at the [[Warsaw Ghetto boy|famous photograph]] of Jews arrested in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] from the [[Stroop Report]].\n\nOne night, Alma hears a man outside calling for Elisabet; it is Elisabet's husband. He calls Alma \"Elisabet\" and, though the nurse tells him he is mistaken, they have sex. Alma meets with Elisabet to talk about why Elisabet tore up the photo of her son. Alma tells much of Elisabet's story: that she wanted the only thing she did not have, motherhood, and became pregnant. Regretting her decision, Elisabet attempted a failed [[self-induced abortion]] and gave birth to a boy whom she despises, but her son craves her love. Alma ends the story in distress, asserting her identity and denying that she is Elisabet. She later coaxes Elisabet to say the word \"nothing\", and leaves the cottage as a crew films her.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Interi\u00f6r fr\u00e5n Sophiahemmet - Nordiska Museet - NMA.0053286.jpg|200px|thumb|alt=Old photograph of a hallway with people sitting|''Persona'' was written at the [[Sophiahemmet]] hospital.]]\nAccording to Bergman, the story had its roots in a chance encounter with past collaborator [[Bibi Andersson]]{{refn|group=n|name=\"Andersson\"|Bibi Andersson first starred in Bergman's films in 1957 (''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' and ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'') and ''[[The Devil's Eye]]'' in 1960, with her saying that he often cast her in na\u00efve roles.

Andersson, who was with Liv Ullmann, introduced Ullmann to him.{{sfn|Bergman|2014|p=26}} Ullmann placed the meeting in 1964, and said that Bergman recognized her and asked her on the spot if she would like to work with him.<ref name=\"UllmannBlu\"/> He said that an image of the two women formed in his mind; in the hospital, he found an \"uncanny resemblance\" between the actresses in photographs of them sunbathing. This inspired the beginning of his story, a vision of two women \"wearing big hats and laying their hands alongside each other\".{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=321}} Andersson said, \"Liv and I had worked together before and we were very close\". Bergman had been in a romantic relationship with Andersson and was attracted to Ullmann; of ''Persona''{{'}}s conception, Andersson said, \"He saw our friendship, and he wanted to get ... inside of it.

The actresses were unaware of the effect until a screening in the [[Moviola]].{{sfn|Bergman|2014|pp=31-32}} Neither actress recognized herself in the resulting imagery, each assuming that the shot was of the other.{{refn|group=n|name=\"Moviola\"|Bergman described the Moviola screening, with the actresses unaware of the effect: \"We set the machine running, and Liv said, 'Oh look, what a horrible picture of Bibi!'

According to author Paul Coates, ''Persona'' was the \"aftermath\" of that exploration.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=166}} Gervais added that ''Persona'' and other Bergman films between 1965 and 1970 were not \"God-centred\".{{sfn|Gervais|1999|p=103}} Gervais also quoted philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] as a guide to understanding ''Persona'': \"Belief in the absolute immorality of Nature, in lack of purpose, and in meaninglessness, is the ''affect'' psychologically necessary once belief in God and an essentially moral order is no longer supportable\".{{sfn|Gervais|1999|pp=103-104}}\n\n===Identity and duality===\n[[File:Richard Mansfield Jekyll.png|150px|thumb|left|alt=Double-exposure photograph of late-19th-century actor Richard Mansfield as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Professor [[Irving Singer]] compared Bergman's merged characters to [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]].]]\nAnalysis has focused on the characters' resemblance, demonstrated in shots of overlapping faces in which one face is visible and part of another is seen behind it, suggesting the possibility that the characters are one,<ref name=\"Elsaesser\"/> and their duality.{{sfn|Vermilye|2002|p=124}}{{sfn|Ketcham|1986|p=242}} Critic [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] commented, \"This duality can be embodied in two persons, as it is here, but it has a distinct relevance to the contradictory aspects of a single person\".{{sfn|Simon|1974|p=224}} If they are one person, the questions exist of whether Alma is fantasizing about the actress she admires, Elisabet is examining her psyche, or the boy is trying to understand his mother.{{sfn|Steene|2000|p=40}} [[Susan Sontag]] suggested that ''Persona'' is a series of variations on the theme of \"[[Doubling (psychodrama)|doubling]]\".{{sfn|Sontag|2002|p=1}} According to Sontag, the film's subject is \"violence of the spirit\".{{sfn|Sontag|2002|p=1}} Professor [[Irving Singer]], examining the shot in which Alma and Elisabet's faces are combined, compared its repulsive effect to that of seeing [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s character [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Mr. Hyde]] instead of his benign alter ego, Dr. Jekyll. Singer wrote that Bergman expanded on Stevenson's exploration of duality, the \"[[good and evil]], light and dark aspects of our nature\", depicting it as \"oneness\" in the shot.{{sfn|Singer|2009|p=164}}\n\nGado saw ''Persona'' as a \"double-threaded process of discovery involving motherhood\".{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=342}} Elisabet's withdrawal into silence could be her rejection of motherhood, the only role the actress could not slough off. The nurse realizes that she has done what Elisabet tried and failed to do: erase a child from her life by abortion.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=343}} Psychiatrist Barbara Young viewed the boy in the morgue in the film's prologue as a stand-in for Bergman, in a morgue he remembered, reaching out to his mother.

Bergman agreed, saying that Jung's theory \"fits well in this case\".{{sfn|Denzin|1992|p=28}} Coates also connected masks to themes of identity and duality: \"The mask is [[Janus]]-faced\".{{sfn|Coates|2012|pp=158-172}}\n\nAlma's secret is revealed in her orgy monologue, and critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] related it to a combination of shame and nostalgia perhaps indicating the character's [[sexual liberation]]. According to Wood, the incident touched on unfaithfulness and [[Child sexuality|juvenile sexuality]];{{sfn|Wood|2012|p=265}} in Swedish, the young boys are called \"''[[wiktionary:pojkar|pojkar]]''\" and are in need of coaching.{{sfn|Wood|2012|pp=265-266}} [[Arnold Weinstein (scholar)|Arnold Weinstein]] wrote that Alma's story is the hardest-hitting example of the \"cracks\" in the character's mask, belying her persona of a nurse and leading to a \"collapse of self\".{{sfn|Weinstein|2008|p=302}} Her monologue is so intense that it verges on pornography, although there is no depiction of the sexual escapade.{{sfn|Weinstein|2008|p=302}}\n\nCinema historian [[P. Adams Sitney]] summarized the story as following the course of [[psychoanalysis]]: a referral, followed by the first interview, disclosures and the discovery of the patient's root problem.{{sfn|Sitney|1990|p=131}} According to Sitney, the story seems to begin from Alma's point of view; after Elisabet compares their hands, her point of view is revealed as the source of the story.{{sfn|Sitney|1990|p=129}}\n\nAnother possible reference to psychology is that when Elisabet falls mute, the play she is in is ''Electra'' by [[Electra (Sophocles play)|Sophocles]] or [[Electra (Euripides play)|Euripides]].{{sfn|Sitney|1990|p=143}} According to Wood, Bergman did not focus on [[Greek tragedy]] in his work but the character of [[Electra]] inspired the idea of the [[Electra complex]].{{sfn|Wood|1998|p=251}} Sitney felt that Bergman's choice of play related to \"sexual identities\", a key concept in psychoanalysis.{{sfn|Sitney|1990|p=143}}\n\n===Gender and sexuality===\nThe story fits Bergman's motif of \"warring women\", seen earlier in ''The Silence'' and later in ''Cries and Whispers'' and ''[[Autumn Sonata]]''.{{sfn|Orr|2014|p=67}} According to Professor Marilyn Johns Blackwell, Elisabet's resistance to speaking can be interpreted as resistance to her [[gender roles|gender role]]. By depicting this tension as experienced primarily by women, Bergman may be said to \"problematize the position of woman as other\"; the role society assigns women is \"essentially foreign to their subjecthood\".{{sfn|Blackwell|1997|p=135}} Blackwell wrote that the attraction between Elisabet and Alma and the absence of male sexuality cohere with their identification with each other, creating a doubling that reveals the \"multiple, shifting, self-contradictory identity\" (a notion of identity that undermines male ideology). The theme of merging and doubling surfaces early in the film, when Alma says that she saw one of Elisabet's films and was struck by the thought that they were alike.{{sfn|Blackwell|1997|p=151}} Blackwell also writes that one of the film's original titles, ''A Piece of Cinematography'', may allude to the nature of representation.{{sfn|Blackwell|1997|p=134}}\n\nAnalysts have noted possible lesbian under-{{sfn|Michaels|2000|p=5}} and overtones.{{sfn|Gervais|1999|p=96}} Alison Darren profiled ''Persona'' in her ''Lesbian Film Guide'', calling Alma and Elisabet's relationship \"halfway between love and hate\"; they may come close to having sex in one scene, \"though this might easily be an illusion\".{{sfn|Darren|2000|p=164}} Scholar [[Gwendolyn Audrey Foster]] interpreted the film in [[Feminist theory|feminist]] terms as a depiction of [[lesbian films|lesbianism]], viewing the scene where Elisabet enters Alma's room as seduction.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=138}} Professor Alexis Luko also felt that the characters' touching and resemblance in the scene, in addition to symbolizing their personalities merging, indicated intimacy and eroticism.{{sfn|Luko|2015|p=140}}\n\nFoster believed that Elisabet's gaze presents Alma with questions about her engagement to Karl-Henrik.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=135}} According to Foster, sexual encounters between men and women are associated with abortion; lesbian romance has an increasingly shared identity.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=137}} But if ''Persona'' dramatizes a lesbian relationship, it is not clearly favorable, as it is later characterized by narcissism and violence.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=137}} If lesbianism is considered a stronger version of female friendship, or motherly love, Alma and Elisabet's relationship replaces the depiction of the [[Oedipus complex]] in the prologue when the boy reaches for his mother in vain.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=134}} According to Jeremi Szaniawski, Bergman's use of [[homoeroticism]] (gay and lesbian) in ''Persona'', ''[[Hour of the Wolf]]'', ''Cries and Whispers'' and ''[[Face to Face (1976 film)|Face to Face]]'' was a rebellion against his strict upbringing by [[Church of Sweden]] minister [[Erik Bergman (Lutheran minister)|Erik Bergman]].{{sfn|Szaniawski|2013|p=151}}\n[[File:Tragic mask of terra cotta, with the mouth wide open, representing the \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf, or persona, of the ancients - Dodwell Edward - 1819.jpg|200px|thumb|alt=Front and side views of a tragic mask|[[Edward Dodwell]]'s depiction of an ancient Greek mask]]\n\n===Art and theatre===\n''[[Persona]]'' is the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for \"mask\" and referred to a mouthpiece actors wore to increase the audibility of their lines.

{"title_page": "Stellera", "text_new": "{{Speciesbox\n|image = Stellera chamaejasme 2.jpg\n|display_parents = 2\n|genus = Stellera\n|parent_authority = L.<ref name=IPNI_39323-1/> \n|species = chamaejasme\n|authority = L.<ref name=TPL_Stellera/>\n}}\n\n'''''Stellera''''' is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]] in the family [[Thymelaeaceae]], with a single species '''''Stellera chamaejasme''''',<ref name=TPL_Stellera/> found in mountainous regions of [[Central Asia]], [[Siberia]] and [[South Asia]]. ''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'' is a [[perennial]] plant with heads of white, pink or yellow flowers, grown as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s.\n\n==Description==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is a [[herbaceous perennial]]. Unbranched stems, 20\u201330&nbsp;cm tall, emerge in a cluster from an underground [[rhizome]]. Narrow, overlapping leaves are borne along the stems. Individual leaves are narrow and pointed, up to 2&nbsp;cm long. The flowers are grouped into rounded tightly packed terminal heads. Flowers lack [[petal]]s, instead having petaloid [[sepal]]s forming a tube up to 1.5&nbsp;cm long with usually five (but possibly four or six) short lobes at the end. The flower colour varies from shades of pink and white to yellow. There are twice as many stamens as calyx lobes, in two series. The ovary has a single chamber ([[locule]]). The fruit is a dry [[drupe]], enclosed by the remains of the calyx.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_S/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus ''Stellera'' was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753.<ref name=IPNI_39323-1/>  He recognized two species: ''Stellera passerina'', now placed in the genus ''[[Thymelaea]]'' as ''[[Thymelaea passerina|T.&nbsp;passerina]]'', and ''Stellera chamaejasme''.<ref name=Linn53/> Many species names were later created in the genus, but all are now usually considered synonyms of other species, including ''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'',<ref name=TPL_Stellera/> although the ''Flora of China'' states that there are 10 to 12 species.<ref name=FoC_S/>\n\nStudies in 2002 and 2009, based on [[chloroplast DNA]], placed ''Stellera'' in a small group of related genera, either as sister to ''[[Wikstroemia]]'' or embedded within it; however for most genera only one species was included.<ref name=BankFayChas02/><ref name=BeauEdwaMannMaur09/>\n\n{{clade|style=line-height:100%\n|1={{clade\n   |1=''[[Edgeworthia]]''\n   |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n         |1=''[[Wikstroemia]]''\n         |2=''Stellera''\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=''[[Diarthron]]''\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Thymelaea]]''\n            |2=''[[Daphne (plant)|Daphne]]''\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is native to northern China, Tibet, the Himalayas (Nepal, Bhutan), Uttar Pradesh in India, and Russia and Mongolia.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_Sc/> In China, it is found on sunny dry slopes and sandy places between 2600 and 4200&nbsp;m.<ref name=FoC_Sc/>\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is cultivated as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s. It is considered difficult to grow, needing a sunny position and gritty soil if grown outside, or a large pot if grown under cover. It is propagated by seed.<ref name=Beck94/>\n\n==Toxicity==\n<blockquote>The [[Russian people|Russians]] living in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] still hold Stellera in high esteem on account of its root, despite the fact that its violent effects have already dispatched a good many people to the afterlife. This root resembles a crudely-carved human figure to a degree even greater than that of the [ famous ] ''Alraune'' or [[Mandrake|Mandragora]], such that one can often distinguish clearly in its form a head, arms and legs; which has led to its being given the most apposite name of ''Muzhik koren'' [ \u041c\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043a \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d ] or \"Man root\" by the Russians. The oldest rootstocks of this plant can reach the size of a large carrot, and produce the most violent effects. Such old roots can produce more than fifty and sometimes as many as a hundred flowering shoots, which, crowned with their beautiful and fragrant flowers, give not the least hint of the violent and pernicious effects residing in the root that bore them. The exterior of the flower is usually of a dark reddish-purple, or, more rarely sulphur-yellow colour; while the interior is white. Add to this the fact that the flowers display, upon opening, a white border and in the middle a red or yellow patch, and the flowers present the most ravishing aspect. The young [[Evenk|Tungus]] boys are in the habit of adorning their bare heads with a kind of hat which they create most artistically by interweaving whole flowering stems of the plant. On this plant one often finds a flower in which two normal flowers seem fused into one, bearing a corolla with nine lobes and eighteen stamens arranged in two rows.

''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'' is a [[perennial]] plant with heads of white, pink or yellow flowers, grown as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s.\n\n==Description==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is a [[herbaceous perennial]]. Unbranched stems, 20\u201330&nbsp;cm tall, emerge in a cluster from an underground [[rhizome]]. Narrow, overlapping leaves are borne along the stems. Individual leaves are narrow and pointed, up to 2&nbsp;cm long. The flowers are grouped into rounded tightly packed terminal heads. Flowers lack [[petal]]s, instead having petaloid [[sepal]]s forming a tube up to 1.5&nbsp;cm long with usually five (but possibly four or six) short lobes at the end. The flower colour varies from shades of pink and white to yellow. There are twice as many stamens as calyx lobes, in two series. The ovary has a single chamber ([[locule]]). The fruit is a dry [[drupe]], enclosed by the remains of the calyx.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_S/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus ''Stellera'' was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753.<ref name=IPNI_39323-1/>  He recognized two species: ''Stellera passerina'', now placed in the genus ''[[Thymelaea]]'' as ''[[Thymelaea passerina|T.&nbsp;passerina]]'', and ''Stellera chamaejasme''.<ref name=Linn53/> Many species names were later created in the genus, but all are now usually considered synonyms of other species, including ''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'',<ref name=TPL_Stellera/> although the ''Flora of China'' states that there are 10 to 12 species.<ref name=FoC_S/>\n\nStudies in 2002 and 2009, based on [[chloroplast DNA]], placed ''Stellera'' in a small group of related genera, either as sister to ''[[Wikstroemia]]'' or embedded within it; however for most genera only one species was included.<ref name=BankFayChas02/><ref name=BeauEdwaMannMaur09/>\n\n{{clade|style=line-height:100%\n|1={{clade\n   |1=''[[Edgeworthia]]''\n   |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n         |1=''[[Wikstroemia]]''\n         |2=''Stellera''\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=''[[Diarthron]]''\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Thymelaea]]''\n            |2=''[[Daphne (plant)|Daphne]]''\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is native to northern China, Tibet, the Himalayas (Nepal, Bhutan), Uttar Pradesh in India, and Russia and Mongolia.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_Sc/> In China, it is found on sunny dry slopes and sandy places between 2600 and 4200&nbsp;m.<ref name=FoC_Sc/>\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is cultivated as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s. It is considered difficult to grow, needing a sunny position and gritty soil if grown outside, or a large pot if grown under cover. It is propagated by seed.<ref name=Beck94/>\n\n==Toxicity==\n<blockquote>The [[Russian people|Russians]] living in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] still hold Stellera in high esteem on account of its root, despite the fact that its violent effects have already dispatched a good many people to the afterlife. This root resembles a crudely-carved human figure to a degree even greater than that of the [ famous ] ''Alraune'' or [[Mandrake|Mandragora]], such that one can often distinguish clearly in its form a head, arms and legs; which has led to its being given the most apposite name of ''Muzhik koren'' [ \u041c\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043a \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d ] or \"Man root\" by the Russians. The oldest rootstocks of this plant can reach the size of a large carrot, and produce the most violent effects. Such old roots can produce more than fifty and sometimes as many as a hundred flowering shoots, which, crowned with their beautiful and fragrant flowers, give yet not the least hint of the violent and pernicious effects residing in the root that bore them. The exterior of the flower is usually of a dark reddish-purple, or, more rarely sulphur-yellow colour; while the interior is white. Add to this the fact that the flowers display, upon opening, a white border and in the middle a red or yellow patch, and the flowers present the most ravishing aspect. The young [[Evenk|Tungus]] boys are in the habit of adorning their bare heads with a kind of hat which they create most artistically by interweaving whole flowering stems of the plant. On this plant one often finds a flower in which two normal flowers seem fused into one, bearing a corolla with nine lobes and eighteen stamens arranged in two rows.
