The list begins after the ''[[Adventus Saxonum]]'' in c. AD 446 (when the Anglo-Saxons are said to have arrived in Britain) to the late Middle Ages when Wales was eventually subdued and annexed by England. The list is not exhaustive but seeks to note the significant campaigns and the major battles.\n\n==Fifth Century==\n\n[[Germanic Paganism|Pagan]] Germanic tribes who have colonized parts of the eastern and southern coasts of Britannia attack the Britons (which the Anglo-Saxons dub \"Wealsc\") in a series of coordinated uprisings. Additional reinforcements from [[Old Saxony]], [[Angeln]], [[Flanders]] and [[Jutland]] make landings and through conquest and treaty occupy large areas of eastern and south eastern Britain.\n\n[[File:Public Schools Historical Atlas - Roman Britain 400.jpg|frameless|right|241px]]\n\n* c.452 The Germanic people settled on the eastern \"[[Saxon Shore]]\" of Britain rise in a revolt led by [[Hengest]] and his sons against their Romano British masters.\n* c.455 ''Battle of Aylesford'' \u2013 [[Anglo-Saxon]]s (particularly a group called [[Jutes]]) led by [[Hengest]] defeat the Britons (Welsh) led by [[Vortimer]] in Battle at Aylesford, Kent.\n* c.456 ''Battle of Crayford'' \u2013 Anglo-Saxons ([[Jute]]s) led again by Hengest defeat the Britons (Welsh) led by [[Vortimer]] in battle. The Britons are driven from ([[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]]) which is afterwards ruled by Hengist and his son [[Oisc of Kent|\u00c6sc]] and their descendants.\n* c.466 ''[[Battle of Wippedsfleot]]'' \u2013 Britons (Welsh) perhaps defeat the Anglo-Saxons (Jutes) in battle in Kent and confine them to the [[Isle of Thanet]].\n* c.473 The Anglo-Saxons (Jutes) move westwards and drive the Britons once again out of Kent.\n* c.477 ''Battle of [[Cymenshore|Cymensora]]'' \u2013 Anglo-Saxons ([[Saxon]]s) led by [[\u00c6lle of Sussex|\u00c6lle]] defeat the Britons (Welsh) close to [[Selsey]].\n* c.486 ''Battle on the River Glein'' \u2013 Arthur of the Britons is reputed to have defeated the Anglo-Saxons.\n* c.490 Second, third and fourth battles of Arthur in ''Linnuis'' thought to be modern [[Lindsey (government district)|Lindsey]] where he led the Britons to defeat the Anglo-Saxons at each battle.\n* c.491 ''Siege of [[Anderida]]'' \u2013 Anglo-Saxons (Saxons) led by \u00c6lle capture the Castle of Anderida from the Britons (Welsh) and slaughter the inhabitants. \u00c6lle establishes the Kingdom of the [[South Saxons]] (Sussex).\n* c.492 ''Battle of Bassas'' \u2013 Arthur defeats the Anglo-Saxons at an unidentified location.\n* c.493 ''Battle of Guinnion'' \u2013 Arthur defeats the Anglo-Saxons in battle. The site was probably at [[Winchester]] which was then known as ''Caer Guintguic''.\n* c.495 ''Battle of Urbe Legionis'' \u2013 Arthur defeats the Anglo-Saxons in battle at the \"City of the Legions\" which is thought to probably by [[Chester]].\n* c.495 A man named [[Cerdic]] reputedly defeats the Britons (Welsh) in battle close to modern day [[Bournemouth]] and establishes kingdom of the [[West Saxons]] (Wessex).\n* c.496 ''Battle of [[Mons Badonicus]]'' \u2013 The Anglo-Saxons are soundly defeated in battle by the Britons (possibly led by [[King Arthur]]) at a site generally thought to be close to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. This defeat establishes 50 years of relative peace.\n\n==Sixth Century==\n[[File:Britain.circa.540.jpg|frameless|right|241px]]\n\nPagan Anglo-Saxon tribes conquer southern Britain capturing [[London]], [[Colchester]], [[Silchester]], [[Chichester]], [[Winchester]], [[Grantchester]], [[Leicester]], [[Gloucester]], [[Cirencester]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[York]], [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Canterbury]] among other places.

The Welsh of the Severn Valley attempted to retake this strategic location but were defeated with three of their kings killed in the fighting. The West Saxons went on to capture [[Gloucester]], [[Cirencester]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] thus separating the \"West Welsh\"  of the [[South West Peninsula]] from the Welsh of modern Wales.\n* 580 ''Battle of Ebrauc'' where the Angles of [[Bernicia]] capture the city of [[Ebrauc]] (modern [[York]]).\n* 584 ''Battle of Tintern'' where the armies of the [[Kingdom of Gwent]], led by [[Tewdrig]] and his son [[Meurig]] defeated the West Saxons and forced them to retreat from the [[Gloucester]] area. Tewdrig was mortally wounded and died three days after the battle.\n* 590 the northern alliance of the Britons is defeated following the assassination of their leader and divisions between the former allies.\n* 598 ''Battle of [[Catterick, North Yorkshire|Catraeth]]'' \u2013 the northern Angles led by [[Aethelfrith of Northumbria|\u00c6thelfrith]] destroy the remaining forces of the Britons of Gododdin and Bryneich (Bernicia).\n\n==Seventh Century==\n[[File:Yr.Hen.Ogledd.550.650.Koch.jpg|frameless|right|241px]]\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons consolidate their hold on southern and eastern Britain. The [[Mercia]]n Angles made substantial gains in central Britain (today known as the [[English Midlands]]). [[Cambria]] is cut off from the Britons of the north west and the south west. The Anglo-Saxons convert to [[Christianity]] by the middle of the century. The last serious attempts by the Welsh to reclaim Britain fail.\n\n* 614 ''Battle of Beandun'' \u2013 The West Saxons led by [[Cynegils]] defeat the West Welsh, possibly led by Tewdwr ap Peredur, at [[Badbury Rings]], [[Dorset]]. In what is likely to have been a siege over two thousand Welsh warriors died following the capture of the fort. After this battle it is likely Dorset was annexed by Wessex.\n* 616 ''[[Battle of Chester]]'' \u2013 the Northern Angles of Northumbria led by [[Aethelfrith of Northumbria]] defeat an alliance of Powys and Gwynedd and capture the city of [[Chester]] amid great slaughter.\n* 619 The united [[Northumbria]]n Angles led by [[Edwin of Northumbria]] invade and conquer [[Elmet]], a Welsh territory close to modern [[Leeds]]. The Kingdom of Elmet is occupied and its last ruler, [[Ceretic of Elmet|Ceretic]], is driven into exile in Powys where soon after he dies.\n* 629 The Northumbrians invade Gwynedd and drive [[Cadwallon ap Cadfan]] into exile.\n* 630 The Battle of Pont y Saeson Tewdrig King of Gwent together with Meurig, took up arms and drove back the Saxons\n* 630 \"The Battle of Cefn Digoll, also known as the Battle of the Long Mynd was a battle fought in 630 at Long Mountain near Welshpool . \n* 633 ''[[Battle of Hatfield Chase]]'' near [[Doncaster]]. The battle was fought between the Northumbrian army of King Edwin and an anti-Northumbrian alliance between King Cadwallon of Gwynedd and Penda of Mercia.The battle ended in the death of Edwin and of Northumbrian domination of Gwynedd, and preceded a Welsh campaign into Northumbria.

{"title_page": "Rare Earth hypothesis", "text_new": "{{bots|deny=InternetArchiveBot}}\n{{Short description|Hypothesis that complex extraterrestrial life is improbable and extremely rare}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2016}}\n\n[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that planets with complex life, like [[Earth]], are exceptionally rare]]\nIn [[planetary astronomy]] and [[astrobiology]], the '''Rare Earth hypothesis''' argues that the [[origin of life]] and the [[evolution of biological complexity]] such as [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]], [[multicellular organism]]s on [[Earth]] (and, subsequently, [[human intelligence]]) required an improbable combination of [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] and [[geology|geological]] events and circumstances.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, complex [[extraterrestrial life]] is an improbable phenomenon and likely to be rare. The term \"Rare Earth\" originates from ''[[Rare Earth (book)|Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe]]'' (2000), a book by [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]], a geologist and paleontologist, and [[Donald E. Brownlee]], an astronomer and astrobiologist, both faculty members at the [[University of Washington]].\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Frank Drake]], among others, argued that Earth is a typical [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planet]] in a typical [[planetary system]], located in a non-exceptional region of a common [[barred-spiral galaxy]]. From the [[principle of mediocrity]] (extended from the [[Copernican principle]]), they argued that we are typical, and the universe teems with complex life. However, Ward and Brownlee argue that planets, planetary systems, and galactic regions that are as friendly to complex life as the Earth, the [[Solar System]], and our [[Milky Way|galactic]] region are rare.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Requirements for complex life==\n{{Life timeline}}\nThe Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the [[evolution of biological complexity]] requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a [[galactic habitable zone]], a central star and planetary system having the requisite character, the [[circumstellar habitable zone]], a right-sized terrestrial planet, the advantage of a gas giant guardian like Jupiter and a large [[natural satellite]], conditions needed to ensure the planet has a [[magnetosphere]] and [[plate tectonics]], the chemistry of the [[lithosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and oceans, the role of \"evolutionary pumps\" such as massive [[glaciation]] and rare [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] impacts, and whatever led to the appearance of the [[eukaryote]] [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[sexual reproduction]] and the [[Cambrian explosion]] of [[animal]], [[plant]], and [[fungi]] [[phylum|phyla]]. The [[evolution of human intelligence]] may have required yet further events, which are extremely unlikely to have happened were it not for the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago removing [[dinosaurs]] as the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s.\n\nIn order for a small rocky planet to support complex life, Ward and Brownlee argue, the values of several variables must fall within narrow ranges. The [[universe]] is so vast that it could contain many Earth-like planets. But if such planets exist, they are likely to be separated from each other by many thousands of [[light year]]s. Such distances may preclude communication among any intelligent species evolving on such planets, which would solve the [[Fermi paradox]]: \"If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?\"<ref name=\"Webb, Stephen 2002\">{{harvnb|Webb|2002}}</ref>\n\n===The right location in the right kind of galaxy===\n''Rare Earth'' suggests that much of the known universe, including large parts of our galaxy, are \"dead zones\" unable to support complex life. Those parts of a galaxy where complex life is possible make up the [[galactic habitable zone]], primarily characterized by distance from the [[Galactic Center]]. As that distance increases:\n# Star [[metallicity]] declines. Metals (which in astronomy means all elements other than hydrogen and helium) are necessary to the formation of [[terrestrial planets]].\n# The [[X-ray]] and [[gamma ray]] radiation from the [[Supermassive black hole|black hole]] at the galactic center, and from nearby [[neutron star]]s, becomes less intense. Thus the early universe, and present-day galactic regions where stellar density is high and [[supernova]]e are common, will be dead zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=27\u201329}}</ref>\n# Gravitational perturbation of planets and [[planetesimal]]s by nearby stars becomes less likely as the density of stars decreases. Hence the further a planet lies from the Galactic Center or a spiral arm, the less likely it is to be struck by a large [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] which could [[Extinction event|extinguish]] all complex life on a planet.\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center |align=left |direction=vertical |image1=NGC 7331 zoomed.jpg |width1=150px |caption1=Dense centers of galaxies such as [[NGC 7331]] (often referred to as a \"twin\" of the [[Milky Way]]<ref>[http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2004-12/ssc2004-12a.shtml 1 Morphology of Our Galaxy's 'Twin'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215171141/http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2004-12/ssc2004-12a.shtml |date=15 February 2006 }} Spitzer Space Telescope, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA.</ref>) have high radiation levels toxic to complex life. |image2=A Swarm of Ancient Stars - GPN-2000-000930.jpg |width2=150px |caption2=According to Rare Earth, [[globular clusters]] are unlikely to support life.}}\n<!---\n[[File:NGC 7331 zoomed.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The dense centre of galaxies such as [[NGC 7331]] (often referred to as a \"twin\" of the [[Milky Way]]<ref>[http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2004-12/ssc2004-12a.shtml 1 Morphology of Our Galaxy's 'Twin'] Spitzer Space Telescope, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA.</ref>) have high levels of radiation which are dangerous to complex life]]\n[[File:A Swarm of Ancient Stars - GPN-2000-000930.jpg|thumb|left|150px|According to Rare Earth, globular clusters are unlikely to support life.]]\n--->\nItem #1 rules out the outer reaches of a galaxy; #2 and #3 rule out galactic inner regions. Hence a galaxy's habitable zone may be a ring sandwiched between its uninhabitable center and outer reaches.\n\nAlso, a habitable planetary system must maintain its favorable location long enough for complex life to evolve. A star with an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] (elliptic or hyperbolic) galactic orbit will pass through some spiral arms, unfavorable regions of high star density; thus a life-bearing star must have a galactic orbit that is nearly circular, with a close synchronization between the orbital velocity of the star and of the spiral arms. This further restricts the galactic habitable zone within a fairly narrow range of distances from the Galactic Center.

However, the majority of stars in barred spiral galaxies populate the spiral arms rather than the halo and tend to move in [[gravitationally aligned orbits]], so there is little that is unusual about the Sun's orbit. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a spiral arm since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major spiral arm approximately every 100 million years.<ref>[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/55-our-solar-system/the-sun/the-sun-in-the-milky-way/207-how-often-does-the-sun-pass-through-a-spiral-arm-in-the-milky-way-intermediate How often does the Sun pass through a spiral arm in the Milky Way?], Karen Masters, ''Curious About Astronomy''</ref> Some researchers have suggested that several mass extinctions do correspond with previous crossings of the spiral arms.<ref>{{harvnb|Dartnell|2007|p=75}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiting at the right distance from the right type of star===\n[[File:Estimated extent of the Solar Systems habitable zone.png|thumb|According to the hypothesis, Earth has an improbable orbit in the very narrow habitable zone (dark green) around the Sun.]]\nThe terrestrial example suggests that complex life requires liquid water, requiring an orbital distance neither too close nor too far from the central star, another scale of [[habitable zone]] or [[Goldilocks Principle]]:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hart, M.H. |title=Habitable Zones Around Main Sequence Stars |journal=Icarus |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=351\u20137 |date=January 1979 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(79)90141-6 |bibcode=1979Icar...37..351H}}</ref> \nThe habitable zone varies with the star's type and age.\n\nFor advanced life, the star must also be highly stable, which is typical of middle star life, about 4.6 billion years old.

To date no [[Solar analog#Solar twin|solar twin]] star, with an exact match of the sun's luminosity variation, has been found, though some come close. The star must have no stellar companions, as in [[Binary star|binary systems]], which would disrupt the orbits of planets. Estimates suggest 50% or more of all star systems are binary.<ref>[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/08jan_sunclimate/ NASA, Science News, Solar Variability and Terrestrial Climate, 8 January 2013]</ref><ref name=\"astro.unl.edu\">[http://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/stellarprops/stellarlum.html University of Nebraska-Lincoln astronomy education group, Stellar Luminosity Calculator]</ref><ref name=\"nap.edu\">[http://www.nap.edu/catalog/13519/the-effects-of-solar-variability-on-earths-climate-a-workshop National Center for Atmospheric Research, The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth's Climate, 2012 Report]</ref><ref>[http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/06/05/most-of-earths-twins-arent-identical-or-even-close/ Most of Earth\u2019s twins aren\u2019t identical, or even close!, by Ethan on 5 June 2013]</ref> The habitable zone for a main sequence star very gradually moves out over its lifespan until it becomes a white dwarf and the habitable zone vanishes.\n\nThe liquid water and other gases available in the habitable zone bring the benefit of [[Greenhouse effect|greenhouse warming]]. Even though the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] contains a water vapor concentration from 0% (in arid regions) to 4% (in rain forest and ocean regions) and \u2013 as of February 2018 \u2013 only 408.05{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} parts per million of {{CO2}}, these small amounts suffice to raise the average surface temperature by about 40&nbsp;\u00b0C,<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=18}}</ref> with the dominant contribution being due to water vapor, which together with clouds makes up between 66% and 85% of Earth's greenhouse effect, with {{CO2}} contributing between 9% and 26% of the effect.<ref>{{cite web |first=Gavin |last=Schmidt |title=Water vapour: feedback or forcing? |date=6 April 2005 |publisher=RealClimate |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/04/water-vapour-feedback-or-forcing/}}</ref>\n\nRocky planets must orbit within the habitable zone for life to form. Although the habitable zone of such hot stars as [[Sirius]] or [[Vega]] is wide, hot stars also emit much more [[ultraviolet radiation]] that [[ionize]]s any planetary [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. They may become [[red giant]]s before advanced life [[Evolution|evolve]]s on their planets.\nThese considerations rule out the massive and powerful stars of type F6 to O (see [[stellar classification]]) as homes to evolved [[metazoan life]].\n\nSmall [[red dwarf]] stars conversely have small [[habitable zone]]s wherein planets are in [[tidal lock]], with one very hot side always facing the star and another very cold side; and they are also at increased risk of solar flares (see [[Aurelia and Blue Moon#Aurelia|Aurelia]]). Life probably cannot arise in such systems. Rare Earth proponents claim that only stars from F7 to K1 types are hospitable. Such stars are rare: G type stars such as the Sun (between the hotter F and cooler K) comprise only 9%<ref name=\"RECONS1\">[http://joy.chara.gsu.edu/RECONS/TOP100.posted.htm] The One Hundred Nearest Star Systems, Research Consortium on Nearby Stars.</ref> of the hydrogen-burning stars in the Milky Way.\n\nSuch aged stars as [[red giant]]s and [[white dwarf]]s are also unlikely to support life. Red giants are common in globular clusters and [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. White dwarfs are mostly dying stars that have already completed their red giant phase. Stars that become red giants expand into or overheat the habitable zones of their youth and middle age (though theoretically planets at a much greater distance [[Red giant#Prospects for habitability|may become habitable]]).\n\nAn energy output that varies with the lifetime of the star will likely prevent life (e.g., as [[Cepheid variable]]s). A sudden decrease, even if brief, may freeze the water of orbiting planets, and a significant increase may evaporate it and cause a [[greenhouse effect]] that prevents the oceans from reforming.\n\nAll known life requires the complex chemistry of [[metallicity|metallic]] elements. The [[absorption spectrum]] of a star reveals the presence of metals within, and studies of stellar spectra reveal that many, perhaps most, stars are poor in metals. Because heavy metals originate in [[supernova]] explosions, metallicity increases in the universe over time. Low metallicity characterizes the early universe: globular clusters and other stars that formed when the universe was young, stars in most galaxies other than large [[spiral galaxy|spirals]], and stars in the outer regions of all galaxies. Metal-rich central stars capable of supporting complex life are therefore believed to be most common in the quiet suburbs{{vague|date=March 2017}} of the larger spiral galaxies\u2014where radiation also happens to be weak.<ref name=\"Ward 2000 15\u201333\">{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=15\u201333}}</ref>\n\n===The right arrangement of planets===\n[[File:Planets2013.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of the Sun and planets of the Solar System and the sequence of planets.

Most planetary systems have super Earths, several times larger than Earth, close to their star, whereas our Solar System's inner region has only a few small rocky planets and none inside Mercury's orbit. Only 10% of stars have giant planets similar to Jupiter and Saturn, and those few rarely have stable nearly circular orbits distant from their star. [[Konstantin Batygin]] and colleagues argue that these features can be explained if, early in the history of the Solar System, Jupiter and Saturn drifted towards the Sun, sending showers of planetesimals towards the super-Earths which sent them spiralling into the Sun, and ferrying icy building blocks into the terrestrial region of the Solar System which provided the building blocks for the rocky planets. The two giant planets then drifted out again to their present position. However, in the view of Batygin and his colleagues: \"The concatenation of chance events required for this delicate choreography suggest that small, Earth-like rocky planets \u2013 and perhaps life itself \u2013 could be rare throughout the cosmos.\"<ref>Batygin et al., pp. 23-24</ref>\n\n===A continuously stable orbit===\nRare Earth argues that a gas giant must not be too close to a body where life is developing.

A planet with a large tilt will experience extreme seasonal variations in climate. A planet with little or no tilt will lack the stimulus to evolution that climate variation provides.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In this view, the Earth's tilt is \"just right\".

A further theory indicates that such a large moon may also contribute to maintaining a planet's magnetic shield by continually acting upon a metallic planetary core as dynamo, thus protecting the surface of the planet from charged particles and cosmic rays, and helping to ensure the atmosphere is not stripped over time by solar winds.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:Earth's atmosphere.svg|thumb|right|Earth's atmosphere]]\n\n===Atmosphere===\nA terrestrial planet of the right size is needed to retain an atmosphere, like Earth and Venus.

Biochemist [[Nick Lane]] argues that simple cells ([[prokaryote]]s) emerged soon after Earth's formation, but since almost half the planet's life had passed before they evolved into complex ones ([[eukaryote]]s) all of whom share a [[common ancestor]], this event can only have happened once. In some views, [[prokaryote]]s lack the cellular architecture to evolve into eukaryotes because a bacterium expanded up to eukaryotic proportions would have tens of thousands of times less energy available; two billion years ago, one simple cell incorporated itself into another, multiplied, and evolved into [[mitochondria]] that supplied the vast increase in available energy that enabled the evolution of complex life. If this incorporation occurred only once in four billion years or is otherwise unlikely, then life on most planets remains simple.<ref>Lane, 2012</ref> An alternative view is that mitochondria evolution was environmentally triggered, and that mitochondria-containing organisms appeared soon after the first traces of atmospheric oxygen.<ref>Martin, W. & Mentel, M.

Relative to the age of the Solar System (~4.57 Ga) this is a short time, in which extreme climatic variations, super volcanoes, and large meteorite impacts were absent. These events would severely harm intelligent life, as well as life in general. For example, the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic mass extinction]], caused by widespread and continuous volcanic eruptions in an area the size of Western Europe, led to the extinction of 95% of known species around 251.2 [[Mega-annum|Ma]] ago. About 65 million years ago, the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]] impact at the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]] (~65.5 Ma) on the [[Yucat\u00e1n peninsula]] in [[Mexico]] led to a mass extinction of the most advanced species at that time.\n\n==Rare Earth equation==\nThe following discussion is adapted from Cramer.<ref>{{harvnb|Cramer|2000}}</ref> The Rare Earth equation is Ward and Brownlee's [[riposte]] to the [[Drake equation]]. It calculates <math>N</math>, the number of Earth-like planets in the Milky Way having complex life forms, as:\n[[File:Pikaia gracilens B.jpg|thumb|upright|According to Rare Earth, the Cambrian explosion that saw extreme diversification of [[chordata]] from simple forms like Pikaia (pictured) was an improbable event]]\n:<math>N=N^* \\cdot n_e \\cdot f_g \\cdot f_p \\cdot f_{pm} \\cdot f_i \\cdot f_c \\cdot f_l \\cdot f_m \\cdot f_j \\cdot f_{me}</math><ref>{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=271\u20135}}</ref>\n\nwhere:\n* ''N*'' is the number of stars in the [[Milky Way]]. This number is not well-estimated, because the Milky Way's mass is not well estimated, with little information about the number of small stars. ''N*'' is at least 100 billion, and may be as high as 500 billion, if there are many low visibility stars.\n* <math>n_e</math> is the average number of planets in a star's habitable zone. This zone is fairly narrow, because constrained by the requirement that the average planetary temperature be consistent with water remaining liquid throughout the time required for complex life to evolve. Thus <math>n_e</math>=1 is a likely upper bound.\nWe assume <math>N^* \\cdot n_e=5\\cdot10^{11}</math>. The Rare Earth hypothesis can then be viewed as asserting that the product of the other nine Rare Earth equation factors listed below, which are all fractions, is no greater than 10<sup>\u221210</sup> and could plausibly be as small as 10<sup>\u221212</sup>. In the latter case, <math>N</math> could be as small as 0 or 1. Ward and Brownlee do not actually calculate the value of <math>N</math>, because the numerical values of quite a few of the factors below can only be conjectured. They cannot be estimated simply because [[Anthropic principle|we have but one data point]]: the Earth, a rocky planet orbiting a [[Stellar classification#Class G|G2]] star in a quiet suburb of a large [[barred spiral galaxy]], and the home of the only intelligent species we know, namely ourselves.\n* <math>f_g</math> is the fraction of stars in the galactic habitable zone (Ward, Brownlee, and Gonzalez estimate this factor as 0.1<ref name=Gonzalez/>).\n* <math>f_p</math> is the fraction of stars in the [[Milky Way]] with planets.\n* <math>f_{pm}</math> is the fraction of planets that are rocky (\"metallic\") rather than gaseous.\n* <math>f_i</math> is the fraction of habitable planets where microbial life arises. Ward and Brownlee believe this fraction is unlikely to be small.\n* <math>f_c</math> is the fraction of planets where complex life evolves. For 80% of the time since microbial life first appeared on the Earth, there was only bacterial life. Hence Ward and Brownlee argue that this fraction may be small.\n* <math>f_l</math> is the fraction of the total lifespan of a planet during which complex life is present. Complex life cannot endure indefinitely, because the energy put out by the sort of star that allows complex life to emerge gradually rises, and the central star eventually becomes a [[red giant]], engulfing all planets in the planetary habitable zone. Also, given enough time, a catastrophic extinction of all complex life becomes ever more likely.\n* <math>f_m</math> is the fraction of habitable planets with a large moon. If the [[giant impact theory]] of the Moon's origin is correct, this fraction is small.\n* <math>f_j</math> is the fraction of planetary systems with large Jovian planets. This fraction could be large.\n* <math>f_{me}</math> is the fraction of planets with a sufficiently low number of extinction events. Ward and Brownlee argue that the low number of such events the Earth has experienced since the [[Cambrian explosion]] may be unusual, in which case this fraction would be small.\n\nThe Rare Earth equation, unlike the [[Drake equation]], does not factor the probability that complex life evolves into [[intelligence|intelligent life]] that discovers technology. Barrow and Tipler<ref>{{BarrowTipler1986}} Section 3.2</ref> review the consensus among such biologists that the evolutionary path from primitive Cambrian [[chordate]]s, e.g., ''[[Pikaia]]'' to ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', was a highly improbable event. For example, the large [[brain]]s of humans have marked adaptive disadvantages, requiring as they do an expensive [[metabolism]], a long [[gestation period]], and a childhood lasting more than 25% of the average total life span. Other improbable features of humans include:\n*Being one of a handful of extant [[bipedal]] land (non-avian) [[vertebrate]].

Larger secondary bodies would exert proportionally larger tidal forces that would in turn decelerate their primaries faster and potentially increase the solar day of a planet in all other respects like Earth to over 120 hours within a few billion years. This long solar day would make effective heat dissipation for organisms in the tropics and subtropics extremely difficult in a similar manner to tidal locking to a red dwarf star.

The term \"Rare Earth\" originates from ''[[Rare Earth (book)|Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe]]'' (2000), a book by [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]], a geologist and paleontologist, and [[Donald E. Brownlee]], an astronomer and astrobiologist, both faculty members at the [[University of Washington]].\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Frank Drake]], among others, argued that Earth is a typical [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planet]] in a typical [[planetary system]], located in a non-exceptional region of a common [[barred-spiral galaxy]]. From the [[principle of mediocrity]] (extended from the [[Copernican principle]]), they argued that we are typical, and the universe teems with complex life. However, Ward and Brownlee argue that planets, planetary systems, and galactic regions that are as friendly to complex life as the Earth, the [[Solar System]], and our [[Milky Way|galactic]] region are rare.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Requirements for complex life==\n{{Life timeline}}\nThe Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the [[evolution of biological complexity]] requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a [[galactic habitable zone]], a central star and planetary system having the requisite character, the [[circumstellar habitable zone]], a right-sized terrestrial planet, the advantage of a gas giant guardian like Jupiter and a large [[natural satellite]], conditions needed to ensure the planet has a [[magnetosphere]] and [[plate tectonics]], the chemistry of the [[lithosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and oceans, the role of \"evolutionary pumps\" such as massive [[glaciation]] and rare [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] impacts, and whatever led to the appearance of the [[eukaryote]] [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[sexual reproduction]] and the [[Cambrian explosion]] of [[animal]], [[plant]], and [[fungi]] [[phylum|phyla]]. The [[evolution of human intelligence]] may have required yet further events, which are extremely unlikely to have happened were it not for the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago removing [[dinosaurs]] as the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s.\n\nIn order for a small rocky planet to support complex life, Ward and Brownlee argue, the values of several variables must fall within narrow ranges. The [[universe]] is so vast that it could contain many Earth-like planets. But if such planets exist, they are likely to be separated from each other by many thousands of [[light year]]s. Such distances may preclude communication among any intelligent species evolving on such planets, which would solve the [[Fermi paradox]]: \"If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?\"<ref name=\"Webb, Stephen 2002\">{{harvnb|Webb|2002}}</ref>\n\n===The right location in the right kind of galaxy===\n''Rare Earth'' suggests that much of the known universe, including large parts of our galaxy, are \"dead zones\" unable to support complex life. Those parts of a galaxy where complex life is possible make up the [[galactic habitable zone]], primarily characterized by distance from the [[Galactic Center]]. As that distance increases:\n# Star [[metallicity]] declines.

Although the habitable zone of such hot stars as [[Sirius]] or [[Vega]] is wide, hot stars also emit much more [[ultraviolet radiation]] that [[ionize]]s any planetary [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. They may become [[red giant]]s before advanced life [[Evolution|evolve]]s on their planets.\nThese considerations rule out the massive and powerful stars of type F6 to O (see [[stellar classification]]) as homes to evolved [[metazoan life]].\n\nSmall [[red dwarf]] stars conversely have small [[habitable zone]]s wherein planets are in [[tidal lock]], with one very hot side always facing the star and another very cold side; and they are also at increased risk of solar flares (see [[Aurelia and Blue Moon#Aurelia|Aurelia]]). Life therefore cannot arise in such systems. Rare Earth proponents claim that only stars from F7 to K1 types are hospitable. Such stars are rare: G type stars such as the Sun (between the hotter F and cooler K) comprise only 9%<ref name=\"RECONS1\">[http://joy.chara.gsu.edu/RECONS/TOP100.posted.htm] The One Hundred Nearest Star Systems, Research Consortium on Nearby Stars.</ref> of the hydrogen-burning stars in the Milky Way.\n\nSuch aged stars as [[red giant]]s and [[white dwarf]]s are also unlikely to support life. Red giants are common in globular clusters and [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. White dwarfs are mostly dying stars that have already completed their red giant phase. Stars that become red giants expand into or overheat the habitable zones of their youth and middle age (though theoretically planets at a much greater distance [[Red giant#Prospects for habitability|may become habitable]]).\n\nAn energy output that varies with the lifetime of the star will likely prevent life (e.g., as [[Cepheid variable]]s). A sudden decrease, even if brief, may freeze the water of orbiting planets, and a significant increase may evaporate it and cause a [[greenhouse effect]] that prevents the oceans from reforming.\n\nAll known life requires the complex chemistry of [[metallicity|metallic]] elements. The [[absorption spectrum]] of a star reveals the presence of metals within, and studies of stellar spectra reveal that many, perhaps most, stars are poor in metals. Because heavy metals originate in [[supernova]] explosions, metallicity increases in the universe over time. Low metallicity characterizes the early universe: globular clusters and other stars that formed when the universe was young, stars in most galaxies other than large [[spiral galaxy|spirals]], and stars in the outer regions of all galaxies. Metal-rich central stars capable of supporting complex life are therefore believed to be most common in the quiet suburbs{{vague|date=March 2017}} of the larger spiral galaxies\u2014where radiation also happens to be weak.<ref name=\"Ward 2000 15\u201333\">{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=15\u201333}}</ref>\n\n===The right arrangement of planets===\n[[File:Planets2013.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of the Sun and planets of the Solar System and the sequence of planets.

Most planetary systems have super Earths, several times larger than Earth, close to their star, whereas our Solar System's inner region has only a few small rocky planets and none inside Mercury's orbit. Only 10% of stars have giant planets similar to Jupiter and Saturn, and those few rarely have stable nearly circular orbits distant from their star. [[Konstantin Batygin]] and colleagues argue that these features can be explained if, early in the history of the Solar System, Jupiter and Saturn drifted towards the Sun, sending showers of planetesimals towards the super-Earths which sent them spiralling into the Sun, and ferrying icy building blocks into the terrestrial region of the Solar System which provided the building blocks for the rocky planets. The two giant planets then drifted out again to their present position. However, in the view of Batygin and his colleagues: \"The concatenation of chance events required for this delicate choreography suggest that small, Earth-like rocky planets \u2013 and perhaps life itself \u2013 could be rare throughout the cosmos.\"<ref>Batygin et al., pp. 23-24</ref>\n\n===A continuously stable orbit===\nRare Earth argues that a gas giant must not be too close to a body where life is developing.

[[Charles Darwin]] was the first to suggest that [[sexual selection]] drives [[speciation]]; without it, complex life would probably not have evolved.\n\n===The right time in evolution===\n[[File:Timeline evolution of life.svg|left|thumb|Timeline of evolution; [[History of writing|human writings]] exists for only 0.000218% of Earth's history.]] \nWhile life on Earth is regarded to have spawned relatively early in the planet's history, the evolution from multicellular to intelligent organisms took around 800 million years.<ref>{{in lang|en}} [http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~ulm/papers/ECh7.pdf 800 million years for complex organ evolution] - [[Heidelberg University]]</ref> Civilizations on Earth have existed for about 12,000 years and radio communication reaching space has existed for less than 100 years. Relative to the age of the Solar System (~4.57 Ga) this is a short time, in which extreme climatic variations, super volcanoes, and large meteorite impacts were absent. These events would severely harm intelligent life, as well as life in general. For example, the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic mass extinction]], caused by widespread and continuous volcanic eruptions in an area the size of Western Europe, led to the extinction of 95% of known species around 251.2 [[Mega-annum|Ma]] ago. About 65 million years ago, the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]] impact at the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]] (~65.5 Ma) on the [[Yucat\u00e1n peninsula]] in [[Mexico]] led to a mass extinction of the most advanced species at that time.\n\n==Rare Earth equation==\nThe following discussion is adapted from Cramer.<ref>{{harvnb|Cramer|2000}}</ref> The Rare Earth equation is Ward and Brownlee's [[riposte]] to the [[Drake equation]]. It calculates <math>N</math>, the number of Earth-like planets in the Milky Way having complex life forms, as:\n[[File:Pikaia gracilens B.jpg|thumb|upright|According to Rare Earth, the Cambrian explosion that saw extreme diversification of [[chordata]] from simple forms like Pikaia (pictured) was an improbable event]]\n:<math>N=N^* \\cdot n_e \\cdot f_g \\cdot f_p \\cdot f_{pm} \\cdot f_i \\cdot f_c \\cdot f_l \\cdot f_m \\cdot f_j \\cdot f_{me}</math><ref>{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=271\u20135}}</ref>\n\nwhere:\n* ''N*'' is the number of stars in the [[Milky Way]]. This number is not well-estimated, because the Milky Way's mass is not well estimated, with little information about the number of small stars. ''N*'' is at least 100 billion, and may be as high as 500 billion, if there are many low visibility stars.\n* <math>n_e</math> is the average number of planets in a star's habitable zone. This zone is fairly narrow, because constrained by the requirement that the average planetary temperature be consistent with water remaining liquid throughout the time required for complex life to evolve. Thus <math>n_e</math>=1 is a likely upper bound.\nWe assume <math>N^* \\cdot n_e=5\\cdot10^{11}</math>. The Rare Earth hypothesis can then be viewed as asserting that the product of the other nine Rare Earth equation factors listed below, which are all fractions, is no greater than 10<sup>\u221210</sup> and could plausibly be as small as 10<sup>\u221212</sup>. In the latter case, <math>N</math> could be as small as 0 or 1. Ward and Brownlee do not actually calculate the value of <math>N</math>, because the numerical values of quite a few of the factors below can only be conjectured. They cannot be estimated simply because [[Anthropic principle|we have but one data point]]: the Earth, a rocky planet orbiting a [[Stellar classification#Class G|G2]] star in a quiet suburb of a large [[barred spiral galaxy]], and the home of the only intelligent species we know, namely ourselves.\n* <math>f_g</math> is the fraction of stars in the galactic habitable zone (Ward, Brownlee, and Gonzalez estimate this factor as 0.1<ref name=Gonzalez/>).\n* <math>f_p</math> is the fraction of stars in the [[Milky Way]] with planets.\n* <math>f_{pm}</math> is the fraction of planets that are rocky (\"metallic\") rather than gaseous.\n* <math>f_i</math> is the fraction of habitable planets where microbial life arises. Ward and Brownlee believe this fraction is unlikely to be small.\n* <math>f_c</math> is the fraction of planets where complex life evolves. For 80% of the time since microbial life first appeared on the Earth, there was only bacterial life. Hence Ward and Brownlee argue that this fraction may be small.\n* <math>f_l</math> is the fraction of the total lifespan of a planet during which complex life is present. Complex life cannot endure indefinitely, because the energy put out by the sort of star that allows complex life to emerge gradually rises, and the central star eventually becomes a [[red giant]], engulfing all planets in the planetary habitable zone. Also, given enough time, a catastrophic extinction of all complex life becomes ever more likely.\n* <math>f_m</math> is the fraction of habitable planets with a large moon. If the [[giant impact theory]] of the Moon's origin is correct, this fraction is small.\n* <math>f_j</math> is the fraction of planetary systems with large Jovian planets. This fraction could be large.\n* <math>f_{me}</math> is the fraction of planets with a sufficiently low number of extinction events. Ward and Brownlee argue that the low number of such events the Earth has experienced since the [[Cambrian explosion]] may be unusual, in which case this fraction would be small.\n\nThe Rare Earth equation, unlike the [[Drake equation]], does not factor the probability that complex life evolves into [[intelligence|intelligent life]] that discovers technology. Barrow and Tipler<ref>{{BarrowTipler1986}} Section 3.2</ref> review the consensus among such biologists that the evolutionary path from primitive Cambrian [[chordate]]s, e.g., ''[[Pikaia]]'' to ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', was a highly improbable event. For example, the large [[brain]]s of humans have marked adaptive disadvantages, requiring as they do an expensive [[metabolism]], a long [[gestation period]], and a childhood lasting more than 25% of the average total life span. Other improbable features of humans include:\n*Being one of a handful of extant [[bipedal]] land (non-avian) [[vertebrate]]. Combined with an unusual [[eye\u2013hand coordination]], this permits dextrous manipulations of the physical environment with the [[hand]]s;\n*A [[vocal folds|vocal apparatus]] far more expressive{{citation needed|reason=What about dolphins?

Only recently did humans acquire anything like their current scientific and technological sophistication.\n\n==Advocates==\nWriters who support the Rare Earth hypothesis:\n* [[Stuart Ross Taylor]],<ref name=Taylor98/> a specialist on the Solar System, firmly believes in the hypothesis. Taylor concludes that the Solar System is probably unusual, because it resulted from so many chance factors and events.\n* Stephen Webb,<ref name=\"Webb, Stephen 2002\"/> a physicist, mainly presents and rejects candidate solutions for the [[Fermi paradox]]. The Rare Earth hypothesis emerges as one of the few solutions left standing by the end of the book{{clarifyme|date=April 2020}}\n* [[Simon Conway Morris]], a [[paleontologist]], endorses the Rare Earth hypothesis in chapter 5 of his ''Life's Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe'',<ref>{{harvnb|Conway Morris|2003|loc=Ch. 5}}</ref> and cites Ward and Brownlee's book with approval.<ref>Conway Morris, 2003, p. 344, n. 1</ref>\n* [[John D.

But this hypothesis is not central to their book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'', a thorough study of the [[anthropic principle]] and of how the laws of physics are peculiarly suited to enable the emergence of complexity in nature.\n* [[Ray Kurzweil]], a computer pioneer and self-proclaimed [[Singularitarian]], argues in ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that the coming [[Technological singularity|Singularity]] requires that Earth be the first planet on which sapient, technology-using life evolved. Although other Earth-like planets could exist, Earth must be the most evolutionarily advanced, because otherwise we would have seen evidence that another culture had experienced the [[Technological singularity|Singularity]] and expanded to harness the full computational capacity of the physical universe.\n* [[John Gribbin]], a prolific science writer, defends the hypothesis in ''Alone in the Universe: Why our planet is unique''.<ref>{{harvnb|Gribbin|2011}}</ref>\n* [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]], [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] who supports the concept of [[galactic habitable zone]] uses the hypothesis in his book ''[[The Privileged Planet]]'' to promote the concept of [[intelligent design]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gonzalez |first1=Guillermo |title=Habitable Zones in the Universe |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |date=December 2005 |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=555\u2013606 |doi=10.1007/s11084-005-5010-8 |pmid=16254692 |arxiv=astro-ph/0503298|bibcode=2005OLEB...35..555G }}</ref>\n* [[Michael H.

Some biologists, such as [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], believe this assumption too restrictive and unimaginative; they see it as a form of [[begging the question|circular reasoning]].\n\nAccording to [[David Darling (astronomer)|David Darling]], the Rare Earth hypothesis is neither [[hypothesis]] nor [[prediction]], but merely a description of how life arose on Earth.<ref>{{harvnb|Darling|2001|p=}}</ref> In his view Ward and Brownlee have done nothing more than select the factors that best suit their case.\n{{cquote|What matters is not whether there's anything unusual about the Earth; there's going to be something [[idiosyncratic]] about every planet in space.

Larger secondary bodies would exert proportionally larger tidal forces that would in turn decelerate their primaries faster and potentially increase the solar day of a planet in all other respects like Earth to over 120 hours within a few billion years. This long solar day would make effective heat dissipation for organisms in the tropics and subtropics extremely difficult in a similar manner to tidal locking to a red dwarf star. Short days (high rotation speed) causes high wind speeds at ground level. Long days (slow rotation speed) cause the day and night temperatures to be too extreme.<ref>[http://news.discovery.com/earth/what-would-happen-if-our-planet-became-tidally-locked-130202.htm discovery.com What If Earth Became Tidally Locked? 2 February 2013]</ref>\n\nMany Rare Earth proponents argue that the Earth's plate tectonics would probably not exist if not for the tidal forces of the Moon.<ref>Ward & Brownlee 2000, p. 233</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Nick |first=Hoffman |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/life-01x1.html |title=The Moon And Plate Tectonics: Why We Are Alone |work=Space Daily |date=11 June 2001 |accessdate=8 August 2015}}</ref> The hypothesis that the Moon's tidal influence initiated or sustained Earth's plate tectonics remains unproven, though at least one study implies a temporal correlation to the formation of the Moon.<ref name=\"TurnerRushmer2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=S. |last2=Rushmer |first2=T. |last3=Reagan |first3=M. |last4=Moyen |first4=J.-F. |title=Heading down early on?

Although his strict-metre style is not as polished as some, it has been characterised as \"fluent and natural\".<ref name=stephens436>Stephens, M. ''The new companion to the literature of Wales'', UWP, 1998, p.436</ref> His work ranges from elaborate poems of praise and devotional verse to broad humour, the latter particularly when begging patrons for various items. He was an accomplished scribe, and is thought to have been responsible for compiling much, if not all, of ''Llyfr Gwyn Hergest'' (the [[White Book of Hergest]]), an important late-medieval Welsh manuscript which disappeared in the early 19th century (he also added several poems to the [[Red Book of Hergest]], which is now in the [[National Library of Wales]]). Lewys was also an expert on [[heraldry]], and compiled several treatises on the subject. The manuscript Peniarth 109, which contains over a hundred of his poems in his own hand, was illustrated by him with the arms of many Welsh noble families.\n\nHis entire works were published in 1953 through the cooperation of the [[National Library of Wales]] and the [[University of Wales Press]] Board, and were edited by [[E.

''Welsh poems, sixth century to 1600'', UCP, 1974, p.78</ref>}}\n\nA tradition states that Lewys, who appears to have died around 1490, was buried at [[Abergwili]], but his place of burial and exact date of death remain unconfirmed.<ref name=\"dwb\"/> One of his last poems is addressed to Henry Tudor after the latter had been crowned as King Henry VII.\n\n==Work==\n\nLewys was a prolific poet, writing many celebratory poems and [[elegies]]: about 230 of his poems have survived in various manuscript sources. Although his strict-metre style is not as polished as some, it has been characterised as \"fluent and natural\".<ref name=stephens436>Stephens, M. ''The new companion to the literature of Wales'', UWP, 1998, p.436</ref> His work ranges from elaborate poems of praise and devotional verse to broad humour, the latter particularly when begging patrons for various items. He was an accomplished scribe, and is thought to have been responsible for compiling much, if not all, of ''Llyfr Gwyn Hergest'' (the [[White Book of Hergest]]), an important late-medieval Welsh manuscript which disappeared in the early 19th century (he also added several poems to the [[Red Book of Hergest]], which is now in the [[National Library of Wales]]). Lewys was also an expert on [[heraldry]], and compiled several treatises on the subject. The manuscript Peniarth 109, which contains over a hundred of his poems in his own hand, was illustrated by him with the arms of many Welsh noble families.\n\nHis entire works were published in 1953 through the cooperation of the [[National Library of Wales]] and the [[University of Wales Press]] Board, and were edited by [[E. D. Jones]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/338259/Lewis-Glyn-Cothi] [[Lewis Glyn Cothi]] on [[Britannica.com]]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Poetry}}\n* [http://cy.wikisource.org/wiki/Categori:Lewis_Glyn_Cothi Lewis Glyn Cothi at Wikisource]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1490s deaths]]\n[[Category:Medieval Welsh poets]]\n[[Category:Welsh-language poets]]\n[[Category:15th-century Welsh writers]]\n[[Category:People of the Wars of the Roses]]\n[[Category:People from Carmarthenshire]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:15th-century Welsh poets]]\n", "name_user": "Certes", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLife:Fix placename links, replaced:Mold\u2192Mold", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewys_Glyn_Cothi"}

By the Six-Day War of 1967 AJC had become a passionate defender of the Jewish state, shedding old inhibitions to espouse the centrality of Jewish peoplehood.\n\n=== The 1960s and 1970s ===\nThrough direct dialogue with the [[Catholic Church]], AJC played a leading role in paving the way for a significant upturn in [[Jewish-Christian relations]] in the years leading up to the Roman Catholic Church's 1965 document ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', and in the ensuing years.\n\nBefore the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, AJC was officially \"non-Zionist\". It had long been ambivalent about [[Zionism]] as possibly opening up Jews to the charge of dual loyalty, but it supported the [[creation of Israel]] in 1947-48, after the United States backed the [[partition of Palestine]].

He has the right to express his views no less than those whom he challenges. It is important to stress that he has not suggested that those about whom he writes are anti-Semitic, though that straw-man argument is being invoked by some as a diversionary tactic.
