It was renamed the Jazz Bass as Fender felt that its redesigned neck\u2014narrower and more rounded than that of the Precision Bass\u2014would appeal more to [[jazz]] musicians.\n\nThe Jazz Bass has two [[single coil pickup]]s with two pole pieces per string. As well as having a slightly different, less symmetrical and more contoured body shape (known in Fender advertising as the \"Offset Waist Contour\" body), the Jazz Bass neck is noticeably narrower at the nut than that of the [[Fender Precision Bass]]. While the Precision Bass was originally styled similarly to the [[Fender Telecaster|Telecaster]] guitar, the Jazz Bass' styling was inspired by the [[Fender Jazzmaster|Jazzmaster]] guitar{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}, with which the Jazz shared its offset body and sculpted edges that differentiate it from other slab-style bass bodies.\n\nThe original intention of the instrument was to appeal to upright bass players. The original Jazz Bass had two stacked knob pots with volume and tone control for each pickup. Original instruments with this stacked configuration are highly valued in the vintage guitar market. In late 1961 it received three control knobs:<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://vintagebassworld.com/description.php?manufacturer=Fender&product=Jazz&year=0|title=VINTAGE BASS WORLD |accessdate=2016-12-17}}</ref> two controlling the volume of each pickup and one the overall tone. Despite this new feature, many stacked knob models were made until about 1962. Another feature the initial models had were the \"Spring Felt Mutes\", which were present on basses from 1960 until 1962. The purpose of those mutes was to dampen the overtones and the sustain, and were screwed in place between the bridge and aft pickup. Those felt mutes were not a tremendous success, and were replaced by a cheaper, more simple foam mute glued underneath the bridge cover as was used by the Precision Bass from 1963 onwards. Over the following years as the use of mutes gradually declined both the Precision and Jazz Bass models eventually began to be produced without bridge/tailpiece covers.\n\nA number of cosmetic changes were made to the instrument when CBS purchased the Fender companies in 1965. During 1965/66 the Jazz Bass received bound rosewood [[fingerboard]]s with [[pearloid]] dot position inlays (which replaced the older \"clay\"-style of the early 1960s) and oval-shaped [[tuning machine]]s. Block-shaped fingerboard inlays and an optional maple fingerboard were introduced after 1966/67. At first necks with rosewood fretboards received pearloid blocks/binding and maple fretboard necks received black. Fender switched to pearloid blocks/binding on all necks in mid-to-late 1973. Fender also switched to the three-bolt neck \"micro-tilt adjustable\" neck and the \"bullet\" [[truss rod]] in mid-to-late 1974 before reverting to the more standard four-bolt neck fixing and dot-shaped fretboard markers in 1983. White pickup covers and a pickguard/control plate were introduced the same year. In 1986 Fender introduced the Japanese-made [[Fender Performer Bass]], also with micro-tilt neck, designed by John Page and intended to be an Elite version of the Jazz Bass; however, the radical styling was not popular and production ceased the same year.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nAmerican Standard Jazz Basses produced between 1989 and 1994{{fraction|1|2}} featured a larger body shape, a 'curved' neck plate set into a chambered pocket for greater sustain and a 22-fret neck, similar to that of a [[Fender Precision Bass Plus|Precision Bass Plus]], with a standard vintage-style top-load bridge, two separate volumes and a master TBX tone circuit.\n\nUsually known as \"Boner\" Jazz Basses, these early American Standard models (designed by George Blanda, who was Fender's senior [[R&D]] engineer during that period) were discontinued in 1994 and shouldn't be confused with the Fender Jazz Bass Plus, which has the same 22-fret neck design, but utilizes a different (downsized) body styling, [[Lace Sensor]] pickups, [[Schaller Electronic GmbH|Schaller]] \"Elite\" fine-tuner bridge on the four-string model or Gotoh Hardware high-mass bridge on the 5-string model, and [[Philip Kubicki Factor Bass|Phil Kubicki]]-designed active electronics. Unlike the [[Fender Precision Bass Plus]], which had an optional maple neck, the Boner Jazz Bass was offered only with a rosewood fingerboard.\n\nThe Jazz Plus Bass was available with an alder body and the option of a natural-finish ash body on the four-string model for a $100 upcharge, either a maple or rosewood fretboard on the four-string and pau ferro (an exotic hardwood whose tone is brighter than rosewood yet warmer than ebony) on the five-string. The Jazz Plus debuted in 1989 (the five-string model was released in 1990), discontinued in 1994 and replaced by the [[Fender American Deluxe Series|USA Deluxe Series]] Jazz Bass the following year.\n\n[[File:Weather Report (Jaco Pastorius).jpg|thumb|190px|alt=Jaco Pastorius playing his 1960 Jazz Bass|Jaco Pastorius playing his 1960 Jazz Bass, on November 27, 1977]] A fourth push button control is available on American-made Jazz Basses produced between mid-2003 until 2008. Known as the \"S-1 Switch\", this feature allows the pickups to operate in standard, [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel wiring]], or alternatively in [[Series and parallel circuits|series wiring]] when the switch is depressed. While in series, both pickups function as a single unit with one volume control, giving the Jazz Bass a sound more similar to the Precision Bass.\n\nThe two pickups are built to be opposite from each other in both magnetic polarity and electrical phase, so that when heard together, hum is cancelled\u2014the [[humbucking]] effect. The Highway One Jazz Bass is a moderately priced American-made bass introduced in 2003, featuring a Leo Quan BadAss II bridge with grooved saddles, Posiflex graphite neck support rods, 1970s styling and a Greasebucket tone circuit since 2006.\n\nIn 2008, the American Series models were replaced by a new American Standard line, which greatly differs from the first-generation American Standard Series basses introduced in 1994. The 2008 American Standard Jazz Bass retained the \"American Series\" rolled-edge neck with highly detailed nut and fret work, as well as the familiar rounded body shape with the vintage body radius, but deleted the S-1 switching system and incorporated a new high-mass vintage bridge, Hipshot lightweight vintage-style tuning machines, a richer and deeper neck tint, gloss maple or rosewood fingerboard and satin back for smooth playability. It also has a thinner finish undercoat that lets the body breathe and improves resonance. In March 2012 Fender updated the American Standard Jazz Bass (except the five-string version) with Custom Shop 1960s Jazz Bass pickups.\n\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Jazz Bass, first introduced in 1960, Fender released in 2010 the 50th Anniversary Limited Edition Jazz Bass. This bass sports a selected alder body finished in a Candy Apple Red nitrocellulose lacquer and incorporates design elements from several periods in the instrument's history, including 1960s-era lacquer finish, headstock logo, chrome bridge and pickup covers, 1970s-era thumb rest and bridge pickup positioning, modern-era high-mass bridge and Posiflex graphite neck support rods.\n\n==Design features==\n[[File:Fender Jazz Bass Headstock.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A typical Fender Jazz Bass [[headstock]].]]\nThe Jazz Bass has a bright sound, with more high end than the Precision Bass. This makes it ideal for [[Slapping (music)|slap]] playing as well as finger-style players. This bright sound is due to the fact that there are two pickups at different points in the string's length. The bridge pickup gives a tone with more treble, while the neck pickup will yield a rounder sound. The ability to blend the volume of both pickups allows for a wider variety of tones than the Precision Bass can produce. Pickups are RWRP (reverse wound, reverse polarity) from one another, so all hum will be canceled when both pickups are at full volume.\n\nHaving both pickups cranked up at full volume produces the classic scooped, \"growling\" sound which many players\u2014such as [[Marcus Miller]] and [[Will Lee (bassist)|Will Lee]]\u2014use for slap bass playing. This sound is the product of certain frequencies from both pickups being out of phase and cancelling each other, leaving a \"scoop\" on the midrange. This is similar to what happens on some guitars when you blend the sounds from two different pickups, such as the [[Fender Stratocaster]].\n\nSome \"Deluxe\" Jazz Bass models feature an active pre-amp (usually with three bands of equalization) in place of a single passive tone control; these basses have three separate equalizer controls: bass and treble responses are controlled by the base and top of a stacked double pot, while midrange is controlled by a second knob. They came with 22 frets, abalone dot position inlays and an 18-volt power supply on some models. Known as Jazz Bass Deluxe since introduced as part of a major reworking of Fender's Electric Bass lineup in 1995, they have been renamed the [[Fender American Deluxe Series|American Deluxe Jazz Bass]] to the public as of August 2000 in a ''Bass Player'' magazine review of the new \"''Fender American Deluxe Precision V''\" five-string counterpart model to the American Deluxe Jazz Bass.\n\nThe American Deluxe Jazz Bass (available in four-string fretted and fretless, five-string fretted and left-hand versions) featured two Samarium Cobalt Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups, designed by pickup designer Bill Lawrence. Fender used downsized bodies to accommodate the 22-fret neck and reshaped the pickguard with nine screw holes.\n\nAmerican Deluxes produced between 1995 and 1999 were initially available with \"single-pole\" pickups designed by [[Suhr Guitars|John Suhr]]. These were soon changed to the Bill Turner-designed [[Vintage Noiseless|dual-coil Ceramic Noiseless]] units with nickel-plated (gold-plated on certain models) polepieces until the advent of the [[Bill Lawrence (guitar maker)|Bill Lawrence]]-designed [[Vintage Noiseless|Samarium Cobalt]] series in 2004.\n\nOther refinements include a strings-through-body/top-load bridge, Posiflex graphite neck support rods, rolled fingerboard edges, highly detailed nut and fret work. Five-string versions are presented with a 4+1 tuner arrangement and two Hipshot string trees since 2002. The asymmetrical five-bolt neck plate, along with the smooth contoured heel allow much easier access to the upper registers. Bound fingerboards with pearloid block inlays were added with the introduction of the American Deluxe Jazz Bass FMT & QMT in late 2001, featuring flamed or quilted maple tops and gold-plated hardware. Fender discontinued these models in 2007.\n\nIn 2010 the American Deluxe Jazz Bass has been updated with a pair of N3 stacked-coil Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups, an active/passive toggle switch, CBS styling and a 21-fret bound compound radius maple neck featuring rosewood or maple fingerboards with rectangular block inlays. Other features include Hipshot vintage lightweight tuners, \"Strong Arm\" string retainer bar for the A and low B strings, and Fender's High Mass Vintage (HMV) bridge. The American Deluxe series was discontinued in 2016.\n\nThe American Elite Jazz Bass, introduced in 2016, sports a compound modern C-to-D neck shape, fourth-generation noiseless pickups, a \"spoke-wheel\" truss rod system for easier neck relief adjustments and a new asymmetrical neck heel. It is offered with a compound radius ebony (since 2017) or maple fingerboard, in 4 and 5-string versions.\n\nThe Mexican Deluxe Active Jazz Bass combines many of the features of the American Deluxe models with a traditional Standard Jazz Bass body, vintage-style hardware, a contoured neck heel and a 12\"-radius 20-fret rosewood or maple fingerboard. It comes in 4 and 5-string versions and sports a three-band active circuit powered by two dual-coil ceramic Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups and an 18V power supply with an active/passive switch (as of 2016).\n\nThe Custom Classic model was made at the [[Fender Custom Shop]]. This Custom Shop Jazz Bass was a cross between the American Vintage and the [[Fender American Deluxe Series|American Deluxe series]]. Features include an oversized select alder or premium ash body, a modern 34\"-scale C-shape maple neck with an unbound rosewood, [[pau ferro]] or maple fingerboard featuring triangular pearloid block inlays and 21 medium-jumbo frets. Available in four- and five-string versions, all Custom Classic Jazz Basses came with a pair of custom-wound dual-coil [[Vintage Noiseless|Noiseless]] Jazz Bass pickups, a three-band active preamp, five-bolt neck plate, 18V power supply and a Deluxe string-through-body/top-load bridge with milled nickel-plated brass saddles. Models manufactured prior to 2003 (formerly known as ''American Classics'') were identical to the mid-1990s American Deluxe basses in appearance, excepting the 22-fret bound maple neck featuring a rosewood fretboard and white block inlays. Fender discontinued the five-string version in 2009. The Custom Classic four-string Jazz Bass has been renamed Custom Active Jazz Bass as of 2010, featuring Fender's high-mass vintage (HMV) bridge and a 1960s Jazz Bass \"U\" shape neck.\n\nThe Standard Jazz Bass model is sanded, painted and assembled in Ensenada, Baja California along with the other Standard Series guitars (replaced by the Player models in 2018). In December 5, 2008, the Standard J-Bass has given CBS era-style decals, a three-ply parchment pickguard and a tinted maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard (also available in a [[fretless]] version with a rosewood fingerboard and 20 inlaid white fretline markers). Other features included two staggered bi-pole single-coil pickups and a return to the black bakelite control knobs. Models produced before 2003 came for a period with black Stratocaster control knobs. The five-string version (introduced in 1992), available with pao ferro or rosewood fingerboard and a five-in-line tuner configuration with Gotoh Mini machineheads (c. 2006), has been updated with a tinted maple neck featuring a dark rosewood fingerboard and a 4+1 tuner configuration with Fender/Ping tuning machines as of 2009. In 2017 Fender switched to pao ferro fingerboards before discontinuing the Standard series in 2018. \n\nAll five-string Jazz basses came with [[pau ferro]] fretboard since 1990 (some [[Fender American Deluxe Series|US Deluxe]] models were also available with a plain [[maple]] neck option). [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] offers its 5-string basses with [[rosewood]] or [[maple]] fretboard as of 2006 after discontinuing the [[pau ferro]] fingerboard option in late 2005. In 2008, Fender introduced the fretted and fretless [[Steve Bailey]] signature models, its first six-string Jazz Basses to feature a 9.5\" to 14\" compound-radius [[ebony]] fingerboard.\n\n==Models==\n* Standard Jazz Bass\n* Standard Jazz Bass Fretless\n* Standard [[Jazz Bass V]]\n* American Professional Jazz Bass\n* American Professional Jazz Bass Fretless\n* American Professional Jazz Bass Left-Handed\n* American Professional Jazz Bass V\n* American Elite Jazz Bass\n* American Elite Jazz Bass V\n* Deluxe Active Jazz Bass\n* Deluxe Active Jazz Bass V\n* American Vintage '64 Jazz Bass\n* American Vintage '74 Jazz Bass\n* '60s Jazz Bass\n* '70s Jazz Bass\n* Road Worn '60s Jazz Bass\n* Blacktop Jazz Bass\n* Modern Player Jazz Bass\n* Modern Player Jazz Bass V\n* Player Jazz Bass\n* A line of Fender Squier models\n\n===Discontinued models===\n* American Deluxe Jazz Bass\n* American Deluxe Jazz Bass V\n* American Deluxe Jazz Bass Fretless\n* American Deluxe Jazz Bass Left-Handed\n* American Vintage '62 Jazz Bass\n* American Vintage '64 Jazz Bass\n* American Vintage '75 Jazz Bass\n* American Special Jazz Bass\n* American Jazz Bass Plus\n* American Jazz Bass Plus V\n* Highway One Jazz Bass\n* Jazz Bass 24\n* Jazz Bass 24 V\n* Power Jazz Bass Special \u2013 same specs as the Jazz Bass Special except for the addition of a reversed split P-Bass pickup, active electronics and a 22-fret neck.\n* Jazz Bass Special \u2013 featured black hardware, P/J pickup configuration with 3-way switching, two volume and one TBX tone control (reissued as the [[Duff McKagan]] Precision Bass in 2007).\n* American Standard Jazz Bass\n* American Standard Jazz Bass Fretless\n* American Standard Jazz Bass Left-Handed\n* American Standard Jazz Bass V\n\n==Signature models==\n[[File:FGF museum 10.

It was available in the Fender price list as part of the Deluxe Series line, with Cherry Sunburst (discontinued as of 2007) and Tobacco Sunburst finishes over a quilted maple top and chrome-plated hardware. The 5-string version was introduced in 2007.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 2008, Fender offered both the four- and five-string versions of the 24-fret Jazz Bass in a stealthy Flat Black finish (with matching headstocks and hardware). These two-octave Jazz Basses were gone from the Fender pricelist as of 2009.\n\nFender Jazz Bass 24 were made in [[Korea]].\n\n==Fender Jaguar Bass==\n{{Main|Fender Jaguar Bass}}\nIn 2005, Fender introduced the [[Fender Jaguar Bass]], as of 2008 available in Hot Rod Red, Olympic White, Sunburst and Black finishes, with a three-ply white or tortoise pickguard. This is a variation on the traditional Jazz Bass design\u2014differences being that it has only one master volume and tone, but additional on/off switches for pickup selection, series/parallel switching, and a two-band active preamp with bypass switch.\n\nThe Jaguar bass retains the slim Jazz neck, bi-pole pickups, [[Jazzmaster]]/Jaguar body design and the trademark Jazz Bass growl.\n\nAs of 2008, the Jaguar Bass comes in Olympic White and three-colour Sunburst finishes, together with a four-ply brown tortoise shell pickguard. These colours were previously available only for the Japanese domestic market.\n\nIn 2012, Fender also introduced the Reverse Jaguar Bass in its line of Pawn Shop Series guitars. This special issue features a reversed body stock orientation, and also reverses the humbucking pickups for a unique tone.\n\nFender also offers several models of the Jaguar Bass in the Squier line (and an American Standard version since 2014), most with a Precision/Jazz \"P-J\" pickup configuration.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]]\n* [[Fender Precision Bass]]\n* [[Fender Aerodyne Jazz Bass]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Bacon\n | first = Tony\n | title = 50 Years of Fender: Half a Century of the Greatest Electric Guitars\n | publisher = Backbeat Books\n | location = London\n | year = 2000\n | isbn = 0-87930-621-1\n}}\n\n;Specific\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Literature==\n* Peter Bertges.

In 1986 Fender introduced the Japanese-made [[Fender Performer Bass]], also with micro-tilt neck, designed by John Page and intended to be an Elite version of the Jazz Bass; however, the radical styling was not popular and production ceased the same year.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nAmerican Standard Jazz Basses produced between 1989 and 1994{{fraction|1|2}} featured a larger body shape, a 'curved' neck plate set into a chambered pocket for greater sustain and a 22-fret neck, similar to that of a [[Fender Precision Bass Plus|Precision Bass Plus]], with a standard vintage-style top-load bridge, two separate volumes and a master TBX tone circuit.\n\nUsually known as \"Boner\" Jazz Basses, these early American Standard models (designed by George Blanda, who was Fender's senior [[R&D]] engineer during that period) were discontinued in 1994 and shouldn't be confused with the Fender Jazz Bass Plus, which has the same 22-fret neck design, but utilizes a different (downsized) body styling, [[Lace Sensor]] pickups, [[Schaller Electronic GmbH|Schaller]] \"Elite\" fine-tuner bridge on the four-string model or Gotoh Hardware high-mass bridge on the 5-string model, and [[Philip Kubicki Factor Bass|Phil Kubicki]]-designed active electronics. Unlike the [[Fender Precision Bass Plus]], which had an optional maple neck, the Boner Jazz Bass was offered only with a rosewood fingerboard.\n\nThe Jazz Plus Bass was available with an alder body and the option of a natural-finish ash body on the four-string model for a $100 upcharge, either a maple or rosewood fretboard on the four-string and pau ferro (an exotic hardwood whose tone is brighter than rosewood yet warmer than ebony) on the five-string. The Jazz Plus debuted in 1989 (the five-string model was released in 1990), discontinued in 1994 and replaced by the [[Fender American Deluxe Series|USA Deluxe Series]] Jazz Bass the following year.\n\n[[File:Weather Report (Jaco Pastorius).jpg|thumb|190px|alt=Jaco Pastorius playing his 1960 Jazz Bass|Jaco Pastorius playing his 1960 Jazz Bass, on November 27, 1977]] A fourth push button control is available on American-made Jazz Basses produced between mid-2003 until 2008. Known as the \"S-1 Switch\", this feature allows the pickups to operate in standard, [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel wiring]], or alternatively in [[Series and parallel circuits|series wiring]] when the switch is depressed. While in series, both pickups function as a single unit with one volume control, giving the Jazz Bass a sound more similar to the Precision Bass.\n\nThe two pickups are built to be opposite from each other in both magnetic polarity and electrical phase, so that when heard together, hum is cancelled\u2014the [[humbucking]] effect. The Highway One Jazz Bass is a moderately priced American-made bass introduced in 2003, featuring a Leo Quan BadAss II bridge with grooved saddles, Posiflex graphite neck support rods, 1970s styling and a Greasebucket tone circuit since 2006.\n\nIn 2008, the American Series models were replaced by a new American Standard line, which greatly differs from the first-generation American Standard Series basses introduced in 1994. The 2008 American Standard Jazz Bass retained the \"American Series\" rolled-edge neck with highly detailed nut and fret work, as well as the familiar rounded body shape with the vintage body radius, but deleted the S-1 switching system and incorporated a new high-mass vintage bridge, Hipshot lightweight vintage-style tuning machines, a richer and deeper neck tint, gloss maple or rosewood fingerboard and satin back for smooth playability. It also has a thinner finish undercoat that lets the body breathe and improves resonance. In March 2012 Fender updated the American Standard Jazz Bass (except the five-string version) with Custom Shop 1960s Jazz Bass pickups.\n\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Jazz Bass, first introduced in 1960, Fender released in 2010 the 50th Anniversary Limited Edition Jazz Bass. This bass sports a selected alder body finished in a Candy Apple Red nitrocellulose lacquer and incorporates design elements from several periods in the instrument's history, including 1960s-era lacquer finish, headstock logo, chrome bridge and pickup covers, 1970s-era thumb rest and bridge pickup positioning, modern-era high-mass bridge and Posiflex graphite neck support rods.\n\n==Design features==\n[[File:Fender Jazz Bass Headstock.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A typical Fender Jazz Bass [[headstock]].]]\nThe Jazz Bass has a bright sound, with more high end than the Precision Bass. This makes it ideal for [[Slapping (music)|slap]] playing as well as finger-style players. This bright sound is due to the fact that there are two pickups at different points in the string's length. The bridge pickup gives a tone with more treble, while the neck pickup will yield a rounder sound. The ability to blend the volume of both pickups allows for a wider variety of tones than the Precision Bass can produce. Pickups are RWRP (reverse wound, reverse polarity) from one another, so all hum will be canceled when both pickups are at full volume.\n\nHaving both pickups cranked up at full volume produces the classic scooped, \"growling\" sound which many players\u2014such as [[Marcus Miller]] and [[Will Lee (bassist)|Will Lee]]\u2014use for slap bass playing. This sound is the product of certain frequencies from both pickups being out of phase and cancelling each other, leaving a \"scoop\" on the midrange. This is similar to what happens on some guitars when you blend the sounds from two different pickups, such as the [[Fender Stratocaster]].\n\nSome \"Deluxe\" Jazz Bass models feature an active pre-amp (usually with three bands of equalization) in place of a single passive tone control; these basses have three separate equalizer controls: bass and treble responses are controlled by the base and top of a stacked double pot, while midrange is controlled by a second knob. They came with 22 frets, abalone dot position inlays and an 18-volt power supply on some models. Known as Jazz Bass Deluxe since introduced as part of a major reworking of Fender's Electric Bass lineup in 1995, they have been renamed the [[Fender American Deluxe Series|American Deluxe Jazz Bass]] to the public as of August 2000 in a ''Bass Player'' magazine review of the new \"''Fender American Deluxe Precision V''\" five-string counterpart model to the American Deluxe Jazz Bass.\n\nThe American Deluxe Jazz Bass (available in four-string fretted and fretless, five-string fretted and left-hand versions) featured two Samarium Cobalt Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups, designed by pickup designer Bill Lawrence. Fender used downsized bodies to accommodate the 22-fret neck and reshaped the pickguard with nine screw holes.\n\nAmerican Deluxes produced between 1995 and 1999 were initially available with \"single-pole\" pickups designed by [[Suhr Guitars|John Suhr]]. These were soon changed to the Bill Turner-designed [[Vintage Noiseless|dual-coil Ceramic Noiseless]] units with nickel-plated (gold-plated on certain models) polepieces until the advent of the [[Bill Lawrence (guitar maker)|Bill Lawrence]]-designed [[Vintage Noiseless|Samarium Cobalt]] series in 2004.\n\nOther refinements include a strings-through-body/top-load bridge, Posiflex graphite neck support rods, rolled fingerboard edges, highly detailed nut and fret work. Five-string versions are presented with a 4+1 tuner arrangement and two Hipshot string trees since 2002. The asymmetrical five-bolt neck plate, along with the smooth contoured heel allow much easier access to the upper registers. Bound fingerboards with pearloid block inlays were added with the introduction of the American Deluxe Jazz Bass FMT & QMT in late 2001, featuring flamed or quilted maple tops and gold-plated hardware. Fender discontinued these models in 2007.\n\nIn 2010 the American Deluxe Jazz Bass has been updated with a pair of N3 stacked-coil Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups, an active/passive toggle switch, CBS styling and a 21-fret bound compound radius maple neck featuring rosewood or maple fingerboards with rectangular block inlays. Other features include Hipshot vintage lightweight tuners, \"Strong Arm\" string retainer bar for the A and low B strings, and Fender's High Mass Vintage (HMV) bridge. The American Deluxe series was discontinued in 2016.\n\nThe American Elite Jazz Bass, introduced in 2016, sports a compound modern C-to-D neck shape, fourth-generation noiseless pickups, a \"spoke-wheel\" truss rod system for easier neck relief adjustments and a new asymmetrical neck heel. It is offered with a compound radius ebony (since 2017) or maple fingerboard, in 4 and 5-string versions.\n\nThe Mexican Deluxe Active Jazz Bass combines many of the features of the American Deluxe models with a traditional Standard Jazz Bass body, vintage-style hardware, a contoured neck heel and a 12\"-radius 20-fret rosewood or maple fingerboard. It comes in 4 and 5-string versions and sports a three-band active circuit powered by two dual-coil ceramic Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups and an 18V power supply with an active/passive switch (as of 2016).\n\nThe Custom Classic model was made at the [[Fender Custom Shop]]. This Custom Shop Jazz Bass was a cross between the American Vintage and the [[Fender American Deluxe Series|American Deluxe series]]. Features include an oversized select alder or premium ash body, a modern 34\"-scale C-shape maple neck with an unbound rosewood, [[pau ferro]] or maple fingerboard featuring triangular pearloid block inlays and 21 medium-jumbo frets. Available in four- and five-string versions, all Custom Classic Jazz Basses came with a pair of custom-wound dual-coil [[Vintage Noiseless|Noiseless]] Jazz Bass pickups, a three-band active preamp, five-bolt neck plate, 18V power supply and a Deluxe string-through-body/top-load bridge with milled nickel-plated brass saddles. Models manufactured prior to 2003 (formerly known as ''American Classics'') were identical to the mid-1990s American Deluxe basses in appearance, excepting the 22-fret bound maple neck featuring a rosewood fretboard and white block inlays. Fender discontinued the five-string version in 2009. The Custom Classic four-string Jazz Bass has been renamed Custom Active Jazz Bass as of 2010, featuring Fender's high-mass vintage (HMV) bridge and a 1960s Jazz Bass \"U\" shape neck.\n\nThe Standard Jazz Bass model is sanded, painted and assembled in Ensenada, Baja California along with the other Standard Series guitars (replaced by the Player models in 2018). In December 5, 2008, the Standard J-Bass has given CBS era-style decals, a three-ply parchment pickguard and a tinted maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard (also available in a [[fretless]] version with a rosewood fingerboard and 20 inlaid white fretline markers). Other features included two staggered bi-pole single-coil pickups and a return to the black bakelite control knobs. Models produced before 2003 came for a period with black Stratocaster control knobs. The five-string version (introduced in 1992), available with pao ferro or rosewood fingerboard and a five-in-line tuner configuration with Gotoh Mini machineheads (c. 2006), has been updated with a tinted maple neck featuring a dark rosewood fingerboard and a 4+1 tuner configuration with Fender/Ping tuning machines as of 2009. In 2017 Fender switched to pao ferro fingerboards before discontinuing the Standard series in 2018. \n\nAll five-string Jazz basses came with [[pau ferro]] fretboard since 1990 (some [[Fender American Deluxe Series|US Deluxe]] models were also available with a plain [[maple]] neck option). [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] offers its 5-string basses with [[rosewood]] or [[maple]] fretboard as of 2006 after discontinuing the [[pau ferro]] fingerboard option in late 2005. In 2008, Fender introduced the fretted and fretless [[Steve Bailey]] signature models, its first six-string Jazz Basses to feature a 9.5\" to 14\" compound-radius [[ebony]] fingerboard.\n\n==Models==\n* Standard Jazz Bass\n* Standard Jazz Bass Fretless\n* Standard [[Jazz Bass V]]\n* American Professional Jazz Bass\n* American Professional Jazz Bass Fretless\n* American Professional Jazz Bass Left-Handed\n* American Professional Jazz Bass V\n* American Elite Jazz Bass\n* American Elite Jazz Bass V\n* Deluxe Active Jazz Bass\n* Deluxe Active Jazz Bass V\n* American Vintage '64 Jazz Bass\n* American Vintage '74 Jazz Bass\n* '60s Jazz Bass\n* '70s Jazz Bass\n* Road Worn '60s Jazz Bass\n* Blacktop Jazz Bass\n* Modern Player Jazz Bass\n* Modern Player Jazz Bass V\n* Player Jazz Bass\n* A line of Fender Squier models\n\n===Discontinued models===\n* American Deluxe Jazz Bass\n* American Deluxe Jazz Bass V\n* American Deluxe Jazz Bass Fretless\n* American Deluxe Jazz Bass Left-Handed\n* American Vintage '62 Jazz Bass\n* American Vintage '64 Jazz Bass\n* American Vintage '75 Jazz Bass\n* American Special Jazz Bass\n* American Jazz Bass Plus\n* American Jazz Bass Plus V\n* Highway One Jazz Bass\n* Jazz Bass 24\n* Jazz Bass 24 V\n* Power Jazz Bass Special \u2013 same specs as the Jazz Bass Special except for the addition of a reversed split P-Bass pickup, active electronics and a 22-fret neck.\n* Jazz Bass Special \u2013 featured black hardware, P/J pickup configuration with 3-way switching, two volume and one TBX tone control (reissued as the [[Duff McKagan]] Precision Bass in 2007).\n* American Standard Jazz Bass\n* American Standard Jazz Bass Fretless\n* American Standard Jazz Bass Left-Handed\n* American Standard Jazz Bass V\n\n==Signature models==\n[[File:FGF museum 10.

He made his first appearance in episode 6600 of the soap, broadcast on 9 July 2013. Ross first appears as the carjacker of [[Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]), before being revealed to be the nephew of [[Moira Barton]] ([[Natalie J. Robb]]). The character is initially characterised as a bad boy and a \"nasty piece of work\". The softer side of Ross' personality is explored when he enters a secret relationship with police officer [[Donna Windsor]] ([[Verity Rushworth]]), who has terminal cancer. When Donna dies, Ross bonds with her daughter [[April Windsor]] (Amelia Flanagan).\n\nProducers created a [[whodunit]] storyline in 2015 when [[Charity Dingle]] ([[Emma Atkins]]) becomes pregnant and does not reveal the father. After giving birth to a son, [[Moses Dingle]], Charity reveals that Ross is his father. Ross also embarks on an affair with Charity's daughter [[Debbie Dingle|Debbie]] ([[Charley Webb]]), who at the time was engaged to Ross' older brother - [[Pete Barton|Pete]] ([[Anthony Quinlan]]). The affair climaxes in the show's August stunt at Debbie and Pete's wedding.\n\nRoss and Pete fight after the reveal, where Pete seemingly kills Ross and leaves his body in the woods. Parr confirmed that he had left the soap and a petition to reintroduce the character gained over 5,000 supporters. It was later revealed that the character is alive, with Parr stating that he liked the response to Ross' death. The character later became involved in several of the show's major events, most significantly where Ross is revealed to have shot his enemy [[Robert Sugden]] ([[Ryan Hawley]]) in the [[Major Emmerdale storylines#Who Shot Robert Sugden?|Who Shot Robert Sugden?]] storyline; with Ross having formed a deal with Robert's adopted half-brother [[Andy Sugden|Andy]] ([[Kelvin Fletcher]]) that he would help kill his brother in exchange for Andy killing Pete, though Andy later changed his mind. In 2018, Ross became the subject of an [[acid attack]] in one of the show's most issued storylines and the character's most defying event. Parr researched extensively for the storyline. Parr's decision to leave the show was announced on 23 May 2018 and Ross departed on 2 November 2018, leaving the village to start anew with Robert's former sister-in-law [[Rebecca White (Emmerdale)|Rebecca White]] ([[Emily Head]]) and their son Sebastian. For his portrayal of Ross Barton and through the character's story arc, Parr has received several award nominations - while critics have praised the character.\n\n==Storylines==\nRoss Barton made his first appearance when he hijacks local resident [[Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]), while she is waiting in her car. Laurel manages to escape and Ross takes the car. Laurel later tracks Ross down and tries to attack him with a pair of scissors, but she becomes scared of Ross. [[Cain Dingle]] ([[Jeff Hordley]]) and [[Marlon Dingle]] ([[Mark Charnock]]) rescue Laurel. Ross later comes to Butler's Farm looking for Cain, after he is shot while carrying out a job that Cain had initially intended to undertake himself. Cain's wife, [[Moira Barton|Moira Dingle]] ([[Natalie J. Robb]]) later recognises Ross as her marital nephew and she allows him to stay at the farm.\n\nRoss generally seems to believe he is a ladies' man and his wandering eye irritates various people. Ross has sex with [[Charity Tate|Charity Sharma]] ([[Emma Atkins]]), as she is intent on making estranged husband [[Jai Sharma]] ([[Chris Bisson]]) jealous. He is seen on occasions with a woman called [[List of Emmerdale characters (2014)#Laura Atkinson|Laura Atkinson]] (Farrel Hegarty), and Ross's lodger [[Debbie Dingle]]'s ([[Charley Webb]]) daughter, [[List of Emmerdale characters (2005)#Sarah Sugden|Sarah]] (Sophia Amber Moore), becomes fond of her. Debbie tells Sarah she will probably never see Laura again.\n\nRoss becomes close to [[Donna Windsor]] ([[Verity Rushworth]]), who he enjoys flirting with and teasing. He realises she is a dodgy policewoman and he agrees to help her burgle the house of Gary North, a prolific local criminal. However, Ross overhears Donna saying that she is only luring him into this position so she can arrest him, as she is fully aware of his previous crimes. But Donna convinces Ross that she was only saying it to keep things under wraps and they go ahead with the burglary. Later on Gary North attacks Ross' brother, [[Finn Barton|Finn]] ([[Joe Gill (actor)|Joe Gill]]), and nearly kills him. To keep his family safe, Ross agrees to do a dodgy job for Gary. Everything goes terribly wrong and the outcome of the job leads Donna to throw herself of a building while handcuffed to Gary, leading to their deaths. Ross is left devastated.\n\nRoss and Debbie begin an affair after weeks of flirting, whilst she is engaged to his brother [[Pete Barton|Pete]] ([[Anthony Quinlan]]). They plan to run away a few days before the wedding, however Cain stops them and announces he is the father of Debbie's half-brother, [[Moses Dingle|Moses]]. Debbie panics and breaks up with Ross after Cain adds that Ross made a deal with Charity to keep the paternity of Moses quiet if he broke up Cain and his wife, Moira. Ross tells Finn everything and he manages to get the letter Debbie had addressed to Pete, in which she confesses to the affair and planning to run away with Ross, before Pete can read it. Debbie and Pete still intend to get married.\n\nOn the wedding day, Cain ties Ross up and puts him into the back of a van, which he parks at the edge of a cliff. Ross escapes by jumping into water below and is unconscious for a while. When he wakes up, he goes back to the village to witness Cain and Pete putting a lifeless Debbie into the car as a result of a helicopter crash. He goes to the hospital and asks Pete whether Debbie is alive; Pete does not respond, worrying Ross. Ross goes back upstairs to see Debbie, but Pete sees him again and attacks him. Security guards throw them out of the hospital, but they continue to fight outside. After Ross punches Pete to the ground and goads him, Pete charges at Ross, causing him to hit his head on a stone wall. Pete keeps punching him, but stops when Ross is unresponsive. Instead of finding help for his dying brother, Pete places Ross into the boot of his car and drives to the woods, where he hides him a ditch and covers his body with leaves.\n\nThree weeks later, Pete and James go to the woods to find the body of Ross, but it was nowhere to be seen. The pair return to inform Chas, Cain and Debbie that the body is gone and that they believe he is still alive. Unbeknownst to anybody, Ross is lying in a hospital bed but in a coma. The next day, Ross wakes up from the coma. The hospital thought that he was named Stephen having found a passport given to him by Cain. Ross tries to get out of talking to the police and leaves the hospital, returning home. He finds Pete and they argue about the events with Ross being angry that Pete had told everyone what he had done and not been reported to the police. He collapses when he tries to punch Pete and returns to the hospital where his parents and Finn were reunited with him. Ross shocked everyone when he forgives Pete for his actions but later kidnaps him and ties him to a bridge with the intention of making him look like he committed suicide.\n\nThe Barton family suffered further anguish in 2016 with the death of James, and again in 2017 with the deaths of Finn and Emma. Emma was murdered by Moira Barton, yet Pete and Ross decided not report her.\n\nIn 2018 Ross was a victim of an acid attack at the hands of Simon ordered by Debbie Dingle, however the attack was actually meant for Joe Tate and Debbie never ordered acid. Months later Ross caught Simon and was going to kill him but was stopped by Moira. Simon was later arrested for the attack along with Debbie but Ross forgave her for her part.\n\nRoss left the village in November 2018 to live in Liverpool with Rebecca White and her son Seb.\n\n==Casting==\nThe character and Parr's casting was officially announced on 24 October 2013.<ref name=\"Ross\"/> On joining the show, Michael Parr stated \"I am thrilled to be playing a regular character in ''Emmerdale''. It was always the plan that Laurel's carjacker would be revealed as [[Moira Barton]]'s ([[Natalie J. Robb]]) nephew \u2013 Ross Barton. It has been fun keeping his identity and my role a secret.

He made his first appearance in episode 6600 of the soap, broadcast on 9 July 2013. Ross first appears as the carjacker of [[Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]), before being revealed to be the nephew of [[Moira Barton]] ([[Natalie J. Robb]]). The character is initially characterised as a bad boy and a \"nasty piece of work\". The softer side of Ross' personality is explored when he enters a secret relationship with police officer [[Donna Windsor]] ([[Verity Rushworth]]), who has terminal cancer. When Donna dies, Ross bonds with her daughter [[April Windsor]] (Amelia Flanagan).\n\nProducers created a [[whodunit]] storyline in 2015 when [[Charity Dingle]] ([[Emma Atkins]]) becomes pregnant and does not reveal the father. After giving birth to a son, [[Moses Dingle]], Charity reveals that Ross is his father. Ross also embarks on an affair with Charity's daughter [[Debbie Dingle|Debbie]] ([[Charley Webb]]), who at the time was engaged to Ross' older brother - [[Pete Barton|Pete]] ([[Anthony Quinlan]]). The affair climaxes in the show's August stunt at Debbie and Pete's wedding.\n\nRoss and Pete fight after the reveal, where Pete seemingly kills Ross and leaves his body in the woods. Parr confirmed that he had left the soap and a petition to reintroduce the character gained over 5,000 supporters. It was later revealed that the character is alive, with Parr stating that he liked the response to Ross' death. The character later became involved in several of the show's major events, most significantly where Ross is revealed to have shot his enemy [[Robert Sugden]] ([[Ryan Hawley]]) in the [[Major Emmerdale storylines#Who Shot Robert Sugden?|Who Shot Robert Sugden?]] storyline; with Ross having formed a deal with Robert's adopted half-brother [[Andy Sugden|Andy]] ([[Kelvin Fletcher]]) that he would help kill his brother in exchange for Andy killing Pete, though Andy later changed his mind. In 2018, Ross became the subject of an [[acid attack]] in one of the show's most issued storylines and the character's most defying event. Parr researched extensively for the storyline. Parr's decision to leave the show was announced on 23 May 2018 and Ross departed on 2 November 2018, leaving the village to start anew with Robert's former sister-in-law [[Rebecca White (Emmerdale)|Rebecca White]] ([[Emily Head]]) and their son Sebastian. For his portrayal of Ross Barton and through the character's story arc, Parr has received several award nominations - while critics have praised the character.\n\n==Storylines==\nRoss Barton made his first appearance when he hijacks local resident [[Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]), while she is waiting in her car. Laurel manages to escape and Ross takes the car. Laurel later tracks Ross down and tries to attack him with a pair of scissors, but she becomes scared of Ross. [[Cain Dingle]] ([[Jeff Hordley]]) and [[Marlon Dingle]] ([[Mark Charnock]]) rescue Laurel. Ross later comes to Butler's Farm looking for Cain, after he is shot while carrying out a job that Cain had initially intended to undertake himself. Cain's wife, [[Moira Barton|Moira Dingle]] ([[Natalie J. Robb]]) later recognises Ross as her marital nephew and she allows him to stay at the farm.\n\nRoss generally seems to believe he is a ladies' man and his wandering eye irritates various people. Ross has sex with [[Charity Tate|Charity Sharma]] ([[Emma Atkins]]), as she is intent on making estranged husband [[Jai Sharma]] ([[Chris Bisson]]) jealous. He is seen on occasions with a woman called [[List of Emmerdale characters (2014)#Laura Atkinson|Laura Atkinson]] (Farrel Hegarty), and Ross's lodger [[Debbie Dingle]]'s ([[Charley Webb]]) daughter, [[List of Emmerdale characters (2005)#Sarah Sugden|Sarah]] (Sophia Amber Moore), becomes fond of her. Debbie tells Sarah she will probably never see Laura again.\n\nRoss becomes close to [[Donna Windsor]] ([[Verity Rushworth]]), who he enjoys flirting with and teasing. He realises she is a dodgy policewoman and he agrees to help her burgle the house of Gary North, a prolific local criminal. However, Ross overhears Donna saying that she is only luring him into this position so she can arrest him, as she is fully aware of his previous crimes. But Donna convinces Ross that she was only saying it to keep things under wraps and they go ahead with the burglary. Later on Gary North attacks Ross' brother, [[Finn Barton|Finn]] ([[Joe Gill (actor)|Joe Gill]]), and nearly kills him. To keep his family safe, Ross agrees to do a dodgy job for Gary. Everything goes terribly wrong and the outcome of the job leads Donna to throw herself of a building while handcuffed to Gary, leading to their deaths. Ross is left devastated.\n\nRoss and Debbie begin an affair after weeks of flirting, whilst she is engaged to his brother [[Pete Barton|Pete]] ([[Anthony Quinlan]]). They plan to run away a few days before the wedding, however Cain stops them and announces he is the father of Debbie's half-brother, [[Moses Dingle|Moses]]. Debbie panics and breaks up with Ross after Cain adds that Ross made a deal with Charity to keep the paternity of Moses quiet if he broke up Cain and his wife, Moira. Ross tells Finn everything and he manages to get the letter Debbie had addressed to Pete, in which she confesses to the affair and planning to run away with Ross, before Pete can read it. Debbie and Pete still intend to get married.\n\nOn the wedding day, Cain ties Ross up and puts him into the back of a van, which he parks at the edge of a cliff. Ross escapes by jumping into water below and is unconscious for a while. When he wakes up, he goes back to the village to witness Cain and Pete putting a lifeless Debbie into the car as a result of a helicopter crash. He goes to the hospital and asks Pete whether Debbie is alive; Pete does not respond, worrying Ross. Ross goes back upstairs to see Debbie, but Pete sees him again and attacks him. Security guards throw them out of the hospital, but they continue to fight outside. After Ross punches Pete to the ground and goads him, Pete charges at Ross, causing him to hit his head on a stone wall. Pete keeps punching him, but stops when Ross is unresponsive. Instead of finding help for his dying brother, Pete places Ross into the boot of his car and drives to the woods, where he hides him a ditch and covers his body with leaves.\n\nThree weeks later, Pete and James go to the woods to find the body of Ross, but it was nowhere to be seen. The pair return to inform Chas, Cain and Debbie that the body is gone and that they believe he is still alive. Unbeknownst to anybody, Ross is lying in a hospital bed but in a coma. The next day, Ross wakes up from the coma. The hospital thought that he was named Stephen having found a passport given to him by Cain. Ross tries to get out of talking to the police and leaves the hospital, returning home. He finds Pete and they argue about the events with Ross being angry that Pete had told everyone what he had done and not been reported to the police. He collapses when he tries to punch Pete and returns to the hospital where his parents and Finn were reunited with him. Ross shocked everyone when he forgives Pete for his actions but later kidnaps him and ties him to a bridge with the intention of making him look like he committed suicide.\n\nThe Barton family suffered further anguish in 2016 with the death of James, and again in 2017 with the deaths of Finn and Emma. Emma was murdered by Moira Barton, yet Pete and Ross decided not report her.\n\nIn 2018 Ross was a victim of an acid attack at the hands of Simon ordered by Debbie Dingle, however the attack was actually meant for Joe Tate and Debbie never ordered acid. Months later Ross caught Simon and was going to kill him but was stopped by Moira. Simon was later arrested for the attack along with Debbie but Ross forgave her for her part.\n\nRoss left the village in November 2018 to live in Liverpool with Rebecca White and her son Seb.\n\n==Casting==\nThe character and Parr's casting was officially announced on 24 October 2013.<ref name=\"Ross\"/> On joining the show, Michael Parr stated \"I am thrilled to be playing a regular character in ''Emmerdale''.

He brought along Koch, who he had sponsored the past two seasons, to pilot the No. 11 Chevy. Longtime NASCAR crew chief Chris Rice was hired as the team's general manager and crew chief. Kaulig Racing formed a technical alliance with [[Richard Childress Racing]] for the 2016 season.<ref name=\"NASCAR-Kaulig-RCR-Jan2016\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2016/01/20/kaulig-racing-inc-to-join-nascar-xfinity-series-in-2016/ |title=Kaulig Racing Inc. to join NASCAR XFINITY Series in 2016 |website=NASCAR.com |publisher=NASCAR Digital Media, LLC. |date=January 20, 2016 |accessdate=January 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Catchfence-KochKaulig-Jan2016\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kauligracing.com/news/kaulig-racing-inc-to-join-nascar-xfinity-series-in-2016/ |title=KAULIG RACING\u2122 INC.

For the team's third race Koch was running solidly in the top 15 before mechanical problems regulated him to a 26th-place finish six laps down. At Fontana, Koch finished 12th and on the lead lap, after running in the top 10 for much of the day. The team would later have several top-10 and top-15 runs, enough to get into the new Xfinity Chase, and also made to the 2nd round as well, but was unable to get to the final round, as he missed out by 7 points after finishing a strong 8th after running in or near the Top 5 all day. Blake finished 7th in the points, a Career best for Koch and Kaulig.\nOn January 9, 2018, Kaulig Racing announced that they parted ways with Koch and had signed [[Camping World Truck Series]] driver [[Ryan Truex]] to drive the No. 11. Truex finished 7th in his team's debut.\n\nAfter a mediocre 2018 season with only one top-five finish, the team announced on December 1, 2018, that Truex would be replaced by NASCAR Truck series title contender [[Justin Haley (racing driver)|Justin Haley]], who will compete for Sunoco Rookie of the Year honors in 2019.\n\n====Car No. 11 results====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:75%\"\n|-\n!

For the team's third race Koch was running solidly in the top 15 before mechanical problems regulated him to a 26th-place finish six laps down. At Fontana, Koch finished 12th and on the lead lap, after running in the top 10 for much of the day. The team would later have several top-10 and top-15 runs, enough to get into the new Xfinity Chase, and also made to the 2nd round as well, but was unable to get to the final round, as he missed out by 7 points after finishing a strong 8th after running in or near the Top 5 all day. Blake finished 7th in the points, a Career best for Koch and Kaulig.\nOn January 9, 2018, Kaulig Racing announced that they parted ways with Koch and had signed [[Camping World Truck Series]] driver [[Ryan Truex]] to drive the No. 11. Truex finished 7th in his team's debut.\n\nAfter a mediocre 2018 season with only one top-five finish, the team announced on December 1, 2018, that Truex would be replaced by NASCAR Truck series title contender [[Justin Haley (racing driver)|Justin Haley]], who will compete for Sunoco Rookie of the Year honors in 2019.\n\n====Car No. 11 results====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:75%\"\n|-\n!
