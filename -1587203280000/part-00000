The story weaves back-and-forth with [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s of Eve's past life and the present day.\n\nIn the flashbacks, Eve was a wild girl who gradually changed into a domesticated housewife after marrying Brock, an ordinary man who leads an uneventful life. While Kat explores her blossoming sexuality with her handsome but dim-witted neighbor and schoolmate, Phil, Eve struggles to deal with aging and quenching her youthful wildness. She tries to be sexy when Brock is away, even luring Phil's attention. After Eve disappears, Kat deals with her abandonment without much issue, occasionally releasing her own wild side, seducing the detective investigating her mother's disappearance. The film then jumps forward three years to the spring of 1991. On a break from college, Kat returns home and seems unfazed to learn that her father is in a relationship with a co-worker.\n\nThe detective Kat has been having an affair with informs her that Brock might have killed Eve after catching her cheating. Kat dismisses this theory, just like she did three years ago, but after mentioning the topic to her friends Beth and Mickey they tell her they suggested this same theory to her and she dismissed them as well. Kat suspects Phil of having slept with Eve and confronts him the night before she is to return to college, but Phil angrily rebuffs it and tells her that her father knows where her mother is.\n\nAfter having recurring dreams about her mother being stranded in the snow, Kat begins to unpack Brock's suspiciously locked freezer in their basement, but is stopped when he walks in on her. She questions him about her mother's disappearance, asking if he does in fact know where she is, but he denies having any knowledge of her whereabouts. Believing her father, Kat bids him goodbye and tearfully boards her flight, returning to college. It is revealed that this was the last time Kat sees her father, as he went out to a bar shortly thereafter and drunkenly admitted to murdering Eve. He is soon arrested and later hangs himself with a sheet in his jail cell, also revealing that he moved Eve's body from the freezer the night before Kat unpacked it.\n\nThe film ends with a flashback of Eve's death; she came home from shopping the afternoon of her disappearance to find Brock and Phil in bed together. Phil dashed out of the room and Eve began laughing hysterically at Brock, incredulous. A humiliated Brock repeatedly begged her to stop, but Eve continued laughing until he grabbed her by the throat and choked her to death.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shailene Woodley]] as Katrina \"Kat\" Connors\n** [[Ava Acres]] as 8-year-old Kat\n* [[Eva Green]] as Eve Connors\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as Brock Connors\n* [[Shiloh Fernandez]] as Phil\n* [[Gabourey Sidibe]] as Beth\n* [[Thomas Jane]] as Detective Scieziesciez\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Dr. Thaler\n* [[Dale Dickey]] as Mrs. Hillman\n* [[Mark Indelicato]] as Mickey\n* [[Sheryl Lee]] as May\n* [[Jacob Artist]] as Oliver\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:White Bird 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Shailene Woodley]] and [[Shiloh Fernandez]] in Paris at the film's French premiere.]]\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in the United States in a [[limited release]] on October 24, 2014 in 4 theaters and grossed $6,302 with an average of  $1,576 per theater and ranking #80 at the box office.

{"title_page": "Bible translations into Romanian", "text_new": "[[File:BibliaCantacuzino.JPG|thumb|right|250px|<center>\u0218erban Cantacuzino Bible  (1688)</center>]]\n\nThe first Romanian Bible translation is the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] ''Palia de la Or\u0103\u0219tie'' (Saxopolitan Old Testament) from 1581/1582. The translators were Hungarian Calvinist priests from [[Transylvania]]. The first complete translation to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] was made in 1688 (called \"[[Biblia de la Bucure\u015fti]]\"). The Old Testament was translated by Moldavian-born [[Nicolae Milescu]] in Constantinople. The translator used as his source a [[Septuagint]] published in Frankfurt in 1597. The manuscript was afterwards revised in Moldova and later brought to Bucharest, where it was again subject to revision by a team of Wallachian scholars (among whom were Radu and \u015eerban Greceanu) with the help of [[\u015eerban Cantacuzino]] and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]].\n\nBefore the publication of the Bucharest Bible, other partial translations were published, such as the Slavic-Romanian Gospel (1551), [[Coresi]]'s Gospel (1561), The Bra\u015fov Psalm Book (1570), Palia from Or\u0103\u015ftie (1582), The New Testament of Alba Iulia (1648) and others. In September 1911, the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] printed the Iasi Old Testament with the Nitzulescu New Testament, revised by Professor Garboviceanu and checked by Prof Alexics. This was the official BFBS text before Cornilescu was adopted in 1924, but was more literal. This text was revised by Cornilescu from 1928 and printed by the Bible Society in 1931 but has not been issued since.\n\nTwo main translations are currently used in Romanian. The [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Church uses the Synodal Version, the standard Romanian Orthodox Bible translation, published in 1988<ref>{{cite web|title=Biblia adec\u0103 dumnezeiasca scriptura a vechiului \u015fi noului testament|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/427976664|website=WorldCat|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref> with the blessings of [[Patriarch]] [[Teoctist Ar\u0103pa\u0219u]].

The translators were Hungarian Calvinist priests from [[Transylvania]]. The first complete translation to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] was made in 1688 (called \"[[Biblia de la Bucure\u015fti]]\"). The Old Testament was translated by Moldavian-born [[Nicolae Milescu]] in Constantinople. The translator used as his source a [[Septuagint]] published in Frankfurt in 1597. The manuscript was afterwards revised in Moldova and later brought to Bucharest, where it was again subject to revision by a team of Wallachian scholars (among whom were Radu and \u015eerban Greceanu) with the help of [[\u015eerban Cantacuzino]] and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]].\n\nBefore the publication of the Bucharest Bible, other partial translations were published, such as the Slavic-Romanian Gospel (1551), [[Coresi]]'s Gospel (1561), The Bra\u015fov Psalm Book (1570), Palia from Or\u0103\u015ftie (1582), The New Testament of Alba Iulia (1648) and others. In September 1911, the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] printed the Iasi Old Testament with the Nitzulescu New Testament, revised by Professor Garboviceanu and checked by Prof Alexics. This was the official BFBS text before Cornilescu was adopted in 1924, but was more literal. This text was revised by Cornilescu from 1928 and printed by the Bible Society in 1931 but has not been issued since.\n\nTwo main translations are currently used in Romanian. The [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Church uses the Synodal Version, the standard Romanian Orthodox Bible translation, published in 1988<ref>{{cite web|title=Biblia adec\u0103 dumnezeiasca scriptura a vechiului \u015fi noului testament|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/427976664|website=WorldCat|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref> with the blessings of [[Patriarch]] [[Teoctist Ar\u0103pa\u0219u]].

Today technology is becoming so fast and advanced that making money with Android mobile has become a trend or fashion. There are many ways to earn money online on mobile. But in this post I will tell you only those simple ways that will give you the opportunity to make real mobile income. \n\n<br />\n==Overview==\nWork-at-home schemes have been around for decades, with the classic \"envelope stuffing\" scam originating in the United States during [[the Depression]] in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name=\"scambusters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scambusters.org/work-at-home.html |title=Top 10 Work At Home and Home Based Business Scams |accessdate=8 December 2010 }}</ref> In this scam, the worker is offered entry to a scheme where they can earn $2 for every envelope they fill. After paying a small $2 fee to join the scheme, the victim is sent a [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] template for the self-same work-from-home scheme, and instructed to post these advertisements around their local area&nbsp;&ndash; the victim is simply \"stuffing envelopes\" with flyer templates that perpetuate the scheme.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/> Originally found as printed adverts in [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s, variants of this scam have expanded into more modern media, such as [[television]] and [[radio]] adverts, and forum posts on the [[Internet]].\n\nIn some countries, law enforcement agencies work to fight work-at-home schemes. In 2006, the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] established [[Project False Hopes]], a federal and state law enforcement sweep that targets bogus business opportunity and work at home scams. The crackdown involved more than 100 law enforcement actions by the FTC, the Department of Justice, the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]], and law enforcement agencies in eleven states.<ref name=\"falsehopes\"/>\n\nLegitimate [[home-based business]] and [[telecommuting]] opportunities do exist, and many people do their jobs in the comfort of their own homes, but anyone seeking such an employment opportunity can be scammed by accepting a home employment offer. A 2007 report in the United States suggested that about 97% of work-at-home offers were scams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/TakeControlOfYourLife/story?id=3003833&page=1 |title=Working From Home: Don't Get Scammed |publisher=ABC: Good Morning America |date= 2007-04-03|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> Many legitimate jobs at home require some form of post-high-school education, such as a [[college degree]] or certificate, or [[trade school]], and some experience in the field in an office or other supervised setting. Additionally, many legitimate at-home jobs are not like those in schemes are portrayed to be, as they are often performed at least some of the time in the company's office, require more [[self discipline]] than a traditional job, and have a higher risk of [[firing]].\n\nCommon types of work found in work-at-home schemes include:\n* Stuffing envelopes.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/> The victim sees a flyer advertising a job stuffing envelopes, with \"up to 1,000 envelopes a week that you can stuff... with postage and address already affixed!\", offering a payment of $1\u20132 per envelope. To apply for the job, the victim is required to send a [[self-addressed stamped envelope]] for information and a small processing fee. In return, the victim is sent a template for the flyer they had originally seen; the envelopes they stuff are from other people who answer the flyer, and the payment is the processing fee.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Assembly of items of some type, such as [[crafts]], [[jewellery]] or medical equipment. The worker is required to pay up front for materials and construction kits, and when they attempt to sell the finished products back to the scheme's organiser, they are told that the products \"don't meet our specifications\", leaving the worker with assembled products and no buyer.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Processing medical claims. The worker pays several hundred dollars for medical billing software, but will later discover that most medical clinics process their own bills, outsource their billing to established firms rather than individuals, or have stricter requirements than the purchased software can provide.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* [[Forum spam]]ming. Usually advertised as some variant of \"email processing\", the worker is simply given instructions on spamming online forums, and told they can make money by selling these same instructions online.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Sales of a product or service that is difficult or impossible to sell. This is often done in the form of a [[pyramid scheme]].\n* Talking on a [[phone sex]] hotline.\n\nSome adverts offer legitimate forms of work that really do exist, but exaggerate the salary and understate the effort that will have to be put into the job, or exaggerate the amount of work that will be available. Many such ads do not even specify the type of work that will be performed. Some similar schemes do not advertise work that would be performed at home, but may instead offer occasional, sporadic work away from home for large payments, paired with a lot of free time. Some common offers fitting this description are acting as [[Extra (actor)|extras]], [[mystery shopping]] (which in reality requires hard work, is paid close to minimum wage, and most importantly, does not require an up-front fee to join) and working as a [[nanny]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Police issue warning over horror film extras scam |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/11/police-warning-horror-film-extras-scam|publisher=The Guardian|date=July 11, 2012|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Mystery Shopping in Australia |url=http://www.financeinformer.com.au/mystery-shopper-jobs-in-australia-and-the-companies-to-work-for/#Mystery-Shopping-in-Australia-|publisher=Finance Informer|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Nanny Scams |url=http://jobsearch.about.com/od/jobsearchscams/a/nanny-scams.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Signs of a scam==\nSigns of a work-at-home scam versus a legitimate job may include:\n* Payment of fee is required prior to starting employment.

In many countries, no legitimate employer will require a fee be paid as a condition of starting work (except perhaps a small amount for a [[criminal background check]]).\n* Pay is too good to be true. Though there may be legitimate jobs in existence in which employees are paid to perform the particular task in question, even from home, in reality, they would be paid a wage that is fair for that type of work and level of education, not the $40 per hour or $3000 per week that is typically offered in a work-at-home scheme.\n* Employer will seemingly hire anyone, with no experience necessary and no qualifications. Legitimate work-at-home employers will only be interested in those who have the proper experience, skills, certification, and other qualifying factors, and will give at least some scrutiny to an applicant seeking employment. But the perpetrator of a work-at-home scheme is only interested in the payment required to join.\n* Company is little known, and does not seemingly have a customer base bringing them revenue from which they can pay employees. \n* Company name is similar to, but not exactly the same as a well known, legitimate company.\n* Company does not appear to have a permanent location. Its address, phone number, and website appear to be centered on recruitment of employees, not customers.\n* Company tries to show unnatural benefits of working in a very short period.\n* Company repeatedly tries to make contact until the victim replies.\n* Fake news stories and Web sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-04-2011/scam-alert-fake-news-websites.html|title=Fake News Websites Pitch Get-Rich-Quick Schemes|author=Sid Kirchheimer|date=2011-04-20|publisher=AARP}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nThe consequences of falling for a work-at-home scheme may be as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://how-to-make-money-working-from-home.academehub.com/50-ways-to-work-from-home-with-online-business-or-not/ |title=Work-at-Home Schemes |publisher=Bbb.org |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}</ref>\n* Loss of money: It may be only the initial fee to join, which may be a large or small amount.

In other cases, the employer may obtain the victim's personal information for purposes of [[identity theft]].\n* Loss of legitimate job: Those with a real job may quit in hopes of a better one, only to find they cannot get their original job back after they discover their dream job was only a [[hoax]].\n* Damaged reputation: Those who engage in sales of a faulty or otherwise controversial product may be tarnishing their own name as the salesperson of such a worthless item.\n* Trouble with law: Some victims may actually receive money.

Its name recognized the state governor at the time, [[John Burke (politician)|John Burke]]. However, the vote was challenged in court, and appealed to the state supreme court. That court ruled on June 3, 1910 to uphold the election results, so on July 12, Governor Burke issued a proclamation creating Burke County.

He also recollects experiencing and revolting against caste-based discrimination during this period. His initial schooling was in [[Thirukkuvalai]] and then in 1936 he shifted to a high school in [[Tiruvarur]]. As a teenager he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders including [[Panaganti Ramarayaningar|Panagal Arasar]], [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy (after whom Karunanidhi later named one of his sons). Karunanidhi joined the [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|anti-Hindi protests]] sparked by the provincial government's legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938 organised a group of boys to hold demonstrations travelling around Tiruvarur on a [[cycle rickshaw]]. The law was rescinded in 1939. The taste for activism however stuck and in the ensuing years, after a brief flirtation with [[Communism]], Karunanidhi started following the work and speeches of leaders of [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], [[Self-Respect Movement]] and [[Dravidar Kazhagam]]. He ignored schooling and dropped-out after failing three-times in the final year.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\nKarunanidhi started his first magazine, at age 15, called ''Manava Nesan'' (Friends of Students), which was hand-written and distributed. It was soon followed by the establishment of ''[[Murasoli]]'' (Drum Roll). He expanded into writing plays propagating Dravidian ideology, and at age 20 starting writing and performing in plays for the ''Dravid Nadigar Kazhagam'' (Dravidian Actor's Group) professionally.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nKarunanidhi married three times. His first marriage was to Padmavathi in September 1944, and they had a son [[M. K. Muthu]], who was briefly active in Tamil films and politics. Padmavathi died in 1948 soon after childbirth. In September of that year, Karunanidhi's marriage was [[arranged marriage|arranged]] with Dayalu Ammal, with whom he had three sons, [[M. K. Alagiri]], [[M. K. Stalin]] and M. K. Tamilarasu, and a daughter, M. K. Selvi. Alagiri and Stalin are active in state politics and competed to be their father's political successors, before Stalin prevailed. Tamilarasu is a businessman and film-producer and campaigner for his father and his party; Selvi campaigned for Karunanidhi elections too. With his third wife, Rajathi Ammal, Karunanidhi had a daughter, [[Kanimozhi]], who is seen as his literary heir.<ref name=\"Family\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/aug/07/life-and-family-of-dmk-supremo-kalaignar-m-karunanidhi-1854601.html|title=Life and family of DMK supremo 'Kalaignar' M Karunanidhi|work=[[The New Indian Express]] |date = 7 August 2018}}</ref><ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\n==Screenwriting==\n[[File:Kalaimamani Award.jpg|left|thumb|Karunanidhi awarding Kalaimamani]]\n{{See also|Parasakthi (1952 film)|Tamil cinema and Dravidian politics}}\nKarunanidhi began his career as a screenwriter in the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] film industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caravanmagazine.in/Story.aspx?Storyid=817&StoryStyle=FullStory |title=The Last Lear \u2013 The Long Profile of Karunanidhi in The Caravan |publisher=[[The Caravan (magazine)|The Caravan India]] |accessdate=22 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326130359/http://caravanmagazine.in/Story.aspx?Storyid=817&StoryStyle=FullStory |archivedate=26 March 2012  }}</ref> His first movie as screenwriter was [[Rajakumari (1947 film)|Rajakumari]] produced by Coimbatore-based [[Jupiter Pictures]] directed by [[A.

Ramachandran]] and [[V. N. Janaki]].\n\nAround late 1949, [[T. R. Sundaram]] of [[Modern Theatres]] Studio in Salem engaged Karunanidhi as scriptwriter for the film [[Manthiri Kumari]] starring [[M. G. Ramachandran]] which would become be a blockbuster hit. Later [[T. R. Sundaram]] had Karunanidhi on permanent rolls at Modern Studio.\n\n===Parasakthi===\nHis most notable movie was ''[[Parasakthi (1952 film)|Parasakthi]]'',<ref name=rethink>[[#Guneratne|Guneratne 2003]], p. 216</ref> a turning point in Tamil cinema, as it espoused the ideologies of the Dravidian movement and also introduced two prominent actors of Tamil filmdom, [[Sivaji Ganesan]] and [[S.

S. Rajendran and P. Kannamba known for its crisp dialogues.\n\n===Writing and narration style===\nThrough his wit and oratorical skills he rapidly rose as a popular politician. As his movies and plays with strong social messages became popular, they suffered from increased censorship; two of his plays in the 1950s were banned.<ref name=Hardgrave/> He was famous for writing historical and social (reformist) stories which propagated the socialist and [[rationalism|rationalist]] ideals of the [[Dravidian movement]] to which he belonged. Alongside [[C. N. Annadurai]] he began using [[Tamil cinema]] to propagate his political ideals through his movies.\n\n===Filmography===\nAt the age of 20, Karunanidhi went to work for Jupiter Pictures as a scriptwriter. His first film, ''[[Rajakumaari]]'', gained him much popularity. It was here that his skills as a scriptwriter were honed, which extended to several films.

His contributions cover a wide range: poems, letters, screenplays, novels, biographies, historical novels, stage-plays, dialogues and movie songs. He has written ''Kuraloviam'' for [[Thirukural]], Tholkaappiya Poonga, Poombukar, as well as many poems, essays and books. Apart from literature, Karunanidhi has also contributed to the [[Tamil language]] through art and architecture. Like the Kuraloviyam, in which Kalaignar wrote about Thirukkural, through the construction of [[Valluvar Kottam]] he gave an architectural presence to [[Thiruvalluvar]], in Chennai. At [[Kanyakumari]], Karunanidhi constructed a 133-foot-high statue of Thiruvalluvar in honour of the scholar.\n\n===Books===\nThe books written by Karunanidhi include ''Sanga Thamizh'', ''Thirukkural Urai'', ''[[Ponnar Sankar]]'', ''Romapuri Pandian'', ''[[Thenpandi Singam]]'', ''Vellikizhamai'', ''Nenjukku Needhi'', ''Iniyavai Irubathu'' and ''Kuraloviam''.  His books of prose and poetry number more than 100.\n\n===Stage plays===\nKarunanidhi's stage plays include: ''Manimagudam'', ''Ore Ratham'', ''Palaniappan'', ''Thooku Medai'', ''Kagithapoo'', ''Naane Arivali'', ''Vellikizhamai'', ''Udhayasooriyan'' and ''[[Silappathikaram]]''.\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Entry into politics===\n[[File:2016 Toyota Alphard 2.5 G van (AGH30R; 12-22-2018), South Tangerang.jpg|thumb|right|Karunanidhi's car Toyota Alphard]]\nKarunanidhi entered politics at the age of 14, inspired by a speech by Alagirisamy of the [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], and participated in [[Anti-Hindi agitations]]. He founded an organisation for the local youth of his locality. He circulated a handwritten newspaper called ''Manavar Nesan'' to its members. Later he founded a student organisation called Tamil Nadu Tamil Manavar Mandram, which was the first student wing of the Dravidan Movement. Karunanidhi involved himself and the student community in social work with other members. Here he started a newspaper for its members, which grew into ''[[Murasoli]]'', the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] party's official newspaper.\n\nThe first major protest that aided Karunanidhi in gaining ground in Tamil politics was his involvement in the Kallakudi agitation in [[Kallakudi]]. Original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi and it was changed to Dalmiapuram after a cement mogul who built a cement plant there. DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi. In the protest Karunanidhi and his companions erased the name Dalmiapuram from the railway station and lay down on the tracks blocking the course of trains. Two people died in the protest and Karunanidhi was arrested.<ref name=\"ramaswamy2210\">[[#Ramaswamy|Ramaswamy 1997]], p. 226</ref>\n\n===Rise to power===\nAt the age of 33, Karunanidhi entered the Tamil Nadu assembly by winning the [[Kulithalai]] seat in the 1957 election. He became the DMK treasurer in 1961 and deputy leader of opposition in the state assembly in the year 1962 and when the DMK came to power in 1967, he became the Minister for Public Works.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-45093900|title=M Karunanidhi: The radical wordsmith who shook up Indian politics|last=|first=|date=7 August 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=8 August 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n====Chief Minister====\nWhen Annadurai died in 1969, Karunanidhi became the [[Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu]] and the first leader of DMK, since the leader post was customarily left vacant for [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] during Annadurai time as Annadurai was party general secretary only. He has held various positions in the party and government during his long career in Tamil Nadu political arena.\n\n====70's and Emergency====\nDuring the [[Emergency]], the DMK was the only ruling party across India that opposed the Emergency,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} for which his government was summarily dismissed by [[Indira Gandhi]]'s government and many of his party leaders were arrested and jailed till the Emergency was lifted. Later, the D.M.K teamed up with the [[Janata Party]] post-Emergency, but suffered defeat at the assembly elections under accusations of corruption .\n\nHis one time friend [[M. G. Ramachandran]], who floated his [[AIADMK]] party after being sacked by Karunanidhi from DMK a few years earlier, would come to power in Tamil Nadu. The DMK then suffered multiple electoral defeats against his primary opponent M.G.Ramachandran's AIADMK, until the latter's death in 1987.\n[[File:The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Dr. Kalaignar M.

He also recollects experiencing and revolting against caste-based discrimination during this period. His initial schooling was in [[Thirukkuvalai]] and then in 1936 he shifted to a high school in [[Tiruvarur]]. As a teenager he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders including [[Panaganti Ramarayaningar|Panagal Arasar]], [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy (after whom Karunanidhi later named one of his sons). Karunanidhi joined the [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|anti-Hindi protests]] sparked by the provincial government's legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938 organised a group of boys to hold demonstrations travelling around Tiruvarur on a [[cycle rickshaw]]. The law was rescinded in 1939. The taste for activism however stuck and in the ensuing years, after a brief flirtation with [[Communism]], Karunanidhi started following the work and speeches of leaders of [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], [[Self-Respect Movement]] and [[Dravidar Kazhagam]]. He ignored schooling and dropped-out after failing three-times in the final year.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\nKarunanidhi started his first magazine, at age 15, called ''Manava Nesan'' (Friends of Students), which was hand-written and distributed. It was soon followed by the establishment of ''[[Murasoli]]'' (Drum Roll). He expanded into writing plays propagating Dravidian ideology, and at age 20 starting writing and performing in plays for the ''Dravid Nadigar Kazhagam'' (Dravidian Actor's Group) professionally.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nKarunanidhi married three times. His first marriage was to Padmavathi in September 1944, and they had a son [[M. K. Muthu]], who was briefly active in Tamil films and politics. Padmavathi died in 1948 soon after childbirth. In September of that year, Karunanidhi's marriage was [[arranged marriage|arranged]] with Dayalu Ammal, with whom he had three sons, [[M. K. Alagiri]], [[M. K. Stalin]] and M. K. Tamilarasu, and a daughter, M. K. Selvi. Alagiri and Stalin are active in state politics and competed to be their father's political successors, before Stalin prevailed. Tamilarasu is a businessman and film-producer and campaigner for his father and his party; Selvi campaigned for Karunanidhi elections too.

Karunanidhi involved himself and the student community in social work with other members. Here he started a newspaper for its members, which grew into ''[[Murasoli]]'', the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] party's official newspaper.\n\nThe first major protest that aided Karunanidhi in gaining ground in Tamil politics was his involvement in the Kallakudi agitation in [[Kallakudi]]. Original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi and it was changed to Dalmiapuram after a cement mogul who built a cement plant there. DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi. In the protest Karunanidhi and his companions erased the name Dalmiapuram from the railway station and lay down on the tracks blocking the course of trains.

This kind of respirator is reusable, with the filters being replaced periodically.]]\n\nA '''respirator''' is a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous atmospheres, including [[wikt:fumes|fumes]], [[vapor|vapours]], [[gases]] and [[particulate matter]] such as dusts and airborne [[microorganisms]]. There are two main categories: the ''air-purifying respirator'', in which respirable air is obtained by filtering a contaminated atmosphere, and the ''air-supplied respirator'', in which an alternate supply of breathable air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contaminants.\n\nAir-purifying respirators range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable face masks sometimes referred to as a [[dust mask]] to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges often called a [[gas mask]].\n\n==Physical form==\nAll respirators have some type of facepiece held to the wearer's head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method.  Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes, to accommodate all types of face shapes. The differences in respirator design impact the [[respirator assigned protection factors]], i.e. the resulting degree of protection from which kind of hazard.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThere are three categories of particulate respirators: particulate-filtering facepiece respirators are discarded when they become unsuitable for further use due to considerations of hygiene, excessive resistance, or physical damage; elastomeric respirators are reusable because the facepiece is cleaned and reused, but the filter cartridges are discarded and replaced when they become unsuitable for further use; and [[Powered air-purifying respirator|powered air-purifying respirators]] have a battery-powered blower that moves the airflow through the filters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource1quest1.html|title=Respirator Trusted-Source Information: What are they?|last=|first=|date=2018-01-29|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nRespirators can have half-face forms that cover the bottom half of the face including the nose and mouth, and full-face forms that cover the entire face. Half-face respirators should only be worn in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area. For example, someone who is spray painting could wear a half-face respirator, but someone who works with [[chlorine]] gas would have to wear a full-face respirator.\n\n== Usage==\nA wide range of industries use respirators including healthcare & pharmaceuticals, defense & public safety services (defense, firefighting & law enforcement), oil and gas industries, manufacturing (automotive, chemical, metal fabrication, food and beverage, wood working, paper and pulp), mining, construction, agriculture and forestry, cement production, power generation, shipbuilding and the textile industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/osh/os/osnr0014.txt|title=Respirator use and practices|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Fit testing ===\n{{Main|Respirator fit test}}\nMost types of respirators depend upon forming a good seal between the respirator body and the face of the wearer.

Quantitative fit testing typically uses a specially prepared respirator with an inserted probe. The respirator is donned, and aerosol concentrations inside and outside of the mask are compared and used to determine a numerical fit factor. Typical room atmosphere contains sufficient particulates to perform the test, but aerosol generators can be used to improve the test accuracy.[[File:Protection Factors of filtering facepiece, measured in real time during work.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Workplace protection factor (PF)]] of filtering facepiece, measured in real time with two optical dust meters.

Two common examples of this type of respirator are single-use escape hoods and filter masks. The latter are typically simple, light, single-piece, half-face masks and employ the first three mechanical filter mechanisms in the list below to remove particulates from the air stream.  The most common of these is the disposable white N95 variety. It is discarded after single use or some extended period depending on the contaminant. Filter masks also come in replaceable-cartridge, multiple-use models. Typically one or two cartridges attach securely to a mask which has built into it a corresponding number of valves for inhalation and one for exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) and the [[International Safety Equipment Association]] (ISEA) established the American National Standard for Air-Purifying Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices to define both test criteria and approval methods for fire/smoke escape hoods. ANSI/ISEA Standard 110 provides design guidance to manufacturers of Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices (RPED) in the form of performance requirements and testing procedures.

Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nMechanical filters remove contaminants from air in several ways: ''interception'' when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it; ''impaction'', when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity; by ''diffusion'', where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100&nbsp;nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter, increasing the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the previous two mechanisms; and by using certain resins, waxes, and plastics as coatings on the filter material to attract particles with an [[electrostatic charge]] that holds them on the filter surface.\n\nThere are many different filtration standards that vary by jurisdiction.  In the [[United States]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] defines the categories of particulate filters according to their [[NIOSH air filtration rating]].  The most common of these are the [[N95 mask]], which filters at least 95% of [[airborne particles]] but is not resistant to [[oil]].

There are different units for different environments. The units consist of a powered [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] which forces incoming air through one or more [[filter (air)|filter]]s to the user for breathing. The fan and filters may be carried by the user or they may be remotely mounted and the user breathes the air through tubing.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe filter type must be matched to the contaminants that need to be removed. Some PAPR's are designed to remove fine particulate matter, while others are suitable for working with [[volatile organic compound]]s as those in [[spray paint]]s. These must have their filter elements replaced more often than a particulate filter.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== Atmosphere-supplying ===\nThese respirators do not purify the ambient air, but supply breathing gas from another source.  The three types are the self contained breathing apparatus, which a compressed air cylinder is worn by the wearer; the supplied air respirators, where a hose supplies air from a stationary source; and combination respirators that integrate both types.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/respiratory/respirator_selection_airvsatmos_resp.html|title=Respirator Selection: Air-purifying vs. Atmosphere-supplying Respirators|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n====Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)====\n{{Main|Self-contained breathing apparatus}}\n\nA self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) typically has three main components: a high-pressure air cylinder (e.g., 2200 psi to 4500 psi), a pressure gauge and regulator, and an inhalation connection (mouthpiece, mouth mask or full face mask), connected together and mounted to a carrying frame or a harness with adjustable shoulder straps and belt so it can be worn on the back. There are two kinds of SCBA: open circuit and closed circuit. Most modern SCBAs are open-circuit. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOpen-circuit industrial breathing sets are filled with filtered, compressed air. The compressed air passes through a regulator, is inhaled and exhaled out of the circuit, quickly depleting the supply of air. Air cylinders are made of aluminum, steel, or of a composite construction like fiberglass-wrapped aluminum. The \"positive pressure\" type is common, which supplies a steady stream of air to stop fumes or smoke from leaking into the mask. Other SCBA's are of the \"demand\" type, which only supply air when the regulator senses the user inhaling. All fire departments and those working in toxic environments use the positive pressure SCBA for safety reasons.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe closed-circuit type SCBA filters, supplements, and recirculates exhaled gas like a [[rebreather]]. It is used when a longer-duration supply of breathing gas is needed, such as in mine rescue and in long tunnels, and going through passages too narrow for a large open-circuit air cylinder.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==== Supplied air respirator ====\nSupplied air respirators make use of a hose to deliver air from a stationary source.  It provides clean air for long periods of time and are light weight for the user, although it limits user mobility.  They are normally used when there are extended work periods required in atmospheres that are not immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Regulation ==\nThe choice and use of respirators in developed countries is regulated by national legislation. To ensure that employers choose respirators correctly, and perform high-quality respiratory protection programs, various guides and textbooks have been developed:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"5\" | Textbooks and guidelines for the selection and use of respirators\n|-\n!

This kind of respirator is reusable, with the filters being replaced periodically.]]\n\nA '''respirator''' is a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous atmospheres, including [[wikt:fumes|fumes]], [[vapor|vapours]], [[gases]] and [[particulate matter]] such as dusts and airborne [[microorganisms]]. There are two main categories: the ''air-purifying respirator'', in which respirable air is obtained by filtering a contaminated atmosphere, and the ''air-supplied respirator'', in which an alternate supply of breathable air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contaminants.\n\nAir-purifying respirators range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable face masks sometimes referred to as a [[dust mask]] to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges often called a [[gas mask]].\n\n==Physical form==\nAll respirators have some type of facepiece held to the wearer's head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method.  Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes, to accommodate all types of face shapes. The differences in respirator design impact the [[respirator assigned protection factors]], i.e. the resulting degree of protection from which kind of hazard.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThere are three categories of particulate respirators: particulate-filtering facepiece respirators are discarded when they become unsuitable for further use due to considerations of hygiene, excessive resistance, or physical damage; elastomeric respirators are reusable because the facepiece is cleaned and reused, but the filter cartridges are discarded and replaced when they become unsuitable for further use; and [[Powered air-purifying respirator|powered air-purifying respirators]] have a battery-powered blower that moves the airflow through the filters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource1quest1.html|title=Respirator Trusted-Source Information: What are they?|last=|first=|date=2018-01-29|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nRespirators can have half-face forms that cover the bottom half of the face including the nose and mouth, and full-face forms that cover the entire face. Half-face respirators should only be worn in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area. For example, someone who is spray painting could wear a half-face respirator, but someone who works with [[chlorine]] gas would have to wear a full-face respirator.\n\n== Usage==\nA wide range of industries use respirators including healthcare & pharmaceuticals, defense & public safety services (defense, firefighting & law enforcement), oil and gas industries, manufacturing (automotive, chemical, metal fabrication, food and beverage, wood working, paper and pulp), mining, construction, agriculture and forestry, cement production, power generation, shipbuilding and the textile industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/osh/os/osnr0014.txt|title=Respirator use and practices|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Fit testing ===\n{{Main|Respirator fit test}}\nMost types of respirators depend upon forming a good seal between the respirator body and the face of the wearer.

Quantitative fit testing typically uses a specially prepared respirator with an inserted probe. The respirator is donned, and aerosol concentrations inside and outside of the mask are compared and used to determine a numerical fit factor. Typical room atmosphere contains sufficient particulates to perform the test, but aerosol generators can be used to improve the test accuracy.[[File:Protection Factors of filtering facepiece, measured in real time during work.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Workplace protection factor (PF)]] of filtering facepiece, measured in real time with two optical dust meters.

This includes:\n\n*[[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative-pressure]] respirators using mechanical filters and chemical media\n*[[positive pressure|positive-pressure]] units such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)\n*Escape Only respirators or hoods such as Air-Purifying Escape Respirators for use by the general public for [[chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear]]  (CBRN) terrorism incidents.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFull hood, half- or full-facepiece designs are marketed in many varieties depending on the hazard of concern using an [[air filter]] which acts passively on air inhaled by the wearer. Two common examples of this type of respirator are single-use escape hoods and filter masks. The latter are typically simple, light, single-piece, half-face masks and employ the first three mechanical filter mechanisms in the list below to remove particulates from the air stream.  The most common of these is the disposable white N95 variety. It is discarded after single use or some extended period depending on the contaminant. Filter masks also come in replaceable-cartridge, multiple-use models. Typically one or two cartridges attach securely to a mask which has built into it a corresponding number of valves for inhalation and one for exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) and the [[International Safety Equipment Association]] (ISEA) established the American National Standard for Air-Purifying Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices to define both test criteria and approval methods for fire/smoke escape hoods. ANSI/ISEA Standard 110 provides design guidance to manufacturers of Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices (RPED) in the form of performance requirements and testing procedures. The standard covers certification, ISO registration for the manufacturer, associated test methods, labeling, conditioning requirements, independent process and quality control audits, and follow-up inspection programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://safetyequipment.org/c/std110-2009.cfm |title=International Safety Equipment Association |publisher=Safetyequipment.org |accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> ANSI/ISEA 110 was prepared by members of the ISEA RPED group, in consultation with testing laboratories and was reviewed by a consensus panel representing users, health and safety professionals and government representatives.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission uses ANSI/ISEA 110 as the benchmark in their testing of fire escape masks.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n====Mechanical filter====\n{{Main|Mechanical filter respirator}}\n[[File:Atemluftfilter Einwegmaske.jpg|thumb|Filtering half mask with exhalation valve (class: FFP3)]]\n\n[[File:What it Means to be NIOSH-Approved - A look into N95 Certification Testing.webm|thumb|right|300px|A video describing N95 certification testing]]Mechanical filter respirators retain particulate matter such as dust created during [[woodwork]]ing or metal processing, when contaminated air is passed through the filter material. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nMechanical filters remove contaminants from air in several ways: ''interception'' when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it; ''impaction'', when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity; by ''diffusion'', where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100&nbsp;nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter, increasing the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the previous two mechanisms; and by using certain resins, waxes, and plastics as coatings on the filter material to attract particles with an [[electrostatic charge]] that holds them on the filter surface.\n\nThere are many different filtration standards that vary by jurisdiction.  In the [[United States]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] defines the categories of particulate filters according to their [[NIOSH air filtration rating]].  The most common of these are the [[N95 mask]], which filters at least 95% of [[airborne particles]] but is not resistant to [[oil]].

There are two kinds of SCBA: open circuit and closed circuit. Most modern SCBAs are open-circuit. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOpen-circuit industrial breathing sets are filled with filtered, compressed air. The compressed air passes through a regulator, is inhaled and exhaled out of the circuit, quickly depleting the supply of air. Air cylinders are made of aluminum, steel, or of a composite construction like fiberglass-wrapped aluminum. The \"positive pressure\" type is common, which supplies a steady stream of air to stop fumes or smoke from leaking into the mask. Other SCBA's are of the \"demand\" type, which only supply air when the regulator senses the user inhaling. All fire departments and those working in toxic environments use the positive pressure SCBA for safety reasons.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe closed-circuit type SCBA filters, supplements, and recirculates exhaled gas like a [[rebreather]]. It is used when a longer-duration supply of breathing gas is needed, such as in mine rescue and in long tunnels, and going through passages too narrow for a large open-circuit air cylinder.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==== Supplied air respirator ====\nSupplied air respirators make use of a hose to deliver air from a stationary source.  It provides clean air for long periods of time and are light weight for the user, although it limits user mobility.  They are normally used when there are extended work periods required in atmospheres that are not immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Regulation ==\nThe choice and use of respirators in developed countries is regulated by national legislation.

It was the first time Germany used [[chemical weapon]]s on a large scale releasing 168 tons of [[chlorine gas]] over a four-mile (6&nbsp;km) front killing around 6,000 troops within ten minutes through [[asphyxiation]]. The gas being denser than air flowed downwards forcing troops to climb out of their [[trenches]]. Reserve Canadian troops, who were away from the attack, used [[urine]]-soaked cloths as primitive respirators. A Canadian soldier realized that the [[ammonia]] in urine would react with the chlorine, neutralizing it, and that the water would dissolve the chlorine, allowing soldiers to breathe through the gas.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\nChina normally makes 10 million masks<!-- or [[dust mask]] or [[surgical mask]]--> per day, about half of the world production.

It was designed by [[Percy Allan]] and built in 1897 by E. Taylor of [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]]. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The bridge was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1458>{{cite NSW SHR|5051357|Bridge over Turon River at Wallaby Rocks|hr=01458|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nTimber [[Truss bridge|truss road bridges]] have played a significant role in expanding and improving the New South Wales road network. Before the bridges were built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high-priced wool clip of the time could carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed before the truss bridge's construction.\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited use of iron and steel, which had to be imported from England,<ref name=nswshr-1458/> until the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] opened in the early 20th century.\n\n[[Allan truss]]es were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next 30 years.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nPercy Allan, the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nOpened in October 1897 and built by Messrs. Taylor and Murphy of Balmain, the bridge is maintained by the [[Roads and Maritime Services]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Allan truss bridges|url=http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/documents/projects/key-build-programs/maintenance/timber-truss-road-bridges/timber-tuss-strat-approach-appendix-1c.pdf|publisher=[[Roads and Maritime Services]]|accessdate=19 November 2016|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Wallaby Rocks Bridge is an Allan-type timber [[truss]] road bridge. It has three timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|27.7|m}}. There are two approach spans at one end and one at the other giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|300|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. The timber truss spans are supported by painted twin cast iron cylindrical [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. The approach spans are supported by timber trestles. The bridge provides a single lane carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|15|ft|m|0}}. A post and rail timber guard rail extends the full length of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nThe bridge was reported to be intact and in good condition as at 22 October 1998. The structure is currently carrying more load than it is designed for and, as it is not unique, if it had to be rebuilt it would not be retained. Its design is seen elsewhere as are the iron cylinders supporting it.<ref>{{Cite NSW HD|4300155|Bridge over Turon River at Wallaby Rocks}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nCompleted in 1897, the Wallaby Rocks Bridge is amongst the oldest examples of an Allan-type timber truss road bridge, and in 1998 was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The bridge has iron piers, which is a rare technical and aesthetic feature, and has the ability to demonstrate much about the manufacturing technology of the late 19th century. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Turon River bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nThe Wallaby Rocks Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive, and the large three main span construction is an imposing presence. As such, the bridge has moderate aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Turon River Bridge is held in some esteem by the people of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], and contributes in a small way to the heritage tourism which is popular in the area.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nRare; in 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nRepresentative of Allan truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian roads}}}}\n*[[:Category:Road bridges in New South Wales|List of road bridges in New South Wales]]\n*[[:Category:Allan truss bridges|List of Allan truss bridges]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|last=Allan|first=Percy|author-link=Percy Allan|date=1924|title=Highway Bridge Construction.

The bridge was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1458>{{cite NSW SHR|5051357|Bridge over Turon River at Wallaby Rocks|hr=01458|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nTimber [[Truss bridge|truss road bridges]] have played a significant role in expanding and improving the New South Wales road network. Before the bridges were built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high-priced wool clip of the time could carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed before the truss bridge's construction.\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited use of iron and steel, which had to be imported from England,<ref name=nswshr-1458/> until the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] opened in the early 20th century.\n\n[[Allan truss]]es were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next 30 years.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nPercy Allan, the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nOpened in October 1897 and built by Messrs. Taylor and Murphy of Balmain, the bridge is maintained by the [[Roads and Maritime Services]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Allan truss bridges|url=http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/documents/projects/key-build-programs/maintenance/timber-truss-road-bridges/timber-tuss-strat-approach-appendix-1c.pdf|publisher=[[Roads and Maritime Services]]|accessdate=19 November 2016|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Wallaby Rocks Bridge is an Allan-type timber [[truss]] road bridge. It has three timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|27.7|m}}. There are two approach spans at one end and one at the other giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|300|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. The timber truss spans are supported by painted twin cast iron cylindrical [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. The approach spans are supported by timber trestles. The bridge provides a single lane carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|15|ft|m|0}}. A post and rail timber guard rail extends the full length of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nThe bridge was reported to be intact and in good condition as at 22 October 1998. The structure is currently carrying more load than it is designed for and, as it is not unique, if it had to be rebuilt it would not be retained. Its design is seen elsewhere as are the iron cylinders supporting it.<ref>{{Cite NSW HD|4300155|Bridge over Turon River at Wallaby Rocks}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nCompleted in 1897, the Wallaby Rocks Bridge is amongst the oldest examples of an Allan-type timber truss road bridge, and in 1998 was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The bridge has iron piers, which is a rare technical and aesthetic feature, and has the ability to demonstrate much about the manufacturing technology of the late 19th century. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Turon River bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\nThe Wallaby Rocks Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive, and the large three main span construction is an imposing presence. As such, the bridge has moderate aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Turon River Bridge is held in some esteem by the people of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], and contributes in a small way to the heritage tourism which is popular in the area.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nRare; in 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nRepresentative of Allan truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1458/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian roads}}}}\n*[[:Category:Road bridges in New South Wales|List of road bridges in New South Wales]]\n*[[:Category:Allan truss bridges|List of Allan truss bridges]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|last=Allan|first=Percy|author-link=Percy Allan|date=1924|title=Highway Bridge Construction.

He has an older sister, [[Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway|Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise]]. In accordance with Norway's [[agnatic primogeniture]] succession, Haakon became crown prince when his father ascended the throne on 17 January 1991 upon the death of his grandfather [[Olav V of Norway|Olav V]].\n\nThe [[Skaugum|Skaugum Estate]], situated in the area of [[Semsvannet]], is the official residence of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess.<ref>[http://www.royalcourt.no/artikkel.html?tid=28708&sek=28594 The Royal House of Norway \u2013 Skaugum Estate]</ref>\n\n== Family and early life ==\nHaakon was born in 20 July 1973 at [[Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet|The National Hospital]] in [[St. Hanshaugen]], [[Oslo]], the only son and younger child of [[Harald V of Norway|Crown Prince Harald]] and [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Crown Princess Sonja]]. His father was the son of the reigning Norwegian monarch, [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav V]]. At birth he was named Haakon Magnus, and it was stressed in the announcement that he would go by the name Haakon.{{refn|His godparents are King [[Olav V of Norway]], [[Princess Astrid of Norway]], [[Prince Carl, Duke of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland|Prince Carl Bernadotte]], King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden]], Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}}} He was named in honor of his paternal great-grandfather, [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]], and his maternal uncle Haakon Haraldsen. When Haakon was only 17, his grandfather Olav died on 17 January 1991, leading to the ascension of his father as King Harald V and himself as crown prince.\n\nHaakon has one sibling, [[Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway]] (born 1971). In 1990, the Norwegian constitution was altered, granting [[primogeniture#Absolute primogeniture|absolute primogeniture]] to the Norwegian throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence in the line of succession. This was not, however, done retroactively (as, for example, Sweden had done in 1980), meaning that Haakon continues to take precedence over his older sister. He is also in the [[line of succession to the British throne]], albeit highly removed, as a great-great-grandson of [[Edward VII]].\n\n=== Education and military ===\nHaakon has served in the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]], where he undertook his first-level officer's education at the [[Norwegian Naval Academy]]. This was then followed with a year aboard missile [[torpedo boat]]s and other vessels. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[political science]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1999.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Crown-Prince-Breaks-Tradition-at-Berkeley-2969170.php|title=Crown Prince Breaks Tradition at Berkeley / Norway's royal son has enrolled at Cal|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref> Haakon later attended lectures at the [[University of Oslo]] and took the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' civil servant introductory course in 2001. He completed his education in 2003 at the [[London School of Economics]], where he was awarded an MSc in development studies, specializing in international trade and Africa.\n\nAs of 15 November 2013, in the Royal Norwegian Navy his [[officer rank]] is [[Military ranks and insignia of Norway|Admiral]], and in the [[Norwegian Army]] and the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] his rank is [[General]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/nb/aktuelt/hans-kongelige-hoyhet-kronprinsen-utnevn/id745632/ |title=Hans Kongelige H\u00f8yhet Kronprinsen utnevnes til admiral og general |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=15 November 2013 |website=[[Government.no]] |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Norway)|Ministry of Defence]] |accessdate=14 December 2013 |language=Norwegian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613184317/https://www.regjeringen.no/nb/aktuelt/hans-kongelige-hoyhet-kronprinsen-utnevn/id745632/ |archivedate=13 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== Marriage and children ==\n{{See also|Wedding of Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway, and Mette-Marit Tjessem H\u00f8iby}}\n\nHaakon married a [[commoner]] and single mother [[Mette-Marit Tjessem H\u00f8iby]] on 25 August 2001, at [[Oslo Cathedral]].

Haakon is also the stepfather to Mette-Marit's son Marius Borg H\u00f8iby.\n\n== Activities ==\n[[File:16-11-2015 Presidente em exerc\u00edcio, Michel Temer, recebe no Itamaraty o pr\u00edncipe herdeiro da Noruega, Haakon Magnus (23069823405).jpg|thumb|Haakon with then-Brazilian Vice President [[Michel Temer]] at the [[Itamaraty Palace]] in [[Bras\u00edlia]], Brazil, 16 November 2015.]]\n\nFrom 25 November 2003 to 12 April 2004, Haakon was [[regent]] during the King's treatment for cancer and the subsequent convalescence period. Likewise, Haakon was Regent from 29 March 2005 until the King had fully recovered from the heart surgery he underwent on 1 April. This period ended on 7 June.\n\nIn addition to his official duties, Haakon has a strong interest in cultural matters. He also has given patronage to a number of organisations. In 2006, Haakon established [[Global Dignity]] with [[Pekka Himanen]] and [[John Hope Bryant]]. Global Dignity is an independent, non-political organization that promotes the universal right of every human being to lead a dignified life. Members of the organization include entrepreneurs [[Sir Richard Branson]] and [[Sandro Salsano]].\n\n=== Personal interests ===\nHaakon was involved in several sports and seemed to take a particular liking to [[windsurfing]] and surfing. However, he has not engaged in serious competitions. Haakon is known as a big music fan. When he was younger, he attended music festivals all over Europe, including the [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark and the [[Quart Festival]] in [[Kristiansand]], Norway.\n\nHe has also been part of Olympics ceremonies. In 1994, the Crown Prince and his father played roles during the opening ceremony in [[1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer]]. While the King declared open the Games, the Crown Prince [[List of people who have lit the Olympic Cauldron|lit the cauldron]], paying tribute to his father and grandfather having served as Olympians. He attended the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver.\n\nHe accompanied the band [[Katzenjammer (band)|Katzenjammer]] in their recording of the song \"Vi tenner v\u00e5re lykter\" (for the 2011 [[Christmas]]-themed album of the same name).

Haakon Magnus; born 20 July 1973) is the only son of [[Harald V of Norway|King Harald V]] and [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Queen Sonja]], and [[heir apparent]] to the [[throne of Norway]].\n\nIn 2001, Haakon married [[Mette-Marit Tjessem H\u00f8iby]] with whom he has two children. He has an older sister, [[Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway|Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise]]. In accordance with Norway's [[agnatic primogeniture]] succession, Haakon became crown prince when his father ascended the throne on 17 January 1991 upon the death of his grandfather [[Olav V of Norway|Olav V]].\n\nThe [[Skaugum|Skaugum Estate]], situated in the area of [[Semsvannet]], is the official residence of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess.<ref>[http://www.royalcourt.no/artikkel.html?tid=28708&sek=28594 The Royal House of Norway - Skaugum Estate]</ref>\n\n== Family and early life ==\nHaakon was born in 20 July 1973 at [[Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet|The National Hospital]] in [[St. Hanshaugen]], [[Oslo]], the only son and younger child of [[Harald V of Norway|Crown Prince Harald]] and [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Crown Princess Sonja]]. His father was the son of the reigning Norwegian monarch, [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav V]]. At birth he was named Haakon Magnus, and it was stressed in the announcement that he would go by the name Haakon.{{refn|His godparents are King [[Olav V of Norway]], [[Princess Astrid of Norway]], [[Prince Carl, Duke of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland|Prince Carl Bernadotte]], King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden]], Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}}} He was named in honor of his paternal great-grandfather, [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]], and his maternal uncle Haakon Haraldsen. When Haakon was only 17, his grandfather Olav died on 17 January 1991, leading to the ascension of his father as King Harald V and himself as crown prince.\n\nHaakon has one sibling, [[Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway]] (born 1971). In 1990, the Norwegian constitution was altered, granting [[primogeniture#Absolute primogeniture|absolute primogeniture]] to the Norwegian throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence in the line of succession. This was not, however, done retroactively (as, for example, Sweden had done in 1980), meaning that Haakon continues to take precedence over his older sister. He is also in the [[line of succession to the British throne]], albeit highly removed, as a great-great-grandson of [[Edward VII]].\n\n=== Education and military ===\nHaakon has served in the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]], where he undertook his first-level officer's education at the [[Norwegian Naval Academy]]. This was then followed with a year aboard missile [[torpedo boat]]s and other vessels. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[political science]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1999.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Crown-Prince-Breaks-Tradition-at-Berkeley-2969170.php|title=Crown Prince Breaks Tradition at Berkeley / Norway's royal son has enrolled at Cal|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref> Haakon later attended lectures at the [[University of Oslo]] and took the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' civil servant introductory course in 2001. He completed his education in 2003 at the [[London School of Economics]], where he was awarded an MSc in development studies, specializing in international trade and Africa.\n\nAs of 15 November 2013, in the Royal Norwegian Navy his [[officer rank]] is [[Military ranks and insignia of Norway|Admiral]], and in the [[Norwegian Army]] and the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] his rank is [[General]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/nb/aktuelt/hans-kongelige-hoyhet-kronprinsen-utnevn/id745632/ |title=Hans Kongelige H\u00f8yhet Kronprinsen utnevnes til admiral og general |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=15 November 2013 |website=[[Government.no]] |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Norway)|Ministry of Defence]] |accessdate=14 December 2013 |language=Norwegian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613184317/https://www.regjeringen.no/nb/aktuelt/hans-kongelige-hoyhet-kronprinsen-utnevn/id745632/ |archivedate=13 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== Marriage and children ==\n{{See also|Wedding of Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway, and Mette-Marit Tjessem H\u00f8iby}}\n\nHaakon married a [[commoner]] and single mother [[Mette-Marit Tjessem H\u00f8iby]] on 25 August 2001, at [[Oslo Cathedral]].

Haakon is also the stepfather to Mette-Marit's son Marius Borg H\u00f8iby.\n\n== Activities ==\n[[File:16-11-2015 Presidente em exerc\u00edcio, Michel Temer, recebe no Itamaraty o pr\u00edncipe herdeiro da Noruega, Haakon Magnus (23069823405).jpg|thumb|Haakon with then-Brazilian Vice President [[Michel Temer]] at the [[Itamaraty Palace]] in [[Bras\u00edlia]], Brazil, 16 November 2015.]]\n\nFrom 25 November 2003 to 12 April 2004, Haakon was [[regent]] during the King's treatment for cancer and the subsequent convalescence period. Likewise, Haakon was Regent from 29 March 2005 until the King had fully recovered from the heart surgery he underwent on 1 April. This period ended on 7 June.\n\nIn addition to his official duties, Haakon has a strong interest in cultural matters. He also has given patronage to a number of organisations. In 2006, Haakon established [[Global Dignity]] with [[Pekka Himanen]] and [[John Hope Bryant]]. Global Dignity is an independent, non-political organization that promotes the universal right of every human being to lead a dignified life. Members of the organization include entrepreneurs [[Sir Richard Branson]] and [[Sandro Salsano]].\n\n=== Personal interests ===\nHaakon was involved in several sports and seemed to take a particular liking to [[windsurfing]] and surfing. However, he has not engaged in serious competitions. Haakon is known as a big music fan. When he was younger, he attended music festivals all over Europe, including the [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark and the [[Quart Festival]] in [[Kristiansand]], Norway.\n\nHe has also been part of Olympics ceremonies. In 1994, the Crown Prince and his father played roles during the opening ceremony in [[1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer]]. While the King declared open the Games, the Crown Prince [[List of people who have lit the Olympic Cauldron|lit the cauldron]], paying tribute to his father and grandfather having served as Olympians.
