Fu\u00dfball-Club Kaiserslautern e. V.''', also known as '''1. FCK''', '''FCK''' or '''1. FC Kaiserslautern''' ({{IPA-de|\u0294\u025bf t\u0361se\u02d0 ka\u026a\u032fz\u0250s\u02c8la\u028a\u032ft\u0250n}}), is a [[sports club]] based in [[Kaiserslautern]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. In addition to [[Association Football|football]], the club also operates in several other sports.\n\nOn 2 June 1900, Germania 1896 and FG Kaiserslautern merged to create FC 1900. In 1909, the club went on to join FC Palatia (founded in 1901) and FC Bavaria (founded in 1902) to form FV 1900 Kaiserslautern. In 1929, they merged with SV Ph\u00f6nix to become FV Ph\u00f6nix-Kaiserslautern before finally taking on their current name in 1933.\n\nAs a founding member of the [[Bundesliga]], FCK played from 1963 to 1996 uninterrupted in the top division. It has won four [[List of German football champions|German championships]], two [[DFB-Pokal]]s, and one [[DFL-Supercup]], and historically is among the most successful football clubs in Germany, currently occupying tenth place in the [[All-time Bundesliga table]]. The club's international performances include reaching the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] in 1999 as well as two participations in the UEFA Cup semi-finals. Kaiserslautern won the German championship in the [[1997\u201398 Bundesliga|1997\u201398 season]] as a newly promoted team, which is unique in German football. After a six-year spell in the second tier, in 2018 they were relegated to the [[3. Liga]] for the first time.\n\nSince 1920, Kaiserslautern's stadium has been the [[Fritz-Walter-Stadion]], named after the captain of the West German national team who won the world cup in [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years to World War II===\nTwo of the club's predecessors, Bavaria and FC 1900 Kaiserslautern, were part of the [[Westkreis-Liga]] (I) when this league was formed in 1908, with the latter winning the first league. From 1909 through 1918, the new FV Kaiserslautern performed well, finishing runners-up in 1910 and 1912. The team reached tier-one in the new [[Kreisliga Saar]] in 1919, the [[Kreisliga Pfalz]] in 1920 and the [[Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar]] in 1931 and spent the rest of the 1930s bouncing up and down between the Bezirksliga and the upper level [[Gauliga S\u00fcdwest]], one of sixteen top flight divisions formed in the re-organization of German football under the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Hyll\" >''S\u00fcddeutschlands Fussballgeschichte in Tabellenform 1897\u20131988'', author: Ludolf Hyll</ref>\n\nThe club's performance was unremarkable in the years leading up to [[World War II]], but improved after 1939. They captured the Gauliga S\u00fcdwest/Staffel Saarpfalz title, but lost the overall division title to Staffel Mainhessen winners [[Kickers Offenbach]]. In the 1941\u201342 season the Gauliga S\u00fcdwest was split into the [[Gauliga Hessen-Nassau]] and the [[Gauliga Westmark]], and Kaiserslautern took the Westmark title, going on to play for the first time in the national final rounds. They were decisively put out 3\u20139 by eventual champions [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], the dominant side in this era of German football.<ref name=\"Hyll\" />\n\nThe performance of the team slipped and they finished last in their division in 1944. The following year saw the collapse of league play in this part of Germany as the [[Third Reich]] crumbled under the advance of Allied armies.<ref name=\"Hyll\" />\n\n===Postwar play===\n[[File:Kaiserslautern Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of Kaiserslautern league performance after WWII]]\n\nAfter the war, Southwestern Germany was part of the occupation zone held by the French. Teams there were organized into northern and southern divisions and played to determine which of them would join the new Oberliga being put together. French authorities were slow to loosen their control over play in their zones of occupation&nbsp;\u2013 and in the [[Saarland]] in particular&nbsp;\u2013 Teams in the French areas took longer to join the re-established German national league than in other parts of the country. 1. FC Kaiserslautern resumed play in the [[Oberliga S\u00fcdwest (1945-63)|Oberliga S\u00fcdwest]] in 1945 and finished the season just one point behind [[1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken]]. The next season, they easily won the Gruppe Nord in 1947 due in large part due to the play of [[Fritz Walter (1920\u20132002)|Fritz Walter]] and his brother [[Ottmar Walter|Ottmar]] \u2013 the duo scored 46 goals between them, more than any other entire team.\n\n\n[[File:1FC Kaiserslautern Wappen 2010.svg|right|150px|thumb|Logo 2010\u20132012]]\n\n===Success in the 1950s and entry to the Bundesliga===\nThis marked the beginning of the club's dominance of the Oberliga S\u00fcdwest as they went on to capture the division title eleven times over the next twelve seasons. FCK advanced to Germany's first post-war national final in 1948, but lost 1\u20132 to [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]].\n\nKaiserslautern became a presence on the national scene through the early 1950s, capturing their first German championship in 1951 with a 2\u20131 victory of their own, this time over [[SC Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster|Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster]]. They won a second title in 1953, followed by two losing final appearances in 1954 and 1955. The club also sent five players to the national side for the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]], which [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] won in what became popularly known as \"[[The Miracle of Bern]]\".\n\nKaiserslautern's performance fell off late in the decade and into the early 1960s, highlighted only by an advance to the 1961 [[DFB-Pokal]] final, where they lost 0\u20132 to [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]]. The side recovered its form in time to again win their division on the eve of the formation in 1963 of the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional football league. This secured them one of the 16 places in the new top flight circuit. However, the club's next honours would be some time in coming: they made failed German Cup final appearances in 1972, 1976, and 1981 and were UEFA Cup semi-finalists in [[1981\u201382 UEFA Cup|1982]] (losing narrowly to eventual winners [[IFK G\u00f6teborg]]) before finally winning the domestic Cup in [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1990]]. They followed up the [[1990\u201391 Bundesliga|next season]] with their first Bundesliga championship.\n\n===Fall from the top flight===\n1. FCK won a second German Cup in [[1995\u201396 DFB-Pokal|1996]], but that victory was soured since the team had been relegated to [[2. Bundesliga]] with a 16th-place finish just one week before the Cup final. At the time, Kaiserslautern was one of only four of the original 16 teams that had played in each Bundesliga season since the inception of the league, having never been relegated. This group also included [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] (who went down in the same season), [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]] (down in 1998), and \"the Dinosaur\", [[Hamburger SV]], whose spell ended in 2018.<ref name=hsv>{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/soccer/ct-spt-hamburg-relegated-bundesliga-20180512-story.html |title=Hamburger SV relegated from Bundesliga for first time amid chaotic scenes |date=12 May 2018 |accessdate=12 May 2018 |first=Ciaran |last=Fahey |agency=Associated Press |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Red Devils'' came storming back with an accomplishment unique in Bundesliga history \u2013 and very rare across the major European football leagues \u2013 by winning promotion from the 2. Bundesliga at the first attempt in 1997, and immediately going on to win the national championship under veteran coach [[Otto Rehhagel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/jan/21/joy-of-six-promoted-success-stories |title=The Joy of Six: Newly promoted success stories| author=Scott Murray |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=3 October 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ger/news/newsid=2249508.html |title=How promoted Kaiserslautern won the Bundesliga| author=Steffen Potter |publisher=[[UEFA]] |date=21 May 2015 |accessdate=3 October 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/eedd.html |title=English Energy and Nordic Nonsense| author=Karel Stokkermans|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=3 October 2018 }}</ref> They also played in the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League]], where they topped a group comprising [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and [[Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi|HJK Helsinki]] but were eliminated in the quarter-finals by compatriots [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], who also took back the [[1998\u201399 Bundesliga|domestic title]] (FCK finished 5th).\n\nThe club, however, found itself in serious trouble soon after. Despite coming close to a UEFA Cup final in [[2000\u201301 UEFA Cup|2001]], Kaiserslautern soon found itself on the brink of bankruptcy and at the centre of controversy being played out publicly. The club's management&nbsp;\u2013 [[J\u00fcrgen Friedrich]], Robert Wieschemann and Gerhard Herzog&nbsp;\u2013 were forced out. A new team president, Rene C. J\u00e4ggi, sold the debt-ridden Fritz-Walter-Stadion to an entity owned by the Land [[Rheinland-Pfalz]] and the city of Kaiserslautern, thus saving the club from financial disaster, while a new coach, [[Erik Gerets]], led a run after the winter break that moved the footballers out of last place and saved them from relegation.\n\nThe club started the 2003\u201304 season under the burden of a three-point penalty imposed by the [[German Football Association]] for its financial misdeeds. After a faltering start to the season, Gerets was fired and replaced by [[Kurt Jara]]. Jara was unpopular with the FCK faithful for his defensive football philosophy, but with him at the helm, the club had a safe season. Jara, however, quit the position before the season ended, citing irreconcilable differences with club management.\n\n===2005\u2013present===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nIn 2005, [[Michael Henke]], who served as long-time assistant to Germany's most successful coach [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]], became coach. FCK was initially successful, but then suffered a string of reverses and crashed to the bottom of the table. Henke was fired, and FCK alumnus [[Wolfgang Wolf]] took up the trainer's role. Wolf brought in many young, home-grown players, but despite winning over fans and experts alike, the 2005\u201306 season ended in failure as FCK was once again relegated to the 2. Bundesliga after a nine-year stay at the top flight. They finished the 2006\u201307 season in sixth place in the 2. Bundesliga, seven points out of the promotion places.\n\nOn 20 May 2007, the club announced the Norwegian manager [[Kjetil Rekdal]], formerly with Belgian side [[Lierse SK|Lierse]], as their new head coach. Rekdal took over the reins on 1 July. Due to very bad results (the club being in 16th place in the standings with only three wins in 19 games), Rekdal was sacked and replaced by [[Milan \u0160a\u0161i\u0107]] in February 2008. In April 2008, the club hired [[Stefan Kuntz]] as chairman, and with new leadership at the helm, managed to save themselves from relegation to the new [[3. Liga]] with a win over already promoted 1. FC K\u00f6ln on the final day of the 2007\u201308 season.\n\n[[File:Westkurve aug2010.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Fans celebrating the club's promotion right before the first [[Bundesliga]] home game in four years, which was held against rivals [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].]]\n\n\u0160a\u0161i\u0107 lasted almost the entire [[2008\u201309 2. Bundesliga|2008\u201309 season]] but was dismissed on 4 May 2009 after run of poor results in the second half of the season, and three days after a 1\u20135 defeat by [[F.C. Hansa Rostock|Hansa Rostock]]. Alois Schwartz was named interim coach and he managed the club to a seventh-place finish on the season. The club eventually hired [[Marco Kurz]] as head coach.\n\nUnder Kurz, the club secured promotion to the 1. Bundesliga on 25 April 2010 after four years in the second league. At the start of the [[2010\u201311 Bundesliga|2010\u201311 season]], newly promoted 1. FCK had a promising two-straight wins, including a 2\u20130 victory over the previous year's Bundesliga champions, Bayern Munich. However, after a hard fought 2\u20131 defeat at [[1. FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]] and a 5\u20130 drubbing at eventual season champions, [[Borussia Dortmund]], the club began to struggle and fell back to just ahead of the relegation zone. The club then had a poor start to the second half of the season&nbsp;\u2013 dropping into the relegation zone for several weeks&nbsp;\u2013 but managed to coalesce and eventually earned seven victories in their last ten matches, recording only two defeats and a single draw. They ended this run with four straight victories to finish the season at the seventh place.\n\nThe following season, [[2011\u201312 Bundesliga|2011\u201312]], the club finished in the bottom 18th place and after only two seasons in the top flight, were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga. They remained in that division until [[2017\u201318 2. Bundesliga|2018]], being relegated to the [[3. Bundesliga|third tier]] for the first time in club history.\n\n==Reserve team==\n{{main|1. FC Kaiserslautern II}}\nThe club's reserve team, [[1. FC Kaiserslautern II]], played as 1. FC Kaiserslautern Amateure until 2005. It made a first appearance in the tier three [[Amateurliga S\u00fcdwest]] in 1957. It won a league championship in 1960 and 1968 but was not entitled to promotion to professional level. In 1978, when the [[Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar|Oberliga S\u00fcdwest]] was introduced the team qualified for this new league which it would belong to, with the exception of the 1982\u201383 season, until 1992. It won promotion back to the Oberliga in 1994 and became a yo-yo team between this league and the [[Regionalliga]] above, a league newly introduced in 1994. The team was relegated from the latter in 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2007 but each time won promotion back to the league. Since 2012, it has belonged to the [[Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest]].\n\nThe team has also won the [[South West Cup]] on three occasions, in 1979, 1997 and 2008. Through this competition, 1. FC Kaiserslautern II qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal on those three occasions, reaching the second round twice and being drawn against their own first team in 1997\u201398 where they lost 0\u20135.\n\n==Recent seasons==\n{{updated|18 May 2019|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=320005|title=Bundesliga Archive|work=[[German Football Association|DFB]]|date=September 2010|accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref>}}\n\n{|width=\"750\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Width = 50 |Season\n!width = 40 |Division\n!width = 40 |Rank\n!width = 25 | P\n!width = 25 | W\n!width = 25 | D\n!width = 25 | L\n!width = 25 | GF\n!width = 25 | GA\n!width = 30 | GD\n!width = 30 | Pts\n!width = 80 | [[DFB-Pokal]]\n!width = 50 | [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]\n!width = 50 | [[UEFA Cup]]/[[Europa League]]\n!width = 50 | [[UEFA Champions League]]\n|-\n|[[1989\u201390 Bundesliga|1989\u201390]] || ''Bundesliga'' || 12 || 34 || 10 || 11 || 13 || 42 || 55 || \u221213 || 31:37 || bgcolor=gold | {{sort|1|Winner}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}}\n|-\n|[[1990\u201391 Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] || ''Bundesliga'' || bgcolor=gold | 1 || 34 || 19 || 10 || 5 || 72 || 45 || +27 || 48:20 || {{sort|6|2R}} || {{sort|8|1R}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}}\n|-\n|[[1991\u201392 Bundesliga|1991\u201392]] || ''Bundesliga'' || 5 || 34 || 17 || 10 || 11 || 58 || 42 || +16 || 44:24 || {{sort|4|QF}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|7|\u2014}} || {{sort|9|2R}}\n|-\n|[[1992\u201393 Bundesliga|1992\u201393]] || ''Bundesliga'' || 8 || 34 || 13 || 9 || 12 || 50 || 40 || +10 || 35:33 || {{sort|6|2R}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|6|3R}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}}\n|-\n|[[1993\u201394 Bundesliga|1993\u201394]] || ''Bundesliga'' || 2 || 34 || 18 || 7 || 9 || 64 || 36 || +28 || 43:25 || {{sort|4|QF}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}}\n|-\n|[[1994\u201395 Bundesliga|1994\u201395]] || ''Bundesliga'' || 4 || 34 || 17 || 12 || 5 || 58 || 41 || +17 || 46:22 || {{sort|3|SF}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|7|2R}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}}\n|-\n|[[1995\u201396 Bundesliga|1995\u201396]] || ''Bundesliga'' || bgcolor=red|16 || 34 || 6 || 18 || 10 || 31 || 37 || \u22126 || 36 || bgcolor=gold | {{sort|1|Winner}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|7|2R}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}}\n|-\n|[[1996\u201397 2.

The stadium and the adjacent street are named for the player who brought the club to prominence after the war. The facility is built on the Betzenberg, literally \"Mount Betze\", a steep sandstone hill.\n\nThe stadium has a capacity of 49,780 and was a [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] venue, hosting four preliminary round and one group of 16-round matches. The facility underwent a major refurbishment for the tournament with addition of new grandstands and a roof.\n\n==Club culture==\n[[File:Westkurve april2011.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The \"Westkurve\" in April 2011]]\n\nKaiserslautern's Fritz-Walter-Stadion has long been a feared away venue given the rabid ferocity of Kaiserslautern fans: the most faithful of these supporters are located in the stadium's \"Westkurve\" (Westside, literally \"West Curve\", since the stands used to be shaped in a semicircle behind the goals). Most famously, Bayern Munich once lost a match here in a charged atmosphere by a score of 7\u20134 after leading 4\u20131 at the 58th minute.\n\nThe club has friendly ties to [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]], [[VfB Stuttgart]], [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] and [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock FC]] of Scotland and are bitter rivals of [[Waldhof Mannheim]] and Bayern Munich. They also have lesser local rivalries with [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and, more recently, with [[1.

Fu\u00dfball-Club Kaiserslautern e. V.''', also known as '''1. FCK''', '''FCK''' or '''1. FC Kaiserslautern''' ({{IPA-de|\u0294\u025bf t\u0361se\u02d0 ka\u026a\u032fz\u0250s\u02c8la\u028a\u032ft\u0250n}}), is a [[sports club]] based in [[Kaiserslautern]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. In addition to [[Association Football|football]], the club also operates in several other sports.\n\nOn 2 June 1900, Germania 1896 and FG Kaiserslautern merged to create FC 1900. In 1909, the club went on to join FC Palatia (founded in 1901) and FC Bavaria (founded in 1902) to form FV 1900 Kaiserslautern. In 1929, they merged with SV Ph\u00f6nix to become FV Ph\u00f6nix-Kaiserslautern before finally taking on their current name in 1933.\n\nAs a founding member of the [[Bundesliga]], FCK played from 1963 to 1996 uninterrupted in the top division. It has won four [[List of German football champions|German championships]], two [[DFB-Pokal]]s, and one [[DFL-Supercup]], and historically is among the most successful football clubs in Germany, currently occupying tenth place in the [[All-time Bundesliga table]]. The club's international performances include reaching the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] in 1999 as well as two participations in the UEFA Cup semi-finals. Kaiserslautern won the German championship in the [[1997\u201398 Bundesliga|1997\u201398 season]] as a newly promoted team, which is unique in German football. After a six-year spell in the second tier, in 2018 they were relegated to the [[3. Liga]] for the first time.\n\nSince 1920, Kaiserslautern's stadium has been the [[Fritz-Walter-Stadion]], named after the captain of the West German national team who won the world cup in [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years to World War II===\nTwo of the club's predecessors, Bavaria and FC 1900 Kaiserslautern, were part of the [[Westkreis-Liga]] (I) when this league was formed in 1908, with the latter winning the first league. From 1909 through 1918, the new FV Kaiserslautern performed well, finishing runners-up in 1910 and 1912. The team reached tier-one in the new [[Kreisliga Saar]] in 1919, the [[Kreisliga Pfalz]] in 1920 and the [[Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar]] in 1931 and spent the rest of the 1930s bouncing up and down between the Bezirksliga and the upper level [[Gauliga S\u00fcdwest]], one of sixteen top flight divisions formed in the re-organization of German football under the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Hyll\" >''S\u00fcddeutschlands Fussballgeschichte in Tabellenform 1897\u20131988'', author: Ludolf Hyll</ref>\n\nThe club's performance was unremarkable in the years leading up to [[World War II]], but improved after 1939. They captured the Gauliga S\u00fcdwest/Staffel Saarpfalz title, but lost the overall division title to Staffel Mainhessen winners [[Kickers Offenbach]]. In the 1941\u201342 season the Gauliga S\u00fcdwest was split into the [[Gauliga Hessen-Nassau]] and the [[Gauliga Westmark]], and Kaiserslautern took the Westmark title, going on to play for the first time in the national final rounds. They were decisively put out 3\u20139 by eventual champions [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], the dominant side in this era of German football.<ref name=\"Hyll\" />\n\nThe performance of the team slipped and they finished last in their division in 1944. The following year saw the collapse of league play in this part of Germany as the [[Third Reich]] crumbled under the advance of Allied armies.<ref name=\"Hyll\" />\n\n===Postwar play===\n[[File:Kaiserslautern Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of Kaiserslautern league performance after WWII]]\n\nAfter the war, Southwestern Germany was part of the occupation zone held by the French. Teams there were organized into northern and southern divisions and played to determine which of them would join the new Oberliga being put together. French authorities were slow to loosen their control over play in their zones of occupation&nbsp;\u2013 and in the [[Saarland]] in particular&nbsp;\u2013 Teams in the French areas took longer to join the re-established German national league than in other parts of the country. 1. FC Kaiserslautern resumed play in the [[Oberliga S\u00fcdwest (1945-63)|Oberliga S\u00fcdwest]] in 1945 and finished the season just one point behind [[1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken]]. The next season, they easily won the Gruppe Nord in 1947 due in large part due to the play of [[Fritz Walter (1920\u20132002)|Fritz Walter]] and his brother [[Ottmar Walter|Ottmar]] \u2013 the duo scored 46 goals between them, more than any other entire team.\n\n\n[[File:1FC Kaiserslautern Wappen 2010.svg|right|150px|thumb|Logo 2010\u20132012]]\n\n===Success in the 1950s and entry to the Bundesliga===\nThis marked the beginning of the club's dominance of the Oberliga S\u00fcdwest as they went on to capture the division title eleven times over the next twelve seasons. FCK advanced to Germany's first post-war national final in 1948, but lost 1\u20132 to [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]].\n\nKaiserslautern became a presence on the national scene through the early 1950s, capturing their first German championship in 1951 with a 2\u20131 victory of their own, this time over [[SC Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster|Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster]]. They won a second title in 1953, followed by two losing final appearances in 1954 and 1955. The club also sent five players to the national side for the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]], which [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] won in what became popularly known as \"[[The Miracle of Bern]]\".\n\nKaiserslautern's performance fell off late in the decade and into the early 1960s, highlighted only by an advance to the 1961 [[DFB-Pokal]] final, where they lost 0\u20132 to [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]]. The side recovered its form in time to again win their division on the eve of the formation in 1963 of the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional football league. This secured them one of the 16 places in the new top flight circuit. However, the club's next honours would be some time in coming: they made failed German Cup final appearances in 1972, 1976, and 1981 and were UEFA Cup semi-finalists in [[1981\u201382 UEFA Cup|1982]] (losing narrowly to eventual winners [[IFK G\u00f6teborg]]) before finally winning the domestic Cup in [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1990]]. They followed up the [[1990\u201391 Bundesliga|next season]] with their first Bundesliga championship.\n\n===Fall from the top flight===\n1. FCK won a second German Cup in [[1995\u201396 DFB-Pokal|1996]], but that victory was soured since the team had been relegated to [[2. Bundesliga]] with a 16th-place finish just one week before the Cup final. At the time, Kaiserslautern was one of only four of the original 16 teams that had played in each Bundesliga season since the inception of the league, having never been relegated. This group also included [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] (who went down in the same season), [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]] (down in 1998), and \"the Dinosaur\", [[Hamburger SV]], whose spell ended in 2018.<ref name=hsv>{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/soccer/ct-spt-hamburg-relegated-bundesliga-20180512-story.html |title=Hamburger SV relegated from Bundesliga for first time amid chaotic scenes |date=12 May 2018 |accessdate=12 May 2018 |first=Ciaran |last=Fahey |agency=Associated Press |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Red Devils'' came storming back with an accomplishment unique in Bundesliga history \u2013 and very rare across the major European football leagues \u2013 by winning promotion from the 2. Bundesliga at the first attempt in 1997, and immediately going on to win the national championship under veteran coach [[Otto Rehhagel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/jan/21/joy-of-six-promoted-success-stories |title=The Joy of Six: Newly promoted success stories| author=Scott Murray |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=3 October 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ger/news/newsid=2249508.html |title=How promoted Kaiserslautern won the Bundesliga| author=Steffen Potter |publisher=[[UEFA]] |date=21 May 2015 |accessdate=3 October 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/eedd.html |title=English Energy and Nordic Nonsense| author=Karel Stokkermans|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=3 October 2018 }}</ref> They also played in the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League]], where they topped a group comprising [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and [[Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi|HJK Helsinki]] but were eliminated in the quarter-finals by compatriots [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], who also took back the [[1998\u201399 Bundesliga|domestic title]] (FCK finished 5th).\n\nThe club, however, found itself in serious trouble soon after. Despite coming close to a UEFA Cup final in [[2000\u201301 UEFA Cup|2001]], Kaiserslautern soon found itself on the brink of bankruptcy and at the centre of controversy being played out publicly. The club's management&nbsp;\u2013 [[J\u00fcrgen Friedrich]], Robert Wieschemann and Gerhard Herzog&nbsp;\u2013 were forced out. A new team president, Rene C. J\u00e4ggi, sold the debt-ridden Fritz-Walter-Stadion to an entity owned by the Land [[Rheinland-Pfalz]] and the city of Kaiserslautern, thus saving the club from financial disaster, while a new coach, [[Erik Gerets]], led a run after the winter break that moved the footballers out of last place and saved them from relegation.\n\nThe club started the 2003\u201304 season under the burden of a three-point penalty imposed by the [[German Football Association]] for its financial misdeeds. After a faltering start to the season, Gerets was fired and replaced by [[Kurt Jara]]. Jara was unpopular with the FCK faithful for his defensive football philosophy, but with him at the helm, the club had a safe season. Jara, however, quit the position before the season ended, citing irreconcilable differences with club management.\n\n===2005\u2013present===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nIn 2005, [[Michael Henke]], who served as long-time assistant to Germany's most successful coach [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]], became coach. FCK was initially successful, but then suffered a string of reverses and crashed to the bottom of the table. Henke was fired, and FCK alumnus [[Wolfgang Wolf]] took up the trainer's role. Wolf brought in many young, home-grown players, but despite winning over fans and experts alike, the 2005\u201306 season ended in failure as FCK was once again relegated to the 2. Bundesliga after a nine-year stay at the top flight. They finished the 2006\u201307 season in sixth place in the 2. Bundesliga, seven points out of the promotion places.\n\nOn 20 May 2007, the club announced the Norwegian manager [[Kjetil Rekdal]], formerly with Belgian side [[Lierse SK|Lierse]], as their new head coach. Rekdal took over the reins on 1 July. Due to very bad results (the club being in 16th place in the standings with only three wins in 19 games), Rekdal was sacked and replaced by [[Milan \u0160a\u0161i\u0107]] in February 2008. In April 2008, the club hired [[Stefan Kuntz]] as chairman, and with new leadership at the helm, managed to save themselves from relegation to the new [[3. Liga]] with a win over already promoted 1. FC K\u00f6ln on the final day of the 2007\u201308 season.\n\n[[File:Westkurve aug2010.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Fans celebrating the club's promotion right before the first [[Bundesliga]] home game in four years, which was held against rivals [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].]]\n\n\u0160a\u0161i\u0107 lasted almost the entire [[2008\u201309 2. Bundesliga|2008\u201309 season]] but was dismissed on 4 May 2009 after run of poor results in the second half of the season, and three days after a 1\u20135 defeat by [[F.C. Hansa Rostock|Hansa Rostock]]. Alois Schwartz was named interim coach and he managed the club to a seventh-place finish on the season. The club eventually hired [[Marco Kurz]] as head coach.\n\nUnder Kurz, the club secured promotion to the 1. Bundesliga on 25 April 2010 after four years in the second league. At the start of the [[2010\u201311 Bundesliga|2010\u201311 season]], newly promoted 1. FCK had a promising two-straight wins, including a 2\u20130 victory over the previous year's Bundesliga champions, Bayern Munich. However, after a hard fought 2\u20131 defeat at [[1. FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]] and a 5\u20130 drubbing at eventual season champions, [[Borussia Dortmund]], the club began to struggle and fell back to just ahead of the relegation zone. The club then had a poor start to the second half of the season&nbsp;\u2013 dropping into the relegation zone for several weeks&nbsp;\u2013 but managed to coalesce and eventually earned seven victories in their last ten matches, recording only two defeats and a single draw. They ended this run with four straight victories to finish the season at the seventh place.\n\nThe following season, [[2011\u201312 Bundesliga|2011\u201312]], the club finished in the bottom 18th place and after only two seasons in the top flight, were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga. They remained in that division until [[2017\u201318 2. Bundesliga|2018]], being relegated to the [[3. Bundesliga|third tier]] for the first time in club history.\n\n==Reserve team==\n{{main|1. FC Kaiserslautern II}}\nThe club's reserve team, [[1. FC Kaiserslautern II]], played as 1. FC Kaiserslautern Amateure until 2005. It made a first appearance in the tier three [[Amateurliga S\u00fcdwest]] in 1957. It won a league championship in 1960 and 1968 but was not entitled to promotion to professional level. In 1978, when the [[Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar|Oberliga S\u00fcdwest]] was introduced the team qualified for this new league which it would belong to, with the exception of the 1982\u201383 season, until 1992. It won promotion back to the Oberliga in 1994 and became a yo-yo team between this league and the [[Regionalliga]] above, a league newly introduced in 1994. The team was relegated from the latter in 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2007 but each time won promotion back to the league. Since 2012, it has belonged to the [[Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest]].\n\nThe team has also won the [[South West Cup]] on three occasions, in 1979, 1997 and 2008. Through this competition, 1. FC Kaiserslautern II qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal on those three occasions, reaching the second round twice and being drawn against their own first team in 1997\u201398 where they lost 0\u20135.\n\n==Recent seasons==\n{{updated|18 May 2019|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=320005|title=Bundesliga Archive|work=[[German Football Association|DFB]]|date=September 2010|accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref>}}\n\n{|width=\"750\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Width = 50 |Season\n!width = 40 |Division\n!width = 40 |Rank\n!width = 25 | P\n!width = 25 | W\n!width = 25 | D\n!width = 25 | L\n!width = 25 | GF\n!width = 25 | GA\n!width = 30 | GD\n!width = 30 | Pts\n!width = 80 | [[DFB-Pokal]]\n!width = 50 | [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]\n!width = 50 | [[UEFA Cup]]/[[Europa League]]\n!width = 50 | [[UEFA Champions League]]\n|-\n|[[1989\u201390 Bundesliga|1989\u201390]] || ''Bundesliga'' || 12 || 34 || 10 || 11 || 13 || 42 || 55 || \u221213 || 31:37 || bgcolor=gold | {{sort|1|Winner}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}}\n|-\n|[[1990\u201391 Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] || ''Bundesliga'' || bgcolor=gold | 1 || 34 || 19 || 10 || 5 || 72 || 45 || +27 || 48:20 || {{sort|6|2R}} || {{sort|8|1R}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}}\n|-\n|[[1991\u201392 Bundesliga|1991\u201392]] || ''Bundesliga'' || 5 || 34 || 17 || 10 || 11 || 58 || 42 || +16 || 44:24 || {{sort|4|QF}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|7|\u2014}} || {{sort|9|2R}}\n|-\n|[[1992\u201393 Bundesliga|1992\u201393]] || ''Bundesliga'' || 8 || 34 || 13 || 9 || 12 || 50 || 40 || +10 || 35:33 || {{sort|6|2R}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|6|3R}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}}\n|-\n|[[1993\u201394 Bundesliga|1993\u201394]] || ''Bundesliga'' || 2 || 34 || 18 || 7 || 9 || 64 || 36 || +28 || 43:25 || {{sort|4|QF}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}}\n|-\n|[[1994\u201395 Bundesliga|1994\u201395]] || ''Bundesliga'' || 4 || 34 || 17 || 12 || 5 || 58 || 41 || +17 || 46:22 || {{sort|3|SF}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|7|2R}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}}\n|-\n|[[1995\u201396 Bundesliga|1995\u201396]] || ''Bundesliga'' || bgcolor=red|16 || 34 || 6 || 18 || 10 || 31 || 37 || \u22126 || 36 || bgcolor=gold | {{sort|1|Winner}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}} || {{sort|7|2R}} || {{sort|9|\u2014}}\n|-\n|[[1996\u201397 2.

The stadium and the adjacent street are named for the player who brought the club to prominence after the war. The facility is built on the Betzenberg, literally \"Mount Betze\", a steep sandstone hill.\n\nThe stadium has a capacity of 49,780 and was a [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] venue, hosting four preliminary round and one group of 16-round matches. The facility underwent a major refurbishment for the tournament with addition of new grandstands and a roof.\n\n==Club culture==\n[[File:Westkurve april2011.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The \"Westkurve\" in April 2011]]\n\nKaiserslautern's Fritz-Walter-Stadion has long been a feared away venue given the rabid ferocity of Kaiserslautern fans: the most faithful of these supporters are located in the stadium's \"Westkurve\" (Westside, literally \"West Curve\", since the stands used to be shaped in a semicircle behind the goals). Most famously, Bayern Munich once lost a match here in a charged atmosphere by a score of 7\u20134 after leading 4\u20131 at the 58th minute.\n\nThe club has friendly ties to [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]], [[VfB Stuttgart]], [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] and [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock FC]] of Scotland and are bitter rivals of [[Waldhof Mannheim]] and Bayern Munich. They also have lesser local rivalries with [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and, more recently, with [[1.

Kagawa wrote, spoke, and worked at length on ways to employ Christian principles in the ordering of society and in [[cooperative]]s. His vocation to help the poor led him to live among them. He advocated for [[women's suffrage]] and promoted a peaceful foreign policy.\n\n==Early life==\nKagawa was born in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]] to a philandering businessman and a [[concubine]]. Both parents died while he was young. He was sent away to school, where he learned from two American missionary teachers, Drs. Harry W. Myers and Charles A. Logan, who took him into their homes.\n\nKagawa learned [[English language|English]] from these missionaries and converted to  [[Christianity]] after taking a Bible class in his youth, which led to his being disowned by his remaining extended family. Kagawa studied at Tokyo Presbyterian College, and later enrolled in Kobe Theological Seminary. While studying there, Kagawa was troubled by the seminarians' concern for technicalities of [[doctrine]]. He believed that Christianity in action was the truth behind Christian doctrines.

Spectravideo also released an MSX-DOS disk in conjunction with the SVI-707 which could be loaded into an MSX system. Once MSX-DOS has been loaded, the system searches the MSX-DOS disk for the COMMAND.COM file and loads it into memory.<ref>SVI MSX User Manual (M-246) 1985 (Spectravideo MSX DOS Disk Operating System) Getting Started section 2.1</ref> It not only added floppy disk support commands to [[MSX BASIC]], but also a [[booting]] system, with which it was possible to boot a real disk operating system. In that case, the BDOS bypassed the BASIC ROMs, so that the whole 64&nbsp;KB of address space of the Z80 microprocessor inside the MSX computer could be used for the DOS or for other boot-able disks, for example disk based games. At the same time, the original BIOS ROMs could still be accessed through a \"memory [[Bank switching|bank switch]]\" mechanism, so that DOS-based software could still use BIOS calls to control the hardware and other software mechanisms the main ROMs supplied. Also, due to the BDOS ROM, basic file access capabilities were available even without a command interpreter by using extended BASIC commands.\n\nAt initial startup, COMMAND.COM looks for an optional [[batch file]] named [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] and, if it exists, executes the commands specified in there.<ref name=\"ASCII_1987_MSX2-THB\"/> If MSX-DOS is not invoked and [[Disk BASIC]] starts, a BASIC program named \"AUTOEXEC.BAS\" will be carried out instead, if present.<ref name=\"ASCII_1987_MSX2-THB\"/>\n\nOne major difference between MSX-DOS and MS-DOS 2.x was that MSX-DOS did not use the \"boot sector\" on the floppy to boot, but instead booted using the BDOS ROM routines,{{citation needed|date=January 2012|reason=Didn't it provide means to actually boot off floppy as well? See Boot Sector section in [[Design of the FAT file system#Boot Sector]] article.}} and, in a fashion much like MS-DOS 1.25, it used the [[FAT ID]] value from the first byte of the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] to select [[file system]] parameter profiles for its [[FAT12]] file system instead of from the [[FAT BPB|BIOS Parameter Block]] (BPB) in the boot sector. Also, because there could be more than one floppy disk controller in two or more cartridge slots, MSX-DOS could boot from several different floppy disk drives. This meant that it was possible to have both, a 5\u00bc\" floppy disk drive and a 3\u00bd\" disk drive, and the user could boot from either one of them depending on which drive had a bootable floppy in it.\n\n===Commands===\nThe following is a list of internal [[command (computing)|commands]] supported by MSX-DOS.<ref>[https://ia800707.us.archive.org/22/items/MSXTechnicalDataBook/MSX%20Technical%20Data%20Book.pdf MSX Technical Data Book]</ref>\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=6em}}\n* [[BASIC]]\n* [[COPY (command)|COPY]]\n* [[DATE (command)|DATE]]\n* [[DEL (command)|DEL]]\n* [[DEL (command)|DELETE]]\n* [[DIR (command)|DIR]]\n* [[DEL (command)|ERASE]]\n* [[FORMAT (command)|FORMAT]]\n* [[List of DOS commands#MODE|MODE]]\n* [[List of DOS commands#PAUSE|PAUSE]]\n* [[Comment (computer programming)|REM]]\n* [[REN (command)|REN]]\n* [[REN (command)|RENAME]]\n* [[TIME (command)|TIME]]\n* [[TYPE (DOS command)|TYPE]]\n* [[List of DOS commands#VERIFY|VERIFY]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Development history==\nOn 10 August 1983, [[Paul Allen]] called [[Tim Paterson]], original author of [[86-DOS]] and MS-DOS 1.x, asking him to do a \"[[Z80]] version of MS-DOS\" for the MSX standard.<ref name=\"InfoWorld_Paterson_MSX-DOS\">{{cite web|first=Scott|last=Mace|authorlink=Scott Mace|title=''Floppy Disk-Drive for PCjr to provide 256K of additional RAM'' - Infoworld Magazine p.15 vol.6 Issue 8, Framingham, MA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iC4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15 \n|date=1984-04-30|accessdate=2015-05-16|publisher=Wernerkai}}</ref> At the time, Paterson was busy trying to get the first product of his startup [[Falcon Systems]]<!-- Falcon Systems or Falcon Technology? --> ready to go, so he suggested a few other developers, but Allen said he had already asked. Allen was in a hurry to get it done and nobody else could meet his timeline. Allen and Paterson finally agreed, and on 17 August, they signed an agreement to do \"Z80 MS-DOS 1.25\" for US$100,000 and the rights for Paterson's company to distribute [[MS-DOS 2.0]], [[MS-DOS 2.5|2.5]], and [[MS-DOS 3.0|3.0]] with a hardware product without royalty.<ref name=\"Paterson_2014_MSX-DOS\">{{cite web|first=Tim|last=Paterson|authorlink=Tim Paterson|title=The History of MSX-DOS|url=http://www.msx.org/wiki/The_History_of_MSX-DOS|date=2014-02-17|accessdate=2014-05-31|publisher=Jorito, Maggoo, John Hassink, MSX Resource Center}}</ref>\n\nFor Paterson, this was mostly a translation process. He had already written a Z80-to-8086 assembly language translation program ([[TRANS.COM]]). In this case, he was manually translating in the other direction. Because MS-DOS 1.x was modelled after CP/M's [[application program interface|API]] and was able to run CP/M applications that had been source-level translated to 8086, that would mean, MSX-DOS would be able to run CP/M programs directly.<ref name=\"Paterson_2014_MSX-DOS\"/>\n\nFor this project, Paterson also wrote a Z80 emulator that ran under MS-DOS, which would allow him to do the entire development project under MS-DOS. The MSX-DOS he was writing had an [[I/O System (MS-DOS)|I/O System]] layer, that interfaced directly to the I/O System layer of the MS-DOS machine, that was running the emulation.  This gave MSX-DOS direct access and control of the disk format. Most of the core code was file management, so this was necessary to test it out.<ref name=\"Paterson_2014_MSX-DOS\"/>\n\nBy 2 October 1983, he had [[Microsoft BASIC]] and [[Microsoft M80]] [[macro assembler]] running under MSX-DOS. He finished coding [[COMMAND.COM]] a few days later. He worked out some bugs and demonstrated MSX-DOS to Paul Allen on 11 October. The beta test version was officially delivered on 26 October 1983. It included an [[easter egg (software)|easter egg]], that printed Paterson's name.  The name was encoded with FAT code, so it could not be found by simply searching the file. After delivery of the beta version, the code was sent to [[ASCII (company)|ASCII]] in Japan. They created the I/O System for the MSX machine. That code was developed by [[Jay Suzuki]]. He figured out the easter egg and added his name to it.<ref name=\"Paterson_2014_MSX-DOS\"/>\n \nASCII was having problems getting MSX-DOS working on the actual MSX machine. They had not provided an actual MSX machine to Paterson, and instead flew him to Tokyo on 28 January 1984 to help them. It turned out that ASCII had been modifying the code without telling Paterson, so they were not working from the same code base. Paterson spent three days in Tokyo figuring out the problems and came back to Seattle.<ref name=\"Paterson_2014_MSX-DOS\"/>\n \nChris Larson from Microsoft and Jay Suzuki visited Paterson in Seattle at the end of February and early March 1984. They brought an MSX machine with an [[in-circuit emulator]] (ICE) for debugging. They got everything working and on 23 April 1984, Microsoft accepted delivery and made the final payment for MSX-DOS to Paterson.<ref name=\"Paterson_2014_MSX-DOS\"/>\n\nAt the time MSX-DOS was written, there was only one popular disk operating system for 8-bit [[Intel 8080]] compatible microprocessors, which was [[Digital Research]]'s CP/M-80 system. It was also often used with [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] systems, because the Z80 used an extended 8080 architecture. Microsoft's own disk operating system was also inspired by CP/M.\n\nTo be able to run (slightly modified) CP/M software Microsoft decided to implement functionality similar to major parts of the CP/M BIOS, routines that CP/M systems used to do specific disk operating tasks, such as opening files, etc. Instead of basing the command processor on CP/M's [[CCP (CP/M)|CCP]], which was known for some user unfriendliness, a [[command line interpreter]] ([[COMMAND.COM]]) inspired on its MS-DOS counterpart was used.  Microsoft also chose its own [[FAT12]] file system over CP/M's filing methods. This ensured that MSX-DOS floppies could be used on an MS-DOS machine, and that only one single formatting and filing system would be used. This was an important decision, because CP/M disk were often not interchangeable between machines, incompatible disk formatting schemes being a factor in this.\n\nMicrosoft also added a standard set of disk commands to MSX-DOS, that were compatible with MS-DOS, but not with CP/M. Finally they converted their [[Pipeline (software)|pipelining]] system from MS-DOS to MSX-DOS.

Spectravideo also released an MSX-DOS disk in conjunction with the SVI-707 which could be loaded into an MSX system. Once MSX-DOS has been loaded, the system searches the MSX-DOS disk for the COMMAND.COM file and loads it into memory.<ref>SVI MSX User Manual (M-246) 1985 (Spectravideo MSX DOS Disk Operating System) Getting Started section 2.1</ref> It not only added floppy disk support commands to [[MSX BASIC]], but also a [[booting]] system, with which it was possible to boot a real disk operating system. In that case, the BDOS bypassed the BASIC ROMs, so that the whole 64&nbsp;KB of address space of the Z80 microprocessor inside the MSX computer could be used for the DOS or for other boot-able disks, for example disk based games. At the same time, the original BIOS ROMs could still be accessed through a \"memory [[Bank switching|bank switch]]\" mechanism, so that DOS-based software could still use BIOS calls to control the hardware and other software mechanisms the main ROMs supplied. Also, due to the BDOS ROM, basic file access capabilities were available even without a command interpreter by using extended BASIC commands.\n\nAt initial startup, COMMAND.COM looks for an optional [[batch file]] named [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] and, if it exists, executes the commands specified in there.<ref name=\"ASCII_1987_MSX2-THB\"/> If MSX-DOS is not invoked and [[Disk BASIC]] starts, a BASIC program named \"AUTOEXEC.BAS\" will be carried out instead, if present.<ref name=\"ASCII_1987_MSX2-THB\"/>\n\nOne major difference between MSX-DOS and MS-DOS 2.x was that MSX-DOS did not use the \"boot sector\" on the floppy to boot, but instead booted using the BDOS ROM routines,{{citation needed|date=January 2012|reason=Didn't it provide means to actually boot off floppy as well? See Boot Sector section in [[Design of the FAT file system#Boot Sector]] article.}} and, in a fashion much like MS-DOS 1.25, it used the [[FAT ID]] value from the first byte of the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] to select [[file system]] parameter profiles for its [[FAT12]] file system instead of from the [[FAT BPB|BIOS Parameter Block]] (BPB) in the boot sector. Also, because there could be more than one floppy disk controller in two or more cartridge slots, MSX-DOS could boot from several different floppy disk drives. This meant that it was possible to have both, a 5\u00bc\" floppy disk drive and a 3\u00bd\" disk drive, and the user could boot from either one of them depending on which drive had a bootable floppy in it.\n\n===Commands===\nThe following is a list of internal [[command (computing)|commands]] supported by MSX-DOS.<ref>[https://ia800707.us.archive.org/22/items/MSXTechnicalDataBook/MSX%20Technical%20Data%20Book.pdf MSX Technical Data Book]</ref>\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=6em}}\n* [[BASIC]]\n* [[COPY (command)|COPY]]\n* [[DATE (command)|DATE]]\n* [[DEL (command)|DEL]]\n* [[DEL (command)|DELETE]]\n* [[DIR (command)|DIR]]\n* [[DEL (command)|ERASE]]\n* [[FORMAT (command)|FORMAT]]\n* [[List of DOS commands#MODE|MODE]]\n* [[List of DOS commands#PAUSE|PAUSE]]\n* [[Comment (computer programming)|REM]]\n* [[REN (command)|REN]]\n* [[REN (command)|RENAME]]\n* [[TIME (command)|TIME]]\n* [[TYPE (DOS command)|TYPE]]\n* [[List of DOS commands#VERIFY|VERIFY]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Development history==\nOn 10 August 1983, [[Paul Allen]] called [[Tim Paterson]], original author of [[86-DOS]] and MS-DOS 1.x, asking him to do a \"[[Z80]] version of MS-DOS\" for the MSX standard.<ref name=\"InfoWorld_Paterson_MSX-DOS\">{{cite web|first=Scott|last=Mace|authorlink=Scott Mace|title=''Floppy Disk-Drive for PCjr to provide 256K of additional RAM'' - Infoworld Magazine p.15 vol.6 Issue 8, Framingham, MA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iC4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15 \n|date=1984-04-30|accessdate=2015-05-16|publisher=Wernerkai}}</ref> At the time, Paterson was busy trying to get the first product of his startup [[Falcon Systems]]<!-- Falcon Systems or Falcon Technology? --> ready to go, so he suggested a few other developers, but Allen said he had already asked. Allen was in a hurry to get it done and nobody else could meet his timeline. Allen and Paterson finally agreed, and on 17 August, they signed an agreement to do \"Z80 MS-DOS 1.25\" for US$100,000 and the rights for Paterson's company to distribute [[MS-DOS 2.0]], [[MS-DOS 2.5|2.5]], and [[MS-DOS 3.0|3.0]] with a hardware product without royalty.<ref name=\"Paterson_2014_MSX-DOS\">{{cite web|first=Tim|last=Paterson|authorlink=Tim Paterson|title=The History of MSX-DOS|url=http://www.msx.org/wiki/The_History_of_MSX-DOS|date=2014-02-17|accessdate=2014-05-31|publisher=Jorito, Maggoo, John Hassink, MSX Resource Center}}</ref>\n\nFor Paterson, this was mostly a translation process. He had already written a Z80-to-8086 assembly language translation program ([[TRANS.COM]]). In this case, he was manually translating in the other direction. Because MS-DOS 1.x was modelled after CP/M's [[application program interface|API]] and was able to run CP/M applications that had been source-level translated to 8086, that would mean, MSX-DOS would be able to run CP/M programs directly.<ref name=\"Paterson_2014_MSX-DOS\"/>\n\nFor this project, Paterson also wrote a Z80 emulator that ran under MS-DOS, which would allow him to do the entire development project under MS-DOS. The MSX-DOS he was writing had an [[I/O System (MS-DOS)|I/O System]] layer, that interfaced directly to the I/O System layer of the MS-DOS machine, that was running the emulation.  This gave MSX-DOS direct access and control of the disk format. Most of the core code was file management, so this was necessary to test it out.<ref name=\"Paterson_2014_MSX-DOS\"/>\n\nBy 2 October 1983, he had [[Microsoft BASIC]] and [[Microsoft M80]] [[macro assembler]] running under MSX-DOS. He finished coding [[COMMAND.COM]] a few days later. He worked out some bugs and demonstrated MSX-DOS to Paul Allen on 11 October. The beta test version was officially delivered on 26 October 1983. It included an [[easter egg (software)|easter egg]], that printed Paterson's name.  The name was encoded with FAT code, so it could not be found by simply searching the file. After delivery of the beta version, the code was sent to [[ASCII (company)|ASCII]] in Japan. They created the I/O System for the MSX machine. That code was developed by [[Jay Suzuki]]. He figured out the easter egg and added his name to it.<ref name=\"Paterson_2014_MSX-DOS\"/>\n \nASCII was having problems getting MSX-DOS working on the actual MSX machine. They had not provided an actual MSX machine to Paterson, and instead flew him to Tokyo on 28 January 1984 to help them. It turned out that ASCII had been modifying the code without telling Paterson, so they were not working from the same code base. Paterson spent three days in Tokyo figuring out the problems and came back to Seattle.<ref name=\"Paterson_2014_MSX-DOS\"/>\n \nChris Larson from Microsoft and Jay Suzuki visited Paterson in Seattle at the end of February and early March 1984. They brought an MSX machine with an [[in-circuit emulator]] (ICE) for debugging. They got everything working and on 23 April 1984, Microsoft accepted delivery and made the final payment for MSX-DOS to Paterson.<ref name=\"Paterson_2014_MSX-DOS\"/>\n\nAt the time MSX-DOS was written, there was only one popular disk operating system for 8-bit [[Intel 8080]] compatible microprocessors, which was [[Digital Research]]'s CP/M-80 system. It was also often used with [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] systems, because the Z80 used an extended 8080 architecture. Microsoft's own disk operating system was also inspired by CP/M.\n\nTo be able to run (slightly modified) CP/M software Microsoft decided to implement functionality similar to major parts of the CP/M BIOS, routines that CP/M systems used to do specific disk operating tasks, such as opening files, etc. Instead of basing the command processor on CP/M's [[CCP (CP/M)|CCP]], which was known for some user unfriendliness, a [[command line interpreter]] ([[COMMAND.COM]]) inspired on its MS-DOS counterpart was used.  Microsoft also chose its own [[FAT12]] file system over CP/M's filing methods. This ensured that MSX-DOS floppies could be used on an MS-DOS machine, and that only one single formatting and filing system would be used. This was an important decision, because CP/M disk were often not interchangeable between machines, incompatible disk formatting schemes being a factor in this.\n\nMicrosoft also added a standard set of disk commands to MSX-DOS, that were compatible with MS-DOS, but not with CP/M. Finally they converted their [[Pipeline (software)|pipelining]] system from MS-DOS to MSX-DOS. The resulting DOS was a system that was much user-friendlier than CP/M, but was (in principle) compatible with major CP/M software packages such as [[WordStar]],  [[Turbo Pascal]] and the \"M80\" assembler and \"L80\" linker.\n\n==Improved versions==\nLike MS-DOS 1.25, the first version of MSX-DOS did not have [[Subdirectory|subdirectories]], but in 1988 it evolved to version 2, offering facilities such as subdirectories, memory management and environment strings.
