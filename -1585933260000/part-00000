They have released three [[live album]]s, ''[[We Are Young & Free]]'' (2013), ''[[Youth Revival]]'' (2016) and ''[[III Live at Hillsong Conference|III Live]]'' (2018) as well as four [[studio album]]s, ''[[Youth Revival Acoustic]]'' (2017), ''[[III (Hillsong Young & Free album)|III]]'' (2018), ''[[III (Studio Sessions)]]'' (2019), and ''[[III (Reimagined)]]'' (2019). Additionally, the group have released two [[extended play]]s, ''[[This Is Living EP|This Is Living]]'' (2015) and ''We Are Young & Free (The Remixes) - EP'' (2015).\n\n==Background==\nThe group formed in 2012 out of [[Sydney]], Australia, where they were located at Hillsong Church. Their members are worship leaders, Aodhan King, Alexander Pappas, Tyler Douglass, Renee Sieff, Ben Tan, and Melodie Wagner. [[Hillsong United]] [launched in 1998], the original group, began when the members were all relatively young, because it was started as part of the youth ministry at Hillsong Church. As they evolved and started to mature, have families of their own, and take on adulthood, many people at the church felt that there was a need for a new group that would aim its message at younger people with a stimulating new sound.<ref name=\"CR Story\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Mountford|title=Hillsong Young & Free: The latest offshoot of the Australian movement |url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/Hillsong_Young__Free_The_latest_offshoot_of_the_Australian_movement/52762/p1/|publisher=[[Cross Rhythms]]|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"AM Bio\">{{cite web|first=David|last=Jeffries|title=Hillsong Young & Free : Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hillsong-young-free-mn0003139286/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"BB Interview\">{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Askar|title=Hillsong Young & Free on New Live Album 'Youth Revival': 'The Focus Is on the Message' |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6890367/hillsong-young-free-interview-youth-revival-album-interview|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=28 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"CCM Interview\">{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Ritchie |title=Hillsong Young & Free Q&A |url=https://www.ccmmagazine.com/features/hillsong-young-free-qa/ |magazine=[[CCM Magazine]] |accessdate=31 March 2016 |date=31 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nHillsong Young & Free released their first [[live album]], ''We Are Young & Free'', on 1 October 2013.<ref name=\"AM Review\">{{cite web|first=Andree|last=Farias|title=''We Are Young & Free'' - Hillsong Young & Free : Review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/we-are-young-free-live-mw0002562111|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"NRT Review One\">{{cite web|first=Marcus|last=Hathcock |title=Singing a Song to Fill the Void|url=http://www.newreleasetoday.com/userprofile_reviewssinglepost.php?review_id=21758&user_id=8571|publisher=New Release Today|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=1 October 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"LTtM Review One\">{{cite web|first=Jono|last=Davies|title=Reviews - Hillsong Young & Free - We Are Young & Free |url=http://www.louderthanthemusic.com/document.php?id=3953|publisher=Louder Than the Music|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=6 September 2013}}</ref> The album debuted and peaked at No. 6 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]] in Australia,<ref name=\"AUS\"/> also charting on several [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] charts in the United States, peaking at No. 22 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and No. 1 on the [[Christian Albums]] chart.<ref name=\"AM Awards\">{{cite web|author=[[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]|title=Hillsong Young & Free : Awards |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hillsong-young-free-mn0003139286/awards|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref> Their subsequent release an [[extended play]], ''This Is Living'', was released on 11 January 2015.<ref name=\"WL Review One\">{{cite web|first=Brendan|last=Prout|title=Hillsong Young & Free: ''This Is Living''|url=https://worshipleader.com/albums/this-is-living/|magazine=[[Worship Leader (magazine)|Worship Leader]]|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=10 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313210205/http://worshipleader.com/albums/this-is-living/|archive-date=13 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"NRT Review Two\">{{cite web|first=Caitlin|last=Lassiter|title=The Voice of A New Generation |url=http://www.newreleasetoday.com/userprofile_reviewssinglepost.php?review_id=22814&user_id=130961|publisher=New Release Today|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=15 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"LTtM Review Two\">{{cite web|first=Jono|last=Davies|title=Reviews - Hillsong Young & Free - This Is Living |url=http://www.louderthanthemusic.com/document.php?id=4674|publisher=Louder Than the Music|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=21 January 2015}}</ref> The release charted on the ''Billboard'' 200 at No. 38 and No. 1 on the Christian Albums chart.

They have released three [[live album]]s, ''[[We Are Young & Free]]'' (2013), ''[[Youth Revival]]'' (2016) and ''[[III Live at Hillsong Conference|III Live]]'' (2018) as well as four [[studio album]]s, ''[[Youth Revival Acoustic]]'' (2017), ''[[III (Hillsong Young & Free album)|III]]'' (2018), ''[[III (Studio Sessions)]]'' (2019), and ''[[III (Reimagined)]]'' (2019). Additionally, the group have released two [[extended play]]s, ''[[This Is Living EP|This Is Living]]'' (2015) and ''We Are Young & Free (The Remixes) - EP'' (2015).\n\n==Background==\nThe group formed in 2012 out of [[Sydney]], Australia, where they were located at Hillsong Church. Their members are worship leaders, Aodhan King, Alexander Pappas, Tyler Douglass, Renee Sieff, Ben Tan, and Melodie Wagner. [[Hillsong United]] [launched in 1998], the original group, began when the members were all relatively young, because it was started as part of the youth ministry at Hillsong Church. As they evolved and started to mature, have families of their own, and take on adulthood, many people at the church felt that there was a need for a new group that would aim its message at younger people with a stimulating new sound.<ref name=\"CR Story\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Mountford|title=Hillsong Young & Free: The latest offshoot of the Australian movement |url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/Hillsong_Young__Free_The_latest_offshoot_of_the_Australian_movement/52762/p1/|publisher=[[Cross Rhythms]]|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"AM Bio\">{{cite web|first=David|last=Jeffries|title=Hillsong Young & Free : Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hillsong-young-free-mn0003139286/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"BB Interview\">{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Askar|title=Hillsong Young & Free on New Live Album 'Youth Revival': 'The Focus Is on the Message' |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6890367/hillsong-young-free-interview-youth-revival-album-interview|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=28 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"CCM Interview\">{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Ritchie |title=Hillsong Young & Free Q&A |url=https://www.ccmmagazine.com/features/hillsong-young-free-qa/ |magazine=[[CCM Magazine]] |accessdate=31 March 2016 |date=31 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nHillsong Young & Free released their first [[live album]], ''We Are Young & Free'', on 1 October 2013.<ref name=\"AM Review\">{{cite web|first=Andree|last=Farias|title=''We Are Young & Free'' - Hillsong Young & Free : Review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/we-are-young-free-live-mw0002562111|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"NRT Review One\">{{cite web|first=Marcus|last=Hathcock |title=Singing a Song to Fill the Void|url=http://www.newreleasetoday.com/userprofile_reviewssinglepost.php?review_id=21758&user_id=8571|publisher=New Release Today|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=1 October 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"LTtM Review One\">{{cite web|first=Jono|last=Davies|title=Reviews - Hillsong Young & Free - We Are Young & Free |url=http://www.louderthanthemusic.com/document.php?id=3953|publisher=Louder Than the Music|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=6 September 2013}}</ref> The album debuted and peaked at No. 6 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]] in Australia,<ref name=\"AUS\"/> also charting on several [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] charts in the United States, peaking at No. 22 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and No. 1 on the [[Christian Albums]] chart.<ref name=\"AM Awards\">{{cite web|author=[[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]|title=Hillsong Young & Free : Awards |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hillsong-young-free-mn0003139286/awards|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref> Their subsequent release an [[extended play]], ''This Is Living'', was released on 11 January 2015.<ref name=\"WL Review One\">{{cite web|first=Brendan|last=Prout|title=Hillsong Young & Free: ''This Is Living''|url=https://worshipleader.com/albums/this-is-living/|magazine=[[Worship Leader (magazine)|Worship Leader]]|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=10 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313210205/http://worshipleader.com/albums/this-is-living/|archive-date=13 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"NRT Review Two\">{{cite web|first=Caitlin|last=Lassiter|title=The Voice of A New Generation |url=http://www.newreleasetoday.com/userprofile_reviewssinglepost.php?review_id=22814&user_id=130961|publisher=New Release Today|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=15 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"LTtM Review Two\">{{cite web|first=Jono|last=Davies|title=Reviews - Hillsong Young & Free - This Is Living |url=http://www.louderthanthemusic.com/document.php?id=4674|publisher=Louder Than the Music|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=21 January 2015}}</ref> The release charted on the ''Billboard'' 200 at No. 38 and No. 1 on the Christian Albums chart.

It is narrated by [[Diana Nyad]].\n\nThe documentary, subtitled as ''No Drinking, No Drugs, No Lesbians'' is a Woman Vision film. Director Mosbacher, a lesbian feminist activist filmmaker and psychiatrist established Woman Vision as a nonprofit organization, to promote tolerance and equal treatment of all people through the production and use of educational media,\n\n''Training Rules'' examines how women's [[collegiate sports]], caught in a web of [[homophobia|homophobic]] practices, collude in the destruction of the lives and dreams of many of its most talented athletes. It focuses on the [[women's basketball]] program at [[Pennsylvania State University]] under head coach [[Rene Portland]] and her policy of discrimination on her players based on their [[sexual orientation]] over a 27-year period as coach of the university's basketball program, particularly from the 1980s to the late 1990s.\n\n==Characters==\nAccording to testimony in the documentary, Rene Portland, who became Penn State's women's basketball coach in 1980, was open with her recruits about her distaste for [[gay]] individuals.

Cindy Davies was another talented young basketball player struggling with her sexuality in the 1980s.

It focuses on the [[women's basketball]] program at [[Pennsylvania State University]] under head coach [[Rene Portland]] and her policy of discrimination on her players based on their [[sexual orientation]] over a 27-year period as coach of the university's basketball program, particularly from the 1980s to the late 1990s.\n\n==Characters==\nAccording to testimony in the documentary, Rene Portland, who became Penn State's women's basketball coach in 1980, was open with her recruits about her distaste for [[gay]] individuals.

The system consists of infrastructure and standards for the presentation and distribution of public alerts issued by government authorities (including [[Environment and Climate Change Canada]] and other provincial public safety agencies), such as weather emergencies, [[AMBER Alert]]s, and other emergency notifications, by all broadcasters and [[last mile]] distributors in the affected region, including [[television station]]s, [[radio station]]s, [[broadcast distribution undertaking|television provider]]s, and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] [[mobile network]]s in the affected region.\n\nThe system is based upon the [[Common Alerting Protocol]], and uses the National Alert Aggregation and Dissemination system (NAAD) operated by [[Pelmorex Media]] as its backend for distributing alerts to broadcasters, in consort with a [[style guide]] that dictates when and how alerts are to be broadcast. Pelmorex also handles public marketing of the system. \n\nIn development since 2010, the system officially launched on March 31, 2015; under [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) rules, all radio and television broadcasters, as well as all digital broadcast distribution undertakings, are required to relay emergency messages issued through NAAD. As of April 2018, wireless providers are also required to participate ('''Wireless Public Alerting System'''), utilizing a Canadian variant of the [[Wireless Emergency Alerts]] framework utilized in the United States. WPAS is promoted by Pelmorex as part of Alert Ready.\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada also maintains [[Weatheradio Canada]], which transmits weather information and hazard alerts. Unlike Alert Ready, it utilizes [[Specific Area Message Encoding]] (SAME)\u2014the same protocol used by [[NOAA Weather Radio]] and the [[Emergency Alert System]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/weatheradio/network.html|title=Weatheradio network|website=Environment and Climate Change Canada|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/weatheradio/find-your-network/general-information.html|title=Weatheradio Canada: general information|website=Environment and Climate Change Canada|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Proposals ===\nVarious attempts had been made in the 21st century to establish a public alert system in Canada, by both departments of government and by television broadcasters. In 2001, [[Pelmorex]], owners of [[The Weather Network]] and its [[French language]] counterpart [[M\u00e9t\u00e9oM\u00e9dia]], applied to the CRTC for an amendment to their licenses to encompass a mandatory \"All Channel Alert\" system, requiring all television providers to relay emergency messages on behalf of governments across all of their channels. The service would have used proprietary hardware developed by Pelmorex, and would have been funded primarily by a [[Canadian dollar|$]]0.13 increase in carriage fees for the two channels. However, its initial proposal was denied by the CRTC, citing the need for consultation with broadcasters, television providers, and other parties on how the system would be designed, along with its costs. There were also concerns over the means in which the system was to be implemented technologically, and that the system was not inclusive to the visually impaired because Pelmorex only specified use of a text [[news ticker|crawl]], without an audio component.<ref name=crtc-2007-20>{{cite news|title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-20|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/pb2007-20.htm|accessdate=14 April 2015|publisher=CRTC}}</ref><ref name=crtc-2001-123>{{cite web|title=Decision CRTC 2001-123|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2001/DB2001-123.htm|website=CRTC|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref> \n\nEstablishment of such a system in a voluntary form was hampered by CRTC rules at the time, which required television providers to obtain consent from broadcasters before they could overlay emergency notifications onto their programming.<ref name=crtc-2007-20/> In 2005, CRTC called for proposals regarding a national alerting system; Pelmorex and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] submitted proposals for a national system, while [[Bell ExpressVu]] submitted a proposal requesting the removal of the consent requirement. The CBC's proposal would have fed alerts via satellite to decoders installed at local [[CBC Radio]] transmitters. It would have allowed television providers to participate on a voluntary basis by installing decoders of their own, if the aforementioned consent requirement were removed. All three applicants promised to adopt the standardized alerting specifications that were developed by the government-backed CANALERT initiative.<ref name=crtc-2007-20/>\n\nWhile broadcasters and governments supported the proposals for a national alerting system, [[Bell Media|CTV]], [[Canwest Global]] and [[CHUM Limited]] showed concerns surrounding the Pelmorex proposal, as it would be operated by a for-profit venture that would have the power to override their signals with third-party content, and be redundant to alerts already provided as a public service by some broadcasters. [[Shaw Communications|Shaw]] and [[Rogers Communications|Rogers]] argued that the Pelmorex system was less cost-efficient than the CBC's proposal. It was also disputed whether the CRTC could even order the mandatory distribution of the service, as the CRTC does not regulate alphanumeric content because it is not considered television programming. In 2007, the CRTC removed the consent requirement to ease the adoption of voluntary alerting by broadcast distribution undertakings, but stated that it would reconsider the possibility of a mandatory alert system in the future.<ref name=crtc-2007-20/>\n\n=== Development ===\nIn 2009, the CRTC approved a proposal by Pelmorex to grant [[must-carry]] status to The Weather Network and M\u00e9t\u00e9oM\u00e9dia on digital television services. As part of the proposal, Pelmorex committed to developing a \"national aggregator and distributor\" (NAAD) of localized emergency alert messages compliant with the [[Common Alerting Protocol]]. Pelmorex established a governance council for the system, including representatives of the broadcasting industry, federal government, members of the Senior Officials Responsible for Emergency Management (SOREM), and the Canadian Association for Public Alerting and Notification, to oversee its operations. NAAD would become operational in 2010.<ref name=crtc-mandate/><ref name=crtc-2009-340/><ref name=crtc-naad/>\n\nIn a 2011 renewal of the must-carry status, the CRTC praised Pelmorex's work, considering the NAAD system to be \"an essential element of a national public alerting system\", and expressed an expectation for all broadcasters to voluntarily participate in distributing its alerts. However, as a condition of the renewal, the CRTC ordered Pelmorex to reach agreements with all federal, provincial and territorial emergency management officials to allow them to transmit messages through the system, implement the capability of processing \"broadcast intrusive alerts\" through the system, and develop a public awareness campaign surrounding the alert system with a budget of at least $1 million per-year.<ref name=crtc-mandate>{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2014-444 and Broadcasting Orders CRTC 2014-445, 2014-446, 2014-447 and 2014-448|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2014/2014-444.htm|website=CRTC|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=crtc-2009-340>{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Order CRTC 2009-340|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2009/2009-340.htm|website=CRTC|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=crtc-naad>{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-438|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-438.htm|publisher=CRTC|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref> In June of the same year, the province of [[Alberta]] launched a new alerting system of its own, [[Alberta Emergency Alert]], which distributes alerts on radio and television, as well as online and via [[social networking service]]s.<ref name=\"cbc=aea\">{{cite web|title=Alberta emergency system goes digital|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-emergency-system-goes-digital-1.993701|website=CBC News|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=cbc-aeavoice>{{cite web|title=Digital alert system hard to decipher: critics|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/digital-alert-system-hard-to-decipher-critics-1.1032381|website=CBC News|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> This replaced the previous [[Emergency Public Warning System]] which had been used since 1992.\n\n[[Environment Canada]], the Canadian Council of Emergency Management Organizations, and the provinces of [[Manitoba]] and [[New Brunswick]] endorsed the potential use of the NAAD framework as a backend for a mandatory public alerting system.<ref name=crtc-naad/><ref name=crtc-consultation2014-85/> On May 26, 2013, SOREM published a \"Common Look and Feel\" specification for alerts.

Community, campus, and aboriginal broadcasters were given an extended deadline of March 31, 2016 to implement the system.<ref name=crtc-mandate/> The National Public Alerting System was launched on March 31, 2015 under the public-facing brand '''Alert Ready''' (French: '''En Alerte''').<ref name=twn-alertready>{{cite web|title=New emergency-warning system launches in Canada|url=http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/alert-ready-is-canadas-new-national-emergency-alert-system/48567/|website=The Weather Network|publisher=Pelmorex|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Bell TV]], [[Manitoba Telecom Services|MTS]], Shaw Direct, and [[Sogetel]] do not fully participate in the system, as some of their customers utilize legacy [[set-top box]]es that cannot be updated to support the display of public alerts.

Messages are formatted using the Canadian Profile of the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP-CP), and are provided in at least one of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|Canada's official languages]] (either [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], or both, as determined by local policies and laws). Alerts can contain text and audio components, and contain information designating the region that an alert applies to.<ref name=npas-clf/>\n\n{{Listen|filename=Canadian Alerting Attention Signal.ogg|title=Canadian Alerting Attention Signal|}}\nMessages marked with \"Broadcast Immediately\" flags are used to designate alerts that present \"an imminent or unexpected threat to life, that alerting officials wish to be distributed and presented to the public as soon as possible, even if it means disrupting the programming of last mile distributors.\" On television and radio, relevant alerts marked with this flag are immediately presented to viewers when they are received, interrupting programming to facilitate their display. These alerts are prefaced by the Canadian Alerting Attention Signal. The attention signal is an 8-second sequence of alternating half-second duration complex tones, the first being a combination of tones at frequencies of 932.33 Hz, 1046.5 Hz and 3135.96 Hz, and the second at 440 Hz, 659.26 Hz and 3135.96 Hz (the same signal that is used by Alberta Emergency Alert).

Crawlers inserted by television channels are positioned at the centre of the screen out of respect for those inserted by broadcast distribution undertakings at the bottom of the screen.

Wireless alerts on devices specifically supporting Cell Broadcast alerts utilize the same attention signal sound and a specific vibration pattern mimicking this sound.

Gurney thus argued that in such a situation, those who were not awake could learn the details of the alert in the morning instead. He also acknowledged similar opinions presented by Philip Cross in an editorial for its sister publication, the ''[[Financial Post]]''; Cross felt that AMBER Alerts on phones should be optional as in the U.S., comparing the disruption of sleep caused by late-night alerts to health effects associated with [[daylight saving time]], and noting that the public would be \"more likely to arrive at better solutions if we can discuss the issue sanely, [[Think of the children|rather than have all complaints dismissed as callous disregard for children's safety]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/opinion/matt-gurney-an-easy-way-to-end-the-stupid-amber-alert-whining-drop-the-buzzing-alarm|title=Matt Gurney: An easy way to end the stupid Amber Alert whining \u2014 drop the buzzing alarm|work=National Post|last=Gurney|first=Matt|date=2019-07-30|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/philip-cross-we-need-to-fix-the-amber-alert-system|title=Philip Cross: We need to fix the Amber Alert system|work=Financial Post|last=Cross|first=Philip |date=2019-07-30|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> In response to an Ontario AMBER Alert that concluded with the victim found murdered, a ''[[Macleans]]'' editor had deemed all critics of the system to be \"horrible\" and expressing [[Generation Snowflake|entitlement]] for their refusal to participate in the civic duty of locating a missing child in imminent danger.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/you-are-horrible-people/|title=You are horrible people|website=Macleans.ca|access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, a 70-year old resident of [[Hamilton, Ontario]] was charged with [[mischief]] for disrupting emergency services, after repeatedly calling 9-1-1 to complain about an AMBER Alert broadcast.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9628245-he-called-911-to-complain-about-the-amber-alert-hamilton-police-charged-him-with-mischief/|title=He called 911 to complain about the Amber Alert.

It was considered common practice for officers to log into the live system first to ensure it is functioning before switching to a secondary, internal instance of the system designed specifically for testing purposes.

The system consists of infrastructure and standards for the presentation and distribution of public alerts issued by government authorities (including [[Environment and Climate Change Canada]] and other provincial public safety agencies), such as weather emergencies, [[AMBER Alert]]s, and other emergency notifications, by all broadcasters and [[last mile]] distributors in the affected region, including [[television station]]s, [[radio station]]s, [[broadcast distribution undertaking|television provider]]s, and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] [[mobile network]]s in the affected region.\n\nThe system is based upon the [[Common Alerting Protocol]], and uses the National Alert Aggregation and Dissemination system (NAAD) operated by [[Pelmorex Media]] as its backend for distributing alerts to broadcasters, in consort with a [[style guide]] that dictates when and how alerts are to be broadcast. Pelmorex also handles public marketing of the system. \n\nIn development since 2010, the system officially launched on March 31, 2015; under [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) rules, all radio and television broadcasters, as well as all digital broadcast distribution undertakings, are required to relay emergency messages issued through NAAD. As of April 2018, wireless providers are also required to participate ('''Wireless Public Alerting System'''), utilizing a Canadian variant of the [[Wireless Emergency Alerts]] framework utilized in the United States. WPAS is promoted by Pelmorex as part of Alert Ready.\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada also maintains [[Weatheradio Canada]], which transmits weather information and hazard alerts. Unlike Alert Ready, it utilizes [[Specific Area Message Encoding]] (SAME)\u2014the same protocol used by [[NOAA Weather Radio]] and the [[Emergency Alert System]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/weatheradio/network.html|title=Weatheradio network|website=Environment and Climate Change Canada|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/weatheradio/find-your-network/general-information.html|title=Weatheradio Canada: general information|website=Environment and Climate Change Canada|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Proposals ===\nVarious attempts had been made in the 21st century to establish a public alert system in Canada, by both departments of government and by television broadcasters. In 2001, [[Pelmorex]], owners of [[The Weather Network]] and its [[French language]] counterpart [[M\u00e9t\u00e9oM\u00e9dia]], applied to the CRTC for an amendment to their licenses to encompass a mandatory \"All Channel Alert\" system, requiring all television providers to relay emergency messages on behalf of governments across all of their channels. The service would have used proprietary hardware developed by Pelmorex, and would have been funded primarily by a [[Canadian dollar|$]]0.13 increase in carriage fees for the two channels. However, its initial proposal was denied by the CRTC, citing the need for consultation with broadcasters, television providers, and other parties on how the system would be designed, along with its costs. There were also concerns over the means in which the system was to be implemented technologically, and that the system was not inclusive to the visually impaired because Pelmorex only specified use of a text [[news ticker|crawl]], without an audio component.<ref name=crtc-2007-20>{{cite news|title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-20|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/pb2007-20.htm|accessdate=14 April 2015|publisher=CRTC}}</ref><ref name=crtc-2001-123>{{cite web|title=Decision CRTC 2001-123|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2001/DB2001-123.htm|website=CRTC|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref> \n\nEstablishment of such a system in a voluntary form was hampered by CRTC rules at the time, which required television providers to obtain consent from broadcasters before they could overlay emergency notifications onto their programming.<ref name=crtc-2007-20/> In 2005, CRTC called for proposals regarding a national alerting system; Pelmorex and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] submitted proposals for a national system, while [[Bell ExpressVu]] submitted a proposal requesting the removal of the consent requirement. The CBC's proposal would have fed alerts via satellite to decoders installed at local [[CBC Radio]] transmitters. It would have allowed television providers to participate on a voluntary basis by installing decoders of their own, if the aforementioned consent requirement were removed. All three applicants promised to adopt the standardized alerting specifications that were developed by the government-backed CANALERT initiative.<ref name=crtc-2007-20/>\n\nWhile broadcasters and governments supported the proposals for a national alerting system, [[Bell Media|CTV]], [[Canwest Global]] and [[CHUM Limited]] showed concerns surrounding the Pelmorex proposal, as it would be operated by a for-profit venture that would have the power to override their signals with third-party content, and be redundant to alerts already provided as a public service by some broadcasters. [[Shaw Communications|Shaw]] and [[Rogers Communications|Rogers]] argued that the Pelmorex system was less cost-efficient than the CBC's proposal. It was also disputed whether the CRTC could even order the mandatory distribution of the service, as the CRTC does not regulate alphanumeric content because it is not considered television programming. In 2007, the CRTC removed the consent requirement to ease the adoption of voluntary alerting by broadcast distribution undertakings, but stated that it would reconsider the possibility of a mandatory alert system in the future.<ref name=crtc-2007-20/>\n\n=== Development ===\nIn 2009, the CRTC approved a proposal by Pelmorex to grant [[must-carry]] status to The Weather Network and M\u00e9t\u00e9oM\u00e9dia on digital television services. As part of the proposal, Pelmorex committed to developing a \"national aggregator and distributor\" (NAAD) of localized emergency alert messages compliant with the [[Common Alerting Protocol]]. Pelmorex established a governance council for the system, including representatives of the broadcasting industry, federal government, members of the Senior Officials Responsible for Emergency Management (SOREM), and the Canadian Association for Public Alerting and Notification, to oversee its operations. NAAD would become operational in 2010.<ref name=crtc-mandate/><ref name=crtc-2009-340/><ref name=crtc-naad/>\n\nIn a 2011 renewal of the must-carry status, the CRTC praised Pelmorex's work, considering the NAAD system to be \"an essential element of a national public alerting system\", and expressed an expectation for all broadcasters to voluntarily participate in distributing its alerts. However, as a condition of the renewal, the CRTC ordered Pelmorex to reach agreements with all federal, provincial and territorial emergency management officials to allow them to transmit messages through the system, implement the capability of processing \"broadcast intrusive alerts\" through the system, and develop a public awareness campaign surrounding the alert system with a budget of at least $1 million per-year.<ref name=crtc-mandate>{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2014-444 and Broadcasting Orders CRTC 2014-445, 2014-446, 2014-447 and 2014-448|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2014/2014-444.htm|website=CRTC|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=crtc-2009-340>{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Order CRTC 2009-340|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2009/2009-340.htm|website=CRTC|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=crtc-naad>{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-438|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-438.htm|publisher=CRTC|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref> In June of the same year, the province of [[Alberta]] launched a new alerting system of its own, [[Alberta Emergency Alert]], which distributes alerts on radio and television, as well as online and via [[social networking service]]s.<ref name=\"cbc=aea\">{{cite web|title=Alberta emergency system goes digital|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-emergency-system-goes-digital-1.993701|website=CBC News|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=cbc-aeavoice>{{cite web|title=Digital alert system hard to decipher: critics|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/digital-alert-system-hard-to-decipher-critics-1.1032381|website=CBC News|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> This replaced the previous [[Emergency Public Warning System]] which had been used since 1992.\n\n[[Environment Canada]], the Canadian Council of Emergency Management Organizations, and the provinces of [[Manitoba]] and [[New Brunswick]] endorsed the potential use of the NAAD framework as a backend for a mandatory public alerting system.<ref name=crtc-naad/><ref name=crtc-consultation2014-85/> On May 26, 2013, SOREM published a \"Common Look and Feel\" specification for alerts.

Messages are formatted using the Canadian Profile of the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP-CP), and are provided in at least one of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|Canada's official languages]] (either [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], or both, as determined by local policies and laws). Alerts can contain text and audio components, and contain information designating the region that an alert applies to.<ref name=npas-clf/>\n\n{{Listen|filename=Canadian Alerting Attention Signal.ogg|title=Canadian Alerting Attention Signal|}}\nMessages marked with \"Broadcast Immediately\" flags are used to designate alerts that present \"an imminent or unexpected threat to life, that alerting officials wish to be distributed and presented to the public as soon as possible, even if it means disrupting the programming of last mile distributors.\" On television and radio, relevant alerts marked with this flag are immediately presented to viewers when they are received, interrupting programming to facilitate their display. These alerts are prefaced by the Canadian Alerting Attention Signal. The attention signal is an 8-second sequence of alternating half-second duration complex tones, the first being a combination of tones at frequencies of 932.33 Hz, 1046.5 Hz and 3135.96 Hz, and the second at 440 Hz, 659.26 Hz and 3135.96 Hz (the same signal that is used by Alberta Emergency Alert).

He also acknowledged similar opinions presented by Philip Cross in an editorial for its sister publication, the ''[[Financial Post]]''; Cross felt that AMBER Alerts on phones should be optional as in the U.S., comparing the disruption of sleep caused by late-night alerts to health effects associated with [[daylight saving time]], and noting that the public would be \"more likely to arrive at better solutions if we can discuss the issue sanely, [[Think of the children|rather than have all complaints dismissed as callous disregard for children's safety]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/opinion/matt-gurney-an-easy-way-to-end-the-stupid-amber-alert-whining-drop-the-buzzing-alarm|title=Matt Gurney: An easy way to end the stupid Amber Alert whining \u2014 drop the buzzing alarm|work=National Post|last=Gurney|first=Matt|date=2019-07-30|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/philip-cross-we-need-to-fix-the-amber-alert-system|title=Philip Cross: We need to fix the Amber Alert system|work=Financial Post|last=Cross|first=Philip |date=2019-07-30|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> In response to an Ontario AMBER Alert that concluded with the victim found murdered, a ''[[Macleans]]'' editor had deemed all critics of the system to be \"horrible\" and expressing [[Generation Snowflake|entitlement]] for their refusal to participate in the civic duty of locating a missing child in imminent danger.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/you-are-horrible-people/|title=You are horrible people|website=Macleans.ca|access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, a 70-year old resident of [[Hamilton, Ontario]] was charged with [[mischief]] for disrupting emergency services, after repeatedly calling 9-1-1 to complain about an AMBER Alert broadcast.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9628245-he-called-911-to-complain-about-the-amber-alert-hamilton-police-charged-him-with-mischief/|title=He called 911 to complain about the Amber Alert.
