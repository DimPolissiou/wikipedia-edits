As a teenager he was introduced into the high society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', ''[[Private Lives]]'', ''[[Design for Living]]'', ''[[Present Laughter]]'' and ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'', have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta ''[[Bitter Sweet]]'' and comic [[revue]]s), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel ''Pomp and Circumstance'', and a three-volume autobiography. Coward's stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works, as well as those of others.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War Coward volunteered for war work, running the British propaganda office in Paris. He also worked with the Secret Service, seeking to use his influence to persuade the American public and government to help Britain. Coward won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1943 for his naval film drama ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1969. In the 1950s he achieved fresh success as a cabaret performer, performing his own songs, such as \"[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]\", \"[[London Pride (song)|London Pride]]\" and \"[[I Went to a Marvellous Party]]\".\n\nCoward's plays and songs achieved new popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, and his work and style continue to influence popular culture. He did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including [[Graham Payn]], his long-time partner, and in Coward's diaries and letters, published posthumously. The former Albery Theatre (originally the New Theatre) in London was renamed the [[No\u00ebl Coward Theatre]] in his honour in 2006.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nCoward was born in 1899 in [[Teddington]], [[Middlesex]], a south-western suburb of London.

Although he had little luck, he found the Broadway theatre stimulating.<ref name=Kenrick1 /> He absorbed its smartness and pace into his own work, which brought him his first real success as a playwright with ''The Young Idea''.

During the run of ''The Vortex'', Coward met [[John C. Wilson|Jack Wilson]], an American stockbroker (later a director and producer), who became his business manager and lover.

In ''Private Lives'', Coward starred alongside his most famous stage partner, Gertrude Lawrence, together with the young [[Laurence Olivier]]. It was a highlight of both Coward's and Lawrence's career, selling out in both London and New York. Coward disliked long runs, and after this he made a rule of starring in a play for no more than three months at any venue.<ref name=Kenrick2 /> ''Design for Living'', written for [[Alfred Lunt]] and [[Lynn Fontanne]], was so risqu\u00e9, with its theme of bisexuality and a ''m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois'', that Coward premiered it in New York, knowing that it would not survive the censor in London.<ref>Hoare, p. 249</ref>\n\n[[File:Novello-lunt-fontanne-campbell.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ivor Novello]], ''top l''., [[Alfred Lunt]], ''top r''., [[Lynn Fontanne]], ''lower l''. and [[Judy Campbell]]{{snd}}stars of Coward premi\u00e8res of the 1920s{{ndash}}1940s]]\nIn 1933 Coward wrote, directed and co-starred with the French singer [[Yvonne Printemps]] in both London and New York productions of an operetta, ''[[Conversation Piece (musical)|Conversation Piece]]'' (1933).<ref name=Kenrick2 /> He next wrote, directed and co-starred with Lawrence in ''[[Tonight at 8.30]]'' (1936), a cycle of ten short plays, presented in various permutations across three evenings.{{#tag:ref|The cycle effectively comprised only nine plays: although Coward wrote ten works for the cycle, ''[[Star Chamber (play)|Star Chamber]]'' was dropped after a single performance.<ref>Hoare, pp. 268\u201370</ref>|group= n}} One of these plays, ''[[Still Life (play)|Still Life]]'', was expanded into the 1945 [[David Lean]] film ''[[Brief Encounter]]''.<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 226\u201328 and 230</ref> ''Tonight at 8.30'' was followed by a musical, ''[[Operette (musical)|Operette]]'' (1938), from which the most famous number is \"The Stately Homes of England\", and a revue entitled ''[[Set to Music]]'' (1938, a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] version of his 1932 London revue, ''Words and Music'').<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 237 and 239</ref> Coward's last pre-war plays were ''[[This Happy Breed]]'', a drama about a working-class family, and ''[[Present Laughter]]'', a comic self-caricature with an egomaniac actor as the central character.

Despite his disappointments, Coward maintained a high public profile; his performance as King Magnus in Shaw's ''[[The Apple Cart]]'' for the Coronation season of 1953, co-starring [[Margaret Leighton]], received much coverage in the press,<ref>\"Haymarket Theatre\", ''The Times'', 8 May 1953, p. 12; and Brown, Ivor. \"Royal and Ancient\", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 8 May 1953, p. 5</ref> and his cabaret act, honed during his wartime tours entertaining the troops, was a supreme success, first in London at the [[Caf\u00e9 de Paris (London)|Caf\u00e9 de Paris]], and later in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]].<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 339\u201340</ref> The theatre critic Kenneth Tynan wrote:\n{{quote|To see him whole, public and private personalities conjoined, you must see him in cabaret&nbsp;... he padded down the celebrated stairs{{space}}... halted before the microphone on black-suede-clad feet, and, upraising both hands in a gesture of benediction, set about demonstrating how these things should be done. Baring his teeth as if unveiling some grotesque monument, and cooing like a [[baritone]] dove, he gave us \"I'll See You Again\" and the other bat's-wing melodies of his youth. Nothing he does on these occasions sounds strained or arid; his tanned, leathery face is still an enthusiast's.... If it is possible to romp fastidiously, that is what Coward does. He owes little to earlier wits, such as [[Oscar Wilde|Wilde]] or [[Henry Labouch\u00e8re|Labouchere]]. Their best things need to be delivered slowly, even lazily.

Despite this impressive cast, Coward's popularity had risen so high that the theatre poster for the production used an [[Al Hirschfeld]] caricature of Coward (''pictured'') {{#tag:ref|The caricature was also used in connection with other Coward works, for example on his album of his ballet suite, \"London Morning\" (1959; reissued in 1978 on LP on DRG SL 5180 with the Hirschfeld drawing on the cover)|group= n}} instead of an image of the production or its stars.

The show has a cast of more than fifty and has never been professionally revived in London.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 270\u2013271</ref> A third musical with a historical setting, ''Operette'', ran for 133 performances in 1938 and closed for lack of box-office business. Coward later described it as \"over-written and under-composed\", with too much plot and too few good numbers.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 326 and 336\u2013337</ref> He persisted with a romantic historical theme with ''Pacific 1860'' (1946), another work with a huge cast. It ran for 129 performances, and Coward's failure to keep up with public tastes was pointed up by the success of the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] show that followed ''Pacific 1860'' at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]]: ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' ran there for 1,534 performances.<ref>Gaye, p. 1525</ref> His friend and biographer Cole Lesley wrote that although Coward admired ''Oklahoma!'' enormously, he \"did not learn from it and the change it had brought about, that the songs should in some way further the storyline.\"<ref name=cl196>Lesley, p. 196</ref> Lesley added that Coward compounded this error by managing \"in every single show to write one song, nothing whatever to do with the plot, that was an absolute showstopper\".<ref name=cl196/>\n\nWith ''Ace of Clubs'' (1949) Coward sought to be up-to-date, with the setting of a contemporary [[Soho]] nightclub. It did better than its three predecessors, running for 211 performances, but Coward wrote, \"I am furious about ''Ace of Clubs'' not being a real smash and I have come to the conclusion that if they don't care for first rate music, lyrics, dialogue and performance they can stuff it up their collective arses and go and see <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Ivor Novello]]'s<nowiki>]</nowiki> ''[[King's Rhapsody]]''\".<ref>Lesley, p. 291</ref> He reverted, without success, to a romantic historical setting for ''After the Ball'' (1954 \u2013 188 performances).

March 1973) was an English playwright, composer, director, actor and singer, known for his wit, flamboyance, and what ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called \"a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise\".<ref name=Time1969>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941819-2,00.html \"Noel Coward at 70\",] ''Time'', 26 December 1969, accessed 2 May 2011</ref>\n\nCoward attended a dance academy in London as a child, making his professional stage d\u00e9but at the age of eleven. As a teenager he was introduced into the high society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', ''[[Private Lives]]'', ''[[Design for Living]]'', ''[[Present Laughter]]'' and ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'', have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta ''[[Bitter Sweet]]'' and comic [[revue]]s), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel ''Pomp and Circumstance'', and a three-volume autobiography. Coward's stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works, as well as those of others.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War Coward volunteered for war work, running the British propaganda office in Paris. He also worked with the Secret Service, seeking to use his influence to persuade the American public and government to help Britain. Coward won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1943 for his naval film drama ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1969. In the 1950s he achieved fresh success as a cabaret performer, performing his own songs, such as \"[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]\", \"[[London Pride (song)|London Pride]]\" and \"[[I Went to a Marvellous Party]]\".\n\nCoward's plays and songs achieved new popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, and his work and style continue to influence popular culture. He did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including [[Graham Payn]], his long-time partner, and in Coward's diaries and letters, published posthumously. The former Albery Theatre (originally the New Theatre) in London was renamed the [[No\u00ebl Coward Theatre]] in his honour in 2006.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nCoward was born in 1899 in [[Teddington]], [[Middlesex]], a south-western suburb of London. His parents were Arthur Sabin Coward (1856{{ndash}}1937), a piano salesman, and Violet Agnes Coward (1863{{ndash}}1954), daughter of [[s:A Naval Biographical Dictionary/Veitch, Henry Gordon|Henry Gordon Veitch]], a captain and surveyor in the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Morley (1974), p. 2</ref> Violet's cousin, Rachel Veitch, was mother of Field-Marshal [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]].<ref>Hoare, p. 2</ref> No\u00ebl Coward was the second of their three sons, the eldest of whom had died in 1898 at the age of six.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 3</ref> Coward's father lacked ambition and industry, and family finances were often poor.<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 4, 8 and 67</ref> Coward was bitten by the performing bug early and appeared in amateur concerts by the age of seven.

This seemed to dispose of all argument. I was a talented boy, God knows, and, when washed and smarmed down a bit, passably attractive.

Some writers have seen elements of Coward's old mentor, Mrs Astley Cooper, and her set in the characters of the family.<ref>Hoare, pp. 42\u201343</ref> By the 1970s the play was recognised as a classic, described in ''The Times'' as a \"dazzling achievement; like ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', it is pure comedy with no mission but to delight, and it depends purely on the interplay of characters, not on elaborate comic machinery.\"<ref name=timesobit /> By June 1925 Coward had four shows running in the West End: ''The Vortex'', ''Fallen Angels'', ''Hay Fever'' and ''[[On with the Dance (musical)|On with the Dance]]''.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 107</ref> Coward was turning out numerous plays and acting in his own works and others'.

By far the most successful was the first, ''Bitter Sweet'' (1929), which he termed an [[operetta]]. It ran in the West End for 697 performances between 1929 and 1931.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, p. 183; and Gaye, p. 1529</ref> ''Bitter Sweet'' was set in 19th-century Vienna and London; for his next musical, ''Conversation Piece'' (1934) Coward again chose a historical setting: [[Regency era|Regency]] [[Brighton]]. Notices were excellent, but the run ended after 177 performances when the leading lady, [[Yvonne Printemps]], had to leave the cast to honour a filming commitment. The show has a cast of more than fifty and has never been professionally revived in London.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 270\u2013271</ref> A third musical with a historical setting, ''Operette'', ran for 133 performances in 1938 and closed for lack of box-office business. Coward later described it as \"over-written and under-composed\", with too much plot and too few good numbers.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 326 and 336\u2013337</ref> He persisted with a romantic historical theme with ''Pacific 1860'' (1946), another work with a huge cast. It ran for 129 performances, and Coward's failure to keep up with public tastes was pointed up by the success of the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] show that followed ''Pacific 1860'' at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]]: ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' ran there for 1,534 performances.<ref>Gaye, p. 1525</ref> His friend and biographer Cole Lesley wrote that although Coward admired ''Oklahoma!'' enormously, he \"did not learn from it and the change it had brought about, that the songs should in some way further the storyline.\"<ref name=cl196>Lesley, p. 196</ref> Lesley added that Coward compounded this error by managing \"in every single show to write one song, nothing whatever to do with the plot, that was an absolute showstopper\".<ref name=cl196/>\n\nWith ''Ace of Clubs'' (1949) Coward sought to be up-to-date, with the setting of a contemporary [[Soho]] nightclub. It did better than its three predecessors, running for 211 performances, but Coward wrote, \"I am furious about ''Ace of Clubs'' not being a real smash and I have come to the conclusion that if they don't care for first rate music, lyrics, dialogue and performance they can stuff it up their collective arses and go and see <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Ivor Novello]]'s<nowiki>]</nowiki> ''[[King's Rhapsody]]''\".<ref>Lesley, p. 291</ref> He reverted, without success, to a romantic historical setting for ''After the Ball'' (1954 \u2013 188 performances). His last two musicals were premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] rather than in London. ''Sail Away'' (1961) with a setting on a modern cruise ship ran for 167 performances in New York and then 252 in London.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, p. 489; and Gaye, p. 1537</ref> For his last and least successful musical, Coward reverted to [[Ruritania]]n royalty in ''The Girl Who Came to Supper'' (1963), which closed after 112 performances in New York and has never been staged in London.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 500 and 510</ref>\n\nCoward's first contributions to revue were in 1922, writing most of the songs and some of the sketches in [[Andr\u00e9 Charlot]]'s ''London Calling!''. This was before his first major success as a playwright and actor, in ''The Vortex'', written the following year and staged in 1924. The revue contained only one song that features prominently in the No\u00ebl Coward Society's list of his most popular numbers \u2013 \"Parisian Pierrot\", sung by Gertrude Lawrence.<ref name=ncsongs/> His other early  revues, ''On With the Dance'' (1925) and ''This Year of Grace'' (1928) were liked by the press and public, and contained several songs that have remained well known, including \"Dance, Little Lady\", \"Poor Little Rich Girl\" and \"A Room With a View\".<ref name=ncsongs/><ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 128 and 171</ref> ''Words and Music'' (1932) and its Broadway successor ''Set to Music'' (1939) included \"Mad About the Boy\", \"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\", \"Marvellous Party\" and \"The Party's Over Now \".<ref name=ncsongs/>\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, Coward wrote his last original revue. He recalled \"I had thought of a good title, ''Sigh No More'', which later, I regret to say, turned out to be the best part of the revue\".<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2004), p. 91</ref> It was a moderate success with 213 performances in 1945\u201346.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, p. 378</ref> Among the best-known songs from the show are \"I Wonder What Happened to Him?\", \"Matelot\" and \"Nina\".<ref name=ncsongs/> Towards the end of his life Coward was consulted about, but did not compile, two 1972 revues that were anthologies of his songs from the 1920s to the 1960s, ''Cowardy Custard'' in London (the title was chosen by Coward) and ''Oh, Coward!'' in New York, at the premiere of which he made his last public appearance.<ref>Lesley, pp. 469 and 471</ref>\n\n===Songs===\nCoward wrote three hundred songs. The No\u00ebl Coward Society's website, drawing on performing statistics from the publishers and the [[PRS for Music|Performing Rights Society]], names \"[[Mad About the Boy]]\" (from ''Words and Music'') as Coward's most popular song, followed, in order, by:\n\n* \"[[I'll See You Again]]\" (''Bitter Sweet'')\n* \"[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]\" (''Words and Music'')\n* \"[[If Love Were All]]\" (''Bitter Sweet'')\n* \"Someday I'll Find You\" (''Private Lives'')\n* \"I'll Follow My Secret Heart\" (''Conversation Piece'')\n* \"[[London Pride (song)|London Pride]]\" (1941)\n* \"A Room With a View\" (''This Year of Grace'')\n* \"Mrs Worthington\" (1934)\n* \"Poor Little Rich Girl\" (''On with the Dance'')\n* \"The Stately Homes of England\" (''Operette'')<ref name=ncsongs/>\n\nCoward was no fan of the works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]],{{#tag:ref|\"I went to ''[[Iolanthe]]''... beautifully done and the music lovely but dated. It's no use, I ''hate'' Gilbert and Sullivan\".<ref>Day, p. 125</ref>|group= n}} but as a songwriter was nevertheless strongly influenced by them. He recalled: \"I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them{{space}}... my aunts and uncles, who were legion, sang them singly and in unison at the slightest provocation.\"<ref>Programme note for ''[[Cowardy Custard]]'' (1972) quoting ''The No\u00ebl Coward Song Book''</ref> His colleague Terence Rattigan wrote that as a lyricist Coward was \"the best of his kind since [[W.

Measuring approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide, Hart Island is part of the [[Pelham Islands]] archipelago, to the east of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]].\n\nThe island's first public use was as a training ground for the [[United States Colored Troops]] in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a [[American Civil War prison camps|Union Civil War prison camp]], a [[psychiatric institution]], a [[tuberculosis sanatorium]], a [[potter's field]] with mass burials, a homeless shelter, a boys' [[reformatory]], a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], [[Nike missile|Nike defense missiles]] were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967, and the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The island now serves as the city's potter's field, run by the [[New York City Department of Correction]] until 2019, when the [[New York City Council]] voted to transfer jurisdiction to the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\nThe remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island, though since the first decade of the 21st century, there are fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals; the homeless and the indigent; and mass burials of disease victims, including those who died from [[AIDS]. There is no confirmation that victims of COVID-19 have been buried there. \n\nAccess to the island is restricted by the Department of Correction, which operates an infrequent ferryboat service and imposes strict visitation quotas. Burials are conducted by inmates at the [[Rikers Island]] jail. The Hart Island Project, a public charity founded by visual artist Melinda Hunt, has tried to improve access to the island and make burial records more easily available. Prior to 2019, several laws to transfer jurisdiction to the Parks Department had been proposed to ease public access to Hart Island.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are numerous theories about the possible origins for the island's name. In one, British [[Cartographers#18th century|cartographers]] named it \"Heart Island\" in 1775 due to its organ-like shape but the 'e' was dropped shortly after.<ref name=\"fascinates\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/27/nyregion/an-island-of-the-dead-fascinates-the-living.html|title=An Island Of the Dead Fascinates The Living|last=Santora|first=Marc|date=January 27, 2003|work=The New York Times|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|access-date=April 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111023538/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/27/nyregion/an-island-of-the-dead-fascinates-the-living.html|archive-date=November 11, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|75}} A map drawn in 1777 and subsequent maps refer to the island as \"Hart Island\".<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|75}} Other names given to the island during the late 18th century were \"Little Minneford Island\" and \"Spectacle Island\", the latter because the island's shape was thought to resemble [[Glasses|spectacles]].<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|75}}\n\nAnother theory, based on the meaning of the English word \"[[Hart (deer)|hart]]\", which means \"stag\", is that the island was named when it was used as a game preserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=11613|title=The Islands of Pelham Bay|publisher=[[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]|access-date=November 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309172413/http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=11613|archive-date=March 9, 2005|url-status=live}}</ref> Another version holds that it was named in reference to deer that migrated from the mainland during periods when ice covered that part of Long Island Sound.<ref name=\"hunt\">{{cite book | last=Hunt | first=Melinda | title=Hart Island | publisher=Scalo | year=1998 | isbn=978-3-931141-90-5 | oclc=40373838 |first2=Joel |last2=Sternfeld }}</ref>{{rp|19}}<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRjMPZW4heMC|title=The Other Islands of New York City: A History and Guide (Third Edition)|last=Seitz|first=Sharon|last2=Miller|first2=Stuart|year=2011|publisher=The Countryman Press|isbn=978-1-58157-886-7|location=|pages=138\u2013144|language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|140}}\n\n== Geography ==\nHart Island is approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide at its widest point.

Measuring approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide, Hart Island is part of the [[Pelham Islands]] archipelago, to the east of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]].\n\nThe island's first public use was as a training ground for the [[United States Colored Troops]] in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a [[American Civil War prison camps|Union Civil War prison camp]], a [[psychiatric institution]], a [[tuberculosis sanatorium]], a [[potter's field]] with mass burials, a homeless shelter, a boys' [[reformatory]], a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], [[Nike missile|Nike defense missiles]] were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967, and the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The island now serves as the city's potter's field, run by the [[New York City Department of Correction]] until 2019, when the [[New York City Council]] voted to transfer jurisdiction to the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\nThe remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island, though since the first decade of the 21st century, there are fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals; the homeless and the indigent; and mass burials of disease victims, including those who died from [[AIDS]] and [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]]. \n\nAccess to the island is restricted by the Department of Correction, which operates an infrequent ferryboat service and imposes strict visitation quotas.

As long as this scheme remained dominant, the protozoa were understood to be animals and studied in departments of Zoology, while photosynthetic microorganisms and microscopic fungi\u2014the so-called Protophyta\u2014were assigned to the Plants, and studied in departments of Botany.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |last=Taylor |first=F.

For example, the algae ''[[Euglena]]'' and ''[[Dinobryon]]'' have [[chloroplast]]s for [[photosynthesis]], but can also feed on organic matter and are [[Motility|motile]]. In 1860, [[John Hogg (biologist)|John Hogg]] argued against the use of \"protozoa\", on the grounds that \"naturalists are divided in opinion\u2014and probably some will ever continue so\u2014whether many of these organisms, or living beings, are animals or plants.\"<ref name=\"Hogg\" /> As an alternative, he proposed a new kingdom called Primigenum, consisting of both the protozoa and unicellular algae (protophyta), which he combined together under the name \"Protoctista\". In Hoggs's conception, the animal and plant kingdoms were likened to two great \"pyramids\" blending at their bases in the Kingdom Primigenum.\n\nSix years later, [[Ernst Haeckel]] also proposed a third kingdom of life, which he named [[Protista]]. At first, Haeckel included a few multicellular organisms in this kingdom, but in later work he restricted the Protista to single-celled organisms, or simple colonies whose individual cells are not differentiated into different kinds of [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].\n\nDespite these proposals, Protozoa emerged as the preferred taxonomic placement for [[Heterotrophic nutrition|heterotrophic]] microorganisms such as amoebae and ciliates, and remained so for more than a century. In the course of the 20th century, however, the old \"two kingdom\" system began to weaken, with the growing awareness that fungi did not belong among the plants, and that most of the unicellular protozoa were no more closely related to the animals than they were to the plants. By mid-century, some biologists, such as [[Herbert Copeland]], [[Robert H. Whittaker]] and [[Lynn Margulis]], advocated the revival of Haeckel's Protista or Hogg's Protoctista as a kingdom-level eukaryotic group, alongside Plants, Animals and Fungi.<ref name=\":0\" /> A variety of [[Kingdom (biology)|multi-kingdom systems]] were proposed, and Kingdoms Protista and Protoctista became well established in biology texts and curricula.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Whittaker |first=R.

For instance, the malaria parasite ''[[Plasmodium]]'' feeds by [[pinocytosis]] during its immature [[Apicomplexan life cycle|trophozoite]] stage of life (ring phase), but develops a dedicated feeding [[organelle]] (cytostome) as it matures within a host's red blood cell.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tulane.edu/~wiser/malaria/fv.html |title=Biochemistry of Plasmodium |last=Wiser |first=Mark F. |website=The Wiser Page |access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ameba_001.jpg|thumb|''[[Paramecium bursaria]]'', a ciliate which derives some of its nutrients from algal [[endosymbiont]]s in the genus ''[[Chlorella]]'']]\n\nProtozoa may also live as [[mixotroph]]s, supplementing a heterotrophic diet with some form of [[autotroph]]y. Some protozoa form close associations with symbiotic photosynthetic algae, which live and grow within the membranes of the larger cell and provide nutrients to the host. Others practice [[kleptoplasty]], stealing [[chloroplast]]s from prey organisms and maintaining them within their own cell bodies as they continue to produce nutrients through photosynthesis. The ciliate ''[[Mesodinium rubrum]]'' retains functioning [[plastid]]s from the cryptophyte algae on which it feeds, using them to nourish themselves by autotrophy. These, in turn, may be passed along to dinoflagellates of the genus [[Dinophysis]] , which prey on ''Mesodinium rubrum'' but keep the enslaved plastids for themselves. Within Dinophysis, these plastids can continue to function for months.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Nishitani |first=Goh |last2=Nagai |first2=Satoshi |last3=Baba|first3=Katsuhisa |last4=Kiyokawa |first4=Susumu |last5=Kosaka|first5=Yuki |last6=Miyamura |first6=Kazuyoshi |last7=Nishikawa |first7=Tetsuya |last8=Sakurada |first8=Kiyonari |last9=Shinada |first9=Akiyoshi |date=May 2010 |title=High-Level Congruence of Myrionecta rubra Prey and Dinophysis Species Plastid Identities as Revealed by Genetic Analyses of Isolates from Japanese Coastal Waters |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=76|issue=9 |pages=2791\u20132798 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02566-09 |pmc=2863437 |pmid=20305031}}</ref>\n\n=== Motility ===\n\nOrganisms traditionally classified as protozoa are abundant in [[aqueous]] environments and [[soil]], occupying a range of [[trophic level]]s. The group includes [[flagellate]]s (which move with the help of whip-like structures called [[flagella]]), [[ciliate]]s (which move by using hair-like structures called [[cilia]]) and [[amoeba]]e (which move by the use of foot-like structures called [[pseudopodia]]). Some protozoa are [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]], and do not move at all.\n\n=== Pellicle ===\nUnlike plants, fungi and most types of algae, protozoans do not typically have a rigid [[cell wall]], but are usually enveloped by elastic structures of membranes that permit movement of the cell. In some protozoans, such as the ciliates and [[euglenozoa]]ns, the cell is supported by a composite membranous envelope called the \"pellicle\". The pellicle gives some shape to the cell, especially during locomotion. Pellicles of protozoan organisms vary from flexible and elastic to fairly rigid.  In [[ciliate]]s and [[Apicomplexa]], the pellicle is supported by closely packed vesicles called alveoli. In [[euglenid]]s, it is formed from [[protein]] strips arranged spirally along the length of the body. Familiar examples of protists with a pellicle are the [[euglenoids]] and the ciliate ''[[Paramecium]]''. In some protozoa, the pellicle hosts [[Epibiont|epibiotic]] bacteria that adhere to the surface by their [[Pilus#fimbriae|fimbriae]] (attachment pili).<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/protozoainbiolog00calk#page/1008/mode/2up Protozoa in biological research<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[File:Dileptus_viridis_cyst.jpg|thumb|Resting cyst of ciliated protozoan ''Dileptus viridis''.]]\n\n=== Life cycle ===\n[[File:Toxoplasmosis life cycle en.svg|thumb|Life cycle of parasitic protozoan, ''Toxoplasma gondii'']]\nSome protozoa have two-phase life cycles, alternating between proliferative stages (e.g., [[trophozoite]]s) and dormant [[Microbial cyst|cysts]]. As cysts, protozoa can survive harsh conditions, such as exposure to extreme temperatures or harmful chemicals, or long periods without access to nutrients, water, or oxygen for periods of time. Being a cyst enables parasitic species to survive outside of a host, and allows their transmission from one host to another. When protozoa are in the form of [[trophozoite]]s (Greek ''tropho'' = to nourish), they actively feed. The conversion of a trophozoite to cyst form is known as encystation, while the process of transforming back into a trophozoite is known as excystation.\n\nAll protozoans reproduce (not all) asexually by [[binary fission]] or multiple fission. Many protozoan species exchange genetic material by sexual means (typically, through [[Isogamy#Conjugation|conjugation]]); however, sexuality is generally decoupled from the process of reproduction, and does not immediately result in increased population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/life-sciences/evolutionary-biology/sex-and-death-protozoa-history-obsession|title=Sex and Death in Protozoa|website=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2015-06-09}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Origin and function of meiosis|meiotic sex]] is widespread among present day [[eukaryote]]s, it has, until recently, been unclear whether or not eukaryotes were sexual early in their evolution.  Due to recent advances in [[gene]] detection and other techniques, evidence has been found for some form of meiotic sex in an increasing number of protozoans of ancient lineage that diverged early in eukaryotic evolution.<ref>Bernstein H, Bernstein C (2013). Bernstein C, Bernstein H eds. ''Evolutionary Origin and Adaptive Function of Meiosis'. Meiosis. InTech. {{ISBN|978-953-51-1197-9}}''</ref>  (See [[Eukaryote#Reproduction|eukaryote reproduction]].)  Thus, such findings suggest that meiotic sex arose early in eukaryotic evolution. Examples of protozoan meiotic sexuality are described in the articles ''[[Amoebozoa]]'', ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', ''[[Leishmania]]'', ''[[Plasmodium falciparum biology]]'', ''[[Paramecium]]'', ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]'' and ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]''.\n\n== Classification ==\n{{Further|wikispecies:Protozoa}}Historically, the Protozoa were classified as \"unicellular animals\", as distinct from the Protophyta, single-celled photosynthetic organisms (algae) which were considered primitive plants.

Thus, the ecological role of protozoa in the transfer of bacterial and algal production to successive [[Trophic pyramid|trophic levels]] is important. As predators, they prey upon [[unicellular]] or [[filamentous algae]], [[bacteria]], and [[microfungi]].

For example, the algae ''[[Euglena]]'' and ''[[Dinobryon]]'' have [[chloroplast]]s for [[photosynthesis]], but can also feed on organic matter and are [[Motility|motile]]. In 1860, [[John Hogg (biologist)|John Hogg]] argued against the use of \"protozoa\", on the grounds that \"naturalists are divided in opinion\u2014and probably some will ever continue so\u2014whether many of these organisms, or living beings, are animals or plants.\"<ref name=\"Hogg\" /> As an alternative, he proposed a new kingdom called Primigenum, consisting of both the protozoa and unicellular algae (protophyta), which he combined together under the name \"Protoctista\". In Hoggs's conception, the animal and plant kingdoms were likened to two great \"pyramids\" blending at their bases in the Kingdom Primigenum.\n\nSix years later, [[Ernst Haeckel]] also proposed a third kingdom of life, which he named [[Protista]]. At first, Haeckel included a few multicellular organisms in this kingdom, but in later work he restricted the Protista to single-celled organisms, or simple colonies whose individual cells are not differentiated into different kinds of [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].\n\nDespite these proposals, Protozoa emerged as the preferred taxonomic placement for [[Heterotrophic nutrition|heterotrophic]] microorganisms such as amoebae and ciliates, and remained so for more than a century. In the course of the 20th century, however, the old \"two kingdom\" system began to weaken, with the growing awareness that fungi did not belong among the plants, and that most of the unicellular protozoa were no more closely related to the animals than they were to the plants. By mid-century, some biologists, such as [[Herbert Copeland]], [[Robert H. Whittaker]] and [[Lynn Margulis]], advocated the revival of Haeckel's Protista or Hogg's Protoctista as a kingdom-level eukaryotic group, alongside Plants, Animals and Fungi.<ref name=\":0\" /> A variety of [[Kingdom (biology)|multi-kingdom systems]] were proposed, and Kingdoms Protista and Protoctista became well established in biology texts and curricula.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Whittaker |first=R.

Some protozoans take in food by [[phagocytosis]], engulfing organic particles with [[pseudopodia]] (as [[amoeba]]e do), or taking in food through a specialized mouth-like aperture called a [[cytostome]]. Others take in food by [[osmotrophy]], absorbing dissolved nutrients through their [[cell membrane]]s.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParasitic protozoans use a wide variety of feeding strategies, and some may change methods of feeding in different phases of their life cycle. For instance, the malaria parasite ''[[Plasmodium]]'' feeds by [[pinocytosis]] during its immature [[Apicomplexan life cycle|trophozoite]] stage of life (ring phase), but develops a dedicated feeding [[organelle]] (cytostome) as it matures within a host's red blood cell.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tulane.edu/~wiser/malaria/fv.html |title=Biochemistry of Plasmodium |last=Wiser |first=Mark F. |website=The Wiser Page |access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ameba_001.jpg|thumb|''[[Paramecium bursaria]]'', a ciliate which derives some of its nutrients from algal [[endosymbiont]]s in the genus ''[[Chlorella]]'']]\n\nProtozoa may also live as [[mixotroph]]s, supplementing a heterotrophic diet with some form of [[autotroph]]y. Some protozoa form close associations with symbiotic photosynthetic algae, which live and grow within the membranes of the larger cell and provide nutrients to the host. Others practice [[kleptoplasty]], stealing [[chloroplast]]s from prey organisms and maintaining them within their own cell bodies as they continue to produce nutrients through photosynthesis. The ciliate ''[[Mesodinium rubrum]]'' retains functioning [[plastid]]s from the cryptophyte algae on which it feeds, using them to nourish themselves by autotrophy. These, in turn, may be passed along to dinoflagellates of the genus [[Dinophysis]] , which prey on ''Mesodinium rubrum'' but keep the enslaved plastids for themselves. Within Dinophysis, these plastids can continue to function for months.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Nishitani |first=Goh |last2=Nagai |first2=Satoshi |last3=Baba|first3=Katsuhisa |last4=Kiyokawa |first4=Susumu |last5=Kosaka|first5=Yuki |last6=Miyamura |first6=Kazuyoshi |last7=Nishikawa |first7=Tetsuya |last8=Sakurada |first8=Kiyonari |last9=Shinada |first9=Akiyoshi |date=May 2010 |title=High-Level Congruence of Myrionecta rubra Prey and Dinophysis Species Plastid Identities as Revealed by Genetic Analyses of Isolates from Japanese Coastal Waters |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=76|issue=9 |pages=2791\u20132798 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02566-09 |pmc=2863437 |pmid=20305031}}</ref>\n\n=== Motility ===\n\nOrganisms traditionally classified as protozoa are abundant in [[aqueous]] environments and [[soil]], occupying a range of [[trophic level]]s. The group includes [[flagellate]]s (which move with the help of whip-like structures called [[flagella]]), [[ciliate]]s (which move by using hair-like structures called [[cilia]]) and [[amoeba]]e (which move by the use of foot-like structures called [[pseudopodia]]). Some protozoa are [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]], and do not move at all.\n\n=== Pellicle ===\nUnlike plants, fungi and most types of algae, protozoans do not typically have a rigid [[cell wall]], but are usually enveloped by elastic structures of membranes that permit movement of the cell. In some protozoans, such as the ciliates and [[euglenozoa]]ns, the cell is supported by a composite membranous envelope called the \"pellicle\". The pellicle gives some shape to the cell, especially during locomotion. Pellicles of protozoan organisms vary from flexible and elastic to fairly rigid.  In [[ciliate]]s and [[Apicomplexa]], the pellicle is supported by closely packed vesicles called alveoli. In [[euglenid]]s, it is formed from [[protein]] strips arranged spirally along the length of the body. Familiar examples of protists with a pellicle are the [[euglenoids]] and the ciliate ''[[Paramecium]]''. In some protozoa, the pellicle hosts [[Epibiont|epibiotic]] bacteria that adhere to the surface by their [[Pilus#fimbriae|fimbriae]] (attachment pili).<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/protozoainbiolog00calk#page/1008/mode/2up Protozoa in biological research<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[File:Dileptus_viridis_cyst.jpg|thumb|Resting cyst of ciliated protozoan ''Dileptus viridis''.]]\n\n=== Life cycle ===\n[[File:Toxoplasmosis life cycle en.svg|thumb|Life cycle of parasitic protozoan, ''Toxoplasma gondii'']]\nSome protozoa have two-phase life cycles, alternating between proliferative stages (e.g., [[trophozoite]]s) and dormant [[Microbial cyst|cysts]]. As cysts, protozoa can survive harsh conditions, such as exposure to extreme temperatures or harmful chemicals, or long periods without access to nutrients, water, or oxygen for periods of time. Being a cyst enables parasitic species to survive outside of a host, and allows their transmission from one host to another. When protozoa are in the form of [[trophozoite]]s (Greek ''tropho'' = to nourish), they actively feed. The conversion of a trophozoite to cyst form is known as encystation, while the process of transforming back into a trophozoite is known as excystation.\n\nAll protozoans reproduce (not all) asexually by [[binary fission]] or multiple fission. Many protozoan species exchange genetic material by sexual means (typically, through [[Isogamy#Conjugation|conjugation]]); however, sexuality is generally decoupled from the process of reproduction, and does not immediately result in increased population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/life-sciences/evolutionary-biology/sex-and-death-protozoa-history-obsession|title=Sex and Death in Protozoa|website=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2015-06-09}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Origin and function of meiosis|meiotic sex]] is widespread among present day [[eukaryote]]s, it has, until recently, been unclear whether or not eukaryotes were sexual early in their evolution.  Due to recent advances in [[gene]] detection and other techniques, evidence has been found for some form of meiotic sex in an increasing number of protozoans of ancient lineage that diverged early in eukaryotic evolution.<ref>Bernstein H, Bernstein C (2013). Bernstein C, Bernstein H eds. ''Evolutionary Origin and Adaptive Function of Meiosis'. Meiosis. InTech. {{ISBN|978-953-51-1197-9}}''</ref>  (See [[Eukaryote#Reproduction|eukaryote reproduction]].)  Thus, such findings suggest that meiotic sex arose early in eukaryotic evolution. Examples of protozoan meiotic sexuality are described in the articles ''[[Amoebozoa]]'', ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', ''[[Leishmania]]'', ''[[Plasmodium falciparum biology]]'', ''[[Paramecium]]'', ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]'' and ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]''.\n\n== Classification ==\n{{Further|wikispecies:Protozoa}}Historically, the Protozoa were classified as \"unicellular animals\", as distinct from the Protophyta, single-celled photosynthetic organisms (algae) which were considered primitive plants.

The wave of spiritual revolution started creating positive ripples in the society.\n\nBarring a few, the members of Thiyya Community in Malabar have been far removed from their spiritual maturity originally based on ancient [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] traditions, and were indulging in worship of ''prakritik'' deities and  ''[[Tamas (philosophy)|tamasic]]'' practices like animal sacrifice etc. However,  during the last part of British Raj, community members started gaining modern education, especially with the help of Missionary run Educational Institutions and slowly but surely started their ascendancy towards social and cultural prominence.

After efforts of many days, finally he managed to reach a house in \"Anju Thengu\" where Guru Devan was staying. Next day he was able to have a discussion with Guru Devan at ''[[Sivagiri, Kerala|Shivagiri]]''. He requested Guru Devan to consecrate a temple in [[Malabar region|Malabar]], like those he had done in South Kerala, for the spiritual uplifting of Thiyya Community in Kannur. However Guru Devan asked him why such a temple is required in the land which is ruled by the Queen of England directly, with a lot of community members were highly educated, socially prominent and active in [[Arya Samaj]] and Vedanta Societies. Mr Kannan was able to convince Guru Devan that despite these, a large number of population are still following tamasic rites, and no one is guiding them to the right path. Finally, Guru Devan agreed to visit Kannur, in near future. Mr. Kannan came to Kannur and started working towards the aim with other prominent community members like Madhavan Master, Choyi Butler, Manikkoth Govindan Bhagavathar, Karyan Govindan Gurukkal, Chamakkali Kannan, Poovadan Krishnan, Chandroth Ananthan Mesthri, Oyatti Krishnan Vakil etc. They created an executive committee with Choyi Butler as president and Chamakkali Kannan as Secretary.\n\nTrue to his promise, Guru Devan visited Kannur in 1907 and stayed at the home of Kottiyath Choyi. The matter of temple building was discussed again, and before return of Guru Devan, a committee was formed with Cheruvari Karunakaran Tahasildar as president and Chamakkali Kannan as secretary. In a meeting held on 16 February 1908, Sree Bhagaval Bhakti Pradeepa Yogam was formally established. This organisation was renamed as [[Sree Bhakti Samvardhinini Yogam]] in 1913. In 1908, Guru Devan agin visited Kannur on invitation of Chamakkali Kannan and Kombra Kannan Master.\n\nOn his visit to see the proposed sites for the temple, when Guru Devan reached the proposed site in Talap, he said this is the ideal place and is a Temple Ground. Later during construction, remnants of an ancient temple was unearthed from this site. After selfless efforts by these noble souls, overcoming  a host of hurdles including financial problems, finally the temple was constructed, and consecrated  by Sree Narayana Guru Devan at a muhoortham between 3 AM and 3:20 AM on 11 April 1916, during the ascendancy of  [[Pushya|Pooyam (Pushya) star]].\n\nSubsequently, Guru Devan's  statue was consecrated in 1938 along with the Dwajastambam (flag pole) and Deepastambam (lamp post). The consecration of the Balikkappura (bali platform) was done in 1939, the Gajamandapam (elephant hall) in 1943 and the temple pond in 1946.\n\n== Festival ==\nThe main annual festival celebration spanning eight days,  of this temple is held in the Malayalam month [[Meenam]], starting from Pooyam Nakshatram.

Aarat procession begins from the temple at 4PM on the last day of the festival, Arat is conducted at Payyambalam Beach. Govt declares leave for all offices from 4 PM onward on this day. \n\n==See also==\n*[[Sree Bhakti Samvardhinini Yogam]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Centenary Memorial Book (Malayalam Edition) Published by Sree Sundareswara Temple in 2016.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/19928/9/09_chapter%204.pdf Baby Sujatha, V M. \"Religious Philosophy of Sree Narayana Guru,\" Thesis.

The play is set during the period of the [[Third Crusade]].\n\nOriginally conceived by Tim Rice during his collaboration with [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], the project was originally titled \"Come Back, Richard, Your Country Needs You\" and a single of the same title was recorded in 1969. The project was shelved until Rice met Stephen Oliver in the 1970s, and the pair began working on a musical centering on [[King Richard I]] of England; as it developed, the project shifted its focus to a minstrel in the King's court, vying for pop-stardom, and his 'progressive' girlfriend.\n\nThough the musical is largely a comic romp, it does tackle some serious issues.  Historically, Blondel lays out the basic goings-on of the Third Crusade as told through the eyes of the English political environment. Although the musical frequently mentions the Crusade, it is never actually shown, excepting Richard's imprisonment in Austria upon his return trip. The play also deals with one of the many assassination attempts made on Richard, and an attempt by [[King John of England|Prince John]] to steal the throne of England from his brother. As the Monks say at the end of Act One, 'Who said this piece wasn't educational?'\n\n''Blondel'' opened in London on 2 November 1983 and played in two different theatres in the West End, eventually closing after less than two years. After more than twenty years away from a professional London stage, it returned at the [[Pleasance]] Theatre in [[Islington]]. The new production starred [[Abi Finley]], semi finalist of the hit [[BBC1]] show ''[[How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?]]'', and Chris Grierson, a regular from the teen soap, ''[[Hollyoaks]]''. Produced by [[Pete Shaw (author)|Pete Shaw]], and directed by [[Patrick Wilde]], the revived version of ''Blondel'' appeared for a limited season of six weeks.\n\nRice continued to develop the script and has recently created a new version of the show.  This re-worked version (now titled ''Lute!'') was scheduled to have its world premiere at the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] Dinner Theater and run from 27 January 2012 until 12 February 2012.<ref>El Paso Times, \"Tim Rice, of 'The Lion King' fame, will be in El Paso next week\" [http://www.elpasotimes.com/entertainment/ci_19689568]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAlthough many productions have been staged worldwide, ''Blondel'' has never appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n;Act I\nThe opening words of the musical (above) as sung by a group of Monks explain the situation (\"Monks' Introduction\"). Blondel is an unappreciated musician trying to make his big break by writing a song for the King, Richard the Lionheart.  Fiona, his girlfriend, feels that it's a waste of time to write for the King as the monarchy can't possibly be around for much longer.  Even though she does enjoy the tune, she suggests he get a real job to help support her.  Blondel explains that he can't.  He says that he \"nearly hit big with 'Send in the Jesters'\" and feels a breakthrough coming and to give up now would be impossible.  Fiona leaves Blondel and decides to take her well-being into her own hands. (\"Blondel and Fiona/I'm a Monarchist\")\n\nThe Monks open the Ministry of Feudal Affairs (\"incorporating the Departments of Unemployment, the Environment, Social Security, and Gratuitous Executions\"), which is \"presided over by HRH Prince John\" at which Fiona promptly shows to ask for her freedom.  Unwilling and unable to pay the fee, Fiona is first denied her request by Prince John and later denied it by the King who explains that \"running this joint's not as cheap as it looks\".  Fiona is swept aside in order for the King to announce that he will be embarking on the Crusade and that John will be in charge while the King is away.  Fiona is enraged by this notion as it will expend more money to go on the Crusade than it would to grant her freedom and she leaves the court. (\"The Ministry of Feudal Affairs\")  Fiona and Blondel soon find themselves together again.  He manages to convince her that his song for the King will grant them all their wishes and she agrees to help him. (\"The Least of My Troubles\")\n\n\"Thus reunited, what a touching scene\" the Monks proclaim as Fiona and Blondel set off to meet the King at Dover before he embarks on his journey.  Once there Blondel is unable to present his song to Richard as the King is anxious to leave and doesn't have time for such things.  Richard suggests Blondel should take it up with John instead and the Crusaders leave for the Holy Land. (\"Lionheart\")  Back at the Ministry of Feudal Affairs, Blondel and Fiona present the song to John who promptly throws the song away and proclaims that all songs should from now on be dedicated to him and not Richard. (\"No Rhyme for Richard\")  John then tasks Blondel to write a song about him but Blondel refuses, saying it's an important job but that his heart's just not in it.  Fiona is outraged by Blondel's [[refusal of work]] saying that this is the break he's been waiting for.  As Blondel lists his reasons for not wanting to write a song dedicated to his Prince, both John and Fiona grow increasingly angered.  The scene culminates in John banishing Blondel to the Continent and declaring \"snub a prince but realize you've sunk a singing career\". (\"Trio\")\n\nPromptly realizing he's made a mistake by sending Blondel after Richard, John's mood becomes depressed.  A mysterious man appears by John's side and offers to take care of the problem for him, for a price, but misidentifies the target as Blondel and can't identify the real target, the King, at all.\n\nOnce all is set straight, the Assassin sets off on Richard's trail. (\"Assassin's Song\")  The act closes with Fiona, realizing that Blondel doesn't love her as much as he loves his music and that she'll never get the kind of social change she wants.  Even through her realizations, Fiona decides to chase after Blondel, unsure of what she's actually looking for. (\"Running Back for More\")\n\n;Act II\nAct Two opens on the Continent, Blondel in hot pursuit of King Richard.  Blondel journeys through France, Spain, and Italy wowing crowds of natives with his music and searching high and low for his King (\"Have you seen my King?\" \"NO!\") but to no avail.  As the trek continues, Blondel begins to lose hope that he'll ever find Richard.  Meanwhile, the Assassin chases after Blondel, his patience with the troubadour's music thinning.  At the point of giving up on the chase, Blondel runs into Fiona who tells him that Richard is being held prisoner in Austria by Duke Leopold and the pair take off to find the King together. (\"Blondel in Europe\")\n\nWhile sitting in prison, Richard laments about his situation and longs for the days of the Crusade when he was free to do as he pleased.  Back in London, John, pleased with his own cleverness and handiwork, prepares himself for becoming King of England. (\"Saladin Days/I Can't Wait to be King\")  Arriving in Salzburg, the pursuers come to rest in an inn just before completing the last leg of the journey to the King's cell.  The Assassin admits that he's becoming extremely discouraged by the whole situation and that the \"job is killing me\".  Blondel, on the other hand, has a renewed sense of ambition and refuses to give up declaring that the King will soon be found.  Fiona suggests that lingering would not behoove anyone at this point and they should press on before time has run out though she is still unsure whether or not she really wants to help. The Assassin decides that he'd \"rather murder Prince John\" but will soldier on while John announces that Richard has died on his Crusade and that he will be assuming the throne of England. (\"The Inn at Salzburg/Blondel's Search\")\n\nHaving found the King in his prison, Fiona decides to speak with the Duke of Austria about letting Richard go and the Assassin nears his victim, poised for the murder.  The Duke dictates a letter to Prince John, demanding a million-crown ransom.  Fiona sweet-talks and flatters the Duke in order to get him to release Richard, which the Duke agrees to. (\"The Duke of Austria's Quarter\")  Ready to give up the search, Blondel, quite by accident, runs into Richard.  With Richard now released, the Duke's English visitors make their way out of the castle but just as they're about to walk out the door, the Duke has a sudden change of heart and decides that he's not going to let them go after all.  The Duke will only let Blondel and Richard go if Fiona will stay with him in Austria.  Unwilling to stay with Leopold, Fiona tricks him into walking outside toward someone she says is better-suited for him at which point the Assassin, seeing the crown on the Duke's head, attacks, killing him.  Richard, Blondel, and Fiona declare it to be \"a most important day\" and decide it's time to go back to England.  However, before they leave, Fiona demands a pardon and her freedom from the King in exchange for keeping her mouth shut about the monarchy to which the King agrees reluctantly.  Meanwhile, the Assassin, having killed the wrong man, laments about his \"first failure\" and wonders if he can make a comeback.  However he goes on to discover that he didn't even really kill the Duke (\"Leopold is a-okay\") and the two men find comfort in the other's mistakes. (\"The Cell\")\n\nBlondel, Fiona, and Richard make their way back to England where John is proceeding with his plans to become King.  Having declared Richard dead, John impatiently awaits his coronation.  At the moment before the crown is placed on John's head, Richard bursts through the doors and puts a swift end to the illegal ceremony. (\"Westminster Abbey\")  Having stopped his brother's coronation, Richard declares Blondel the \"country's foremost composer\" and at last allows him to perform his song.  With the help of the Blondettes, Blondel becomes the pop sensation he'd been waiting to become. (\"I'm a Monarchist (Reprise)\")  Having been absolved their indiscretions and declared friends and heroes of the monarchy, Blondel and Fiona renew their relationship and declare their love for each other. (\"Running Back for More (Reprise)\")\n\n==Production history==\n\n===The London Stage===\n[[Image:Blondel-2006-Rehearsals.jpg|frame|Tim Rice and Patrick Wilde (Matt Harrop in foreground) at rehearsals for London revival of Blondel]]Blondel opened in Bath on 12 September 1983 and soon moved to Manchester where it stayed for two weeks before moving to the newly refurbished Old Vic on 2 November.

The play is set during the period of the [[Third Crusade]].\n\nOriginally conceived by Tim Rice during his collaboration with [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], the project was originally titled \"Come Back, Richard, Your Country Needs You\" and a single of the same title was recorded in 1969. The project was shelved until Rice met Stephen Oliver in the 1970s, and the pair began working on a musical centering on [[King Richard I]] of England; as it developed, the project shifted its focus to a minstrel in the King's court, vying for pop-stardom, and his 'progressive' girlfriend.\n\nThough the musical is largely a comic romp, it does tackle some serious issues.  Historically, Blondel lays out the basic goings-on of the Third Crusade as told through the eyes of the English political environment. Although the musical frequently mentions the Crusade, it is never actually shown, excepting Richard's imprisonment in Austria upon his return trip. The play also deals with one of the many assassination attempts made on Richard, and an attempt by [[King John of England|Prince John]] to the steal the throne of England from his brother. As the Monks say at the end of Act One, 'Who said this piece wasn't educational?'\n\n''Blondel'' opened in London on 2 November 1983 and played in two different theatres in the West End, eventually closing after less than two years. After more than twenty years away from a professional London stage, it returned at the [[Pleasance]] Theatre in [[Islington]]. The new production starred [[Abi Finley]], semi finalist of the hit [[BBC1]] show ''[[How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?]]'', and Chris Grierson, a regular from the teen soap, ''[[Hollyoaks]]''. Produced by [[Pete Shaw (author)|Pete Shaw]], and directed by [[Patrick Wilde]], the revived version of ''Blondel'' appeared for a limited season of six weeks.\n\nRice continued to develop the script and has recently created a new version of the show.
