It is part of Asimov's [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]], and was the second of Asimov's [[positronic robot]] stories to see publication.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[Powell and Donovan]] are assigned to a [[space station]] [[Solar power satellite|which supplies energy via microwave beams]] to the planets. The [[robot]]s that control the energy beams are in turn co-ordinated by QT-1, known to Powell and Donovan as Cutie, an advanced model with highly developed reasoning ability.  Using these abilities, Cutie decides that space, stars and the planets beyond the station don't really exist, and that the humans that visit the station are unimportant, short-lived and expendable. QT-1 makes the lesser robots disciples of a new religion, which considers the power source of the ship to be \"Master.\" QT-1 teaches them to bow down to the \"Master\" and intone, \"[[Shahada|There is no master but Master, and QT-1 is His prophet]].\" Disregarding human commands as inferior, QT-1 asserts \"[[Cogito ergo sum|I myself, exist, because I think&nbsp;-]]\". The sardonic response of the humans is, \"Oh, Jupiter, a robot [[Descartes]]!\"\n\nThe humans initially attempt to reason with QT-1, until they realize that they can't convince it otherwise.  Their attempts to remove Cutie physically also fail, as the other robots have become disciples and refuse to obey human orders.  The situation seems desperate, as a solar storm is expected, potentially deflecting the energy beam, incinerating populated areas.  When the storm hits, Powell and Donovan are amazed to find that the beam operates perfectly.\n\nCutie, however, does not believe they did anything other than maintain meter readings at optimum, according to the commands of The Master.  As far as Cutie and the rest of the robots are concerned, solar storms and planets are non-existent. The two thus come to the realization that, although the robots themselves were consciously unaware of doing so, they'd been following the First and Second Laws all along. Cutie knew, on some level, that it'd be more suited to operating the controls than Powell or Donavan, so, lest it endanger humans and break the First Law by obeying their orders, it subconsciously orchestrated a scenario where it would be in control of the beam. \n\nPowell and Donovan realize that there is no need to do anything for the rest of their tour of duty.  Cutie's religion cannot be eliminated, but since the robot performs its job just as well, it is moot, even if Cutie continues to perform his duties for a perceived deity, rather than for the benefit of the humans.  The humans begin to consider how they might spread the notion to other groups of robots which need to work as teams.\n\n==Notes==\nAsimov wrote \"Reason\" in October and November 1940. [[John W.

Cutie knew, on some level, that it'd be more suited to operating the controls than Powell or Donavan, so, lest it endanger humans and break the First Law by obeying their orders, it subconsciously orchestrated a scenario where it would be in control of the beam. \n\nPowell and Donovan realize that there is no need to do anything for the rest of their tour of duty.  Cutie's religion cannot be eliminated, but since the robot performs its job just as well, it is moot, even if Cutie continues to perform his duties for a perceived deity, rather than for the benefit of the humans.  The humans begin to consider how they might spread the notion to other groups of robots which need to work as teams.\n\n==Notes==\nAsimov wrote \"Reason\" in October and November 1940. [[John W.

The goal of establishing IASBS was to provide a leading research-based institute in advanced science topics for both researchers and students in Iran.\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe '''Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences''' ('''IASBS''') ([[Persian language|Persian]]: \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u062a\u062d\u0635\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062a \u062a\u06a9\u0645\u06cc\u0644\u06cc \u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u067e\u0627\u06cc\u0647 \u0632\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0646) ('''Zanjan Graduate University of Basic Sciences''') is an advanced research center and graduate-level degree-granting institute in [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjan]], [[Iran]]. It was founded in 1991 by Prof. [[Yousef Sobouti]], who was the director of the institute until 2010. After that Dr.Rasoul Khodabakhsh was the director till February 2014, and Dr. HamidReza Mohammadi Khalesifard filled the position then. Now Prof. Babak Karimi is the president of the Institute.\nThe goal of establishing '''IASBS''' was to provide a leading research-based institute in advanced science topics for both researchers and students in Iran.\n\n== Campus ==\nZanjan, a city with a population of 300,000 in [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] region, 350&nbsp;km to the north-west of Tehran, was chosen for the Institute. The location was far enough from Tehran to not be affected by the distractions of the city but close enough to pursue the many ensuing official and budgetary problems in Tehran. \nThe main campus of the university is located close to Zanjan University of Medical Sciences in Gavazang area, Zanjan, Iran. IASBS campus has a unique design and architecture. It is widely credited to be a Green campus with plants and greeneries being part of the campus design, even in classes and buildings. Moreover, IASBS is one of the few universities in Iran benefiting from solar energy solutions\n\n=== Buildings ===\n* Faculty of Physics\n* Faculty of Chemistry\n* Faculty of Mathematics\n* Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology\n* Faculty of Earth Sciences\n* Faculty of Biological Sciences\n* Torkaman Library\n* House of Science\n* Science and Technology Park (Zanjan Techno-Center)\n* University Dining Hall\n* Gym (I and II)\n* Mosque\n* Dormitories\n\n== Departments and Programs ==\n\n=== Programs ===\nIASBS was established as a graduate-level degree-granting institution. Now it offers graduate and postgraduate degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Geophysics, Biophysics, Biochemistry and Chemistry. Since September 2000, however, it has started a program in physics for a group of distinguished high school graduates. The program, a first attempt at the national level, will train these select group of students over a period of seven years, granting them a Ph.D. degree in physics. IASBS also offers a bachelor of science degree in computer engineering which is the only undergraduate program in the institute. The institute also used to run a joint undergraduate program in [[Information Technology]] with [[Heriot-Watt University]] of the United Kingdom.\n\n=== Departments and Research Centers ===\n* Department of Physics\n* Department of Chemistry\n* Department of Mathematics\n* Department of Computer Science and Information Technology\n* Department of Earth Sciences\n* Department of Biological Sciences\n* Center for Research in Climate Change and Global Warming\n* Research Center for Basic Sciences and Modern Technologies (RBST) \n* Language Teaching and Research Section\n\n== Awards and Rankings ==\n\n* Ranked 2nd in Iran by Iran Science Elites Federation (2016) <ref>https://www.mehrnews.com/news/3931492/%D8%B1%D8%AA%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%AE%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C-%DA%A9%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%88%D9%85-%D9%BE%D8%B2%D8%B4%DA%A9%DB%8C-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86</ref>\n* Announced as the center of excellence in [[physics]] by [[Iran Ministry of Science, Research and Technology]]\n* Awarded by Islamic Development Bank in science and technology\n\n[[SCImago Institutions Rankings]]:<ref>https://www.scimagoir.com/institution.php?idp=26482</ref>\n* '''2017''' World Ranking: 612 \n* '''2016''' World Ranking: 620\n* '''2015''' World Ranking: 617\n\n== The International Advisory Council ==\nThe International Advisory Council of the Institute is composed of a host of scholars and scientists.

The community is known for a long beach stretching approximately {{convert|2.1|mi}} and roughly {{convert|450|ft}} wide. The climate is unusually moderate because of Manhattan Beach's proximity to the Pacific Ocean, with an average year-round high temperature of {{convert|69.1|F}} and an average year-round low of {{convert|56.4|F}}.\n\nIts schools are run independently of Los Angeles Unified School District with a separate school board based in Manhattan Beach.

Manhattan Beach is known for having less traffic congestion than other parts of Los Angeles, along with many fine dining options, and a casual beach culture. According to a March 6, 2020 article in several newspapers (including the Orange County Register) the City of Manhattan Beach California was ranked as the \"Best City\" to live in the United States. The study ranking Manhattan Beach as the nation's top City was conducted by Wall St./24/7 a news and survey organization. \n\n==History==\nThe sandy coastal landscape of what is now Manhattan Beach was likely inhabited by the [[Tongva]] tribe of Native Americans. Evidence of inhabitants have been noted in the nearby [[Chowigna]] excavation as far back as 7100 years ago. The Tongva Village of Ongoovanga was located near Redondo Beach according to an LA times article.{{cn|date=February 2020}} It has been mentioned at the Historical Society that the location of a portion of current day Manhattan Beach may have been used as a Native American burial grounds. \n\nIn the mid-18th century, the [[Portol\u00e0 expedition]] was the first European land exploration of present-day California. It traveled north from San Diego to the San Gabriel Valley, Los Angeles Basin, San Fernando Valley, Monterey Bay, and San Francisco Bay. In 1784, [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Dom\u00ednguez]], who was a soldier in that expedition received a land grant grazing concession named [[Rancho San Pedro]], 75,000 acres (300 km2) of land and one of the first in California, by the upper Las Californias military Governor Pedro Fages on behalf of [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]] of Spain. It included what is today the entire Port of Los Angeles; San Pedro, Los Angeles; Harbor City, Los Angeles; Wilmington, Los Angeles; Carson; Compton; the Dominguez Hills; Lomita; the Palos Verdes Peninsula; Redondo Beach; Hermosa Beach; Manhattan Beach; and Torrance.\n\nIn 1863, a Scottish immigrant, Sir Robert Burnett, purchased [[Rancho Sausal Redondo]] and [[Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela]] from [[Cornelio Avila#Antonio Ygnacio Avila|Avila]]'s heirs for $33,000. Ten years later in 1873, Burnett leased the ranch to a Canadian, Daniel Freeman (not the American [[Daniel Freeman]], who was the first to file a claim under the [[Homestead Act]] of 1862). Burnett returned to Scotland. Freeman moved his wife and three children onto the ranch and started growing various crops. On May 4, 1885, Freeman bought the ranch from Burnett for $140,000. At some point after this the location was informally called \"Shore Acres.\"\n\n[[George H. Peck (1856-1940)|George H. Peck]] owned a lot of the land that became part of the north section of Manhattan Beach. A coin flip decided the town's name. Around 1902, the beach suburb was named \"Manhattan\" after developer Stewart Merrill's home, the [[New York City]] borough of [[Manhattan]]. \"Beach\" was appended to the city's name in 1927 at the behest of the postmaster.<ref>{{cite web|title=Capsule History of Manhattan Beach, 1912 - 1975|author=Judson Grenier|url=http://manhattanbeachhistorical.org/history/|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[McMartin preschool trial]]s, allegedly an example of [[day care sex abuse hysteria]], started with investigations of a Manhattan Beach preschool in 1983.

Manhattan Beach features {{convert|2.1|mi|km}} of ocean frontage.\n\n===Beach and sand dunes===\nManhattan Beach is a hotspot for beach volleyball and surfing.\n\nA majority of the land in Manhattan Beach was once exposed sand dunes which now lie beneath the city's buildings and streets. The underlying dunes afford residents ocean views throughout western portions of the city. The tallest hill is 244 feet high and located in the city's southwest region. The only remaining exposed sand dune is at [[Sand Dune Park]], where sand resembling the original landscape can also be found. In the late 1920s, Manhattan Beach excess sand was purchased by Hawai{{okina}}ian developers, who negotiated a deal with the Kuhn Brothers Construction Company to ship the sand across the [[Pacific Ocean]] from Manhattan Beach via Los Angeles Harbor to [[Waikiki Beach]] over a 10-year period.\n\nThe beach is approximately 400 feet wide and 2.1 miles long. In the early part of the last century, the beach was narrow (approximately 150 feet) and sloping. From 1938 to 1989, it more than doubled in width when large quantities of sand were placed on beaches to the north during construction of the Hyperion Treatment Plant, Marina Del Rey, and Scattergood Power Plant. The sand was carried southward by the ocean's natural littoral flow and widened Manhattan Beach.<ref>Reppucci, George M. \"Manhattan Beach California: Width determination from a century of images\"; Shore and Beach, Vol 80, No.4, Fall 2012.</ref>\n\nEvery August, the city hosts the Manhattan Beach Open Volleyball Tournament and the International Surf Festival.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n[[File:Manhattan Beach CA Glass Strand House photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|Glass home on the \"Strand\"]]\n[[Image:Manhattan Beach houses.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the ocean in Manhattan Beach]]\n\nResidents have divided the city into several distinct neighborhoods, including the \"Strand\"  \"Sand Section\", \"Hill Section\", \"Tree Section\", \"Gas Lamp Section\", \"Manhattan Village\", \"Manhattan Heights\", \"East Manhattan Beach\" (Manhattan Village, Manhattan Heights, Liberty Village, Manhattan Knolls), The Poet's Section\" (Shelley, Tennyson, Longfellow, Keats, and \"El Porto\" (North Manhattan Beach). The Roth Tract, between Herrin and Peck, is sometimes referred to as the \"Bird Section.\"\n\nThe \"Hill Section\" is known for its high priced homes where many of the residences are remodeled or newly constructed. The steep hills allow panoramic ocean and city views.\n\nThe nearby \"Sand Section\" is notable for its quiet walk-street neighborhoods adjacent to the ocean. Oceanfront homes stretch along the bike path and walking lane of \"The Strand\". \"The Strand\" section of Manhattan Beach includes some of the most expensive real estate per square foot in the United States.<ref name=patch>{{cite web|url=https://patch.com/california/manhattanbeach/the-most-expensive-homes-in-america|author=Tony Cordi|title=The Most Expensive Homes in\u2026 America|publisher=[[Patch Media]]|date=April 1, 2010|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince 2010, new property developments in Manhattan Beach cannot exceed two lot parcels.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 35,135,<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US0645400| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Census Summary File 1 (G001), Manhattan Beach city, California| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| website=American FactFinder| accessdate=September 4, 2019| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213091005/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US0645400| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref> and in 2018 the population was estimated to be 35,532.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n\nManhattan Beach is one of the three [[Beach Cities]], others known as Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach, that make up the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] region of Los Angeles County. The community is known for a long beach stretching approximately {{convert|2.1|mi}} and roughly {{convert|450|ft}} wide. The climate is unusually moderate because of Manhattan Beach's proximity to the Pacific Ocean, with an average year-round high temperature of {{convert|69.1|F}} and an average year-round low of {{convert|56.4|F}}.\n\nIts schools are run independently of Los Angeles Unified School District with a separate school board based in Manhattan Beach. [[Mira Costa High School]] in Manhattan Beach is ranked in the top 1% of high schools nationally and has students from both Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mira Costa High School |url=http://www.miracostahigh.org/apps/news/article/487161 |website=www.miracostahigh.org |accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a May 18, 2017, PropertyShark study, the City of Manhattan Beach 90266 zip code ranked as the 32nd most expensive zip code in the United States. According to a December 2017 PropertyShark study the City of Manhattan Beach had the highest median price per square foot for residential properties ($943 per square foot) of all 88 cities in L.A. County, ahead of Malibu and Beverly Hills. The residents have a median age of 44.2 years, an average household size of 2.5, and 55.6% are married. Manhattan Beach is known for having less traffic congestion than other parts of Los Angeles, along with many fine dining options, and a casual beach culture.\n\n==History==\nThe sandy coastal landscape of what is now Manhattan Beach was likely inhabited by the [[Tongva]] tribe of Native Americans. Evidence of inhabitants have been noted in the nearby [[Chowigna]] excavation as far back as 7100 years ago. The Tongva Village of Ongoovanga was located near Redondo Beach according to an LA times article.{{cn|date=February 2020}} It has been mentioned at the Historical Society that the location of a portion of current day Manhattan Beach may have been used as a Native American burial grounds. \n\nIn the mid-18th century, the [[Portol\u00e0 expedition]] was the first European land exploration of present-day California. It traveled north from San Diego to the San Gabriel Valley, Los Angeles Basin, San Fernando Valley, Monterey Bay, and San Francisco Bay. In 1784, [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Dom\u00ednguez]], who was a soldier in that expedition received a land grant grazing concession named [[Rancho San Pedro]], 75,000 acres (300 km2) of land and one of the first in California, by the upper Las Californias military Governor Pedro Fages on behalf of [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]] of Spain. It included what is today the entire Port of Los Angeles; San Pedro, Los Angeles; Harbor City, Los Angeles; Wilmington, Los Angeles; Carson; Compton; the Dominguez Hills; Lomita; the Palos Verdes Peninsula; Redondo Beach; Hermosa Beach; Manhattan Beach; and Torrance.\n\nIn 1863, a Scottish immigrant, Sir Robert Burnett, purchased [[Rancho Sausal Redondo]] and [[Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela]] from [[Cornelio Avila#Antonio Ygnacio Avila|Avila]]'s heirs for $33,000. Ten years later in 1873, Burnett leased the ranch to a Canadian, Daniel Freeman (not the American [[Daniel Freeman]], who was the first to file a claim under the [[Homestead Act]] of 1862). Burnett returned to Scotland. Freeman moved his wife and three children onto the ranch and started growing various crops. On May 4, 1885, Freeman bought the ranch from Burnett for $140,000. At some point after this the location was informally called \"Shore Acres.\"\n\n[[George H. Peck (1856-1940)|George H. Peck]] owned a lot of the land that became part of the north section of Manhattan Beach. A coin flip decided the town's name. Around 1902, the beach suburb was named \"Manhattan\" after developer Stewart Merrill's home, the [[New York City]] borough of [[Manhattan]]. \"Beach\" was appended to the city's name in 1927 at the behest of the postmaster.<ref>{{cite web|title=Capsule History of Manhattan Beach, 1912 - 1975|author=Judson Grenier|url=http://manhattanbeachhistorical.org/history/|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[McMartin preschool trial]]s, allegedly an example of [[day care sex abuse hysteria]], started with investigations of a Manhattan Beach preschool in 1983.

During the 1920s and 1930s, Kuhn Brothers Construction Company leveled uneven sandy sites and some excess sand was sold and shipped to [[Waikiki|Waikiki, Hawaii]], to convert their reef and rock beach into a sandy beach. The sand was also used to build the Los Angeles Coliseum and portions of the Pacific Coast Highway.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n[[Image:Manhattan beach pier photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|The [[Manhattan Beach pier|Manhattan Beach Pier]] in 2013|437x437px|centre]]\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Climate===\n\n{{Weather box\n| location    = Manhattan Beach, California\n| single line = Y\n| Jan record high F = 91\n| Feb record high F = 92\n| Mar record high F = 95\n| Apr record high F = 102\n| May record high F = 97\n| Jun record high F = 104\n| Jul record high F = 97\n| Aug record high F = 98\n| Sep record high F = 110\n| Oct record high F = 106\n| Nov record high F = 101\n| Dec record high F = 94\n| year record high F = \n| Jan high F = 64.9\n| Feb high F = 63.7\n| Mar high F = 64.3\n| Apr high F = 65.9\n| May high F = 68.1\n| Jun high F = 71.3\n| Jul high F = 74.4\n| Aug high F = 75.2\n| Sep high F = 74.9\n| Oct high F = 72.8\n| Nov high F = 68.9\n| Dec high F = 65.2\n| year high F = \n| Jan low F = 49.3\n| Feb low F = 50.2\n| Mar low F = 51.9\n| Apr low F = 54.1\n| May low F = 56.7\n| Jun low F = 61.3\n| Jul low F = 64.1\n| Aug low F = 64.4\n| Sep low F = 62.9\n| Oct low F = 59.3\n| Nov low F = 53.3\n| Dec low F = 48.9\n| year low F = \n| Jan record low F = 27\n| Feb record low F = 34\n| Mar record low F = 35\n| Apr record low F = 42\n| May record low F = 45\n| Jun record low F = 48\n| Jul record low F = 52\n| Aug record low F = 51\n| Sep record low F = 47\n| Oct record low F = 43\n| Nov record low F = 38\n| Dec record low F = 32\n| year record low F = \n| Jan precipitation inch = 2.71\n| Feb precipitation inch = 3.35\n| Mar precipitation inch = 1.85\n| Apr precipitation inch = 0.7\n| May precipitation inch = 0.22\n| Jun precipitation inch = 0.08\n| Jul precipitation inch = 0.03\n| Aug precipitation inch = 0.05\n| Sep precipitation inch = 0.21\n| Oct precipitation inch = 0.56\n| Nov precipitation inch = 1.11\n| Dec precipitation inch = 2.05\n| year precipitation inch = \n| source 1 = The Weather Channel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/USCA0664:1:US|title=Monthly Averages for Manhattan Beach, California|first=|last=|website=www.weather.com|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n| date     = July 2018\n}}\n\nManhattan Beach benefits from ocean breezes that provide clean air and summer temperatures that are {{convert|10|to|20|F-change|C-change}} cooler than the inland regions of Southern California.

Manhattan Beach features {{convert|2.1|mi|km}} of ocean frontage.\n\n===Beach and sand dunes===\nManhattan Beach is a hotspot for beach volleyball and surfing.\n\nA majority of the land in Manhattan Beach was once exposed sand dunes which now lie beneath the city's buildings and streets. The underlying dunes afford residents ocean views throughout western portions of the city. The tallest hill is 244 feet high and located in the city's southwest region. The only remaining exposed sand dune is at [[Sand Dune Park]], where sand resembling the original landscape can also be found. In the late 1920s, Manhattan Beach excess sand was purchased by Hawai{{okina}}ian developers, who negotiated a deal with the Kuhn Brothers Construction Company to ship the sand across the [[Pacific Ocean]] from Manhattan Beach via Los Angeles Harbor to [[Waikiki Beach]] over a 10-year period.\n\nThe beach is approximately 400 feet wide and 2.1 miles long. In the early part of the last century, the beach was narrow (approximately 150 feet) and sloping. From 1938 to 1989, it more than doubled in width when large quantities of sand were placed on beaches to the north during construction of the Hyperion Treatment Plant, Marina Del Rey, and Scattergood Power Plant. The sand was carried southward by the ocean's natural littoral flow and widened Manhattan Beach.<ref>Reppucci, George M. \"Manhattan Beach California: Width determination from a century of images\"; Shore and Beach, Vol 80, No.4, Fall 2012.</ref>\n\nEvery August, the city hosts the Manhattan Beach Open Volleyball Tournament and the International Surf Festival.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n[[File:Manhattan Beach CA Glass Strand House photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|Glass home on the \"Strand\"]]\n[[Image:Manhattan Beach houses.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the ocean in Manhattan Beach]]\n\nResidents have divided the city into several distinct neighborhoods, including the \"Strand\"  \"Sand Section\", \"Hill Section\", \"Tree Section\", \"Gas Lamp Section\", \"Manhattan Village\", \"Manhattan Heights\", \"East Manhattan Beach\" (Manhattan Village, Manhattan Heights, Liberty Village, Manhattan Knolls), The Poet's Section\" (Shelley, Tennyson, Longfellow, Keats, and \"El Porto\" (North Manhattan Beach). The Roth Tract, between Herrin and Peck, is sometimes referred to as the \"Bird Section.\"\n\nThe \"Hill Section\" is known for its high priced homes where many of the residences are remodeled or newly constructed. The steep hills allow panoramic ocean and city views.\n\nThe nearby \"Sand Section\" is notable for its quiet walk-street neighborhoods adjacent to the ocean. Oceanfront homes stretch along the bike path and walking lane of \"The Strand\". \"The Strand\" section of Manhattan Beach includes some of the most expensive real estate per square foot in the United States.<ref name=patch>{{cite web|url=https://patch.com/california/manhattanbeach/the-most-expensive-homes-in-america|author=Tony Cordi|title=The Most Expensive Homes in\u2026 America|publisher=[[Patch Media]]|date=April 1, 2010|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince 2010, new property developments in Manhattan Beach cannot exceed two lot parcels.

The area runs along Manhattan Beach Boulevard and the streets perpendicular to the [[Manhattan Beach Pier]] and Valley Drive. There are many Zagat rated casual-fine dining restaurants, specialty boutiques and retailers that create a pedestrian friendly, mixed-use downtown center.  The Metlox site, where the [[Metlox Pottery|pottery factory]] once stood for decades, was closed in the early 1990s and redeveloped into a mixed-use center. The new Metlox site includes a luxury boutique hotel, spa, restaurants, shops and underground parking.\n\n====North Manhattan Beach District====\nNorth Manhattan Beach business district is located near the intersection of Rosecrans and Highland and has many excellent restaurants and shops.
