This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and [[parachurch organizations]].\n\nMany leadership roles in the organized church have been restricted to males. In the [[Sex, gender and the Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as [[pope]], [[patriarch]], and [[bishop]]. Women may serve as [[abbess]]es. Most mainstream [[Protestants|Protestant]] denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups are tightening their constraints in reaction. [[Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches have embraced the ordination of women since their founding.\n\nChristian traditions that officially recognize \"[[saint]]s\", as persons of exceptional holiness of life having attained the [[beatific vision]] ([[heaven]]), do list women in that group. Most prominent is [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]] who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the \"[[Theotokos]]\", i.e. \"Mother of God\", the son born of her, Jesus, being God Incarnate, that is, both God and Man. \nWomen prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, [[doctors of the church]], founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. [[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.\n\n====Islam====\n{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}\n\nAccording to Dhami and Sheikh, gender roles in Muslim countries are centered on the importance of the family unit, which is viewed as the basis of a balanced and healthy society.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dhami |first1=Sangeeta |title=The Muslim family |journal=West J Med |date=Nov 2000 |volume=173 |issue=5 |pages=352\u2013356 |pmid=11069879 |pmc=1071164 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.173.5.352 }}</ref> Islamic views on gender roles and family are traditionally conservative.\n\nMany Muslim-majority countries, most prominently Saudi Arabia, have interpretations of religious doctrine regarding gender roles embedded in their laws.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Offenhauer |first1=P. |title=Women in Islamic Societies: A selected review of social scientific literature |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Women_Islamic_Societies.pdf}}</ref> In the [[United Arab Emirates]], non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more [[modesty|modestly]], due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.\n\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. This norm may sometimes be objected to by women visiting from other countries - but they may nevertheless decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interests of their own safety. For example, in Egypt, women who do not dress \"[[modesty|modestly]]\" - whether they are Muslims or not - may be perceived to be akin to prostitutes by men.\n\n[[Muhammad]] described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith Collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:\n:<blockquote>\"A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother!'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your father'\"</blockquote>In Muslim culture, women are seen as having a similar status to men, however, men are seen as a degree above women according to the qur'an.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/2/228?translations=22,101,18,17,84,19,21,85,95,20|title=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|website=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> How gender roles are honored is largely cultural.

Despite this allowance for transgression, Hindu cultural traditions portray women in contradictory ways.

It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying.<ref name=\":1\" /> Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to their biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals. Thinking about the way in which couples act on romantic television shows or movies and the way women are portrayed as passive in magazine ads, reveals a lot about how gender roles are viewed in society and in heterosexual marriages.<ref name=\":1\"/> Traditional gendered roles view the man as a \u201cpro-creator, a protector, and a provider,\u201d and the woman as \u201cpretty and polite but not too aggressive, not too outspoken and not too smart.\u201d <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Marriage and Families: Changes, Choices, and Constrains|last=Benokraits|first=Nijole|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2002|isbn=978-0-13-034177-8|location=New Jersey|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/marriagesfamilie0004beno}}</ref> Media aids in society conforming to these traditional gendered views.

Their study into television advertising has shown that women are much more likely to be shown in a setting in the home compared to men. The study also shows that women are shown much less in work-like settings.

Advertisements for products directed towards female viewers are shown during the day on weekdays, while products for men are shown during weekends. The same article shows that a study on adults and television media has also seen that the more television adults watch, the more likely they are to believe or support the gender roles that are illustrated. The support of the presented gender stereotypes can lead to a negative view of feminism or sexual aggression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rubie-Davies|first1=Christine M.|last2=Liu|first2=Sabrina|last3=Lee|first3=Kai-Chi Katie|date=March 2013|title=Watching Each Other: Portrayals of Gender and Ethnicity in Television Advertisements|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|volume=153|issue=2|pages=179\u2013180|doi=10.1080/00224545.2012.717974|pmid=23484346}}</ref>\n\nIt has been presented in the journal article by [[Emerald Group Publishing Limited]] that adolescent girls have been effected by the stereotypical view of [[Media and gender|women in media]].

These consequences have ranged from anxiety to eating disorders. Young girls in an experiment of this journal article describe pictures on women in advertisements as unrealistic and fake. They are dressed in little and revealing clothing which sexualised the women and expose their thin figures, that are gazed upon by the public, creating an issue with stereotyping in the media.\n\nIt has also been presented that children are affected by gender roles in the media. Children's preferences in television characters are most likely to be to characters of the same gender. Because children favor characters of the same gender, the characteristics of the character are also looked to by children.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aubrey |first1=Jennifer Stevens |last2=Harrison |first2=Kristen |title=The Gender-Role Content of Children's Favorite Television Programs and Its Links to Their Gender-Related Perceptions. |journal=Media Psychology |date=May 2004 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013142 |doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0602_1}}</ref> In another journal article by Emerald Group Publishing Limited, the underrepresentation of women in children's television shows between 1930 and 1960 is examined. While studies between 1960 and 1990 show an increase in the representation of women in television, studies conducted between 1990 and 2005, a time when women were considered to be equal to men by some, show no change in the representation of women in children's television shows. Women, being underrepresented in children's television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steyer|first1=Isabella|date=2014|title=Gender representations in children's media and their influence|journal=Campus-Wide Information Systems|volume=31|issue=2/3|pages=171\u2013180|doi=10.1108/CWIS-11-2013-0065}}</ref>\n\n====Social Interaction====\nGendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex.<ref name=\":2\" /> Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different.<ref name=\":2\" /> One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.<ref>Lindsey, L. L. (2015). ''Gender roles: A sociological perspective''.

Gender roles can be defined as the behaviors, values, and attitudes that a society considers appropriate for both male and female.<ref name=\":0\"/> Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family.<ref name=\":0\"/> However, in today's society the division of roles are starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriage in order to share responsibilities. This revolutionary view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes. In today's society it is more likely that a man and woman are both providers for their family.

Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or ''instruments'') that have been translated, which potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:\n* Attitudes Towards Women Scale,\n* Sex-Role Egalitarian Scale, and\n* Sex-Role Ideology Scale.\nThrough such tests, it is known that American southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual's culture. This also may differ among compatriots whose 'cultures' are a few hundred miles apart.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = Lei | year = 1999 | title = Gender Role Egalitarian Attitudes in Beijing, Hong Kong, Florida, and Michigan | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 6| pages = 722\u201341 | doi=10.1177/0022022199030006004}}</ref>\n\nAlthough existing studies have generally focused on gender views or attitudes that are work-related, there has so far not been a study on specific domestic roles.

In contrast, there was no difference between the viewpoint of Chinese and Americans regarding domestic gender roles.\n\nA study by Richard Bagozzi, Nancy Wong and Youjae Yi, examines the interaction between culture and gender that produces distinct patterns of association between positive and negative emotions.<ref name=\"Bag\"/> The United States was considered a more 'independence-based culture', while China was considered ''''''inter'''''dependence-based'. In the US people tend to experience emotions in terms of opposition whereas in China, they do so in dialectical terms (i.e., those of logical argumentation and contradictory forces). The study continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing and in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show that \"gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture\". The evidence for differences in gender role was found during the [[socialization]] in work experiment, proving that \"women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means\".<ref name=\"Bag\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bagozzi | first1 = Richard P. | last2 = Wong | first2 = Nancy | last3 = Yi | first3 = Youjae | year = 1999 | title = The Role of Culture and Gender in the Relationship between Positive and Negative Affect | url = | journal = Cognition & Emotion | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 641\u201372 | doi=10.1080/026999399379023}}</ref> The study extended to the biological characteristics of both gender groups \u2014 for a higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, the cultural patterns became more evident for women than for men.\n\n==Communication==\n{{See also|Language and gender|Gender differences in social network service use|Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures}}\nGender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication; and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication.\n\nCommunication plays a large role in the process in which people become male or female because each gender is taught different linguistic practices. Gender is dictated by society through expectations of behavior and appearances, and then is shared from one person to another, by the process of communication.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Gender in Communication, A Critical Introduction|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-2009-3|location = |pages = 3}}</ref> Gender does not create communication, communication creates gender.<ref>DeFrancisco, Victoria L., Catherine Helen Palczewski, and Danielle Dick McGeough.

She believed women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, causing them to be more developed in nonverbal communication.\n\nMen, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and to be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.<ref>Fischer, A.

Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and 'complicated emotional states', and is also the 'mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] and emotional meanings'.\n\nGender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire, for example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express their sexual interest.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R | last2 = Catanese | first2 = K | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K | year = 2001 | title = Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive?

The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys.\n\nThe third was a series of questionnaires such as an \"Attitude Toward Women Scale\", \"[[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]]\", and \"Schaefer and Edgerton Scale\" which looked at the family values of the mother.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labelling and stereotyping.\n\nThey also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them.

This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, [[Seduction|seductress]], is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of [[sexual harassment]].

Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's Suffrage Movement]] of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from \"homemakers\" and \"caregivers\", women were now factory workers and \"breadwinners\" for the family.\n\nHowever, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, [[middle-class]] families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities. Thus established what many modern critics describe as the \"private sphere\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rotman | first1 = Deborah L. | year = 2006 | title = Separate Spheres?

According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'', in which she states, \"Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances.\"<ref>''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00544-0}}</ref>\n\nOne example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]\u2019s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, \u201cabasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.\u201d<ref>Shuttleworth, Sally. \"Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era.\" Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science. Eds. Mary Jacobus, Evelyn Fox Keller and Sally Shuttleworth. New York: Routledge, 1990. 47\u201370</ref> In other words, this shows what it meant to grow up into the roles (gender roles) of a female in Victorian England, which transitioned from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.\n\n===Men's rights===\n{{Main|Men's rights movement}}\n{{see also|Fathers' rights movement}}\n[[File:Save Indian Families protest (New Delhi, 26 August 2007).jpg|thumb|250px|Protest in New Delhi for men's rights organized by the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]]]]\n\nThe men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]].

This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and [[parachurch organizations]].\n\nMany leadership roles in the organized church have been restricted to males. In the [[Sex, gender and the Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as [[pope]], [[patriarch]], and [[bishop]]. Women may serve as [[abbess]]es. Most mainstream [[Protestants|Protestant]] denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups are tightening their constraints in reaction. [[Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches have embraced the ordination of women since their founding.\n\nChristian traditions that officially recognize \"[[saint]]s\", as persons of exceptional holiness of life having attained the [[beatific vision]] ([[heaven]]), do list women in that group. Most prominent is [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]] who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the \"[[Theotokos]]\", i.e. \"Mother of God\", the son born of her, Jesus, being God Incarnate, that is, both God and Man. \nWomen prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, [[doctors of the church]], founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. [[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.\n\n====Islam====\n{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}\n\nAccording to Dhami and Sheikh, gender roles in Muslim countries are centered on the importance of the family unit, which is viewed as the basis of a balanced and healthy society.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dhami |first1=Sangeeta |title=The Muslim family |journal=West J Med |date=Nov 2000 |volume=173 |issue=5 |pages=352\u2013356 |pmid=11069879 |pmc=1071164 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.173.5.352 }}</ref> Islamic views on gender roles and family are traditionally conservative.\n\nMany Muslim-majority countries, most prominently Saudi Arabia, have interpretations of religious doctrine regarding gender roles embedded in their laws.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Offenhauer |first1=P. |title=Women in Islamic Societies: A selected review of social scientific literature |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Women_Islamic_Societies.pdf}}</ref> In the [[United Arab Emirates]], non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more [[modesty|modestly]], due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.\n\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. This norm may sometimes be objected to by women visiting from other countries - but they may nevertheless decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interests of their own safety. For example, in Egypt, women who do not dress \"[[modesty|modestly]]\" - whether they are Muslims or not - may be perceived to be akin to prostitutes by men.\n\n[[Muhammad]] described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith Collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:\n:<blockquote>\"A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother!'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your father'\"</blockquote>In Muslim culture, women are seen as having a similar status to men, however, men are seen as a degree above women according to the qur'an.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/2/228?translations=22,101,18,17,84,19,21,85,95,20|title=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|website=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> How gender roles are honored is largely cultural.

Women, being underrepresented in children's television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steyer|first1=Isabella|date=2014|title=Gender representations in children's media and their influence|journal=Campus-Wide Information Systems|volume=31|issue=2/3|pages=171\u2013180|doi=10.1108/CWIS-11-2013-0065}}</ref>\n\n====Social Interaction====\nGendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex.<ref name=\":2\" /> Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different.<ref name=\":2\" /> One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.<ref>Lindsey, L.

Gender roles can be defined as the behaviors, values, and attitudes that a society considers appropriate for both male and female.<ref name=\":0\"/> Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family.<ref name=\":0\"/> However, in today's society the division of roles are starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriage in order to share responsibilities. This revolutionary view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes.

In Asia, Hong Kong is very close to the USA because the female surgeons in these societies are focused heavily on home life, whereas Japan is focused more on work life.

Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or ''instruments'') that have been translated, which potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:\n* Attitudes Towards Women Scale,\n* Sex-Role Egalitarian Scale, and\n* Sex-Role Ideology Scale.\nThrough such tests, it is known that American southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual's culture. This also may differ among compatriots whose 'cultures' are a few hundred miles apart.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = Lei | year = 1999 | title = Gender Role Egalitarian Attitudes in Beijing, Hong Kong, Florida, and Michigan | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 6| pages = 722\u201341 | doi=10.1177/0022022199030006004}}</ref>\n\nAlthough existing studies have generally focused on gender views or attitudes that are work-related, there has so far not been a study on specific domestic roles.

In contrast, there was no difference between the viewpoint of Chinese and Americans regarding domestic gender roles.\n\nA study by Richard Bagozzi, Nancy Wong and Youjae Yi, examines the interaction between culture and gender that produces distinct patterns of association between positive and negative emotions.<ref name=\"Bag\"/> The United States was considered a more 'independence-based culture', while China was considered ''''''inter'''''dependence-based'. In the US people tend to experience emotions in terms of opposition whereas in China, they do so in dialectical terms (i.e., those of logical argumentation and contradictory forces). The study continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing and in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show that \"gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture\". The evidence for differences in gender role was found during the [[socialization]] in work experiment, proving that \"women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means\".<ref name=\"Bag\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bagozzi | first1 = Richard P. | last2 = Wong | first2 = Nancy | last3 = Yi | first3 = Youjae | year = 1999 | title = The Role of Culture and Gender in the Relationship between Positive and Negative Affect | url = | journal = Cognition & Emotion | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 641\u201372 | doi=10.1080/026999399379023}}</ref> The study extended to the biological characteristics of both gender groups \u2014 for a higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, the cultural patterns became more evident for women than for men.\n\n==Communication==\n{{See also|Language and gender|Gender differences in social network service use|Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures}}\nGender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication; and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication.\n\nCommunication plays a large role in the process in which people become male or female because each gender is taught different linguistic practices. Gender is dictated by society through expectations of behavior and appearances, and then is shared from one person to another, by the process of communication.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Gender in Communication, A Critical Introduction|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-2009-3|location = |pages = 3}}</ref> Gender does not create communication, communication creates gender.<ref>DeFrancisco, Victoria L., Catherine Helen Palczewski, and Danielle Dick McGeough.

Baltimore, MD, US: Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref> In her study, she noted women smile and laugh more and have a better understanding of nonverbal cues. She believed women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, causing them to be more developed in nonverbal communication.\n\nMen, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and to be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.<ref>Fischer, A.

Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and 'complicated emotional states', and is also the 'mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] and emotional meanings'.\n\nGender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire, for example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express their sexual interest.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R | last2 = Catanese | first2 = K | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K | year = 2001 | title = Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive?

The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys.\n\nThe third was a series of questionnaires such as an \"Attitude Toward Women Scale\", \"[[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]]\", and \"Schaefer and Edgerton Scale\" which looked at the family values of the mother.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labelling and stereotyping.\n\nThey also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them.

This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, [[Seduction|seductress]], is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of [[sexual harassment]].

Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's Suffrage Movement]] of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from \"homemakers\" and \"caregivers\", women were now factory workers and \"breadwinners\" for the family.\n\nHowever, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, [[middle-class]] families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities. Thus established what many modern critics describe as the \"private sphere\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rotman | first1 = Deborah L. | year = 2006 | title = Separate Spheres?

Luisita Lopez Torregrosa has noted, \"Women are ahead of men in education (last year, 55 percent of U.S. college graduates were female).

According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'', in which she states, \"Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances.\"<ref>''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00544-0}}</ref>\n\nOne example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]\u2019s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, \u201cabasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.\u201d<ref>Shuttleworth, Sally. \"Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era.\" Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science. Eds. Mary Jacobus, Evelyn Fox Keller and Sally Shuttleworth. New York: Routledge, 1990. 47\u201370</ref> In other words, this shows what it meant to grow up into the roles (gender roles) of a female in Victorian England, which transitioned from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.\n\n===Men's rights===\n{{Main|Men's rights movement}}\n{{see also|Fathers' rights movement}}\n[[File:Save Indian Families protest (New Delhi, 26 August 2007).jpg|thumb|250px|Protest in New Delhi for men's rights organized by the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]]]]\n\nThe men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]].

He moved to Bruges at the age of 20.<br>\n\nThe authors of the many books and articles that have been published over time on the Bruges painter Pieter Pourbus, have always made exceedingly brief mention of his origins. Most state that Pourbus was probably born in Gouda, and that very little else is known about his childhood. In suggesting as much, these authors rely on the statement made by artist biographer [[Karel_van_Mander|Karel van Mander]] in his renowned Painting Book (\u2018Schilder-boeck\u2019) of 1604. The authors conveniently skip Pourbus\u2019 time in Gouda, asserting that Pourbus \u2018based himself in Bruges from an early age\u2019.<ref>Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018.

Pourbus must have overwhelmed him with information about all of the beautiful sights of Bruges at that time, as he was the source for most of the information [[Karel_van_Mander|Van Mander]] provides regarding the Bruges school of painting.<ref>Article written by Paul Huvenne, \u00a7.1 page 9, in Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018. Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages</ref><br>\n\nEven so, Pourbus was not considered a native in Bruges itself; when he registers as a master painter with the guild of Sculptors and Saddlers in 1543 as \u2018Pieter Jansyns Poerbus\u2019, he is explicitly marked as a stranger (\u2018vrymde\u2019) in the records. He must have been 19 or 20 years old at the time, based on the mentions of his age in a range of documents. From there, we can conclude that he must have been born in 1523 or 1524. \nLuckily, we are able to shed some more light on the role Gouda played in his life by putting what little is known about his ties to the city in the context of late-medieval religious and social life In Gouda.<ref>Article written by Paul H.A.M.

Even so, there is only one person in the Gouda city archives who would actually qualify as Pourbus\u2019 father, namely \u2018Jan Pieterssoen Puerboss\u2019, who features in the city accounts in 1529. The accounts mention a payment made to him for \u2018painting the board that stands in front of the window\u2019. The mention is brief, but it allows us to corroborate [[Karel_van_Mander|Van Mander\u2019s]] claim about Pourbus\u2019 Gouda roots by a contemporary source. Moreover, the presumed Pourbus senior also paints for a living, although we cannot determine whether he has any real artistic skill. The mention most likely refers to painting a (town\u2019s) coat of arms on a shutter.<ref>Article written by Paul H.A.M. Abels, \u00a7. page 31, in Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages</ref>\n\n===== Pourbus' world in Gouda =====\nWhen Jan Pietersz Pourbus is granted this commission, his presumed son Pieter is still only a toddler. He grows\nup in a city that boasts an extraordinary spiritual and cultural climate, mainly thanks to the biblical humanist\nErasmus.<br>\nErasmus too is born to parents from Gouda. His father is a priest, meaning that his birth is unlawful.\nErasmus does whatever he can to conceal the fact of his \u2018nebulous birth\u2019 (as Gouda historian Ignatius Walvis calls it) and his Gouda roots. This antipathy is far from mutual; Erasmus has countless admirers and friends\nin Gouda, who keep the memory of him alive and propagate his philosophy. Education, church life, and\npolitics in sixteenth-century Gouda are steeped in Erasmus\u2019 ideas. The focus is on a return to a purer kind of faith, to the Greek source texts of the New Testament and the Greek and Latin authors (church fathers) of the first few centuries AD. Additionally, people aim for purity in both teachings and practice within the church. In the eyes of the biblical humanists, there are too many instances of wrongdoing and abuse of power within the church. Last but not least, the humanists strive towards preserving Christian unity through tolerance.\nDuring Pourbus\u2019 youth, Erasmus will have still been alive, albeit far from Gouda; he is living in Basel at the time, where he passes away in 1536.<br>\nPourbus may have even met his principal advocate in Gouda, physician Reinier Snov. The doctor is still living in Gouda when he dies, one year after his great example in far-away Basel.<ref>Article written by Paul H.A.M. Abels, \u00a7. page 32, in: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018. Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages</ref>\n\n===== From Gouda to Bruges =====\nSimilarly to how Pieter Crabeth comes to Gouda because there is a market there for his artisanal stained glass, Pourbus\u2019 journey to Bruges can be explained in such a way. Bruges is known to be a city that produces excellent painting, although that reputation is waning slightly when Pourbus arrives.<br>\nBefore he went to Bruges, he may have studied his craft with Utrecht-based painters such as [[Jan_van_Scorel|Jan van Scorel]] or the Leiden masters. Recent technical research suggests Leiden, more so than Utrecht.<br>\n[[Lucas_van_Leyden|Lucas van Leyden]] and [[Cornelis_Engebrechtsz.|Cornelis Engelbrechtsz]] pass away when Pourbus is still a child, but he may have come into contact with Engelbrechtsz\u2019s three sons, who followed in their father\u2019s footsteps and became painters in their own right.<br>\nBruges is familiar territory for many Gouda residents. Pourbus will have heard many stories about the city of Bruges when growing up; after all, the two cities are closely connected due to the vibrant beer trade, which was\nthe leading line of business in Gouda at the time.<br>\n\n=== Pourbus in Bruges ===\nShortly after he registers with the \u2019Sculptors and Saddlers\u2019 Guild in Bruges in 1543 ( the Bruges \"[[Guild_of_Saint_Luke|Guild of Saint Luke]]\"), Pieter Pourbus marries. He weds Anna, the youngest daughter of painter [[Lancelot_Blondeel|Lancelot Blondeel]]. His marriage to the daughter of an established artist lacking any male heirs is very important for his reputation and further career as a master painter.<ref>from the article written by Paul H.A.M. Abels, \u00a7. page 34, in: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018.

Pourbus integrates into the city of Bruges with ease. <br>\nHe becomes a member of the crossbowmen\u2019s guild of St George and often visits the rhetorician meetings organised by the Chamber of the Holy Spirit. [[Lancelot_Blondeel|Blondeel]], who is a well-respected person there, may have introduced him.<br>\nIt is unclear where Pourbus\u2019 initial training as a painter took place. Recent research into his underdrawings\npoints in the direction of Leiden.6 Very few concrete details of his first few years in Bruges are known. It would appear that he initially operated from under the wing of his successful father-in-law.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018.  86 pages. \u00a7.1 page 11</ref>\n===== Working in Blondeel's studio =====\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Last Supper - WGA18255.jpg|thumb|right| Pieter Pourbus - ''The last Supper'', 1548 - 46,5x63 - Groeningen Museum, Bruges]]\n[[Lancelot_Blondeel|Blondeel]], perhaps the most authoritative artist of his generation in Bruges, introduced an early form of Italian renaissance painting.<br>\nPourbus\u2019 earliest work is in line with this school of painting. In fact, it remains unclear in some cases whether the works are the result of collaboration or whether they were painted by him individually, for instance in the case of ''\"The Seven Joys of the Virgin\"'', which hangs in the Tournai Cathedral, for which these two artists join forces.<br>\nPourbus\u2019 smaller work ''\"Last Supper\"''<ref>Pourbus made later five other depictions of the Last Supper (all of imposing size) in addition to the present painting, including the 1559 Triptych of the Brotherhood of the Sacrament (Bruges, St. Salvatorskerk) and that of 1562 in the Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk, Bruges. The former still retains its original double-sided wings, the left one showing Melchisedech\u2019s Offering and the right one, Elijah Fed by the Angel, </ref> indicates that his father-in-law also introduced him to the ''\u2018Rederijker\u2019'' or rhetorician circles of amateur poets and reciting artists; it depicts the Last Supper as described in the Refrains of rhetorician [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_de_Dene Edward van Dene].<br>\n\n[[File:Pierre pourbus-triptico de los santos juanes-prado.jpg|thumb|center|750px|Pieter Pourbus - Tryptique du ''\"Bapt\u00e8me du Christ\"'',1549 - 241x377 - Musee du Prado, Madrid]]<br>\n\nIt is unclear exactly when Pourbus began working for himself. <br>\nFor example, he began painting for the Spanish art market at an early stage. <br>\nHis monumental triptych ''\"The Baptism of Christ\"'', which dates back to 1549 and now hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, indicates how grand these commissions can be.<br>\n\nOne of his works was recently unearthed, the Spanish epitaph of Martin Cruzat, which dates back to 1548. <br>\nThis is a classic Piet\u00e0 featuring the deceased\u2019s portrait, evidently intended for the grave in his parish church in Pamplona. <br>\nThe piece was on display for the public for the first time at the exhibition of the Museum Gouda in 2018.<br>\n\nAnother work that dates back to Pourbus\u2019 early years in Bruges is his only remaining non-religious history work, ''\"An Allegory of True Love\"'', currently part of the Wallace Collection in London. <br>\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Allegory of true love.jpg|thumb|350px|center| Pieter Pourbus - ''Allegory of true love'', c. 1547 - 132,8x205,7- Wallace collection, London]]This painting shows Pourbus\u2019s painting style as truly innovative.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.2 page 11</ref><br>\n===== Out of Blondeel's shadow =====\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus Portret1.jpg|thumb|200px|Pieter Pourbus ''Portrait of Jan van Eyewerve'', 1551 - Groeningemuseum, Bruges]] [[File:Pieter Pourbus Portret2.jpg|thumb|200px|Pieter Pourbus ''Portrait of Jacquemyne Buuck'', 1551, [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges]]As from 1549, Pourbus leaves his father-in-law\u2019s shadow. From this moment on, his name starts appearing in all sorts of historical documents with great frequency. <br>\nHe is named yearly, and sometimes even daily, in many official sources. <br>\nSome notable commissions will also have played a role in increasing his fame, such as the decorations for the Joyous entry of Charles V and prince Philip II in 1549 (\u2018Blijde intocht van Karel V en prins Filips in 1549\u2019), a design for a new banquet hall, and a ''\"Last Judgment\"'' (''\u2018Laatste Oordeel\u2019''); all of these are commissions for the so-called ''\u2018Brugse Vrije\u2019'' (also known as the Liberty of Bruges), the legally autonomous territory of Bruges.<br>\n\nAnother prominent commission was his works for the mausoleum of Margaret of Austria at the Annunciation Convent in Bruges, which the magnificent Annunciation currently displayed at Museum Gouda was part of.\nPourbus gradually became the preferred master painter of the bourgeoisie, such as wine merchant Jan van Eyewerve and his wife Jacquemyne Buuck. They had their portraits painted to celebrate their wedding. <br>\n\nThe fact that Pourbus expressly dates and signs his works throughout this period is indicative of the rise in his confidence.<br>\n\n\nPourbus also made many topographic maps. <br>\nHe began using a new methodology based on triangulation that resulted in very modern-looking maps.13 It was a new format for visual reports intended to support surveyors\u2019 legal reports. <br>\nIt is unknown how Pourbus obtained this knowledge, but his 1549 map of the canal between Damme and Sluis indicates that he was most likely already using the new technique at that time, constituting a grand innovative move in 1540s Bruges.<br>\nAll of this hard work paid off: in 1552, Pourbus bought Huis Rome (\u2018the Rome House\u2019) on the Heer Jan Admiraelstraat. [[Karel_van_Mander|Van Mander]] later writes that here, Pourbus set up the best painting studio he ever saw.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.2 page 13</ref>\n\n===== Active Guild member =====\nAs from 1551, Pourbus became a prominent and active member of his guild\u2019s council; he served two terms as dean of the guild and five terms as sworn elder. He was very committed to his guild duties; for example, as an elder, he participated in quality checks on fellow guild members. He visited Simon Puseel in response to the latter\u2019s poor performance in gilding the dome of the Jerusalem Chapel in Bruges. As a dean, he acted to prevent paintings from Dordrecht being sold inside the city walls. He also defended the guild\u2019s interests several times in the leasing of land it owned in the province of Zeeland. Clearly, Pourbus was a very active and committed member of the Bruges Guild of Sculptors and Saddlers.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.2 page 16</ref>\n\n=== Pourbus\u2019 best years ===\nThe decade following his breakthrough in 1550 boasts the best work of his career.<br>\n\n===== Pourbus truly surpasses himself as a portraitist... =====\nDuring this decade, Pourbus blossomed into a painter of group portraits that are second to none. Some wonderful examples wing-panels with Portraits of the Members of the Noble Confraternity of the Holy Blood and the Sacra Confrerie of St Salvators. In grouping the people depicted, Pourbus must have envisioned the work of Utrecht-based painter [[Jan_van_Scorel|Jan van Scorel]].<br>\nPourbus\u2019 fine portrait of Joris (?) van den Heede, whose family motto ''\u2018sint sine dentes sales\u2019'' (''\u2018be witty without spite\u2019'') was taken word for word from Erasmus\u2019 introduction to In Praise of Folly, is reminiscent of that of Jan van Eyewerve.\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus . Portrait of a young lady.1554.signed and dated.jpg|thumb|250px|Pieter Pourbus.''Portrait of a young lady''.signed and dated 1554.<br>\nPrivate collection]]\nAnd with his portraits of ''\"Pieter Dominicle and his wife Livina van der Beke\"'', Pourbus truly surpasses himself as a portraitist.<br>\n\nThe captivating elegance with which he portrays Livina van der Beke is even more evident in this smaller, but no less gracious ''\"Portrait of a young lady\"'', from a private collection.<br>\nAs there is no inscription or family crest, identifying the lady depicted is impossible, but her rich dress, distinguished appearance, and self-aware gaze would suggest that this is a lady of considerable standing.<br>\nHer dress, with its delicate lace collar, allows us to date the portrait as having been painted before 1560.<br>\nIt is a fine example of Pourbus\u2019 portrait style.<br>\nHe manages to lift the striking likeness that is expected of any portrait to an icon that radiates societal and spiritual values. In doing so, he endows the person depicted with a detached, but animated beauty that leaves no one unmoved.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.3 page 16 and 17</ref><br>\nIn an article published at the occasion of the exhibition at the Gouda Museum, the author describes the portrait as [https://marccouwenbergh.nl/de-mona-lisa-van-pieter-pourbus-meester-schilder-uit-gouda/ '''the Mona Lisa of Pourbus\"'']. <br>\nMoreover, a detailed following article<ref>https://marccouwenbergh.nl/anna-van-bueren-versus-de-mona-lisa-van-pieter-pourbus-meester-schilder-uit-gouda/</ref> draws attention on many similarities between this portrait and the portrait of [[Anna van Egmont]], first wife of [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], belonging to the Royal collection, The Hague. The comparison can also be found [[Anna_van_Egmont#A_newly_discovered_portrait_of_Anna_van_Egmont?|here]].\n\n===== ... and, becoming a history painter,...  =====\nPourbus is now also able to prove himself as a history painter.<br>\n\nHe follows up on his impressive Last Judgment, now part of the Groeningemuseum\u2019s collection, and the beautiful Annunciation in Museum Gouda with the smaller Crucifixion in 1557.<br>\n[[File:Pourbus-Vanbelle-Triptiek.jpg|thumb|left|500px|Pourbus - ''\"Van Belle Triptych\"'',1556 - St James' church, Bruges]]\nBut more than any other work, the Van Belle triptych illustrates how Pourbus\u2019 style has matured.<br>\nIn many ways, this triptych is a key piece in his oeuvre, not only because it is one of his best paintings, but also because it is so well documented in archival materials.\nFor example, one of the items that survived is the original design drawing that Pourbus presented to Joos Van Belle for his approval.<br>\nThe sheet bears handwritten comments, in which the artist agrees to portray the Madonna not with clenched hands but in a more resigned posture: ''\u2018with the arms pressed crosswise over one another\u2019''. The theme of Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows on the middle panel was a very popular one in Pourbus\u2019 day, and it will have been quite a challenge for the artist to come up with a new, convincing composition to depict the theme.\nPourbus\u2019 depiction of the Virgin Mary owes much to the statue of the Madonna with Child by Michelangelo at the Church of Our Lady in Bruges.<br>\n\nThe success that is now due to Pourbus is confirmed by his 1558 Piet\u00e0 at the \u00c9glise Saint-Maurice in Annecy and\nhis Adoration of the Golden Calf, painted around 1559, currently in show at the National Gallery in Dublin.<br>\n\nPourbus becomes the leading representative of the Italian High Renaissance as propagated in Antwerp by [[Frans_Floris|Frans Floris]]. This is a stylistic idiom that is completely contrary to the deep-seated gothic tradition. \nOne example of this high renaissance style is the grotesques in which he depicts the portraits of Mr and Mrs Ghuyse-Van Male.<br>\nAt this point, Pourbus\u2019 work features more translucent, confident brushwork and a clear composition style that manages to reconcile tradition and innovation. These aspects are readily apparent in the Van Belle triptych, in which he paraphrases the composition of Jan van Eyck\u2019s [[Virgin_and_Child_with_Canon_van_der_Paele|\"The Virgin and Child with Canon Van der Paele\"]] from 1436, which is now part of the collection at the Groeningemuseum in Bruges.<br>\nWith his innovation of the style, Pourbus makes his mark on the artistic production in Bruges and the surrounding area. As such, the Italian [[Lodovico_Guicciardini|Ludovico Guicciardini]] names him as one of the most important painters of his time in his ''\"Descrittione di tutti i Paesi Bassi\"'' or ''\"Description of all the Low Countries\"'' in 1567.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018.  86 pages. page 16 to 20</ref>\n\n===== ....is the leading painter in Bruges =====\nLancelot Blondeel passes away in 1561.<br>\nPourbus is now the leading painter in Bruges.<br>\nIn the years that follow, he teaches many an apprentice, including his son Frans, and [[Antoon_Claeissens|Antonius Claeissens]], who starts working for him at one point.<br>\nBusiness is going well, but artistically speaking, Pourbus appears to stagnate somewhat during this period.\nSeveral altar pieces that date from this period are a far cry from his best work. <br>\n[[File:Portrait of a woman with unknown coat of arms, 1565 -National Galleries of Scotland, ,Edinburg.jpg|thumb |Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait of a woman with unknown coat of arms'', 1565 -National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburg]]\nHowever, he does show his skills as an exquisite portraitist from time to time, such as in this Portrait of a twenty-six years old woman from Edinburg. <br>\n\nIn spite of the coat of arms, this young lady has not yet been identified. It has been suggested that she might be part of the De Grave family, who are originally from Flanders but settled in Andalusia.\nIf so, this would once again be a nod to the Spanish presence in Bruges at the time.<br>\n\nThe portrait displays such immense refinement and grace that it was taken to be a portrait of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots for much of the nineteenth century. <br>\n\nWith his smooth, enamel-like stylisation, Pourbus has imbued the woman\u2019s face with an introverted and enigmatic quality. It is reminiscent of [[Lodovico_Guicciardini|Guicciardini\u2019s]] assertions that in Bruges, ''\u2018the women are as beautiful, lovely, modest and temperate as in any city in these lands\u2019''.25<br>\n\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Portrait of Jan Lopez Gallo and His Three Sons - WGA18256.jpg|thumb|left|Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait of Jan Lopez Gallo and His Three Sons'', 1568 - Groeningen Museum, Bruges]]In 1567, Pourbus produces yet another portrait, of Knight Fran\u00e7ois van der Straten. He draws inspiration from an allegorical print by Cornelis Theunisz from 1537 in which a child, an hourglass, and a skull remind one of the transience of life in much the same way.26<br>\nVan der Straten was a leading authority in the Liberty of Bruges and an academically trained lawyer. The text that he points out on the note beneath his hand reads as follows: ''\u2018COGNITIO DEI ET NATVRAE RATIONANIS\u2019'' (''\u2018Knowledge of God and the Reasonable Nature\u2019''). This is a reference to his humanist view of life. His motto, ''\u2018ABSIT GLORIA\u2019'' (''\u2018reject glory\u2019''), once again brings to mind the notion of vanitas.<br>\nIn the same year, he also paints the portrait of Pieter de Corte, the freshly appointed bishop of the recently created bishopric of Bruges. <br>\nDe Corte was appointed by King Philip II of Spain. Considering the prestige involved in this commission, it was naturally granted to Pourbus. <br>\n\nHis Portrait of Juan Lopez Gallo and his sons, dating back to 1568, once again prove that the ties with his Spanish clientele had not weakened in the slightest [fig. 13].27 <br>\nHis work can even be found on the Canary Islands.28 There, Pourbus dealt with his clients\u2019 differing customs in a very special way, by adjusting the size of his retables to suit the size of altar that was customary in Spain at the time.29 <br>\nSometimes, he leaves the actual execution of paintings for his more distant clients to atelier staff, as shown in his Mount at Calvary at the Cathedral of San Pedro in Soria.30 <br>\n\n===== The year of the great map =====\nHis most important commission of the 1560s is the monumental Map of the Liberty of Bruges [fi g. 14]. <br>\nThe accounts allow us to trace Pourbus\u2019 steps almost on a daily basis during the many days he spends on this work. The documents tell us all about how he adapted existing materials or created new ones, who worked on the map with him, who came along with him (such as lawyers, surveyors, and magistrates), and how he repeatedly presented his progress to the client. He completed this magnum opus in 1571.<br>\n\n=== From 1570 to Pourbus death ===\n===== The 1570's =====\nAfter the enormous effort of the Great Map, it seems Pourbus had more time for regular commissions once\nagain. <br>\nHis students have since left his studio. His son [[Frans_Pourbus_the_Elder|Frans]] left for Antwerp in 1569 to make his fortune as a painter there, and [[Antoon_Claeissens|Antonius Claeissens]] became the official city painter of Bruges in 1570.31 <br>\nPourbus continues to paint portraits without a moment\u2019s rest.[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Portrait of Olivier van Nieulant - WGA18257.jpg|thumb|left | Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait of Olivier van Nieulant'' - 1573 - <br>Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp]]\nHis style does change slightly, as evidenced by his portrait of Olivier Nieulant dated 1573, which is now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp.\n\nHis brushwork becomes less transparent and more enamel-like. This shift is also apparent in his history paintings, such as the Altarpiece of St Hubert in the collection of Museum Gouda.\nThe shift lends a cooler appearance, a more classicist quality to his work, but also makes it slightly more rigid.<br>\n\nIt is remarkable how well Pourbus is able to focus his compositions or inventions on the Italian renaissance\nidiom, considering the fact that he never went to Italy.\nA good example of this, once again, is the Altarpiece of St Hubert, painted before 1572, which is praised by [[Karel_van_Mander|Mander]] as ''\u2018a beautiful temple, with the perspective very well done\u2019''.<br>\n\nUsually, Pourbus draws his inspiration for the Italian renaissance style from contemporary graphics such as those by D\u00fcrer, Raphael, and Titian. For example, he drew strongly on Titian for the middle panel of the Damhouder Triptych at the Church of Our Lady in Bruges, for which he also designed a frame entirely in line with the renaissance style.<br>\n\nAs a well-established painter, Pourbus is occasionally seen as too expensive during this period. <br>\nFor example, in autumn of 1571, he creates a design for an altarpiece for the Church of Our Lady in Damme, but a different, cheaper painter, Jacob van den Coornhuuse, is commissioned to do the work instead. <br>\n\nEven so, Pourbus\u2019 studio continues to run smoothly throughout the 1570s. Among others, he works in close collaboration with [[Antoon_Claeissens|Antonius Claeissens]], who utilises Pourbus\u2019 style more than anyone else in Bruges in the early years of his career. <br>\nThe monumental piece \"Lamentation\" from the Schorr collection, one of the highlights of the exposition at Museum Gouda in 2018, is the result of intensive collaboration between the two [fig. 15].<br>\n\n===== Darker years =====\nIn 1578, a military force comes knocking on the city gates of Bruges. <br>\nThere is little resistance to the invading force.36 Just like Ghent before it, Bruges becomes a Calvinist republic. The city that barely felt the torrent of the Iconoclastic Fury in 1566 is unable to escape the stranglehold of the Eighty Years\u2019 War. <br>\nOnce the threat of war increases after the Pacification of Ghent fails, the city\u2019s magistrate repeatedly asks the Pourbus for his advice on building the city\u2019s defenses. His knowledge of water management, for instance, can be of use in flooding certain areas as a defensive manoeuvre.37<br>\nEven after the change in power that follows the city\u2019s capture in 1578, Pourbus continues to serve the now Protestant city authorities and enjoys the confidence of the magistrate. For example, he is appointed district head of his district in the Sint-Nicolaas-Zestendeel in December 1580. This may indicate that he converted\nto Calvinism, like his son. After all, the switch from Catholicism to Calvinism in Bruges means that Pourbus\nbecomes intimately entwined in the Protestant network.<br>\nHe had already painted the portraits of various prominent Protestants in previous years, such as the wartime mayor Jan Wyts and Calvinist leaders such as Pieter Dominicle.\nPourbus barely has time for painting during these years.<br>\n[[File:Zeghere van Male Pierter Pourbus 1578.jpg|thumb|Zeghere van Male Pieter Pourbus 1578]]\nHis epitaph for the Catholic Zeger van Male probably dates back to 1578, before the invasion by Ghent Protestants. During this period, Pourbus is mainly active as a water management expert and engineer.\nIn 1580, he paints a peculiar plan of the Abbey of the Dunes that was intended to serve as a guide for the\nreconstruction of the monastic complex after the war.\nApparently, he has enough credibility within the suppressed Catholic community left to be granted this commission. On the other hand, in autumn of that same year, he also creates the designs for the deconsecrated\nChurch of St Christopher (the site for which he painted the fishmongers\u2019 altar with his son only four years previ- ously) to be turned into a market hall, because it was no longer permitted to be used for worship.<br>\n\nPieter Pourbus dies in January of 1584.<br>\n\nHe may have been one of the many victims of the plague that strikes Bruges at the time. His widow, Anna Blondeel, is allocated a pension by both the city\u2019s magistrate and the Liberty of Bruges. Pourbus\u2019 memory is honored in many different ways. His portrait is hung in the guildhall as a memento to him.42<br>\n\n== Founding Father of a painting dynasty ==\nPourbus\u2019 oeuvre is often referred to as the swan song of the old Bruges school of painting. <br>\nAt the same time, he was also a notorious innovator. In terms of art history, he was the leading figure of his generation in Bruges.<br>\nHe is an all-round artist that practises his art in every register, from very simple matters to providing the\nLiberty\u2019s water authority with strategic advice.<br>\nStylistically speaking, he is part of the generation of [[Frans_Floris|Frans Floris]], the generation that realized the breakthrough of the Italian Renaissance in the Low Countries. The Joyous Entry of Charles V and prince Philip II, which dates from 1549, is a testament to that.<br>\n\nIt marks the perfect occasion for introducing the public to radical new innovations. As such, Pourbus manages\nto make a name for himself during his lifetime as one of the most important painters of his generation, both\nin Bruges and elsewhere; for example, Italian contem- poraries such as historian [[Lodovico Guicciardini|Ludovico Guicciardini]] and\nartist biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] make mention of him.<br>\nPourbus develops a very recognizable hand, characterized by classicist restraint, with a restrained style that is dominated primarily by clear lines. <br>\nWhile comparing his artistic personality to contemporaries such as Maarten de Vos and Pieter Brueghel the Elder may force one to put his talent into a wider perspective, he is unmatched\nas a portraitist. <br>\nHe continues to surprise on that front throughout his entire career, both with individual\nportraits and group depictions. This sets him apart as an extraordinary visual chronicler of the eventful\nhistory of sixteenth-century Bruges.\nPourbus\u2019 influence on his immediate surroundings\npersists.43 <br>\nAs mentor to his son and grandson, [[Frans_Pourbus_the_Elder|Frans the Elder]] and [[Frans_Pourbus_the_Younger|Frans the Younger]], he gains international renown.<br>\nAs such, Pourbus is the founding father of an artistic lineage that will set the tone in the field of portraiture for three generations, until the arrival of the baroque portrait supersedes them.\n\n==Works==\n\nThe [[Groeningemuseum]] in Bruges displays many of his works.  <br>\nThe [https://www.museumgouda.nl/nl Gouda Museum] possesses also works by the artist. <br>\nThe Sint Janskerk and the [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges]] have some of his art on display.\n\n<gallery heights=\"225px\" widths=\"170px\">\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Portrait of Gentleman.jpg|''Portrait of a gentleman in armour'', [[Mus\u00e9e de Picardie]], France\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Christian van der Goes.jpg|''Portrait of [[Christian van der Goes]]'', 1574\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Portret1.jpg|''Portrait of Jan van Eyewerve'', 1551, [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Portret2.jpg|''Portrait of Jacquemyne Buuck'', 1551, [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges\nFile:Pierre Pourbus - Bearded, red-headed Man, seated - Google Art Project.jpg|''Bearded, red-headed man, seated'', 1555\nFile:Pieter_Pourbus_._Portrait_of_a_young_lady.1554.signed_and_dated.jpg |''Portrait of a young noble lady'', Signed and dated 1554,  Private Collection\nFile:Laatste Avondmaal, 1548, [[Groeningemuseum]], 0040033000.jpg|''The last supper'', 1548,  Groeningemuseum, Bruges\nFile:Brugge Pieter Pourbus (1523-1584) - Het Laatste Avondmaal (1562) 9-03-2010 16-16-12kopie.jpg|thumb|''The Last Supper'', 1562, [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges\nFile:Pieter Pourbus - Allegory of true love.jpg|''Allegory of true love'', c.1547, [[Wallace Collection]]\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Publications ==\n# Paul Huvenne, ''Pierre Pourbus, peintre brugeois, 1524-1584,'' cat. exp., Mus\u00e9e Memling (H\u00f4pital Saint-Jean), 29 juin-30 septembre 1984, Bruges, Cr\u00e9dit Communal, 1984.\n# Paul Philippot, ''La Peinture dans les anciens Pays-Bas xve\u2009\u2013\u2009xvie si\u00e8cles'', Paris, Flammarion, 1994, 303 p., ({{ISBN|978-2-08010-937-8}}), p. 230-231.\n# Maryan W.

He moved to Bruges at the age of 20.<br>\n\nThe authors of the many books and articles that have been published over time on the Bruges painter Pieter Pourbus, have always made exceedingly brief mention of his origins. Most state that Pourbus was probably born in Gouda, and that very little else is known about his childhood. In suggesting as much, these authors rely on the statement made by artist biographer [[Karel_van_Mander|Karel van Mander]] in his renowned Painting Book (\u2018Schilder-boeck\u2019) of 1604. The authors conveniently skip Pourbus\u2019 time in Gouda, asserting that Pourbus \u2018based himself in Bruges from an early age\u2019.<ref>Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018.

Abels, \u00a7.1, page 31</ref><br>\n\n''\"Even so, I would not like to conceal any of the most special. That is why I wish to present this view of\nPieter Pourbus\u2019.

Pourbus must have overwhelmed him with information about all of the beautiful sights of Bruges at that time, as he was the source for most of the information [[Karel_van_Mander|Van Mander]] provides regarding the Bruges school of painting.<ref>Article written by Paul Huvenne, \u00a7.1 page 9, in Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018. Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages</ref><br>\n\nEven so, Pourbus was not considered a native in Bruges itself; when he registers as a master painter with the guild of Sculptors and Saddlers in 1543 as \u2018Pieter Jansyns Poerbus\u2019, he is explicitly marked as a stranger (\u2018vrymde\u2019) in the records. He must have been 19 or 20 years old at the time, based on the mentions of his age in a range of documents. From there, we can conclude that he must have been born in 1523 or 1524. \nLuckily, we are able to shed some more light on the role Gouda played in his life by putting what little is known about his ties to the city in the context of late-medieval religious and social life In Gouda.<ref>Article written by Paul H.A.M.

Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages</ref>\n\n===== His presumed father =====\nThe name Pourbus features several times in Gouda at the start of the sixteenth century. Even so, there is only one person in the Gouda city archives who would actually qualify as Pourbus\u2019 father, namely \u2018Jan Pieterssoen Puerboss\u2019, who features in the city accounts in 1529. The accounts mention a payment made to him for \u2018painting the board that stands in front of the window\u2019. The mention is brief, but it allows us to corroborate [[Karel_van_Mander|Van Mander\u2019s]] claim about Pourbus\u2019 Gouda roots by a contemporary source. Moreover, the presumed Pourbus senior also paints for a living, although we cannot determine whether he has any real artistic skill. The mention most likely refers to painting a (town\u2019s) coat of arms on a shutter.<ref>Article written by Paul H.A.M. Abels, \u00a7. page 31, in Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages</ref>\n\n===== Pourbus' world in Gouda =====\nWhen Jan Pietersz Pourbus is granted this commission, his presumed son Pieter is still only a toddler. He grows\nup in a city that boasts an extraordinary spiritual and cultural climate, mainly thanks to the biblical humanist\nErasmus.<br>\nErasmus too is born to parents from Gouda. His father is a priest, meaning that his birth is unlawful.\nErasmus does whatever he can to conceal the fact of his \u2018nebulous birth\u2019 (as Gouda historian Ignatius Walvis calls it) and his Gouda roots. This antipathy is far from mutual; Erasmus has countless admirers and friends\nin Gouda, who keep the memory of him alive and propagate his philosophy. Education, church life, and\npolitics in sixteenth-century Gouda are steeped in Erasmus\u2019 ideas. The focus is on a return to a purer kind of faith, to the Greek source texts of the New Testament and the Greek and Latin authors (church fathers) of the first few centuries AD. Additionally, people aim for purity in both teachings and practice within the church. In the eyes of the biblical humanists, there are too many instances of wrongdoing and abuse of power within the church. Last but not least, the humanists strive towards preserving Christian unity through tolerance.\nDuring Pourbus\u2019 youth, Erasmus will have still been alive, albeit far from Gouda; he is living in Basel at the time, where he passes away in 1536.<br>\nPourbus may have even met his principal advocate in Gouda, physician Reinier Snov. The doctor is still living in Gouda when he dies, one year after his great example in far-away Basel.<ref>Article written by Paul H.A.M. Abels, \u00a7. page 32, in: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018. Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages</ref>\n\n===== From Gouda to Bruges =====\nSimilarly to how Pieter Crabeth comes to Gouda because there is a market there for his artisanal stained glass, Pourbus\u2019 journey to Bruges can be explained in such a way. Bruges is known to be a city that produces excellent painting, although that reputation is waning slightly when Pourbus arrives.<br>\nBefore he went to Bruges, he may have studied his craft with Utrecht-based painters such as [[Jan_van_Scorel|Jan van Scorel]] or the Leiden masters. Recent technical research suggests Leiden, more so than Utrecht.<br>\n[[Lucas_van_Leyden|Lucas van Leyden]] and [[Cornelis_Engebrechtsz.|Cornelis Engelbrechtsz]] pass away when Pourbus is still a child, but he may have come into contact with Engelbrechtsz\u2019s three sons, who followed in their father\u2019s footsteps and became painters in their own right.<br>\nBruges is familiar territory for many Gouda residents. Pourbus will have heard many stories about the city of Bruges when growing up; after all, the two cities are closely connected due to the vibrant beer trade, which was\nthe leading line of business in Gouda at the time.<br>\n\n=== Pourbus in Bruges ===\nShortly after he registers with the \u2019Sculptors and Saddlers\u2019 Guild in Bruges in 1543 ( the Bruges \"[[Guild_of_Saint_Luke|Guild of Saint Luke]]\"), Pieter Pourbus marries. He weds Anna, the youngest daughter of painter [[Lancelot_Blondeel|Lancelot Blondeel]]. His marriage to the daughter of an established artist lacking any male heirs is very important for his reputation and further career as a master painter.<ref>from the article written by Paul H.A.M. Abels, \u00a7. page 34, in: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018. Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda. 86 pages</ref> <br>\nIn 1545 or 1546, she bears him a son, Frans ([[Frans_Pourbus_the_Elder|\u2018the elder\u2019]]), who is predestined to take up his father\u2019s brush after him. Pourbus integrates into the city of Bruges with ease. <br>\nHe becomes a member of the crossbowmen\u2019s guild of St George and often visits the rhetorician meetings organised by the Chamber of the Holy Spirit. [[Lancelot_Blondeel|Blondeel]], who is a well-respected person there, may have introduced him.<br>\nIt is unclear where Pourbus\u2019 initial training as a painter took place. Recent research into his underdrawings\npoints in the direction of Leiden.6 Very few concrete details of his first few years in Bruges are known. It would appear that he initially operated from under the wing of his successful father-in-law.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018.  86 pages. \u00a7.1 page 11</ref>\n===== Working in Blondeel's studio =====\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Last Supper - WGA18255.jpg|thumb|right| Pieter Pourbus - ''The last Supper'', 1548 - 46,5x63 - Groeningen Museum, Bruges]]\n[[Lancelot_Blondeel|Blondeel]], perhaps the most authoritative artist of his generation in Bruges, introduced an early form of Italian renaissance painting.<br>\nPourbus\u2019 earliest work is in line with this school of painting. In fact, it remains unclear in some cases whether the works are the result of collaboration or whether they were painted by him individually, for instance in the case of ''\"The Seven Joys of the Virgin\"'', which hangs in the Tournai Cathedral, for which these two artists join forces.<br>\nPourbus\u2019 smaller work ''\"Last Supper\"''<ref>Pourbus made later five other depictions of the Last Supper (all of imposing size) in addition to the present painting, including the 1559 Triptych of the Brotherhood of the Sacrament (Bruges, St. Salvatorskerk) and that of 1562 in the Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk, Bruges. The former still retains its original double-sided wings, the left one showing Melchisedech\u2019s Offering and the right one, Elijah Fed by the Angel, </ref> indicates that his father-in-law also introduced him to the ''\u2018Rederijker\u2019'' or rhetorician circles of amateur poets and reciting artists; it depicts the Last Supper as described in the Refrains of rhetorician [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_de_Dene Edward van Dene].<br>\n\n[[File:Pierre pourbus-triptico de los santos juanes-prado.jpg|thumb|center|750px|Pieter Pourbus - Tryptique du ''\"Bapt\u00e8me du Christ\"'',1549 - 241x377 - Musee du Prado, Madrid]]<br>\n\nIt is unclear exactly when Pourbus began working for himself. <br>\nFor example, he began painting for the Spanish art market at an early stage. <br>\nHis monumental triptych ''\"The Baptism of Christ\"'', which dates back to 1549 and now hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, indicates how grand these commissions can be.<br>\n\nOne of his works was recently unearthed, the Spanish epitaph of Martin Cruzat, which dates back to 1548. <br>\nThis is a classic Piet\u00e0 featuring the deceased\u2019s portrait, evidently intended for the grave in his parish church in Pamplona. <br>\nThe piece was on display for the public for the first time at the exhibition of the Museum Gouda in 2018.<br>\n\nAnother work that dates back to Pourbus\u2019 early years in Bruges is his only remaining non-religious history work, ''\"An Allegory of True Love\"'', currently part of the Wallace Collection in London. <br>\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Allegory of true love.jpg|thumb|350px|center| Pieter Pourbus - ''Allegory of true love'', c. 1547 - 132,8x205,7- Wallace collection, London]]This painting shows Pourbus\u2019s painting style as truly innovative.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.2 page 11</ref><br>\n===== Out of Blondeel's shadow =====\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus Portret1.jpg|thumb|200px|Pieter Pourbus ''Portrait of Jan van Eyewerve'', 1551 - Groeningemuseum, Bruges]] [[File:Pieter Pourbus Portret2.jpg|thumb|200px|Pieter Pourbus ''Portrait of Jacquemyne Buuck'', 1551, [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges]]As from 1549, Pourbus leaves his father-in-law\u2019s shadow. From this moment on, his name starts appearing in all sorts of historical documents with great frequency. <br>\nHe is named yearly, and sometimes even daily, in many official sources. <br>\nSome notable commissions will also have played a role in increasing his fame, such as the decorations for the Joyous entry of Charles V and prince Philip II in 1549 (\u2018Blijde intocht van Karel V en prins Filips in 1549\u2019), a design for a new banquet hall, and a ''\"Last Judgment\"'' (''\u2018Laatste Oordeel\u2019''); all of these are commissions for the so-called ''\u2018Brugse Vrije\u2019'' (also known as the Liberty of Bruges), the legally autonomous territory of Bruges.<br>\n\nAnother prominent commission was his works for the mausoleum of Margaret of Austria at the Annunciation Convent in Bruges, which the magnificent Annunciation currently displayed at Museum Gouda was part of.\nPourbus gradually became the preferred master painter of the bourgeoisie, such as wine merchant Jan van Eyewerve and his wife Jacquemyne Buuck. They had their portraits painted to celebrate their wedding. <br>\n\nThe fact that Pourbus expressly dates and signs his works throughout this period is indicative of the rise in his confidence.<br>\n\n\nPourbus also made many topographic maps. <br>\nHe began using a new methodology based on triangulation that resulted in very modern-looking maps.13 It was a new format for visual reports intended to support surveyors\u2019 legal reports. <br>\nIt is unknown how Pourbus obtained this knowledge, but his 1549 map of the canal between Damme and Sluis indicates that he was most likely already using the new technique at that time, constituting a grand innovative move in 1540s Bruges.<br>\nAll of this hard work paid off: in 1552, Pourbus bought Huis Rome (\u2018the Rome House\u2019) on the Heer Jan Admiraelstraat. [[Karel_van_Mander|Van Mander]] later writes that here, Pourbus set up the best painting studio he ever saw.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.2 page 13</ref>\n\n===== Active Guild member =====\nAs from 1551, Pourbus became a prominent and active member of his guild\u2019s council; he served two terms as dean of the guild and five terms as sworn elder. He was very committed to his guild duties; for example, as an elder, he participated in quality checks on fellow guild members. He visited Simon Puseel in response to the latter\u2019s poor performance in gilding the dome of the Jerusalem Chapel in Bruges. As a dean, he acted to prevent paintings from Dordrecht being sold inside the city walls. He also defended the guild\u2019s interests several times in the leasing of land it owned in the province of Zeeland. Clearly, Pourbus was a very active and committed member of the Bruges Guild of Sculptors and Saddlers.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.2 page 16</ref>\n\n=== Pourbus\u2019 best years ===\nThe decade following his breakthrough in 1550 boasts the best work of his career.<br>\n\n===== Pourbus truly surpasses himself as a portraitist... =====\nDuring this decade, Pourbus blossomed into a painter of group portraits that are second to none. Some wonderful examples wing-panels with Portraits of the Members of the Noble Confraternity of the Holy Blood and the Sacra Confrerie of St Salvators. In grouping the people depicted, Pourbus must have envisioned the work of Utrecht-based painter [[Jan_van_Scorel|Jan van Scorel]].<br>\nPourbus\u2019 fine portrait of Joris (?) van den Heede, whose family motto ''\u2018sint sine dentes sales\u2019'' (''\u2018be witty without spite\u2019'') was taken word for word from Erasmus\u2019 introduction to In Praise of Folly, is reminiscent of that of Jan van Eyewerve.\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus . Portrait of a young lady.1554.signed and dated.jpg|thumb|250px|Pieter Pourbus.''Portrait of a young lady''.signed and dated 1554.<br>\nPrivate collection]]\nAnd with his portraits of ''\"Pieter Dominicle and his wife Livina van der Beke\"'', Pourbus truly surpasses himself as a portraitist.<br>\n\nThe captivating elegance with which he portrays Livina van der Beke is even more evident in this smaller, but no less gracious ''\"Portrait of a young lady\"'', from a private collection.<br>\nAs there is no inscription or family crest, identifying the lady depicted is impossible, but her rich dress, distinguished appearance, and self-aware gaze would suggest that this is a lady of considerable standing.<br>\nHer dress, with its delicate lace collar, allows us to date the portrait as having been painted before 1560.<br>\nIt is a fine example of Pourbus\u2019 portrait style.<br>\nHe manages to lift the striking likeness that is expected of any portrait to an icon that radiates societal and spiritual values. In doing so, he endows the person depicted with a detached, but animated beauty that leaves no one unmoved.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda'', 2018. 86 pages. \u00a7.3 page 16 and 17</ref><br>\nIn an article published at the occasion of the exhibition at the Gouda Museum, the author describes the portrait as [https://marccouwenbergh.nl/de-mona-lisa-van-pieter-pourbus-meester-schilder-uit-gouda/ '''the Mona Lisa of Pourbus\"'']. <br>\nMoreover, a detailed following article<ref>https://marccouwenbergh.nl/anna-van-bueren-versus-de-mona-lisa-van-pieter-pourbus-meester-schilder-uit-gouda/</ref> draws attention on many similarities between this portrait and the portrait of [[Anna van Egmont]], first wife of [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], belonging to the Royal collection, The Hague. The comparison can also be found [[Anna_van_Egmont#A_newly_discovered_portrait_of_Anna_van_Egmont?|here]].\n\n===== ... and, becoming a history painter,...  =====\nPourbus is now also able to prove himself as a history painter.<br>\n\nHe follows up on his impressive Last Judgment, now part of the Groeningemuseum\u2019s collection, and the beautiful Annunciation in Museum Gouda with the smaller Crucifixion in 1557.<br>\n[[File:Pourbus-Vanbelle-Triptiek.jpg|thumb|left|500px|Pourbus - ''\"Van Belle Triptych\"'',1556 - St James' church, Bruges]]\nBut more than any other work, the Van Belle triptych illustrates how Pourbus\u2019 style has matured.<br>\nIn many ways, this triptych is a key piece in his oeuvre, not only because it is one of his best paintings, but also because it is so well documented in archival materials.\nFor example, one of the items that survived is the original design drawing that Pourbus presented to Joos Van Belle for his approval.<br>\nThe sheet bears handwritten comments, in which the artist agrees to portray the Madonna not with clenched hands but in a more resigned posture: ''\u2018with the arms pressed crosswise over one another\u2019''. The theme of Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows on the middle panel was a very popular one in Pourbus\u2019 day, and it will have been quite a challenge for the artist to come up with a new, convincing composition to depict the theme.\nPourbus\u2019 depiction of the Virgin Mary owes much to the statue of the Madonna with Child by Michelangelo at the Church of Our Lady in Bruges.<br>\n\nThe success that is now due to Pourbus is confirmed by his 1558 Piet\u00e0 at the \u00c9glise Saint-Maurice in Annecy and\nhis Adoration of the Golden Calf, painted around 1559, currently in show at the National Gallery in Dublin.<br>\n\nPourbus becomes the leading representative of the Italian High Renaissance as propagated in Antwerp by [[Frans_Floris|Frans Floris]]. This is a stylistic idiom that is completely contrary to the deep-seated gothic tradition. \nOne example of this high renaissance style is the grotesques in which he depicts the portraits of Mr and Mrs Ghuyse-Van Male.<br>\nAt this point, Pourbus\u2019 work features more translucent, confident brushwork and a clear composition style that manages to reconcile tradition and innovation. These aspects are readily apparent in the Van Belle triptych, in which he paraphrases the composition of Jan van Eyck\u2019s [[Virgin_and_Child_with_Canon_van_der_Paele|\"The Virgin and Child with Canon Van der Paele\"]] from 1436, which is now part of the collection at the Groeningemuseum in Bruges.<br>\nWith his innovation of the style, Pourbus makes his mark on the artistic production in Bruges and the surrounding area. As such, the Italian [[Lodovico_Guicciardini|Ludovico Guicciardini]] names him as one of the most important painters of his time in his ''\"Descrittione di tutti i Paesi Bassi\"'' or ''\"Description of all the Low Countries\"'' in 1567.<ref>Paul Huvenne, in Catalogue of the exhibition Feb.17 - June 17 2108 at Museum Gouda: Marc De Beyer & Josephina De Fauw, ''\"Pieter Pourbus, Master painter of Gouda\"'', 2018.  86 pages. page 16 to 20</ref>\n\n===== ....is the leading painter in Bruges =====\nLancelot Blondeel passes away in 1561.<br>\nPourbus is now the leading painter in Bruges.<br>\nIn the years that follow, he teaches many an apprentice, including his son Frans, and [[Antoon_Claeissens|Antonius Claeissens]], who starts working for him at one point.<br>\nBusiness is going well, but artistically speaking, Pourbus appears to stagnate somewhat during this period.\nSeveral altar pieces that date from this period are a far cry from his best work. <br>\n[[File:Portrait of a woman with unknown coat of arms, 1565 -National Galleries of Scotland, ,Edinburg.jpg|thumb |Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait of a woman with unknown coat of arms'', 1565 -National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburg]]\nHowever, he does show his skills as an exquisite portraitist from time to time, such as in this Portrait of a twenty-six years old woman from Edinburg. <br>\n\nIn spite of the coat of arms, this young lady has not yet been identified. It has been suggested that she might be part of the De Grave family, who are originally from Flanders but settled in Andalusia.\nIf so, this would once again be a nod to the Spanish presence in Bruges at the time.<br>\n\nThe portrait displays such immense refinement and grace that it was taken to be a portrait of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots for much of the nineteenth century. <br>\n\nWith his smooth, enamel-like stylisation, Pourbus has imbued the woman\u2019s face with an introverted and enigmatic quality. It is reminiscent of [[Lodovico_Guicciardini|Guicciardini\u2019s]] assertions that in Bruges, ''\u2018the women are as beautiful, lovely, modest and temperate as in any city in these lands\u2019''.25<br>\n\n[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Portrait of Jan Lopez Gallo and His Three Sons - WGA18256.jpg|thumb|left|Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait of Jan Lopez Gallo and His Three Sons'', 1568 - Groeningen Museum, Bruges]]In 1567, Pourbus produces yet another portrait, of Knight Fran\u00e7ois van der Straten. He draws inspiration from an allegorical print by Cornelis Theunisz from 1537 in which a child, an hourglass, and a skull remind one of the transience of life in much the same way.26<br>\nVan der Straten was a leading authority in the Liberty of Bruges and an academically trained lawyer. The text that he points out on the note beneath his hand reads as follows: ''\u2018COGNITIO DEI ET NATVRAE RATIONANIS\u2019'' (''\u2018Knowledge of God and the Reasonable Nature\u2019''). This is a reference to his humanist view of life. His motto, ''\u2018ABSIT GLORIA\u2019'' (''\u2018reject glory\u2019''), once again brings to mind the notion of vanitas.<br>\nIn the same year, he also paints the portrait of Pieter de Corte, the freshly appointed bishop of the recently created bishopric of Bruges. <br>\nDe Corte was appointed by King Philip II of Spain. Considering the prestige involved in this commission, it was naturally granted to Pourbus. <br>\n\nHis Portrait of Juan Lopez Gallo and his sons, dating back to 1568, once again prove that the ties with his Spanish clientele had not weakened in the slightest [fig. 13].27 <br>\nHis work can even be found on the Canary Islands.28 There, Pourbus dealt with his clients\u2019 differing customs in a very special way, by adjusting the size of his retables to suit the size of altar that was customary in Spain at the time.29 <br>\nSometimes, he leaves the actual execution of paintings for his more distant clients to atelier staff, as shown in his Mount at Calvary at the Cathedral of San Pedro in Soria.30 <br>\n\n===== The year of the great map =====\nHis most important commission of the 1560s is the monumental Map of the Liberty of Bruges [fi g. 14]. <br>\nThe accounts allow us to trace Pourbus\u2019 steps almost on a daily basis during the many days he spends on this work. The documents tell us all about how he adapted existing materials or created new ones, who worked on the map with him, who came along with him (such as lawyers, surveyors, and magistrates), and how he repeatedly presented his progress to the client. He completed this magnum opus in 1571.<br>\n\n=== From 1570 to Pourbus death ===\n===== The 1570's =====\nAfter the enormous effort of the Great Map, it seems Pourbus had more time for regular commissions once\nagain. <br>\nHis students have since left his studio. His son [[Frans_Pourbus_the_Elder|Frans]] left for Antwerp in 1569 to make his fortune as a painter there, and [[Antoon_Claeissens|Antonius Claeissens]] became the official city painter of Bruges in 1570.31 <br>\nPourbus continues to paint portraits without a moment\u2019s rest.[[File:Pieter Pourbus - Portrait of Olivier van Nieulant - WGA18257.jpg|thumb|left | Pieter Pourbus - ''Portrait of Olivier van Nieulant'' - 1573 - <br>Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp]]\nHis style does change slightly, as evidenced by his portrait of Olivier Nieulant dated 1573, which is now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp.\n\nHis brushwork becomes less transparent and more enamel-like. This shift is also apparent in his history paintings, such as the Altarpiece of St Hubert in the collection of Museum Gouda.\nThe shift lends a cooler appearance, a more classicist quality to his work, but also makes it slightly more rigid.<br>\n\nIt is remarkable how well Pourbus is able to focus his compositions or inventions on the Italian renaissance\nidiom, considering the fact that he never went to Italy.\nA good example of this, once again, is the Altarpiece of St Hubert, painted before 1572, which is praised by [[Karel_van_Mander|Mander]] as ''\u2018a beautiful temple, with the perspective very well done\u2019''.<br>\n\nUsually, Pourbus draws his inspiration for the Italian renaissance style from contemporary graphics such as those by D\u00fcrer, Raphael, and Titian. For example, he drew strongly on Titian for the middle panel of the Damhouder Triptych at the Church of Our Lady in Bruges, for which he also designed a frame entirely in line with the renaissance style.<br>\n\nAs a well-established painter, Pourbus is occasionally seen as too expensive during this period. <br>\nFor example, in autumn of 1571, he creates a design for an altarpiece for the Church of Our Lady in Damme, but a different, cheaper painter, Jacob van den Coornhuuse, is commissioned to do the work instead. <br>\n\nEven so, Pourbus\u2019 studio continues to run smoothly throughout the 1570s. Among others, he works in close collaboration with [[Antoon_Claeissens|Antonius Claeissens]], who utilises Pourbus\u2019 style more than anyone else in Bruges in the early years of his career. <br>\nThe monumental piece \"Lamentation\" from the Schorr collection, one of the highlights of the exposition at Museum Gouda in 2018, is the result of intensive collaboration between the two [fig. 15].<br>\n\n===== Darker years =====\nIn 1578, a military force comes knocking on the city gates of Bruges. <br>\nThere is little resistance to the invading force.36 Just like Ghent before it, Bruges becomes a Calvinist republic. The city that barely felt the torrent of the Iconoclastic Fury in 1566 is unable to escape the stranglehold of the Eighty Years\u2019 War. <br>\nOnce the threat of war increases after the Pacification of Ghent fails, the city\u2019s magistrate repeatedly asks Pourbus for his advice on building the city\u2019s defences. His knowledge of water management, for instance, can be of use in flooding certain areas as a defensive manoeuvre.37<br>\nEven after the change in power that follows the city\u2019s capture in 1578, Pourbus continues to serve the now Protestant city authorities and enjoys the confidence of the magistrate. For example, he is appointed district head of his district in the Sint-Nicolaas-Zestendeel in December 1580. This may indicate that he converted\nto Calvinism, like his son. After all, the switch from Catholicism to Calvinism in Bruges means that Pourbus\nbecomes intimately entwined in the Protestant network.<br>\nHe had already painted the portraits of various prominent Protestants in previous years, such as the wartime mayor Jan Wyts and Calvinist leaders such as Pieter Dominicle.\nPourbus barely has time for painting during these years.<br>\n[[File:Zeghere van Male Pierter Pourbus 1578.jpg|thumb|Zeghere van Male Pieter Pourbus 1578]]\nHis epitaph for the Catholic Zeger van Male probably dates back to 1578, before the invasion by Ghent Protestants. During this period, Pourbus is mainly active as a water management expert and engineer.\nIn 1580, he paints a peculiar plan of the Abbey of the Dunes that was intended to serve as a guide for the\nreconstruction of the monastic complex after the war.\nApparently, he has enough credibility within the suppressed Catholic community left to be granted this commission. On the other hand, in autumn of that same year, he also creates the designs for the deconsecrated\nChurch of St Christopher (the site for which he painted the fishmongers\u2019 altar with his son only four years previ- ously) to be turned into a market hall, because it was no longer permitted to be used for worship.<br>\n\nPieter Pourbus dies in January of 1584.<br>\n\nHe may have been one of the many victims of the plague that strikes Bruges at the time. His widow, Anna Blondeel, is allocated a pension by both the city\u2019s magistrate and the Liberty of Bruges. Pourbus\u2019 memory is honoured in many different ways. His portrait is hung in the guildhall as a memento to him.42<br>\n\n== Founding Father of a painting dynasty ==\nPourbus\u2019 oeuvre is often referred to as the swan song of the old Bruges school of painting. <br>\nAt the same time, he was also a notorious innovator. In terms of art history, he was the leading figure of his generation in Bruges.<br>\nHe is an all-round artist that practises his art in every register, from very simple matters to providing the\nLiberty\u2019s water authority with strategic advice.<br>\nStylistically speaking, he is part of the generation of [[Frans_Floris|Frans Floris]], the generation that realised the breakthrough of the Italian Renaissance in the Low Countries. The Joyous Entry of Charles V and prince Philip II, which dates from 1549, is a testament to that.<br>\n\nIt marks the perfect occasion for introducing the public to radical new innovations. As such, Pourbus manages\nto make a name for himself during his lifetime as one of the most important painters of his generation, both\nin Bruges and elsewhere; for example, Italian contem- poraries such as historian [[Lodovico Guicciardini|Ludovico Guicciardini]] and\nartist biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] make mention of him.<br>\nPourbus develops a very recognisable hand, characterised by classicist restraint, with a restrained style that is dominated primarily by clear lines. <br>\nWhile comparing his artistic personality to contemporaries such as Maarten de Vos and Pieter Brueghel the Elder may force one to put his talent into a wider perspective, he is unmatched\nas a portraitist. <br>\nHe continues to surprise on that front throughout his entire career, both with individual\nportraits and group depictions. This sets him apart as an extraordinary visual chronicler of the eventful\nhistory of sixteenth-century Bruges.\nPourbus\u2019 influence on his immediate surroundings\npersists.43 <br>\nAs mentor to his son and grandson, [[Frans_Pourbus_the_Elder|Frans the Elder]] and [[Frans_Pourbus_the_Younger|Frans the Younger]], he gains international renown.<br>\nAs such, Pourbus is the founding father of an artistic lineage that will set the tone in the field of portraiture for three generations, until the arrival of the baroque portrait supersedes them.\n\n==Works==\n\nThe [[Groeningemuseum]] in Bruges displays many of his works.  <br>\nThe [https://www.museumgouda.nl/nl Gouda Museum] possesses also works by the artist. <br>\nThe Sint Janskerk and the [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges]] have some of his art on display.\n\n<gallery heights=\"225px\" widths=\"170px\">\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Portrait of Gentleman.jpg|''Portrait of a gentleman in armour'', [[Mus\u00e9e de Picardie]], France\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Christian van der Goes.jpg|''Portrait of [[Christian van der Goes]]'', 1574\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Portret1.jpg|''Portrait of Jan van Eyewerve'', 1551, [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges\nFile:Pieter Pourbus Portret2.jpg|''Portrait of Jacquemyne Buuck'', 1551, [[Groeningemuseum]], Bruges\nFile:Pierre Pourbus - Bearded, red-headed Man, seated - Google Art Project.jpg|''Bearded, red-headed man, seated'', 1555\nFile:Pieter_Pourbus_._Portrait_of_a_young_lady.1554.signed_and_dated.jpg |''Portrait of a young noble lady'', Signed and dated 1554,  Private Collection\nFile:Laatste Avondmaal, 1548, [[Groeningemuseum]], 0040033000.jpg|''The last supper'', 1548,  Groeningemuseum, Bruges\nFile:Brugge Pieter Pourbus (1523-1584) - Het Laatste Avondmaal (1562) 9-03-2010 16-16-12kopie.jpg|thumb|''The Last Supper'', 1562, [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges\nFile:Pieter Pourbus - Allegory of true love.jpg|''Allegory of true love'', c.1547, [[Wallace Collection]]\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Publications ==\n# Paul Huvenne, ''Pierre Pourbus, peintre brugeois, 1524-1584,'' cat. exp., Mus\u00e9e Memling (H\u00f4pital Saint-Jean), 29 juin-30 septembre 1984, Bruges, Cr\u00e9dit Communal, 1984.\n# Paul Philippot, ''La Peinture dans les anciens Pays-Bas xve\u2009\u2013\u2009xvie si\u00e8cles'', Paris, Flammarion, 1994, 303 p., ({{ISBN|978-2-08010-937-8}}), p. 230-231.\n# Maryan W.

The album featured his ground-breaking new musical system called Stratus. The Stratus Pianos are two self-playing, semi-generative player pianos which are triggered by a central piano played by Arnalds. The custom-built software was born out of two years of work by the composer and audio developer, Halldor Eldjarn.  As Arnalds plays a note on the piano, two different notes are generated by Stratus, creating unexpected harmonies and surprising melodic sequences. \n\nThe algorithms generated from Stratus were also used to create the album artwork. In an interview with ''[http://soundofboston.com/ Sound of Boston]'' Arnalds explains that the artist, Torsten Posselt from FELD studios, used the Stratus software as a starting point and made his own software that translated the same MIDI signals used for the music. Each dot corresponds to a piano note in the title track: 88 fields correspond to 88 notes; the thicker the dot, the higher the frequency of that note being played.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bedian |first1=Knar |title=Interview: \u00d3lafur Arnalds and Pianos That Go Bleep Bloop |url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-olafur-arnalds/ |website=Sound of Boston |publisher=Sound of Boston |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nList of tracks with collaborators:\n#\"re:member\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds) \n#\"unfold\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds & SOHN)\n#\"saman\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"brot\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"inconsist\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"they sink\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"ypsilon\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"partial\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"momentary\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"undir\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"ekki hugsa\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"nyepi\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n\n==Personal life==\n\u00d3lafur's cousin [[\u00d3l\u00f6f Arnalds]] is also a well-known singer/songwriter.\n\n\u00d3lafur is a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kim|first1=Jae-Ha|title=Go Away With \u2026 Olafur Arnalds|url=http://www.jaehakim.com/travel/go-away-with/go-away-with-%E2%80%A6-olafur-arnalds/|website=Jae-Ha Kim|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=18 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n\u00d3lafur's favourite classical composers are [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]], [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]], [[Shostakovich]] and [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]].<ref>https://www.alternativeclassical.co.uk/interviews/olafur-arnalds</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n* ''[[Eulogy for Evolution]]'' (2007)\n* ''...And They Have Escaped the Weight of Darkness'' (2010)\n* ''For Now I Am Winter'' (2013)\n* ''Re:member'' (2018)\n\n===EPs===\n* ''Variations of Static'' - EP (2008)\n* ''Only the Winds'' - EP (2013)\n\n===Singles===\n* \"Two Songs for Dance\" (2012)\n* \"Old Skin\" (2013)\n* \"Kinesthesis I\" (2016)\n* \"RGB\" (2016)\n* \"Re:member\" (2018)\n* \"Unfold\" (2018) {{small|(with [[Sohn (musician)|Sohn]])}}\n\n===Collections===\n* ''Found Songs'' (2009)\n* ''Living Room Songs'' (2011)\n* ''Island Songs'' (2016)\n\n===Soundtracks===\n* ''Dyad 1909'' (2009)\n* ''Blinky TM'' (2010)\n* ''Jitters'' (2010)\n* ''[[Another Happy Day]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Gimme Shelter (2013 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'' (2013)\n* ''Vonarstr\u00e6ti/Life in a Fishbowl'' (2014)\n* ''[[Broadchurch]]'' (2015)\n** \"Not Alone\" - Single (2015) from ''Broadchurch''\n\n===Collaborations===\n* ''A Hundred Reasons'' - Single (2010) with [[Haukur Hei\u00f0ar Hauksson]]\n* ''Stare'' - EP (2012) with [[Nils Frahm]]\n* ''The Chopin Project'' (2015) with [[Alice Sara Ott]]\n* ''So Far'' - Single (2015) with Viktor Orri \u00c1rnason, Laufey Jensd\u00f3ttir, Bj\u00f6rk Oskardsd\u00f3ttir, S\u00f3lveig Vaka Ey\u00fe\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir, Bjarni Fr\u00edmann Bjarnason & Hallgr\u00edmur J\u00f3nas Jensson\n* ''Life Story / Love and Glory'' - Single (2015) with [[Nils Frahm]]\n* ''Loon'' - EP (2015) with [[Nils Frahm]]\n* ''Trance Frendz'' (2016) with [[Nils Frahm]]\n* ''Say My Name'' - Single (2016) with [[Agent Fresco|Arn\u00f3r Dan]]\n\n===Mixtapes===\n* ''[[Late Night Tales]]: \u00d3lafur Arnalds'' (2016)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of ambient music artists]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}} \n* {{official website|http://olafurarnalds.com/}}\n* {{IMDb name|id=4263872}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arnalds, Olafur}}\n[[Category:1986 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Icelandic composers]]\n[[Category:Icelandic electronic musicians]]\n[[Category:Mercury KX artists]]\n[[Category:Television composers]]\n[[Category:Erased Tapes Records artists]]\n[[Category:Nettwerk Music Group artists]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the female singer|\u00d3l\u00f6f Arnalds}}\n{{Icelandic name|\u00d3lafur|surname}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name                = \u00d3lafur Arnalds\n| image               = Olafur Arnalds.jpg\n| alt                 = \u00d3lafur Arnalds in 2007\n| caption             = \u00d3lafur Arnalds in 2007\n| background          = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n| birth_date          = {{birth date and age|df=yes|1986|11|03}}\n| birth_place         = [[Mosfellsb\u00e6r]], [[Iceland]] \n| instrument          = Piano, drums, guitar, [[banjo]]\n| genre               = [[Film score]], [[classical music|classical]], [[Experimental music|experimental]], [[electronica]], [[Ambient music|ambient]]\n| occupation          = Musician, composer, record producer\n| years_active        = Early 2000s\u2013present\n| label               = [[Erased Tapes Records|Erased Tapes]], Mercury KX/Decca/[[Universal Classics]]\n| associated_acts     = [[Kiasmos]], [[Nils Frahm]], [[Alice Sara Ott]], Janus Rasmussen, [[Heaven Shall Burn]], \n| website             = {{url|olafurarnalds.com}}\n}}\n'''\u00d3lafur Arnalds''' ({{IPA-is|\u02c8ou\u02d0lav\u028fr \u02c8artnalts}};

The album featured his ground-breaking new musical system called Stratus. The Stratus Pianos are two self-playing, semi-generative player pianos which are triggered by a central piano played by Arnalds. The custom-built software was born out of two years of work by the composer and audio developer, Halldor Eldjarn.  As Arnalds plays a note on the piano, two different notes are generated by Stratus, creating unexpected harmonies and surprising melodic sequences. \n\nThe algorithms generated from Stratus were also used to create the album artwork. In an interview with ''[http://soundofboston.com/ Sound of Boston]'' Arnalds explains that the artist, Torsten Posselt from FELD studios, used the Stratus software as a starting point and made his own software that translated the same MIDI signals used for the music. Each dot corresponds to a piano note in the title track: 88 fields correspond to 88 notes; the thicker the dot, the higher the frequency of that note being played.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bedian |first1=Knar |title=Interview: \u00d3lafur Arnalds and Pianos That Go Bleep Bloop |url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-olafur-arnalds/ |website=Sound of Boston |publisher=Sound of Boston |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nList of tracks with collaborators:\n#\"re:member\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds) \n#\"unfold\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds & SOHN)\n#\"saman\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"brot\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"inconsist\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"they sink\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"ypsilon\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"partial\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"momentary\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"undir\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"ekki hugsa\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n#\"nyepi\" (\u00d3lafur Arnalds)\n\n==Personal life==\n\u00d3lafur's cousin [[\u00d3l\u00f6f Arnalds]] is also a well-known singer/songwriter.\n\n\u00d3lafur is a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kim|first1=Jae-Ha|title=Go Away With \u2026 Olafur Arnalds|url=http://www.jaehakim.com/travel/go-away-with/go-away-with-%E2%80%A6-olafur-arnalds/|website=Jae-Ha Kim|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=18 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n\u00d3lafur's favourite classical composers are [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]], [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]], [[Shostakovich]] and [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]].<ref>https://www.alternativeclassical.co.uk/interviews/olafur-arnalds</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n* ''[[Eulogy for Evolution]]'' (2007)\n* ''...And They Have Escaped the Weight of Darkness'' (2010)\n* ''For Now I Am Winter'' (2013)\n* ''Re:member'' (2018)\n\n===EPs===\n* ''Variations of Static'' - EP (2008)\n* ''Only the Winds'' - EP (2013)\n\n===Singles===\n* \"Two Songs for Dance\" (2012)\n* \"Old Skin\" (2013)\n* \"Kinesthesis I\" (2016)\n* \"RGB\" (2016)\n* \"Re:member\" (2018)\n* \"Unfold\" (2018) {{small|(with [[Sohn (musician)|Sohn]])}}\n\n===Collections===\n* ''Found Songs'' (2009)\n* ''Living Room Songs'' (2011)\n* ''Island Songs'' (2016)\n\n===Soundtracks===\n* ''Dyad 1909'' (2009)\n* ''Blinky TM'' (2010)\n* ''Jitters'' (2010)\n* ''[[Another Happy Day]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Gimme Shelter (2013 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'' (2013)\n* ''Vonarstr\u00e6ti/Life in a Fishbowl'' (2014)\n* ''[[Broadchurch]]'' (2015)\n** \"Not Alone\" - Single (2015) from ''Broadchurch''\n\n===Collaborations===\n* ''A Hundred Reasons'' - Single (2010) with [[Haukur Hei\u00f0ar Hauksson]]\n* ''Stare'' - EP (2012) with [[Nils Frahm]]\n* ''The Chopin Project'' (2015) with [[Alice Sara Ott]]\n* ''So Far'' - Single (2015) with Viktor Orri \u00c1rnason, Laufey Jensd\u00f3ttir, Bj\u00f6rk Oskardsd\u00f3ttir, S\u00f3lveig Vaka Ey\u00fe\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir, Bjarni Fr\u00edmann Bjarnason & Hallgr\u00edmur J\u00f3nas Jensson\n* ''Life Story / Love and Glory'' - Single (2015) with [[Nils Frahm]]\n* ''Loon'' - EP (2015) with [[Nils Frahm]]\n* ''Trance Frendz'' (2016) with [[Nils Frahm]]\n* ''Say My Name'' - Single (2016) with [[Agent Fresco|Arn\u00f3r Dan]]\n\n===Mixtapes===\n* ''[[Late Night Tales]]: \u00d3lafur Arnalds'' (2016)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of ambient music artists]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}} \n* {{official website|http://olafurarnalds.com/}}\n* {{IMDb name|id=4263872}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arnalds, Olafur}}\n[[Category:1986 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Icelandic composers]]\n[[Category:Icelandic electronic musicians]]\n[[Category:Mercury KX artists]]\n[[Category:Television composers]]\n[[Category:Erased Tapes Records artists]]\n[[Category:Nettwerk Music Group artists]]\n", "name_user": "Codenamevegetablesoup", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added early life section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93lafur_Arnalds"}

{"title_page": "Hosts (file)", "text_new": "{{other uses|Host (disambiguation)}}\n{{lowercase title}}\n\nThe [[computer file]' is an operating system file that maps [[hostname]]s to [[IP address]]es. It i file named HOSTS.TXT was manaintained and made available via file sharing by [[Stanford Research Institute]]membershipname=\"BIND Home Page\">{{cite web\n|url = http://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/\n|title = The Most Widely Used Name Server Software: BIND\n|author= Internet Systems Consortium\n|at = History of BIND\n|accessdate=2017-07-01\n}}</ref> automated the publication process and provided instantaneous and dynamic hostname resolution in the rapidly growing network. In modern operating systems, the hostsas either the primary method or as a fallback method.\n\n==Purpose==\nThe hosts file is one of several system facilities that assists in addressing network nodes in a computer network. It is a common part of an operating system's [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) implementation, and serves the function of translating human-friendly hostnames into numeric protocol addresses, called [[IP address]]es, that identify and locate a host in an IP network.\n\nIn some operating systems, the contents of the hosts file is used preferentially to other name resolution methods, such as the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), but many systems implement [[name service]] switches, e.g., [[nsswitch.conf]] for [[Linux]] and [[Unix]], to provide customization. Unlike remote DNS resolvers, the hosts file is under the direct control of the local computer's administrator.<ref>\"Cisco Networking Academy Program: First-Year Companion Guide\", Cisco Systems, Inc., 2002 (2nd Edition), page 676, {{ISBN|1-58713-025-4}}</ref>\n\n==File content==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}\nThe hosts file contains lines of text consisting of an [[IP address]] in the first text field followed by one or more host names. Each field is separated by white space&nbsp;\u2013 tabs are often preferred for historical reasons, but spaces are also used. Comment lines may be included; they are indicated by an octothorpe (#) in the first position of such lines. Entirely blank lines in the file are ignored. For example, a typical hosts file may contain the following:\n 127.0.0.1  localhost loopback\n ::1        localhost\nThis example only contains entries for the loopback addresses of the system and their host names, a typical default content of the hosts file. The example illustrates that an IP address may have multiple host names (''localhost'' and ''loopback''), and that a host name may be mapped to both [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] IP addresses, as shown on the first and second lines respectively.\n\n==Location in the file system==\nThe location of the hosts file in the [[file system]] hierarchy varies by operating system. It is usually named ''hosts'', without an extension.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Operating System\n! Version(s)\n!

Each network node maintained its own map of the network nodes as needed and assigned them names that were memorable to the users of the system.

It is a [[plain text]] file. Originally a file named HOSTS.TXT was manually maintained and made available via file sharing by [[Stanford Research Institute]] for the [[ARPANET]] membership, containing the hostnames and address of hosts as contributed for inclusion by member organizations. The [[Domain Name System]], first described in 1983 and implemented in 1984,<ref name=\"BIND Home Page\">{{cite web\n|url = http://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/\n|title = The Most Widely Used Name Server Software: BIND\n|author= Internet Systems Consortium\n|at = History of BIND\n|accessdate=2017-07-01\n}}</ref> automated the publication process and provided instantaneous and dynamic hostname resolution in the rapidly growing network. In modern operating systems, the hosts file remains an alternative name resolution mechanism, configurable often as part of facilities such as the [[Name Service Switch]] as either the primary method or as a fallback method.\n\n==Purpose==\nThe hosts file is one of several system facilities that assists in addressing network nodes in a computer network. It is a common part of an operating system's [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) implementation, and serves the function of translating human-friendly hostnames into numeric protocol addresses, called [[IP address]]es, that identify and locate a host in an IP network.\n\nIn some operating systems, the contents of the hosts file is used preferentially to other name resolution methods, such as the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), but many systems implement [[name service]] switches, e.g., [[nsswitch.conf]] for [[Linux]] and [[Unix]], to provide customization. Unlike remote DNS resolvers, the hosts file is under the direct control of the local computer's administrator.<ref>\"Cisco Networking Academy Program: First-Year Companion Guide\", Cisco Systems, Inc., 2002 (2nd Edition), page 676, {{ISBN|1-58713-025-4}}</ref>\n\n==File content==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}\nThe hosts file contains lines of text consisting of an [[IP address]] in the first text field followed by one or more host names. Each field is separated by white space&nbsp;\u2013 tabs are often preferred for historical reasons, but spaces are also used. Comment lines may be included; they are indicated by an octothorpe (#) in the first position of such lines. Entirely blank lines in the file are ignored. For example, a typical hosts file may contain the following:\n 127.0.0.1  localhost loopback\n ::1        localhost\nThis example only contains entries for the loopback addresses of the system and their host names, a typical default content of the hosts file. The example illustrates that an IP address may have multiple host names (''localhost'' and ''loopback''), and that a host name may be mapped to both [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] IP addresses, as shown on the first and second lines respectively.\n\n==Location in the file system==\nThe location of the hosts file in the [[file system]] hierarchy varies by operating system. It is usually named ''hosts'', without an extension.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Operating System\n! Version(s)\n!

These sections are considered vital elements of the constitution, which was developed between 1947 and 1949 by the Constituent  Assembly of India.\n\nThe [[Fundamental Rights in India|''Fundamental Rights'']] are defined as the basic [[human rights]] of all citizens. These rights, defined in Part III of the Constitution, applied irrespective of race, place of birth, religion, [[caste]], creed, or gender. They are enforceable by the courts, subject to specific restrictions. The [[Directive Principles of India|''Directive Principles of State Policy'']] are guidelines for the framing of laws by the government. These provisions, set out in Part IV of the Constitution, are not enforceable by the courts, but the principles on which they are based are fundamental guidelines for governance that the State is expected to apply in framing policies and passing laws.\n\nThe ''Fundamental Duties'\n'' are defined as the moral obligations of all citizens to help promote a spirit of patriotism and to uphold the unity of India. These duties set out in Part IV\u2013A of the Constitution, concern individuals and the nation. Like the Directive Principles, they are not enforceable by courts unless otherwise made enforceable by parliamentary law.\n{{Constitution of India}}\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Indian independence movement|Constituent Assembly of India|Constitution of India|India}}\nThe Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles had their origins in the [[India]]n independence movement, which strove to achieve the values of liberty and social welfare as the goals of an independent Indian state.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|p=50}}</ref> The development of constitutional rights in India was inspired by historical documents such as England's Bill of Rights, the [[United States Bill of Rights]] and [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|France's Declaration of the Rights of Man]].<ref>Tayal, B.B. & Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', p. A-23</ref> The demand for civil liberties formed an important part of the Indian independence movement, with one of the objectives of the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) being to end discrimination between the [[United Kingdom|British]] rulers and their Indian subjects. This demand was explicitly mentioned in resolutions adopted by the INC between 1917 and 1919.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|pp=52\u201353}}</ref> The demands articulated in these resolutions included granting to Indians the rights to equality before the law, free speech, trial by juries composed at least half of Indian members, political power, and equal terms for bearing arms as British citizens.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|p=53}}</ref>\n\nThe experiences of the Second World War, the unsatisfactory [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms]] of 1919, and the rise to prominence of [[M. K. Gandhi]] in the Indian independence movement marked a change in the attitude of its leaders towards articulating demands for civil rights. The focus shifted from demanding equality of status between Indians and the British to assuring liberty for all Indians.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|pp=53\u201354}}</ref> The Commonwealth of India Bill, drafted by [[Annie Beasant]] in 1925, specifically included demands for seven fundamental rights&nbsp;\u2013 individual liberty, [[freedom of conscience]], free expression of opinion, [[freedom of assembly]], non-discrimination on the ground of sex, free elementary education and free use of public spaces.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|p=54}}</ref> In 1927, the INC resolved to set up a committee to draft a \"Swaraj Constitution\" for India based on a declaration of rights that would provide safeguards against oppression. The 11-member committee, led by [[Motilal Nehru]], was constituted in 1928. Its report made a number of recommendations, including proposing guaranteed fundamental rights to all Indians. These rights resembled those of the [[American Constitution]] and those adopted by post-war European countries, and several of them were adopted from the 1925 Bill. Several of these provisions were later replicated in various parts of the Indian Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|pp=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, the [[Indian National Congress]], at its [[Karachi]] session, adopted a resolution committing itself to the defence of civil rights and economic freedom, with the stated objectives of putting an end to exploitation, providing social security and implementing land reforms. Other new rights proposed by the resolution were the prohibition of State titles, [[Universal suffrage|universal adult franchise]], the abolition of capital punishment and freedom of movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|p=56}}</ref> Drafted by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the resolution, which later formed the basis for some of the Directive Principles, placed the primary responsibility of carrying out social reform on the State, and marked the increasing influence of socialism and Gandhian philosophy on the independence movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> The final phase of the Independence movement saw a reiteration of the socialist principles of the 1930s, along with an increased focus on minority rights&nbsp;\u2013 which had become an issue of major political concern by then&nbsp;\u2013 which were published in the [[Tej Bahadur Sapru|Sapru Report]] in 1945. The report, apart from stressing on protecting the rights of minorities, also sought to prescribe a \"standard of conduct for the legislatures, government and the courts\".<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|p=57}}</ref>\n\nDuring the final stages of the [[British Raj]], the [[1946 Cabinet Mission to India]] proposed a Constituent Assembly to draft a Constitution for India as part of the process of transfer of power.<ref>{{harvnb|Basu|1993|p=15}}</ref> The Constituent Assembly of India, composed of indirectly elected representatives from the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British provinces]] and [[Princely state]]s, commenced its proceedings in December 1946, and completed drafting the Constitution of India by November 1949.<ref>{{harvnb|Basu|1993|p=19}}</ref> According to the Cabinet Mission plan, the Assembly was to have an Advisory Committee to advise it on the nature and extent of [[fundamental rights]], protection of minorities and administration of tribal areas. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee was constituted in January 1947 with 64 members, and from among these a twelve-member sub-committee on Fundamental Rights was appointed under the chairmanship of [[J.

A-23</ref> The demand for civil liberties formed an important part of the Indian independence movement, with one of the objectives of the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) being to end discrimination between the [[United Kingdom|British]] rulers and their Indian subjects. This demand was explicitly mentioned in resolutions adopted by the INC between 1917 and 1919.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|pp=52\u201353}}</ref> The demands articulated in these resolutions included granting to Indians the rights to equality before the law, free speech, trial by juries composed at least half of Indian members, political power, and equal terms for bearing arms as British citizens.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|p=53}}</ref>\n\nThe experiences of the Second World War, the unsatisfactory [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms]] of 1919, and the rise to prominence of [[M. K. Gandhi]] in the Indian independence movement marked a change in the attitude of its leaders towards articulating demands for civil rights. The focus shifted from demanding equality of status between Indians and the British to assuring liberty for all Indians.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|pp=53\u201354}}</ref> The Commonwealth of India Bill, drafted by [[Annie Beasant]] in 1925, specifically included demands for seven fundamental rights&nbsp;\u2013 individual liberty, [[freedom of conscience]], free expression of opinion, [[freedom of assembly]], non-discrimination on the ground of sex, free elementary education and free use of public spaces.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|p=54}}</ref> In 1927, the INC resolved to set up a committee to draft a \"Swaraj Constitution\" for India based on a declaration of rights that would provide safeguards against oppression. The 11-member committee, led by [[Motilal Nehru]], was constituted in 1928. Its report made a number of recommendations, including proposing guaranteed fundamental rights to all Indians. These rights resembled those of the [[American Constitution]] and those adopted by post-war European countries, and several of them were adopted from the 1925 Bill. Several of these provisions were later replicated in various parts of the Indian Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|pp=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, the [[Indian National Congress]], at its [[Karachi]] session, adopted a resolution committing itself to the defence of civil rights and economic freedom, with the stated objectives of putting an end to exploitation, providing social security and implementing land reforms. Other new rights proposed by the resolution were the prohibition of State titles, [[Universal suffrage|universal adult franchise]], the abolition of capital punishment and freedom of movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|p=56}}</ref> Drafted by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the resolution, which later formed the basis for some of the Directive Principles, placed the primary responsibility of carrying out social reform on the State, and marked the increasing influence of socialism and Gandhian philosophy on the independence movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> The final phase of the Independence movement saw a reiteration of the socialist principles of the 1930s, along with an increased focus on minority rights&nbsp;\u2013 which had become an issue of major political concern by then&nbsp;\u2013 which were published in the [[Tej Bahadur Sapru|Sapru Report]] in 1945. The report, apart from stressing on protecting the rights of minorities, also sought to prescribe a \"standard of conduct for the legislatures, government and the courts\".<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|p=57}}</ref>\n\nDuring the final stages of the [[British Raj]], the [[1946 Cabinet Mission to India]] proposed a Constituent Assembly to draft a Constitution for India as part of the process of transfer of power.<ref>{{harvnb|Basu|1993|p=15}}</ref> The Constituent Assembly of India, composed of indirectly elected representatives from the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British provinces]] and [[Princely state]]s, commenced its proceedings in December 1946, and completed drafting the Constitution of India by November 1949.<ref>{{harvnb|Basu|1993|p=19}}</ref> According to the Cabinet Mission plan, the Assembly was to have an Advisory Committee to advise it on the nature and extent of [[fundamental rights]], protection of minorities and administration of tribal areas. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee was constituted in January 1947 with 64 members, and from among these a twelve-member sub-committee on Fundamental Rights was appointed under the chairmanship of [[J. B. Kripalani]] in February 1947.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|pp=61\u201362}}</ref> The sub-committee drafted the Fundamental Rights and submitted its report to the Committee by April 1947, and later that month the Committee placed it before the Assembly, which debated and discussed the rights over the course of the following year, adopting the drafts of most of them by, December 1948.<ref>{{harvnb|Austin|1999|pp=62\u201363}}</ref> The drafting of the Fundamental Rights was influenced by the adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by the [[U.N.
