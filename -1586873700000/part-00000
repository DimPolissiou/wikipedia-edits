A personal diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and/or feelings, excluding comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience. Someone who keeps a diary is known as a [[list of diarists|diarist]]. Diaries undertaken for institutional purposes play a role in many aspects of human civilization, including government records (e.g. ''[[Hansard]]''), business [[ledger]]s, and military [[Service record|record]]s. In British English, the word may also denote [[diary (stationery)|a preprinted journal format]]. A diary is a collection of notes. \n\nToday the term is generally employed for personal diaries, normally intended to remain private or to have a limited circulation amongst friends or relatives. The word \"[[Journal (disambiguation)|journal]]\" may be sometimes used for \"diary,\" but generally a diary has (or intends to have) daily entries, whereas journal-writing can be less frequent.\n\nAlthough a diary may provide information for a [[memoir]], [[autobiography]] or [[biography]], it is generally written not with the intention of being published as it stands, but for the author's own use. In recent years, however, there is internal evidence in some diaries (e.g. those of [[Ned Rorem]], [[Alan Clark]], [[Tony Benn]] or [[Simon Gray]]) that they are written with eventual publication in mind, with the intention of self-vindication (pre- or posthumous), or simply for profit.\n\nBy extension the term '''diary''' is also used to mean a printed publication of a written diary; and may also refer to other terms of journal including electronic formats (e.g. [[blog]]s).\n\n==Etymology==\n{{wikt}}\nThe word ''diary'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''diarium'' (\"daily allowance,\" from ''dies'' \"day\").<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diary|title= Diary|dictionary= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref> The word ''journal'' comes from the same root (''diurnus'' \"of the day\") through [[Old French]] ''jurnal'' (modern [[French language|French]] for ''day'' is ''jour'').<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/journal?show=0&t=1341691218|title=Journal|dictionary= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest use of the word refers to a book in which a daily record was written was in [[Ben Jonson]]'s comedy ''[[Volpone]]'' in 1605.<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=diary&allowed_in_frame=0|title=Diary|dictionary= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe oldest extant diaries come from [[Middle East]]ern and [[East Asia]]n cultures, although the even earlier work ''To Myself'' (\u03a4\u1f70 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f11\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd), today known as the ''[[Meditations]]'', written in Greek by the Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the second half of the 2nd century AD, already displays many characteristics of a diary. [[Pillowbook]]s of [[Japan]]ese court ladies and [[Asia]]n travel journals offer some aspects of this genre of writing, although they rarely consist exclusively of diurnal records. The scholar [[Li Ao (philosopher)|Li Ao]] (9th century AD), for example, kept a diary of his journey through southern China.\n\nIn the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Near East]], [[Arabic literature|Arabic]] diaries were written from before the 10th century. The earliest surviving diary of this era which most resembles the modern diary was that of Ibn Banna' in the 11th century. His diary is the earliest known to be arranged in order of date (''ta'rikh'' in Arabic), very much like modern diaries.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Diary in Islamic Historiography: Some Notes|first=George|last=Makdisi|journal=History and Theory|volume=25|issue=2|date=May 1986|pages=173\u201385|doi=10.2307/2505304|postscript=<!--None-->|jstor=2505304}}</ref>\n\nThe precursors of the diary in the modern sense include daily notes of [[Christian mysticism|medieval mystics]], concerned mostly with inward emotions and outward events perceived as spiritually important (e.g. [[Elizabeth of Sch\u00f6nau]], [[Agnes Blannbekin]], and perhaps also, in the lost vernacular account of her visions, [[Beatrice of Nazareth]]).\n\nFrom the [[Renaissance]] on, some individuals wanted not only to record events, as in medieval chronicles and itineraries, but also to put down their own opinions and express their hopes and fears, without any intention to publish these notes. One of the early preserved examples is the anonymous ''Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris'' that covers the years 1405\u201349, giving subjective commentaries on the current events. Famous 14th- to 16th-century Renaissance examples, which appeared much later as books, were the diaries by the [[Florence|Florentines]] [[Buonaccorso Pitti]] and [[Gregorio Dati]] and the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Marino Sanuto the Younger]]. Here we find records of even less important everyday occurrences together with much reflection, emotional experience and personal impressions.\n\nIn 1908, the [[Smythson]] company created the first featherweight diary,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smythson.com/corporate-diaries|title=Smythson.com}}</ref> enabling diaries to be carried about.<ref>p.181 Moss, Victoria ''The Archivists'' ''In Style'' October 2012</ref>\n\n==Published diaries==\n[[Image:Samuel Pepys.jpg|155px|right|thumb|[[Samuel Pepys]]]]\n[[Image:200px-Faustina.jpg|155px|right|thumb|[[Faustina Kowalska]]]]\n\nMany diaries of notable figures have been published and form an important element of [[autobiography|autobiographical]] literature.\n\n[[Samuel Pepys]] (1633\u20131703) is the earliest diarist who is well known today; his diaries, preserved in [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], were first transcribed and published in 1825. Pepys was amongst the first who took the diary beyond mere business transaction notation, into the realm of the personal. Pepys' contemporary [[John Evelyn]] also kept a notable diary, and their works are among the most important [[primary source]]s for the [[English Restoration]] period, and consist of [[witness|eyewitness]] accounts of many great events, such as the [[Great Plague of London]], and the [[Great Fire of London]].\n\nThe practice of posthumous publication of diaries of literary and other notables began in the 19th century. As examples, the ''Grasmere Journal'' of [[Dorothy Wordsworth]] (1771\u20131855) was published in 1897; the Journals of [[Fanny Burney]] (1752\u20131840) were published in 1889; the diaries of [[Henry Crabb Robinson]] (1776\u20131867) were published in 1869.\n\nAmong important [[U.S. Civil War]] diaries are those of [[George Templeton Strong]], a [[New York City]] lawyer, and [[Mary Boykin Chesnut|Mary Chesnut]], the wife of a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer. The diary of [[Jemima Condict]], living in the area of what is now [[West Orange, New Jersey]], includes local observations of the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nSince the 19th century the publication of diaries by their authors has become commonplace &ndash; notably amongst politicians seeking justification but also amongst artists and litterateurs of all descriptions. Amongst late 20th-century British published political diaries, those of [[Richard Crossman]], [[Tony Benn]] and [[Alan Clark]] are representative, the latter being more indiscreet in the tradition of the diaries of [[Chips Channon]]. In Britain in the field of the arts notable diaries were published by [[James Lees-Milne]], [[Roy Strong]] and [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]]. [[Harold Nicolson]] in the mid-20th century covered both politics and the arts.\n\nOne of the most famous modern diaries, widely read and translated, is the posthumously published ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'' by [[Anne Frank]], who wrote it while in hiding during the German occupation of [[Amsterdam]] in the 1940s. [[Otto Frank]] edited his daughter's diary and arranged for its publication after the War. Many edits were made before the diary was published in other countries. This was due to the sexually explicit material, which also led to some libraries banning the book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/annefrank/section9.rhtml|title=SparkNotes: Diary of a Young Girl: March 14, 1944\u2013April 11, 1944|work=sparknotes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe writing of diaries was also often practiced from the 20th century onwards as a conscious act of self-exploration (of greater or lesser sincerity) &ndash; examples being the diaries of [[Carl Jung]], [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Ana\u00efs Nin]].<ref>This practice is explored in Tristine Rainer, ''The New Diary'', 1978.</ref> Among important diaries by 20th-century literary figures are those of [[Franz Kafka]], [[Edmund Wilson]] and the French writer Paul L\u00e9autaud (1872\u20131956). The self-reflective ''[[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul]]'' written by [[Faustina Kowalska|Saint Faustina]] contains accounts of her visions and conversations with Jesus.\n\nA strong psychological effect may arise from having an audience for one's self-expression, even if this is the book one writes in, only read by oneself \u2013 particularly in adversity. Anne Frank went so far as to address her diary as \"Kitty.\" [[Friedrich Kellner]], a court official in [[Nazi Germany]], thought of his diary as a weapon for any future fight against tyrants and terrorism, and named it \"Mein Widerstand,\" ''[[My Opposition]]''. [[Victor Klemperer]] was similarly concerned with recording for the future the tyrannies and hypocrisies of Nazi Germany and of its [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] successor state in his diaries. In none of these cases, however, did the authors anticipate early \u2013 or indeed any \u2013 publication.\n\n==Internet diaries==\n{{main article|Online diary|Blog}}\n\nAs [[internet]] access became commonly available, many people adopted it as another medium in which to chronicle their lives with the added dimension of an audience. The first [[online diary]] is thought to be Claudio Pinhanez's \"Open Diary,\" published at the [[MIT Media Lab]] website from 14 November 1994 until 1996.<ref>a [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027115535/http://geocities.com/pinhanez/open_diary/open_diary.htm copy] of his \"open diary\" is still in existence</ref> Other early online diarists include [[Justin Hall]], who began eleven years of personal [https://www.lugelo.com/ online diary]-writing in 1994,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/20/MNGBKBEJO01.DTL|title=Time to get a life \u2014 pioneer blogger Justin Hall bows out at 31|publisher=SFgate|date=20 February 2005|accessdate=9 June 2006 | first=Reyhan | last=Harmanci}}</ref> Carolyn Burke, who started publishing \"Carolyn's Diary\" on 3 January 1995,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diary.carolyn.org|title=Carolyn's Diary Museum|work=carolyn.org}}</ref> and Bryon Sutherland, who announced his diary ''The Semi-Existence of Bryon'' in a [[USENET]] newsgroup on 19 April 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.announce/browse_frm/thread/7a77561b5796150e/34c1097809c9529b#34c1097809c9529b|title= USENET announcement|work=google.com}}</ref>\n\nThe internet has also served as a way to bring previously unpublished diaries to the attention of historians and other readers, such as the diary of [[Michael Shiner]], a 19th-century slave who documented his life in Washington, D.C.<ref>[https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/d/diary-of-michael-shiner.html John G. Sharp,  \"The Diary of Michael Shiner Relating to the History of the Washington Navy Yard 1813-1869, ''Naval History and Heritage Command'', 2015, retrieved October 5, 2016]</ref>\n\nWeb-based services such as [[Open Diary]] (started in October 1998) and [[LiveJournal]] (January 1999) soon appeared to streamline and automate [[online publishing]], but growth in personal storytelling came with the emergence of [[blog]]s. While the format first focused on external links and topical commentary, widespread blogging tools were quickly used to create web journals.

A personal diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and/or feelings, excluding comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience. Someone who keeps a diary is known as a [[list of diarists|diarist]]. Diaries undertaken for institutional purposes play a role in many aspects of human civilization, including government records (e.g. ''[[Hansard]]''), business [[ledger]]s, and military [[Service record|record]]s. In British English, the word may also denote [[diary (stationery)|a preprinted journal format]]. A diary is a collection of notes. \n\nToday the term is generally employed for personal diaries, normally intended to remain private or to have a limited circulation amongst friends or relatives. The word \"[[Journal (disambiguation)|journal]]\" may be sometimes used for \"diary,\" but generally a diary has (or intends to have) daily entries, whereas journal-writing can be less frequent.\n\nAlthough a diary may provide information for a [[memoir]], [[autobiography]] or [[biography]], it is generally written not with the intention of being published as it stands, but for the author's own use. In recent years, however, there is internal evidence in some diaries (e.g. those of [[Ned Rorem]], [[Alan Clark]], [[Tony Benn]] or [[Simon Gray]]) that they are written with eventual publication in mind, with the intention of self-vindication (pre- or posthumous), or simply for profit.\n\nBy extension the term '''diary''' is also used to mean a printed publication of a written diary; and may also refer to other terms of journal including electronic formats (e.g. [[blog]]s).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''diary'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''diarium'' (\"daily allowance,\" from ''dies'' \"day\").<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diary|title= Diary|dictionary= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref> The word ''journal'' comes from the same root (''diurnus'' \"of the day\") through [[Old French]] ''jurnal'' (modern [[French language|French]] for ''day'' is ''jour'').<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/journal?show=0&t=1341691218|title=Journal|dictionary= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest use of the word refers to a book in which a daily record was written was in [[Ben Jonson]]'s comedy ''[[Volpone]]'' in 1605.<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=diary&allowed_in_frame=0|title=Diary|dictionary= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe oldest extant diaries come from [[Middle East]]ern and [[East Asia]]n cultures, although the even earlier work ''To Myself'' (\u03a4\u1f70 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f11\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd), today known as the ''[[Meditations]]'', written in Greek by the Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the second half of the 2nd century AD, already displays many characteristics of a diary. [[Pillowbook]]s of [[Japan]]ese court ladies and [[Asia]]n travel journals offer some aspects of this genre of writing, although they rarely consist exclusively of diurnal records. The scholar [[Li Ao (philosopher)|Li Ao]] (9th century AD), for example, kept a diary of his journey through southern China.\n\nIn the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Near East]], [[Arabic literature|Arabic]] diaries were written from before the 10th century. The earliest surviving diary of this era which most resembles the modern diary was that of Ibn Banna' in the 11th century. His diary is the earliest known to be arranged in order of date (''ta'rikh'' in Arabic), very much like modern diaries.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Diary in Islamic Historiography: Some Notes|first=George|last=Makdisi|journal=History and Theory|volume=25|issue=2|date=May 1986|pages=173\u201385|doi=10.2307/2505304|postscript=<!--None-->|jstor=2505304}}</ref>\n\nThe precursors of the diary in the modern sense include daily notes of [[Christian mysticism|medieval mystics]], concerned mostly with inward emotions and outward events perceived as spiritually important (e.g. [[Elizabeth of Sch\u00f6nau]], [[Agnes Blannbekin]], and perhaps also, in the lost vernacular account of her visions, [[Beatrice of Nazareth]]).\n\nFrom the [[Renaissance]] on, some individuals wanted not only to record events, as in medieval chronicles and itineraries, but also to put down their own opinions and express their hopes and fears, without any intention to publish these notes. One of the early preserved examples is the anonymous ''Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris'' that covers the years 1405\u201349, giving subjective commentaries on the current events. Famous 14th- to 16th-century Renaissance examples, which appeared much later as books, were the diaries by the [[Florence|Florentines]] [[Buonaccorso Pitti]] and [[Gregorio Dati]] and the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Marino Sanuto the Younger]]. Here we find records of even less important everyday occurrences together with much reflection, emotional experience and personal impressions.\n\nIn 1908, the [[Smythson]] company created the first featherweight diary,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smythson.com/corporate-diaries|title=Smythson.com}}</ref> enabling diaries to be carried about.<ref>p.181 Moss, Victoria ''The Archivists'' ''In Style'' October 2012</ref>\n\n==Published diaries==\n[[Image:Samuel Pepys.jpg|155px|right|thumb|[[Samuel Pepys]]]]\n[[Image:200px-Faustina.jpg|155px|right|thumb|[[Faustina Kowalska]]]]\n\nMany diaries of notable figures have been published and form an important element of [[autobiography|autobiographical]] literature.\n\n[[Samuel Pepys]] (1633\u20131703) is the earliest diarist who is well known today; his diaries, preserved in [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], were first transcribed and published in 1825. Pepys was amongst the first who took the diary beyond mere business transaction notation, into the realm of the personal. Pepys' contemporary [[John Evelyn]] also kept a notable diary, and their works are among the most important [[primary source]]s for the [[English Restoration]] period, and consist of [[witness|eyewitness]] accounts of many great events, such as the [[Great Plague of London]], and the [[Great Fire of London]].\n\nThe practice of posthumous publication of diaries of literary and other notables began in the 19th century. As examples, the ''Grasmere Journal'' of [[Dorothy Wordsworth]] (1771\u20131855) was published in 1897; the Journals of [[Fanny Burney]] (1752\u20131840) were published in 1889; the diaries of [[Henry Crabb Robinson]] (1776\u20131867) were published in 1869.\n\nAmong important [[U.S. Civil War]] diaries are those of [[George Templeton Strong]], a [[New York City]] lawyer, and [[Mary Boykin Chesnut|Mary Chesnut]], the wife of a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer. The diary of [[Jemima Condict]], living in the area of what is now [[West Orange, New Jersey]], includes local observations of the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nSince the 19th century the publication of diaries by their authors has become commonplace &ndash; notably amongst politicians seeking justification but also amongst artists and litterateurs of all descriptions. Amongst late 20th-century British published political diaries, those of [[Richard Crossman]], [[Tony Benn]] and [[Alan Clark]] are representative, the latter being more indiscreet in the tradition of the diaries of [[Chips Channon]]. In Britain in the field of the arts notable diaries were published by [[James Lees-Milne]], [[Roy Strong]] and [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]]. [[Harold Nicolson]] in the mid-20th century covered both politics and the arts.\n\nOne of the most famous modern diaries, widely read and translated, is the posthumously published ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'' by [[Anne Frank]], who wrote it while in hiding during the German occupation of [[Amsterdam]] in the 1940s. [[Otto Frank]] edited his daughter's diary and arranged for its publication after the War. Many edits were made before the diary was published in other countries. This was due to the sexually explicit material, which also led to some libraries banning the book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/annefrank/section9.rhtml|title=SparkNotes: Diary of a Young Girl: March 14, 1944\u2013April 11, 1944|work=sparknotes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe writing of diaries was also often practiced from the 20th century onwards as a conscious act of self-exploration (of greater or lesser sincerity) &ndash; examples being the diaries of [[Carl Jung]], [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Ana\u00efs Nin]].<ref>This practice is explored in Tristine Rainer, ''The New Diary'', 1978.</ref> Among important diaries by 20th-century literary figures are those of [[Franz Kafka]], [[Edmund Wilson]] and the French writer Paul L\u00e9autaud (1872\u20131956). The self-reflective ''[[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul]]'' written by [[Faustina Kowalska|Saint Faustina]] contains accounts of her visions and conversations with Jesus.\n\nA strong psychological effect may arise from having an audience for one's self-expression, even if this is the book one writes in, only read by oneself \u2013 particularly in adversity. Anne Frank went so far as to address her diary as \"Kitty.\" [[Friedrich Kellner]], a court official in [[Nazi Germany]], thought of his diary as a weapon for any future fight against tyrants and terrorism, and named it \"Mein Widerstand,\" ''[[My Opposition]]''. [[Victor Klemperer]] was similarly concerned with recording for the future the tyrannies and hypocrisies of Nazi Germany and of its [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] successor state in his diaries. In none of these cases, however, did the authors anticipate early \u2013 or indeed any \u2013 publication.\n\n==Internet diaries==\n{{main article|Online diary|Blog}}\n\nAs [[internet]] access became commonly available, many people adopted it as another medium in which to chronicle their lives with the added dimension of an audience. The first [[online diary]] is thought to be Claudio Pinhanez's \"Open Diary,\" published at the [[MIT Media Lab]] website from 14 November 1994 until 1996.<ref>a [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027115535/http://geocities.com/pinhanez/open_diary/open_diary.htm copy] of his \"open diary\" is still in existence</ref> Other early online diarists include [[Justin Hall]], who began eleven years of personal [https://www.lugelo.com/ online diary]-writing in 1994,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/20/MNGBKBEJO01.DTL|title=Time to get a life \u2014 pioneer blogger Justin Hall bows out at 31|publisher=SFgate|date=20 February 2005|accessdate=9 June 2006 | first=Reyhan | last=Harmanci}}</ref> Carolyn Burke, who started publishing \"Carolyn's Diary\" on 3 January 1995,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diary.carolyn.org|title=Carolyn's Diary Museum|work=carolyn.org}}</ref> and Bryon Sutherland, who announced his diary ''The Semi-Existence of Bryon'' in a [[USENET]] newsgroup on 19 April 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.announce/browse_frm/thread/7a77561b5796150e/34c1097809c9529b#34c1097809c9529b|title= USENET announcement|work=google.com}}</ref>\n\nThe internet has also served as a way to bring previously unpublished diaries to the attention of historians and other readers, such as the diary of [[Michael Shiner]], a 19th-century slave who documented his life in Washington, D.C.<ref>[https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/d/diary-of-michael-shiner.html John G. Sharp,  \"The Diary of Michael Shiner Relating to the History of the Washington Navy Yard 1813-1869, ''Naval History and Heritage Command'', 2015, retrieved October 5, 2016]</ref>\n\nWeb-based services such as [[Open Diary]] (started in October 1998) and [[LiveJournal]] (January 1999) soon appeared to streamline and automate [[online publishing]], but growth in personal storytelling came with the emergence of [[blog]]s. While the format first focused on external links and topical commentary, widespread blogging tools were quickly used to create web journals. Recent advances have also been made to enable the privacy of internet diary entries.

The war resulted from King John's refusal to accept and abide by ''[[Magna Carta]]'', which he had sealed on 15 June 1215.\n\nAfter John's death the ambitions of the French crown prince Louis to be King of England meant that many of the rebels switched sides and the war dragged on. The war ended after French defeats at [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Lincoln]] and [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Sandwich]] in 1217 and Louis was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Lambeth]]. This formalised the end of the civil war and the departure of the French from England.<ref name=\"A&I\">Arlidge & Judge p. 19</ref>\n\n==Background==\nKing John in June 1215 was forced to put his seal to \"The Articles of the Barons\" by a group of powerful barons who could no longer stand John's failed leadership and despotic rule. The king's [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] was attached to it on 15 June 1215. In return, the barons renewed their oaths of fealty to King John on 19 July 1215. A formal document to record the agreement was created by the royal chancery on 15 July: this was the original ''[[Magna Carta]]''. \"The law of the land\" is one of the great watchwords of ''Magna Carta'', standing in opposition to the king's mere will.\n\nThe ''Magna Carta'' of 1215 contained clauses which in theory noticeably reduced the power of the king, such as clause 61, the \"security clause\". This clause allowed a group of 25 barons to override the king at any time by way of force,{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=189}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=261\u201362}} a medieval legal process called ''[[distraint]]'' that was normal in feudal relationships but had never been applied to a king. After a few months of half-hearted attempts to negotiate in the summer of 1215, open warfare broke out between the rebel barons and the king and his supporters.\n\n==Course of events==\n===Louis invited and welcomed===\nThe war began over ''Magna Carta'' but quickly turned into a dynastic war for the throne of England. The rebel barons, faced with a powerful king, turned to [[Louis VIII of France|Louis]], son and heir apparent of King [[Philip II of France]] and grandson-in-law of King [[Henry II of England]]. The [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] had occurred only 149 years before, and the relationship between England and France was not so simply adversarial as it later became.  The contemporary document called the [[annals of Waverley]] sees no contradiction in stating that Louis was invited to invade in order to \"prevent the realm being pillaged by aliens.\"\n\nAt first, in November 1215, Louis simply sent the barons a contingent of knights to protect London. However, even at that stage he also agreed to an open invasion, despite discouragement from his father and from [[Pope Innocent III]]. This came in May 1216, when watchmen on the coast of [[Isle of Thanet|Thanet]] detected sails on the horizon, and on the next day, the King of England and his armies saw Louis's troops disembark on the coast of [[Kent]].\n\nJohn decided to escape to the Saxon capital of [[Winchester]], and so Louis had little resistance on his march to London.  He entered London, also with little resistance, and was openly received by the rebel barons and citizens of London and proclaimed (though not crowned) king at [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]]. Many nobles gathered to give homage to him, including [[Alexander II of Scotland]], who held [[fiefs]] in England.\n\nMany of John's supporters, sensing a tide of change, moved to support the barons. [[Gerald of Wales]] remarked:  \"The madness of slavery is over, the time of liberty has been granted, English necks are free from the yoke.\"\n\nIn pursuit of John, Louis led his army south from London on 6 June, arriving the following day in [[Reigate]] where he found the [[Reigate Castle|castle]] abandoned. He moved onwards to [[Guildford Castle]] on 8 June, which surrendered immediately. [[Farnham Castle]] initially closed its gates, but then it too surrendered as the French started to lay siege. He only met resistance when he reached [[Winchester Castle]] on 14 June \u2013 it fell after a ten day siege. Louis' campaign continued and by July about a third of England was under his control.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guildford-dragon.com/2016/06/10/guildford-castle-fell-invading-french-800-years-ago-week/|title=When Guildford Castle Fell To The Invading French 800 Years Ago This Week|last=Morgan|first=Gavin|date=10 June 2016|website=The Guildford Dragon|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===First siege of Dover===\nIn the meantime, the [[Philip II of France|King of France]] taunted his son for trying to conquer England without first seizing its key port; Dover. The royal castles at [[Canterbury Castle|Canterbury]] and [[Rochester Castle|Rochester]], their towns, and indeed, most of Kent had already fallen to Louis but when he did move on to [[Dover Castle]] on 25 July it was prepared. Its constable, [[Hubert de Burgh]], had a well-supplied garrison of men.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe first [[siege]] began on 19 July, with Louis taking the high ground to the north of the castle. His men successfully undermined the [[barbican]] and attempted to topple the castle gate, but De Burgh's men managed to repel the invaders, blocking the breach in the walls with giant timbers.  (After the siege the weak northern gate was blocked and tunnels were built in that area, to St John's Tower, and the new Constable's Gate and Fitzwilliam's Gate.)  In the meantime Louis's occupation of Kent was being undermined by a guerrilla force of [[Weald]]en archers raised and led by [[William of Cassingham]].\n\nAfter three months spent besieging the castle, and with a large part of his forces diverted by the siege, Louis called a truce on 14 October and soon after returned to London.\n\n===Sieges of Windsor and Rochester===\nApart from Dover, the only castle to hold out against Louis was that at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]], where 60 loyalist knights survived a two-month siege, despite severe damage to the structure of its lower ward (immediately repaired in 1216 by Henry III, who further strengthened the defences with the construction of the western curtain wall, much of which survives today).  This is possibly due to its having been already besieged by the barons in 1189, less than 30 years earlier.\n\nIn 1206, John had spent \u00a3115{{efn|{{Inflation|UK|115|1209|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}} money.}} on repairs to [[Rochester Castle]], and he had even preemptively held it during the year of the negotiations leading up to ''[[Magna Carta]]'', but the Charter's terms had forced him to hand it back into the custody of [[Stephen Langton]], Archbishop of Canterbury, in May 1215. The rebel barons had then sent troops under [[William d'Aubigny (rebel)|William d'Aubigny]] to the castle, to whom its constable [[Reginald de Cornhill]] opened the castle's gates. Thus, during October 1215 on his marching from Dover to London, John found Rochester in his way and on 11 October began besieging it in person.\n\nThe rebels were expecting reinforcements from London but John sent [[fire ship]]s out to burn their route in, the city's bridge over the Medway.  [[Robert Fitzwalter]] rode out to stop the king, fighting his way onto the bridge but eventually being beaten back into the castle. John also sacked the [[Rochester Cathedral|cathedral]], took anything of value and stabled his horses in it, all as a slight to Langton.  Orders were then sent to the men of Canterbury.\n\nFive siege engines were then erected and work carried out to undermine the curtain wall.  By one of these means the king's forces entered and held the [[Bailey (fortification)|bailey]] in early November, and began attempting the same tactics against the keep, including undermining the south-east tower. The mine-roof was supported by wooden props, which were then set alight using pig-fat. On 25 November 1215 John had sent a writ to the [[justiciar]]s saying \"Send to us with all speed by day and night, forty of the fattest pigs of the sort least good for eating so that we may bring fire beneath the castle\".<ref>Contemporary source quoted in Salter (2000).</ref> The fire thus created caused one entire corner of the keep to collapse. The rebels withdrew behind the keep's [[cross-wall]] but still managed to hold out. A few were allowed to leave the castle but on John's orders had their hands and feet lopped off as an example.\n\nWinter was now setting in, and the castle was taken on 30 November by starvation and not by force.  John set up a memorial to the pigs and a gallows with the intention of hanging the whole garrison, but one of his captains ([[Savari de Maul\u00e9on]]) persuaded him not to hang the rebels since hanging those who had surrendered would set a precedent if John ever surrendered&nbsp;\u2013 only one man was actually hanged (a young bowman who had previously been in John's service).  The remainder of the rebel barons were taken away and imprisoned at various royal-held castles, such as [[Corfe Castle]].  Of the siege, the [[Barnwell chronicler]] wrote \"No one alive can remember a siege so fiercely pressed and so manfully resisted\" and that, after it, \"There were few who would put their trust in castles\".\n\n[[File:Rochester Castle, Kent - geograph.org.uk - 1582414.jpg|thumb|right|The round tower (centre) and two square towers (left and right) of [[Rochester Castle]].]]\n\n===Death of King John===\nOn 18 October 1216, John contracted [[dysentery]], which would ultimately prove fatal.<ref name=Handbook37>Fryde, Greenway, Porter and Roy, p.37.</ref><ref>Warren, pp.254\u20135.</ref> He died at [[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]], Nottinghamshire, and with him the main reason for the fighting. Louis now seemed much more of a threat to baronial interests than John's nine-year-old son, Prince Henry.

London was held by Louis (it was his seat of government) and therefore could not be used for this coronation so, on 28 October 1216, they brought the boy from the castle at [[Devizes]] to [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester Abbey]] in front of a small attendance presided over by a [[Papal Legate]], [[Guala Bicchieri]] (d. 1227, [[Bishop of Vercelli]], papal legate in England 1216\u201318). They crowned Henry with a necklace of gold.\n\nOn 12 November 1216 ''Magna Carta'' was reissued in Henry's name with some of the clauses omitted, including clause 61. The revised charter was sealed by the young king's [[regent]] [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]].  A great deal of the country was loyal to Prince Louis, with the southwest of England and the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] favouring Henry. Marshal was highly respected and he asked the barons not to blame the child Henry for his father's sins. The prevailing sentiment, helped by self-interest, disliked the idea of depriving a boy of his inheritance. Marshal also promised that he and the other regents would rule by ''Magna Carta''. Furthermore, he managed to get support from the Pope, who had already excommunicated Louis.\n\n===Louis's losses===\n{{See also|History of the Royal Navy#Norman and Medieval, to 1485|l1=History of the Royal Navy}}\n[[File:BitvaLincoln1217.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Second Battle of Lincoln]] in 1217.]]\nWilliam Marshal slowly managed to get most barons to switch sides from Louis to Henry and attack Louis. The two opposing sides fought for about a year. On 6 December 1216 Louis took [[Hertford Castle]] but allowed the defending knights to leave with their horses and weapons. He then took [[Berkhamsted Castle]] in late December, again allowing the royal garrison to withdraw honourably with their horses and weapons.\n\nBy early 1217, Louis decided to return to France for reinforcements. He had to fight his way to the south coast through loyalist resistance in Kent and Sussex, losing part of his force in an ambush at [[Lewes]], with the remainder pursued to [[Winchelsea]] and were only saved from starvation by the arrival of a French fleet.\n\nSince the truce had been arranged with Dover, the Dover garrison had repeatedly disrupted Louis's communication with France, and so Louis sailed back to Dover to begin a second siege.  The French camp set up outside Dover Castle in anticipation of the new siege was attacked and burned by [[William of Cassingham]] just as the fleet carrying the reinforcements arrived. Louis was forced to land at [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]] and march to Dover, where he began a second siege in earnest on 12 May 1217.  This new siege diverted so much of Louis's forces that Marshal and [[Falkes de Breaut\u00e9]] were able to attack and heavily defeat pro-Louis barons at [[Lincoln Castle]] on 15 May or 20 May 1217, in what became known as the [[Second Battle of Lincoln]].\n\nMarshal prepared for a siege against London next. In the meantime, Louis suffered two more heavy defeats, this time at sea, at the [[Battle of Dover (1217)|Battle of Dover]] and [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]] in the [[Straits of Dover]], this time at the hands of William's ally and Dover's constable [[Hubert de Burgh]].

The war resulted from King John's refusal to accept and abide by ''[[Magna Carta]]'', which he had sealed on 15 June 1215.\n\nAfter John's death the ambitions of the French crown prince Louis to be King of England meant that many of the rebels switched sides and the war dragged on. The war ended after French defeats at [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Lincoln]] and [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Sandwich]] in 1217 and Louis was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Lambeth]]. This formalised the end of the civil war and the departure of the French from England.<ref name=\"A&I\">Arlidge & Judge p. 19</ref>\n\n==Background==\nKing John in June 1215 was forced to put his seal to \"The Articles of the Barons\" by a group of powerful barons who could no longer stand John's failed leadership and despotic rule. The king's [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] was attached to it on 15 June 1215. In return, the barons renewed their oaths of fealty to King John on 19 July 1215. A formal document to record the agreement was created by the royal chancery on 15 July: this was the original ''[[Magna Carta]]''. \"The law of the land\" is one of the great watchwords of ''Magna Carta'', standing in opposition to the king's mere will.\n\nThe ''Magna Carta'' of 1215 contained clauses which in theory noticeably reduced the power of the king, such as clause 61, the \"security clause\". This clause allowed a group of 25 barons to override the king at any time by way of force,{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=189}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=261\u201362}} a medieval legal process called ''[[distraint]]'' that was normal in feudal relationships but had never been applied to a king. After a few months of half-hearted attempts to negotiate in the summer of 1215, open warfare broke out between the rebel barons and the king and his supporters.\n\n==Course of events==\n===Louis invited and welcomed===\nThe war began over ''Magna Carta'' but quickly turned into a dynastic war for the throne of England. The rebel barons, faced with a powerful king, turned to [[Louis VIII of France|Louis]], son and heir apparent of King [[Philip II of France]] and grandson-in-law of King [[Henry II of England]]. The [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] had occurred only 149 years before, and the relationship between England and France was not so simply adversarial as it later became.  The contemporary document called the [[annals of Waverley]] sees no contradiction in stating that Louis was invited to invade in order to \"prevent the realm being pillaged by aliens.\"\n\nAt first, in November 1215, Louis simply sent the barons a contingent of knights to protect London. However, even at that stage he also agreed to an open invasion, despite discouragement from his father and from [[Pope Innocent III]]. This came in May 1216, when watchmen on the coast of [[Isle of Thanet|Thanet]] detected sails on the horizon, and on the next day, the King of England and his armies saw Louis's troops disembark on the coast of [[Kent]].\n\nJohn decided to escape to the Saxon capital of [[Winchester]], and so Louis had little resistance on his march to London.  He entered London, also with little resistance, and was openly received by the rebel barons and citizens of London and proclaimed (though not crowned) king at [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]]. Many nobles gathered to give homage to him, including [[Alexander II of Scotland]], who held [[fiefs]] in England.\n\nMany of John's supporters, sensing a tide of change, moved to support the barons. [[Gerald of Wales]] remarked:  \"The madness of slavery is over, the time of liberty has been granted, English necks are free from the yoke.\"\n\nIn pursuit of John, Louis led his army south from London on 6 June, arriving the following day in [[Reigate]] where he found the [[Reigate Castle|castle]] abandoned. He moved onwards to [[Guildford Castle]] on 8 June, which surrendered immediately. [[Farnham Castle]] initially closed its gates, but then it too surrendered as the French started to lay siege. He only met resistance when he reached [[Winchester Castle]] on 14 June \u2013 it fell after a ten day siege. Louis' campaign continued and by July about a third of England was under his control.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guildford-dragon.com/2016/06/10/guildford-castle-fell-invading-french-800-years-ago-week/|title=When Guildford Castle Fell To The Invading French 800 Years Ago This Week|last=Morgan|first=Gavin|date=10 June 2016|website=The Guildford Dragon|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===First siege of Dover===\nIn the meantime, the [[Philip II of France|King of France]] taunted his son for trying to conquer England without first seizing its key port; Dover. The royal castles at [[Canterbury Castle|Canterbury]] and [[Rochester Castle|Rochester]], their towns, and indeed, most of Kent had already fallen to Louis but when he did move on to [[Dover Castle]] on 25 July it was prepared. Its constable, [[Hubert de Burgh]], had a well-supplied garrison of men.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe first [[siege]] began on 19 July, with Louis taking the high ground to the north of the castle. His men successfully undermined the [[barbican]] and attempted to topple the castle gate, but De Burgh's men managed to repel the invaders, blocking the breach in the walls with giant timbers.  (After the siege the weak northern gate was blocked and tunnels were built in that area, to St John's Tower, and the new Constable's Gate and Fitzwilliam's Gate.)  In the meantime Louis's occupation of Kent was being undermined by a guerrilla force of [[Weald]]en archers raised and led by [[William of Cassingham]].\n\nAfter three months spent besieging the castle, and with a large part of his forces diverted by the siege, Louis called a truce on 14 October and soon after returned to London.\n\n===Sieges of Windsor and Rochester===\nApart from Dover, the only castle to hold out against Louis was that at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]], where 60 loyalist knights survived a two-month siege, despite severe damage to the structure of its lower ward (immediately repaired in 1216 by Henry III, who further strengthened the defences with the construction of the western curtain wall, much of which survives today).  This is possibly due to its having been already besieged by the barons in 1189, less than 30 years earlier.\n\nIn 1206, John had spent \u00a3115{{efn|{{Inflation|UK|115|1209|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}} money.}} on repairs to [[Rochester Castle]], and he had even preemptively held it during the year of the negotiations leading up to ''[[Magna Carta]]'', but the Charter's terms had forced him to hand it back into the custody of [[Stephen Langton]], Archbishop of Canterbury, in May 1215. The rebel barons had then sent troops under [[William d'Aubigny (rebel)|William d'Aubigny]] to the castle, to whom its constable [[Reginald de Cornhill]] opened the castle's gates. Thus, during October 1215 on his marching from Dover to London, John found Rochester in his way and on 11 October began besieging it in person.\n\nThe rebels were expecting reinforcements from London but John sent [[fire ship]]s out to burn their route in, the city's bridge over the Medway.  [[Robert Fitzwalter]] rode out to stop the king, fighting his way onto the bridge but eventually being beaten back into the castle. John also sacked the [[Rochester Cathedral|cathedral]], took anything of value and stabled his horses in it, all as a slight to Langton.  Orders were then sent to the men of Canterbury.\n\nFive siege engines were then erected and work carried out to undermine the curtain wall.  By one of these means the king's forces entered and held the [[Bailey (fortification)|bailey]] in early November, and began attempting the same tactics against the keep, including undermining the south-east tower. The mine-roof was supported by wooden props, which were then set alight using pig-fat. On 25 November 1215 John had sent a writ to the [[justiciar]]s saying \"Send to us with all speed by day and night, forty of the fattest pigs of the sort least good for eating so that we may bring fire beneath the castle\".<ref>Contemporary source quoted in Salter (2000).</ref> The fire thus created caused one entire corner of the keep to collapse. The rebels withdrew behind the keep's [[cross-wall]] but still managed to hold out. A few were allowed to leave the castle but on John's orders had their hands and feet lopped off as an example.\n\nWinter was now setting in, and the castle was taken on 30 November by starvation and not by force.  John set up a memorial to the pigs and a gallows with the intention of hanging the whole garrison, but one of his captains ([[Savari de Maul\u00e9on]]) persuaded him not to hang the rebels since hanging those who had surrendered would set a precedent if John ever surrendered&nbsp;\u2013 only one man was actually hanged (a young bowman who had previously been in John's service).  The remainder of the rebel barons were taken away and imprisoned at various royal-held castles, such as [[Corfe Castle]].  Of the siege, the [[Barnwell chronicler]] wrote \"No one alive can remember a siege so fiercely pressed and so manfully resisted\" and that, after it, \"There were few who would put their trust in castles\".\n\n[[File:Rochester Castle, Kent - geograph.org.uk - 1582414.jpg|thumb|right|The round tower (centre) and two square towers (left and right) of [[Rochester Castle]].]]\n\n===Death of King John===\nOn 18 October 1216, John contracted [[dysentery]], which would ultimately prove fatal.<ref name=Handbook37>Fryde, Greenway, Porter and Roy, p.37.</ref><ref>Warren, pp.254\u20135.</ref> He died at [[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]], Nottinghamshire, and with him the main reason for the fighting. Louis now seemed much more of a threat to baronial interests than John's nine-year-old son, Prince Henry. [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor of Brittany]], the grown daughter of John's late elder brother [[Geoffrey II of Brittany|Geoffrey]], might pose another potential candidate for the crown, but she had been imprisoned by John since 1202, and the barons ignored her claim.\n\n[[Pierre des Roches]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], and a number of barons rushed to have the young Henry be crowned as King of England.

He was [[Secretary of State for War]] between 1905 and 1912 during which time the \"[[Haldane Reforms]]\" of the British Army were implemented. Raised to the peerage as [[Viscount Haldane]] in 1911, he was [[Lord Chancellor]] between 1912 and 1915, when he was forced to resign because of false allegations of German sympathies. He later joined the Labour Party and once again served as Lord Chancellor in 1924 in the first ever Labour administration. Apart from his legal and political careers, Haldane was also an influential writer on philosophy, in recognition of which he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1914.\n\n==Background and education==\nHaldane was born at 17 [[Charlotte Square]], Edinburgh, the son of Robert Haldane and his wife Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Burdon-Sanderson. He was the grandson of the Scottish evangelist [[James Alexander Haldane]], the brother of respiratory [[physiologist]] [[John Scott Haldane]], [[William Haldane|Sir William Haldane]] and author [[Elizabeth Haldane]], and the uncle of [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Naomi Mitchison]].\n\nHe received his first education at the [[Edinburgh Academy]], and then at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. He gained a first and MA at [[University of Edinburgh]]<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\" /> where he received first-class honours in Philosophy and as Gray scholar and Ferguson scholar in philosophy of the four Scottish Universities.\n\nAfter studying law in London, he was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] by [[Lincoln's Inn]], in 1879,<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/> and became a successful lawyer. He was taken on at 5 New Square Chambers by [[Horace Davey, Baron Davey|Lord Davey]] in 1882 as the junior.  Haldane's practice was a specialism in [[conveyancing]]; a particular skill for pleadings at appeal and tribunal cases, bringing cases to the privy council and house of Lords.  By 1890 he had become a [[Queen's Counsel]].<ref name=\"LG26018\" /> By 1905 he was earning [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]20,000 per annum at the Bar{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} ({{Inflation|index=UK|currsign=\u00a3|value=20000|start_year=1905|fmt=eq|r=-5}}). He became a [[bencher]] at Lincoln's Inn in 1893.  Amongst his early friends was [[Edmund Gosse]], the scholarly librarian at the inn's law library, whose help made Haldane well known for being fully prepared in court and parliamentary briefs.\n\nHaldane was a deep thinker, an unusual breed: a philosopher-politician.  During his stay at G\u00f6ttingen he expanded an interest in the German philosophers, Schopenhauer and Hegel.  He had refused a place at Balliol, but in nodding respect for the Master and philosopher, [[Thomas Hill Green|T H Green]], he dedicated his Schopenhauer translation ''The World as Will and Idea'' which he carried through with a friend, [[Peter Hume Brown]], the Scottish historian.\n\n==Early political career==\nA cousin, the Whig politician [[Robert Adam Philips Haldane Haldane-Duncan, 3rd Earl of Camperdown|Lord Camperdown]] encouraged the young barrister into standing as a Liberal at the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|General Election of 1880]]. Although not elected that year Haldane joined the [[Eighty Club]], a political dining and discussion club formed in 1879. Membership was restricted to Liberals under the age of forty. In 1881 Haldane met [[H. H. Asquith]], and they soon became firm friends often meeting the Blue Post Public house on Cork Street. They were founders of the Albert Grey committee, named after Earl Grey, regularly discussing burning social issues, such as education.\n\nIn November 1885 Haldane was elected [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament for [[Haddingtonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Haddingtonshire]], a seat he held until 1911.<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/><ref name=\"leighrayment.com\" /> The philosopher-politician wrote several articles for the advanced and progressive ''Contemporary Review''.  In October 1888, \"The Liberal Creed\" was published summarising his belief in the direction of New Liberalism.  In the 1890 article  \"The Eight Hours Question\" Haldane rejected the idea of the eight-hour day.  In 1888, he courted Emma Valentine Ferguson, sister of his Liberal party friend, [[Ronald Munro-Ferguson]]; she broke off the engagement and subsequently lampooned him in her novel ''Betsy'' in 1892.  Haldane became firmly ensconced in the Imperialist wing of Liberalism, led by Sir Edward Grey.  At the 1892 General Election, he received a shock when nearly defeated by the Liberal Unionist Master of Polwarth. [[Beatrice Webb]], the socialist who was a close intimate, remarked on how alone Haldane was in the world.{{sfn|Webb|1948|p=98}} Haldane added the preface to [[L T Hobhouse]]'s ''The Labour Movement'' in 1893.  Sadly Emma Ferguson died insane in 1897.  ''He had pathos in his personality'', remarked Webb, ''a successful lawyer tinged with socialism''.{{sfn|Webb|1986|p=345}}\n\n===Liberal Imperialist===\nFocusing on his writings, Haldane was passed over for political office, being the only one of his group left out in the wilderness.  Haldane remained an ally of Asquith and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] in the [[Liberal Imperialist]] wing of the party, followers of Lord Rosebery rather than of Sir William Harcourt. Rosebery admired Haldane's intellect, and the Scotsman urged upon his friend, whom he had known since 1886, an assault on Tory power in the Lords in 1894.<ref name=\"Rosebery\" />  Haldane joined friends at the Articles Club, including Asquith and Grey. Haldane was disappointed having failed to secure the post of Solicitor-General in October 1894. At the time, Asquith wryly remarked, ''A very wrong decision come to upon inadequate grounds.''{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|p= 335}} Haldane was sounded out of the Speakership by Rosebery, but refused it, declaring it to be a political death. The post went eventually to W Gully in 1895.\n\nAt a meeting with [[Beatrice Webb]], the Fabian socialist, Haldane told her he was disconsolate at the condition of the Liberal Party: \"Rot has set in there is no hope now but to be beaten and then reconstruct a new party\".{{efn|Diary of Beatrice Webb, 20 January 1895,<ref name=\"Passfield Papers\" /> cited in {{harvnb|McKinstry|2005|pp= 338-339}} }} The leaders of the party were exasperated and believed Rosebery to lack planning and direction. \"Although Asquith, Grey and I\", wrote Haldane, \"stuck by him... we never knew when he would retire and leave us in the lurch\".{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc=Note to his letters}} When Rosebery offered the Speakership, he refused it that March.{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc= Mss NLS 5951}} However, on 11 October 1896, he wrote to Rosebery that he \"was the leader of a revolution in our party\".{{sfn|Matthew|2011}}\n\nOn 11 August 1902, Haldane was admitted to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]],<ref name=\"LG27464\" /> following an announcement of the King's intention to make the appointment in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list, published in June that year.<ref name=\"TheTimes1902\" /> The King used his influence and charm to cultivate allies, bringing cross-party groups like [[The Souls]] together in consensual amity.{{sfn|Ridley|2012|p=}} Balfour's administration leant on Haldane's philosophy for educational reforms.\n\nAfter the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Arthur Balfour]] fell in December 1905 there was some speculation that Asquith and his allies Haldane and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] would refuse to serve unless Campbell-Bannerman accepted a peerage, which would have left Asquith as the real leader in the House of Commons. Haldane had suggested involving the King at Balmoral to 'kick CB upstairs'.{{sfn|Ridley|2012|pp=397-398}}However, the plot (called \"[[The Relugas Compact]]\" after Grey's Scottish lodge where the men met) collapsed when Asquith agreed to serve as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under Campbell-Bannerman.{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|pp=467-468}}\n\nHaldane wrote, \"One longs for Rosebery had he been coming in to his right place at the head of affairs, we could have gone anywhere with confidence. But it seems now as if this were not to be and we have to do the only thing we can do, which is to resolutely follow a plan of concerted action\".{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc=Letter from Lord Haldane to Sir Francis Knollys, Private Secretary to Edward VII on 12 September 1905}}\n\nOn 13 December 1905, Haldane was appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], but he may have been offered the jobs of Attorney-General and Home Secretary.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} (Grey became Foreign Secretary).<ref name=\"LG27862\" /> Unity in the Liberals helped them obtain the largest electoral majority in the party's history in the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|p= 476}}\n\n==Secretary of State for War==\nAs early as January 1906 Haldane was persuaded by fellow Liberal Imperialist Edward Grey to begin planning for a Continental war in support of the French against the Germans.{{efn|He invited Colonel Huguet, the French Military Attache to Plan at War Office from Jan 1906.{{sfn|Haldane|1920|p=}} }} However, Haldane's first estimates reduced the Army by 16,600 men and reduced expenditure by \u00a32.6m to \u00a328&nbsp;million, as the Liberals had been elected on a platform of retrenchment.{{sfn|Reid|2006|pp=136-137}} By 1914 Britain spent 3.4% of national income on defence, little more in absolute terms than Austria-Hungary's 6.1%.  Army expenditure was determined according to a formula devised by the Esher Committee. In 1900, during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], army expenditure was \u00a386.8m, by 1910 (a low point, after four years of cuts under the Liberals) it had dropped to \u00a327.6m and by 1914 it had risen back to \u00a329.4m.  In March 1914 effective expenditure on the Army, after allowing for increased pensions and \u00a31m set aside for military aviation, was still less than in 1907\u20138, and \u00a32m less than in 1905-6 (despite a 20% rise in prices since then).{{sfn|Reid|2006|pp=136-137}}\n\nIn October 1907 Haldane was intimately involved with the negotiations at Windsor with Kaiser Wilhelm. The Germanophile and linguist was thrilled to be summoned at 1&nbsp;am to talk with the Emperor on arms reduction principles over whisky. But the import was the Baghdad-Berlin railway which Germany was hoping to construct with British approval.  A fluent German-speaker, Haldane was lulled into a false sense of security believing 'like a bear with a sore head' that he had won a great deal.{{sfn|Sommer|1960|p=}}{{sfn|Ridley|2012|pp=414-415}}{{sfn|Haldane|1929|p=}} Another such conference took place at Balmoral in September 1909.  The Kaiser arrogantly insisted that only the King was of equal rank.\n\nDespite the budgetary constraints, Haldane implemented a wide-ranging set of reforms of the Army, aimed at preparing the [[British Army|army]] for an Imperial war but with the more likely (and secret) task of a European war. The main element of this was the establishment of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=134}} The Official Historian Brigadier Edmonds later wrote that \"in every respect the Expeditionary Force of 1914 was incomparably the best trained, best organised and best equipped British Army ever to leave these shores\"{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=140}}\n\n[[Image:Haldane a West Point.jpg|thumb|left|Haldane at [[West Point]] sometime before the Great War.]]\n\n==Army reforms==\n{{main|Haldane Reforms}}\nHaldane set up the [[Imperial General Staff]]. Before Haldane, there was only the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, which met only in emergencies, and the Colonial Defence Committee. [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] had recommended the setting up of an Army Council and the abolition of the post of Commander-in-Chief, but few of his recommendations had been implemented before the change of government in December 1905.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=138}} Haldane's reforms also created the [[Territorial Force]] of 14 divisions (the original plan was for 28) and 14 mounted Yeomanry brigades at home,{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=134}} the [[Officer Training Corps]] and the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]].\n\nIn all the reforms, Haldane worked closely at the War Office with [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Major-General Haig]]. By coincidence, both men had been born in Charlotte Square, in Edinburgh. [[John Alfred Spender|J. A. Spender]] later wrote of how Haldane got the best work out of an able but verbally-incoherent soldier (thought to refer to Haig) by not scoring verbal points off him, as many politicians would have done.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nUsually critical, Rosebery remarked on Haldane's interest in philosophy, declaring: \"I have read his Secret Memorandum, and that was enough\". In 1907 and 1908, Haldane passed far-reaching reforms to Army management. He was accredited as an efficient bureaucratic leader, notably founding the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] in a Second Memorandum. His reforms re-oriented British military policy, revamped army organization along the lines of the German General Staff, upgraded the training of the auxiliary forces, and created an efficient and economically run service. Those reforms enabled Britain to send some 120,000 men to France in fifteen days in August 1914.{{sfn|Bond|1963|pp=33-43}}\n\nHaldane was also instrumental in the creation the [[Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] in 1909, which provided the fledgling aircraft industry in the United Kingdom with a sound body of science on which to base the development of aircraft for the next seventy years (it was disbanded in 1979).\n\n==Philosopher-politician==\nThroughout his long career and association with the modernisers or 'Limps' Haldane used his considerable intellect to great advantage against economy.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1977|pp=51-52}} A radical liberal,{{sfn|Tanner|2003|p=45}} Haldane was also, according to historian [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], one of the \"best supporters\" of David Lloyd George's \"[[People's Budget]].\"{{sfn|Pugh|2014|p=46}} During the constitutional and budget crisis of 1909\u201311, Haldane advised his friend and Prime Minister, Asquith on the legal niceties of his stance towards the monarch, who was outraged at the firebrand speeches from Churchill and Lloyd George. Stumbling from illness to illness, Haldane's own bad health was similar to King Edward's declining fortunes.\n\n[[File:Viscount Haldane LC by Vandyk.jpg|thumb|The Viscount Haldane, Lord Chancellor, 1912]]\nTwo elections ensued, one in January and another in December 1910, before in 1911 he was raised to the peerage as '''Viscount Haldane''', of Cloan in the [[County of Perth]].<ref name=\"LG28480\" /> He became Leader in the Lords, responsible for the passage of the Parliament Act. On [[Robert Reid, 1st Earl of Loreburn|Lord Loreburn's]] retirement in June 1912, Haldane succeeded him as [[Lord Chancellor]],{{sfn|Heuston|1987|pp=166-}} making a self-deprecating speech as to his abilities as a legal expert.{{sfn|Haldane|1929|p=253}}\n\n==Haldane Mission==\n1912 saw the unsuccessful attempt of the '''Haldane Mission''', an effort to quell the friction between Britain and Germany arising because of [[Anglo-German naval arms race|their naval arms race]].{{sfn|Scott|1918|pp=589\u2013596}} The mission was a failure because the Germans attempted to link a \"naval holiday\" with a British promise to remain neutral if Germany should become engaged in a war where \"Germany could not be said to be the aggressor.\" Essentially, the British reserved the right to join whatever country was attacking Germany, even if Germany did not start a war dooming the talks to failure. .{{sfn|Maurer|1992|pp=284\u2013308}}{{sfn|Langhorne|1971|pp= 359\u2013370}} On 19 May 1913 he was appointed a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]].\n\n==First World War==\nIn March 1914 Haldane's successor at the War Office, [[Jack Seely]], resigned following the [[Curragh incident]]. Rather than appoint a successor, Asquith decided to take over responsibility for the War Office directly himself. Asquith relied heavily on Haldane as the previous War Secretary and empowered him to carry out tasks at the War Office on his behalf. As the situation in Europe worsened, Asquith kept Haldane abreast of developments with Sir Edward Grey at the Foreign Office. Haldane was one of the first members of the Cabinet to recognise that war with Germany was inevitable and persuaded Asquith to mobilise by assembly of the Army Council on 3 August.{{sfn|Maurice|1937|p=355}} With war imminent, Asquith was happy for Haldane to continue at the War Office formally as Secretary of State for War, but Haldane persuaded him to appoint [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Field Marshal Kitchener]].{{sfn|Maurice|1937|p=355}}\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War One Haldane was falsely accused of pro-German sympathies, in July 1914, for hosting [[Albert Ballin]], a German shipping magnate and unofficial mediator between Germany and Britain. The accusations were widely believed, even being echoed in a popular music hall song (\"All dressed up and nowhere to go\") in the revue \"Mr Manhattan\". He was harried in particular by [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]]'s ''[[Daily Express]]'', which gave great publicity to the claim by Professor Onkel of Heidelberg that he had said that \"Germany was his spiritual home\". He had in fact said that about Professor [[Hermann Lotze]]'s classroom at G\u00f6ttingen, at a dinner party given by [[Mrs. Humphrey Ward]] in April 1913 to enable him to meet some German professors during his mission.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nIn 1915, Asquith ranked his Cabinet, putting Haldane only sixth of the inner cabinet members.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1977|pp=}} He also inveigled Kitchener and Haldane to sign the King's Pledge, a vow to abstain from alcohol for the duration of the war, which Haldane resented and which Churchill and Asquith himself completely ignored.\n\n==Dismissal from office==\n\nHaldane's dismissal from office in May 1915 is widely regarded by historians as unfair.  Following the [[Shell Crisis of 1915|shell crisis]] and the resignation of [[Lord Fisher]] the Liberals were obliged to form a coalition government with the Conservatives who, under the leadership of [[Bonar Law]], insisted on the removal of [[Winston Churchill]] as First Lord of the Admiralty and the dismissal of Haldane.{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=188}}{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|p=360}} Haldane's removal was on account of the popularity of the press's campaign relating to Haldane's alleged pro-German sympathies.{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}} Neither the former prime minister [[Arthur Balfour]],  Haldane's closest friend amongst the Conservatives, nor Asquith, the Liberal prime minister of the day and Haldane's closest political ally and friend for over 30 years, did anything to resist Bonar Law's demands.{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|pp=361-362}}{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}} [[Roy Jenkins]] in his biography of Asquith describes the charges as \"absolute nonsense\u201d and [[Max Egremont]] describes Balfour as \"knowing the injustice behind the charges,\u201d and, \u201cbeing privately indignant.\"{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|p=362}}{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}}\n\nTo the permanent detriment of his previously close relationship with Haldane, Asquith compounded his mistake by not expressing directly to Haldane his feelings on the latter's dismissal and the value of his previous service to the government and country.{{sfn|Sommer|1960|pp=324-328}} Jenkins describes this omission as \u201cthe most uncharacteristic fault of Asquiths whole career\u201d attributing it to Asquith suffering the \"indescribable blow\" of the surprise announcement of the engagement of the woman he loved, [[Venetia Stanley (1887\u20131948)|Venetia Stanley]], to one of his government ministers, [[Edwin Montagu]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|pp= 362-366}}{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=186}}\n\nFollowing his departure from the government Haldane went to the front to meet his old friend General Haig, and his cousin, General [[Aylmer Haldane]]; but he was exhausted on being ejected from Cabinet.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=268}} Having been awarded the Order of Merit in 1915, in the personal gift of George V, he wrote a Memorandum of Events, 1906\u201315, to defend his reputation. It was published in April 1916. Haldane thought Lloyd George's new government, formed in December 1916, \"very low class\". Haldane told Lord Buckmaster at this time, \"Asquith is a first-class head of a deliberative council. He is versed in precedents, acts on principle, and knows how and when to compromise. Lloyd George knows nothing for precedents and cares for no principles, but he has fire in his belly and that is what we want\".{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=226}}\n\nAs the war progressed Haldane moved increasingly close to the Labour Party, but he was held back by his ties to the Liberal Party and to Asquith. When the [[Irish War of Independence]] broke out in 1919, Haldane was one of the first British politicians to argue that the solution lay in compromise rather than force.\n\n== Contribution to Canadian constitutional law ==\n<!-- Please fix redirects to this section (i.e. (the) wicked stepfather of the Canadian Constitution) if you rename this section. Thanks! -->\nAs Lord Chancellor, Haldane was a member of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], at that time the court of last resort for the Empire. He retained the position even when he was no longer Chancellor.  He sat on several cases from Canada dealing with the division of powers between the federal and provincial governments under the [[Canadian Constitution]], particularly the interplay between sections 91 and 92 of the [[British North America Act 1867]]. He gave the decision for the Judicial Committee in several of those cases, and showed a marked tendency to favour the provincial powers at the expense of the federal government.  For instance, in the case of [[Canada v. Alberta|''In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act'']],<ref>''In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act'', 1919 [1922] 1 A.C. 191</ref> he gave the decision striking down federal legislation which attempted to regulate the economy, challenging the legality of the Canadian legislature.{{efn|In 1912 Haldane visited the Canadian Bar in Montreal, Quebec Province, described in {{harvnb|Haldane|1914|p=}} }} In doing so, he gave very restrictive readings to both the \"[[peace, order and good government]]\" power of the federal government, as well as the federal [[criminal law power]].  Similarly, in ''[[Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider]]'',<ref>Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider, [1925] AC 396.</ref> Lord Haldane struck down a federal statute attempting to regulate industrial disputes, holding that it was not within federal authority under either the peace, order and good government power, nor the federal trade and commerce power. He went so far as to suggest that the trade and commerce power was simply an ancillary federal power, which could not authorise legislation in its own right.  The effects of some of these decisions have subsequently been modified by later decisions of the Judicial Committee and the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], but they have had the long-term effect of recognising substantial provincial powers.\n\nHaldane's approach to the division of powers was heavily criticised by some academics and lawyers in Canada, such as [[F. R. Scott]]<ref>F. R. Scott, ''Some Privy Counsel'' (1950), 28 Can. Bar. Rev. 780.</ref> and [[Bora Laskin|Chief Justice Bora Laskin]], as unduly favouring the provinces over the federal government and depriving it of the powers needed to deal with modern economic issues.  More recently, one major study has characterised him as \"the wicked stepfather\" of the Canadian Constitution.{{sfn|Vaughan|2010|p=}}\n\n==Influence on education==\nIn 1895, Haldane helped the Webbs found the [[London School of Economics]].  A fundamental believer in the power of improving education, he prepared the London University Act 1898.  The philosophy of 'national efficiency' was central feature of the Hegelian complex, and the ideas of Schopenhauer, he had learnt on the continent, that accentuated freedom and decentralisation from an historicist's perspective.{{sfn|Vaughan|2010|p=}}  His moral centrism sought to unify ''The New Liberalism'', as he published it in Contemporary Review.<ref>Contemporary Review, (London 1892),</ref>  From a pan-European perspective he analysed the German character and economic advances towards militarism.  He was largely responsible for the cross-party support for Balfour's Education Act 1902.  He told Rosebery \"a sense of nation is working towards ...a great centre party.\"{{sfn|Matthew|1973|p= 145|ps=: from a letter of 6 October 1902}} He was also involved in the founding of [[Imperial College]] in 1907 and in his honour the University contained the Haldane Recreational Library, now part of the [[Imperial College Central Library|Central Library]].\n\nHaldane was a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]] of social reformers set up in 1902 by the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] campaigners [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].  He wrote a biography of Adam Smith, extolling the virtues of free trade.  Unlike Chamberlain, he thought there was no strong connection between fiscal and imperial unity.  He opposed any attempt to protection of British trade.{{sfn|Ashley|1904|loc=Preface}}{{sfn|Matthew|1973|pp= 166\u2013168}}\n\nIn 1904, he was President of the Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott Club and gave the Toast to Sir Walter at the Club's annual dinner, addressing \"The dedicated life\" to a group of students on 10 January 1907.  He also served as second [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Bristol]] where he made an important address titled \"The Civic University\" outlining his educational philosophy in 1911.  At the end of his life Lord Haldane was elected Chancellor of the [[University of St Andrews]] in June 1928.  Perhaps his greatest speech on education was made in House of Lords on 12 July 1916, at the height of the terrible slaughter on the Western Front.{{sfn|Ashby|Anderson|1970|p=135}}\n\n==Writings==\nHaldane co-translated the first English edition of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', published between 1883 and 1886. He wrote several philosophical works, the best known of which is ''The Reign of Relativity'' (1921), which dealt with the philosophical implications of the [[theory of relativity]]. Haldane published \"The Pathway to Reality\", based on the [[Gifford Lectures]] which he had delivered at the [[University of St Andrews]].{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=136}} Some of his public addresses have also been published, including ''[[s:The future of democracy|The future of democracy]]'' (1918).\n\n* {{cite book|first=Richard Burdon|last=Haldane|ref=harv|display-authors=0|title=The Pathway to Reality|date=1903|publisher=John Murray|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/pathwaytorealit03haldgoog}}\n\n*{{cite book|first=Richard Burdon|last=Haldane|ref=harv|display-authors=0|title=The Pathway to Reality: Stage the Second|date=1904|publisher=E.

He suffered from bad rheumatism, a stigmata in the eye and in 1909, he had to take bed rest when going blind from iritis. A lifelong walker and cigar smoker, he was diagnosed diabetic. \"The latter is a large, fat man\" was [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Haig]]'s initial impression of a dignified but portly demeanour.  Yet, added Haig, \"One seems to like the man at once.\" Having worked on the Army Regulations of 1909, Haig applauded \"a most clear headed and practical man\u2013\u2013very ready to listen and weigh carefully all that is said to him.\" [[Osbert Sitwell]] described him as \"entering a room with the air of a whole procession\". [[Leo Amery]] said he looked like \"the old-fashioned family butler\".{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} Another Imperialist, Winston Churchill also respected Haldane, although they were from differing social backgrounds. On promoting Churchill to First Lord of the Admiralty, Asquith advised him to seek Haldane's advice at a meeting held at Archerfield, North Berwick.{{efn|Haldane was impressed by the younger man's public speech at Bradford on 15 July 1898 during his early radicalism.}} From 1907 to 1908, he was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]].\n\nHaldane remained a lifelong bachelor after his fianc\u00e9e, Miss Valentine Ferguson, broke off their engagement. He died suddenly of heart disease at his home in [[Auchterarder]], Scotland, on 19 August 1928, aged 72.<ref name=\"nytimes19280820\" /> The viscountcy became extinct on his death.\n\n==Later years==\nIn December 1918, Lloyd George appointed Haldane chairman of 'The Machinery of Government' committee.<ref name=\"civilservant.org.uk\" /> However, the Armistice had taken all impetus out of the reform agenda.\n\nAt the time of the [[1920 Paisley by-election|Paisley by-election of January 1920]] Haldane was in the process of shifting his sympathies from Liberal to Labour, and was wrongly thought to have endorsed Labour (earning a rebuke from [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]], whom Haldane thought \"tiresome because she is ignorant\", to his aged mother). In fact he favoured Asquith's election on a personal level.{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=246-247}}\n\nBeing a fluent German speaker, ascetic philosopher and atheist, he played host to [[Albert Einstein]], when he visited London in 1921.  As President of the Institute of Public Administration, he was a leading intellectual on the philosophy of governance. \"The Reign of Relativity\" combined Haldane's love of all things German expressed by Goethe and his works, with the Hegelian military-industrial complex.{{sfn|Haldane|1929|loc=A Hegelian Army|pp=183-185.}} Haldane admired the fact that Germans were \"trained to obey\".{{sfn|Haldane|1920|p=}} Hegel's aristocratic desire for law and order and defence of property against revolution had a mathematical symmetry. Hegel was a purist: his work attempted to keep science and philosophy apart  The rising tide of New Liberalism and moral realism was for Haldane, Hegel's philological precept to improve behaviour, using the empiricism of scientific data as a proof.{{sfn|Haldane|1922|p=}}{{sfn|Haldane|1926|p=}}\n\nHaldane refused to join the platform for Asquith's speech at [[Westminster Central Hall]] in January 1922. He stated that his main interest in public life was now education reform and that the cause was not best served by endorsing the Liberal Party.{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=253-255}} It was not until the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1923]] that Haldane formally sided with Labour, and made several speeches on behalf of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidates.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} When the [[First Labour Government (UK)|Labour government]] was formed by [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in early 1924, Haldane was recruited to serve once again as [[Lord Chancellor]].<ref name=\"LG32901\" /> He was also joint Leader of the Labour Peers with [[Charles Cripps, 1st Baron Parmoor|Lord Parmoor]]. Haldane was a vital member of the [[Labour Government 1924|Cabinet]] as he was one of only three members who had sat in a cabinet before.<ref name=\"eswsc.com\" />\n\nHaldane was responsible for drafting the London University Act 1926, purchasing properties in Euston.

In speech fluent and even infinite he yielded to no living idealist in the easy coinage of sentimental phraseology. Here, indeed, he was a match for those who distributed the chloroform of Berlin. Do we not remember, for instance, that Germany was his spiritual home? But he none the less prepared himself, and the Empire, to talk when the time came with his spiritual friends in language not in the least spiritual. He devised the Territorial Army, which was capable of becoming the easy nucleus of national conscription, and which unquestionably ought to have been used for that purpose at the outbreak of war. He created the Imperial General Staff. He founded the Officers' Training Corps.\n|source={{citation|author=Lord Birkenhead|author-link=F. E.

powerful, subtle and encyclopaedic intellects ever devoted to the public service of his country\".{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nThe military historian [[Correlli Barnett]] claimed that Haldane had \"all-round personal talents far exceeding those of his predecessors\" as [[Secretary of State for War]] and that he was \"a man of first-class intellect and wide

He was [[Secretary of State for War]] between 1905 and 1912 during which time the \"[[Haldane Reforms]]\" of the British Army were implemented. Raised to the peerage as [[Viscount Haldane]] in 1911, he was [[Lord Chancellor]] between 1912 and 1915, when he was forced to resign because of false allegations of German sympathies. He later joined the Labour Party and once again served as Lord Chancellor in 1924 in the first ever Labour administration. Apart from his legal and political careers, Haldane was also an influential writer on philosophy, in recognition of which he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1914.\n\n==Background and education==\nHaldane was born at 17 [[Charlotte Square]], Edinburgh, the son of Robert Haldane and his wife Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Burdon-Sanderson. He was the grandson of the Scottish evangelist [[James Alexander Haldane]], the brother of respiratory [[physiologist]] [[John Scott Haldane]], [[William Haldane|Sir William Haldane]] and author [[Elizabeth Haldane]], and the uncle of [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Naomi Mitchison]].\n\nHe received his first education at the [[Edinburgh Academy]], and then at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. He gained a first and MA at [[University of Edinburgh]]<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\" /> where he received first-class honours in Philosophy and as Gray scholar and Ferguson scholar in philosophy of the four Scottish Universities.\n\nAfter studying law in London, he was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] by [[Lincoln's Inn]], in 1879,<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/> and became a successful lawyer. He was taken on at 5 New Square Chambers by [[Horace Davey, Baron Davey|Lord Davey]] in 1882 as the junior.  Haldane's practice was a specialism in [[conveyancing]]; a particular skill for pleadings at appeal and tribunal cases, bringing cases to the privy council and house of Lords.  By 1890 he had become a [[Queen's Counsel]].<ref name=\"LG26018\" /> By 1905 he was earning [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]20,000 per annum at the Bar{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} ({{Inflation|index=UK|currsign=\u00a3|value=20000|start_year=1905|fmt=eq|r=-5}}). He became a [[bencher]] at Lincoln's Inn in 1893.  Amongst his early friends was [[Edmund Gosse]], the scholarly librarian at the inn's law library, whose help made Haldane well known for being fully prepared in court and parliamentary briefs.\n\nHaldane was a deep thinker, an unusual breed: a philosopher-politician.  During his stay at G\u00f6ttingen he expanded an interest in the German philosophers, Schopenauer and Hegel.  He had refused a place at Balliol, but in nodding respect for the Master and philosopher, [[Thomas Hill Green|T H Green]], he dedicated his Schopenauer translation ''The World as Will and Idea'' which he carried through with a friend, [[Peter Hume Brown]], the Scottish historian.\n\n==Early political career==\nA cousin, the Whig politician [[Robert Adam Philips Haldane Haldane-Duncan, 3rd Earl of Camperdown|Lord Camperdown]] encouraged the young barrister into standing as a Liberal at the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|General Election of 1880]]. Although not elected that year Haldane joined the [[Eighty Club]], a political dining and discussion club formed in 1879. Membership was restricted to Liberals under the age of forty. In 1881 Haldane met [[H. H. Asquith]], and they soon became firm friends often meeting the Blue Post Public house on Cork Street. They were founders of the Albert Grey committee, named after Earl Grey, regularly discussing burning social issues, such as education.\n\nIn November 1885 Haldane was elected [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament for [[Haddingtonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Haddingtonshire]], a seat he held until 1911.<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/><ref name=\"leighrayment.com\" /> The philosopher-politician wrote several articles for the advanced and progressive ''Contemporary Review''.  In October 1888, \"The Liberal Creed\" was published summarising his belief in the direction of New Liberalism.  In the 1890 article  \"The Eight Hours Question\" Haldane rejected the idea of the eight-hour day.  In 1888, he courted Emma Valentine Ferguson, sister of his Liberal party friend, [[Ronald Munro-Ferguson]]; she broke off the engagement and subsequently lampooned him in her novel ''Betsy'' in 1892.  Haldane became firmly ensconced in the Imperialist wing of Liberalism, led by Sir Edward Grey.  At the 1892 General Election, he received a shock when nearly defeated by the Liberal Unionist Master of Polwarth. [[Beatrice Webb]], the socialist who was a close intimate, remarked on how alone Haldane was in the world.{{sfn|Webb|1948|p=98}} Haldane added the preface to [[L T Hobhouse]]'s ''The Labour Movement'' in 1893.  Sadly Emma Ferguson died insane in 1897.  ''He had pathos in his personality'', remarked Webb, ''a successful lawyer tinged with socialism''.{{sfn|Webb|1986|p=345}}\n\n===Liberal Imperialist===\nFocusing on his writings, Haldane was passed over for political office, being the only one of his group left out in the wilderness.  Haldane remained an ally of Asquith and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] in the [[Liberal Imperialist]] wing of the party, followers of Lord Rosebery rather than of Sir William Harcourt. Rosebery admired Haldane's intellect, and the Scotsman urged upon his friend, whom he had known since 1886, an assault on Tory power in the Lords in 1894.<ref name=\"Rosebery\" />  Haldane joined friends at the Articles Club, including Asquith and Grey. Haldane was disappointed having failed to secure the post of Solicitor-General in October 1894. At the time, Asquith wryly remarked, ''A very wrong decision come to upon inadequate grounds.''{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|p= 335}} Haldane was sounded out of the Speakership by Rosebery, but refused it, declaring it to be a political death. The post went eventually to W Gully in 1895.\n\nAt a meeting with [[Beatrice Webb]], the Fabian socialist, Haldane told her he was disconsolate at the condition of the Liberal Party: \"Rot has set in there is no hope now but to be beaten and then reconstruct a new party\".{{efn|Diary of Beatrice Webb, 20 January 1895,<ref name=\"Passfield Papers\" /> cited in {{harvnb|McKinstry|2005|pp= 338-339}} }} The leaders of the party were exasperated and believed Rosebery to lack planning and direction. \"Although Asquith, Grey and I\", wrote Haldane, \"stuck by him... we never knew when he would retire and leave us in the lurch\".{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc=Note to his letters}} When Rosebery offered the Speakership, he refused it that March.{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc= Mss NLS 5951}} However, on 11 October 1896, he wrote to Rosebery that he \"was the leader of a revolution in our party\".{{sfn|Matthew|2011}}\n\nOn 11 August 1902, Haldane was admitted to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]],<ref name=\"LG27464\" /> following an announcement of the King's intention to make the appointment in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list, published in June that year.<ref name=\"TheTimes1902\" /> The King used his influence and charm to cultivate allies, bringing cross-party groups like [[The Souls]] together in consensual amity.{{sfn|Ridley|2012|p=}} Balfour's administration leant on Haldane's philosophy for educational reforms.\n\nAfter the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Arthur Balfour]] fell in December 1905 there was some speculation that Asquith and his allies Haldane and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] would refuse to serve unless Campbell-Bannerman accepted a peerage, which would have left Asquith as the real leader in the House of Commons. Haldane had suggested involving the King at Balmoral to 'kick CB upstairs'.{{sfn|Ridley|2012|pp=397-398}}However, the plot (called \"[[The Relugas Compact]]\" after Grey's Scottish lodge where the men met) collapsed when Asquith agreed to serve as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under Campbell-Bannerman.{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|pp=467-468}}\n\nHaldane wrote, \"One longs for Rosebery had he been coming in to his right place at the head of affairs, we could have gone anywhere with confidence. But it seems now as if this were not to be and we have to do the only thing we can do, which is to resolutely follow a plan of concerted action\".{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc=Letter from Lord Haldane to Sir Francis Knollys, Private Secretary to Edward VII on 12 September 1905}}\n\nOn 13 December 1905, Haldane was appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], but he may have been offered the jobs of Attorney-General and Home Secretary.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} (Grey became Foreign Secretary).<ref name=\"LG27862\" /> Unity in the Liberals helped them obtain the largest electoral majority in the party's history in the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|p= 476}}\n\n==Secretary of State for War==\nAs early as January 1906 Haldane was persuaded by fellow Liberal Imperialist Edward Grey to begin planning for a Continental war in support of the French against the Germans.{{efn|He invited Colonel Huguet, the French Military Attache to Plan at War Office from Jan 1906.{{sfn|Haldane|1920|p=}} }} However, Haldane's first estimates reduced the Army by 16,600 men and reduced expenditure by \u00a32.6m to \u00a328&nbsp;million, as the Liberals had been elected on a platform of retrenchment.{{sfn|Reid|2006|pp=136-137}} By 1914 Britain spent 3.4% of national income on defence, little more in absolute terms than Austria-Hungary's 6.1%.  Army expenditure was determined according to a formula devised by the Esher Committee. In 1900, during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], army expenditure was \u00a386.8m, by 1910 (a low point, after four years of cuts under the Liberals) it had dropped to \u00a327.6m and by 1914 it had risen back to \u00a329.4m.  In March 1914 effective expenditure on the Army, after allowing for increased pensions and \u00a31m set aside for military aviation, was still less than in 1907\u20138, and \u00a32m less than in 1905-6 (despite a 20% rise in prices since then).{{sfn|Reid|2006|pp=136-137}}\n\nIn October 1907 Haldane was intimately involved with the negotiations at Windsor with Kaiser Wilhelm. The Germanophile and linguist was thrilled to be summoned at 1&nbsp;am to talk with the Emperor on arms reduction principles over whisky. But the import was the Baghdad-Berlin railway which Germany was hoping to construct with British approval.  A fluent German-speaker, Haldane was lulled into a false sense of security believing 'like a bear with a sore head' that he had won a great deal.{{sfn|Sommer|1960|p=}}{{sfn|Ridley|2012|pp=414-415}}{{sfn|Haldane|1929|p=}} Another such conference took place at Balmoral in September 1909.  The Kaiser arrogantly insisted that only the King was of equal rank.\n\nDespite the budgetary constraints, Haldane implemented a wide-ranging set of reforms of the Army, aimed at preparing the [[British Army|army]] for an Imperial war but with the more likely (and secret) task of a European war. The main element of this was the establishment of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=134}} The Official Historian Brigadier Edmonds later wrote that \"in every respect the Expeditionary Force of 1914 was incomparably the best trained, best organised and best equipped British Army ever to leave these shores\"{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=140}}\n\n[[Image:Haldane a West Point.jpg|thumb|left|Haldane at [[West Point]] sometime before the Great War.]]\n\n==Army reforms==\n{{main|Haldane Reforms}}\nHaldane set up the [[Imperial General Staff]]. Before Haldane, there was only the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, which met only in emergencies, and the Colonial Defence Committee. [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] had recommended the setting up of an Army Council and the abolition of the post of Commander-in-Chief, but few of his recommendations had been implemented before the change of government in December 1905.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=138}} Haldane's reforms also created the [[Territorial Force]] of 14 divisions (the original plan was for 28) and 14 mounted Yeomanry brigades at home,{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=134}} the [[Officer Training Corps]] and the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]].\n\nIn all the reforms, Haldane worked closely at the War Office with [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Major-General Haig]]. By coincidence, both men had been born in Charlotte Square, in Edinburgh. [[John Alfred Spender|J. A. Spender]] later wrote of how Haldane got the best work out of an able but verbally-incoherent soldier (thought to refer to Haig) by not scoring verbal points off him, as many politicians would have done.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nUsually critical, Rosebery remarked on Haldane's interest in philosophy, declaring: \"I have read his Secret Memorandum, and that was enough\". In 1907 and 1908, Haldane passed far-reaching reforms to Army management. He was accredited as an efficient bureaucratic leader, notably founding the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] in a Second Memorandum. His reforms re-oriented British military policy, revamped army organization along the lines of the German General Staff, upgraded the training of the auxiliary forces, and created an efficient and economically run service. Those reforms enabled Britain to send some 120,000 men to France in fifteen days in August 1914.{{sfn|Bond|1963|pp=33-43}}\n\nHaldane was also instrumental in the creation the [[Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] in 1909, which provided the fledgling aircraft industry in the United Kingdom with a sound body of science on which to base the development of aircraft for the next seventy years (it was disbanded in 1979).\n\n==Philosopher-politician==\nThroughout his long career and association with the modernisers or 'Limps' Haldane used his considerable intellect to great advantage against economy.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1977|pp=51-52}} A radical liberal,{{sfn|Tanner|2003|p=45}} Haldane was also, according to historian [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], one of the \"best supporters\" of David Lloyd George's \"[[People's Budget]].\"{{sfn|Pugh|2014|p=46}} During the constitutional and budget crisis of 1909\u201311, Haldane advised his friend and Prime Minister, Asquith on the legal niceties of his stance towards the monarch, who was outraged at the firebrand speeches from Churchill and Lloyd George. Stumbling from illness to illness, Haldane's own bad health was similar to King Edward's declining fortunes.\n\n[[File:Viscount Haldane LC by Vandyk.jpg|thumb|The Viscount Haldane, Lord Chancellor, 1912]]\nTwo elections ensued, one in January and another in December 1910, before in 1911 he was raised to the peerage as '''Viscount Haldane''', of Cloan in the [[County of Perth]].<ref name=\"LG28480\" /> He became Leader in the Lords, responsible for the passage of the Parliament Act. On [[Robert Reid, 1st Earl of Loreburn|Lord Loreburn's]] retirement in June 1912, Haldane succeeded him as [[Lord Chancellor]],{{sfn|Heuston|1987|pp=166-}} making a self-deprecating speech as to his abilities as a legal expert.{{sfn|Haldane|1929|p=253}}\n\n==Haldane Mission==\n1912 saw the unsuccessful attempt of the '''Haldane Mission''', an effort to quell the friction between Britain and Germany arising because of [[Anglo-German naval arms race|their naval arms race]].{{sfn|Scott|1918|pp=589\u2013596}} The mission was a failure because the Germans attempted to link a \"naval holiday\" with a British promise to remain neutral if Germany should become engaged in a war where \"Germany could not be said to be the aggressor.\" Essentially, the British reserved the right to join whatever country was attacking Germany, even if Germany did not start a war dooming the talks to failure. .{{sfn|Maurer|1992|pp=284\u2013308}}{{sfn|Langhorne|1971|pp= 359\u2013370}} On 19 May 1913 he was appointed a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]].\n\n==First World War==\nIn March 1914 Haldane's successor at the War Office, [[Jack Seely]], resigned following the [[Curragh incident]]. Rather than appoint a successor, Asquith decided to take over responsibility for the War Office directly himself. Asquith relied heavily on Haldane as the previous War Secretary and empowered him to carry out tasks at the War Office on his behalf. As the situation in Europe worsened, Asquith kept Haldane abreast of developments with Sir Edward Grey at the Foreign Office. Haldane was one of the first members of the Cabinet to recognise that war with Germany was inevitable and persuaded Asquith to mobilise by assembly of the Army Council on 3 August.{{sfn|Maurice|1937|p=355}} With war imminent, Asquith was happy for Haldane to continue at the War Office formally as Secretary of State for War, but Haldane persuaded him to appoint [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Field Marshal Kitchener]].{{sfn|Maurice|1937|p=355}}\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War One Haldane was falsely accused of pro-German sympathies, in July 1914, for hosting [[Albert Ballin]], a German shipping magnate and unofficial mediator between Germany and Britain. The accusations were widely believed, even being echoed in a popular music hall song (\"All dressed up and nowhere to go\") in the revue \"Mr Manhattan\". He was harried in particular by [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]]'s ''[[Daily Express]]'', which gave great publicity to the claim by Professor Onkel of Heidelberg that he had said that \"Germany was his spiritual home\". He had in fact said that about Professor [[Hermann Lotze]]'s classroom at G\u00f6ttingen, at a dinner party given by [[Mrs. Humphrey Ward]] in April 1913 to enable him to meet some German professors during his mission.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nIn 1915, Asquith ranked his Cabinet, putting Haldane only sixth of the inner cabinet members.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1977|pp=}} He also inveigled Kitchener and Haldane to sign the King's Pledge, a vow to abstain from alcohol for the duration of the war, which Haldane resented and which Churchill and Asquith himself completely ignored.\n\n==Dismissal from office==\n\nHaldane's dismissal from office in May 1915 is widely regarded by historians as unfair.  Following the [[Shell Crisis of 1915|shell crisis]] and the resignation of [[Lord Fisher]] the Liberals were obliged to form a coalition government with the Conservatives who, under the leadership of [[Bonar Law]], insisted on the removal of [[Winston Churchill]] as First Lord of the Admiralty and the dismissal of Haldane.{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=188}}{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|p=360}} Haldane's removal was on account of the popularity of the press's campaign relating to Haldane's alleged pro-German sympathies.{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}} Neither the former prime minister [[Arthur Balfour]],  Haldane's closest friend amongst the Conservatives, nor Asquith, the Liberal prime minister of the day and Haldane's closest political ally and friend for over 30 years, did anything to resist Bonar Law's demands.{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|pp=361-362}}{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}} [[Roy Jenkins]] in his biography of Asquith describes the charges as \"absolute nonsense\u201d and [[Max Egremont]] describes Balfour as \"knowing the injustice behind the charges,\u201d and, \u201cbeing privately indignant.\"{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|p=362}}{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}}\n\nTo the permanent detriment of his previously close relationship with Haldane, Asquith compounded his mistake by not expressing directly to Haldane his feelings on the latter's dismissal and the value of his previous service to the government and country.{{sfn|Sommer|1960|pp=324-328}} Jenkins describes this omission as \u201cthe most uncharacteristic fault of Asquiths whole career\u201d attributing it to Asquith suffering the \"indescribable blow\" of the surprise announcement of the engagement of the woman he loved, [[Venetia Stanley (1887\u20131948)|Venetia Stanley]], to one of his government ministers, [[Edwin Montagu]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|pp= 362-366}}{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=186}}\n\nFollowing his departure from the government Haldane went to the front to meet his old friend General Haig, and his cousin, General [[Aylmer Haldane]]; but he was exhausted on being ejected from Cabinet.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=268}} Having been awarded the Order of Merit in 1915, in the personal gift of George V, he wrote a Memorandum of Events, 1906\u201315, to defend his reputation. It was published in April 1916. Haldane thought Lloyd George's new government, formed in December 1916, \"very low class\". Haldane told Lord Buckmaster at this time, \"Asquith is a first-class head of a deliberative council. He is versed in precedents, acts on principle, and knows how and when to compromise. Lloyd George knows nothing for precedents and cares for no principles, but he has fire in his belly and that is what we want\".{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=226}}\n\nAs the war progressed Haldane moved increasingly close to the Labour Party, but he was held back by his ties to the Liberal Party and to Asquith. When the [[Irish War of Independence]] broke out in 1919, Haldane was one of the first British politicians to argue that the solution lay in compromise rather than force.\n\n== Contribution to Canadian constitutional law ==\n<!-- Please fix redirects to this section (i.e. (the) wicked stepfather of the Canadian Constitution) if you rename this section. Thanks! -->\nAs Lord Chancellor, Haldane was a member of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], at that time the court of last resort for the Empire. He retained the position even when he was no longer Chancellor.  He sat on several cases from Canada dealing with the division of powers between the federal and provincial governments under the [[Canadian Constitution]], particularly the interplay between sections 91 and 92 of the [[British North America Act 1867]]. He gave the decision for the Judicial Committee in several of those cases, and showed a marked tendency to favour the provincial powers at the expense of the federal government.  For instance, in the case of [[Canada v. Alberta|''In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act'']],<ref>''In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act'', 1919 [1922] 1 A.C. 191</ref> he gave the decision striking down federal legislation which attempted to regulate the economy, challenging the legality of the Canadian legislature.{{efn|In 1912 Haldane visited the Canadian Bar in Montreal, Quebec Province, described in {{harvnb|Haldane|1914|p=}} }} In doing so, he gave very restrictive readings to both the \"[[peace, order and good government]]\" power of the federal government, as well as the federal [[criminal law power]].  Similarly, in ''[[Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider]]'',<ref>Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider, [1925] AC 396.</ref> Lord Haldane struck down a federal statute attempting to regulate industrial disputes, holding that it was not within federal authority under either the peace, order and good government power, nor the federal trade and commerce power. He went so far as to suggest that the trade and commerce power was simply an ancillary federal power, which could not authorise legislation in its own right.  The effects of some of these decisions have subsequently been modified by later decisions of the Judicial Committee and the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], but they have had the long-term effect of recognising substantial provincial powers.\n\nHaldane's approach to the division of powers was heavily criticised by some academics and lawyers in Canada, such as [[F. R. Scott]]<ref>F. R. Scott, ''Some Privy Counsel'' (1950), 28 Can. Bar. Rev. 780.</ref> and [[Bora Laskin|Chief Justice Bora Laskin]], as unduly favouring the provinces over the federal government and depriving it of the powers needed to deal with modern economic issues.  More recently, one major study has characterised him as \"the wicked stepfather\" of the Canadian Constitution.{{sfn|Vaughan|2010|p=}}\n\n==Influence on education==\nIn 1895, Haldane helped the Webbs found the [[London School of Economics]].  A fundamental believer in the power of improving education, he prepared the London University Act 1898.  The philosophy of 'national efficiency' was central feature of the Hegelian complex, and the ideas of Schopenauer, he had learnt on the continent, that accentuated freedom and decentralisation from an historicist's perspective.{{sfn|Vaughan|2010|p=}}  His moral centrism sought to unify ''The New Liberalism'', as he published it in Contemporary Review.<ref>Contemporary Review, (London 1892),</ref>  From a pan-European perspective he analysed the German character and economic advances towards militarism.  He was largely responsible for the cross-party support for Balfour's Education Act 1902.  He told Rosebery \"a sense of nation is working towards ...a great centre party.\"{{sfn|Matthew|1973|p= 145|ps=: from a letter of 6 October 1902}} He was also involved in the founding of [[Imperial College]] in 1907 and in his honour the University contained the Haldane Recreational Library, now part of the [[Imperial College Central Library|Central Library]].\n\nHaldane was a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]] of social reformers set up in 1902 by the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] campaigners [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].  He wrote a biography of Adam Smith, extolling the virtues of free trade.  Unlike Chamberlain, he thought there was no strong connection between fiscal and imperial unity.  He opposed any attempt to protection of British trade.{{sfn|Ashley|1904|loc=Preface}}{{sfn|Matthew|1973|pp= 166\u2013168}}\n\nIn 1904, he was President of the Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott Club and gave the Toast to Sir Walter at the Club's annual dinner, addressing \"The dedicated life\" to a group of students on 10 January 1907.  He also served as second [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Bristol]] where he made an important address titled \"The Civic University\" outlining his educational philosophy in 1911.  At the end of his life Lord Haldane was elected Chancellor of the [[University of St Andrews]] in June 1928.  Perhaps his greatest speech on education was made in House of Lords on 12 July 1916, at the height of the terrible slaughter on the Western Front.{{sfn|Ashby|Anderson|1970|p=135}}\n\n==Writings==\nHaldane co-translated the first English edition of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', published between 1883 and 1886. He wrote several philosophical works, the best known of which is ''The Reign of Relativity'' (1921), which dealt with the philosophical implications of the [[theory of relativity]]. Haldane published \"The Pathway to Reality\", based on the [[Gifford Lectures]] which he had delivered at the [[University of St Andrews]].{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=136}} Some of his public addresses have also been published, including ''[[s:The future of democracy|The future of democracy]]'' (1918).\n\n* {{cite book|first=Richard Burdon|last=Haldane|ref=harv|display-authors=0|title=The Pathway to Reality|date=1903|publisher=John Murray|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/pathwaytorealit03haldgoog}}\n\n*{{cite book|first=Richard Burdon|last=Haldane|ref=harv|display-authors=0|title=The Pathway to Reality: Stage the Second|date=1904|publisher=E.

He suffered from bad rheumatism, a stigmata in the eye and in 1909, he had to take bed rest when going blind from iritis. A lifelong walker and cigar smoker, he was diagnosed diabetic. \"The latter is a large, fat man\" was [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Haig]]'s initial impression of a dignified but portly demeanour.  Yet, added Haig, \"One seems to like the man at once.\" Having worked on the Army Regulations of 1909, Haig applauded \"a most clear headed and practical man\u2013\u2013very ready to listen and weigh carefully all that is said to him.\" [[Osbert Sitwell]] described him as \"entering a room with the air of a whole procession\". [[Leo Amery]] said he looked like \"the old-fashioned family butler\".{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} Another Imperialist, Winston Churchill also respected Haldane, although they were from differing social backgrounds. On promoting Churchill to First Lord of the Admiralty, Asquith advised him to seek Haldane's advice at a meeting held at Archerfield, North Berwick.{{efn|Haldane was impressed by the younger man's public speech at Bradford on 15 July 1898 during his early radicalism.}} From 1907 to 1908, he was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]].\n\nHaldane remained a lifelong bachelor after his fianc\u00e9e, Miss Valentine Ferguson, broke off their engagement. He died suddenly of heart disease at his home in [[Auchterarder]], Scotland, on 19 August 1928, aged 72.<ref name=\"nytimes19280820\" /> The viscountcy became extinct on his death.\n\n==Later years==\nIn December 1918, Lloyd George appointed Haldane chairman of 'The Machinery of Government' committee.<ref name=\"civilservant.org.uk\" /> However, the Armistice had taken all impetus out of the reform agenda.\n\nAt the time of the [[1920 Paisley by-election|Paisley by-election of January 1920]] Haldane was in the process of shifting his sympathies from Liberal to Labour, and was wrongly thought to have endorsed Labour (earning a rebuke from [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]], whom Haldane thought \"tiresome because she is ignorant\", to his aged mother). In fact he favoured Asquith's election on a personal level.{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=246-247}}\n\nBeing a fluent German speaker, ascetic philosopher and atheist, he played host to [[Albert Einstein]], when he visited London in 1921.  As President of the Institute of Public Administration, he was a leading intellectual on the philosophy of governance. \"The Reign of Relativity\" combined Haldane's love of all things German expressed by Goethe and his works, with the Hegelian military-industrial complex.{{sfn|Haldane|1929|loc=A Hegelian Army|pp=183-185.}} Haldane admired the fact that Germans were \"trained to obey\".{{sfn|Haldane|1920|p=}} Hegel's aristocratic desire for law and order and defence of property against revolution had a mathematical symmetry. Hegel was a purist: his work attempted to keep science and philosophy apart  The rising tide of New Liberalism and moral realism was for Haldane, Hegel's philological precept to improve behaviour, using the empiricism of scientific data as a proof.{{sfn|Haldane|1922|p=}}{{sfn|Haldane|1926|p=}}\n\nHaldane refused to join the platform for Asquith's speech at [[Westminster Central Hall]] in January 1922. He stated that his main interest in public life was now education reform and that the cause was not best served by endorsing the Liberal Party.{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=253-255}} It was not until the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1923]] that Haldane formally sided with Labour, and made several speeches on behalf of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidates.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} When the [[First Labour Government (UK)|Labour government]] was formed by [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in early 1924, Haldane was recruited to serve once again as [[Lord Chancellor]].<ref name=\"LG32901\" /> He was also joint Leader of the Labour Peers with [[Charles Cripps, 1st Baron Parmoor|Lord Parmoor]]. Haldane was a vital member of the [[Labour Government 1924|Cabinet]] as he was one of only three members who had sat in a cabinet before.<ref name=\"eswsc.com\" />\n\nHaldane was responsible for drafting the London University Act 1926, purchasing properties in Euston.

Do we not remember, for instance, that Germany was his spiritual home? But he none the less prepared himself, and the Empire, to talk when the time came with his spiritual friends in language not in the least spiritual.

The screenplay, written by [[Ernest Tidyman]], is based on [[Robin Moore]]'s 1969 non-fiction book ''[[The French Connection (book)|The French Connection]]''. It tells the story of [[New York Police Department]] detectives [[Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle]] and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo, whose real-life counterparts were Narcotics Detectives [[Eddie Egan]] and [[Sonny Grosso]], in pursuit of wealthy French heroin smuggler Alain Charnier. The film stars [[Gene Hackman]] as Popeye, [[Roy Scheider]] as Cloudy, and [[Fernando Rey]] as Charnier. [[Tony Lo Bianco]] and [[Marcel Bozzuffi]] also star. [[The Three Degrees]] are featured in a nightclub scene.\n\nAt the [[44th Academy Awards]], it won the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Hackman), [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Friedkin), [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (Tidyman). It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Scheider), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]]. Tidyman also received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination, a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] and an [[Edgar Award]] for his [[screenplay]]. A sequel,   ''[[French Connection II]]'', followed in 1975 with Gene Hackman and Fernando Rey reprising their roles.\n\nThe [[American Film Institute]] included the film in its list of the best American films [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|in 1998]] and [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|again in 2007]].  In 2005 the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Marseille]], an undercover police detective follows Alain Charnier, who runs the world's largest heroin-smuggling syndicate. The policeman is assassinated by Charnier's hitman, Pierre Nicoli. Charnier plans to smuggle $32 million worth of heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, television personality Henri Devereaux, who is traveling to New York City by ship.\n\nIn New York City, detectives [[Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle]] and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo go out for drinks at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. Popeye notices Salvatore \"Sal\" Boca and his young wife, Angie, entertaining mobsters involved in narcotics. They tail the couple and establish a link between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock, who is part of the narcotics underworld.\n\nPopeye learns from an informant that a massive shipment of heroin will arrive in the next two weeks. The detectives convince their supervisor to wiretap the Bocas' phones. Popeye and Cloudy are joined by federal agents Mulderig and Klein.\n\nDevereaux's vehicle arrives in New York City. Boca is impatient to make the purchase\u2014reflecting Charnier's desire to return to France as soon as possible\u2014while Weinstock, with more experience in smuggling, urges patience, knowing Boca's phone is tapped and that they are being investigated.\n\nCharnier realizes he is being observed. He \"makes\" Popeye and escapes on a departing subway shuttle. To avoid being tailed, he has Boca meet him in Washington D.C., where Boca asks for a delay to avoid the police. Charnier, however, wants to conclude the deal quickly. On the flight back to New York City, Nicoli offers to kill Popeye, but Charnier objects, knowing that Popeye would be replaced by another policeman. Nicoli insists, however, saying they will be back in France before a replacement is assigned.\n\nSoon after, Nicoli attempts to shoot Popeye but misses. Popeye chases Nicoli, who boards an elevated train. Popeye commandeers a car and gives chase. Realizing he is being pursued, Nicoli works his way forward through the carriages, shoots a policeman who tries to intervene and hijacks the motorman at gunpoint, forcing him to drive straight through the next station, also shooting the train conductor. The motorman passes out and they are just about to slam into a stationary train when an emergency trackside brake engages, hurling the assassin against a glass window. Popeye arrives to see the killer descending from the platform. When the killer sees Popeye, he turns to run but is shot dead by Popeye.\n\nAfter a lengthy stakeout, Popeye impounds Devereaux's [[Lincoln Continental]]. He and his team take it apart searching for the drugs, but come up empty-handed. Cloudy notes that the vehicle's shipping weight is 120 pounds over its listed manufacturer's weight. They remove the rocker panels and discover the heroin concealed therein. The police restore the car to its original condition and return it to Devereaux, who delivers the Lincoln Continental to Charnier.\n\nCharnier drives to an old factory on [[Wards Island]] to meet Weinstock and deliver the drugs. After Charnier has the rocker panels removed, Weinstock's chemist tests one of the bags and confirms its quality. Charnier removes the drugs and hides the money, concealing it beneath the rocker panels of another car purchased at an auction of junk cars, which he will take back to France. Charnier and Sal drive off in the Lincoln, but hit a roadblock with a large contingent of police led by Popeye. The police chase the Lincoln back to the factory, where Boca is killed during a shootout while most of the other criminals surrender.\n\nCharnier escapes into the warehouse with Popeye and Cloudy in pursuit. Popeye sees a shadowy figure in the distance and opens fire a split-second after shouting a warning, killing Mulderig. Undaunted, Popeye tells Cloudy that he will get Charnier. After reloading his gun, Popeye runs into another room and a single gunshot is heard.\n\nTitle cards note that Weinstock was indicted but his case dismissed for \"lack of proper evidence\"; Angie Boca received a suspended sentence for an unspecified misdemeanor; Lou Boca received a reduced sentence; Devereaux served four years in a federal penitentiary for conspiracy; and Charnier was never caught. Popeye and Cloudy were transferred out of the narcotics division and reassigned.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Det.

The film was among the earliest to [[List of films featuring the World Trade Center|show the World Trade Center]]: the completed North Tower and the partially completed South Tower are seen in the background of the scenes at the shipyard following Devereaux's arrival in New York.\n\nFriedkin credits his decision to direct the movie to a discussion with film director [[Howard Hawks]], whose daughter was living with Friedkin at the time. Friedkin asked Hawks what he thought of his movies, to which Hawks bluntly replied that they were \"lousy.\" Instead Hawks recommended that he \"Make a good chase. Make one better than anyone's done.\"<ref>McCarthy, Todd.

He was strongly opposed to the choice of Hackman for the lead, and actually first considered [[Paul Newman]] (out of the budget range), then [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Peter Boyle]] and a New York columnist, [[Jimmy Breslin]], who had never acted before.<ref group=Note name=Making>Friedkin recounts his casting opinions in ''Making the Connection: The Untold Stories'' (2001). Extra feature on 2001 Five Star Collection edition of DVD release.</ref> However, Gleason, at that time, was considered box-office poison by the studio after his film ''[[Gigot (film)|Gigot]]'' had flopped several years before, Boyle declined the role after disapproving of the violent theme of the film, and Breslin refused to get behind the wheel of a car, which was required of Popeye's character for an integral [[car chase]] scene. [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] was also considered, but he did not want to do another police film after ''[[Bullitt]]'' and, as with Newman, his fee would have exceeded the movie's budget. Tough guy [[Charles Bronson]] was also considered for the role. Friedkin almost settled for [[Rod Taylor]] (who had actively pursued the role, according to Hackman), another choice the studio approved, before he went with Hackman.\n\nThe casting of Fernando Rey as the main French heroin smuggler, Alain Charnier (irreverently referred to throughout the film as \"Frog One\"), resulted from mistaken identity. Friedkin had seen [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s 1967 French film ''[[Belle de Jour (film)|Belle de Jour]]'' and had been impressed by the performance of [[Francisco Rabal]], who had a small role in the film. However, Friedkin did not know his name, and remembered only that he was a [[Spain|Spanish]] actor. He asked his casting director to find the actor, and the casting director instead contacted Rey, a Spanish actor who had appeared in several other films directed by Bu\u00f1uel. After Rabal was finally reached, they discovered he spoke neither French nor English, and Rey was kept in the film.<ref group=Note name=Making/> Ironically, after screening the film's final cut, Rey's French was deemed unacceptable by the filmmakers. They decided to dub his French while preserving his English dialogue.\n\n===Comparison to actual people===\nThe plot centers on drug smuggling in the 1960s and early 1970s, when most of the heroin illegally imported into the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] came to the United States through France (''see'' [[French Connection]]). In addition to the two main protagonists, several of the fictional characters depicted in the film also have real-life counterparts. The Alain Charnier character is based upon Jean Jehan who was arrested later in Paris for [[drug trafficking]], though he was not extradited since France does not extradite its citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=97174 |title=Turner Classic Movies spotlight |publisher= TCM|date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref> Sal Boca is based on Pasquale \"Patsy\" Fuca, and his brother Anthony. Angie Boca is based on Patsy's wife Barbara, who later wrote a book with [[Robin Moore]] detailing her life with Patsy. The Fucas and their uncle were part of a heroin dealing crew that worked with some of the New York City [[Five Families|crime families]].<ref>{{cite book| title= [[The French Connection (book)|The French Connection: A True Account of Cops, Narcotics, and International Conspiracy]]|year= 1969| ISBN= 1592280447 |first= Robin |last=Moore| authorlink= Robin Moore|page=}}{{Page needed|date=August 2014}}</ref> Henri Devereaux, who takes the fall for importing the Lincoln to New York City, is based on Jacques Angelvin, a television actor arrested and sentenced to three to six years in a federal penitentiary for his role, serving about four before returning to France and turning to real estate.<ref>{{cite book| first1=Alain |last1=Bauer| first2=Christophe|last2= Soullez | title= La criminologie pour les nuls| edition =G\u00e9n\u00e9rales First| year= 2012| ISBN=2754031626}}</ref> The Joel Weinstock character is, according to the director's commentary, a composite of several similar drug dealers.<ref>Film commentary{{Time needed|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Car chase===\nThe film is often cited as containing one of the greatest [[car chase]] sequences in movie history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6091432/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022044246/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6091432 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-10-22 |title=Top 10 car chase movies - MOVIES - MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref> The chase involves Popeye commandeering a civilian's car (a 1971 [[Pontiac LeMans]]) and then frantically chasing an [[elevated train]], on which a hitman is trying to escape. The scene was filmed in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn]] roughly running under the [[BMT West End Line]] (currently the {{NYCS trains|West End}}, then the [[B (New York City Subway service)|B]] train) which runs on an elevated track above Stillwell Avenue, 86th Street and New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn, with the chase ending just north of the [[62nd Street (BMT West End Line)|62nd Street]] station.  At that point, the train hits a [[train stop]], but is going too fast to stop in time and collides with the train ahead of it, which has just left the station.<ref group=Note>[[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42 cars]] 4572 and 4573 were chosen for the film and had no [[B (New York City Subway service)|B subway]] [[rollsign]]s because they were normally assigned to the [[N (New York City Subway service)|N subway train]]. Consequently, they operated during the movie with an N displayed. As of July 2009, these cars were withdrawn from service, but are preserved as part of the Transit Museum fleet.</ref>\n\nThe most famous shot of the chase is made from a front bumper mount and shows a low-angle point of view shot of the streets racing by. Director of photography [[Owen Roizman]] wrote in ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' magazine in 1972 that the camera was undercranked to 18 frames per second to enhance the sense of speed. Roizman's contention is borne out when you see a car at a red light whose muffler is pumping smoke at an accelerated rate. Other shots involved stunt drivers who were supposed to barely miss hitting the speeding car, but due to errors in timing, accidental collisions occurred and were left in the final film.<ref>This account of the shooting is described in ''Making the Connection'', supra.</ref> Friedkin said that he used [[Carlos Santana|Santana]]'s [[cover version|cover]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s song \"[[Black Magic Woman]]\" during editing to help shape the chase sequence; though the song does not appear in the film, \"it [the chase scene] did have a sort of pre-ordained rhythm to it that came from the music.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6070626 |title=\"From 'Popeye' Doyle to Puccini: William Friedkin\" with Robert Siegel (interview), NPR, 14 Sep 2006

them.<ref group=Note name=poster>A still shot from this scene is depicted in the movie poster shown at the top of this Wikipedia page.</ref> Many of the police officers acting as advisers for the film objected to the scene on the grounds that shooting a suspect in the back was simply murder, not self-defense, but director Friedkin stood by it, stating that he was \"secure in my conviction that that's exactly what [[Eddie Egan]] (the model for Doyle) would have done and Eddie was on the set while all of this was being shot.\"<ref>Director's commentary on DVD</ref><ref>\"Making the

Whereas in ''[[The Detective (1968 film)|The Detective]]'' or ''Bullitt'' the hero's attention was directed unmistakably towards liberal ends (crooked businessmen, corrupt local officials, etc.) Doyle spends a fair part of his time beating up sullen blacks in alleys and bars.

The screenplay, written by [[Ernest Tidyman]], is based on [[Robin Moore]]'s 1969 non-fiction book ''[[The French Connection (book)|The French Connection]]''. It tells the story of [[New York Police Department]] detectives [[Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle]] and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo, whose real-life counterparts were Narcotics Detectives [[Eddie Egan]] and [[Sonny Grosso]], in pursuit of wealthy French heroin smuggler Alain Charnier. The film stars [[Gene Hackman]] as Popeye, [[Roy Scheider]] as Cloudy, and [[Fernando Rey]] as Charnier. [[Tony Lo Bianco]] and [[Marcel Bozzuffi]] also star. [[The Three Degrees]] are featured in a nightclub scene.\n\nAt the [[44th Academy Awards]], it won the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Hackman), [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Friedkin), [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (Tidyman). It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Scheider), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]]. Tidyman also received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination, a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] and an [[Edgar Award]] for his [[screenplay]]. A sequel,   ''[[French Connection II]]'', followed in 1975 with Gene Hackman and Fernando Rey reprising their roles.\n\nThe [[American Film Institute]] included the film in its list of the best American films [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|in 1998]] and [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|again in 2007]].  In 2005 the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Marseille]], an undercover police detective follows Alain Charnier, who runs the world's largest heroin-smuggling syndicate. The policeman is assassinated by Charnier's hitman, Pierre Nicoli. Charnier plans to smuggle $32 million of heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, television personality Henri Devereaux, who is traveling to New York City by ship.\n\nIn New York City, detectives [[Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle]] and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo go out for drinks at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. Popeye notices Salvatore \"Sal\" Boca and his young wife, Angie, entertaining mobsters involved in narcotics. They tail the couple and establish a link between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock, who is part of the narcotics underworld.\n\nPopeye learns from an informant that a massive shipment of heroin will arrive in the next two weeks. The detectives convince their supervisor to wiretap the Bocas' phones. Popeye and Cloudy are joined by federal agents Mulderig and Klein.\n\nDevereaux's vehicle arrives in New York City. Boca is impatient to make the purchase\u2014reflecting Charnier's desire to return to France as soon as possible\u2014while Weinstock, with more experience in smuggling, urges patience, knowing Boca's phone is tapped and that they are being investigated.\n\nCharnier realizes he is being observed. He \"makes\" Popeye and escapes on a departing subway shuttle. To avoid being tailed, he has Boca meet him in Washington D.C., where Boca asks for a delay to avoid the police. Charnier, however, wants to conclude the deal quickly. On the flight back to New York City, Nicoli offers to kill Popeye, but Charnier objects, knowing that Popeye would be replaced by another policeman. Nicoli insists, however, saying they will be back in France before a replacement is assigned.\n\nSoon after, Nicoli attempts to shoot Popeye but misses. Popeye chases Nicoli, who boards an elevated train. Popeye commandeers a car and gives chase. Realizing he is being pursued, Nicoli works his way forward through the carriages, shoots a policeman who tries to intervene and hijacks the motorman at gunpoint, forcing him to drive straight through the next station, also shooting the train conductor. The motorman passes out and they are just about to slam into a stationary train when an emergency trackside brake engages, hurling the assassin against a glass window. Popeye arrives to see the killer descending from the platform. When the killer sees Popeye, he turns to run but is shot dead by Popeye.\n\nAfter a lengthy stakeout, Popeye impounds Devereaux's [[Lincoln Continental]]. He and his team take it apart searching for the drugs, but come up empty-handed. Cloudy notes that the vehicle's shipping weight is 120 pounds over its listed manufacturer's weight. They remove the rocker panels and discover the heroin concealed therein. The police restore the car to its original condition and return it to Devereaux, who delivers the Lincoln Continental to Charnier.\n\nCharnier drives to an old factory on [[Wards Island]] to meet Weinstock and deliver the drugs. After Charnier has the rocker panels removed, Weinstock's chemist tests one of the bags and confirms its quality. Charnier removes the drugs and hides the money, concealing it beneath the rocker panels of another car purchased at an auction of junk cars, which he will take back to France. Charnier and Sal drive off in the Lincoln, but hit a roadblock with a large contingent of police led by Popeye. The police chase the Lincoln back to the factory, where Boca is killed during a shootout while most of the other criminals surrender.\n\nCharnier escapes into the warehouse with Popeye and Cloudy in pursuit. Popeye sees a shadowy figure in the distance and opens fire a split-second after shouting a warning, killing Mulderig. Undaunted, Popeye tells Cloudy that he will get Charnier. After reloading his gun, Popeye runs into another room and a single gunshot is heard.\n\nTitle cards note that Weinstock was indicted but his case dismissed for \"lack of proper evidence\"; Angie Boca received a suspended sentence for an unspecified misdemeanor; Lou Boca received a reduced sentence; Devereaux served four years in a federal penitentiary for conspiracy; and Charnier was never caught. Popeye and Cloudy were transferred out of the narcotics division and reassigned.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Det.

The film was among the earliest to [[List of films featuring the World Trade Center|show the World Trade Center]]: the completed North Tower and the partially completed South Tower are seen in the background of the scenes at the shipyard following Devereaux's arrival in New York.\n\nFriedkin credits his decision to direct the movie to a discussion with film director [[Howard Hawks]], whose daughter was living with Friedkin at the time. Friedkin asked Hawks what he thought of his movies, to which Hawks bluntly replied that they were \"lousy.\" Instead Hawks recommended that he \"Make a good chase. Make one better than anyone's done.\"<ref>McCarthy, Todd.

Grove Press, 2000\n{{ISBN|0-8021-3740-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8021-3740-1}}\n</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nThough the cast ultimately proved to be one of the film's greatest strengths, Friedkin had problems with casting choices from the start. He was strongly opposed to the choice of Hackman for the lead, and actually first considered [[Paul Newman]] (out of the budget range), then [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Peter Boyle]] and a New York columnist, [[Jimmy Breslin]], who had never acted before.<ref group=Note name=Making>Friedkin recounts his casting opinions in ''Making the Connection: The Untold Stories'' (2001). Extra feature on 2001 Five Star Collection edition of DVD release.</ref> However, Gleason, at that time, was considered box-office poison by the studio after his film ''[[Gigot (film)|Gigot]]'' had flopped several years before, Boyle declined the role after disapproving of the violent theme of the film, and Breslin refused to get behind the wheel of a car, which was required of Popeye's character for an integral [[car chase]] scene. [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] was also considered, but he did not want to do another police film after ''[[Bullitt]]'' and, as with Newman, his fee would have exceeded the movie's budget. Tough guy [[Charles Bronson]] was also considered for the role. Friedkin almost settled for [[Rod Taylor]] (who had actively pursued the role, according to Hackman), another choice the studio approved, before he went with Hackman.\n\nThe casting of Fernando Rey as the main French heroin smuggler, Alain Charnier (irreverently referred to throughout the film as \"Frog One\"), resulted from mistaken identity. Friedkin had seen [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s 1967 French film ''[[Belle de Jour (film)|Belle de Jour]]'' and had been impressed by the performance of [[Francisco Rabal]], who had a small role in the film. However, Friedkin did not know his name, and remembered only that he was a [[Spain|Spanish]] actor. He asked his casting director to find the actor, and the casting director instead contacted Rey, a Spanish actor who had appeared in several other films directed by Bu\u00f1uel. After Rabal was finally reached, they discovered he spoke neither French nor English, and Rey was kept in the film.<ref group=Note name=Making/> Ironically, after screening the film's final cut, Rey's French was deemed unacceptable by the filmmakers. They decided to dub his French while preserving his English dialogue.\n\n===Comparison to actual people===\nThe plot centers on drug smuggling in the 1960s and early 1970s, when most of the heroin illegally imported into the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] came to the United States through France (''see'' [[French Connection]]). In addition to the two main protagonists, several of the fictional characters depicted in the film also have real-life counterparts. The Alain Charnier character is based upon Jean Jehan who was arrested later in Paris for [[drug trafficking]], though he was not extradited since France does not extradite its citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=97174 |title=Turner Classic Movies spotlight |publisher= TCM|date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref> Sal Boca is based on Pasquale \"Patsy\" Fuca, and his brother Anthony.

The scene was filmed in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn]] roughly running under the [[BMT West End Line]] (currently the {{NYCS trains|West End}}, then the [[B (New York City Subway service)|B]] train) which runs on an elevated track above Stillwell Avenue, 86th Street and New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn, with the chase ending just north of the [[62nd Street (BMT West End Line)|62nd Street]] station.  At that point, the train hits a [[train stop]], but is going too fast to stop in time and collides with the train ahead of it, which has just left the station.<ref group=Note>[[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42 cars]] 4572 and 4573 were chosen for the film and had no [[B (New York City Subway service)|B subway]] [[rollsign]]s because they were normally assigned to the [[N (New York City Subway service)|N subway train]]. Consequently, they operated during the movie with an N displayed. As of July 2009, these cars were withdrawn from service, but are preserved as part of the Transit Museum fleet.</ref>\n\nThe most famous shot of the chase is made from a front bumper mount and shows a low-angle point of view shot of the streets racing by. Director of photography [[Owen Roizman]] wrote in ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' magazine in 1972 that the camera was undercranked to 18 frames per second to enhance the sense of speed. Roizman's contention is borne out when you see a car at a red light whose muffler is pumping smoke at an accelerated rate. Other shots involved stunt drivers who were supposed to barely miss hitting the speeding car, but due to errors in timing, accidental collisions occurred and were left in the final film.<ref>This account of the shooting is described in ''Making the Connection'', supra.</ref> Friedkin said that he used [[Carlos Santana|Santana]]'s [[cover version|cover]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s song \"[[Black Magic Woman]]\" during editing to help shape the chase sequence; though the song does not appear in the film, \"it [the chase scene] did have a sort of pre-ordained rhythm to it that came from the music.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6070626 |title=\"From 'Popeye' Doyle to Puccini: William Friedkin\" with Robert Siegel (interview), NPR, 14 Sep 2006

them.<ref group=Note name=poster>A still shot from this scene is depicted in the movie poster shown at the top of this Wikipedia page.</ref> Many of the police officers acting as advisers for the film objected to the scene on the grounds that shooting a suspect in the back was simply murder, not self-defense, but director Friedkin stood by it, stating that he was \"secure in my conviction that

right for an out-and-out thriller like this, and I guess that you are supposed to think that a good old kind of movie has none too soon come around again. But ''The French Connection''&nbsp;... is in fact a very good new kind of movie, and that in spite of its being composed of such ancient material as cops and crooks, with thrills and chases, and lots of shoot-'em-up.\"<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173EE565BC4053DFB667838A669EDE | title= The French Connection (1971) |date= October 8, 1971| first= Roger |last= Greenspun | authorlink= Roger Greenspun| newspaper= The New York Times | accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref> A review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated, \"So many changes have been made in Robin Moore's taut, factual reprise of one of the biggest narcotics hauls in New York police history that only the skeleton remains, but producer Philip D'Antoni and screenwriter Ernest Tidyman have added enough fictional flesh to provide director William Friedkin and his overall topnotch cast with plenty of material, and they make the most of it.\"<ref>\"Film Reviews: The French Connection\". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.

''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, p. 20.</ref> [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it \"every bit as entertaining as 'Bullitt,' a slam-bang, suspenseful, plain-spoken, sardonically funny, furiously paced melodrama.

''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 1.</ref> Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the film \"an undeniably sensational movie, a fast, tense, explosively vicious little cops-and-robbers enterprise\" with \"a deliberately nervewracking, runaway quality ...

It is, I think, what we once feared mass entertainment might become: jolts for jocks. There's nothing in the movie that you enjoy thinking about afterward\u2014nothing especially clever except the timing of the subway-door-and-umbrella sequence.

''[[The New Yorker]]''. 115.</ref> [[David Pirie]] of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' called the film \"consistently exciting\" and Gene Hackman \"extremely convincing as Doyle, trailing his suspects with a shambling determination; but there are times when the film (or at any rate the script) seems to be applauding aspects of his character which are more repulsive than sympathetic. Whereas in ''[[The Detective (1968 film)|The Detective]]'' or ''Bullitt'' the hero's attention was directed unmistakably towards liberal ends (crooked businessmen, corrupt local officials, etc.) Doyle spends a fair part of his time beating up sullen blacks in alleys and bars. These violent sequences are almost all presented racily and amusingly, stressing Doyle's 'lovable' toughness as he manhandles and arrests petty criminals, usually adding a quip like 'Lock them up and throw away the key.'\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pirie |first=David |date=January 1972 |title=The French Connection |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=39 |issue=456 |page=7 }}</ref>\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 8.74/10.
