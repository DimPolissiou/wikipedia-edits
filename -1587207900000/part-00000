Each of Canada's physical therapy schools has transitioned from 3-year Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy (BScPT) programs that required 2 years of prerequisite university courses (5-year bachelor's degree) to 2-year Master's of Physical Therapy (MPT) programs that require prerequisite bachelor's degrees. The last Canadian university to follow suit was the University of Manitoba which transitioned to the MPT program in 2012, making the MPT credential the new entry to practice standard across Canada. Existing practitioners with BScPT credentials are not required to upgrade their qualifications.\n\nIn the province of Quebec, prospective physiotherapists are required to have completed a [[Diploma of Collegial Studies|college diploma]] in either health sciences, which lasts on average two years, or physical rehabilitation technology, which lasts at least three years, to apply to a physiotherapy program or program in university. Following admission, physical therapy students work on a bachelor of science with a major in physical therapy and rehabilitation. The B.Sc. usually requires three years to complete. Students must then enter graduate school to complete a master's degree in physical therapy, which normally requires one and a half to two years of study. Graduates who obtain their M.Sc. must successfully pass the membership examination to become member of the Ordre professionnel de la physioth\u00e9rapie du Qu\u00e9bec (OPPQ). Physiotherapists can pursue their education in such fields as rehabilitation sciences, sports medicine, kinesiology, and physiology.\n\nIn the province of Quebec, physical rehabilitation therapists are health care professionals who are required to complete a three-year college diploma program in physical rehabilitation therapy and be member of the ''Ordre professionnel de la physioth\u00e9rapie du Qu\u00e9bec'' (OPPQ) in order to practise legally in the country.\n\nMost physical rehabilitation therapists complete their [[Diploma of Collegial Studies|college diploma]] at [[Coll\u00e8ge Montmorency]], [[Dawson College]], or [[C\u00e9gep Marie-Victorin]], all situated in and around the [[Montreal]] area.\n\nAfter completing their technical college diploma, graduates have the opportunity to pursue their studies at the university level to perhaps obtain a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[physiotherapy]], [[kinesiology]], [[Exercise Science|exercise science]], or [[occupational therapy]]. The [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]], the [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]] and the [[Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke]] are among the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois universities that admit physical rehabilitation therapists in their programs of study related to health sciences and rehabilitation in order to credit courses that were completed in [[College education in Quebec|college]].\n\nTo date, there are no bridging programs available to facilitate upgrading from the BScPT to the MPT credential. However, research Master's of Science (MSc) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs are available at every university. Aside from academic research, practitioners can upgrade their skills and qualifications through continuing education courses and curriculums. Continuing education is a requirement of the provincial regulatory bodies.\n\nThe Canadian Alliance of Physiotherapy Regulators (CAPR) offers eligible program graduates to apply for the national Physiotherapy Competency Examination (PCE). Passing the PCE is one of the requirements in most provinces and territories to work as a licensed physiotherapist in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physiotherapy.ca/About-Physiotherapy/Careers-in-Physiotherapy|title=Career Centre \u2013 Canadian Physiotherapy Association}}</ref> CAPR has members which are physiotherapy regulatory organizations recognized in their respective provinces and territories:\n* Government of Yukon, Consumer Services\n* College of Physical Therapists of British Columbia\n* Physiotherapy Alberta College + Association\n* Saskatchewan College of Physical Therapists\n* College of Physiotherapists of Manitoba\n* College of Physiotherapists of Ontario\n* Ordre professionnel de la physioth\u00e9rapie du Qu\u00e9bec\n* College of Physiotherapists of New Brunswick/Coll\u00e8ge des physioth\u00e9rapeutes du Nouveau-Brunswick\n* Nova Scotia College of Physiotherapists\n* Prince Edward Island College of Physiotherapists\n* Newfoundland & Labrador College of Physiotherapists<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170921000728/https://physiotherapy.ca/newfoundlandlabrador-physiotherapy-association/ about_us.php]</ref>\n\nThe Canadian Physiotherapy Association offers a curriculum of continuing education courses in orthopaedics and manual therapy. The program consists of 5 levels (7 courses) of training with ongoing mentorship and evaluation at each level. The orthopaedic curriculum and examinations takes a minimum of 4 years to complete. However, upon completion of level 2, physiotherapists can apply to a unique 1-year course-based Master's program in advanced orthopaedics and manipulation at the University of Western Ontario to complete their training. This program accepts only 16 physiotherapists annually since 2007. Successful completion of either of these education streams and their respective examinations allows physiotherapists the opportunity to apply to the Canadian Academy of Manipulative Physiotherapy (CAMPT) for fellowship. Fellows of the Canadian Academy of manipulative Physiotherapists (FCAMPT) are considered leaders in the field, having extensive post-graduate education in orthopaedics and manual therapy. FCAMPT is an internationally recognized credential, as CAMPT is a member of the International Federation of Manipulative Physiotherapists (IFOMPT), a branch of the World Confederation of Physical Therapy (WCPT) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n===Scotland===\nPhysiotherapy degrees are offered at three universities: Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Glasgow Caledonian University in Glasgow and Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh. Students can qualify as physiotherapists by completing a four-year Bachelor of Science degree or a two-year master's degree (if they already have an undergraduate degree in a related field).\n\nIn order to use the title 'Physiotherapist', a student must register with the Health and Care Professions Council, a UK wide regulatory body, on qualifying. Many physiotherapists are also members of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists (CSP), who provides insurance and professional support.\n\n===United States===\nThe primary physical therapy practitioner is the Physical Therapist (PT) who is trained and licensed to examine, evaluate, diagnose and treat impairment, functional limitations and disabilities in patients or clients.

Soon following American orthopedic surgeons began treating children with disabilities and began employing women trained in physical education, and remedial exercise. These treatments were applied and promoted further during the Polio outbreak of 1916. During the First World War, women were recruited to work with and restore physical function to injured soldiers, and the field of physical therapy was institutionalized. In 1918 the term \"Reconstruction Aide\" was used to refer to individuals practicing physical therapy. The first school of physical therapy was established at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C., following the outbreak of World War I.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/mowihsp/health/PTdevel.htm|title=Missouri Women in the Health Sciences \u2013 Health Professions \u2013 Development of the Field of Physical Therapy}}</ref> Research catalyzed the physical therapy movement. The first physical therapy research was published in the United States in March 1921 in \"The PT Review.\" In the same year, Mary McMillan organized the American Women's Physical Therapeutic Association (now called the [[American Physical Therapy Association]] (APTA). In 1924, the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation promoted the field by touting physical therapy as a treatment for [[polio]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute|title=History|work=About Us|publisher=Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute|url=http://www.rooseveltrehab.org/history.php|accessdate=29 May 2008}}</ref>\nTreatment through the 1940s primarily consisted of [[exercise]], massage, and [[traction (orthopedics)|traction]].

Specialization for physical therapy in the U.S. occurred in 1974, with the Orthopaedic Section of the APTA being formed for those physical therapists specializing in orthopaedics. In the same year, the [[International Federation of Orthopaedic Manipulative Physical Therapists]] was formed,<ref name=IFOMPT_history>{{cite web|last=Basson|first=Annalie|title=History: Abridged version of IFOMPT History|publisher=International Federation of Orthopaedic Manipulative Physical Therapists (IFOMPT)|year=2010|url=http://www.ifompt.com/About+IFOMPT/History.html|accessdate=9 January 2011}}</ref> which has ever since played an important role in advancing manual therapy worldwide.\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Physical therapy education}}\nEducational criteria for physical therapy providers vary from state to state and from country to country, and among various levels of professional responsibility. Most [[U.S. state]]s have [[physical therapy practice act]]s that recognize both physical therapists (PT) and physical therapist assistants (PTA) and some jurisdictions also recognize physical therapy technicians (PT Techs) or aides. Most countries have licensing bodies that require physical therapists to be a member of before they can start practicing as independent professionals.\n\n===Canada===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2018}}\n\nCanadian physiotherapy programs are offered at 15 universities, often through the university's respective college of medicine. Each of Canada's physical therapy schools has transitioned from 3-year Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy (BScPT) programs that required 2 years of prerequisite university courses (5-year bachelor's degree) to 2-year Master's of Physical Therapy (MPT) programs that require prerequisite bachelor's degrees. The last Canadian university to follow suit was the University of Manitoba which transitioned to the MPT program in 2012, making the MPT credential the new entry to practice standard across Canada. Existing practitioners with BScPT credentials are not required to upgrade their qualifications.\n\nIn the province of Quebec, prospective physiotherapists are required to have completed a [[Diploma of Collegial Studies|college diploma]] in either health sciences, which lasts on average two years, or physical rehabilitation technology, which lasts at least three years, to apply to a physiotherapy program or program in university. Following admission, physical therapy students work on a bachelor of science with a major in physical therapy and rehabilitation. The B.Sc. usually requires three years to complete. Students must then enter graduate school to complete a master's degree in physical therapy, which normally requires one and a half to two years of study. Graduates who obtain their M.Sc. must successfully pass the membership examination to become member of the Ordre professionnel de la physioth\u00e9rapie du Qu\u00e9bec (OPPQ). Physiotherapists can pursue their education in such fields as rehabilitation sciences, sports medicine, kinesiology, and physiology.\n\nIn the province of Quebec, physical rehabilitation therapists are health care professionals who are required to complete a three-year college diploma program in physical rehabilitation therapy and be member of the ''Ordre professionnel de la physioth\u00e9rapie du Qu\u00e9bec'' (OPPQ) in order to practise legally in the country.\n\nMost physical rehabilitation therapists complete their [[Diploma of Collegial Studies|college diploma]] at [[Coll\u00e8ge Montmorency]], [[Dawson College]], or [[C\u00e9gep Marie-Victorin]], all situated in and around the [[Montreal]] area.\n\nAfter completing their technical college diploma, graduates have the opportunity to pursue their studies at the university level to perhaps obtain a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[physiotherapy]], [[kinesiology]], [[Exercise Science|exercise science]], or [[occupational therapy]]. The [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]], the [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]] and the [[Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke]] are among the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois universities that admit physical rehabilitation therapists in their programs of study related to health sciences and rehabilitation in order to credit courses that were completed in [[College education in Quebec|college]].\n\nTo date, there are no bridging programs available to facilitate upgrading from the BScPT to the MPT credential. However, research Master's of Science (MSc) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs are available at every university. Aside from academic research, practitioners can upgrade their skills and qualifications through continuing education courses and curriculums. Continuing education is a requirement of the provincial regulatory bodies.\n\nThe Canadian Alliance of Physiotherapy Regulators (CAPR) offers eligible program graduates to apply for the national Physiotherapy Competency Examination (PCE). Passing the PCE is one of the requirements in most provinces and territories to work as a licensed physiotherapist in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physiotherapy.ca/About-Physiotherapy/Careers-in-Physiotherapy|title=Career Centre \u2013 Canadian Physiotherapy Association}}</ref> CAPR has members which are physiotherapy regulatory organizations recognized in their respective provinces and territories:\n* Government of Yukon, Consumer Services\n* College of Physical Therapists of British Columbia\n* Physiotherapy Alberta College + Association\n* Saskatchewan College of Physical Therapists\n* College of Physiotherapists of Manitoba\n* College of Physiotherapists of Ontario\n* Ordre professionnel de la physioth\u00e9rapie du Qu\u00e9bec\n* College of Physiotherapists of New Brunswick/Coll\u00e8ge des physioth\u00e9rapeutes du Nouveau-Brunswick\n* Nova Scotia College of Physiotherapists\n* Prince Edward Island College of Physiotherapists\n* Newfoundland & Labrador College of Physiotherapists<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170921000728/https://physiotherapy.ca/newfoundlandlabrador-physiotherapy-association/ about_us.php]</ref>\n\nThe Canadian Physiotherapy Association offers a curriculum of continuing education courses in orthopaedics and manual therapy. The program consists of 5 levels (7 courses) of training with ongoing mentorship and evaluation at each level. The orthopaedic curriculum and examinations takes a minimum of 4 years to complete. However, upon completion of level 2, physiotherapists can apply to a unique 1-year course-based Master's program in advanced orthopaedics and manipulation at the University of Western Ontario to complete their training. This program accepts only 16 physiotherapists annually since 2007. Successful completion of either of these education streams and their respective examinations allows physiotherapists the opportunity to apply to the Canadian Academy of Manipulative Physiotherapy (CAMPT) for fellowship. Fellows of the Canadian Academy of manipulative Physiotherapists (FCAMPT) are considered leaders in the field, having extensive post-graduate education in orthopaedics and manual therapy. FCAMPT is an internationally recognized credential, as CAMPT is a member of the International Federation of Manipulative Physiotherapists (IFOMPT), a branch of the World Confederation of Physical Therapy (WCPT) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n===Scotland===\nPhysiotherapy degrees are offered at three universities: Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Glasgow Caledonian University in Glasgow and Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh. Students can qualify as physiotherapists by completing a four-year Bachelor of Science degree or a two-year master's degree (if they already have an undergraduate degree in a related field).\n\nIn order to use the title 'Physiotherapist', a student must register with the Health and Care Professions Council, a UK wide regulatory body, on qualifying. Many physiotherapists are also members of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists (CSP), who provides insurance and professional support.\n\n===United States===\nThe primary physical therapy practitioner is the Physical Therapist (PT) who is trained and licensed to examine, evaluate, diagnose and treat impairment, functional limitations and disabilities in patients or clients.

The players alternate in striking the ball with their racquets onto the playable surfaces of the four walls of the court. The objective of the game is to hit the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. About 20 million people play squash regularly world-wide in over 185 countries.<ref>https://www.ussquash.com/squash-facts/</ref> The governing body of Squash, the [[World Squash Federation]] (WSF), is recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), but the sport is not part of the [[Olympic Games]], despite a number of applications. Supporters continue to lobby for its incorporation in a future [[Olympic sports|Olympic program]].\n\n[[File:Mathieu Castagnet Nantes 2017.jpg|thumb|[[Mathieu Castagnet]] at Nantes Squash Tournament in 2017]]\n\n==History==\nSquash has its origins in the older game of [[rackets (sport)|rackets]] which was played in London's prisons in the 18th century. Later, around 1830, boys at the [[Harrow School]] noticed that a punctured ball, which \"squashed\" on impact with the wall, offered more variety to the game. The game spread to other schools. The first courts built at the Harrow School were dangerous because they were near water pipes, buttresses, chimneys, and ledges. [[Natural rubber]] was the preferred material for the ball. Students modified their rackets to have a smaller reach and improve their ability to play in these cramped conditions.<ref name=\"zug\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ussquash.com/functions/content.aspx?id=1252|title=History of Squash|last=Zug|first=James|work=US Squash|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717181310/http://www.ussquash.com/functions/content.aspx?id=1252|archivedate=17 July 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=17 January 2011}}</ref> In 1864, the school built four outside courts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/commonwealthgames2002/hi/squash/newsid_1962000/1962068.stm|title=From prison rackets to squash racquets|date=2002-06-26|access-date=2019-07-22|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century the game increased in popularity with various schools, clubs and private individuals building squash courts, but with no set dimensions. The first squash court in North America was at [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], [[New Hampshire]] in 1884. In 1904 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the earliest national association of squash in the world, the United States Squash rackets Association (USSRA), now known as [[U.S. Squash]], was formed. In April 1907 the Tennis, Rackets & Fives Association set up a sub committee to set standards for squash. Then the sport soon formed, combining the three sports together called \u201cSquash\u201d. In 1912, the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] had a squash court in [[First class facilities of the RMS Titanic|first class]]. The 1st-Class Squash Court was situated on G-Deck and the Spectators Viewing Gallery was on the deck above on F-Deck. To use the Court cost 50 cents in 1912. Passengers could use the court for one hour unless others were waiting. It was not until 1923 that the [[Royal Automobile Club]] hosted a meeting to further discuss the rules and regulations and another five years elapsed before the Squash rackets Association was formed to set standards for squash in [[Great Britain]].<ref name=zug/>\n\nSquash rackets have changed in a similar way to tennis rackets. In the 1980s, construction shifted from laminated timber<ref name=\"GRAYS\">[http://squash.as/grays/history.php \"Grays of Cambridge: History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706085116/http://squash.as/grays/history.php |date=2011-07-06 }} - makers of rackets and founded in 1855 by Henry John Gray, the Champion rackets Player of England. \"In those days, the rackets were made from one piece English ash, with a suede leather grip and natural gut. ... The 1980s witnessed a period of re-structuring and consolidation. The Cambridge rackets factory was forced to close in face of the move to graphite rackets, and production was moved to the Far East.\"</ref> to lighter materials (such as aluminum and graphite) with small additions of components like Kevlar, boron and titanium. Natural \"gut\" strings were also replaced with synthetic strings.<ref name=\"GRAYS\"/> Customization of squash rackets has grown over the years as well. There are custom variations on racket head shape, racket balance, and racket weight. The most common racket variation for international singles squash is a teardrop (closed throat) head shape, even balance and racket weight of 130g. For hardball doubles, the most common variation is an open throat head shape, even balance and racket weight of 140g.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bosssquash.com/blog/best-squash-racquet/|title=Best Squash Racquet 2019 - 8 Racquets to ELEVATE Your Game|date=2019-03-05|website=BossSquash|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n\nThere are several variations of squash played across the world, although the international version of the sport has become the dominant form. In the United States, a variant of squash known as [[hardball squash|hardball]] was traditionally played with a harder ball and different sized courts. Hardball squash has lost much of its popularity in North America (in favor of the international version). There is also a tennis-like variation of squash known as [[squash tennis]]. Finally, [[racketball]], a similar sport, is also played in the United States.\nThe current world number 1 is Aly Farag from Egypt.\n\n==Playing equipment==\n[[File:Nanoldsquash2.JPG|right|thumb|Old and new style squash rackets]]\nSquash rackets have maximum dimensions of 686&nbsp;mm (27.0&nbsp;in) long and 215&nbsp;mm (8.5&nbsp;in) wide, with a maximum strung area of 500 square centimeters (77.5&nbsp;sq&nbsp;in). The permitted maximum weight is {{convert|255|g}}, but most have a weight between 90 and 150&nbsp;grams (3\u20135.3&nbsp;oz.).\n\n[[File:Squash Ball Dunlop Revelation Pro 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A squash ball]]\nSquash balls are between 39.5 and 40.5&nbsp;mm in diameter, and weigh 23 to 25&nbsp;grams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squashplayer.co.uk/squash_balls.htm |title=Squash Balls |publisher=Squashplayer.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> They are made with two pieces of rubber compound, glued together to form a hollow sphere and buffed to a matte finish. Different balls are provided for varying temperature and atmospheric conditions and standards of play: more experienced players use slow balls that have less bounce than those used by less experienced players (slower balls tend to \"die\" in court corners, rather than \"standing up\" to allow easier shots). Squash balls must be hit dozens of times to warm them up at the beginning of a session; cold squash balls have very little bounce. Small colored dots on the ball indicate its dynamic level (bounciness). \nThe \"double-yellow dot\" ball, introduced in 2000, is the competition standard, replacing the earlier \"yellow-dot\" ball. There is also an \"orange dot\" ball for use at high altitudes. The recognized colors are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Colour !! Speed (of Play) !! Bounce !! Player Level\n|-\n| Double yellow || Extra Slow || Very low || Experienced\n|-\n| Yellow ||  Slow || Low || Advanced\n|-\n| Red || Medium || High || Medium\n|-\n| Blue || Fast || Very high || Beginner/Junior\n|}\n\nSome ball manufacturers such as Dunlop use a different method of grading balls based on experience. They still have the equivalent dot rating, but are named to help choose a ball that is appropriate for one's skill level. The four different ball types are Intro (Blue dot, 140% of Pro bounce), Progress (Red dot, 120% of Pro bounce), Competition (single yellow dot, 110% of Pro bounce) and Pro (double yellow dot).\n\nMany squash venues mandate the use of shoes with non marking tread and eye protection. Some associations require that all juniors and doubles players must wear eye protection. The [[National Institutes of Health]] recommends wearing goggles with polycarbonate lenses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nei.nih.gov/sports/findingprotection.asp |title=Sports, For Parents, Teachers and Coaches, National Eye Institute [NEI&#93; |publisher=Nei.nih.gov |accessdate=2013-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427122830/http://www.nei.nih.gov/sports/findingprotection.asp |archive-date=2013-04-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===The court===\n[[File:Squash Court.svg|thumb]]\nThe squash court is a playing surface surrounded by four walls. The court surface contains a front line separating the front and back of the court and a half court line, separating the left and right sides of the back portion of the court, creating three 'boxes': the front half, the back left quarter and the back right quarter. Both the back two boxes contain smaller service boxes.\n\nThe court's four walls are divided into a front wall, two side walls, and a back wall. An 'out line' runs along the top of the front wall, descending along the side walls to the back wall. The bottom line of the front wall marks the top of the 'tin', a half meter-high metal area. The middle line of the front wall is the service line. The dimensions of the court are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asbsquash.com/faq/squash-court-construction/|title=Squash Court Construction: \"How to build a Court?\" - ASB SquashCourt|website=asbsquash.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-25}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

With double the amount of players, the doubles court needs to be significantly bigger than a singles court. The doubles court should measure 25 feet wide by 45 feet long and have a ceiling height of at least 24 feet but preferably 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bosssquash.com/blog/squash-sport/|title=Squash: The Definitive Guide (and How You Can Start to Play Today)|date=2019-08-14|website=BossSquash|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref>\n\n===Service===\nThe players spin a racket to decide who serves first. This player starts the first rally by electing to serve from either the left or right service box. For a legal serve, one of the server's feet must be in the service box, not touching any part of the service box lines, as the player strikes the ball. After being struck by the racket, the ball must strike the front wall above the service line and below the out line and land in the opposite back quarter court. The receiving player can choose to [[Squash (sport)#Types of shots played|volley]] a serve after it has hit the front wall. If the server wins the point, the two players switch sides for the following point. If the server loses the point, the opponent then serves, and can serve from either box.\n\n===Play===\nAfter the serve, the players take turns hitting the ball against the front wall, above the tin and below the out line. The ball may strike the side or back walls at any time, as long as it hits below the out line. It must not hit the floor after hitting the racket and before hitting the front wall. A ball landing on either the out line or the line along the top of the tin is considered to be out. After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to bounce once on the floor (and any number of times against the side or back walls) before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player's movements is forbidden and could result in a let or a stroke. Players typically return to the centre of the court after making a shot.\n\n===Scoring system===\nGames are played according to point-a-rally scoring (PARS) to 11 points. PARS is almost universally preferred by the game's top professionals, and is the current official scoring system for all levels of professional squash tournaments. In PARS, the winner of a rally receives a point, regardless of whether they were the server or returner. Games are played to 11 and must be won by two points. That is, if the score reaches 10\u201310, play continues until one player wins by two points. Competition matches are usually played to \"best-of-five\" games (i.e. the first player to win three games).\n\nSquash can also be played with different scoring systems such as PARS to 15, traditional English or Hand-In-Hand-Out (HiHo) scoring to 9, or RAM scoring (see below). Players often experience PARS and Hi-Ho as requiring different tactics and player attributes.\n\n=== Other scoring systems ===\n\n====PARS to 15====\nPoint-a-rally scoring to 15 was used for the [[World Squash Championships|World Championships]] between 1989 and 2003. PARS to 15, with the tiebreak being two clear points (as per standard PARS) from 14-14, was used in many amateur leagues because PARS to 11 was considered too short.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kent-squash.co.uk/par-scoring-less-squash/|title=PAR scoring equals less squash}}</ref> This system fell out of favor in 2004 when the [[Professional Squash Association]] (PSA) decided to switch to PARS to 11. Games were considered to last too long and the winner would usually be the fitter player, not necessarily the better player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://squashclub.org/main/e-lessons/lessons/intermediate_lessons/faq/faq.shtml|title=Frequently asked questions on squash - general squash tips|website=squashclub.org}}</ref>\n\n====English or HiHo to 9 Scoring====\nKnown as English or hand-in-hand-out scoring, under this system, if the server wins a rally, they receive a point, while if the returner wins rally, only the service changes (i.e.,\nthe ball goes \"hand-out\") and no point is given. The first player to reach nine points wins the game. However, if the score reaches 8\u20138, the player who was first to reach eight decides whether the game will be played to nine, as before (called \"set one\"), or to 10 (called \"set two\"). This scoring system was formerly preferred in Britain, and also among countries with traditional British ties, such as Australia, Canada, Pakistan, South Africa, India and Sri Lanka.\n\n====RAM Scoring====\nThe RAM scoring system is a new scoring system created by former World Champion, [[Ramy Ashour]] and co-founded by Osama Khalifa. This consists of playing a best of five games. Each game is three minutes long; however, this only refers to the three minutes in play. The 'downtime' in between the end of a rally and a serve is not counted. Once the time is up, the clock stops, and the leading player needs to win a final point. If the player who is behind wins the point the game continues until the trailing player catches up and wins one more point than the initially leading player.\n\nFor example, Player one is leading 5-3 and the clock stops. Player two wins the next two points and the score is 5-5. Whoever wins the next point wins the game. This is called sudden death. If the score is 0-0 when the clock stops the clock is reset and the game restarts. For Let Calls the clock reverts to the start time of that point. Further rules include that there must be a referee and a time keeper to make this match official. Players have two minutes of rest between games, and all other standard PSA and WSF rules apply.<ref>http://ramscoring.com/ram-scoring-system.html</ref>\n\n===Transition from English/Hand-In-Hand-Out to PARS 11 scoring===\nIn 2004, the [[Professional Squash Association]] (PSA) decided to switch to PARS to 11. This decision was ratified in 2009 when the [[World Squash Federation]] confirmed the switch to the PARS 11 scoring system.<ref>https://www.theworldgames.org/news/The-World-Games-17/squash--new-scoring-system-438</ref> Since that time, almost all professional and league games have been played according to PARS to 11. One of the reasons for switching to PARS was that long, taxing matches became less frequent and promoters could more easily predict match and session length. [[Gawain Briars]], who served as the Executive Director of the Professional Squash Association when the body decided to switch to PARS in 2004 hoped that PARS would make the \"professional game more exciting to watch, [and] then more people will become involved in the game and our chances of Olympic entry may be enhanced.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.squashplayer.co.uk/superseries/superseries_org/newscoring.htm|title=New Scoring System|website=www.squashplayer.co.uk|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref> [[File:Squash Tournament of Champions 2019, Grand Central Station, NYC.jpg|thumb|[[Tournament of Champions (squash)|Tournament of Champions]] 2019, Grand Central Station, NYC]]\nOne of the problems with English or Hi-Ho scoring is that games often last longer as players continually win service before losing service to the other player without the score being affected. Consequently, the winner is more often than not the fitter athlete. Moreover, English or Hi-Ho scoring can encourage players to play defensively with the aim of wearing down one's opponent before winning by virtue of one's fitness. Such exhausting, defensive play can affect player's prospects in knock-out tournaments and does not make for riveting TV. In English or Hi-Ho, one player might win by 9-0 despite the opponent having repeatedly won service, but without converting that service into actual points.\n\nFor the World Championships: HiHo to 9 was used until 1988; PARS to 15 from 1989 to 2003; and PARS to 11 from 2004. For the British Open: HiHo to 9 was used until 1994; PARS to 15 from 1995 to 2003; and PARS to 11 from 2004.<ref>http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/data-science/squash-scoring.html</ref>\n\nThe WSF's decision to switch to PARS 11 proved controversial in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth where games were usually played according to English or Hi-Ho. When the Veterans Squash Rackets Club of Great Britain surveyed their members in 2012, they found that 80% of their members were against switching from HiHo to PARS.<ref name=\"Gilmour\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/squash/9327497/Squash-scoring-changes-will-kill-essence-of-the-game-say-top-British-veterans.html|title=Squash scoring changes will 'kill essence of the game', say top British veterans|last=Gilmour|first=Rod|date=2012-06-13|access-date=2019-01-04|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> President Philip Ayton argued that PARS would \"kill the essence of the game.\"<ref name=\"Gilmour\"/> Ayton was particularly concerned that the \"great comebacks\" that characterised English or Hi-Ho when \"the player who is down in a game can still attack when in hand serving\"<ref name=\"Gilmour\"/> would disappear as PARS fostered an \"ultra-defensive attitude, because every rally counts the same.\"<ref name=\"Gilmour\"/> [[Jahangir Khan]] has countered that PARS actually made the game far more attacking, but diminished the psychological aspect of the game: \"With the nine points scoring system, matches were more mental and physical and could go longer, but now with the 11-point system, every rally counts, and even if you go behind you can still recover. That makes it a lot more attacking.\" Maj Madan, one the game's top referees, similarly stated that PARS had \"destroyed the fitness element and, more importantly, the cerebral magic of the\u2026game.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://squashmagazine.ussquash.com/2011/08/wills-world-the-referees-call/|title=Will\u2019s World The Referees\u2019 Call {{!}} Squash Magazine|website=squashmagazine.ussquash.com|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref> His comments were unearthed when an email chain of referees discussing the problem of shorter and shorter squash matches was leaked in 2011.\n[[File:Squash Played at the Pyramids of Egypt.jpg|thumb|Squash Played at the Pyramids of Egypt]]\n\n===Strategy and tactics===\nA key strategy in squash is known as \"dominating the T\" (the intersection of the red lines near the centre of the court, shaped like the letter \"T\", where the player is in the best position to retrieve the opponent's next shot). Skilled players will return a shot, and then move back toward the \"T\" before playing the next shot. From this position, the player can quickly access any part of the court to retrieve the opponent's next shot with a minimum of movement and possibly maximising the movement required by the opponent to answer the returned shot.\n\nA common tactic is to hit the ball straight up the side walls to the back corners; this is the basic squash shot, referred to as a \"rail,\" straight drive, wall, or \"length\". After hitting this shot, the player will then move to the centre of the court near the \"T\" to be well placed to retrieve the opponent's return. Attacking with soft or \"short\" shots to the front corners (referred to as \"drop shots\") causes the opponent to cover more of the court and may result in an outright winner.  Boasts or angle shots are deliberately struck off one of the side walls before the ball reaches the front. They are used for deception and again to cause the opponent to cover more of the court. Rear wall shots float to the front either straight or diagonally drawing the opponent to the front. Advantageous tactical shots are available in response to a weak return by the opponent if stretched, the majority of the court being free to the striker.\n\nRallies between experienced players may involve 30 or more shots and therefore a very high premium is placed on fitness, both aerobic and anaerobic. As players become more skilled and, in particular, better able to retrieve shots, points often become a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. At higher levels of the game, the fitter player has a major advantage.\n\nThe ability to change the direction of the ball at the last instant is also a tactic used to unbalance the opponent. Expert players can anticipate the opponent's shot a few tenths of a second before the average player, giving them a chance to react sooner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/visual-acuity-and-reaction-times |title=Agility Training: Improving Sporting Reaction Times |publisher=Pponline.co.uk |accessdate=2013-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505222112/http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/visual-acuity-and-reaction-times |archive-date=2013-05-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>[[File:US Open Squash Championship 2011 Drexel University.jpg|thumb|The glass show court used at the 2011 US Open Squash Championships hosted by Drexel University at the [[Daskalakis Athletic Center]].<br /> 2 points during the Semi Final between [[James Willstrop]] and [[Nick Matthew]] in 2011  :<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgw68AaGWhQ |title=Squash : Nick Matthew v James Wilstrop : 2011 Delaware Investments U.S. Squash Open |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2013-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uKoYDCcyy0 |title=Squash : Nick Matthew v James Wilstrop : 2011 Delaware Investments U.S. Open Squash |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18}}</ref>]]\n\nDepending on the style of play, it is common to refer to squash players<ref>Strategies, Jonathon Power Exposed DVD 2.</ref><ref>Commentary by Jonathon Power and Martin Heath, TOC, 2005</ref> as\n\n* Power players: powerful shots to take time away from their opponent. For example, [[John White (squash player)|John White]], [[Omar Mosaad]], [[Mohammed Sadiq (squash player)|Mohammed Sadiq]].\n* Shot makers: accurate shots to take time away from their opponent. For example, [[Jonathon Power]], [[Ramy Ashour]], [[Amr Shabana]], [[James Willstrop]].\n* Retrievers: excellent retrieval to counter power and accuracy and to return shots more quickly to take time away from their opponent. For example, [[Peter Nicol]], [[Gr\u00e9gory Gaultier]], [[Nicol David]], [[Mohamed El Shorbagy]].\n* Attritional players: a consistently high-paced game both from shot speed and running speed to wear their opponent down over time. For example, [[David Palmer (squash player)|David Palmer]], [[Nick Matthew]], [[Jansher Khan]], [[Jahangir Khan]].\n\n===Interference and obstruction===\nInterference and obstruction are an inevitable aspect of squash, since two players are confined within a shared space. Generally, the rules entitle players to a direct straight line access to the ball, room for a reasonable swing and an unobstructed shot to any part of the front wall. When interference occurs, a player may appeal for a \"let\" and the referee (or the players themselves if there is no official) then interprets the extent of the interference. The referee may allow a let and the players then replay the point, or award a \"stroke\" to the appealing player (meaning that he is declared the winner of that point) depending on the degree of interference, whether the interfering player made an adequate effort to avoid interfering, and whether the player interfered with was likely to have hit a winning shot had the interference not occurred. An exception occurs when the interfering player is directly in the path of the other player's swing, effectively preventing the swing, in which case a stroke is always awarded.\n\nWhen it is deemed that there has been little or no interference, the rules provide that no let is to be allowed in the interests of continuity of play and the discouraging of spurious appeals for lets. Because of the subjectivity in interpreting the nature and magnitude of interference, awarding (or withholding) of lets and strokes is often controversial.\n\n[[File:Open International de Squash de Nantes 2017.jpg|thumb|A glasscourt, under Naves, in [[Open International de Squash de Nantes|Nantes]] in France]]\n\nInterference also occurs when a player's shot hits their opponent prior to hitting the front wall. If the ball was travelling towards the side wall when it hit the opponent, or if it had already hit the side wall and was travelling directly to the front wall, it is usually a let. However, it is a stroke to the player who hit the ball if the ball was travelling straight to the front wall when the ball hit the opponent, without having first hit the side wall. Generally after a player has been hit by the ball, both players stand still; if the struck player is standing directly in front of the player who hit the ball he loses the stroke; if he is not straight in front, a let is played. If it is deemed that the player who is striking the ball is deliberately trying to hit his opponent, they will lose the stroke. An exception occurs when the player hitting the ball has \"turned\", i.e., letting the ball pass them on one side, but then hitting it on the other side as it came off the back wall. In these cases, the stroke goes to the player who was hit by the ball.\n\n===Referee===\nThe referee is usually a certified position issued by the club or assigned squash league. Any conflict or interference is dealt with by the referee. The referee may also take away points or games due to improper etiquette regarding conduct or rules. The referee is also usually responsible for the scoring of games. Three referees are usually used in professional tournaments. The Central referee has responsibility to call the score and make decisions with the two side referees.\n\n==Contribution to health==\nSquash provides an excellent cardiovascular workout. Players can expend approximately 600 to 1,000 food [[calorie]]s (3,000 to 4,000 [[kilojoule|kJ]]) every hour playing squash according to English or Hi-Ho scoring.<ref name=\"santelmann2003\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/2003/09/30/cx_ns_1001featslide.html?thisSpeed=20000 |title=Santelmann, N. 2003.

Later, around 1830, boys at the [[Harrow School]] noticed that a punctured ball, which \"squashed\" on impact with the wall, offered more variety to the game. The game spread to other schools. The first courts built at the Harrow School were dangerous because they were near water pipes, buttresses, chimneys, and ledges. [[Natural rubber]] was the preferred material for the ball. Students modified their rackets to have a smaller reach and improve their ability to play in these cramped conditions.<ref name=\"zug\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ussquash.com/functions/content.aspx?id=1252|title=History of Squash|last=Zug|first=James|work=US Squash|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717181310/http://www.ussquash.com/functions/content.aspx?id=1252|archivedate=17 July 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=17 January 2011}}</ref> In 1864, the school built four outside courts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/commonwealthgames2002/hi/squash/newsid_1962000/1962068.stm|title=From prison rackets to squash racquets|date=2002-06-26|access-date=2019-07-22|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century the game increased in popularity with various schools, clubs and private individuals building squash courts, but with no set dimensions. The first squash court in North America was at [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], [[New Hampshire]] in 1884. In 1904 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the earliest national association of squash in the world, the United States Squash rackets Association (USSRA), now known as [[U.S. Squash]], was formed. In April 1907 the Tennis, Rackets & Fives Association set up a sub committee to set standards for squash. Then the sport soon formed, combining the three sports together called \u201cSquash\u201d. In 1912, the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] had a squash court in [[First class facilities of the RMS Titanic|first class]]. The 1st-Class Squash Court was situated on G-Deck and the Spectators Viewing Gallery was on the deck above on F-Deck. To use the Court cost 50 cents in 1912. Passengers could use the court for one hour unless others were waiting. It was not until 1923 that the [[Royal Automobile Club]] hosted a meeting to further discuss the rules and regulations and another five years elapsed before the Squash rackets Association was formed to set standards for squash in [[Great Britain]].<ref name=zug/>\n\nSquash rackets have changed in a similar way to tennis rackets. In the 1980s, construction shifted from laminated timber<ref name=\"GRAYS\">[http://squash.as/grays/history.php \"Grays of Cambridge: History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706085116/http://squash.as/grays/history.php |date=2011-07-06 }} - makers of rackets and founded in 1855 by Henry John Gray, the Champion rackets Player of England. \"In those days, the rackets were made from one piece English ash, with a suede leather grip and natural gut. ... The 1980s witnessed a period of re-structuring and consolidation. The Cambridge rackets factory was forced to close in face of the move to graphite rackets, and production was moved to the Far East.\"</ref> to lighter materials (such as aluminum and graphite) with small additions of components like Kevlar, boron and titanium. Natural \"gut\" strings were also replaced with synthetic strings.<ref name=\"GRAYS\"/> Customization of squash rackets has grown over the years as well. There are custom variations on racket head shape, racket balance, and racket weight. The most common racket variation for international singles squash is a teardrop (closed throat) head shape, even balance and racket weight of 130g. For hardball doubles, the most common variation is an open throat head shape, even balance and racket weight of 140g.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bosssquash.com/blog/best-squash-racquet/|title=Best Squash Racquet 2019 - 8 Racquets to ELEVATE Your Game|date=2019-03-05|website=BossSquash|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n\nThere are several variations of squash played across the world, although the international version of the sport has become the dominant form. In the United States, a variant of squash known as [[hardball squash|hardball]] was traditionally played with a harder ball and different sized courts. Hardball squash has lost much of its popularity in North America (in favor of the international version). There is also a tennis-like variation of squash known as [[squash tennis]]. Finally, [[racketball]], a similar sport, is also played in the United States.\nThe current world number 1 is Aly Farag from Egypt.\n\n==Playing equipment==\n[[File:Nanoldsquash2.JPG|right|thumb|Old and new style squash rackets]]\nSquash rackets have maximum dimensions of 686&nbsp;mm (27.0&nbsp;in) long and 215&nbsp;mm (8.5&nbsp;in) wide, with a maximum strung area of 500 square centimeters (77.5&nbsp;sq&nbsp;in). The permitted maximum weight is {{convert|255|g}}, but most have a weight between 90 and 150&nbsp;grams (3\u20135.3&nbsp;oz.).\n\n[[File:Squash Ball Dunlop Revelation Pro 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A squash ball]]\nSquash balls are between 39.5 and 40.5&nbsp;mm in diameter, and weigh 23 to 25&nbsp;grams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squashplayer.co.uk/squash_balls.htm |title=Squash Balls |publisher=Squashplayer.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> They are made with two pieces of rubber compound, glued together to form a hollow sphere and buffed to a matte finish. Different balls are provided for varying temperature and atmospheric conditions and standards of play: more experienced players use slow balls that have less bounce than those used by less experienced players (slower balls tend to \"die\" in court corners, rather than \"standing up\" to allow easier shots). Squash balls must be hit dozens of times to warm them up at the beginning of a session; cold squash balls have very little bounce. Small colored dots on the ball indicate its dynamic level (bounciness). \nThe \"double-yellow dot\" ball, introduced in 2000, is the competition standard, replacing the earlier \"yellow-dot\" ball. There is also an \"orange dot\" ball for use at high altitudes. The recognized colors are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Colour !! Speed (of Play) !! Bounce !! Player Level\n|-\n| Double yellow || Extra Slow || Very low || Experienced\n|-\n| Yellow ||  Slow || Low || Advanced\n|-\n| Red || Medium || High || Medium\n|-\n| Blue || Fast || Very high || Beginner/Junior\n|}\n\nSome ball manufacturers such as Dunlop use a different method of grading balls based on experience. They still have the equivalent dot rating, but are named to help choose a ball that is appropriate for one's skill level. The four different ball types are Intro (Blue dot, 140% of Pro bounce), Progress (Red dot, 120% of Pro bounce), Competition (single yellow dot, 110% of Pro bounce) and Pro (double yellow dot).\n\nMany squash venues mandate the use of shoes with non marking tread and eye protection. Some associations require that all juniors and doubles players must wear eye protection. The [[National Institutes of Health]] recommends wearing goggles with polycarbonate lenses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nei.nih.gov/sports/findingprotection.asp |title=Sports, For Parents, Teachers and Coaches, National Eye Institute [NEI&#93; |publisher=Nei.nih.gov |accessdate=2013-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427122830/http://www.nei.nih.gov/sports/findingprotection.asp |archive-date=2013-04-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===The court===\n[[File:Squash Court.svg|thumb]]\nThe squash court is a playing surface surrounded by four walls. The court surface contains a front line separating the front and back of the court and a half court line, separating the left and right sides of the back portion of the court, creating three 'boxes': the front half, the back left quarter and the back right quarter. Both the back two boxes contain smaller service boxes.\n\nThe court's four walls are divided into a front wall, two side walls, and a back wall. An 'out line' runs along the top of the front wall, descending along the side walls to the back wall. The bottom line of the front wall marks the top of the 'tin', a half meter-high metal area. The middle line of the front wall is the service line. The dimensions of the court are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asbsquash.com/faq/squash-court-construction/|title=Squash Court Construction: \"How to build a Court?\" - ASB SquashCourt|website=asbsquash.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-25}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This player starts the first rally by electing to serve from either the left or right service box. For a legal serve, one of the server's feet must be in the service box, not touching any part of the service box lines, as the player strikes the ball. After being struck by the racket, the ball must strike the front wall above the service line and below the out line and land in the opposite back quarter court. The receiving player can choose to [[Squash (sport)#Types of shots played|volley]] a serve after it has hit the front wall. If the server wins the point, the two players switch sides for the following point. If the server loses the point, the opponent then serves, and can serve from either box.\n\n===Play===\nAfter the serve, the players take turns hitting the ball against the front wall, above the tin and below the out line. The ball may strike the side or back walls at any time, as long as it hits below the out line. It must not hit the floor after hitting the racket and before hitting the front wall. A ball landing on either the out line or the line along the top of the tin is considered to be out. After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to bounce once on the floor (and any number of times against the side or back walls) before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player's movements is forbidden and could result in a let or a stroke. Players typically return to the centre of the court after making a shot.\n\n===Scoring system===\nGames are played according to point-a-rally scoring (PARS) to 11 points. PARS is almost universally preferred by the game's top professionals, and is the current official scoring system for all levels of professional squash tournaments. In PARS, the winner of a rally receives a point, regardless of whether they were the server or returner. Games are played to 11 and must be won by two points. That is, if the score reaches 10\u201310, play continues until one player wins by two points. Competition matches are usually played to \"best-of-five\" games (i.e. the first player to win three games).\n\nSquash can also be played with different scoring systems such as PARS to 15, traditional English or Hand-In-Hand-Out (HiHo) scoring to 9, or RAM scoring (see below). Players often experience PARS and Hi-Ho as requiring different tactics and player attributes.\n\n=== Other scoring systems ===\n\n====PARS to 15====\nPoint-a-rally scoring to 15 was used for the [[World Squash Championships|World Championships]] between 1989 and 2003. PARS to 15, with the tiebreak being two clear points (as per standard PARS) from 14-14, was used in many amateur leagues because PARS to 11 was considered too short.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kent-squash.co.uk/par-scoring-less-squash/|title=PAR scoring equals less squash}}</ref> This system fell out of favor in 2004 when the [[Professional Squash Association]] (PSA) decided to switch to PARS to 11. Games were considered to last too long and the winner would usually be the fitter player, not necessarily the better player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://squashclub.org/main/e-lessons/lessons/intermediate_lessons/faq/faq.shtml|title=Frequently asked questions on squash - general squash tips|website=squashclub.org}}</ref>\n\n====English or HiHo to 9 Scoring====\nKnown as English or hand-in-hand-out scoring, under this system, if the server wins a rally, they receive a point, while if the returner wins rally, only the service changes (i.e.,\nthe ball goes \"hand-out\") and no point is given. The first player to reach nine points wins the game. However, if the score reaches 8\u20138, the player who was first to reach eight decides whether the game will be played to nine, as before (called \"set one\"), or to 10 (called \"set two\"). This scoring system was formerly preferred in Britain, and also among countries with traditional British ties, such as Australia, Canada, Pakistan, South Africa, India and Sri Lanka.\n\n====RAM Scoring====\nThe RAM scoring system is a new scoring system created by former World Champion, [[Ramy Ashour]] and co-founded by Osama Khalifa. This consists of playing a best of five games. Each game is three minutes long; however, this only refers to the three minutes in play. The 'downtime' in between the end of a rally and a serve is not counted. Once the time is up, the clock stops, and the leading player needs to win a final point. If the player who is behind wins the point the game continues until the trailing player catches up and wins one more point than the initially leading player.\n\nFor example, Player one is leading 5-3 and the clock stops. Player two wins the next two points and the score is 5-5. Whoever wins the next point wins the game. This is called sudden death. If the score is 0-0 when the clock stops the clock is reset and the game restarts. For Let Calls the clock reverts to the start time of that point. Further rules include that there must be a referee and a time keeper to make this match official. Players have two minutes of rest between games, and all other standard PSA and WSF rules apply.<ref>http://ramscoring.com/ram-scoring-system.html</ref>\n\n===Transition from English/Hand-In-Hand-Out to PARS 11 scoring===\nIn 2004, the [[Professional Squash Association]] (PSA) decided to switch to PARS to 11. This decision was ratified in 2009 when the [[World Squash Federation]] confirmed the switch to the PARS 11 scoring system.<ref>https://www.theworldgames.org/news/The-World-Games-17/squash--new-scoring-system-438</ref> Since that time, almost all professional and league games have been played according to PARS to 11. One of the reasons for switching to PARS was that long, taxing matches became less frequent and promoters could more easily predict match and session length. [[Gawain Briars]], who served as the Executive Director of the Professional Squash Association when the body decided to switch to PARS in 2004 hoped that PARS would make the \"professional game more exciting to watch, [and] then more people will become involved in the game and our chances of Olympic entry may be enhanced.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.squashplayer.co.uk/superseries/superseries_org/newscoring.htm|title=New Scoring System|website=www.squashplayer.co.uk|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref> [[File:Squash Tournament of Champions 2019, Grand Central Station, NYC.jpg|thumb|[[Tournament of Champions (squash)|Tournament of Champions]] 2019, Grand Central Station, NYC]]\nOne of the problems with English or Hi-Ho scoring is that games often last longer as players continually win service before losing service to the other player without the score being affected. Consequently, the winner is more often than not the fitter athlete. Moreover, English or Hi-Ho scoring can encourage players to play defensively with the aim of wearing down one's opponent before winning by virtue of one's fitness. Such exhausting, defensive play can affect player's prospects in knock-out tournaments and does not make for riveting TV. In English or Hi-Ho, one player might win by 9-0 despite the opponent having repeatedly won service, but without converting that service into actual points.\n\nFor the World Championships: HiHo to 9 was used until 1988; PARS to 15 from 1989 to 2003; and PARS to 11 from 2004. For the British Open: HiHo to 9 was used until 1994; PARS to 15 from 1995 to 2003; and PARS to 11 from 2004.<ref>http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/data-science/squash-scoring.html</ref>\n\nThe WSF's decision to switch to PARS 11 proved controversial in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth where games were usually played according to English or Hi-Ho. When the Veterans Squash Rackets Club of Great Britain surveyed their members in 2012, they found that 80% of their members were against switching from HiHo to PARS.<ref name=\"Gilmour\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/squash/9327497/Squash-scoring-changes-will-kill-essence-of-the-game-say-top-British-veterans.html|title=Squash scoring changes will 'kill essence of the game', say top British veterans|last=Gilmour|first=Rod|date=2012-06-13|access-date=2019-01-04|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> President Philip Ayton argued that PARS would \"kill the essence of the game.\"<ref name=\"Gilmour\"/> Ayton was particularly concerned that the \"great comebacks\" that characterised English or Hi-Ho when \"the player who is down in a game can still attack when in hand serving\"<ref name=\"Gilmour\"/> would disappear as PARS fostered an \"ultra-defensive attitude, because every rally counts the same.\"<ref name=\"Gilmour\"/> [[Jahangir Khan]] has countered that PARS actually made the game far more attacking, but diminished the psychological aspect of the game: \"With the nine points scoring system, matches were more mental and physical and could go longer, but now with the 11-point system, every rally counts, and even if you go behind you can still recover. That makes it a lot more attacking.\" Maj Madan, one the game's top referees, similarly stated that PARS had \"destroyed the fitness element and, more importantly, the cerebral magic of the\u2026game.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://squashmagazine.ussquash.com/2011/08/wills-world-the-referees-call/|title=Will\u2019s World The Referees\u2019 Call {{!}} Squash Magazine|website=squashmagazine.ussquash.com|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref> His comments were unearthed when an email chain of referees discussing the problem of shorter and shorter squash matches was leaked in 2011.\n[[File:Squash Played at the Pyramids of Egypt.jpg|thumb|Squash Played at the Pyramids of Egypt]]\n\n===Strategy and tactics===\nA key strategy in squash is known as \"dominating the T\" (the intersection of the red lines near the centre of the court, shaped like the letter \"T\", where the player is in the best position to retrieve the opponent's next shot). Skilled players will return a shot, and then move back toward the \"T\" before playing the next shot. From this position, the player can quickly access any part of the court to retrieve the opponent's next shot with a minimum of movement and possibly maximising the movement required by the opponent to answer the returned shot.\n\nA common tactic is to hit the ball straight up the side walls to the back corners; this is the basic squash shot, referred to as a \"rail,\" straight drive, wall, or \"length\". After hitting this shot, the player will then move to the centre of the court near the \"T\" to be well placed to retrieve the opponent's return. Attacking with soft or \"short\" shots to the front corners (referred to as \"drop shots\") causes the opponent to cover more of the court and may result in an outright winner.  Boasts or angle shots are deliberately struck off one of the side walls before the ball reaches the front. They are used for deception and again to cause the opponent to cover more of the court. Rear wall shots float to the front either straight or diagonally drawing the opponent to the front. Advantageous tactical shots are available in response to a weak return by the opponent if stretched, the majority of the court being free to the striker.\n\nRallies between experienced players may involve 30 or more shots and therefore a very high premium is placed on fitness, both aerobic and anaerobic. As players become more skilled and, in particular, better able to retrieve shots, points often become a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. At higher levels of the game, the fitter player has a major advantage.\n\nThe ability to change the direction of the ball at the last instant is also a tactic used to unbalance the opponent. Expert players can anticipate the opponent's shot a few tenths of a second before the average player, giving them a chance to react sooner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/visual-acuity-and-reaction-times |title=Agility Training: Improving Sporting Reaction Times |publisher=Pponline.co.uk |accessdate=2013-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505222112/http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/visual-acuity-and-reaction-times |archive-date=2013-05-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>[[File:US Open Squash Championship 2011 Drexel University.jpg|thumb|The glass show court used at the 2011 US Open Squash Championships hosted by Drexel University at the [[Daskalakis Athletic Center]].<br /> 2 points during the Semi Final between [[James Willstrop]] and [[Nick Matthew]] in 2011  :<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgw68AaGWhQ |title=Squash : Nick Matthew v James Wilstrop : 2011 Delaware Investments U.S. Squash Open |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2013-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uKoYDCcyy0 |title=Squash : Nick Matthew v James Wilstrop : 2011 Delaware Investments U.S. Open Squash |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18}}</ref>]]\n\nDepending on the style of play, it is common to refer to squash players<ref>Strategies, Jonathon Power Exposed DVD 2.</ref><ref>Commentary by Jonathon Power and Martin Heath, TOC, 2005</ref> as\n\n* Power players: powerful shots to take time away from their opponent.

For example, [[Peter Nicol]], [[Gr\u00e9gory Gaultier]], [[Nicol David]], [[Mohamed El Shorbagy]].\n* Attritional players: a consistently high-paced game both from shot speed and running speed to wear their opponent down over time. For example, [[David Palmer (squash player)|David Palmer]], [[Nick Matthew]], [[Jansher Khan]], [[Jahangir Khan]].\n\n===Interference and obstruction===\nInterference and obstruction are an inevitable aspect of squash, since two players are confined within a shared space. Generally, the rules entitle players to a direct straight line access to the ball, room for a reasonable swing and an unobstructed shot to any part of the front wall. When interference occurs, a player may appeal for a \"let\" and the referee (or the players themselves if there is no official) then interprets the extent of the interference. The referee may allow a let and the players then replay the point, or award a \"stroke\" to the appealing player (meaning that he is declared the winner of that point) depending on the degree of interference, whether the interfering player made an adequate effort to avoid interfering, and whether the player interfered with was likely to have hit a winning shot had the interference not occurred. An exception occurs when the interfering player is directly in the path of the other player's swing, effectively preventing the swing, in which case a stroke is always awarded.\n\nWhen it is deemed that there has been little or no interference, the rules provide that no let is to be allowed in the interests of continuity of play and the discouraging of spurious appeals for lets. Because of the subjectivity in interpreting the nature and magnitude of interference, awarding (or withholding) of lets and strokes is often controversial.\n\n[[File:Open International de Squash de Nantes 2017.jpg|thumb|A glasscourt, under Naves, in [[Open International de Squash de Nantes|Nantes]] in France]]\n\nInterference also occurs when a player's shot hits their opponent prior to hitting the front wall. If the ball was travelling towards the side wall when it hit the opponent, or if it had already hit the side wall and was travelling directly to the front wall, it is usually a let. However, it is a stroke to the player who hit the ball if the ball was travelling straight to the front wall when the ball hit the opponent, without having first hit the side wall. Generally after a player has been hit by the ball, both players stand still; if the struck player is standing directly in front of the player who hit the ball he loses the stroke; if he is not straight in front, a let is played. If it is deemed that the player who is striking the ball is deliberately trying to hit his opponent, they will lose the stroke. An exception occurs when the player hitting the ball has \"turned\", i.e., letting the ball pass them on one side, but then hitting it on the other side as it came off the back wall. In these cases, the stroke goes to the player who was hit by the ball.\n\n===Referee===\nThe referee is usually a certified position issued by the club or assigned squash league. Any conflict or interference is dealt with by the referee. The referee may also take away points or games due to improper etiquette regarding conduct or rules. The referee is also usually responsible for the scoring of games. Three referees are usually used in professional tournaments. The Central referee has responsibility to call the score and make decisions with the two side referees.\n\n==Contribution to health==\nSquash provides an excellent cardiovascular workout. Players can expend approximately 600 to 1,000 food [[calorie]]s (3,000 to 4,000 [[kilojoule|kJ]]) every hour playing squash according to English or Hi-Ho scoring.<ref name=\"santelmann2003\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/2003/09/30/cx_ns_1001featslide.html?thisSpeed=20000 |title=Santelmann, N. 2003.

Judith's maid Abra stands beside her mistress to the right as Judith extends her arm to hold a blade  against Holofernes's neck; lying on his stomach, neck contorted as he turns his head towards his assassin, he is vulnerable. X-rays have revealed that Caravaggio adjusted the placement of Holofernes' head as he proceeded, separating it slightly from the torso and moving it minutely to the right. The faces of the three characters demonstrate the artist's mastery of emotion, Judith's countenance in particular showing a mix of determination and repulsion.

He was the elder brother of Wales rugby legend [[Gwyn Nicholls]], and his son [[Jack Nicholls (footballer)|Jack Nicholls]] was a Welsh international footballer.\n\n==Life history==\nNicholls was born in 1868 in [[Hartpury]], England to Hartley Nicholls, a farm supervisor, and his wife Jane Eliza (n\u00e9e, Millard).<ref name=\"Parry-Jones14\">Parry-Jones (1999), pg 14.</ref> The second eldest of five children, he had an elder sister and five younger brothers, the third of his brothers being [[Gwyn Nicholls]].

He left Wales for Hull that year, returning in 1910.<ref name=\"Parry-Jones87\">Parry-Jones (1999), pg 87.</ref>\n\nHe was instrumental in the growth of [[Cardiff City F.C.]], and \"Cardiff City was admitted to the Second Division of the Southern League in 1910.

He was influential in critical team decisions in the run up to the cup final and almost removed the Cardiff Captain, Fred Keenor, in the run up to the match. \"Keenor was officially listed at a meeting of club directors at The Corporation pub in Canton on 19 January 1927. At the summit, called by Sid Nicholls, fellow board member Walter Riden \u2013 Keenor's old teacher at Stacey Road Primary School in Adamsdown \u2013 proposed listing the captain. Nicholls seconded the idea and Keenor's future at Ninian was in jeopardy.

By June 1928 Nicholls was the Vice-President F. A. Wales.<ref>Photograph of Meeting of The International Football Association Board, 9 June 1928</ref>\n\nAround 1920, Nicholls had met Katherine Brennan and went on to have a second family with her consisting of five sons and one daughter out of wedlock, scandalous for the time. He lost his money in the stockmarket crash of 1929, bringing up the family in poverty in [[Splott]], Cardiff in the 1930s. He married Katherine Brennan in 1934.<ref>p475. Marriages registered in July August September 1934</ref>\n\n==Rugby career==\nNicholls joined Cardiff while still in his teens and was part of the Second XV during the team's unbeaten 1885\u201386 season.<ref name=\"Parry-Jones26\">Parry-Jones (1999), pg 26.</ref> The following season he was part of the first team and in 1888 he scored 11 tries for the club, a large number for a forward. He later became vice-captain of the first team to [[Charlie Arthur]]'s captaincy.\n\nNicholls was first selected to represent Wales in 1888, in the first match between the country and Southern Hemisphere opposition, the New Zealand Natives. The game was played at [[St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground|St. Helen]]'s, [[Swansea]], in front of a hostile home crowd, unhappy at the lack of [[Swansea RFC|Swansea]] players in the back positions. Nicholls was one of eight new caps in the Welsh team, which included Cardiff teammate [[Norman Biggs]].<ref name=\"Billot17\">Billot (1972), pg 17.</ref> Nicholls was instrumental in setting up the second try for [[Jim Hannan (rugby player)|Jim Hannan]], in a 5\u20130 Welsh win.

Morgan.<ref name=\"Billot21\">Billot (1972), pg 21.</ref>\n\nNicholls was reselected for Wales in the very next international, a match against Scotland as part of the [[1889 Home Nations Championship]]. Under the captaincy of [[Frank Hill (rugby player)|Frank Hill]], Wales were beaten by two tries to nil, though selectors kept faith with Nicholls when he was chosen for the final game of the tournament to Ireland. After another loss, Nicholls found himself out of favour and was replaced by [[William Williams (rugby, born 1866)|William Williams]]. Nicholls played just one more game for Wales in the [[1891 Home Nations Championship|1891 Championship]] as part of [[Willie Thomas]]' team that took on Scotland. The Scottish outplayed Wales scoring seven tries without reply, with the Welsh team hamstrung by an inefficient pair of halves.<ref name=\"Griffiths4:5\">Griffiths (1987), pg 4:5.</ref>\n\nNicholls retired from playing rugby union in 1891, but in 1901, he was lured North to take up professional rugby league. The decision was a shock to his family, but the money for turning professional was good.

Fred is the husband of [[Wilma Flintstone]] and father of [[Pebbles Flintstone]]. His best friend is his next door neighbor, [[Barney Rubble|Barney]], who has a wife named [[Betty Rubble|Betty]] and an adopted son, named [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]].<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=flintstones The Flintstones] ''[[The Museum of Broadcast Communications]]''</ref>\n\nFred lives in the fictional [[prehistoric]] town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], a world where dinosaurs coexist with modernized [[caveman|cavepeople]] and the cavepeople enjoy \"primitive\" versions of [[modern conveniences]] such as [[telephone]]s, [[automobile]]s, and [[washing machine]]s. Fred's trademark catchphrase yell is \"yabba dabba doo!\", a phrase that was originally his club's cheer, and later adopted as part of the theme song from the third season on and used in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action ''Flintstones'' movie]].\n\nSince the original series' run, Fred has appeared in various other cartoon spinoffs, live action adaptations, music videos, and [[television commercial|commercial]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nWhile the mid-1980s [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' depicts Fred as a child, the series may be [[apocryphal]] due to its presenting Wilma as a childhood friend of Fred and Barney; the original series asserts that they first met as young adults.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Still, the series' depictions that Fred is the only child of Ed and Edna Flintstone (a handyman and a [[housewife|homemaker]], respectively) might be taken as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. In the long-running Flintstones newspaper comic strip by [[Gene Hazelton]], Fred's father, '''Pops Flintstone''', was a recurring character.<ref>https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uixhK3mS6Yw/VwQXPSOzfBI/AAAAAAABj9A/ypZWn57gvkk750lJj5CtofFfQyRLU6Uag/s1600/Flintstones-1967-08-26.jpg</ref>\n\nAs young adults, Fred and Barney worked as bellhops at a resort. There, they meet and fall in love with Wilma and Betty, who were working there as [[cigarette girl]]s. Fred and Wilma's mother, [[Pearl Slaghoople]], also met and took an instant dislike to each other, starting a long-lasting rivalry between the two.<ref name=\"bachelor\"/> An unspecified amount of time later, Fred married Wilma.\n\nFred is a typical [[blue-collar worker]], who works as a \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] crane operator\" at Slate Rock and Gravel Company (also known as Rockhead and Quarry Cave Construction Company in earlier episodes). Fred's job title in the second-season episode \"Divided We Sail\" is \"geological engineer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580165/|title=Divided We Sail|via=www.imdb.com|accessdate=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring the original series' third season, Wilma gives birth to the couple's daughter, Pebbles. Years later, when Pebbles is a teenager, Fred and Barney join the Bedrock [[police]] force for a time as part-time [[police officer]]s.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" /> Eventually, Fred becomes a [[grandfather]] to the adult Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's twins, Chip and Roxy. Fred's family grew again in ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'', when he and Wilma adopted an orphaned caveboy named Stony, and despite a rough start, Fred and his new son bonded well.\n\n==Relatives==\nThe Flintstone family's paternal side originally came from the prehistoric state of Arkanstone, where they had been engaged in a feud similar to the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]]. The feud was originally started by an ancestor of Fred's making a joke about a Hatrock family portrait (\"I don't know what the artist got for doing that painting, but he should've gotten life!\"). In the fourth-season episode \"Bedrock Hillbillies,\" the feud is ended when Fred helps rescue Pebbles and a Hatrock baby, only to start up again when Fred makes the same joke as his ancestor. The Hatrocks later appear in the follow-up fifth-season episode \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\", where they visit Bedrock. The last of the Arkanstone Flintstones was Fred's great-great-uncle Zeke Flintstone who lived to 102.\n\nOther relatives of Fred include: Rockbottom \"Rocky/Stony\" Flintstone, Fred's grandfather, who was a veteran of Stone World War One;<ref name=\"raiders\" />; Uncle Giggles Flintstone, a rich, eccentric practical joker whose jokes drive Fred into a mad rage;<ref name=\"haunted\" /> James Hardrock, Edna's father; Uncle Tex Hardrock, Fred's rich Texan uncle;<ref name=\"tex\" /> Tumbleweed and Mary Lou Jim, Fred's rich Texan cousins;<ref name=\"droop\" />  .\n[[File:Jackie Gleason - 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Flintstones'' character was based on the character [[Ralph Kramden]] ([[Jackie Gleason]]) from ''[[The Honeymooners]]'']]\n\n==Personality==\nFred's personality was based on that of [[Ralph Kramden]] of the 1950s television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' and Chester A. Riley from ''[[The Life of Riley]]'', both of whom were originally portrayed on television by [[Jackie Gleason]] (Riley was originally portrayed on radio, film and later television episodes by [[William Bendix]]). Much like Ralph, Fred tends to be loud-mouthed, aggressive, and constantly scheming ways to improve his family's working class lot in life, often with unintended results. Also like Ralph, despite his harshness, he is friendly, and has a loving heart, who is very devoted to his family and cares a lot about his best friend and next door neighbor [[Barney Rubble]]. Fred loses his temper easily and is very impatient, but he seems free of malice and never holds a grudge. Although his loudness irritates the people around him, Fred proves friendly, often going out of his way to help others. Also, although Fred often annoys Wilma with his immaturity, he is known to go to great lengths to please his family and apologize when he goes too far. Other known characters from other programs may also be known to have personalities based on Fred Flintstone including [[Archie Bunker]] from ''[[All In The Family]]'' and ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'' (both played by [[Carroll OConnor]]), [[George Jefferson]] from ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' (played by [[Sherman Hemsley]]), [[Mel Sharples]] from ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' (played by [[Vic Tayback]]) and Frank DeFazio from ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' (played by [[Phil Foster]]).\n\nFred's interests include [[bowling]], playing [[Billiards|pool]], [[golf]], [[poker]] and lounging around the house. Fred has won championships with his bowling skills; in one episode, he goes so far as to take [[ballet]] lessons in order to improve his game.<ref>\"Bowling Ballet,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref> The nickname of \"Twinkletoes\" stuck with him when Fred attended a local university and became eligible to play on their football team, and it became his [[call sign]].<ref>\"Flintstone of Prinstone,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an excellent golfer. Fred is a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos Lodge (named \"the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs\" in an early episode).<ref name=\"hotlips\">\"Hot Lips Hannigan,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> Fred also has a serious [[gambling problem]]; the mere mention of the word \"bet\" causes Fred to stammer \"bet\" over and over again (sounding like a clucking chicken) and go on gambling binges.<ref>\"The Gambler,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an avid driver. In the fifth-season episode \"Indianrockolis 500,\" Fred entered the [[Indianapolis 500|famed prehistoric auto race]] under the [[pseudonym]] \"Goggles Paisano\".<ref>{{YouTube|GmQoWQb4tx0}}</ref>\n\nFred's [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba-Dabba-Doo!\"; [[Alan Reed]], voice actor who provided Fred's voice from 1960\u20131977, reportedly said that the inspiration for the phrase came from his mother, who used to say, \"A little dab'll do ya,\" probably borrowed from a Brylcreem commercial. When the script called for a simple 'Yahoo!' Alan either asked if he could alter the phrase or he ad-libbed. It inspired, in the 1970s a short-lived fruit drink called \"Yabba Dabba Dew\" and may or may not have also inspired [[George Jetson]]'s similar-sounding catchphrase, \"Hooba-dooba-dooba\" (or \"Hooba-Dooba\"). It does, however, become the subject of a song by [[Hoagy Carmichael]] that the singer-songwriter performs in an episode of ''The Flintstones''<ref>. In \"The Hit Song Writers,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred's ability to carry a tune was quite good in his younger years. One early episode<ref name=\"hotlips\" /> sees Fred (with Barney, who is a skilled [[drummer]]) perform at a nightclub with his musician friend \"Hot Lips Hannigan\" where his singing caused teenage girls to swoon over him; on this occasion, he was nicknamed \"the [[Mel Torme|Golden Smog]]\". In another first-season episode, \"Girls' Night Out\", Fred recorded a demo record at a [[carnival]] of the song \"[[Listen to the Mockingbird|Listen to the Rocking Bird]]\", which ended up making him a teenage singing idol named \"Hi Fye.\" As the series progressed, however, his voice became worse and worse (even during his success as a singer, Wilma was never impressed by Fred's voice), eventually to the point that a temporary maid the Flintstones hired quit rather than having to hear Fred sing.<ref>\"Wilma, the Maid,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref>\n\nDue to his impulsive and short-tempered behavior and stubborn and somewhat selfish nature, Fred seems to be accident-prone. Even his most innocent and mundane actions often cause widespread confusion. At the end of the closing credits, Fred begins to knock the door of his house and starts yelling \"Wilma\", to open the door.\n\nAccording to the original series' third-season episode \"The Birthday Party\" (originally aired April 5, 1963), Fred's birthday is February 2. Fred's address has varied through the series' run, with addresses given for the Flintstone residence including 345 Cave Stone Road, and 1313 Cobblestone Way. Fred's address was cited as \"55 Cobblestone Rd\" in the 1961 episode \"The X-Ray Story\".\n\n==Animated media==\n===Television shows===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Series number\n!style=\"width:250px;\"|Title\n!style=\"width:100px;\"|Broadcast run\n!style=\"width:150px;\"|Original channel\n!style=\"width:175px;\"|Total # episodes\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Total # seasons\n|-\n|1\n|''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''\n|1971\u20131972\n|rowspan=\"3\" | [[CBS]]\n|16 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|2\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]''\n|1972\u20131973\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 18 episodes\n|-\n|3\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''{{Efn|A re-titled second season of reruns featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Hour''.}}\n|1973\u20131974\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|4\n|''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]''{{Efn|A 30-minute weekday animated series which aired in first-run syndication.}}\n|1977\u20131978\n|[[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]]\n|95 episodes\n|1\n|-\n|5\n|''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1979\n|rowspan=\"5\" | [[NBC]]\n|17 episodes\n|2\n|-\n|6\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]''\n|13 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|7\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' {{Efn|This 90-minute series featured reruns of ''Fred and Barney Meet the Thing'' combined with episodes of ''The New Shmoo''.}}\n|1979\u20131980\n|17 episodes\n|-\n|8\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''\n|1980\u20131982\n|18 episodes\n|rowspan=\"3\" | 2\n|-\n|9\n|''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]''{{Efn|A compilation series featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Show''.}}\n|1982\u20131984\n|26 episodes\n|-\n|10\n|''[[The Flintstone Kids]]''\n|1986\u20131988\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstone Kids episodes|34 episodes]]\n|-\n|11\n|''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]''\n|1995\n|[[Cartoon Network]]\n|1 episode\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|12\n|''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''\n|2020<!-- Do NOT link this title to \"Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs!

In one Winston ad, Fred and Barney saw the men working hard at the quarry and decided to retire out of sight for a smoke break. After extolling the virtues of the Winston brand cigarette, Fred lit up his cigarette and delivered the catch phrase: \"[[Winston tastes good like a cigarette should]]\".

Fred is the husband of [[Wilma Flintstone]] and father of [[Pebbles Flintstone]]. His best friend is his next door neighbor, [[Barney Rubble|Barney]], who has a wife named [[Betty Rubble|Betty]] and an adopted son, named [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]].<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=flintstones The Flintstones] ''[[The Museum of Broadcast Communications]]''</ref>\n\nFred lives in the fictional [[prehistoric]] town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], a world where dinosaurs coexist with modernized [[caveman|cavepeople]] and the cavepeople enjoy \"primitive\" versions of [[modern conveniences]] such as [[telephone]]s, [[automobile]]s, and [[washing machine]]s. Fred's trademark catchphrase yell is \"yabba dabba doo!\", a phrase that was originally his club's cheer, and later adopted as part of the theme song from the third season on and used in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action ''Flintstones'' movie]].\n\nSince the original series' run, Fred has appeared in various other cartoon spinoffs, live action adaptations, music videos, and [[television commercial|commercial]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nWhile the mid-1980s [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' depicts Fred as a child, the series may be [[apocryphal]] due to its presenting Wilma as a childhood friend of Fred and Barney; the original series asserts that they first met as young adults.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Still, the series' depictions that Fred is the only child of Ed and Edna Flintstone (a handyman and a [[housewife|homemaker]], respectively) might be taken as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. In the long-running Flintstones newspaper comic strip by [[Gene Hazelton]], Fred's father, '''Pops Flintstone''', was a recurring character.<ref>https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uixhK3mS6Yw/VwQXPSOzfBI/AAAAAAABj9A/ypZWn57gvkk750lJj5CtofFfQyRLU6Uag/s1600/Flintstones-1967-08-26.jpg</ref>\n\nAs young adults, Fred and Barney worked as bellhops at a resort. There, they meet and fall in love with Wilma and Betty, who were working there as [[cigarette girl]]s. Fred and Wilma's mother, [[Pearl Slaghoople]], also met and took an instant dislike to each other, starting a long-lasting rivalry between the two.<ref name=\"bachelor\"/> An unspecified amount of time later, Fred married Wilma.\n\nFred is a typical [[blue-collar worker]], who works as a \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] crane operator\" at Slate Rock and Gravel Company (also known as Rockhead and Quarry Cave Construction Company in earlier episodes). Fred's job title in the second-season episode \"Divided We Sail\" is \"geological engineer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580165/|title=Divided We Sail|via=www.imdb.com|accessdate=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring the original series' third season, Wilma gives birth to the couple's daughter, Pebbles. Years later, when Pebbles is a teenager, Fred and Barney join the Bedrock [[police]] force for a time as part-time [[police officer]]s.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" /> Eventually, Fred becomes a [[grandfather]] to the adult Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's twins, Chip and Roxy. Fred's family grew again in ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'', when he and Wilma adopted an orphaned caveboy named Stony, and despite a rough start, Fred and his new son bonded well.\n\n==Relatives==\nThe Flintstone family's paternal side originally came from the prehistoric state of Arkanstone, where they had been engaged in a feud similar to the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]]. The feud was originally started by an ancestor of Fred's making a joke about a Hatrock family portrait (\"I don't know what the artist got for doing that painting, but he should've gotten life!\"). In the fourth-season episode \"Bedrock Hillbillies,\" the feud is ended when Fred helps rescue Pebbles and a Hatrock baby, only to start up again when Fred makes the same joke as his ancestor. The Hatrocks later appear in the follow-up fifth-season episode \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\", where they visit Bedrock. The last of the Arkanstone Flintstones was Fred's great-great-uncle Zeke Flintstone who lived to 102.\n\nOther relatives of Fred include: Rockbottom \"Rocky/Stony\" Flintstone, Fred's grandfather, who was a veteran of Stone World War One;<ref name=\"raiders\" />; Uncle Giggles Flintstone, a rich, eccentric practical joker whose jokes drive Fred into a mad rage;<ref name=\"haunted\" /> James Hardrock, Edna's father; Uncle Tex Hardrock, Fred's rich Texan uncle;<ref name=\"tex\" /> Tumbleweed and Mary Lou Jim, Fred's rich Texan cousins;<ref name=\"droop\" />  .\n[[File:Jackie Gleason - 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Flintstones'' character was based on the character [[Ralph Kramden]] ([[Jackie Gleason]]) from ''[[The Honeymooners]]'']]\n\n==Personality==\nFred's personality was based on that of [[Ralph Kramden]] of the 1950s television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' and Chester A. Riley from ''[[The Life of Riley]]'', both of whom were originally portrayed on television by [[Jackie Gleason]] (Riley was originally portrayed on radio, film and later television episodes by [[William Bendix]]). Much like Ralph, Fred tends to be loud-mouthed, aggressive, and constantly scheming ways to improve his family's working class lot in life, often with unintended results. Also like Ralph, despite his harshness, he is friendly, and has a loving heart, who is very devoted to his family and cares a lot about his best friend and next door neighbor [[Barney Rubble]]. Fred loses his temper easily and is very impatient, but he seems free of malice and never holds a grudge. Although his loudness irritates the people around him, Fred proves friendly, often going out of his way to help others. Also, although Fred often annoys Wilma with his immaturity, he is known to go to great lengths to please his family and apologize when he goes too far. Other known characters from other programs may also be known to have personalities based on Fred Flintstone including [[Archie Bunker]] from ''[[All In The Family]]'' and ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'' (both played by [[Carroll OConnor]]), [[George Jefferson]] from ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' (played by [[Sherman Hemsley]]), [[Mel Sharples]] from ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' (played by [[Vic Tayback]]) and Frank DeFazio from ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' (played by [[Phil Foster]]).\n\nFred's interests include [[bowling]], playing [[Billiards|pool]], [[golf]], [[poker]] and lounging around the house. Fred has won championships with his bowling skills; in one episode, he goes so far as to take [[ballet]] lessons in order to improve his game.<ref>\"Bowling Ballet,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref> The nickname of \"Twinkletoes\" stuck with him when Fred attended a local university and became eligible to play on their football team, and it became his [[call sign]].<ref>\"Flintstone of Prinstone,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an excellent golfer. Fred is a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos Lodge (named \"the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs\" in an early episode).<ref name=\"hotlips\">\"Hot Lips Hannigan,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> Fred also has a serious [[gambling problem]]; the mere mention of the word \"bet\" causes Fred to stammer \"bet\" over and over again (sounding like a clucking chicken) and go on gambling binges.<ref>\"The Gambler,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an avid driver. In the fifth-season episode \"Indianrockolis 500,\" Fred entered the [[Indianapolis 500|famed prehistoric auto race]] under the [[pseudonym]] \"Goggles Paisano\".<ref>{{YouTube|GmQoWQb4tx0}}</ref>\n\nFred's [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba-Dabba-Doo!\"; [[Alan Reed]], voice actor who provided Fred's voice from 1960\u20131977, reportedly said that the inspiration for the phrase came from his mother, who used to say, \"A little dab'll do ya,\" probably borrowed from a Brylcreem commercial. When the script called for a simple 'Yahoo!' Alan either asked if he could alter the phrase or he ad-libbed. It inspired, in the 1970s a short-lived fruit drink called \"Yabba Dabba Dew\" and may or may not have also inspired [[George Jetson]]'s similar-sounding catchphrase, \"Hooba-dooba-dooba\" (or \"Hooba-Dooba\"). It does, however, become the subject of a song by [[Hoagy Carmichael]] that the singer-songwriter performs in an episode of ''The Flintstones''<ref>. In \"The Hit Song Writers,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred's ability to carry a tune was quite good in his younger years. One early episode<ref name=\"hotlips\" /> sees Fred (with Barney, who is a skilled [[drummer]]) perform at a nightclub with his musician friend \"Hot Lips Hannigan\" where his singing caused teenage girls to swoon over him; on this occasion, he was nicknamed \"the [[Mel Torme|Golden Smog]]\". In another first-season episode, \"Girls' Night Out\", Fred recorded a demo record at a [[carnival]] of the song \"[[Listen to the Mockingbird|Listen to the Rocking Bird]]\", which ended up making him a teenage singing idol named \"Hi Fye.\" As the series progressed, however, his voice became worse and worse (even during his success as a singer, Wilma was never impressed by Fred's voice), eventually to the point that a temporary maid the Flintstones hired quit rather than having to hear Fred sing.<ref>\"Wilma, the Maid,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref>\n\nDue to his impulsive and short-tempered behavior and stubborn and somewhat selfish nature, Fred seems to be accident-prone. Even his most innocent and mundane actions often cause widespread confusion. At the end of the closing credits, Fred begins to knock the door of his house and starts yelling \"Wilma\", to open the door.\n\nAccording to the original series' third-season episode \"The Birthday Party\" (originally aired April 5, 1963), Fred's birthday is February 2. Fred's address has varied through the series' run, with addresses given for the Flintstone residence including 345 Cave Stone Road, and 1313 Cobblestone Way. Fred's address was cited as \"55 Cobblestone Rd\" in the 1961 episode \"The X-Ray Story\".\n\n==Animated media==\n===Television shows===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Series number\n!style=\"width:250px;\"|Title\n!style=\"width:100px;\"|Broadcast run\n!style=\"width:150px;\"|Original channel\n!style=\"width:175px;\"|Total # episodes\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Total # seasons\n|-\n|1\n|''[[The Flintstones]]''\n|1960\u20131966\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstones episodes|166 episodes]]\n|6\n|-\n|2\n|''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''\n|1971\u20131972\n|rowspan=\"3\" | [[CBS]]\n|16 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|3\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]''\n|1972\u20131973\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 18 episodes\n|-\n|4\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''{{Efn|A re-titled second season of reruns featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Hour''.}}\n|1973\u20131974\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|5\n|''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]''{{Efn|A 30-minute weekday animated series which aired in first-run syndication.}}\n|1977\u20131978\n|[[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]]\n|95 episodes\n|1\n|-\n|6\n|''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1979\n|rowspan=\"5\" | [[NBC]]\n|17 episodes\n|2\n|-\n|7\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]''\n|13 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|8\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' {{Efn|This 90-minute series featured reruns of ''Fred and Barney Meet the Thing'' combined with episodes of ''The New Shmoo''.}}\n|1979\u20131980\n|17 episodes\n|-\n|9\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''\n|1980\u20131982\n|18 episodes\n|rowspan=\"3\" | 2\n|-\n|10\n|''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]''{{Efn|A compilation series featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Show''.}}\n|1982\u20131984\n|26 episodes\n|-\n|11\n|''[[The Flintstone Kids]]''\n|1986\u20131988\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstone Kids episodes|34 episodes]]\n|-\n|12\n|''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''\n|2020<!-- Do NOT link this title to \"Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs!

The series and several episode scripts were adapted from the \"Dobie Gillis\" short stories written by [[Max Shulman]] since 1945, and first collected in 1951 under the same title as the subsequent TV series. Shulman also wrote a feature film adaptation of his \"Dobie Gillis\" stories for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1953, entitled ''[[The Affairs of Dobie Gillis]]'' which featured [[Bobby Van]] in the title role.\n\n''Dobie Gillis'' is significant as the first American television program produced for a major network to feature teenagers as leading characters. In other series, such as ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' and ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', teenagers were portrayed as supporting characters in a family story. An even earlier 1954 series, ''[[Meet Corliss Archer (TV series)|Meet Corliss Archer]]'', featured teenagers in leading roles and aired in syndication.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> ''Dobie Gillis'' broke ground by depicting elements of the current  [[counterculture]], particularly the [[Beat Generation]], primarily embodied in a stereotypical version of the \"beatnik\".{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Series star [[Dwayne Hickman]] would later say that ''Dobie'' represented \u201cthe end of innocence of the 1950s before the oncoming 1960s revolution\u201d.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\n==Overview==\n===Dobie Gillis and Maynard G. Krebs===\n[[File:Dobie gillis 1960.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman, left), [[Maynard G. Krebs]] (Bob Denver, right) and one of Dobie's \"many loves\", Yvette LeBlanc ([[Danielle De Metz]]), in a still from the ''Dobie Gillis'' episode \"Parlez-Vous English\", originally aired December 27, 1960]]\nThe series revolved around teenager Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman), who aspired to have popularity, money, and the attention of beautiful and unattainable girls. He did not have any of these qualities in abundance, and the tiny crises surrounding Dobie's lack of success made the story in each weekly episode. Also constantly in question, by Dobie and others, was Dobie's future, as the boy proved to be a poor student and an aimless drifter.\n\nHis sidekick and de facto best friend was American television's first [[beatnik]], [[Maynard G. Krebs]] ([[Bob Denver]]), who became the series' [[breakout character]]. An enthusiastic fan of [[jazz music]] (with a strong distaste for the music of [[Lawrence Welk]]), Maynard plays the [[bongo drum|bongos]], collects tinfoil and petrified frogs, and steers clear of romance, authority figures, and work (yelping \"Work?!\" every time he hears the word). Always speaking with the vernacular and slang of the beatniks and jazz musicians he admired, Maynard punctuates his sentences with the word \"[[Like (discourse particle)|like]]\" and has a tendency towards [[malapropism]]s. The main running gag on ''Dobie Gillis'' would have Dobie or one of the other characters rattling off a series of adjectives describing something undesirable or disgusting (\"I'd be a ragged, useless, dirty wreck!\"), at which point a previously unseen Maynard would appear (entering the scene in close-up), saying \"You rang?\"\n\n''Dobie Gillis'' is set in Central City, a fictitious city in the [[Midwestern United States]] (the original short stories are explicitly set in the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] area). One of the show's running gags is the reference, especially by Maynard, to a movie called ''The Monster that Devoured Cleveland'' and its sequels, one of which always seems to be playing at the local cinema.\n\n===Supporting characters===\nDobie's often apoplectic father, Herbert T. Gillis ([[Frank Faylen]]), owned a grocery store and was only happy when Dobie was behind a broom. Dobie's mother, Winifred ([[Florida Friebus]]), was a usually calm and serene woman who protected Dobie to the best of her ability and tended to baby him. Herbert Gillis, a proud, hard-working child of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] veteran, was often (during the first season of the show) heard to declare, in relation to Dobie, \"I gotta kill that boy, I just gotta!\" The Gillis family also originally included an older son, Davey Gillis (portrayed by Dwayne Hickman's own older brother, [[Darryl Hickman]]), who made three appearances during the first season while home on break from college before being written out of the show.<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nDobie's two main [[antagonist]]s were rich kids Milton Armitage (played by [[Warren Beatty]]), who appeared in five episodes, and, after Beatty's departure, Chatsworth Osborne Jr., Milton's cousin (played by [[Steve Franken]]). Both characters represented the wealth and popularity to which Dobie aspired, but also served as romantic and competitive rivals for Dobie. Beatty's Milton was taller, better looking, and more athletic than Chatsworth. [[Doris Packer]] played Clarissa Osborne, Chatsworth's overbearing and snobbish mother.\n\nDobie was hopelessly attracted to the beautiful but greedy blonde [[Thalia Menninger]] ([[Tuesday Weld]]). Thalia was written out of the series after the first season and was succeeded by a seemingly endless stream of women for whom Dobie hankered. Weld returned as a slightly wiser Thalia for two guest appearances in season 3 and 4.\n\n[[Zelda Gilroy]] ([[Sheila Kuehl|Sheila James]]) was a brilliant and eager young girl, hopelessly in love with Dobie, much to his annoyance. Zelda did not find Dobie particularly attractive, but fell in love with him because she found him helpless and needing of her care, and also because of the concept of \"[[propinquity]]\" (or nearness; as Gillis and Gilroy, they were typically [[Alphabetical order#Ordering by surname|seated together]] in class).<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Despite his protests, Dobie was clearly fond of Zelda, and Zelda claimed Dobie loved her but just had not realized it yet. To prove this, she would wrinkle her nose at Dobie, who would reflexively do the same back to Zelda and then protest \"now cut that out!\" Dobie and Zelda would later appear as a middle-aged married couple in the two spin-off ''Dobie Gillis'' reunion projects of the 1970s/1980s.\n\nLeander Pomfritt ([[Herbert Anderson]] in the pilot, [[William Schallert]] thereafter) was Dobie's English and science teacher at Central High School and later, when Dobie went to S. Peter Pryor Junior College, Pomfritt (played by Schallert) was on the faculty there as well. A stern educator fond of [[deadpan]] quips, Pomfritt referred to his pupils as \"my young barbarians\" and served as a father figure to both Dobie and Maynard.\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Bob Denver Dobie Gillis 1961.jpg|thumb|Maynard was not prepared to give up his beard after entering the army. Bob Denver and Kay Elhardt are featured in this still from the ''Dobie Gillis'' episode \"The Ballad of Maynard's Beard\", originally aired April 18, 1961.]]\nMost of the action for the first season-and-a-half of ''Dobie Gillis'' centered on the Gillis grocery store, Central High School, and the Central City park. The park scenes are used as the show's [[Frame story|framing device]], with Dobie sitting on a park bench in front of a reproduction of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s statue ''[[The Thinker]]''. Breaking the [[fourth wall]], he would explain to the viewing audience his problem of the week, usually girls or money (in the earliest episodes, Dobie is seen emulating the trademark pose of ''The Thinker'' \u2013 head planted on fist in deep contemplation \u2013 before turning and acknowledging the camera).<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nThe teen characters graduated from high school halfway through the second season, and Dobie and Maynard (along with Chatsworth) subsequently did a brief stint in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> Dobie continued to break the fourth wall and narrate the episodes, with the park set eschewed for an abstract set with the same reproduction of \"The Thinker.\"\n\nAt the start of the third season, Dobie and Maynard received their Army discharges and they, Zelda, and Chatsworth enroll in S. Peter Pryor [[junior college|Junior College]], where Mr. Pomfritt was now a professor after having resigned from his position at Central High. Dobie's science and history teacher at the college was Dr. Imogene Burkhart ([[Jean Byron]], whose real name was used for that of the character). In season four, Dobie's teenaged cousin Duncan \"Dunky\" Gillis ([[Bobby Diamond]]) moves in with the Gillises, and becomes something of a tag-along for Dobie and Maynard. The fourth-season episodes tended more towards surreal plots and situations featuring Maynard as the central character rather than Dobie.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |p=56}}\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Dwayne Hickman]], as Dobie Gillis, is a clean-cut teenager (later young adult), an unremarkable student whose young heart finds poetry and literature resonant. He aspires to have dates with all of the beautiful girls he pursues, despite the pressures of home life, high school, and later the military and college. Dobie also serves as the series narrator, relating his observations to the audience from in front of a statue of Rodin's ''The Thinker''.\n*[[Frank Faylen]], as Herbert T. Gillis, is Dobie's old-fashioned, short-tempered, and gruff father, who runs a small independent grocery store.\n*[[Florida Friebus]], as Winifred \"Winnie\" Gillis, is Dobie's doting mother, who tends to baby her son and critique her husband's parenting skills.\n*[[Bob Denver]], as [[Maynard G. Krebs]], is Dobie's lazy and somewhat goofy best friend, a would-be beatnik who shuns romance, authority figures, and work. Like Dobie does later, Maynard briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.\n\n===Semiregulars===\n*[[Tuesday Weld]], as Thalia Menninger (season 1), is a beautiful high school classmate of Dobie's who is only willing to date Dobie when he has money or helps her in her schemes to make some for herself (with a father in poor health and a sister who married a layabout, Thalia sees it as her duty to bring some money into the family; she acknowledges that were this not a factor, she would date Dobie).<ref>The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, episode 1- 'Caper at the Bijou'</ref> Weld departed the series after the first season, later returning to make two guest appearances, as a somewhat chastened Thalia, once in season 3 and once in season 4.\n*[[Warren Beatty]], as Milton Armitage (season 1), is a rich jock at Dobie's high school and a rival of Dobie for Thalia's affections. Beatty quit the series midway through the first season.\n*[[Sheila Kuehl|Sheila James]], as [[Zelda Gilroy]], is the smartest girl in Dobie's high school and college, who is in love with the uninterested Dobie and schemes ways to get him to date and marry her.\n*[[Steve Franken]], as [[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]], is a spoiled rich boy and a classmate of Dobie's in high school and college. Chatsworth assumed the role left vacant by the departure of Milton from the series. Like Dobie, Chatsworth also briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.\n*[[William Schallert]], as Professor Leander Pomfritt, is a dry wit English and science teacher at Dobie's high school and later one of Dobie's college professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College (seasons 1, 2 and 3). [[Herbert Anderson]] plays Mr. Pomfritt in the pilot episode.\n*[[Jean Byron]], as Mrs. Ruth Adams, is Dobie's math teacher in high school (season 1) and Dr. Imogene Burkhart, one of Dobie's professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College. (seasons 3 and 4). One of the series inside jokes was that Jean Byron's birth name was Imogene Audette Burkhart.\n*[[Doris Packer]], as Mrs. Clarice Armitage, is Milton's mother, a rich and eccentric socialite. She shifted to Mrs. Clarissa Osborne ([[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]]'s mother) when Franken replaced Beatty midway through season one. She has disdain for anyone outside her social class and considers all boys, including her own son, as \"nasty\".\n\n===Notable recurring roles===\n*[[Darryl Hickman]], as Davey Gillis (season 1), is Dobie's older brother, a college student no more responsible and no less girl-crazy than Dobie. Davey was written out of the series after season one and Dobie is regarded as an only child thereafter.\n*[[Michael J. Pollard]], as Jerome Krebs (season 1), is Maynard's cousin, also a beatnik. Jerome was intended as a replacement for Maynard when Bob Denver was drafted in mid-1959, and was written out of the show after Denver failed his Army physical and returned to the series.\n*[[Marjorie Bennett]], as Blossom Kenney (seasons 1 and 2), is a frequent and persnickety customer of the Gillises' grocery store.\n*[[Tommy Farrell]], as Riff Ryan (seasons 1 and 2), is a beatnik record store owner and coffee house proprietor who serves as something of a reluctant mentor for Maynard.\n*[[Lynn Loring]], as Edwina \"Eddie\" Kegel (season 3), Chatsworth Osborne Jr.'s [[beatnik]] cousin.\n*[[Raymond Bailey]], as Dean McGruder (seasons 3 and 4), is head of S. Peter Pryor Junior College.\n\n==Episodes== \n{{Main|List of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episodes}}\n{{:List of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episodes}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rodin-Denker-Kyoto.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Auguste Rodin]]'s statue of ''[[The Thinker]]'']]\nMax Shulman's first Dobie Gillis short stories were printed in 1945, and a short story compilation, ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'', was published in 1951.<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\" /> These stories were originally published in such magazines as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.\n\nA follow-up collection, ''I Was a Teen-Age Dwarf'', appeared in 1959. The titular character appeared at various ages in these stories, all of which are set in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], though the majority of the stories centered on his college years at the [[University of Minnesota]].<ref>Shulman, Max.

Following its release, Shulman set about attempting to bring ''Dobie Gillis'' to television. An initial pilot was produced by veteran comedian and producer [[George Burns]] in 1957, with his son [[Ronnie Burns (actor)|Ronnie Burns]] starring as Dobie.<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nAfter this pilot did not sell, Shulman took ''Dobie Gillis'' to [[20th Century Fox Television]], run at the time by [[Martin Manulis]]. Manulis asked Shulman to reduce the Dobie character's age from 19 to 17, making him a high-school student instead of a college student and an age peer of [[Ricky Nelson]] from ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'' and [[Wally Cleaver]] ([[Tony Dow]]) from ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''.<ref name=\"HoneyImHome\">Jones, Gerard (1993).

Krebs, and Tuesday Weld as Dobie's unattainable love interest Thalia Menninger.\n\nFirst pitched to and rejected by NBC, ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' was greenlit for series by CBS. [[Philip Morris USA|Phillip Morris]]' [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] was the program's primary sponsor, and it sold a week-to-week alternating co-sponsorship to [[Pillsbury Company]] for the first two seasons, with Dwayne Hickman appearing in one of the Pillsbury commercials.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> [[Colgate-Palmolive]] replaced Pillsbury as the alternate sponsor in season three.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/>\n\nWhile the pilot for ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' was shot at the main [[20th Century Fox]] lot in [[Century City, California]], principal photography and production for the series proper took place at the original Fox Film Corporation studio at the intersection of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and [[Western Avenue (Los Angeles)|Western Avenue]] (next to the headquarters of [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc.|DeLuxe]]) in [[Hollywood]].<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> ''Dobie Gillis'' was [[multi-camera setup|filmed with two cameras]], a method that producer and director [[Rod Amateau]] had learned while working on ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]''. Fox turned out one episode of ''Dobie Gillis'' a week, working from May to December of each year. Dwayne Hickman's fourth-wall-breaking monologues were saved for the end of the production of each episode; their length resulted in Hickman requesting and getting a [[teleprompter]] from which to read them for season two forward.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nThe show was not filmed before a [[live studio audience]]; during the first season, a live audience viewed each episode and provided its [[laugh track]].<ref name=\"tweedle20100610\">{{cite interview|title=Hollywood Everyman: A Conversation with William Schallert|date=June 10, 2010|accessdate=December 12, 2011|url=http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/williamschallerti|last=Schallert|first=William|subjectlink=William Schallert|interviewer=Tweedle, Sam|work=Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117134300/http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/williamschallerti/|archivedate=January 17, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Subsequent seasons used a standard laugh track provided by technician [[Charles Douglass]].{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |pp=9\u201321}}\n\nCreator Max Shulman served as the show runner for and an uncredited producer of ''Dobie Gillis''.<ref name=\"STUEP5\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=Nov 3, 2010 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php |title=Program 202 \u2014 Steve Franken |website=The Stu's Show Archives |access-date=Sep 9, 2013}}</ref> He contributed scripts for episodes of the show during all four seasons, with several stories \u2013 including \"Love is a Science\" (season 1, episode 3), \"Love is a Fallacy\" (season 1, episode 22), and \"Parlez-Vous English\" (season 2, episode 11) \u2013 directly adapted by Shulman from his original Dobie Gillis short stories.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/><ref name=\"STUEP5\"/>\n\nDuring its fourth season, the show, by then known as ''Max Shulman's Dobie Gillis'', suffered both from competition with NBC's color Western ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' and from the growing inattention from Max Shulman.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Shulman began spending increasing amounts of time at his home in [[Westport, Connecticut]] while the show was in active production,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/> ceding his role as show runner to associate producers Joel Kane and Guy Scarpitta.

Maynard's return was explained by stating that the Army had given Maynard a \"hardship discharge\" \u2013 the Army's hardship, not Maynard's.<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/><ref>[http://www.peteranthonyholder.com/cjad27.htm CJAD 800 AM, Montreal radio interview with Bob Denver], peteranthonyholder.com; accessed February 7, 2016.</ref>\n\nInitially, only a supporting character, Denver's Maynard had graduated to co-lead by season two, as the character's \"beatnik\" mannerisms and eccentricities made him a hit with the viewing audience.<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/> For a handful of episodes towards the end of season three, Maynard became the show's lead character while Dwayne Hickman was hospitalized with and later recovering from [[pneumonia]].{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} \n\nDespite Maynard's rise in popularity and increased screen time, however, Denver \u2013 who had signed on as a Fox contract player without an agent \u2013 was unable to negotiate a raise in his $250/week salary until season four.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |pp=9\u201321}}<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/> Denver was able to parlay his role on ''Dobie Gillis'' into lead roles on later television series, in particular the one for which he is best remembered, the 1964\u201367 CBS sitcom ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''.<ref name=\"STUEP7\"/>\n\nVeteran actors Frank Faylen, a longtime acquaintance of the Hickman family and a fellow parishioner at their church,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and Florida Friebus were cast as Dobie's parents, Herbert T. Gillis and Winifred Gillis. Faylen's gruff, no-nonsense father character \u2013 which, according to Hickman, was essentially the same as Faylen's real-life personality{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} \u2013 was more of an antagonist to Dobie during the first season of the show, his demeanor underscored by his often-repeated catchphrase \"I gotta kill that boy! I just gotta!\" Both CBS and Marlboro strongly disapproved of the catchphrase and the Herbert T. Gillis character's hard edges.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} An early season-two episode, \"You Ain't Nothin' But a Houn' Dog\" (episode 2), in which Dobie inadvertently wins a father-and-son essay contest, was produced to explain why Herbert ceased use of his catchphrase. Herbert was further softened as the series bore on, the character's anger tempered to frustration.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Recurring casting notes===\nExperienced child actress Tuesday Weld was cast as Dobie's love interest in \"Caper at the Bijou\" and stayed on as a semiregular. Weld and Dwayne Hickman had previously appeared as a teenage couple in the 1958 Fox feature film ''[[Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys!]]'', based on a Max Shulman novel, though produced without his input.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Neither Hickman nor Weld was fond of the other, with Hickman later stating he felt Weld was not as dedicated as necessary to rehearsal and referring to her as \"a pain in the neck\". Weld reportedly found Hickman pushy and out-of-touch. Aged 15 at the time of shooting the pilot, Weld had to legally spend much of her time onset in school with a tutor,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and the production periodically ran into issues involving Weld's later publicly known difficult home life.<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\">{{Cite video |title=Interview with Sheila James Kuehl |medium=Video |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation]] |date=2013 |url=http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/sheila-kuehl}}</ref> \n\nHer work in ''Dobie Gillis'' and the feature film ''[[The Five Pennies]]'' made Weld a star, leading to substantial publicity.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |pp=9\u201321}} She departed the series after the first year to star in features, although she was persuaded by Max Shulman to return for two guest appearances, \"Birth of a Salesman\" (season 3, episode 21) and \"What's a Little Murder Between Friends?\" (season 4, episode 2).{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nHerbert Anderson was cast as Mr. Pomfritt, Dobie and Maynard's English teacher at school. Anderson appeared in a lead role in the pilot for ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]''; when that show was picked up (also by CBS), he chose to stay with that cast, and veteran actor William Schallert appeared in the recurring role of Mr. Pomfritt through the end of season three.\n\nWarren Beatty was cast as Milton Armitage, a recurring rival of Dobie's at his high school, during the first half of season one.<ref name=\"Beatty\"/> Hickman later recalled that Beatty \"looked at me like I was a bug\" while on set.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Beatty did remain friends with his brief co-star [[Michael J. Pollard]]. The two co-starred in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' eight years later. He quit the series in September 1959, midway through production of the first season after filming his fifth and final ''Dobie'' episode, \"The Smoke-Filled Room\", to appear in ''A Loss of Roses'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name=\"Beatty\">Finstead, Susan (2008). ''Warren Beatty: A Private Man''.

Signing a contract with ''Dobie Gillis'' necessitated James, then an eighteen-year-old college student, changing her major from theater to English, so Shulman could assist her with her studies on set.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/>\n\nAfter the third season of ''Dobie Gillis'', Rod Amateau and Max Shulman produced a pilot for a ''Zelda'' spinoff starring Sheila James as Zelda Gilroy, with [[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]] and Jean Byron cast as her parents.<ref name=\"STUEP3\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=July 17, 2013 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php?y=2013 |title=Program 331 \u2014 Sheila James Kuehl |website=The Stu's Show Archives |access-date=July 25, 2013}}</ref> However, CBS president [[James Aubrey]] lingered over moving forward with the ''Zelda'' series for a long time before firmly rejecting the series, with Amateau telling James in private that Aubrey had found ''Zelda'' (and by extension James, then a closeted lesbian) \"too butch\".<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\"/> James' contract for the pilot and the resulting waiting period caused her to be absent from much of the fourth and final season of ''Dobie Gillis'', though Amateau was able to hire her to return as Zelda for four episodes towards the end of the season.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Acting roles became sparse for James by the late 1960s; she went into law and politics under her birth name of Sheila Kuehl and later became the first openly gay person elected to the [[California State Legislature]].<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\"/>\n\nSteve Franken, a 28-year-old veteran character actor, was cast immediately after Beatty's departure as Chatsworth Osbourne, Jr, a replacement character for Milton Armitage. While both Milton and Chatsworth were rich rivals of Dobie Gillis (and both characters shared the same actress, [[Doris Packer]], for a mother) and were, according to canon, cousins, where Beatty's Milton was a menacing and athletic physical threat, Franken's pompous, foppish Chatsworth tended to plot and scheme his way through competitions with Dobie, more often than not using his riches to get ahead.<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/> The Chatsworth character became popular enough that the producers had to consciously limit his appearances on the series to roughly one per month to prevent Franken from upstaging Hickman and Denver, but Franken stated both during and after ''Dobie Gillis'' that playing Chatsworth led him to be typecast and stifled his career.<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/>\n\nYoung actor Bobby Diamond was brought on at the beginning of season four as Dobie's teenaged cousin, Duncan \"Dunky\" Gillis. By 1962, the 28-year-old Dwayne Hickman had begun to look too mature to carry the teenager-based plot lines,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and instead Diamond's \"Dunky\" was given this material, with the older yet immature Maynard as a running partner. The character was dropped midway through the fourth season, with attention shifting back to the characters of Dobie, Maynard, Chatsworth, and Zelda for the remaining episodes of the series.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nActresses who played Dobie's love interests included [[Cheryl Holdridge]], [[Michele Lee]], [[Susan Watson]], [[Marlo Thomas]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Ellen Burstyn]] (then billed as Ellen McRae), [[Barbara Babcock]], [[Sherry Jackson]] and [[Danielle De Metz]]. [[Yvonne Craig]] appeared in the opening credits and the closing sequence of the pilot film used to sell the series to CBS but did not appear in the actual episode, \"Caper at The Bijou\", when it was broadcast. She would eventually play five different girlfriends on the show, more than any other actress.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Other media==\nAfter the first season of ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' had aired, [[Capitol Records]] attempted to make a recording star out of Dwayne Hickman, ignoring the fact that Hickman, by his own admission, was not a singer.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Recording engineers had to piece together numerous takes to get a usable vocal track from Hickman for each song. Hickman introduced several of the songs from the ''Dobie!'' album on the show during its second season, including \"I'm a Lover, Not a Fighter\" and \"Don't Send a Rabbit\".{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Earlier, while Hickman was appearing on ''[[Love That Bob]]'', he had recorded a single, \"School Dance\", for [[ABC-Paramount Records]], but both the single and the later Capitol album sold very few copies.<ref>[http://www.famousinterview.ca/interviews/dwayne_hickman.htm Dwayne Hickman interview], famousinterview.ca; accessed February 7, 2016.</ref>\n\n[[DC Comics]] published a ''Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' comic book that ran for 26 issues from 1960 to 1964, featuring artwork by [[Bob Oksner]].

Shulman also wrote a feature film adaptation of his \"Dobie Gillis\" stories for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1953, entitled ''[[The Affairs of Dobie Gillis]]'' which featured [[Bobby Van]] in the title role.\n\n''Dobie Gillis'' is significant as the first American television program produced for a major network to feature teenagers as leading characters. In other series, such as ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' and ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', teenagers were portrayed as supporting characters in a family story. An even earlier 1954 series, ''[[Meet Corliss Archer (TV series)|Meet Corliss Archer]]'', featured teenagers in leading roles and aired in syndication.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> ''Dobie Gillis'' broke ground by depicting elements of the current  [[counterculture]], particularly the [[Beat Generation]], primarily embodied in a stereotypical version of the \"beatnik\".{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Series star [[Dwayne Hickman]] would later say that ''Dobie'' represented \u201cthe end of innocence of the 1950s before the oncoming 1960s revolution\u201d.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\n==Overview==\n===Dobie Gillis and Maynard G. Krebs===\n[[File:Dobie gillis 1960.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman, left), [[Maynard G. Krebs]] (Bob Denver, right) and one of Dobie's \"many loves\", Yvette LeBlanc ([[Danielle De Metz]]), in a still from the ''Dobie Gillis'' episode \"Parlez-Vous English\", originally aired December 27, 1960]]\nThe series revolved around teenager Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman), who aspired to have popularity, money, and the attention of beautiful and unattainable girls. He did not have any of these qualities in abundance, and the tiny crises surrounding Dobie's lack of success made the story in each weekly episode. Also constantly in question, by Dobie and others, was Dobie's future, as the boy proved to be a poor student and an aimless drifter.\n\nHis sidekick and de facto best friend was American television's first [[beatnik]], [[Maynard G. Krebs]] ([[Bob Denver]]), who became the series' [[breakout character]]. An enthusiastic fan of [[jazz music]] (with a strong distaste for the music of [[Lawrence Welk]]), Maynard plays the [[bongo drum|bongos]], collects tinfoil and petrified frogs, and steers clear of romance, authority figures, and work (yelping \"Work?!\" every time he hears the word). Always speaking with the vernacular and slang of the beatniks and jazz musicians he admired, Maynard punctuates his sentences with the word \"[[Like (discourse particle)|like]]\" and has a tendency towards [[malapropism]]s. The main running gag on ''Dobie Gillis'' would have Dobie or one of the other characters rattling off a series of adjectives describing something undesirable or disgusting (\"I'd be a ragged, useless, dirty wreck!\"), at which point a previously unseen Maynard would appear (entering the scene in close-up), saying \"You rang?\"\n\n''Dobie Gillis'' is set in Central City, a fictitious city in the [[Midwestern United States]] (the original short stories are explicitly set in the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] area). One of the show's running gags is the reference, especially by Maynard, to a movie called ''The Monster that Devoured Cleveland'' and its sequels, one of which always seems to be playing at the local cinema.\n\n===Supporting characters===\nDobie's often apoplectic father, Herbert T. Gillis ([[Frank Faylen]]), owned a grocery store and was only happy when Dobie was behind a broom. Dobie's mother, Winifred ([[Florida Friebus]]), was a usually calm and serene woman who protected Dobie to the best of her ability and tended to baby him. Herbert Gillis, a proud, hard-working child of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] veteran, was often (during the first season of the show) heard to declare, in relation to Dobie, \"I gotta kill that boy, I just gotta!\" The Gillis family also originally included an older son, Davey Gillis (portrayed by Dwayne Hickman's own older brother, [[Darryl Hickman]]), who made three appearances during the first season while home on break from college before being written out of the show.<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nDobie's two main [[antagonist]]s were rich kids Milton Armitage (played by [[Warren Beatty]]), who appeared in five episodes, and, after Beatty's departure, Chatsworth Osborne Jr., Milton's cousin (played by [[Steve Franken]]). Both characters represented the wealth and popularity to which Dobie aspired, but also served as romantic and competitive rivals for Dobie. Beatty's Milton was taller, better looking, and more athletic than Chatsworth. [[Doris Packer]] played Clarissa Osborne, Chatsworth's overbearing and snobbish mother.\n\nDobie was hopelessly attracted to the beautiful but greedy blonde [[Thalia Menninger]] ([[Tuesday Weld]]). Thalia was written out of the series after the first season and was succeeded by a seemingly endless stream of women for whom Dobie hankered. Weld returned as a slightly wiser Thalia for two guest appearances in season 3 and 4.\n\n[[Zelda Gilroy]] ([[Sheila Kuehl|Sheila James]]) was a brilliant and eager young girl, hopelessly in love with Dobie, much to his annoyance. Zelda did not find Dobie particularly attractive, but fell in love with him because she found him helpless and needing of her care, and also because of the concept of \"[[propinquity]]\" (or nearness; as Gillis and Gilroy, they were typically [[Alphabetical order#Ordering by surname|seated together]] in class).<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Despite his protests, Dobie was clearly fond of Zelda, and Zelda claimed Dobie loved her but just had not realized it yet. To prove this, she would wrinkle her nose at Dobie, who would reflexively do the same back to Zelda and then protest \"now cut that out!\" Dobie and Zelda would later appear as a middle-aged married couple in the two spin-off ''Dobie Gillis'' reunion projects of the 1970s/1980s.\n\nLeander Pomfritt ([[Herbert Anderson]] in the pilot, [[William Schallert]] thereafter) was Dobie's English and science teacher at Central High School and later, when Dobie went to S. Peter Pryor Junior College, Pomfritt (played by Schallert) was on the faculty there as well. A stern educator fond of [[deadpan]] quips, Pomfritt referred to his pupils as \"my young barbarians\" and served as a father figure to both Dobie and Maynard.\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Bob Denver Dobie Gillis 1961.jpg|thumb|Maynard was not prepared to give up his beard after entering the army. Bob Denver and Kay Elhardt are featured in this still from the ''Dobie Gillis'' episode \"The Ballad of Maynard's Beard\", originally aired April 18, 1961.]]\nMost of the action for the first season-and-a-half of ''Dobie Gillis'' centered on the Gillis grocery store, Central High School, and the Central City park. The park scenes are used as the show's [[Frame story|framing device]], with Dobie sitting on a park bench in front of a reproduction of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s statue, ''[[The Thinker]]''. Breaking the [[fourth wall]], he would explain to the viewing audience his problem of the week, usually girls or money (in the earliest episodes, Dobie is seen emulating the trademark pose of ''The Thinker'' \u2013 head planted on fist in deep contemplation \u2013 before turning and acknowledging the camera).<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nThe teen characters graduated from high school halfway through the second season, and Dobie and Maynard (along with Chatsworth) subsequently did a brief stint in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> Dobie continued to break the fourth wall and narrate the episodes, with the park set eschewed for an abstract set with the same reproduction of \"The Thinker.\"\n\nAt the start of the third season, Dobie and Maynard received their Army discharges and they, Zelda, and Chatsworth enroll in S. Peter Pryor [[junior college|Junior College]], where Mr. Pomfritt was now a professor after having resigned from his position at Central High. Dobie's science and history teacher at the college was Dr. Imogene Burkhart ([[Jean Byron]], whose real name was used for that of the character). In season four, Dobie's teenaged cousin Duncan \"Dunky\" Gillis ([[Bobby Diamond]]) moves in with the Gillises, and becomes something of a tag-along for Dobie and Maynard. The fourth-season episodes tended more towards surreal plots and situations featuring Maynard as the central character rather than Dobie.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |p=56}}\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Dwayne Hickman]], as Dobie Gillis, is a clean-cut teenager (later young adult), an unremarkable student whose young heart finds poetry and literature resonant. He aspires to have dates with all of the beautiful girls he pursues, despite the pressures of home life, high school, and later the military and college. Dobie also serves as the series narrator, relating his observations to the audience from in front of a statue of Rodin's ''The Thinker''.\n*[[Frank Faylen]], as Herbert T. Gillis, is Dobie's old-fashioned, short-tempered, and gruff father, who runs a small independent grocery store.\n*[[Florida Friebus]], as Winifred \"Winnie\" Gillis, is Dobie's doting mother, who tends to baby her son and critique her husband's parenting skills.\n*[[Bob Denver]], as [[Maynard G. Krebs]], is Dobie's lazy and somewhat goofy best friend, a would-be beatnik who shuns romance, authority figures, and work. Like Dobie does later, Maynard briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.\n\n===Semiregulars===\n*[[Tuesday Weld]], as Thalia Menninger (season 1), is a beautiful high school classmate of Dobie's who is only willing to date Dobie when he has money or helps her in her schemes to make some for herself (with a father in poor health and a sister who married a layabout, Thalia sees it as her duty to bring some money into the family; she acknowledges that were this not a factor, she would date Dobie).<ref>The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, episode 1- 'Caper at the Bijou'</ref> Weld departed the series after the first season, later returning to make two guest appearances, as a somewhat chastened Thalia, once in season 3 and once in season 4.\n*[[Warren Beatty]], as Milton Armitage (season 1), is a rich jock at Dobie's high school and a rival of Dobie for Thalia's affections. Beatty quit the series midway through the first season.\n*[[Sheila Kuehl|Sheila James]], as [[Zelda Gilroy]], is the smartest girl in Dobie's high school and college, who is in love with the uninterested Dobie and schemes ways to get him to date and marry her.\n*[[Steve Franken]], as [[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]], is a spoiled rich boy and a classmate of Dobie's in high school and college. Chatsworth assumed the role left vacant by the departure of Milton from the series. Like Dobie, Chatsworth also briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.\n*[[William Schallert]], as Professor Leander Pomfritt, is a dry wit English and science teacher at Dobie's high school and later one of Dobie's college professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College (seasons 1, 2 and 3). [[Herbert Anderson]] plays Mr. Pomfritt in the pilot episode.\n*[[Jean Byron]], as Mrs. Ruth Adams, is Dobie's math teacher in high school (season 1) and Dr. Imogene Burkhart, one of Dobie's professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College. (seasons 3 and 4). One of the series inside jokes was that Jean Byron's birth name was Imogene Audette Burkhart.\n*[[Doris Packer]], as Mrs. Clarice Armitage, is Milton's mother, a rich and eccentric socialite. She shifted to Mrs. Clarissa Osborne ([[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]]'s mother) when Franken replaced Beatty midway through season one. She has disdain for anyone outside her social class and considers all boys, including her own son, as \"nasty\".\n\n===Notable recurring roles===\n*[[Darryl Hickman]], as Davey Gillis (season 1), is Dobie's older brother, a college student no more responsible and no less girl-crazy than Dobie. Davey was written out of the series after season one and Dobie is regarded as an only child thereafter.\n*[[Michael J. Pollard]], as Jerome Krebs (season 1), is Maynard's cousin, also a beatnik. Jerome was intended as a replacement for Maynard when Bob Denver was drafted in mid-1959, and was written out of the show after Denver failed his Army physical and returned to the series.\n*[[Marjorie Bennett]], as Blossom Kenney (seasons 1 and 2), is a frequent and persnickety customer of the Gillises' grocery store.\n*[[Tommy Farrell]], as Riff Ryan (seasons 1 and 2), is a beatnik record store owner and coffee house proprietor who serves as something of a reluctant mentor for Maynard.\n*[[Lynn Loring]], as Edwina \"Eddie\" Kegel (season 3), Chatsworth Osborne Jr.'s [[beatnik]] cousin.\n*[[Raymond Bailey]], as Dean McGruder (seasons 3 and 4), is head of S. Peter Pryor Junior College.\n\n==Episodes== \n{{Main|List of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episodes}}\n{{:List of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episodes}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rodin-Denker-Kyoto.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Auguste Rodin]]'s statue of ''[[The Thinker]]'']]\nMax Shulman's first Dobie Gillis short stories were printed in 1945, and a short story compilation, ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'', was published in 1951.<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\" /> These stories were originally published in such magazines as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.\n\nA follow-up collection, ''I Was a Teen-Age Dwarf'', appeared in 1959.

[[Philip Morris USA|Phillip Morris]]' [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] was the program's primary sponsor, and it sold a week-to-week alternating co-sponsorship to [[Pillsbury Company]] for the first two seasons, with Dwayne Hickman appearing in one of the Pillsbury commercials.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> [[Colgate-Palmolive]] replaced Pillsbury as the alternate sponsor in season three.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/>\n\nWhile the pilot for ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' was shot at the main [[20th Century Fox]] lot in [[Century City, California]], principal photography and production for the series proper took place at the original Fox Film Corporation studio at the intersection of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and [[Western Avenue (Los Angeles)|Western Avenue]] (next to the headquarters of [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc.|DeLuxe]]) in [[Hollywood]].<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> ''Dobie Gillis'' was [[multi-camera setup|filmed with two cameras]], a method that producer and director [[Rod Amateau]] had learned while working on ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]''. Fox turned out one episode of ''Dobie Gillis'' a week, working from May to December of each year. Dwayne Hickman's fourth-wall-breaking monologues were saved for the end of the production of each episode; their length resulted in Hickman requesting and getting a [[teleprompter]] from which to read them for season two forward.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nThe show was not filmed before a [[live studio audience]]; during the first season, a live audience viewed each episode and provided its [[laugh track]].<ref name=\"tweedle20100610\">{{cite interview|title=Hollywood Everyman: A Conversation with William Schallert|date=June 10, 2010|accessdate=December 12, 2011|url=http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/williamschallerti|last=Schallert|first=William|subjectlink=William Schallert|interviewer=Tweedle, Sam|work=Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117134300/http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/williamschallerti/|archivedate=January 17, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Subsequent seasons used a standard laugh track provided by technician [[Charles Douglass]].{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |pp=9\u201321}}\n\nCreator Max Shulman served as the show runner for and an uncredited producer of ''Dobie Gillis''.<ref name=\"STUEP5\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=Nov 3, 2010 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php |title=Program 202 \u2014 Steve Franken |website=The Stu's Show Archives |access-date=Sep 9, 2013}}</ref> He contributed scripts for episodes of the show during all four seasons, with several stories \u2013 including \"Love is a Science\" (season 1, episode 3), \"Love is a Fallacy\" (season 1, episode 22), and \"Parlez-Vous English\" (season 2, episode 11) \u2013 directly adapted by Shulman from his original Dobie Gillis short stories.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/><ref name=\"STUEP5\"/>\n\nDuring its fourth season, the show, by then known as ''Max Shulman's Dobie Gillis'', suffered both from competition with NBC's color Western ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' and from the growing inattention from Max Shulman.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Shulman began spending increasing amounts of time at his home in [[Westport, Connecticut]] while the show was in active production,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/> ceding his role as show runner to associate producers Joel Kane and Guy Scarpitta.

Gillis character's hard edges.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} An early season-two episode, \"You Ain't Nothin' But a Houn' Dog\" (episode 2), in which Dobie inadvertently wins a father-and-son essay contest, was produced to explain why Herbert ceased use of his catchphrase. Herbert was further softened as the series bore on, the character's anger tempered to frustration.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Recurring casting notes===\nExperienced child actress Tuesday Weld was cast as Dobie's love interest in \"Caper at the Bijou\" and stayed on as a semiregular. Weld and Dwayne Hickman had previously appeared as a teenage couple in the 1958 Fox feature film ''[[Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys!]]'', based on a Max Shulman novel, though produced without his input.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Neither Hickman nor Weld was fond of the other, with Hickman later stating he felt Weld was not as dedicated as necessary to rehearsal and referring to her as \"a pain in the neck\". Weld reportedly found Hickman pushy and out-of-touch. Aged 15 at the time of shooting the pilot, Weld had to legally spend much of her time onset in school with a tutor,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and the production periodically ran into issues involving Weld's later publicly known difficult home life.<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\">{{Cite video |title=Interview with Sheila James Kuehl |medium=Video |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation]] |date=2013 |url=http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/sheila-kuehl}}</ref> \n\nHer work in ''Dobie Gillis'' and the feature film ''[[The Five Pennies]]'' made Weld a star, leading to substantial publicity.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |pp=9\u201321}} She departed the series after the first year to star in features, although she was persuaded by Max Shulman to return for two guest appearances, \"Birth of a Salesman\" (season 3, episode 21) and \"What's a Little Murder Between Friends?\" (season 4, episode 2).{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nHerbert Anderson was cast as Mr. Pomfritt, Dobie and Maynard's English teacher at school. Anderson appeared in a lead role in the pilot for ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]''; when that show was picked up (also by CBS), he chose to stay with that cast, and veteran actor William Schallert appeared in the recurring role of Mr. Pomfritt through the end of season three.\n\nWarren Beatty was cast as Milton Armitage, a recurring rival of Dobie's at his high school, during the first half of season one.<ref name=\"Beatty\"/> Hickman later recalled that Beatty \"looked at me like I was a bug\" while on set.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Beatty did remain friends with his brief co-star [[Michael J. Pollard]]. The two co-starred in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' eight years later. He quit the series in September 1959, midway through production of the first season after filming his fifth and final ''Dobie'' episode, \"The Smoke-Filled Room\", to appear in ''A Loss of Roses'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name=\"Beatty\">Finstead, Susan (2008). ''Warren Beatty: A Private Man''. New York: Random House LLC, pp. 190\u2013220<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nVeteran child actress Sheila James, who, playing daughter \"Jackie\" on ''[[The Stu Erwin Show]]'', had worked with Dwayne Hickman on that series and ''The Bob Cummings Show'', was cast without an audition as Zelda Gilroy, the tomboyish brainy girl who was in love with Dobie.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Originally intended as a one-shot character for the episode \"Love is a Science\" (season 1, episode 3), Max Shulman liked both Zelda and Sheila James and had Zelda retained as a semi-regular character. Signing a contract with ''Dobie Gillis'' necessitated James, then an eighteen-year-old college student, changing her major from theater to English, so Shulman could assist her with her studies on set.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/>\n\nAfter the third season of ''Dobie Gillis'', Rod Amateau and Max Shulman produced a pilot for a ''Zelda'' spinoff starring Sheila James as Zelda Gilroy, with [[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]] and Jean Byron cast as her parents.<ref name=\"STUEP3\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=July 17, 2013 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php?y=2013 |title=Program 331 \u2014 Sheila James Kuehl |website=The Stu's Show Archives |access-date=July 25, 2013}}</ref> However, CBS president [[James Aubrey]] lingered over moving forward with the ''Zelda'' series for a long time before firmly rejecting the series, with Amateau telling James in private that Aubrey had found ''Zelda'' (and by extension James, then a closeted lesbian) \"too butch\".<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\"/> James' contract for the pilot and the resulting waiting period caused her to be absent from much of the fourth and final season of ''Dobie Gillis'', though Amateau was able to hire her to return as Zelda for four episodes towards the end of the season.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Acting roles became sparse for James by the late 1960s; she went into law and politics under her birth name of Sheila Kuehl and later became the first openly gay person elected to the [[California State Legislature]].<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\"/>\n\nSteve Franken, a 28-year-old veteran character actor, was cast immediately after Beatty's departure as Chatsworth Osbourne, Jr, a replacement character for Milton Armitage. While both Milton and Chatsworth were rich rivals of Dobie Gillis (and both characters shared the same actress, [[Doris Packer]], for a mother) and were, according to canon, cousins, where Beatty's Milton was a menacing and athletic physical threat, Franken's pompous, foppish Chatsworth tended to plot and scheme his way through competitions with Dobie, more often than not using his riches to get ahead.<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/> The Chatsworth character became popular enough that the producers had to consciously limit his appearances on the series to roughly one per month to prevent Franken from upstaging Hickman and Denver, but Franken stated both during and after ''Dobie Gillis'' that playing Chatsworth led him to be typecast and stifled his career.<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/>\n\nYoung actor Bobby Diamond was brought on at the beginning of season four as Dobie's teenaged cousin, Duncan \"Dunky\" Gillis. By 1962, the 28-year-old Dwayne Hickman had begun to look too mature to carry the teenager-based plot lines,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and instead Diamond's \"Dunky\" was given this material, with the older yet immature Maynard as a running partner. The character was dropped midway through the fourth season, with attention shifting back to the characters of Dobie, Maynard, Chatsworth, and Zelda for the remaining episodes of the series.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nActresses who played Dobie's love interests included [[Cheryl Holdridge]], [[Michele Lee]], [[Susan Watson]], [[Marlo Thomas]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Ellen Burstyn]] (then billed as Ellen McRae), [[Barbara Babcock]], [[Sherry Jackson]] and [[Danielle De Metz]]. [[Yvonne Craig]] appeared in the opening credits and the closing sequence of the pilot film used to sell the series to CBS but did not appear in the actual episode, \"Caper at The Bijou\", when it was broadcast. She would eventually play five different girlfriends on the show, more than any other actress.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Other media==\nAfter the first season of ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' had aired, [[Capitol Records]] attempted to make a recording star out of Dwayne Hickman, ignoring the fact that Hickman, by his own admission, was not a singer.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Recording engineers had to piece together numerous takes to get a usable vocal track from Hickman for each song. Hickman introduced several of the songs from the ''Dobie!'' album on the show during its second season, including \"I'm a Lover, Not a Fighter\" and \"Don't Send a Rabbit\".{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Earlier, while Hickman was appearing on ''[[Love That Bob]]'', he had recorded a single, \"School Dance\", for [[ABC-Paramount Records]], but both the single and the later Capitol album sold very few copies.<ref>[http://www.famousinterview.ca/interviews/dwayne_hickman.htm Dwayne Hickman interview], famousinterview.ca; accessed February 7, 2016.</ref>\n\n[[DC Comics]] published a ''Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' comic book that ran for 26 issues from 1960 to 1964, featuring artwork by [[Bob Oksner]]. Stories from this comic book series would later be reprinted, with updates to the artwork and lettering to remove any references to ''Dobie Gillis'', by DC as a short-lived series entitled ''Windy and Willy'' in 1969.<ref>[http://toonopedia.com/windywil.htm \"Windy and Willy\"] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

(1977) and the [[TV movie]] ''Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis'' (1988). ''Whatever Happened to Dobie Gillis?'' was an unsuccessful pilot for a new weekly sitcom series, which was produced, directed, and developed by [[James Komack]] after creator Max Shulman was fired from the production.<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> It was broadcast by CBS on May 10, 1977, as a one-shot special.

Cherry after Dwayne Hickman, who was the film's producer, was forced by the network to fire Max Shulman and Rod Amateau, with whom he had originally conceived the film.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/><ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> The plot features the married Dobie and Zelda running the Gillis Grocery \u2013 now also a pharmacy \u2013 on their own, Dobie's parents having died. Meanwhile, Thalia (played by [[Connie Stevens]] after Weld declined to reprise the role) returns to Central City \u2013 with Maynard, whom she has rescued from a deserted island \u2013 after 20 years (an homage to ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''), and offers a $50,000 bounty to anyone who will kill Dobie when he refuses to divorce Zelda and marry her. Hickman, Denver, and James returned for ''Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis'', which featured Steve Franken as Chatsworth, WIlliam Schallert as Mr. Pomfritt, and [[Scott Grimes]] as son Georgie Gillis.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/><ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> [[Connie Stevens]]' daughter, [[Tricia Leigh Fisher]], played Chatsworth's daughter Chatsie, who chased Georgie Gillis with the same zeal Zelda had once used chasing Dobie.\n\n==Home media==\nOn July 2, 2013, [[Shout!

He listed bullying, exploitation, poor pay and exhausting hours among his concerns. He also revealed that That's Solent sent 1,207 stories to the BBC in year one (November 2014 to November 2015) but the BBC used only 114 (9.4% of stories), equating to a cost of \u00a31,315 per story.<ref name=bella>{{Cite news|url=https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/07/30/selling-scotlands-local-television-to-thats-tv-is-a-travesty/|title=Selling Scotland\u2019s local television to That\u2019s TV is a travesty|date=2018-07-30|work=Bella Caledonia|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-GB}}</ref> The National Union of Journalists in Scotland said it was \"deeply concerned\" by McEwan's revelations and news that That's TV was launching five stations in Scotland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/nuj-voices-concern-over-thats-tv/|title=NUJ voices concern over That's TV|website=National Union of Journalists|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2018, McEwan continued his investigations into That's TV. Former That's TV staff members said the BBC was breaking its internal ethics code through its contract with the company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.starandcrescent.org.uk/2018/10/22/former-employees-call-for-bbc-investigation-of-thats-solent-tv/|title=Former Employees Call for BBC Investigation of That\u2019s Solent TV \u2013 Star & Crescent|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref> That's TV must adhere to the code as a supplier of video stories to the BBC.

This was one week after the birth of this freelancer's disabled child. A former unpaid intern claimed they could not afford tampons during their work with That's TV. It is claimed that That's TV is therefore breaking the BBC's code on this point.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nMcEwan wrote another investigative article in October 2018. He found that at least four colleges/universities had asked the local That's TV stations to leave the premises.<ref name=deliver>{{Cite web|url=https://www.starandcrescent.org.uk/2018/10/24/thats-solent-tv-delivering-for-portsmouth-students/|title=That\u2019s Solent TV: Delivering for Portsmouth Students?|date=24 October 2019|website=Star & Crescent|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref> For example, [[Queen Mary's College, Basingstoke|Queen Mary's College]] (QMC) in Basingstoke served notice on That's Hampshire in summer 2018 after the BuzzFeed investigation. That's TV did not, however, inform broadcast regulator [[Ofcom]] about the station's change of address; the QMC address was still displayed on Ofcom's website months after the station left QMC. McEwan also found evidence suggesting that That's Hampshire staff were sharing the office of That's Thames Valley in Reading. Ofcom said it is a licence condition for all local TV licensees to ensure that the main production base of the licensed service, and/or studio from which the licensed service is broadcast, is located within the licensed area. The regulator confirmed a station's office can be based outside of the licensed area, but prior written consent must be given. Ofcom said consent had not been given to That's TV. Ofcom added that it was investigating and would take action if it found a breach of licence had taken place. \n\nMcEwan wrote an investigative article for ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine in March 2019 where he revealed that That's TV was refusing to tell the public where stations are broadcasting from.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DaleSMcEwan/status/1108394373195157504|title=Private Eye magazine article \u2013 \"Local Difficulties\"|last=McEwan|first=Dale|date=2019-03-20|website=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> The report explained that That's TV deleted the addresses for its stations across the UK and replaced them with one contact address in a Lancashire business park. Ofcom also said it cannot give any details of where stations broadcast from. A longer version of the article was published by ''Star and Crescent'', where McEwan revealed that the first station to launch \u2013 That's Solent in 2014 \u2013 had left [[Highbury College]] in Portsmouth.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.starandcrescent.org.uk/2019/03/27/is-publicly-funded-local-tv-really-local-investigating-thats-tv/|title=How Local is That\u2019s Solent?

Viewers are uncertain if the station is in the Solent area: an observant viewer told McEwan that they saw a Salisbury postal address onscreen during a recent That's Solent news bulletin. \n\nIn May 2019, McEwan's investigations found that That's TV wanted to abandon the local communities it is publicly funded to serve.<ref name=will>{{Cite web|url=https://www.starandcrescent.org.uk/2019/05/15/will-publicly-funded-thats-solent-tv-leave-the-region-for-good/|title=Will Publicly-Funded That\u2019s Solent TV Leave the Region for Good?|date=15 May 2019|website=Star & Crescent|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> He found that That's TV had submitted plans to Ofcom to run the entire network of 20 local stations from seven studios/main production offices, which Ofcom had provisionally allowed.  \n\nWhen launching his local TV initiative in 2011, [[Jeremy Hunt]], then Culture Secretary, said, \"Eight out of 10 consider local news important. Nearly seven out of 10 adults feel localness of stories is more important than them being professionally produced. People in Barnham don\u2019t want to watch what is going on in Southampton. People in Chelmsford aren\u2019t interested in what\u2019s happening in Watford. That is the system we currently have at the moment, so that is what we are trying to rethink.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-12220187|title=Hunt outlines 'local TV' services|date=2011-01-19|access-date=2019-06-11|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nOfcom also revealed that it was not taking any action against That's TV for apparent licence breaches.<ref name=will /> But evidence had previously been found that That's TV had already started operating stations from outside of the local communities. This evidence was found before That's TV submitted its plans for studio/office sharing across the network (for example, That's Hampshire explained above). McEwan also pushed Ofcom for details about where stations were located. Ofcom gave limited details in a Freedom of Information response published in the same article. Six of That's TV's 20 stations already did not have a studio or office in the licensed area. Five licences had an office in the licensed area but used a studio outside of the area to record programmes. That's Solent was one of nine licences that Ofcom believed had a studio in the licensed area. However, in what appeared to be a blunder, a YouTube video showed a That's Solent presenter reading out the station contact details for That's Salisbury during a pre-recorded bulletin on 5 February 2019.<ref>{{Citation|last=superwonderstar|title=That's Solent - or is it Salisbury?|date=2019-03-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdwp937qdsU|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> The presenter then gave the contact details for That's Solent.\n\nA Freedom of Information reply from Highbury College disclosed that That's Solent left the college in November 2018 by \"mutual consent\", but did not elaborate further.<ref name=will /> The letter also showed that That's TV rented premises at Highbury for free during its entire four-year contract. This was despite the broadcaster standing to earn millions of pounds of BBC licence fee funding. That's TV had agreed to offer training opportunities to Highbury students in return for the studio and office space, but former That's Solent employees previously said That's TV was not benefiting Highbury students' education<ref name=deliver />\n\nIn July 2019, McEwan continued his investigations after Ofcom officially announced permission for That\u2019s TV to close 13 studios in its network of 20 local TV stations across the UK.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.starandcrescent.org.uk/2019/07/24/publicly-funded-thats-solent-tv-moves-local-broadcasting-to-salisbury/|title=Publicly-funded That\u2019s Solent TV moves \u2018local\u2019 broadcasting to Salisbury|last=|first=|date=24 July 2019|website=Star & Crescent|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-16}}</ref> That\u2019s TV was allowed to operate from seven regional studios, as predicted by McEwan in his previous report.<ref name=\"will\" /> For example, That\u2019s Solent was now included within a \u201cSouth of England\u201d hub and would be broadcast from That\u2019s Salisbury\u2019s studio in Salisbury along with the stations for Basingstoke, Guildford, Oxford and Reading. All news shows from these stations were to be hosted by presenters in Salisbury. But McEwan\u2019s previous investigation revealed signs that That\u2019s Solent had already departed from the Solent area and started broadcasting from Salisbury months before Ofcom gave consent for the move. A former That\u2019s Solent journalist, who wished to remain anonymous, described the decision as a \u201cjoke\u201d. A source close to That\u2019s TV employees also claimed staff read about nationwide studio closures on news sites rather than being told by management.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nOfcom\u2019s letter of approval to That\u2019s TV said journalists would still be based in the local licensed areas but without physical premises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0027/155583/Local-TV-studio-locations.pdf|title=LDTPS licences consent to certain changes in the location of main production bases and/or studios|last=|first=|date=8 July 2019|website=Ofcom|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Ofcom explained That\u2019s TV\u2019s \"commitment for journalists and reporters to continue to collect, develop and record interviews on location within the licensed area\u2026\" Ofcom believed this meant that the \"local presence\" of stations like That\u2019s Solent would be \u201cmaintained\u201d. The regulator also stated, \"That\u2019s TV has confirmed that viewers of the services will not notice any difference in the content broadcast, with news items and interviews still recorded within the licensed area\u2026\" But sites like Star & Crescent previously watched That\u2019s Solent news bulletins that aired many stories from outside of the Solent area.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, the top story in one news bulletin was about Salisbury, with the show also featuring stories from Basingstoke, Newbury and Birmingham. A former employee of another That\u2019s TV station said Ofcom\u2019s claim that viewers would not notice any difference in news content \"completely misses the point\". They said, \"Out of a total of usually six to ten stories (completely depending on video times), three or four are filmed within the station location and the remaining are filmed out with, usually a completely different city. The news programmes [at this station] have always contained news stories from out with the licensed area. This is the same for all over the UK.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn December 2019, Star & Crescent published the following update to its story about the closure of 13 studios in That\u2019s TV\u2019s network of 20 licences<ref name=\":3\" />: That\u2019s TV chief executive Daniel Cass had previously told BBC News in July 2019: \u2018Does it make sense to be investing resources in 20 physical premises where you\u2019re tying up quite a lot of your reporters and journalists in administration and technical work rather than doing what we\u2019re doing going forward, which is freeing them up to spend significant time to be journalists?\u2019<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48939451|title=Local TV chain That's TV shuts 13 studios|date=2019-07-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> This comment referred to That\u2019s TV\u2019s premises across the UK, and implied that the company had, or at least wanted to have, premises for each of its 20 licences. The comment implied that the company, \u2018going forward\u2019, wanted to do something different compared to what it had been doing. In the interest of accuracy, Star & Crescent found evidence that this is a misleading comment from Cass. Former That\u2019s TV Scotland freelancers said there was a lack of premises in Scotland, meaning there were not \u201820 physical premises\u2019 for each of the 20 licences. Freelancers said there was only one studio in Scotland, which served all of the five Scottish licences. Freelancers also had to work from home or use WiFi in Costas and Starbucks, or Regus business lounges, in their local areas. This was because, out of the five Scottish licences, Glasgow was the only locality that had a permanent production office. Prior to Cass\u2019 comment to BBC News in July 2019, Ofcom had also confirmed in a freedom of information reply in April 2019 that it had no address details for either production offices or studios in the licensed areas of Aberdeen, Ayr, Dundee and Edinburgh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/145531/local-tv-additional-questions-foi.pdf|title=Local TV additional questions FOI|last=|first=|date=23 April 2019|website=Ofcom|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref>.

The report also claimed that several of the company's stations had fewer than 30 viewers per day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/revealed-how-britains-biggest-local-tv-company-has-gamed|title=Revealed: How Britain's Biggest Local TV Company Has \"Gamed\" The BBC For Licence Fee Payers' Money|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en}}</ref> The same month, the Press Gazette reported that unpaid interns working for That's TV \"passed out through exhaustion\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/interns-at-bbc-funded-local-tv-company-say-they-passed-out-through-exhaustion/|title=Interns at BBC-funded local TV company say they passed out through exhaustion \u2013 Press Gazette|website=www.pressgazette.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, former That's Solent journalist Dale McEwan reported his own experiences of working for the organisation. He listed bullying, exploitation, poor pay and exhausting hours among his concerns. He also revealed that That's Solent sent 1,207 stories to the BBC in year one (November 2014 to November 2015) but the BBC used only 114 (9.4% of stories), equating to a cost of \u00a31,315 per story.<ref name=bella>{{Cite news|url=https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/07/30/selling-scotlands-local-television-to-thats-tv-is-a-travesty/|title=Selling Scotland\u2019s local television to That\u2019s TV is a travesty|date=2018-07-30|work=Bella Caledonia|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-GB}}</ref> The National Union of Journalists in Scotland said it was \"deeply concerned\" by McEwan's revelations and news that That's TV was launching five stations in Scotland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/nuj-voices-concern-over-thats-tv/|title=NUJ voices concern over That's TV|website=National Union of Journalists|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2018, McEwan continued his investigations into That's TV. Former That's TV staff members said the BBC was breaking its internal ethics code through its contract with the company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.starandcrescent.org.uk/2018/10/22/former-employees-call-for-bbc-investigation-of-thats-solent-tv/|title=Former Employees Call for BBC Investigation of That\u2019s Solent TV \u2013 Star & Crescent|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref> That's TV must adhere to the code as a supplier of video stories to the BBC. As the code states, suppliers \u201cmust pay wages sufficient to meet basic needs and to provide some discretionary income\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/supplying/pdf/BBC_Ethical_Policy.pdf|title=BBC Code of Ethical Policy}}</ref> But That's TV's decision to pay staff the National Minimum Wage on zero-hour contracts and expect them to cover their own large petrol costs means that staff are effectively earning poverty wages.<ref name=bella /> As McEwan found, one former staff member said That's TV director Dan Cass asked them if they would be willing to go from paid to unpaid, but the individual refused. This was one week after the birth of this freelancer's disabled child. A former unpaid intern claimed they could not afford tampons during their work with That's TV. It is claimed that That's TV is therefore breaking the BBC's code on this point.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nMcEwan wrote another investigative article in October 2018. He found that at least four colleges/universities had asked the local That's TV stations to leave the premises.<ref name=deliver>{{Cite web|url=https://www.starandcrescent.org.uk/2018/10/24/thats-solent-tv-delivering-for-portsmouth-students/|title=That\u2019s Solent TV: Delivering for Portsmouth Students?|date=24 October 2019|website=Star & Crescent|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref> For example, [[Queen Mary's College, Basingstoke|Queen Mary's College]] (QMC) in Basingstoke served notice on That's Hampshire in summer 2018 after the BuzzFeed investigation. That's TV did not, however, inform broadcast regulator [[Ofcom]] about the station's change of address; the QMC address was still displayed on Ofcom's website months after the station left QMC. McEwan also found evidence suggesting that That's Hampshire staff were sharing the office of That's Thames Valley in Reading. Ofcom said it is a licence condition for all local TV licensees to ensure that the main production base of the licensed service, and/or studio from which the licensed service is broadcast, is located within the licensed area. The regulator confirmed a station's office can be based outside of the licensed area, but prior written consent must be given. Ofcom said consent had not been given to That's TV. Ofcom added that it was investigating and would take action if it found a breach of licence had taken place. \n\nMcEwan wrote an investigative article for ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine in March 2019 where he revealed that That's TV was refusing to tell the public where stations are broadcasting from.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DaleSMcEwan/status/1108394373195157504|title=Private Eye magazine article \u2013 \"Local Difficulties\"|last=McEwan|first=Dale|date=2019-03-20|website=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> The report explained that That's TV deleted the addresses for its stations across the UK and replaced them with one contact address in a Lancashire business park. Ofcom also said it cannot give any details of where stations broadcast from. A longer version of the article was published by ''Star and Crescent'', where McEwan revealed that the first station to launch \u2013 That's Solent in 2014 \u2013 had left [[Highbury College]] in Portsmouth.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.starandcrescent.org.uk/2019/03/27/is-publicly-funded-local-tv-really-local-investigating-thats-tv/|title=How Local is That\u2019s Solent?

Viewers are uncertain if the station is in the Solent area: an observant viewer told McEwan that they saw a Salisbury postal address onscreen during a recent That's Solent news bulletin. \n\nIn May 2019, McEwan's investigations found that That's TV wanted to abandon the local communities it is publicly funded to serve.<ref name=will>{{Cite web|url=https://www.starandcrescent.org.uk/2019/05/15/will-publicly-funded-thats-solent-tv-leave-the-region-for-good/|title=Will Publicly-Funded That\u2019s Solent TV Leave the Region for Good?|date=15 May 2019|website=Star & Crescent|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> He found that That's TV had submitted plans to Ofcom to run the entire network of 20 local stations from seven studios/main production offices, which Ofcom had provisionally allowed.  \n\nWhen launching his local TV initiative in 2011, [[Jeremy Hunt]], then Culture Secretary, said, \"Eight out of 10 consider local news important. Nearly seven out of 10 adults feel localness of stories is more important than them being professionally produced. People in Barnham don\u2019t want to watch what is going on in Southampton. People in Chelmsford aren\u2019t interested in what\u2019s happening in Watford. That is the system we currently have at the moment, so that is what we are trying to rethink.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-12220187|title=Hunt outlines 'local TV' services|date=2011-01-19|access-date=2019-06-11|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nOfcom also revealed that it was not taking any action against That's TV for apparent licence breaches.<ref name=will /> But evidence had previously been found that That's TV had already started operating stations from outside of the local communities. This evidence was found before That's TV submitted its plans for studio/office sharing across the network (for example, That's Hampshire explained above). McEwan also pushed Ofcom for details about where stations were located. Ofcom gave limited details in a Freedom of Information response published in the same article. Six of That's TV's 20 stations already did not have a studio or office in the licensed area. Five licences had an office in the licensed area but used a studio outside of the area to record programmes. That's Solent was one of nine licences that Ofcom believed had a studio in the licensed area. However, in what appeared to be a blunder, a YouTube video showed a That's Solent presenter reading out the station contact details for That's Salisbury during a pre-recorded bulletin on 5 February 2019.<ref>{{Citation|last=superwonderstar|title=That's Solent - or is it Salisbury?|date=2019-03-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdwp937qdsU|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> The presenter then gave the contact details for That's Solent.\n\nA Freedom of Information reply from Highbury College disclosed that That's Solent left the college in November 2018 by \"mutual consent\", but did not elaborate further.<ref name=will /> The letter also showed that That's TV rented premises at Highbury for free during its entire four-year contract. This was despite the broadcaster standing to earn millions of pounds of BBC licence fee funding. That's TV had agreed to offer training opportunities to Highbury students in return for the studio and office space, but former That's Solent employees previously said That's TV was not benefiting Highbury students' education<ref name=deliver />\n\nIn July 2019, McEwan continued his investigations after Ofcom officially announced permission for That\u2019s TV to close 13 studios in its network of 20 local TV stations across the UK.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.starandcrescent.org.uk/2019/07/24/publicly-funded-thats-solent-tv-moves-local-broadcasting-to-salisbury/|title=Publicly-funded That\u2019s Solent TV moves \u2018local\u2019 broadcasting to Salisbury|last=|first=|date=24 July 2019|website=Star & Crescent|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-16}}</ref> That\u2019s TV was allowed to operate from seven regional studios, as predicted by McEwan in his previous report.<ref name=\"will\" /> For example, That\u2019s Solent was now included within a \u201cSouth of England\u201d hub and would be broadcast from That\u2019s Salisbury\u2019s studio in Salisbury along with the stations for Basingstoke, Guildford, Oxford and Reading. All news shows from these stations were to be hosted by presenters in Salisbury. But McEwan\u2019s previous investigation revealed signs that That\u2019s Solent had already departed from the Solent area and started broadcasting from Salisbury months before Ofcom gave consent for the move. A former That\u2019s Solent journalist, who wished to remain anonymous, described the decision as a \u201cjoke\u201d. A source close to That\u2019s TV employees also claimed staff read about nationwide studio closures on news sites rather than being told by management.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nOfcom\u2019s letter of approval to That\u2019s TV said journalists would still be based in the local licensed areas but without physical premises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0027/155583/Local-TV-studio-locations.pdf|title=LDTPS licences consent to certain changes in the location of main production bases and/or studios|last=|first=|date=8 July 2019|website=Ofcom|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Ofcom explained That\u2019s TV\u2019s \"commitment for journalists and reporters to continue to collect, develop and record interviews on location within the licensed area\u2026\" Ofcom believed this meant that the \"local presence\" of stations like That\u2019s Solent would be \u201cmaintained\u201d. The regulator also stated, \"That\u2019s TV has confirmed that viewers of the services will not notice any difference in the content broadcast, with news items and interviews still recorded within the licensed area\u2026\" But sites like Star & Crescent previously watched That\u2019s Solent news bulletins that aired many stories from outside of the Solent area.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, the top story in one news bulletin was about Salisbury, with the show also featuring stories from Basingstoke, Newbury and Birmingham. A former employee of another That\u2019s TV station said Ofcom\u2019s claim that viewers would not notice any difference in news content \"completely misses the point\". They said, \"Out of a total of usually six to ten stories (completely depending on video times), three or four are filmed within the station location and the remaining are filmed out with, usually a completely different city. The news programmes [at this station] have always contained news stories from out with the licensed area. This is the same for all over the UK.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn December 2019, Star & Crescent published the following update to its story about the closure of 13 studios in That\u2019s TV\u2019s network of 20 licences<ref name=\":3\" />: That\u2019s TV chief executive Daniel Cass had previously told BBC News in July 2019: \u2018Does it make sense to be investing resources in 20 physical premises where you\u2019re tying up quite a lot of your reporters and journalists in administration and technical work rather than doing what we\u2019re doing going forward, which is freeing them up to spend significant time to be journalists?\u2019<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48939451|title=Local TV chain That's TV shuts 13 studios|date=2019-07-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> This comment referred to That\u2019s TV\u2019s premises across the UK, and implied that the company had, or at least wanted to have, premises for each of its 20 licences. The comment implied that the company, \u2018going forward\u2019, wanted to do something different compared to what it had been doing. In the interest of accuracy, Star & Crescent found evidence that this is a misleading comment from Cass. Former That\u2019s TV Scotland freelancers said there was a lack of premises in Scotland, meaning there were not \u201820 physical premises\u2019 for each of the 20 licences. Freelancers said there was only one studio in Scotland, which served all of the five Scottish licences. Freelancers also had to work from home or use WiFi in Costas and Starbucks, or Regus business lounges, in their local areas. This was because, out of the five Scottish licences, Glasgow was the only locality that had a permanent production office. Prior to Cass\u2019 comment to BBC News in July 2019, Ofcom had also confirmed in a freedom of information reply in April 2019 that it had no address details for either production offices or studios in the licensed areas of Aberdeen, Ayr, Dundee and Edinburgh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/145531/local-tv-additional-questions-foi.pdf|title=Local TV additional questions FOI|last=|first=|date=23 April 2019|website=Ofcom|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref>.
