Miller's gang\u2014his younger brother Ben, Jack Colby, and Jim Pierce\u2014await his arrival at the train station; it is clear that Miller intends to exact revenge.\n\n[[File:High Noon1.JPG|thumb|left|Will Kane and Amy Fowler meet in the Marshal's office]] For Amy, a devout [[Quaker]] and [[Pacifism|pacifist]], the solution is simple\u2014leave town before Miller arrives, but Kane's sense of duty and honor are strong.  \"They're making me run,\" he tells her.  \"I've never run from anybody before.\"  Besides, he says, Miller and his gang will hunt him down anyway.  Amy gives Kane an ultimatum: She is leaving on the noon train, with or without him.  While waiting at the hotel for the train, she meets Helen Ram\u00edrez, who was once Miller's lover, and then Kane's, and is leaving as well.  Amy understands why Helen is fleeing, but the reverse is not true: Helen tells Amy that if Kane were her man, she would not abandon him in his hour of need.\n\nKane's efforts to round up a posse at the tavern, and then the church, are met with fear and hostility.  Some townspeople, worried that a gunfight would damage the town's reputation, urge Kane to avoid the confrontation entirely.  Some are Miller's friends, and resent that Kane cleaned up the town in the first place. Some are of the opinion that their tax money goes to support local law enforcement and the fight is not a posse's responsibility.\n\nKane's young deputy Harvey Pell, who is bitter that Kane did not recommend him as his successor, says he will stand with Kane only if Kane goes to the city fathers and \"puts the word in\" for him.  Kane rejects the [[quid pro quo]], and Pell turns in his badge.  Kane visits a series of old friends and allies, but none can (or will) help: his predecessor, Marshal Howe is old and arthritic; Judge Percy Mettrick, who sentenced Miller, flees on horseback, and urges Kane to do the same; Herb Baker agrees to be deputized, but backs out when he realizes he is the only volunteer;  Sam Fuller hides in his house, sending his wife to the door to tell Kane he is not home. Jimmy is a good person and genuinely offers to help Will, but he is vision impaired, drunk and likely to get himself killed; Kane sends him home for his own safety. The other offer of aid comes from a fourteen-year-old boy; Kane admires his courage but rejects it as well.\n\nAt the stables, Pell saddles a horse and tries to persuade Kane to take it and leave town. Their conversation becomes an argument, and then a fist fight. Kane finally knocks his former deputy senseless, and returns to his office to write out his will as the clock ticks toward high noon. He then goes into the street to face Miller and his gang alone.  In one of the most iconic shots in film history, the [[crane shot]] widens to show Kane standing alone on a deserted street in a deserted town.\n\nThe gunfight begins.  Kane guns down Ben Miller and Colby, but is wounded in the process.  As the train is about to leave the station, Amy hears the gunfire, leaps off, and runs back to town.  Choosing her husband's life over her religious beliefs, she picks up the handgun hanging inside Kane's office and shoots Pierce from behind, leaving only Frank Miller, who grabs Amy as a shield to force Kane into the open. Amy claws Miller's face and he pushes her to the ground, giving Kane a clear shot, and he shoots Miller dead.\n\nKane helps his bride to her feet and they embrace.  As the townspeople emerge and cluster around him, Kane throws his marshal's star in the dirt, glares at the crowd, and departs with Amy on their wagon.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Gary Cooper in High Noon 1952.JPG|thumb|Gary Cooper as Marshal Will Kane]]\n[[File:GraceKellyHighNoonTrailerScreenshot1952.jpg|thumb|Grace Kelly as Amy Fowler Kane]]\n[[File:Katy Jurado in High Noon.png|thumb|upright|Katy Jurado as Helen Ram\u00edrez]]\n\n===Main cast===\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gary Cooper]] as Marshal [[Will Kane]]\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as Mayor Jonas Henderson\n* [[Lloyd Bridges]] as Deputy Marshal Harvey Pell\n* [[Katy Jurado]] as Helen Ram\u00edrez\n* [[Grace Kelly]] as Amy Fowler Kane\n* [[Otto Kruger]] as Judge Percy Mettrick\n* [[Lon Chaney Jr.|Lon Chaney]] as Martin Howe, the former marshal\n* [[Harry Morgan]] as Sam Fuller\n* [[Ian MacDonald (actor)|Ian MacDonald]] as Frank Miller\n* [[Eve McVeagh]] as Mildred Fuller\n* [[Morgan Farley]] as Dr. Mahin, minister\n* [[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]] as Cooper\n* [[Lee Van Cleef]] as Jack Colby\n* [[Robert J.

In 1951, during production of the film, [[Carl Foreman]] was called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) during its investigation of \"Communist propaganda and influence\" in the Hollywood motion picture industry. Foreman had once been a member of the [[Communist party]], but he declined to identify fellow members, or anyone he suspected of current membership. As a result, he was labeled an \"uncooperative witness\" by the committee, making him vulnerable to [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]].<ref name=\"Byman\">{{cite book |title=Showdown at High Noon: Witch-hunts, Critics, and the End of the Western |author=Byman, Jeremy |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8108-4998-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIp2PfC1Mm4C}}</ref> After his refusal to name names was made public, Foreman's production partner [[Stanley Kramer]] demanded an immediate dissolution of their partnership. As a signatory to the production loan, Foreman remained with the ''High Noon'' project; but before the film's release, he sold his partnership share to Kramer and moved to [[UK|Britain]], knowing that he would not find further work in the United States.<ref name=\"Byman\" />\n\nKramer later asserted that he ended their partnership because Foreman had threatened to falsely name him to HUAC as a Communist. Foreman said that Kramer feared damage to his own career due to \"guilt by association\". Foreman was indeed blacklisted by the Hollywood studios due to the \"uncooperative witness\" label and additional pressure from [[Columbia Pictures]] president [[Harry Cohn]], [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals|MPA]] president [[John Wayne]], and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gossip columnist [[Hedda Hopper]].<ref name=\"Byman\" />\n\nAccording to ''Darkness at High Noon: The Carl Foreman Documents''\u2014a 2002 documentary based in part on a lengthy 1952 letter from Foreman to film critic [[Bosley Crowther]]\u2014Foreman's role in the creation and production of ''High Noon'' has been unfairly downplayed over the years in favor of Kramer's. Foreman told Crowther that the film originated from a four-page plot outline he wrote that turned out to be very similar to a short story by [[John W. Cunningham]] called \"The Tin Star\". Foreman purchased the film rights to Cunningham's story and wrote the screenplay. By the time the documentary aired, most of the principals were dead, including Kramer, Foreman, Zinnemann, and Cooper. [[Victor Navasky]], author of ''Naming Names'', a definitive account of the Hollywood blacklist, told a reporter that, based on his interviews with Kramer's widow and others, the documentary seemed \"one-sided, and the problem is it makes a villain out of Stanley Kramer, when it was more complicated than that\".<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web|title='High Noon,' High Dudgeon|author=Weinraub, Bernard|work=The New York Times|date=April 18, 2002|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/18/movies/high-noon-high-dudgeon.html}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Fleischer]] later claimed he helped Carl Foreman develop the story of ''High Noon'' over eight weeks while driving to and from the set of ''[[The Clay Pigeon]]'' (1949) which they were making together.

Rumors of an affair between Cooper and Kelly during filming remain unsubstantiated.  Kelly biographer Donald Spoto wrote that there was no evidence of a romance, aside from tabloid gossip.<ref>Spoto, D. ''High Society: The Life of Grace Kelly''.

Kramer first offered him the Harvey Pell role, after seeing him in a touring production of ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]'', on the condition that he have his nose surgically altered to appear less menacing.

The opening scenes, under the [[Film credits|credits]], were shot at [[Iverson Movie Ranch]] near Los Angeles.  A few town scenes were shot in [[Columbia State Historic Park]], a preserved [[Gold Rush of 1849|Gold Rush]] mining town near [[Sonora, California|Sonora]], but most of the street scenes were filmed on the [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] Movie Ranch in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].  St. Joseph's Church in [[Tuolumne City, California|Tuolumne City]] was used for exterior shots of the Hadleyville church.  The railroad was the old [[Sierra Railroad]] in [[Jamestown, California|Jamestown]], a few miles south of Columbia, now known as [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]], and often nicknamed \"the movie railroad\" due to its frequent use in films and television shows. The railroad station was built for the film alongside a water tower at Warnerville, about 15 miles to the southwest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/h/highnoon.html |website=Movie-Locations.com|title=High Noon}}</ref>\n\nCooper was reluctant to film the fight scene with Bridges due to ongoing problems with his back, but did, without the use of a stunt double.

The plot, depicted in [[Real time (media)|real time]], centers on a town [[marshal]] who is torn between his sense of duty and his love for his new bride and who must face a gang of killers alone.\n\nThough mired in controversy with political overtones at the time of its release, the film was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] and won four (Actor, Editing, Music-Score, and Music-Song)<ref name=\"oscars\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1953|title=The 25th Academy Awards - 1953|website=oscars.org|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}</ref> as well as four [[Golden Globe Award]]s (Actor, Supporting Actress, Score, and Cinematography-Black and White).<ref name=\"globes\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044706/awards IMDB List] of nominations and awards for [[Stanley Kramer]]'s ''High Noon''.</ref> The award-winning score was written by Russian-born composer [[Dimitri Tiomkin]].\n\n''High Noon'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" in 1989, the NFR's first year of existence. An iconic film whose story has been partly or completely repeated in later film productions, its ending scenes especially inspired a next-to-endless number of later films, including but not just limited to westerns.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Hadleyville, a small town in [[New Mexico Territory]], Marshal [[Will Kane]], newly married to Amy Fowler, prepares to retire.  The happy couple will soon depart for a new life to raise a family and run a store in another town. However, word arrives that Frank Miller, a vicious outlaw whom Kane sent to jail, has been released and will arrive on the noon train.  Miller's gang\u2014his younger brother Ben, Jack Colby, and Jim Pierce\u2014await his arrival at the train station; it is clear that Miller intends to exact revenge.\n\n[[File:High Noon1.JPG|thumb|left|Will Kane and Amy Fowler meet in the Marshal's office]] For Amy, a devout [[Quaker]] and [[Pacifism|pacifist]], the solution is simple\u2014leave town before Miller arrives, but Kane's sense of duty and honor are strong.  \"They're making me run,\" he tells her.  \"I've never run from anybody before.\"  Besides, he says, Miller and his gang will hunt him down anyway.  Amy gives Kane an ultimatum: She is leaving on the noon train, with or without him.  While waiting at the hotel for the train, she meets Helen Ram\u00edrez, who was once Miller's lover, and then Kane's, and is leaving as well.  Amy understands why Helen is fleeing, but the reverse is not true: Helen tells Amy that if Kane were her man, she would not abandon him in his hour of need.\n\nKane's efforts to round up a posse at the tavern, and then the church, are met with fear and hostility.  Some townspeople, worried that a gunfight would damage the town's reputation, urge Kane to avoid the confrontation entirely.  Some are Miller's friends, and resent that Kane cleaned up the town in the first place. Some are of the opinion that their tax money goes to support local law enforcement and the fight is not a posse's responsibility. \n\nKane's young deputy Harvey Pell, who is bitter that Kane did not recommend him as his successor, says he will stand with Kane only if Kane goes to the city fathers and \"puts the word in\" for him.  Kane rejects the [[quid pro quo]], and Pell turns in his badge.  Kane visits a series of old friends and allies, but none can (or will) help: his predecessor, Marshal Howe is old and arthritic; Judge Percy Mettrick, who sentenced Miller, flees on horseback, and urges Kane to do the same; Herb Baker agrees to be deputized, but backs out when he realizes he is the only volunteer;  Sam Fuller hides in his house, sending his wife to the door to tell Kane he is not home. Jimmy is a good person and genuinely offers to help Will, but he is vision impaired, drunk and likely to get himself killed; Kane sends him home for his own safety. The other offer of aid comes from a fourteen-year-old boy; Kane admires his courage but rejects it as well.\n\nAt the stables, Pell saddles a horse and tries to persuade Kane to take it and leave town. Their conversation becomes an argument, and then a fist fight. Kane finally knocks his former deputy senseless, and returns to his office to write out his will as the clock ticks toward high noon. He then goes into the street to face Miller and his gang alone.  In one of the most iconic shots in film history, the [[crane shot]] widens to show Kane standing alone on a deserted street in a deserted town.\n\nThe gunfight begins.  Kane guns down Ben Miller and Colby, but is wounded in the process.  As the train is about to leave the station, Amy hears the gunfire, leaps off, and runs back to town.  Choosing her husband's life over her religious beliefs, she picks up the handgun hanging inside Kane's office and shoots Pierce from behind, leaving only Frank Miller, who grabs Amy as a shield to force Kane into the open. Amy claws Miller's face and he pushes her to the ground, giving Kane a clear shot, and he shoots Miller dead.\n\nKane helps his bride to her feet and they embrace.  As the townspeople emerge and cluster around him, Kane throws his marshal's star in the dirt, glares at the crowd, and departs with Amy on their wagon.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Gary Cooper in High Noon 1952.JPG|thumb|Gary Cooper as Marshal Will Kane]]\n[[File:GraceKellyHighNoonTrailerScreenshot1952.jpg|thumb|Grace Kelly as Amy Fowler Kane]]\n[[File:Katy Jurado in High Noon.png|thumb|upright|Katy Jurado as Helen Ram\u00edrez]]\n===Main cast===\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gary Cooper]] as Marshal [[Will Kane]]\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as Mayor Jonas Henderson\n* [[Lloyd Bridges]] as Deputy Marshal Harvey Pell\n* [[Katy Jurado]] as Helen Ram\u00edrez\n* [[Grace Kelly]] as Amy Fowler Kane\n* [[Otto Kruger]] as Judge Percy Mettrick\n* [[Lon Chaney Jr.|Lon Chaney]] as Martin Howe, the former marshal\n* [[Harry Morgan]] as Sam Fuller\n* [[Ian MacDonald (actor)|Ian MacDonald]] as Frank Miller\n* [[Eve McVeagh]] as Mildred Fuller\n* [[Morgan Farley]] as Dr. Mahin, minister\n* [[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]] as Cooper\n* [[Lee Van Cleef]] as Jack Colby\n* [[Robert J.

In 1951, during production of the film, [[Carl Foreman]] was called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) during its investigation of \"Communist propaganda and influence\" in the Hollywood motion picture industry. Foreman had once been a member of the [[Communist party]], but he declined to identify fellow members, or anyone he suspected of current membership. As a result, he was labeled an \"uncooperative witness\" by the committee, making him vulnerable to [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]].<ref name=\"Byman\">{{cite book |title=Showdown at High Noon: Witch-hunts, Critics, and the End of the Western |author=Byman, Jeremy |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8108-4998-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIp2PfC1Mm4C}}</ref> After his refusal to name names was made public, Foreman's production partner [[Stanley Kramer]] demanded an immediate dissolution of their partnership. As a signatory to the production loan, Foreman remained with the ''High Noon'' project; but before the film's release, he sold his partnership share to Kramer and moved to [[UK|Britain]], knowing that he would not find further work in the United States.<ref name=\"Byman\" />\n\nKramer later asserted that he ended their partnership because Foreman had threatened to falsely name him to HUAC as a Communist. Foreman said that Kramer feared damage to his own career due to \"guilt by association\". Foreman was indeed blacklisted by the Hollywood studios due to the \"uncooperative witness\" label and additional pressure from [[Columbia Pictures]] president [[Harry Cohn]], [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals|MPA]] president [[John Wayne]], and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gossip columnist [[Hedda Hopper]].<ref name=\"Byman\" />\n\nAccording to ''Darkness at High Noon: The Carl Foreman Documents''\u2014a 2002 documentary based in part on a lengthy 1952 letter from Foreman to film critic [[Bosley Crowther]]\u2014Foreman's role in the creation and production of ''High Noon'' has been unfairly downplayed over the years in favor of Kramer's. Foreman told Crowther that the film originated from a four-page plot outline he wrote that turned out to be very similar to a short story by [[John W. Cunningham]] called \"The Tin Star\". Foreman purchased the film rights to Cunningham's story and wrote the screenplay. By the time the documentary aired, most of the principals were dead, including Kramer, Foreman, Zinnemann, and Cooper. [[Victor Navasky]], author of ''Naming Names'', a definitive account of the Hollywood blacklist, told a reporter that, based on his interviews with Kramer's widow and others, the documentary seemed \"one-sided, and the problem is it makes a villain out of Stanley Kramer, when it was more complicated than that\".<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web|title='High Noon,' High Dudgeon|author=Weinraub, Bernard|work=The New York Times|date=April 18, 2002|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/18/movies/high-noon-high-dudgeon.html}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Fleischer]] later claimed he helped Carl Foreman develop the story of ''High Noon'' over eight weeks while driving to and from the set of ''[[The Clay Pigeon]]'' (1949) which they were making together. Fleischer says his RKO contract prevented him from directing ''High Noon''.<ref name=\"richard\">{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Fleischer|title=Just Tell Me When to Cry: A Memoir|year=1993|publisher=Carroll and Graf|pages=35\u201336}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[John Wayne]] was originally offered the lead role in the film, but turned it down because he felt that Foreman's story was an obvious allegory against [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]], which he actively supported. Later, he told an interviewer that he would \"never regret having helped run Foreman out of the country\".<ref>[https://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/Wild_Wild_Cold_War/files/2011/11/John_Wayne_Playboy_Int2.pdf John Wayne: ''Playboy'' Interview / MAY 1971].

Although Wayne's contempt for the film and refusal of its lead role were well known, he said, \"I'm glad to see they're giving this to a man who is not only most deserving, but has conducted himself throughout the years in our business in a manner that we can all be proud of ... Now that I'm through being such a good sport ... I'm going back and find my business manager and agent ... and find out why I didn't get ''High Noon'' instead of Cooper ...\"<ref name=\"TCM\">[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/24083/High-Noon/articles.html ''High Noon''], retrieved September 11, 2016.</ref>\n\nAfter Wayne turned down the Will Kane role, Kramer offered it to [[Gregory Peck]], who declined because he felt it was too similar to his role in ''[[The Gunfighter]]'', the year before.  He later said he considered it the biggest mistake of his career.<ref>[http://www.destinationhollywood.com/celebrities/gregorypeck/funfeatures_content.shtml Gregory Peck], retrieved September 6, 2016.</ref> [[Marlon Brando]], [[Montgomery Clift]], and [[Charlton Heston]] also declined the role.<ref name=\"TCM\"/>\n\nKramer saw [[Grace Kelly]] in an off-Broadway play and cast her as Kane's bride, despite Cooper and Kelly's substantial age disparity (50 and 21, respectively).  Rumors of an affair between Cooper and Kelly during filming remain unsubstantiated.  Kelly biographer Donald Spoto wrote that there was no evidence of a romance, aside from tabloid gossip.<ref>Spoto, D. ''High Society: The Life of Grace Kelly''. Crown Archetype (2009), pp. 67\u20139. {{ISBN|0307395618}}</ref> Biographer Gina McKinnon speculated that \"there might well have been a roll or two in the hay bales\", but cited no evidence, other than a remark by Kelly's sister Lizanne that Kelly was \"infatuated\" with Cooper.<ref>McKinnon, G.

Kramer first offered him the Harvey Pell role, after seeing him in a touring production of ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]'', on the condition that he have his nose surgically altered to appear less menacing. Van Cleef refused, and was cast instead as Colby, the only role of his career without a single line of dialog.<ref>[http://www.westernclippings.com/heavies/leevancleef_charactersheavies.shtml Lee Van Cleef], retrieved September 6, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n''High Noon'' was filmed in the late summer/early fall of 1951 in several locations in California. The opening scenes, under the [[Film credits|credits]], were shot at [[Iverson Movie Ranch]] near Los Angeles.  A few town scenes were shot in [[Columbia State Historic Park]], a preserved [[Gold Rush of 1849|Gold Rush]] mining town near [[Sonora, California|Sonora]], but most of the street scenes were filmed on the [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] Movie Ranch in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].  St. Joseph's Church in [[Tuolumne City, California|Tuolumne City]] was used for exterior shots of the Hadleyville church.  The railroad was the old [[Sierra Railroad]] in [[Jamestown, California|Jamestown]], a few miles south of Columbia, now known as [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]], and often nicknamed \"the movie railroad\" due to its frequent use in films and television shows. The railroad station was built for the film alongside a water tower at Warnerville, about 15 miles to the southwest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/h/highnoon.html |website=Movie-Locations.com|title=High Noon}}</ref>\n\nCooper was reluctant to film the fight scene with Bridges due to ongoing problems with his back, but did, without the use of a stunt double.  He wore no makeup, to emphasize his character's anguish and fear, which was probably intensified by pain from recent surgery to remove a bleeding [[Gastric ulcer|ulcer]].<ref>Hyams, J.

The poster, which was displayed all over Poland, shows Cooper armed with a folded ballot saying \"Wybory\" (i.e., elections) in his right hand while the [[Solidarity logo]] is pinned to his vest above the sheriff's badge. The message at the bottom of the poster reads: \"W samo po\u0142udnie: 4 czerwca 1989,\" which translates to \"High Noon: 4 June 1989.\"\n\nAs former Solidarity leader [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] wrote, in 2004,\n\n{{quote|Under the headline \"At High Noon\" runs the red Solidarity banner and the date\u2014June 4, 1989\u2014of the poll.

Cowboys fight for justice, fight against evil, and fight for freedom, both physical and spiritual.

The musical was revived at the [[Lucille Lortel Theatre]] in New York, directed by [[Stafford Arima]] from January until April 2012. On September 25, 2012, the first official cast recording was released. The new production is currently available to license for professional and amateur productions from Rodgers & Hammerstein Theatricals.\n*1990: ''Ghost Stories'' was an adaptation of Stephen King's short stories \"The Return of Timmy Baterman,\" about zombies; \"[[Strawberry Spring]],\" about a campus serial killer; \"[[Gray Matter (short story)|Gray Matter]],\" a black comedy about a hideous mutation caused by a bottle of beer; \"[[Uncle Otto's Truck]],\" and \"[[The Boogeyman (short story)|The Boogeyman]],\" about a distraught father's encounter with a child-killing closet monster, as well as selections from ''[[Pet Sematary]]''. Adapted and directed by Robert Pridham, the play premiered at the Arts Center Theatre at [[Kent Place School]] in Summit, New Jersey, and toured the United States in the mid-1990s.\n*1993: ''[[Rage (Stephen King novel)|Rage]]'' stage play produced by [[Shane Black]] and directed by Jim Birge. Originally titled ''Getting It On'', it was intended to premiere in [[Jasper, Indiana]], but scheduling and venue issues forced it to move to the [[VFW]] in [[Santa Claus, Indiana]], where it ran from April 23 to May 1. Venue problems caused the final show, on May 2, to be canceled.\n*2005: ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'' stage play by [[Simon Moore (writer)|Simon Moore]] based on 1987 novel.

The first practical transmissions of moving images over a radio system used mechanical rotating perforated disks to scan a scene into a time-varying signal that could be reconstructed at a receiver back into an approximation of the original image. Development of television was interrupted by the Second World War.  After the end of the war, all-electronic methods of scanning and displaying images became standard. Several different standards for addition of color to transmitted images were developed, with different regions using technically incompatible signal standards. \nTelevision broadcasting expanded rapidly after World War II, becoming an important [[mass media|mass medium]] for advertising, propaganda, and entertainment. <ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.nyu.edu/classes/stephens/History%20of%20Television%20page.htm|title = History of Television|date = February 6, 2015|accessdate = February 6, 2015|website = www.nyu.edu|publisher = New York University |last = Stephens|first = Mitchell}}</ref> \n \t\nTelevision broadcasts can be distributed over the air by VHF and UHF radio signals from terrestrial transmitting stations, by [[microwave]] signals from Earth orbiting satellites, or by wired transmission to individual consumers by [[cable TV]]. Many countries have moved away from the original analog radio transmission methods and now use [[digital television]] standards, providing additional operating features and conserving radio spectrum bandwidth for more profitable uses. Television programming can also be distributed over the Internet. \n\nTelevision broadcasting may be funded by advertising revenue, by private or governmental organizations prepared to underwrite the cost, or in some countries, by television license fees paid by owners of receivers. Some services, especially carried by cable or satellite, are paid by subscriptions. \n\t\nTelevision broadcasting is supported by continuing technical developments such as long-haul microwave networks, which allow distribution of programming over a wide geographic area. Video recording methods allow programming to be edited and replayed for later use. Three-dimensional television has been used commercially but has not received wide consumer acceptance owing to the limitations of display methods.\n\n==Mechanical television==\n{{main|Mechanical television}}\n\n[[Facsimile transmission]] systems pioneered methods of mechanically scanning graphics in the early 19th century.

He created his prototype in a little village called Santa Cruz on the island of Trinidad where he was recovering from an illness. He also started work on the first color television. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised [[silhouette]] images in motion, at [[Selfridges|Selfridge's]] Department Store in London.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/115504a0|title=Current Topics and Events|journal=Nature|volume=115|issue=2892|pages=504\u2013508|year=1925|bibcode=1925Natur.115..504.|doi-access=free}}</ref> Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a talking, moving ventriloquist's dummy named \"Stooky Bill\", whose painted face had higher contrast. By January 26, 1926, he had demonstrated the transmission of an image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration in history.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light that swept across the subject. A selenium [[Phototube|photoelectric tube]] detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one [[scan line]] of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face.\n\nIn 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over {{convert|438|mi|km}} of telephone line between London and [[Glasgow]]. In 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and [[Bernard Natan]] of [[Path\u00e9]] established France's first television company, T\u00e9l\u00e9vision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]].<ref>J. L. Baird, \"[http://www.bairdtelevision.com/1932.html Television in 1932]\", ''BBC Annual Report'', 1933.</ref> In 1932, he demonstrated [[ultra-short wave]] television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240 lines of resolution on [[BBC]] television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead, a [[17.5mm film]] was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet.\n\nAn American inventor, [[Charles Francis Jenkins]], also pioneered the television. He published an article on \"Motion Pictures by Wireless\" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses. On June 13, 1925, Jenkins publicly demonstrated the synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925, Jenkins used a [[Nipkow disk]] and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles (from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C.), using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution.<ref>\"Radio Shows Far Away Objects in Motion\", ''The New York Times'', June 14, 1925, p. 1.</ref><ref name=\"glinsky\">{{cite book| last = Glinsky| first = Albert| title = Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage| location = Urbana, Illinois| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2000| pages = [https://archive.org/details/thereminethermus00glin/page/41 41]\u201345| isbn = 978-0-252-02582-2| url = https://archive.org/details/thereminethermus00glin| url-access = registration}}</ref> He was granted U.S. patent 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on June 30, 1925 (filed March 13, 1922).\n\nOn December 25, 1925, [[Kenjiro Takayanagi]] demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan.

Ives]] and [[Frank Gray (researcher)|Frank Gray]] of [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on April 7, 1927. The reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a two-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen. The large receiver had a screen 24&nbsp;inches wide by 30&nbsp;inches high. Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets also received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a [[copper wire]] link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from [[Whippany, New Jersey]]. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]]. A [[flying-spot scanner]] beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 [[millisecond]]s. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: \"It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality.\"<ref>Abramson, Albert, ''The History of Television, 1880 to 1941'', McFarland & Co., Inc., 1987, p. 101. {{ISBN|978-0-89950-284-7}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1928, [[WRGB]] (then W2XB) was started as the world's first television station.

It was popularly known as \"[[WGY (AM)|WGY]] Television\".\n\nMeanwhile, in the [[Soviet Union]], [[L\u00e9on Theremin]] had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16-line resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using [[Interlaced video|interlacing]] in 1926. As part of his thesis on May 7, 1926, Theremin electrically transmitted and then projected near-simultaneous moving images on a five-foot square screen.<ref name=\"glinsky\"/> By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until 1931 by RCA, with 120 lines.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nBecause only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution in mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to about 120. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear.<ref>Donald F.

Among other things, he had devised a miniature refrigerator for cars and a new rotary engine design. Intrigued by television, he decided to apply his technical skills to the new medium. At the time, the biggest challenge in television technology was to transmit images with sufficient resolution to reproduce recognizable figures. As recounted by media historian Melita Zajc, most inventors were determined to increase the number of lines used by their systems \u2013 some were approaching what was then the magic number of 100 lines. But Baron Codelli had a different idea. In 1929, he developed a television device with a single line \u2013 but one that formed a continuous spiral on the screen. Codelli based his ingenious design on his understanding of the human eye. He knew that objects seen in peripheral vision don't need to be as sharp as those in the center. The baron's mechanical television system, whose image was sharpest in the middle, worked well, and he was soon able to transmit images of his wife, Ilona von Drasche-Lazar, over the air.\nDespite the backing of the German electronics giant Telefunken, however, Codelli's television system never became a commercial reality. Electronic television ultimately emerged as the dominant system, and Codelli moved on to other projects. His invention was largely forgotten.\n<ref>Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940, page 192, article 1898, Anton Codelli</ref>\n<ref>Culture.si: http://www.culture.si/en/Radio-Television_Slovenia_(RTV_Slovenia), The first known transmitted TV image on the territory of Slovenia</ref>\n<ref>[[:sl:Anton Codelli (izumitelj)]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe advancement of all-electronic television (including [[Video camera tube#Image dissector|image dissector]]s and other camera tubes and [[cathode ray tube]]s for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television.

In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disc. This device was very \"deep\", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html|title=The World's First High Definition Colour Television System|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref> However, Baird was not happy with the design, and as early as 1944 had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.\n\nMexican inventor [[Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez Camarena]] also played an important role in early TV.

The [[War Production Board]] halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from April 22, 1942, to August 20, 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.<ref>\"Making of Radios and Phonographs to End April 22,\" ''The New York Times'', March 8, 1942, p. 1. \"Radio Production Curbs Cover All Combinations,\" ''Wall Street Journal'', June 3, 1942, p. 4. \"WPB Cancels 210 Controls; Radios, Trucks in Full Output,\" ''The New York Times'', August 21, 1945, p. 1.</ref><ref>Bob Cooper, \"[http://www.earlytelevision.org/color_tv_cooper.html Television: The Technology That Changed Our Lives]\", Early Television Foundation.</ref>\n\nAs early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called the \"[[Telechrome]]\". Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called \"stereoscopic\" at the time). A demonstration on August 16, 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. This used a patterned version of the phosphor plate, with the guns aimed at ridges on one side of the plate. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.<ref>Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland & Company, 2003, pp. 13\u201314. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}</ref><ref>Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System].</ref>\n\nSimilar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The [[Geer tube]] was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The [[Penetron]] used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The [[Chromatron]] used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.\n\nOne of the great technical challenges of introducing color [[broadcast television]] was the desire to conserve [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], potentially three times that of the existing [[black-and-white]] standards, and not use an excessive amount of [[radio spectrum]]. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee<ref name=name>National Television System Committee (1951\u20131953), [Report and Reports of Panel No. 11, 11-A, 12\u201319, with Some supplementary references cited in the Reports, and the Petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the Federal Communications Commission, n.p., 1953], 17 v. illus., diagrams., tables. 28 cm. LC Control No.:54021386 [http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First Library of Congress Online Catalog]</ref> approved an all-electronic [[Compatible color]] system developed by [[RCA]], which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The [[NTSC]] standard represented a major technical achievement.\n\n[[File:SMPTE Color Bars.svg|thumb|left|Color bars used in a [[test pattern]], sometimes used when no program material is available.]]\nAlthough all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953,<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G.|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7rWFRLVyvY0C&pg=PA290&dq=color+television+December+17+1953#v=onepage&q=color%20television%20December%2017%201953&f=false |year=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9781410614742 |page=290}}</ref> high prices and the scarcity of color programming greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]) occurred on January 1, 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.\n\nEarly color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy, so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of [[General Electric|GE's]] relatively compact and lightweight [[Porta-Color]] set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets.\n\nColor broadcasting in Europe was also not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color, and by the early 1980s black-and-white sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or use as [[video monitor]] screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s even these areas switched to color sets.\n\n==Digital television==\n{{main|Digital television}}\n{{see also|Digital television transition}}\n\nDigital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signal, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by [[analog television]].

It wasn't until the 1990s that digital TV became a real possibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benton.org/initiatives/obligations/charting_the_digital_broadcasting_future/sec1|title=The Origins and Future Prospects of Digital Television|accessdate=December 11, 2015|date=December 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s Japanese consumer electronics firm [[Sony Corporation]] developed HDTV technology and the [[Sony HDVS|equipment to record at such resolution]], and the [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]] analog format proposed by [[NHK]], a Japanese broadcaster, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies. Sony's system produced images at 1125-line resolution (or in digital terms, 1875x1125, close to the resolution of Full HD video<ref>1125 divided by 3, and then multiplied by 5, due to the 5:3 aspect ratio, asumming square pixels</ref>) Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard\u2014based on an analog system\u2014was the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the FCC was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.\n\nIn March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images.(7) Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being \"simulcast\" on different channels.(8)The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing NTSC standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.\n\nThe final standard adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution. This outcome resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes\u2014interlaced or progressive\u2014is superior. Interlaced scanning, which is used in televisions worldwide, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. Progressive scanning, which is the format used in computers, scans lines in sequences, from top to bottom. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not \"flicker\" in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offers a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then feasible, that is, 1080 lines per picture and 1920 pixels per line. William F. Schreiber, who was a director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemasource.com/articles/hist_politics_dtv.pdf|title=The history and politics of DTV|page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[Digital television transition]] started in the late 2000s. All the governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by the 2010s. Initially the adoption rate was low. But soon, more and more households were converting to digital televisions. The transition is expected to be completed worldwide by mid to late 2010s.\n\n==Smart television==\n{{main|Smart television}}\n{{Distinguish|Internet television|Internet Protocol television|Web television}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2014}}\n\nAdvent of digital television allowed innovations like smart TVs. A smart television, sometimes referred to as ''connected TV'' or ''hybrid television'', is a television set with integrated Internet and [[Web 2.0]] features, and is an example of [[technological convergence]] between computers and television sets and set-top boxes.  Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional [[Broadcasting|broadcasting media]], these devices can also provide Internet TV, online [[interactive media]], [[over-the-top content]], as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and [[home network]]ing access.

At first, [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial broadcasting]] was the only way television could be widely distributed, and because [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was limited, i.e., there were only a small number of [[Television channel|channels]] available, government regulation was the norm.\n\n=== Canada ===\nThe [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) adopted the American NTSC 525-line B/W 60 field per second system as its broadcast standard. It began television broadcasting in Canada in September 1952. The first broadcast was on September 6, 1952 from its [[Montreal]] station [[CBFT]]. The premiere broadcast was bilingual, spoken in English and French. Two days later, on September 8, 1952, the [[Toronto]] station [[CBLT (TV)|CBLT]] went on the air. This became the English-speaking flagship station for the country, while CBFT became the French-language flagship after a second English-language station was licensed to CBC in Montreal later in the decade. The CBC's first privately owned affiliate television station, [[CICI-TV|CKSO]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, Ontario]], launched in October 1953 (at the time, all private stations were expected to affiliate with the CBC, a condition that was relaxed in 1960\u201361 when CTV, Canada's second national English-language network, was formed).\n\n=== Czechoslovakia ===\n[[File:H\u00f6ritz Museum - Fernseher Tesla 40001A.jpg|thumb|The first mass-produced Czechoslovak TV-set Tesla 4001A (1953-57).]]\nIn former [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]]) the first experimental [[television set]]s were produced in 1948. In the same year the first TV- transmission was performed. The first regular TV public transmission started on May 1, 1953. The state-owned TV-centers were in [[Prague]], [[Bratislava]], [[Brno]] and [[Ostrava]]. In 1961 more than a million citizens had a television set. In 1970, Czechoslovak television had three channels: Czech, Slovak and a bilingual Federal Channel. In 1973, color broadcasting started.\n\n=== France ===\nThe first experiments in television broadcasting began in France in the 1930s, although the French did not immediately employ the new technology.\n\nIn November 1929, Bernard Natan established France's first television company, T\u00e9l\u00e9vision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. On April 14, 1931, there took place the first transmission with a thirty-line standard by Ren\u00e9 Barth\u00e9lemy. On December 6, 1931, [[Henri de France]] created the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de T\u00e9l\u00e9vision (CGT). In December 1932, Barth\u00e9lemy carried out an experimental program in black and white (definition: 60 lines) one hour per week, \"Paris T\u00e9l\u00e9vision\", which gradually became daily from early 1933.\n\nThe first official channel of French television appeared on February 13, 1935, the date of the official inauguration of television in France, which was broadcast in 60 lines from 8:15 to 8:30 pm. The program showed the actress B\u00e9atrice Bretty in the studio of Radio-PTT Vision at 103 rue de Grenelle in Paris. The broadcast had a range of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}. On November 10, [[George Mandel]], Minister of Posts, inaugurated the first broadcast in 180 lines from the transmitter of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. On the 18th, Susy Wincker, the first announcer since the previous June, carried out a demonstration for the press from 5:30 to 7:30 pm. Broadcasts became regular from January 4, 1937 from 11:00 to 11:30 am and 8:00 to 8:30 pm during the week, and from 5:30 to 7:30 pm on Sundays. In July 1938, a decree defined for three years a standard of 455 lines VHF (whereas three standards were used for the experiments: 441 lines for Gramont, 450 lines for the Compagnie des Compteurs and 455 for Thomson). In 1939, there were about only 200 to 300 individual television sets, some of which were also available in a few public places.\n\nWith the entry of France into World War II the same year, broadcasts ceased and the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was sabotaged. On September 3, 1940, French television was seized by the German occupation forces. A technical agreement was signed by the Compagnie des Compteurs and [[Telefunken]], and a financing agreement for the resuming of the service is signed by German Ministry of Post and Radiodiffusion Nationale ([[Vichy France|Vichy]]'s radio). On May 7, 1943 at 3:00 evening broadcasts. The first broadcast of [[Fernsehsender Paris]] (Paris T\u00e9l\u00e9vision) was transmitted from rue Cognac-Jay. These regular broadcasts (5{{fraction|1|4}} hours a day) lasted until August 16, 1944. One thousand 441-line sets, most of which were installed in soldiers' hospitals, picked up the broadcasts. These Nazi-controlled television broadcasts from the Eiffel Tower in Paris were able to be received on the south coast of England by R.A.F. and BBC engineers,<ref>http://www.earlytelevision.org/raf.html ''R.A.F. Reception of German TV from Paris'', retrieved 2013 April 23</ref> who photographed the station identification image direct from the screen.\n\nIn 1944, Ren\u00e9 Barth\u00e9lemy developed an [[819-line]] television standard. During the years of occupation, Barth\u00e9lemy reached 1015 and even 1042 lines. On October 1, 1944, television service resumed after the [[liberation of Paris]]. The broadcasts were transmitted from the Cognacq-Jay studios. In October 1945, after repairs, the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was back in service. On November 20, 1948, [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] decreed a broadcast standard of 819 lines; broadcasting began at the end of 1949 in this definition. Besides France, this standard was later adopted by Algeria, Monaco, and Morocco. Belgium and Luxembourg used a modified version of this standard with bandwidth narrowed to 7&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=\"britbroadcasttrans\">{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=jKjoU8bokw0C&pg=PA227&lpg=PA227&dq=819+lines+television+france+belgium+denmark#v=onepage&q=819%20lines%20television%20france%20belgium%20denmark&f=false|title = British Broadcasting in Transition|author = Burton Paulu |isbn = 9781452909554|year = 1961}}</ref>\n\n=== Germany ===\nElectromechanical broadcasts began in Germany in 1929, but were without sound until 1934. Network electronic service started on March 22, 1935, on [[180 lines]] using [[telecine]] transmission of film, [[intermediate film system]], or cameras using the Nipkow Disk. Transmissions using cameras based on the [[iconoscope]] began on January 15, 1936. The Berlin [[1936 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] were televised, using both all-electronic iconoscope-based cameras and intermediate film cameras, to Berlin and [[Hamburg]] in August 1936. Twenty-eight public television rooms were opened for anybody who did not own a television set. The Germans had a 441-line system on the air in February 1937, and during [[World War II]] brought it to France, where they broadcast from the Eiffel Tower.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the victorious Allies imposed a general ban on all radio and television broadcasting in Germany. Radio broadcasts for information purposes were soon permitted again, but television broadcasting was allowed to resume only in 1948.\n\nIn East Germany, the head of broadcasting in the Soviet occupation zone, Hans Mahler, predicted in 1948 that in the near future \u2018a new and important technical step forward in the field of broadcasting in Germany will begin its triumphant march: television.\u2019  In 1950, the plans for a nationwide television service got off the ground, and a Television Centre in Berlin was approved. Transmissions began on December 21, 1952 using the 625-line standard developed in the Soviet Union in 1944, although at that time there were probably no more than 75 television receivers capable of receiving the programming.<ref>[http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/socialsciences/screening-socialism/television-histories/tvinthegdr/ \"TV in the GDR\"], ''Loughborough University''</ref><ref>[http://www.dra.de/online/hinweisdienste/kurzinformationen/70jahre-fs.pdf \"Fernsehen aus Adlershof\"], ''Deutsches Rundfunkarchiv Babelsberg''</ref>\n\nIn West Germany, the British occupation forces as well as [[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk|NWDR]] (Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk), which had started work in the British zone straight after the war, agreed to the launch of a television station. Even before this, German television specialists had agreed on 625 lines as the future standard.<ref>[https://www.ebu.ch/CMSimages/en/dossiers_1_04_eurovision50_ve_tcm6-13890.pdf \"50 years of Eurovision\"], ''EBU'', January, 2004.</ref> This standard had narrower channel bandwidth (7&nbsp;MHz) compared to the Soviet specification (8&nbsp;MHz), allowing three television channels to fit into the [[Band I|VHF I]] band.\n\nWhen color was introduced, West Germany chose a variant of the [[NTSC]] color system, modified by [[Walter Bruch]] and called [[PAL]]. East Germany accepted the French [[SECAM]] system, which was used in Eastern European countries. With the reunification of Germany, it was decided to switch to the PAL color system. The system was changed in December 1990.\n\n=== Italy ===\nIn Italy, the first experimental tests on television broadcasts were made in [[Turin]] since 1934. The city already hosted the Center for Management of the [[Ente Italiano per le Audizioni Radiofoniche|EIAR]] (lately renamed as [[RAI]]) at the premises of the Theatre of Turin. Subsequently, the EAIR established offices in [[Rome]] and [[Milan]].\nOn July 22, 1939 comes into operation in Rome the first television transmitter at the EIAR station, which performed a regular broadcast for about a year using a 441-line system that was developed in Germany. In September of the same year, a second television transmitter was installed in Milan, making experimental broadcasts during major events in the city.\n\nThe broadcasts were suddenly ended on May 31, 1940, by order of the government, allegedly because of interferences encountered in the first air navigation systems. Also, the imminent participation in the war is believed to have played a role in this decision. EIAR transmitting equipment was relocated to Germany by the German troops. Lately, it was returned to Italy.\n\nThe first official television broadcast began on January 3, 1954 by the RAI.\n\n=== Japan ===\nTelevision broadcasting in Japan started in August 28, 1953,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p07/column/index1.html |title=\"Can you see me clearly?\" Public TV image reception experiment (1939) |publisher=NHK |date=1939-05-13 |accessdate=2012-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101044401/http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p07/column/index1.html |archivedate=January 1, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> making the country one of the first in the world with an experimental television service.

The HDVS range was launched in April 1984, with the HDC-100 camera, HDV-100 video recorder and HDS-100 [[video switcher]] all working in the 1125-line [[component video]] format with [[interlaced video]] and a 5:3 aspect ratio.\n\n=== Mexico ===\nThe first testing television station in Mexico signed on in 1935. When [[KFMB-TV]] in [[San Diego]] signed on in 1949, [[Baja California]] became the first state to receive a commercial television station over the air. Within a year, the Mexican government would adopt the U.S. NTSC 525-line B/W 60-field-per-second system as the country's broadcast standard. In 1950, the first commercial television station within Mexico, [[XHTV]] in Mexico City, signed on the air, followed by [[XEW-TV]] in 1951 and [[XHGC]] in 1952. Those three were not only the first television stations in the country, but also the flagship stations of [[Telesistema Mexicano]], which was formed in 1955. That year, [[Emilio Azc\u00e1rraga Vidaurreta]], who had signed on XEW-TV, entered into a partnership with [[R\u00f3mulo O'Farrill]] who had signed on XHTV, and [[Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez Camarena]], who had signed on XHGC. The earliest [[3D television]] broadcasts in the world were broadcast over XHGC in 1954. Color television was introduced in 1962, also over XHGC-TV. One of Telesistema Mexicano's earliest broadcasts as a network, over XEW-TV, on June 25, 1955, was the first international North American broadcast in the medium's history, and was jointly aired with NBC in the United States, where it aired as the premiere episode of ''[[Wide Wide World]],'' and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  Except for a brief period between 1969\u20131973, nearly every commercial television station in Mexico, with exceptions in the border cities, was expected to affiliate with a subnetwork of Telesistema Mexicano or its successor, [[Televisa]] (formed by the 1973 merger of Telesistema Mexicano and [[Television Independiente de Mexico]]). This condition would not be relaxed for good until 1993, when Imevision was privatized to become [[TV Azteca]].\n\n=== Soviet Union (USSR) ===\nThe Soviet Union began offering 30-line electromechanical test broadcasts in Moscow on October 31, 1931, and a commercially manufactured television set in 1932.\n\nFirst electronic television system on 180 lines at 25 fps was created in the beginning of 1935 in Leningrad (St. Petersburg). In September 1937 the experimental Leningrad TV Center (OLTC) was put in action.

Regular broadcasting began on December 31, 1938. It was quickly realized that 343 lines of resolution offered by this format would have become insufficient in the long run, thus a specification for 441-line format at 25 fps interlaced was developed in 1940.<ref name=\"Raspletin_100years_RussianTV\"/>\n\nTelevision broadcasts were suspended during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]]. In 1944, while the war was still raging, a new standard, offering 625 lines of vertical resolution was prepared. This format was ultimately accepted as a national standard.<ref name=\"Raspletin_100years_RussianTV\"/>\n\nThe transmissions in 625-line format started in Moscow on November 4, 1948. Regular broadcasting began on June 16, 1949. Details for this standard were formalized in 1955 specification called ''GOST 7845-55, basic parameters for black-and-white television broadcast''. In particular, frame size was set to 625 lines, frame rate to 25 frames/s interlaced, and video bandwidth to 6&nbsp;MHz. These basic parameters were accepted by most countries having 50&nbsp;Hz mains frequency and became the foundation of television systems presently known as PAL and SECAM.\n\nStarting in 1951, broadcasting in the 625-line standard was introduced in other major cities of the Soviet Union.\n\nColor television broadcast started in 1967, using SECAM color system.<ref name=\"60TH_ANNIVERSARY_OF_625\"/>\n\n=== Turkey ===\nThe first Turkish [[television]] channel, [[ITU TV]], was launched in 1952. The first national television is [[TRT 1]] and was launched in 1964. [[Color television]] was introduced in 1981. Before 1989 there was the only channel, the state broadcasting company TRT, and it broadcast in several times of the dateline. [[Turkey]]'s first private television channel [[Star TV (Turkey)|Star]] started it broadcast on 26 May 1989. Until then there was only one television channel controlled by the state, but with the wave of liberalization, privately owned broadcasting began. Turkey's television market is defined by a handful of big channels, led by [[Kanal D]], [[ATV (Turkey)|ATV]] and [[Show TV|Show]], with 14%, 10% and 9.6% market share, respectively. The most important reception platforms are terrestrial and satellite, with almost 50% of homes using satellite (of these 15% were pay services) at the end of 2009. Three services dominate the multi-channel market: the satellite platforms [[Digit\u00fcrk]] and [[D-Smart]] and the cable TV service [[Turksat (company)|T\u00fcrksat]].\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe first British television broadcast was made by Baird Television's electromechanical system over the BBC radio transmitter in September 1929. Baird provided a limited amount of programming five days a week by 1930. During this time, Southampton earned the distinction of broadcasting the first-ever live television interview, which featured Peggy O'Neil, an actress and singer from [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref>[http://www.thehydraulics.com/the_hydraulics/2009/01/peggy-oneil-sang-her-way-from-the-hydraulics-to-stardom.html Hawley, Chris, \"Peggy O'Neil sang her way from the Hydraulics to stardom\"], ''The Hydraulics'' [blog], January 15, 2009.</ref> On August 22, 1932, BBC launched its own regular service using Baird's 30-line electromechanical system, continuing until September 11, 1935.\n\nOn November 2, 1936, the [[BBC]] began transmitting the world's first public regular high-definition service from the Victorian [[Alexandra Palace]] in north London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/tvera.htm|title=THE HISTORY OF THE BBC: THE FIRST TV ERA|author=laurence marcus|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref> It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today. It was a dual-system service, alternating between Marconi-EMI's [[405-line]] standard and Baird's improved 240-line standard, from [[Alexandra Palace]] in London. The BBC Television Service continues to this day (now [[BBC One]]).\n\nThe government, on advice from a special advisory committee, decided that Marconi-EMI's electronic system gave the superior picture, and the Baird system was dropped in February 1937. TV broadcasts in London were on the air an average of four hours daily from 1936 to 1939. There were 12,000 to 15,000 receivers. Some sets in restaurants or bars might have 100 viewers for sport events (Dunlap, p56). The outbreak of the Second World War caused the BBC service to be abruptly suspended on September 1, 1939, at 12:35 pm, after a Mickey Mouse cartoon and test signals were broadcast,<ref name=MickeyMouse>{{cite web|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/tvoff/index.htm |title=The edit that rewrote history \u2013 Baird |accessdate=28 May 2007 |publisher=Transdiffusion Broadcasting System |date=31 October 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060125014953/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/tvoff/index.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> so that transmissions could not be used as a beacon to guide enemy aircraft to London.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} It resumed, again from Alexandra Palace on June 7, 1946 after the end of the war, began with a live programme that opened with the line \"Good afternoon everybody.

Later in 1928, General Electric started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters [[W2XBS]] and which today is known as [[WNBC]]. The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a [[Felix the Cat]] doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers.\n\nThe first regularly scheduled television service in the United States began on July 2, 1928, fifteen months before the United Kingdom. The [[Federal Radio Commission]] authorized [[Charles Francis Jenkins|C. F.

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) saw television in the continual flux of development with no consistent technical standards, hence all such stations in the U.S. were granted only experimental and [[non-commercial]] licenses, hampering television's economic development. Just as importantly, Philo Farnsworth's August 1934 demonstration of an all-electronic system at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia pointed out the direction of television's future.\n\nOn June 15, 1936, Don Lee Broadcasting began a one-month-long demonstration of high definition (240+ line) television in Los Angeles on W6XAO (later KTSL, now [[KCBS-TV]]) with a 300-line image from motion picture film.

From May through December 1939, the New York City NBC station (W2XBS) of RCA broadcast twenty to fifty-eight hours of programming per month, Wednesday through Sunday of each week. The programming was 33% news, 29% drama, and 17% educational programming, with an estimated 2,000 receiving sets by the end of the year, and an estimated audience of five to eight thousand. A remote truck could cover outdoor events from up to {{convert|10|mi|km}} away from the transmitter, which was located atop the [[Empire State Building]]. Coaxial cable was used to cover events at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The coverage area for reliable reception was a radius of 40 to {{convert|50|mi|km}} from the Empire State Building, an area populated by more than 10,000,000 people (Lohr, 1940).\n\nThe FCC adopted [[NTSC]] television engineering standards on May 2, 1941, calling for 525 lines of vertical resolution, 30 frames per second with [[interlaced video|interlaced scanning]], 60 fields per second, and sound carried by [[frequency modulation]]. Sets sold since 1939 that were built for slightly lower resolution could still be adjusted to receive the new standard. (Dunlap, p31). The FCC saw television ready for commercial licensing, and the first such licenses were issued to NBC- and CBS-owned stations in New York on July 1, 1941, followed by [[Philco]]'s station [[KYW-TV|WPTZ]] in [[Philadelphia]].\n\nIn the U.S., the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941, but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a [[television license]] fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), which had public service as part of its [[Royal Charter]].\n\nThe first official, paid advertising to appear on American commercial television occurred on the afternoon of July 1, 1941, over New York \nstation WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) before a baseball game between the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. The announcement for [[Bulova]] watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase \"Bulova Watch Time\", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.<ref>\"Imagery For Profit\" R.

This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables.\n\nThe abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television. It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large \"community antennas\" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes. The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924.\n\nEarly cable television was analog, but since the 2000s all cable operators have switched to, or are in the process of switching to, digital cable television.\n\n==Satellite television==\n{{main|Satellite television}}\n\n===Overview===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Satellite television system Ekran - a post stamp.jpg|thumb|right|The Ekran satellite television broadcast system (post stamp, 1981)]] -->\n'''Satellite television''' is a system of supplying [[television programming]] using [[broadcast]] signals relayed from [[communication satellite]]s. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a [[satellite dish]] and a [[low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired [[television programme]] for viewing on a [[television set]]. Receivers can be external [[set-top box]]es, or a built-in [[tuner (television)|television tuner]]. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without [[terrestrial television]] or [[cable television]].\n\nThe most common method of reception is [[direct-broadcast satellite television]] (DBSTV), also known as \"direct to home\" (DTH).<ref name=\"tr101198\">{{Cite report|author=Antipolis, Sophia|date=September 1997|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Implementation of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation in DVB satellite transmission systems|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101100_101199/101198/01.01.01_60/tr_101198v010101p.pdf|publisher=[[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]|pages=1\u20137|docket=TR 101 198|accessdate=20 July 2014|quote=}}</ref> In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a [[direct broadcast satellite]] on the [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>]] wavelength and are completely digital.<ref name=m101>{{cite journal |title=Frequency letter bands|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/letterbands.cfm|website=Microwaves101.com|date = 25 April 2008}}</ref> Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as [[television receive-only]].

Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows and other video content over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters.\n\nInternet television should not to be confused with [[Smart TV]], [[IPTV]] or with [[Web TV]]. [[Smart television]] refers to the TV set that has an inbuilt operating system. [[IPTV|Internet Protocol television]] (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. [[Web television]] is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.\n\n==Television sets==\n{{main|Television set}}\n\nA television set, also called a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or telly, is a device that combines a tuner, display, and speakers for the purpose of viewing [[television]]. Introduced in the late 1920s in [[Mechanical television|mechanical]] form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using [[cathode ray tube]]s. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as [[VHS]] and later [[DVD]]. In the late 2000s [[Flat panel display|flat panel]] television incorporating liquid-crystal displays largely replaced [[cathode ray tube]]s. Modern flat panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080p or 2160p) and can also play content from a [[USB]] device.\n\n[[File:RCA 630-TS Television.jpg|thumb|right|RCA 630-TS, the first mass-produced television set, which sold in 1946\u20131947]]\n[[Mechanical television]]s were commercially sold from 1928 to 1934 in the United Kingdom,<ref>[http://www.tvhistory.tv/Baird%20TV-Early%20Years.htm Early British Television: Baird], Television History: The First 75 Years.</ref> United States, and Soviet Union.<ref>[http://www.tvhistory.tv/pre-1935.htm Pre-1935], Television History: The First 75 Years.

The first practical transmissions of moving images over a radio system used mechanical rotating perforated disks to scan a scene into a time-varying signal that could be reconstructed at a receiver back into an approximation of the original image. Development of television was interrupted by the Second World War.  After the end of the war, all-electronic methods of scanning and displaying images became standard. Several different standards for addition of color to transmitted images were developed, with different regions using technically incompatible signal standards. \nTelevision broadcasting expanded rapidly after World War II, becoming an important [[mass media|mass medium]] for advertising, propaganda, and entertainment. <ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.nyu.edu/classes/stephens/History%20of%20Television%20page.htm|title = History of Television|date = February 6, 2015|accessdate = February 6, 2015|website = www.nyu.edu|publisher = New York University |last = Stephens|first = Mitchell}}</ref> \n \t\nTelevision broadcasts can be distributed over the air by VHF and UHF radio signals from terrestrial transmitting stations, by [[microwave]] signals from Earth orbiting satellites, or by wired transmission to individual consumers by [[cable TV]]. Many countries have moved away from the original analog radio transmission methods and now use [[digital television]] standards, providing additional operating features and conserving radio spectrum bandwidth for more profitable uses. Television programming can also be distributed over the Internet. \n\nTelevision broadcasting may be funded by advertising revenue, by private or governmental organizations prepared to underwrite the cost, or in some countries, by television license fees paid by owners of receivers. Some services, especially carried by cable or satellite, are paid by subscriptions. \n\t\nTelevision broadcasting is supported by continuing technical developments such as long-haul microwave networks, which allow distribution of programming over a wide geographic area. Video recording methods allow programming to be edited and replayed for later use. Three-dimensional television has been used commercially but has not received wide consumer acceptance owing to the limitations of display methods.\n\n==Mechanical television==\n{{main|Mechanical television}}\n\n[[Facsimile transmission]] systems pioneered methods of mechanically scanning graphics in the early 19th century.

He created his prototype in a little village called Santa Cruz on the island of Trinidad where he was recovering from an illness. He also started work on the first color television. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised [[silhouette]] images in motion, at [[Selfridges|Selfridge's]] Department Store in London.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/115504a0|title=Current Topics and Events|journal=Nature|volume=115|issue=2892|pages=504\u2013508|year=1925|bibcode=1925Natur.115..504.|doi-access=free}}</ref> Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a talking, moving ventriloquist's dummy named \"Stooky Bill\", whose painted face had higher contrast. By January 26, 1926, he had demonstrated the transmission of an image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration in history.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light that swept across the subject. A selenium [[Phototube|photoelectric tube]] detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one [[scan line]] of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face.\n\nIn 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over {{convert|438|mi|km}} of telephone line between London and [[Glasgow]]. In 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and [[Bernard Natan]] of [[Path\u00e9]] established France's first television company, T\u00e9l\u00e9vision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]].<ref>J. L. Baird, \"[http://www.bairdtelevision.com/1932.html Television in 1932]\", ''BBC Annual Report'', 1933.</ref> In 1932, he demonstrated [[ultra-short wave]] television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240 lines of resolution on [[BBC]] television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead, a [[17.5mm film]] was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet.\n\nAn American inventor, [[Charles Francis Jenkins]], also pioneered the television. He published an article on \"Motion Pictures by Wireless\" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses. On June 13, 1925, Jenkins publicly demonstrated the synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925, Jenkins used a [[Nipkow disk]] and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles (from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C.), using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution.<ref>\"Radio Shows Far Away Objects in Motion\", ''The New York Times'', June 14, 1925, p. 1.</ref><ref name=\"glinsky\">{{cite book| last = Glinsky| first = Albert| title = Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage| location = Urbana, Illinois| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2000| pages = [https://archive.org/details/thereminethermus00glin/page/41 41]\u201345| isbn = 978-0-252-02582-2| url = https://archive.org/details/thereminethermus00glin| url-access = registration}}</ref> He was granted U.S. patent 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on June 30, 1925 (filed March 13, 1922).\n\nOn December 25, 1925, [[Kenjiro Takayanagi]] demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan.

Ives]] and [[Frank Gray (researcher)|Frank Gray]] of [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on April 7, 1927. The reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a two-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen. The large receiver had a screen 24&nbsp;inches wide by 30&nbsp;inches high. Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets also received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a [[copper wire]] link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from [[Whippany, New Jersey]]. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]]. A [[flying-spot scanner]] beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 [[millisecond]]s. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: \"It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality.\"<ref>Abramson, Albert, ''The History of Television, 1880 to 1941'', McFarland & Co., Inc., 1987, p. 101. {{ISBN|978-0-89950-284-7}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1928, [[WRGB]] (then W2XB) was started as the world's first television station. It broadcast from the [[General Electric]] facility in [[Schenectady, NY]]. It was popularly known as \"[[WGY (AM)|WGY]] Television\".\n\nMeanwhile, in the [[Soviet Union]], [[L\u00e9on Theremin]] had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16-line resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using [[Interlaced video|interlacing]] in 1926. As part of his thesis on May 7, 1926, Theremin electrically transmitted and then projected near-simultaneous moving images on a five-foot square screen.<ref name=\"glinsky\"/> By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until 1931 by RCA, with 120 lines.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nBecause only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution in mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to about 120. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear.<ref>Donald F. McLean, ''Restoring Baird's Image'' (London: IEEE, 2000), p. 184.</ref> A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in [[Paris]] in 1935, and the 180-line system that [[Peck Television Corp.]] started in 1935 at station VE9AK in [[Montreal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/ve9ak.html |title=VE9AK entry at |publisher=Earlytelevision.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Peck Television Corporation Console Receiver and Camera|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/peck.html|publisher=Early Television Museum|accessdate=18 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnton Codelli (22 March 1875 - \u2020 28 April 1954), a [[Slovenia]]n nobleman, was a passionate inventor. Among other things, he had devised a miniature refrigerator for cars and a new rotary engine design. Intrigued by television, he decided to apply his technical skills to the new medium. At the time, the biggest challenge in television technology was to transmit images with sufficient resolution to reproduce recognizable figures. As recounted by media historian Melita Zajc, most inventors were determined to increase the number of lines used by their systems \u2013 some were approaching what was then the magic number of 100 lines. But Baron Codelli had a different idea. In 1929, he developed a television device with a single line \u2013 but one that formed a continuous spiral on the screen. Codelli based his ingenious design on his understanding of the human eye. He knew that objects seen in peripheral vision don't need to be as sharp as those in the center. The baron's mechanical television system, whose image was sharpest in the middle, worked well, and he was soon able to transmit images of his wife, Ilona von Drasche-Lazar, over the air.\nDespite the backing of the German electronics giant Telefunken, however, Codelli's television system never became a commercial reality. Electronic television ultimately emerged as the dominant system, and Codelli moved on to other projects. His invention was largely forgotten.\n<ref>Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940, page 192, article 1898, Anton Codelli</ref>\n<ref>Culture.si: http://www.culture.si/en/Radio-Television_Slovenia_(RTV_Slovenia), The first known transmitted TV image on the territory of Slovenia</ref>\n<ref>[[:sl:Anton Codelli (izumitelj)]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe advancement of all-electronic television (including [[Video camera tube#Image dissector|image dissector]]s and other camera tubes and [[cathode ray tube]]s for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical TV usually only produced small images. It was the main type of TV until the 1930s. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.\n\n==Electronic television==\n{{Main|Video camera tube}}\nIn 1897, [[J.

Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called \"stereoscopic\" at the time). A demonstration on August 16, 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. This used a patterned version of the phosphor plate, with the guns aimed at ridges on one side of the plate. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.<ref>Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland & Company, 2003, pp. 13\u201314. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}</ref><ref>Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System].</ref>\n\nSimilar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The [[Geer tube]] was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The [[Penetron]] used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The [[Chromatron]] used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.\n\nOne of the great technical challenges of introducing color [[broadcast television]] was the desire to conserve [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], potentially three times that of the existing [[black-and-white]] standards, and not use an excessive amount of [[radio spectrum]]. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee<ref name=name>National Television System Committee (1951\u20131953), [Report and Reports of Panel No. 11, 11-A, 12\u201319, with Some supplementary references cited in the Reports, and the Petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the Federal Communications Commission, n.p., 1953], 17 v. illus., diagrams., tables. 28 cm. LC Control No.:54021386 [http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First Library of Congress Online Catalog]</ref> approved an all-electronic [[Compatible color]] system developed by [[RCA]], which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The [[NTSC]] standard represented a major technical achievement.\n\n[[File:SMPTE Color Bars.svg|thumb|left|Color bars used in a [[test pattern]], sometimes used when no program material is available.]]\nAlthough all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953,<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G.|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7rWFRLVyvY0C&pg=PA290&dq=color+television+December+17+1953#v=onepage&q=color%20television%20December%2017%201953&f=false |year=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9781410614742 |page=290}}</ref> high prices and the scarcity of color programming greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]) occurred on January 1, 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.\n\nEarly color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy, so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of [[General Electric|GE's]] relatively compact and lightweight [[Porta-Color]] set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets.\n\nColor broadcasting in Europe was also not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color, and by the early 1980s black-and-white sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or use as [[video monitor]] screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s even these areas switched to color sets.\n\n==Digital television==\n{{main|Digital television}}\n{{see also|Digital television transition}}\n\nDigital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signal, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by [[analog television]].

It wasn't until the 1990s that digital TV became a real possibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benton.org/initiatives/obligations/charting_the_digital_broadcasting_future/sec1|title=The Origins and Future Prospects of Digital Television|accessdate=December 11, 2015|date=December 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s Japanese consumer electronics firm [[Sony Corporation]] developed HDTV technology and the [[Sony HDVS|equipment to record at such resolution]], and the [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]] analog format proposed by [[NHK]], a Japanese broadcaster, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies. Sony's system produced images at 1125-line resolution (or in digital terms, 1875x1125, close to the resolution of Full HD video<ref>1125 divided by 3, and then multiplied by 5, due to the 5:3 aspect ratio, asumming square pixels</ref>) Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard\u2014based on an analog system\u2014was the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the FCC was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.\n\nIn March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images.(7) Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being \"simulcast\" on different channels.(8)The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing NTSC standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.\n\nThe final standard adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution. This outcome resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes\u2014interlaced or progressive\u2014is superior. Interlaced scanning, which is used in televisions worldwide, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. Progressive scanning, which is the format used in computers, scans lines in sequences, from top to bottom. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not \"flicker\" in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offers a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then feasible, that is, 1080 lines per picture and 1920 pixels per line. William F. Schreiber, who was a director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemasource.com/articles/hist_politics_dtv.pdf|title=The history and politics of DTV|page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[Digital television transition]] started in the late 2000s. All the governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by the 2010s. Initially the adoption rate was low. But soon, more and more households were converting to digital televisions. The transition is expected to be completed worldwide by mid to late 2010s.\n\n==Smart television==\n{{main|Smart television}}\n{{Distinguish|Internet television|Internet Protocol television|Web television}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2014}}\n\nAdvent of digital television allowed innovations like smart TVs.

It began television broadcasting in Canada in September 1952. The first broadcast was on September 6, 1952 from its [[Montreal]] station [[CBFT]]. The premiere broadcast was bilingual, spoken in English and French. Two days later, on September 8, 1952, the [[Toronto]] station [[CBLT (TV)|CBLT]] went on the air. This became the English-speaking flagship station for the country, while CBFT became the French-language flagship after a second English-language station was licensed to CBC in Montreal later in the decade. The CBC's first privately owned affiliate television station, [[CICI-TV|CKSO]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, Ontario]], launched in October 1953 (at the time, all private stations were expected to affiliate with the CBC, a condition that was relaxed in 1960\u201361 when CTV, Canada's second national English-language network, was formed).\n\n=== Czechoslovakia ===\n[[File:H\u00f6ritz Museum - Fernseher Tesla 40001A.jpg|thumb|The first mass-produced Czechoslovak TV-set Tesla 4001A (1953-57).]]\nIn former [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]]) the first experimental [[television set]]s were produced in 1948. In the same year the first TV- transmission was performed. The first regular TV public transmission started on May 1, 1953. The state-owned TV-centers were in [[Prague]], [[Bratislava]], [[Brno]] and [[Ostrava]]. In 1961 more than a million citizens had a television set. In 1970, Czechoslovak television had three channels: Czech, Slovak and a bilingual Federal Channel. In 1973, color broadcasting started.\n\n=== France ===\nThe first experiments in television broadcasting began in France in the 1930s, although the French did not immediately employ the new technology.\n\nIn November 1929, Bernard Natan established France's first television company, T\u00e9l\u00e9vision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. On April 14, 1931, there took place the first transmission with a thirty-line standard by Ren\u00e9 Barth\u00e9lemy. On December 6, 1931, [[Henri de France]] created the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de T\u00e9l\u00e9vision (CGT). In December 1932, Barth\u00e9lemy carried out an experimental program in black and white (definition: 60 lines) one hour per week, \"Paris T\u00e9l\u00e9vision\", which gradually became daily from early 1933.\n\nThe first official channel of French television appeared on February 13, 1935, the date of the official inauguration of television in France, which was broadcast in 60 lines from 8:15 to 8:30 pm. The program showed the actress B\u00e9atrice Bretty in the studio of Radio-PTT Vision at 103 rue de Grenelle in Paris. The broadcast had a range of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}. On November 10, [[George Mandel]], Minister of Posts, inaugurated the first broadcast in 180 lines from the transmitter of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. On the 18th, Susy Wincker, the first announcer since the previous June, carried out a demonstration for the press from 5:30 to 7:30 pm. Broadcasts became regular from January 4, 1937 from 11:00 to 11:30 am and 8:00 to 8:30 pm during the week, and from 5:30 to 7:30 pm on Sundays. In July 1938, a decree defined for three years a standard of 455 lines VHF (whereas three standards were used for the experiments: 441 lines for Gramont, 450 lines for the Compagnie des Compteurs and 455 for Thomson). In 1939, there were about only 200 to 300 individual television sets, some of which were also available in a few public places.\n\nWith the entry of France into World War II the same year, broadcasts ceased and the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was sabotaged. On September 3, 1940, French television was seized by the German occupation forces. A technical agreement was signed by the Compagnie des Compteurs and [[Telefunken]], and a financing agreement for the resuming of the service is signed by German Ministry of Post and Radiodiffusion Nationale ([[Vichy France|Vichy]]'s radio). On May 7, 1943 at 3:00 evening broadcasts. The first broadcast of [[Fernsehsender Paris]] (Paris T\u00e9l\u00e9vision) was transmitted from rue Cognac-Jay. These regular broadcasts (5{{fraction|1|4}} hours a day) lasted until August 16, 1944. One thousand 441-line sets, most of which were installed in soldiers' hospitals, picked up the broadcasts. These Nazi-controlled television broadcasts from the Eiffel Tower in Paris were able to be received on the south coast of England by R.A.F. and BBC engineers,<ref>http://www.earlytelevision.org/raf.html ''R.A.F. Reception of German TV from Paris'', retrieved 2013 April 23</ref> who photographed the station identification image direct from the screen.\n\nIn 1944, Ren\u00e9 Barth\u00e9lemy developed an [[819-line]] television standard. During the years of occupation, Barth\u00e9lemy reached 1015 and even 1042 lines. On October 1, 1944, television service resumed after the [[liberation of Paris]]. The broadcasts were transmitted from the Cognacq-Jay studios. In October 1945, after repairs, the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was back in service. On November 20, 1948, [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] decreed a broadcast standard of 819 lines; broadcasting began at the end of 1949 in this definition. Besides France, this standard was later adopted by Algeria, Monaco, and Morocco. Belgium and Luxembourg used a modified version of this standard with bandwidth narrowed to 7&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=\"britbroadcasttrans\">{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=jKjoU8bokw0C&pg=PA227&lpg=PA227&dq=819+lines+television+france+belgium+denmark#v=onepage&q=819%20lines%20television%20france%20belgium%20denmark&f=false|title = British Broadcasting in Transition|author = Burton Paulu |isbn = 9781452909554|year = 1961}}</ref>\n\n=== Germany ===\nElectromechanical broadcasts began in Germany in 1929, but were without sound until 1934. Network electronic service started on March 22, 1935, on [[180 lines]] using [[telecine]] transmission of film, [[intermediate film system]], or cameras using the Nipkow Disk. Transmissions using cameras based on the [[iconoscope]] began on January 15, 1936. The Berlin [[1936 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] were televised, using both all-electronic iconoscope-based cameras and intermediate film cameras, to Berlin and [[Hamburg]] in August 1936. Twenty-eight public television rooms were opened for anybody who did not own a television set. The Germans had a 441-line system on the air in February 1937, and during [[World War II]] brought it to France, where they broadcast from the Eiffel Tower.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the victorious Allies imposed a general ban on all radio and television broadcasting in Germany. Radio broadcasts for information purposes were soon permitted again, but television broadcasting was allowed to resume only in 1948.\n\nIn East Germany, the head of broadcasting in the Soviet occupation zone, Hans Mahler, predicted in 1948 that in the near future \u2018a new and important technical step forward in the field of broadcasting in Germany will begin its triumphant march: television.\u2019  In 1950, the plans for a nationwide television service got off the ground, and a Television Centre in Berlin was approved. Transmissions began on December 21, 1952 using the 625-line standard developed in the Soviet Union in 1944, although at that time there were probably no more than 75 television receivers capable of receiving the programming.<ref>[http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/socialsciences/screening-socialism/television-histories/tvinthegdr/ \"TV in the GDR\"], ''Loughborough University''</ref><ref>[http://www.dra.de/online/hinweisdienste/kurzinformationen/70jahre-fs.pdf \"Fernsehen aus Adlershof\"], ''Deutsches Rundfunkarchiv Babelsberg''</ref>\n\nIn West Germany, the British occupation forces as well as [[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk|NWDR]] (Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk), which had started work in the British zone straight after the war, agreed to the launch of a television station. Even before this, German television specialists had agreed on 625 lines as the future standard.<ref>[https://www.ebu.ch/CMSimages/en/dossiers_1_04_eurovision50_ve_tcm6-13890.pdf \"50 years of Eurovision\"], ''EBU'', January, 2004.</ref> This standard had narrower channel bandwidth (7&nbsp;MHz) compared to the Soviet specification (8&nbsp;MHz), allowing three television channels to fit into the [[Band I|VHF I]] band.\n\nWhen color was introduced, West Germany chose a variant of the [[NTSC]] color system, modified by [[Walter Bruch]] and called [[PAL]]. East Germany accepted the French [[SECAM]] system, which was used in Eastern European countries. With the reunification of Germany, it was decided to switch to the PAL color system. The system was changed in December 1990.\n\n=== Italy ===\nIn Italy, the first experimental tests on television broadcasts were made in [[Turin]] since 1934. The city already hosted the Center for Management of the [[Ente Italiano per le Audizioni Radiofoniche|EIAR]] (lately renamed as [[RAI]]) at the premises of the Theatre of Turin. Subsequently, the EAIR established offices in [[Rome]] and [[Milan]].\nOn July 22, 1939 comes into operation in Rome the first television transmitter at the EIAR station, which performed a regular broadcast for about a year using a 441-line system that was developed in Germany. In September of the same year, a second television transmitter was installed in Milan, making experimental broadcasts during major events in the city.\n\nThe broadcasts were suddenly ended on May 31, 1940, by order of the government, allegedly because of interferences encountered in the first air navigation systems. Also, the imminent participation in the war is believed to have played a role in this decision. EIAR transmitting equipment was relocated to Germany by the German troops. Lately, it was returned to Italy.\n\nThe first official television broadcast began on January 3, 1954 by the RAI.\n\n=== Japan ===\nTelevision broadcasting in Japan started in August 28, 1953,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p07/column/index1.html |title=\"Can you see me clearly?\" Public TV image reception experiment (1939) |publisher=NHK |date=1939-05-13 |accessdate=2012-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101044401/http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p07/column/index1.html |archivedate=January 1, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> making the country one of the first in the world with an experimental television service.

Retrieved 2012-11-01.</ref> In spite of that, because of the beginning of [[World War II in the Pacific]] region, this first full-fledged TV broadcast experimentation lasted only a few months. Regular television broadcasts would eventually start in 1953.\n\nIn 1979, NHK first developed a consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 display aspect ratio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,132289-c,hdtv/article.html|title=Researchers Craft HDTV's Successor|date=May 28, 2007}}</ref> The system, known as Hi-Vision or MUSE after its [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding]] for encoding the signal, required about twice the bandwidth of the existing NTSC system but provided about four times the resolution (1080i/1125 lines). Satellite test broadcasts started in 1989, with regular testing starting in 1991 and regular broadcasting of [[Broadcasting Satellite (Japanese)|BS]]-9ch commenced on November 25, 1994, which featured commercial and NHK [[television program]]ming.\n\n[[Sony]] first demonstrated a wideband [[analog high-definition television system]] [[HDTV]] capable video camera, monitor and [[video tape recorder]] (VTR) in April 1981 at an international meeting of television engineers in [[Algiers]]. The HDVS range was launched in April 1984, with the HDC-100 camera, HDV-100 video recorder and HDS-100 [[video switcher]] all working in the 1125-line [[component video]] format with [[interlaced video]] and a 5:3 aspect ratio.\n\n=== Mexico ===\nThe first testing television station in Mexico signed on in 1935. When [[KFMB-TV]] in [[San Diego]] signed on in 1949, [[Baja California]] became the first state to receive a commercial television station over the air. Within a year, the Mexican government would adopt the U.S. NTSC 525-line B/W 60-field-per-second system as the country's broadcast standard. In 1950, the first commercial television station within Mexico, [[XHTV]] in Mexico City, signed on the air, followed by [[XEW-TV]] in 1951 and [[XHGC]] in 1952. Those three were not only the first television stations in the country, but also the flagship stations of [[Telesistema Mexicano]], which was formed in 1955. That year, [[Emilio Azc\u00e1rraga Vidaurreta]], who had signed on XEW-TV, entered into a partnership with [[R\u00f3mulo O'Farrill]] who had signed on XHTV, and [[Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez Camarena]], who had signed on XHGC. The earliest [[3D television]] broadcasts in the world were broadcast over XHGC in 1954. Color television was introduced in 1962, also over XHGC-TV. One of Telesistema Mexicano's earliest broadcasts as a network, over XEW-TV, on June 25, 1955, was the first international North American broadcast in the medium's history, and was jointly aired with NBC in the United States, where it aired as the premiere episode of ''[[Wide Wide World]],'' and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  Except for a brief period between 1969\u20131973, nearly every commercial television station in Mexico, with exceptions in the border cities, was expected to affiliate with a subnetwork of Telesistema Mexicano or its successor, [[Televisa]] (formed by the 1973 merger of Telesistema Mexicano and [[Television Independiente de Mexico]]). This condition would not be relaxed for good until 1993, when Imevision was privatized to become [[TV Azteca]].\n\n=== Soviet Union (USSR) ===\nThe Soviet Union began offering 30-line electromechanical test broadcasts in Moscow on October 31, 1931, and a commercially manufactured television set in 1932.\n\nFirst electronic television system on 180 lines at 25 fps was created in the beginning of 1935 in Leningrad (St. Petersburg). In September 1937 the experimental Leningrad TV Center (OLTC) was put in action. OLTC worked with 240 lines at 25 fps progressive scan.<ref name=\"Raspletin_100years_RussianTV\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.tvmuseum.ru/attach.asp?a_no=5850|title = Participation of A.Raspletin in developing and realization of black-and-white television standards }}</ref>\n\nIn Moscow, experimental transmissions of electronic television took place on March 9, 1937, using equipment manufactured by [[RCA]]. Regular broadcasting began on December 31, 1938. It was quickly realized that 343 lines of resolution offered by this format would have become insufficient in the long run, thus a specification for 441-line format at 25 fps interlaced was developed in 1940.<ref name=\"Raspletin_100years_RussianTV\"/>\n\nTelevision broadcasts were suspended during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]]. In 1944, while the war was still raging, a new standard, offering 625 lines of vertical resolution was prepared. This format was ultimately accepted as a national standard.<ref name=\"Raspletin_100years_RussianTV\"/>\n\nThe transmissions in 625-line format started in Moscow on November 4, 1948. Regular broadcasting began on June 16, 1949. Details for this standard were formalized in 1955 specification called ''GOST 7845-55, basic parameters for black-and-white television broadcast''. In particular, frame size was set to 625 lines, frame rate to 25 frames/s interlaced, and video bandwidth to 6&nbsp;MHz. These basic parameters were accepted by most countries having 50&nbsp;Hz mains frequency and became the foundation of television systems presently known as PAL and SECAM.\n\nStarting in 1951, broadcasting in the 625-line standard was introduced in other major cities of the Soviet Union.\n\nColor television broadcast started in 1967, using SECAM color system.<ref name=\"60TH_ANNIVERSARY_OF_625\"/>\n\n=== Turkey ===\nThe first Turkish [[television]] channel, [[ITU TV]], was launched in 1952. The first national television is [[TRT 1]] and was launched in 1964. [[Color television]] was introduced in 1981. Before 1989 there was the only channel, the state broadcasting company TRT, and it broadcast in several times of the dateline. [[Turkey]]'s first private television channel [[Star TV (Turkey)|Star]] started it broadcast on 26 May 1989. Until then there was only one television channel controlled by the state, but with the wave of liberalization, privately owned broadcasting began. Turkey's television market is defined by a handful of big channels, led by [[Kanal D]], [[ATV (Turkey)|ATV]] and [[Show TV|Show]], with 14%, 10% and 9.6% market share, respectively. The most important reception platforms are terrestrial and satellite, with almost 50% of homes using satellite (of these 15% were pay services) at the end of 2009. Three services dominate the multi-channel market: the satellite platforms [[Digit\u00fcrk]] and [[D-Smart]] and the cable TV service [[Turksat (company)|T\u00fcrksat]].\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe first British television broadcast was made by Baird Television's electromechanical system over the BBC radio transmitter in September 1929. Baird provided a limited amount of programming five days a week by 1930. During this time, Southampton earned the distinction of broadcasting the first-ever live television interview, which featured Peggy O'Neil, an actress and singer from [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref>[http://www.thehydraulics.com/the_hydraulics/2009/01/peggy-oneil-sang-her-way-from-the-hydraulics-to-stardom.html Hawley, Chris, \"Peggy O'Neil sang her way from the Hydraulics to stardom\"], ''The Hydraulics'' [blog], January 15, 2009.</ref> On August 22, 1932, BBC launched its own regular service using Baird's 30-line electromechanical system, continuing until September 11, 1935.\n\nOn November 2, 1936, the [[BBC]] began transmitting the world's first public regular high-definition service from the Victorian [[Alexandra Palace]] in north London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/tvera.htm|title=THE HISTORY OF THE BBC: THE FIRST TV ERA|author=laurence marcus|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref> It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today. It was a dual-system service, alternating between Marconi-EMI's [[405-line]] standard and Baird's improved 240-line standard, from [[Alexandra Palace]] in London. The BBC Television Service continues to this day (now [[BBC One]]).\n\nThe government, on advice from a special advisory committee, decided that Marconi-EMI's electronic system gave the superior picture, and the Baird system was dropped in February 1937. TV broadcasts in London were on the air an average of four hours daily from 1936 to 1939. There were 12,000 to 15,000 receivers. Some sets in restaurants or bars might have 100 viewers for sport events (Dunlap, p56). The outbreak of the Second World War caused the BBC service to be abruptly suspended on September 1, 1939, at 12:35 pm, after a Mickey Mouse cartoon and test signals were broadcast,<ref name=MickeyMouse>{{cite web|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/tvoff/index.htm |title=The edit that rewrote history \u2013 Baird |accessdate=28 May 2007 |publisher=Transdiffusion Broadcasting System |date=31 October 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060125014953/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/tvoff/index.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> so that transmissions could not be used as a beacon to guide enemy aircraft to London.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} It resumed, again from Alexandra Palace on June 7, 1946 after the end of the war, began with a live programme that opened with the line \"Good afternoon everybody.

Later in 1928, General Electric started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters [[W2XBS]] and which today is known as [[WNBC]]. The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a [[Felix the Cat]] doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers.\n\nThe first regularly scheduled television service in the United States began on July 2, 1928, fifteen months before the United Kingdom. The [[Federal Radio Commission]] authorized [[Charles Francis Jenkins|C. F. Jenkins]] to broadcast from experimental station W3XK in Wheaton, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}. For at least the first eighteen months, 48-line silhouette images from motion picture film were broadcast, although beginning in the summer of 1929 he occasionally broadcast in halftones.<ref>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=wd4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA820 What Television Offers You]\", ''Popular Mechanics'', November 1928, p. 823.</ref><ref>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=xt4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA472 The Latest in Television]\", ''Popular Mechanics'', September 1929, p. 472.</ref>\n\n[[Hugo Gernsback]]'s New York City radio station began a regular, if limited, schedule of [[live television]] broadcasts on August 14, 1928, using 48-line images.

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) saw television in the continual flux of development with no consistent technical standards, hence all such stations in the U.S. were granted only experimental and [[non-commercial]] licenses, hampering television's economic development. Just as importantly, Philo Farnsworth's August 1934 demonstration of an all-electronic system at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia pointed out the direction of television's future.\n\nOn June 15, 1936, Don Lee Broadcasting began a one-month-long demonstration of high definition (240+ line) television in Los Angeles on W6XAO (later KTSL, now [[KCBS-TV]]) with a 300-line image from motion picture film.

From May through December 1939, the New York City NBC station (W2XBS) of RCA broadcast twenty to fifty-eight hours of programming per month, Wednesday through Sunday of each week. The programming was 33% news, 29% drama, and 17% educational programming, with an estimated 2,000 receiving sets by the end of the year, and an estimated audience of five to eight thousand. A remote truck could cover outdoor events from up to {{convert|10|mi|km}} away from the transmitter, which was located atop the [[Empire State Building]]. Coaxial cable was used to cover events at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The coverage area for reliable reception was a radius of 40 to {{convert|50|mi|km}} from the Empire State Building, an area populated by more than 10,000,000 people (Lohr, 1940).\n\nThe FCC adopted [[NTSC]] television engineering standards on May 2, 1941, calling for 525 lines of vertical resolution, 30 frames per second with [[interlaced video|interlaced scanning]], 60 fields per second, and sound carried by [[frequency modulation]]. Sets sold since 1939 that were built for slightly lower resolution could still be adjusted to receive the new standard. (Dunlap, p31). The FCC saw television ready for commercial licensing, and the first such licenses were issued to NBC- and CBS-owned stations in New York on July 1, 1941, followed by [[Philco]]'s station [[KYW-TV|WPTZ]] in [[Philadelphia]].\n\nIn the U.S., the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941, but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a [[television license]] fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), which had public service as part of its [[Royal Charter]].\n\nThe first official, paid advertising to appear on American commercial television occurred on the afternoon of July 1, 1941, over New York \nstation WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) before a baseball game between the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. The announcement for [[Bulova]] watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase \"Bulova Watch Time\", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.<ref>\"Imagery For Profit\" R.

This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables.\n\nThe abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television. It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large \"community antennas\" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes. The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924.\n\nEarly cable television was analog, but since the 2000s all cable operators have switched to, or are in the process of switching to, digital cable television.\n\n==Satellite television==\n{{main|Satellite television}}\n\n===Overview===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Satellite television system Ekran - a post stamp.jpg|thumb|right|The Ekran satellite television broadcast system (post stamp, 1981)]] -->\n'''Satellite television''' is a system of supplying [[television programming]] using [[broadcast]] signals relayed from [[communication satellite]]s. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a [[satellite dish]] and a [[low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired [[television programme]] for viewing on a [[television set]]. Receivers can be external [[set-top box]]es, or a built-in [[tuner (television)|television tuner]]. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without [[terrestrial television]] or [[cable television]].\n\nThe most common method of reception is [[direct-broadcast satellite television]] (DBSTV), also known as \"direct to home\" (DTH).<ref name=\"tr101198\">{{Cite report|author=Antipolis, Sophia|date=September 1997|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Implementation of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation in DVB satellite transmission systems|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101100_101199/101198/01.01.01_60/tr_101198v010101p.pdf|publisher=[[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]|pages=1\u20137|docket=TR 101 198|accessdate=20 July 2014|quote=}}</ref> In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a [[direct broadcast satellite]] on the [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>]] wavelength and are completely digital.<ref name=m101>{{cite journal |title=Frequency letter bands|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/letterbands.cfm|website=Microwaves101.com|date = 25 April 2008}}</ref> Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as [[television receive-only]].

Its popularity declined with the 1994 launch of the [[Hughes Communications|Hughes]] [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] satellite television systems.\n\nOn March 4, 1996 EchoStar introduced Digital Sky Highway (Dish Network) using the EchoStar 1 satellite.<ref name=\"ctu10e\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=August E.|title=Communication Technology Update|edition=10th|url=|location=|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|page=87|isbn=978-0-240-81475-9|year=2010}}</ref> EchoStar launched a second satellite in September 1996 to increase the number of channels available on Dish Network to 170.<ref name=\"ctu10e\"/> These systems provided better pictures and stereo sound on 150-200 video and audio channels, and allowed small dishes to be used.

Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows and other video content over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters.\n\nInternet television should not to be confused with [[Smart TV]], [[IPTV]] or with [[Web TV]]. [[Smart television]] refers to the TV set that has an inbuilt operating system. [[IPTV|Internet Protocol television]] (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. [[Web television]] is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.\n\n==Television sets==\n{{main|Television set}}\n\nA television set, also called a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or telly, is a device that combines a tuner, display, and speakers for the purpose of viewing [[television]]. Introduced in the late 1920s in [[Mechanical television|mechanical]] form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using [[cathode ray tube]]s. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as [[VHS]] and later [[DVD]]. In the late 2000s [[Flat panel display|flat panel]] television incorporating liquid-crystal displays largely replaced [[cathode ray tube]]s. Modern flat panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080p or 2160p) and can also play content from a [[USB]] device.\n\n[[File:RCA 630-TS Television.jpg|thumb|right|RCA 630-TS, the first mass-produced television set, which sold in 1946\u20131947]]\n[[Mechanical television]]s were commercially sold from 1928 to 1934 in the United Kingdom,<ref>[http://www.tvhistory.tv/Baird%20TV-Early%20Years.htm Early British Television: Baird], Television History: The First 75 Years.</ref> United States, and Soviet Union.<ref>[http://www.tvhistory.tv/pre-1935.htm Pre-1935], Television History: The First 75 Years.

She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, \"I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now, which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on, and that makes it more dangerous.

She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, \"I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now, which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on, and that makes it more dangerous. But then, the danger makes it more exciting.\" She has stated that her ideal director is one who gives her complete artistic control, and allowing her a degree of improvisation and to learn from her own mistakes.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}}\n\nKarina Longworth notes how \"external\" Streep's performances are, \"chameleonic\" in her impersonation of characters, \"subsuming herself into them, rather than personifying them\". In her early roles such as ''Manhattan'' and ''Kramer vs. Kramer'', she was compared to both [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Jill Clayburgh]], in that her characters were unsympathetic, which Streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and lack empathy.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}} Streep has stated that many consider her to be a technical actor, but she professed that it comes down to her love of reading the initial script, adding, \"I come ready and I don't want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable\".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=16}}\n\n[[File:Meryl Streep - Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|Streep's star on the ''[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]'']]\nMike Nichols, who directed Streep in ''Silkwood'', ''Heartburn'', ''Postcards from the Edge'', and ''Angels in America'', praised Streep's ability to transform herself into her characters, remarking that, \"In every role, she becomes a totally new human being.
