In 1992 he shared a [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] with [[Michael Rapoport]], [[Peter Schneider (mathematician)|Peter Schneider]] and [[Thomas Zink]].

While focussing on [[arithmetic geometry]], including his particularly influential work on [[L-function|''L''-functions]], Deninger has also studied analytical questions, often with an eye on analogies between arithmetic and analysis.\n\n==Mathematical work==\n\n===Artin\u2013Verdier duality===\nIn a series of papers between 1984 and 1987, Deninger studied extensions of [[Artin\u2013Verdier duality]]. Broadly speaking, Artin\u2013Verdier duality, a consequence of [[class field theory]], is an arithmetic analogue of [[Poincar\u00e9 duality]], a [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] for [[sheaf cohomology]] on a compact manifold. In this parallel, the ([[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] of the) ring of integers in a [[number field]] corresponds to a [[3-manifold]]. Following work of [[Barry Mazur|Mazur]], [[#CITEREF\u20141984|Deninger (1984)]] extended Artin\u2013Verdier duality to [[Algebraic function field|function field]]s. Deninger then extended these results in various directions, such as non-torsion sheaves ([[#CITEREF\u20141986|1986]]), [[arithmetic surface]]s ([[#CITEREF\u20141987|1987]]), as well as higher-dimensional [[local field]]s ([[#CITEREF\u2014Wingberg1986|with Wingberg, 1986]]). The appearance of [[Spencer Bloch|Bloch's]] [[motivic complex]]es considered in the latter papers influenced work of several authors including {{harvtxt|Geisser|2010}}, who identified Bloch's complexes to be the dualizing complexes over higher-dimensional schemes.\n\n===Special values of ''L''-functions===\nAnother group of Deninger's papers studies [[L-function|''L''-functions]] and their special values. A classical example of an ''L''-function is the [[Riemann zeta function]] &zeta;(''s''), for which formulas such as\n:[[Basel problem|&zeta;(2) = &pi;<sup>2</sup> / 6]]\nare known since Euler. In a landmark paper, {{harvtxt|Beilinson|1984}} had proposed a set of far-reaching conjectures describing the special values of ''L''-functions, i.e., the values of ''L''-functions at integers. In very rough terms, [[Beilinson conjecture|Beilinson's conjectures]] assert that for a smooth projective [[algebraic variety]] ''X'' over '''Q''',  [[motivic cohomology]] of ''X'' should be closely related to [[Deligne cohomology]] of ''X''. In addition, the relation between these two cohomology theories should explain, according to Beilinson's conjecture, the pole orders and the values of\n:''L''(''h''<sup>''n''</sup>(''X''), ''s'')\n[[File:BorromeanRings.svg|thumb|right|Any two of the three [[Borromean rings]] can be pulled apart, yet the three rings are linked. The Massey product of the three cohomology classes given by winding around each circle can be used to capture this phenomenon algebraically.]]\nat integers ''s''. Bloch and Beilinson proved essential parts of this conjecture for ''h''<sup>1</sup>(''X'') in the case where ''X'' is an [[elliptic curve]] with [[complex multiplication]] and ''s''=2. In [[#CITEREF\u2014Wingberg1988|1988]], Deninger & Wingberg gave an exposition of that result. In [[#CITREFDeninger1989|1989]] and [[#CITEREFDeniger1990|1990]], Deninger extended this result to certain elliptic curves considered by Shimura, at all ''s''&ge;2. Deninger & Nart ([[#CITEREF\u2014Nart1995|1995]]) expressed the [[height pairing]], a key ingredient of Beilinson's conjecture, as a natural pairing of [[Ext functor|Ext-groups]] in a certain category of motives. In [[#CITEREF\u20141995|1995]], Deninger  studied [[Massey product]]s in Deligne cohomology and conjectured therefrom a formula for the special value for the ''L''-function of an [[elliptic curve]] at ''s''=3, which was subsequently confirmed by {{harvtxt|Goncharov|1996}}. As of 2018, Beilinson's conjecture is still wide open, and Deninger's contributions remain some of the few cases where Beilinson's conjecture has been successfully attacked (surveys on the topic include [[#CITEREF\u2014Scholl1991|Deninger & Scholl (1991)]], {{harvtxt|Nekov\u00e1\u0159|1994}}).\n\n===''L''-functions via regularized determinants===\nThe Riemann &zeta;-function is defined using a [[Euler product|product of Euler factors]]\n:<math>\\zeta_p(s) := \\frac 1 {1-p^{-s}}</math>\nfor each prime number ''p''. In order to obtain a functional equation for &zeta;(''s''), one needs to multiply them with an additional term involving the [[Gamma function]]:\n:<math>\\zeta_\\infty(s) := 2^{-1/2} \\pi^{-s/2} \\Gamma(s/2).</math>\nMore general ''L''-functions are also defined by Euler products, involving, at each finite place, the determinant of the [[Frobenius endomorphism]] acting on [[l-adic cohomology]] of some [[algebraic variety|variety]] ''X'' / '''Q''', while the Euler factor for the infinite place are, according to [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]], products of Gamma functions depending on the [[Hodge structure]]s attached to ''X'' / '''Q'''. {{harvtxt|Deninger|1991}} expressed these &Gamma;-factors in terms of [[functional determinant|regularized determinant]]s and moved on, in [[#CITEREF\u20141992|1992]] and in greater generality in [[#CITEREF\u20141994b|1994]], to unify the Euler factors of ''L''-functions at both finite and infinite places using regularized determinants. For example, for the Euler factors of the Riemann zeta-function this uniform description reads\n:<math>\\zeta_p(s) = \\det{}_\\infty \\left (\\frac 1{2 \\pi}(s - \\Theta) | R_p ) \\right)^{-1}.</math>\nHere ''p'' is either a prime number or infinity, corresponding to the non-Archimedean Euler factors and the Archimedean Euler factor respectively, and ''R''<sub>''p''</sub> is the space of finite real valued Fourier series on '''R'''/log(''p'')'''Z''' for a prime number ''p'', and ''R''<sub>\u221e</sub> = '''R'''[exp(&minus;2''y'')]. Finally, &Theta; is the derivative of the '''R'''-action given by shifting such functions.\n[[#CITEREF\u20141994a|Deninger (1994)]] also exhibited a similar unifying approach for &epsilon;-factors (which express the ratio between completed ''L''-functions at ''s'' and at 1&minus;''s'').\n\n===The arithmetic site===\nThese results led Deninger to propose a program concerning the existence of an \"arithmetic site\" ''Y'' associated to the [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of [[Spectrum of a ring|Spec]] '''Z'''. Among other properties, this site would be equipped with an [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of '''R''', and each prime number ''p'' would correspond to a closed orbit of the '''R'''-action of length log(''p''). Moreover, analogies between formulas in analytic number theory and dynamics on [[foliation|foliated spaces]] led Deninger to conjecture the existence of a foliation on this site. Moreover, this site is supposed to be endowed with an infinite-dimensional cohomology theory such that the ''L''-function of a motive ''M'' is given by\n:<math>L(M, s) = \\prod_{i=0}^2 \\det{}_\\infty \\left (\\frac 1 {2\\pi}(s-\\Theta)|H^i_c(Y, F(M)) \\right ).</math>\nHere ''M'' is a [[motive (mathematics)|motive]], such as the motives ''h''<sup>''n''</sup>(''X'') occurring in Beilinson's conjecture, and ''F''(''M'') is conceived to be the sheaf on ''Y'' attached to the motive ''M''. The operator &Theta; is the [[Lie group|infinitesimal generator]] of the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] given by the '''R'''-action. The [[Riemann hypothesis]] would be, according to this program, a consequence of properties parallel to the positivity of the intersection pairing in [[Hodge theory]]. A version of the [[Lefschetz trace formula]] on this site, which would be part of this conjectural setup, has been proven by other means by [[#CITEREF\u20141993|Deninger (1993)]]. In [[#CITEREF\u2014|2010]], Deninger proved that  classical conjectures of Beilinson and Bloch concerning the [[intersection theory]] of [[algebraic cycle]]s would be further consequences of his program.\n\nThis program was surveyed by Deninger in his talks at the [[European Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[#CITEREF\u20141994c|1992]], at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[#CITEREF\u20141998|1998]], and also by {{harvtxt|Leichtnam|2005}}. In [[#CITEREF\u20142002|2002]], Deninger constructed a foliated space which corresponds to an [[elliptic curve]] over a [[finite field]], and {{harvtxt|Hesselholt|2016}} showed that the Hasse-Weil zeta-function of a smooth proper variety over '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub> can be expressed using regularized determinants involving [[Hochschild homology|topological Hochschild homology]]. In addition, the analogy between knots and primes has been fruitfully studied in [[arithmetic topology]]. However, as of 2018, the construction of a foliated space corresponding to Spec '''Z''' remains elusive.\n\n===Vector bundles on ''p''-adic curves===\nA series of joint papers with Annette Werner examines [[vector bundle]]s on ''p''-adic curves. A classical result motivating this study is the [[Narasimhan\u2013Seshadri theorem]], a cornerstone of the [[Simpson correspondence]]. It asserts that a vector bundle on a compact [[Riemann surface]] ''X'' is [[stable bundle|stable]] if it arises from a [[unitary representation]] of the [[fundamental group]] &pi;<sub>1</sub>(''X'').\n\nIn [[#CITEREF\u2014Werner2005|Deninger & Werner (2005)]] established a [[p-adic numbers|''p''-adic]] analogue thereof: for a smooth projective [[algebraic curve]] over '''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>, obtained by base change from <math>X / \\overline \\mathbf Q_p</math>, they constructed an action of the [[etale fundamental group]] &pi;<sub>1</sub>(X) on the fibers on certain vector bundles, including those of degree 0 and having potentially strongly semistable reduction. In another paper of [[#CITEREF\u2014Werner2005b|2005]], they related the resulting representations of the fundamental group of the curve ''X'' with representations of the [[Tate module]] of the [[Jacobian variety]] of ''X''. In [[#CITEREF\u2014Werner2007|2007]] and [[#CITEREF\u2014Werner2010|2010]] they continued this work by showing that such vector bundles form a [[Tannakian category]] which amounts to identifying this class of vector bundles as a category of representations of a certain group.\n\n===Foliations and the Heisenberg group===\nIn several joint papers, Deninger and Wilhelm Singhof studied quotients of the ''n''-dimensional [[Heisenberg group]] ''H''  by the standard [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] consisting of integer-valued matrices,\n\n: ''X'' = ''H'' / &Gamma;,\n\nfrom various points of view. In [[#CITEREF\u2014Singhof1984|1984]], they computed the [[e-invariant]] of ''X'' in terms of &zeta;(&minus;''n''), which leads to a construction of elements in the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] of arbitrarily large order. In [[#CITEREF\u2014Singhof1988|1988]], they used methods of [[analytic number theory]] to give estimates on the dimension of the [[Lie algebra cohomology|cohomology]] of [[nilpotent Lie algebra]]s.\n\nThe classical fact from [[Hodge theory]] that any cohomology class on a K\u00e4hler manifold admits a unique [[harmonic form|harmonic]] had been generalized by {{harvtxt|\u00c1lvarez L\u00f3pez|Kordyukov|2001}} to Riemannian [[foliation]]s. [[#CITEREF\u2014Singhof2001|Deninger & Singhof (2001)]] show that foliations on the above space ''X'', which satisfy only slightly weaker conditions, do not admit such Hodge theoretic properties. In another joint paper from [[#CITREFDeningerSinghof2001b|2001]], they established a dynamical Lefschetz trace formula: it relates the trace of an operator on harmonic forms the local traces appearing at the closed orbits (on certain foliated spaces with an '''R'''-action). This result serves as a corroboration of Deninger's program mentioned above in the sense that it verifies a prediction made by this program on the analytic side, i.e., the one concerning dynamics on foliated spaces.\n\n===Entropy and Mahler measures===\n\nAnother group of Deninger's papers revolves around the space\n:<math>X_f := (\\mathbf Z \\Gamma / \\mathbf Z \\Gamma f)\\widehat{\\ }\\ , </math>\n\nwhere &Gamma; is a discrete group, ''f'' is an element of its [[group ring]] '''Z'''&Gamma;, and the hat denotes the [[Pontryagin dual]]. For &Gamma; = '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup> and <math>f \\in \\mathbb Z[x_1^{\\pm 1}, \\dots, x_n^{\\pm n}]</math>, {{harvtxt|Lind|Schmidt|Ward|1990}} had shown that the entropy of the &Gamma;-action on ''X''<sub>''f''</sub> is given by the [[Mahler measure]]\n\n:<math>m(f) := (2 \\pi i)^{-n} \\int_{\\mathbb R^n / \\Gamma} \\log |f(z_1, \\dots, z_n)| \\frac{ dz_1}{z_1} \\dots \\frac{ dz_n}{z_n}.</math>\n\nMoreover, it had been known that Mahler measures of certain polynomials were known to be expressible in terms of special values of certain L-functions. In [[#CITEREF\u20141997|1997]], Deninger observed that the integrand in the definition of the Mahler measure has a natural explanation in terms of Deligne cohomology. Using known cases of the Beilinson conjecture, he deduced that ''m''(''f'') is the image of the symbol {''f'', ''t''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''t''<sub>''n''</sub>} under the Beilinson regulator, where the variety is the complement in the ''n''-dimensional [[algebraic torus|torus]] of the zero set of ''f''. This led to a conceptual explanation for the afore-mentioned formulas for Mahler measures. {{harvtxt|Besser|Deninger|1999}} and Deninger later in [[#CITEREF\u20142009|2009]] carried over these ideas to the ''p''-adic world, by replacing the Beilinson regulator map to Deligne cohomology by a regulator map to [[syntomic cohomology]], and the logarithm appearing in the definition of the entropy by a [[p-adic logarithm|''p''-adic logarithm]].\n\nIn [[#CITEREF\u20142006|2006]] and [[#CITEREF\u2014Schmidt2007|2007]], Deninger and [[Klaus Schmidt (mathematician)|Klaus Schmidt]] pushed the parallel between entropy and Mahler measures beyond abelian groups, namely residually finite, countable discrete [[amenable group]]s &Gamma;. They showed that the &Gamma;-action on ''X''<sub>''f''</sub> is [[expansive action|expansive]] if and only if ''f'' is invertible in the ''L''<sup>1</sup>-[[convolution algebra]] of &Gamma;. Moreover, the logarithm of the [[Fuglede-Kadison determinant]] on the [[von Neumann algebra]] N&Gamma; associated to &Gamma; (which replaces the Mahler measure for '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup>) agrees with the [[entropy]] of the above action.\n\n===Witt vectors===\n[[Joachim Cuntz]] and Deninger worked together on [[Witt vector]]s. In two papers around 2014, they simplified the theory by giving a presentation of the ring of Witt vectors in terms of a completion of the [[monoid algebra]] '''Z'''''R''. This approach avoids the universal polynomials used in the classical definition of the addition of Witt vectors.\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n\n===Artin\u2013Verdier duality===\n* {{Citation|last1=Deninger|first1=Christopher|title=On Artin\u2013Verdier duality for function fields|journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift|year=1984|volume=188|issue=1|pages=91\u2013100|mr=767366|doi=10.1007/BF01163876}}\n*{{Citation|author=\u2014|title=An extension of Artin\u2013Verdier duality to nontorsion sheaves|journal=J.

In 1992 he shared a [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] with [[Michael Rapoport]], [[Peter Schneider (mathematician)|Peter Schneider]] and [[Thomas Zink]].

While focussing on [[arithmetic geometry]], including his particularly influential work on [[L-function|''L''-functions]], Deninger has also studied analytical questions, often with an eye on analogies between arithmetic and analysis.\n\n==Mathematical work==\n\n===Artin\u2013Verdier duality===\nIn a series of papers between 1984 and 1987, Deninger studied extensions of [[Artin\u2013Verdier duality]]. Broadly speaking, Artin\u2013Verdier duality, a consequence of [[class field theory]], is an arithmetic analogue of [[Poincar\u00e9 duality]], a [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] for [[sheaf cohomology]] on a compact manifold. In this parallel, the ([[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] of the) ring of integers in a [[number field]] corresponds to a [[3-manifold]]. Following work of [[Barry Mazur|Mazur]], [[#CITEREF\u20141984|Deninger (1984)]] extended Artin\u2013Verdier duality to [[Algebraic function field|function field]]s. Deninger then extended these results in various directions, such as non-torsion sheaves ([[#CITEREF\u20141986|1986]]), [[arithmetic surface]]s ([[#CITEREF\u20141987|1987]]), as well as higher-dimensional [[local field]]s ([[#CITEREF\u2014Wingberg1986|with Wingberg, 1986]]). The appearance of [[Spencer Bloch|Bloch's]] [[motivic complex]]es considered in the latter papers influenced work of several authors including {{harvtxt|Geisser|2010}}, who identified Bloch's complexes to be the dualizing complexes over higher-dimensional schemes.\n\n===Special values of ''L''-functions===\nAnother group of Deninger's papers studies [[L-function|''L''-functions]] and their special values. A classical example of an ''L''-function is the [[Riemann zeta function]] &zeta;(''s''), for which formulas such as\n:[[Basel problem|&zeta;(2) = &pi;<sup>2</sup> / 6]]\nare known since Euler. In a landmark paper, {{harvtxt|Beilinson|1984}} had proposed a set of far-reaching conjectures describing the special values of ''L''-functions, i.e., the values of ''L''-functions at integers. In very rough terms, [[Beilinson conjecture|Beilinson's conjectures]] assert that for a smooth projective [[algebraic variety]] ''X'' over '''Q''',  [[motivic cohomology]] of ''X'' should be closely related to [[Deligne cohomology]] of ''X''. In addition, the relation between these two cohomology theories should explain, according to Beilinson's conjecture, the pole orders and the values of\n:''L''(''h''<sup>''n''</sup>(''X''), ''s'')\n[[File:BorromeanRings.svg|thumb|right|Any two of the three [[Borromean rings]] can be pulled apart, yet the three rings are linked. The Massey product of the three cohomology classes given by winding around each circle can be used to capture this phenomenon algebraically.]]\nat integers ''s''. Bloch and Beilinson proved essential parts of this conjecture for ''h''<sup>1</sup>(''X'') in the case where ''X'' is an [[elliptic curve]] with [[complex multiplication]] and ''s''=2. In [[#CITEREF\u2014Wingberg1988|1988]], Deninger & Wingberg gave an exposition of that result. In [[#CITREFDeninger1989|1989]] and [[#CITEREFDeniger1990|1990]], Deninger extended this result to certain elliptic curves considered by Shimura, at all ''s''&ge;2. Deninger & Nart ([[#CITEREF\u2014Nart1995|1995]]) expressed the [[height pairing]], a key ingredient of Beilinson's conjecture, as a natural pairing of [[Ext functor|Ext-groups]] in a certain category of motives. In [[#CITEREF\u20141995|1995]], Deninger  studied [[Massey product]]s in Deligne cohomology and conjectured therefrom a formula for the special value for the ''L''-function of an [[elliptic curve]] at ''s''=3, which was subsequently confirmed by {{harvtxt|Goncharov|1996}}. As of 2018, Beilinson's conjecture is still wide open, and Deninger's contributions remain some of the few cases where Beilinson's conjecture has been successfully attacked (surveys on the topic include [[#CITEREF\u2014Scholl1991|Deninger & Scholl (1991)]], {{harvtxt|Nekov\u00e1\u0159|1994}}).\n\n===''L''-functions via regularized determinants===\nThe Riemann &zeta;-function is defined using a [[Euler product|product of Euler factors]]\n:<math>\\zeta_p(s) := \\frac 1 {1-p^{-s}}</math>\nfor each prime number ''p''. In order to obtain a functional equation for &zeta;(''s''), one needs to multiply them with an additional term involving the [[Gamma function]]:\n:<math>\\zeta_\\infty(s) := 2^{-1/2} \\pi^{-s/2} \\Gamma(s/2).</math>\nMore general ''L''-functions are also defined by Euler products, involving, at each finite place, the determinant of the [[Frobenius endomorphism]] acting on [[l-adic cohomology]] of some [[algebraic variety|variety]] ''X'' / '''Q''', while the Euler factor for the infinite place are, according to [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]], products of Gamma functions depending on the [[Hodge structure]]s attached to ''X'' / '''Q'''. {{harvtxt|Deninger|1991}} expressed these &Gamma;-factors in terms of [[functional determinant|regularized determinant]]s and moved on, in [[#CITEREF\u20141992|1992]] and in greater generality in [[#CITEREF\u20141994b|1994]], to unify the Euler factors of ''L''-functions at both finite and infinite places using regularized determinants. For example, for the Euler factors of the Riemann zeta-function this uniform description reads\n:<math>\\zeta_p(s) = \\det{}_\\infty \\left (\\frac 1{2 \\pi}(s - \\Theta) | R_p ) \\right)^{-1}.</math>\nHere ''p'' is either a prime number or infinity, corresponding to the non-Archimedean Euler factors and the Archimedean Euler factor respectively, and ''R''<sub>''p''</sub> is the space of finite real valued Fourier series on '''R'''/log(''p'')'''Z''' for a prime number ''p'', and ''R''<sub>\u221e</sub> = '''R'''[exp(&minus;2''y'')]. Finally, &Theta; is the derivative of the '''R'''-action given by shifting such functions.\n[[#CITEREF\u20141994a|Deninger (1994)]] also exhibited a similar unifying approach for &epsilon;-factors (which express the ratio between completed ''L''-functions at ''s'' and at 1&minus;''s'').\n\n===The arithmetic site===\nThese results led Deninger to propose a program concerning the existence of an \"arithmetic site\" ''Y'' associated to the [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of [[Spectrum of a ring|Spec]] '''Z'''. Among other properties, this site would be equipped with an [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of '''R''', and each prime number ''p'' would correspond to a closed orbit of the '''R'''-action of length log(''p''). Moreover, analogies between formulas in analytic number theory and dynamics on [[foliation|foliated spaces]] led Deninger to conjecture the existence of a foliation on this site. Moreover, this site is supposed to be endowed with an infinite-dimensional cohomology theory such that the ''L''-function of a motive ''M'' is given by\n:<math>L(M, s) = \\prod_{i=0}^2 \\det{}_\\infty \\left (\\frac 1 {2\\pi}(s-\\Theta)|H^i_c(Y, F(M)) \\right ).</math>\nHere ''M'' is a [[motive (mathematics)|motive]], such as the motives ''h''<sup>''n''</sup>(''X'') occurring in Beilinson's conjecture, and ''F''(''M'') is conceived to be the sheaf on ''Y'' attached to the motive ''M''. The operator &Theta; is the [[Lie group|infinitesimal generator]] of the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] given by the '''R'''-action. The [[Riemann hypothesis]] would be, according to this program, a consequence of properties parallel to the positivity of the intersection pairing in [[Hodge theory]]. A version of the [[Lefschetz trace formula]] on this site, which would be part of this conjectural setup, has been proven by other means by [[#CITEREF\u20141993|Deninger (1993)]]. In [[#CITEREF\u2014|2010]], Deninger proved that  classical conjectures of Beilinson and Bloch concerning the [[intersection theory]] of [[algebraic cycle]]s would be further consequences of his program.\n\nThis program was surveyed by Deninger in his talks at the [[European Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[#CITEREF\u20141994c|1992]], at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[#CITEREF\u20141998|1998]], and also by {{harvtxt|Leichtnam|2005}}. In [[#CITEREF\u20142002|2002]], Deninger constructed a foliated space which corresponds to an [[elliptic curve]] over a [[finite field]], and {{harvtxt|Hesselholt|2016}} showed that the Hasse-Weil zeta-function of a smooth proper variety over '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub> can be expressed using regularized determinants involving [[Hochschild homology|topological Hochschild homology]]. In addition, the analogy between knots and primes has been fruitfully studied in [[arithmetic topology]]. However, as of 2018, the construction of a foliated space corresponding to Spec '''Z''' remains elusive.\n\n===Vector bundles on ''p''-adic curves===\nA series of joint papers with Annette Werner examines [[vector bundle]]s on ''p''-adic curves. A classical result motivating this study is the [[Narasimhan\u2013Seshadri theorem]], a cornerstone of the [[Simpson correspondence]]. It asserts that a vector bundle on a compact [[Riemann surface]] ''X'' is [[stable bundle|stable]] if it arises from a [[unitary representation]] of the [[fundamental group]] &pi;<sub>1</sub>(''X'').\n\nIn [[#CITEREF\u2014Werner2005|Deninger & Werner (2005)]] established a [[p-adic numbers|''p''-adic]] analogue thereof: for a smooth projective [[algebraic curve]] over '''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>, obtained by base change from <math>X / \\overline \\mathbf Q_p</math>, they constructed an action of the [[etale fundamental group]] &pi;<sub>1</sub>(X) on the fibers on certain vector bundles, including those of degree 0 and having potentially strongly semistable reduction. In another paper of [[#CITEREF\u2014Werner2005b|2005]], they related the resulting representations of the fundamental group of the curve ''X'' with representations of the [[Tate module]] of the [[Jacobian variety]] of ''X''. In [[#CITEREF\u2014Werner2007|2007]] and [[#CITEREF\u2014Werner2010|2010]] they continued this work by showing that such vector bundles form a [[Tannakian category]] which amounts to identifying this class of vector bundles as a category of representations of a certain group.\n\n===Foliations and the Heisenberg group===\nIn several joint papers, Deninger and Wilhelm Singhof studied quotients of the ''n''-dimensional [[Heisenberg group]] ''H''  by the standard [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] consisting of integer-valued matrices,\n\n: ''X'' = ''H'' / &Gamma;,\n\nfrom various points of view. In [[#CITEREF\u2014Singhof1984|1984]], they computed the [[e-invariant]] of ''X'' in terms of &zeta;(&minus;''n''), which leads to a construction of elements in the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] of arbitrarily large order. In [[#CITEREF\u2014Singhof1988|1988]], they used methods of [[analytic number theory]] to give estimates on the dimension of the [[Lie algebra cohomology|cohomology]] of [[nilpotent Lie algebra]]s.\n\nThe classical fact from [[Hodge theory]] that any cohomology class on a K\u00e4hler manifold admits a unique [[harmonic form|harmonic]] had been generalized by {{harvtxt|\u00c1lvarez L\u00f3pez|Kordyukov|2001}} to Riemannian [[foliation]]s. [[#CITEREF\u2014Singhof2001|Deninger & Singhof (2001)]] show that foliations on the above space ''X'', which satisfy only slightly weaker conditions, do not admit such Hodge theoretic properties. In another joint paper from [[#CITREFDeningerSinghof2001b|2001]], they established a dynamical Lefschetz trace formula: it relates the trace of an operator on harmonic forms the local traces appearing at the closed orbits (on certain foliated spaces with an '''R'''-action). This result serves as a corroboration of Deninger's program mentioned above in the sense that it verifies a prediction made by this program on the analytic side, i.e., the one concerning dynamics on foliated spaces.\n\n===Entropy and Mahler measures===\n\nAnother group of Deninger's papers revolves around the space\n:<math>X_f := (\\mathbf Z \\Gamma / \\mathbf Z \\Gamma f)\\widehat{\\ }\\ , </math>\n\nwhere &Gamma; is a discrete group, ''f'' is an element of its [[group ring]] '''Z'''&Gamma;, and the hat denotes the [[Pontryagin dual]]. For &Gamma; = '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup> and <math>f \\in \\mathbb Z[x_1^{\\pm 1}, \\dots, x_n^{\\pm n}]</math>, {{harvtxt|Lind|Schmidt|Ward|1990}} had shown that the entropy of the &Gamma;-action on ''X''<sub>''f''</sub> is given by the [[Mahler measure]]\n\n:<math>m(f) := (2 \\pi i)^{-n} \\int_{\\mathbb R^n / \\Gamma} \\log |f(z_1, \\dots, z_n)| \\frac{ dz_1}{z_1} \\dots \\frac{ dz_n}{z_n}.</math>\n\nMoreover, it had been known that Mahler measures of certain polynomials were known to be expressible in terms of special values of certain L-functions. In [[#CITEREF\u20141997|1997]], Deninger observed that the integrand in the definition of the Mahler measure has a natural explanation in terms of Deligne cohomology. Using known cases of the Beilinson conjecture, he deduced that ''m''(''f'') is the image of the symbol {''f'', ''t''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''t''<sub>''n''</sub>} under the Beilinson regulator, where the variety is the complement in the ''n''-dimensional [[algebraic torus|torus]] of the zero set of ''f''. This led to a conceptual explanation for the afore-mentioned formulas for Mahler measures. {{harvtxt|Besser|Deninger|1999}} and Deninger later in [[#CITEREF\u20142009|2009]] carried over these ideas to the ''p''-adic world, by replacing the Beilinson regulator map to Deligne cohomology by a regulator map to [[syntomic cohomology]], and the logarithm appearing in the definition of the entropy by a [[p-adic logarithm|''p''-adic logarithm]].\n\nIn [[#CITEREF\u20142006|2006]] and [[#CITEREF\u2014Schmidt2007|2007]], Deninger and [[Klaus Schmidt (mathematician)|Klaus Schmidt]] pushed the parallel between entropy and Mahler measures beyond abelian groups, namely residually finite, countable discrete [[amenable group]]s &Gamma;. They showed that the &Gamma;-action on ''X''<sub>''f''</sub> is [[expansive action|expansive]] if and only if ''f'' is invertible in the ''L''<sup>1</sup>-[[convolution algebra]] of &Gamma;. Moreover, the logarithm of the [[Fuglede-Kadison determinant]] on the [[von Neumann algebra]] N&Gamma; associated to &Gamma; (which replaces the Mahler measure for '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup>) agrees with the [[entropy]] of the above action.\n\n===Witt vectors===\n[[Joachim Cuntz]] and Deninger worked together on [[Witt vector]]s. In two papers around 2014, they simplified the theory by giving a presentation of the ring of Witt vectors in terms of a completion of the [[monoid algebra]] '''Z'''''R''. This approach avoids the universal polynomials used in the classical definition of the addition of Witt vectors.\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n\n===Artin\u2013Verdier duality===\n* {{Citation|last1=Deninger|first1=Christopher|title=On Artin\u2013Verdier duality for function fields|journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift|year=1984|volume=188|issue=1|pages=91\u2013100|mr=767366|doi=10.1007/BF01163876}}\n*{{Citation|author=\u2014|title=An extension of Artin\u2013Verdier duality to nontorsion sheaves|journal=J.

She suffered a breakdown due to the deterioration of her father's health. After this she worked in a glassware shop. She eventually joined the [[J.

The [[Whitechapel Gallery]] exhibition of [[Jackson Pollock]] in the winter of 1958 had an impact on her.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nHer early work was figurative and semi-impressionist. Between 1958 and 1959, her work at the advertising agency showed her adoption of a style of painting based on the [[Pointillism|pointillist]] technique.<ref name=\"Bridget Riley\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=4929 Bridget Riley] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.</ref> Around 1960, she began to develop her signature [[Op Art]] style consisting of black and white geometric patterns that explore the dynamism of sight and produce a disorienting effect on the eye and produces movement and color.<ref name=\"Chilvers, Ian 2009. pp. 598-599\"/> In the summer of 1960, she toured Italy with her mentor Maurice de Sausmarez, and the two friends visited the [[Venice Biennale]] with its large exhibition of [[Futurism|Futurist]] works.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nEarly in her career, Riley worked as an art teacher for children from 1957\u201358 at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] (now known as ''Sacred Heart Language College''). At the Convent of the Sacred Heart, she began a basic design course.

They present a great variety of geometric forms that produce sensations of movement or colour. In the early 1960s, her works were said to induce sensation in viewers as varied as seasick and [[sky diving]]. From 1961 to 1964, she worked with the contrast of black and white, occasionally introducing tonal scales of grey. Works in this style comprised her first 1962 solo show at Musgrave's Gallery One, as well as numerous subsequent shows. For example, in ''Fall'', a single perpendiculars curve is repeated to create a field of varying optical frequencies.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/riley-fall-t00616  Bridget Riley, ''Fall'' (1963)] [[Tate]].</ref> Visually, these works relate to many concerns of the period: a perceived need for audience participation (this relates them to the [[Happening]]s, which were common in this era), challenges to the notion of the mind-body duality which led [[Aldous Huxley]] to experiment with [[hallucinogenic drugs]];<ref>[[Aldous Huxley|Huxley, Aldous]] (1954) ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Chatto and Windus, p. 15</ref> concerns with a tension between a scientific future which might be very beneficial or might lead to a [[nuclear war]]; and fears about the loss of genuine individual experience in a Brave New World.<ref>Introduction to Frances Follin, Embodied Visions: Bridget Riley, Op Art and the Sixties, Thames and Hudson 2004</ref> Her paintings since 1961, have been executed by assistants.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> She meticulously plans her composition's design with preparatory drawings and collage techniques; her assistants paint the final canvases with great precision under her instruction.<ref name=\"Practising Abstraction\">Practising Abstraction, Bridget Riley talking to Michael Craig-Martin in ''Bridget Riley, Dialogues on Art'', p. 62</ref>\n\nRiley began investigating colour in 1967, the year in which she produced her first stripe painting.<ref name=\"Tate Press Release\">{{cite web| url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/bridget-riley |title=Press Release: Bridget Riley |publisher=Tate Gallery | date=17 March 2003 |accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Following a major retrospective in the early 1970s, Riley began travelling extensively.

Towards the end of the 1980s, Riley's work underwent a dramatic change with the reintroduction of the diagonal in the form of a sequence of [[parallelogram]]s used to disrupt and animate the vertical stripes that had characterised her previous paintings.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5101424 Bridget Riley, ''August'' (1995)] [[Christie's]] Post-War & Contemporary Art Evening Sale, London, 30 June 2008.</ref> In ''Delos'' (1983), for example, blue, turquoise, and emerald hues alternate with rich yellows, reds and white.<ref>J\u00f6rg Heiser (May 2011), Bridget Riley at Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin, ''[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]]''.</ref>\n\n===Murals===\n[[File:Bridget-riley-bolt-of-colour-1-chinati-foundatin-marfa-texas.jpg|thumb|''Bolt of Colour'', 2017-2019.

It is his most precious possession, and, as Proust explains, the source of his innermost happiness. However, as can be seen from the practice of the great artists, although the text may be strong and durable and able to support a lifetime's work, it cannot be taken for granted and there is no guarantee of permanent possession. It may be mislaid or even lost, and retrieval is very difficult. It may lie dormant, and be discovered late in life after a long struggle, as with [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] or Proust himself. Why it should be that some people have this sort of text while others do not, and what 'meaning' it has, is not something which lends itself to argument. Nor is it up to the artist to decide how important it is, or what value it has for other people. To ascertain this is perhaps beyond even the capacities of an artist's own time.<ref name=\"Bracewell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1|title=Seeing is Believing|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|date=October 2008|publisher=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=15 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111073803/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1/|archivedate=11 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"pn\">{{cite journal|jstor=887465|last=Riley|first=Bridget|date=September 1997|title=Painting Now|journal=The Burlington Magazine|publisher=The Burlington Magazine Publications, Ltd.|volume=139|issue=1134|pages=616\u2013622}}</ref>}}\n\n===Writer and curator===\nRiley has written on artists from [[Nicolas Poussin]] to [[Bruce Nauman]].

Seitz); the exhibition which first drew worldwide attention to her work and the Op Art movement. Her painting ''Current'', 1964, was reproduced on the cover of the show's catalogue. Riley became increasingly disillusioned, however, with the exploitation of her art for commercial purposes, discovering that in the USA there was no copyright protection for artists. The first US copyright legislation was eventually passed, following an independent initiative by New York artists, in 1967.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nShe participated in [[documenta]]s IV (1968) and VI (1977).

She suffered a breakdown due to the deterioration of her father's health. After this she worked in a glassware shop. She eventually joined the [[J. Walter Thompson]] advertising agency, as an illustrator, where she worked part-time until 1962. The [[Whitechapel Gallery]] exhibition of [[Jackson Pollock]] in the winter of 1958 had an impact on her.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nHer early work was figurative and semi-impressionist. Between 1958 and 1959, her work at the advertising agency showed her adoption of a style of painting based on the [[Pointillism|pointillist]] technique.<ref name=\"Bridget Riley\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=4929 Bridget Riley] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.</ref> Around 1960, she began to develop her signature [[Op Art]] style consisting of black and white geometric patterns that explore the dynamism of sight and produce a disorienting effect on the eye and produces movement and color.<ref name=\"Chilvers, Ian 2009. pp. 598-599\"/> In the summer of 1960, she toured Italy with her mentor Maurice de Sausmarez, and the two friends visited the [[Venice Biennale]] with its large exhibition of [[Futurism|Futurist]] works.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nEarly in her career, Riley worked as an art teacher for children from 1957\u201358 at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] (now known as ''Sacred Heart Language College''). At the Convent of the Sacred Heart, she began a basic design course.

They present a great variety of geometric forms that produce sensations of movement or colour. In the early 1960s, her works were said to induce sensation in viewers as varied as seasick and [[sky diving]]. From 1961 to 1964, she worked with the contrast of black and white, occasionally introducing tonal scales of grey. Works in this style comprised her first 1962 solo show at Musgrave's Gallery One, as well as numerous subsequent shows. For example, in ''Fall'', a single perpendiculars curve is repeated to create a field of varying optical frequencies.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/riley-fall-t00616  Bridget Riley, ''Fall'' (1963)] [[Tate]].</ref> Visually, these works relate to many concerns of the period: a perceived need for audience participation (this relates them to the [[Happening]]s, which were common in this era), challenges to the notion of the mind-body duality which led [[Aldous Huxley]] to experiment with [[hallucinogenic drugs]];<ref>[[Aldous Huxley|Huxley, Aldous]] (1954) ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Chatto and Windus, p. 15</ref> concerns with a tension between a scientific future which might be very beneficial or might lead to a [[nuclear war]]; and fears about the loss of genuine individual experience in a Brave New World.<ref>Introduction to Frances Follin, Embodied Visions: Bridget Riley, Op Art and the Sixties, Thames and Hudson 2004</ref> Her paintings since 1961, have been executed by assistants.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> She meticulously plans her composition's design with preparatory drawings and collage techniques; her assistants paint the final canvases with great precision under her instruction.<ref name=\"Practising Abstraction\">Practising Abstraction, Bridget Riley talking to Michael Craig-Martin in ''Bridget Riley, Dialogues on Art'', p. 62</ref>\n\nRiley began investigating colour in 1967, the year in which she produced her first stripe painting.<ref name=\"Tate Press Release\">{{cite web| url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/bridget-riley |title=Press Release: Bridget Riley |publisher=Tate Gallery | date=17 March 2003 |accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Following a major retrospective in the early 1970s, Riley began travelling extensively.

In 1983, for the first time in fifteen years, Riley returned to Venice to once again study the paintings that form the basis of European colourism. Towards the end of the 1980s, Riley's work underwent a dramatic change with the reintroduction of the diagonal in the form of a sequence of [[parallelogram]]s used to disrupt and animate the vertical stripes that had characterised her previous paintings.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5101424 Bridget Riley, ''August'' (1995)] [[Christie's]] Post-War & Contemporary Art Evening Sale, London, 30 June 2008.</ref> In ''Delos'' (1983), for example, blue, turquoise, and emerald hues alternate with rich yellows, reds and white.<ref>J\u00f6rg Heiser (May 2011), Bridget Riley at Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin, ''[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]]''.</ref>\n\n===Murals===\n[[File:Bridget-riley-bolt-of-colour-1-chinati-foundatin-marfa-texas.jpg|thumb|''Bolt of Colour'', 2017-2019.

It is his most precious possession, and, as Proust explains, the source of his innermost happiness. However, as can be seen from the practice of the great artists, although the text may be strong and durable and able to support a lifetime's work, it cannot be taken for granted and there is no guarantee of permanent possession. It may be mislaid or even lost, and retrieval is very difficult. It may lie dormant, and be discovered late in life after a long struggle, as with [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] or Proust himself. Why it should be that some people have this sort of text while others do not, and what 'meaning' it has, is not something which lends itself to argument. Nor is it up to the artist to decide how important it is, or what value it has for other people. To ascertain this is perhaps beyond even the capacities of an artist's own time.<ref name=\"Bracewell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1|title=Seeing is Believing|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|date=October 2008|publisher=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=15 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111073803/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1/|archivedate=11 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"pn\">{{cite journal|jstor=887465|last=Riley|first=Bridget|date=September 1997|title=Painting Now|journal=The Burlington Magazine|publisher=The Burlington Magazine Publications, Ltd.|volume=139|issue=1134|pages=616\u2013622}}</ref>}}\n\n===Writer and curator===\nRiley has written on artists from [[Nicolas Poussin]] to [[Bruce Nauman]].

Seitz); the exhibition which first drew worldwide attention to her work and the Op Art movement. Her painting ''Current'', 1964, was reproduced on the cover of the show's catalogue. Riley became increasingly disillusioned, however, with the exploitation of her art for commercial purposes, discovering that in the USA there was no copyright protection for artists. The first US copyright legislation was eventually passed, following an independent initiative by New York artists, in 1967.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nShe participated in [[documenta]]s IV (1968) and VI (1977).

It has the inscription ''finlandi'' ([[Runestone G 319|G 319]]) and dates back to the 13th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arkisto.fi/ |title=National Archives Service, Finland (in English) |accessdate=22 January 2007}}</ref> The name can be assumed to be related to the tribe name ''[[Finnish tribes|Finns]]'', which is mentioned at first known time AD 98 (disputed meaning).\n\n=== Suomi ===\nThe name ''Suomi'' ({{Langnf|fi|2=Finnish|3=\"Finland\"}}) has uncertain origins, but a candidate for a source is the Proto-Baltic word ''*\u017aem\u0113'', meaning \"land\". In addition to the close relatives of Finnish (the [[Finnic languages]]), this name is also used in the [[Baltic languages]] [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. Alternatively, the Indo-European word *''g\u02b0m-on'' \"man\" (cf. Gothic ''guma'', Latin ''homo'') has been suggested, being borrowed as *''\u0107oma''. Earlier theories suggested derivation from ''suomaa'' ([[fen]] land) or ''suoniemi'' (fen cape), but these are now considered outdated.

The [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|YYA Treaty]] (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance) gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics. This was extensively exploited by president [[Urho Kekkonen]] against his opponents. He maintained an effective monopoly on Soviet relations from 1956 on, which was crucial for his continued popularity. In politics, there was a tendency of avoiding any policies and statements that could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. This phenomenon was given the name \"[[Finlandization]]\" by the West German press.\n\nDespite close relations with the Soviet Union, Finland maintained a market economy. Various industries benefited from [[Bilateral trade|trade privileges]] with the Soviets, which explains the widespread support that pro-Soviet policies enjoyed among business interests in Finland. Economic growth was rapid in the postwar era, and by 1975 Finland's GDP per capita was the 15th-highest in the world. In the 1970s and '80s, Finland built one of the most extensive [[welfare state]]s in the world. Finland negotiated with the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC, a predecessor of the European Union) a treaty that mostly abolished customs duties towards the EEC starting from 1977, although Finland did not fully join. In 1981, President Urho Kekkonen's failing health forced him to retire after holding office for 25 years.\n\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|Finland joined the European Union in 1995 and signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007]]\n\nFinland reacted cautiously to the collapse of the Soviet Union, but swiftly began increasing integration with the West.

Of world capitals, only [[Reykjav\u00edk]] lies more to the north than [[Helsinki]]. The distance from the southernmost point \u2013 [[Hanko]] in Uusimaa \u2013 to the northernmost \u2013 [[Nuorgam]] in Lapland \u2013 is {{convert|1160|km|mi}}.\n\nFinland has about 168,000 lakes (of area larger than {{convert|500|m2|acre|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and 179,000 islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_alue_en.html |title=Statistics Finland, Environment and Natural Resources|accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref> Its largest lake, [[Saimaa]], is the fourth largest in Europe. The [[Finnish Lakeland]] is the area with the most lakes in the country. The greatest concentration of islands is found in the southwest, in the [[Archipelago Sea]] between continental Finland and the main island of \u00c5land.\n\nMuch of the geography of Finland is a result of the Ice Age. The glaciers were thicker and lasted longer in [[Fennoscandia]] compared with the rest of Europe. Their eroding effects have left the Finnish landscape mostly flat with few hills and fewer mountains. Its highest point, the [[Halti]] at {{convert|1324|m|ft|0}}, is found in the extreme north of Lapland at the border between Finland and [[Norway]]. The highest mountain whose peak is entirely in Finland is [[Ridnit\u0161ohkka]] at 1,316&nbsp;m (4,318&nbsp;ft), directly adjacent to Halti.\n\n[[File:Cygnus cygnus from zh.JPG|thumb|The [[whooper swan]], Finland's [[List of national birds|national bird]]]]\n\nThe retreating glaciers have left the land with [[moraine|morainic]] deposits in formations of [[esker]]s. These are ridges of stratified gravel and sand, running northwest to southeast, where the ancient edge of the glacier once lay. Among the biggest of these are the three [[Salpausselk\u00e4]] ridges that run across southern Finland.\n\nHaving been compressed under the enormous weight of the glaciers, terrain in Finland is rising due to the [[post-glacial rebound]]. The effect is strongest around the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], where land steadily rises about {{convert|1|cm|1|abbr=on}} a year. As a result, the old sea bottom turns little by little into dry land: the surface area of the country is expanding by about {{convert|7|km2|sqmi}} annually.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fimr.fi/en/tutkimus/fysikaalinen-tutkimus/vedenkorkeuden-vaihteluiden-ajalliset-muutokset.html |title=Trends in sea level variability |work=Finnish Institute of Marine Research |date=24 August 2004 |accessdate=22 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227172733/http://www.fimr.fi/en/tutkimus/fysikaalinen-tutkimus/vedenkorkeuden-vaihteluiden-ajalliset-muutokset.html |archivedate=27 February 2007 }}</ref> Relatively speaking, Finland is rising from the sea.<ref name=\"EB\">\"Finland.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

[[Gleysol]]s and peat [[bog]]s occupy poorly drained areas.\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n{{Main|Fauna of Finland|Wildlife of Finland}}\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Finland is shared between the Arctic, central European, and northern European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Finland can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Scandinavian and Russian taiga]], [[Sarmatic mixed forests]], and [[Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands]]. Taiga covers most of Finland from northern regions of southern provinces to the north of Lapland. On the southwestern coast, south of the Helsinki-[[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]] line, forests are characterized by mixed forests, that are more typical in the Baltic region. In the extreme north of Finland, near the [[tree line]] and Arctic Ocean, Montane Birch forests are common.\n\n[[File:\u00c4ht\u00e4rin karhut 7.jpg|thumb|The [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos'') is Finland's national animal.]]\nSimilarly, Finland has a diverse and extensive range of fauna. There are at least sixty native [[mammal]]ian species, 248 breeding bird species, over 70 fish species, and 11 reptile and frog species present today, many migrating from neighboring countries thousands of years ago.\nLarge and widely recognized wildlife mammals found in Finland are the [[brown bear]] (the national animal), [[gray wolf]], [[wolverine]], and [[Moose|elk]]. Three of the more striking birds are the [[whooper swan]], a large European swan and the national bird of Finland; the [[Western capercaillie]], a large, black-plumaged member of the [[grouse]] family; and the [[Eurasian eagle-owl]].

In the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], the whole of Finland lies in the [[subarctic climate|boreal zone]], characterized by warm summers and freezing winters. Within the country, the [[temperateness]] varies considerably between the southern coastal regions and the extreme north, showing characteristics of both a [[Oceanic climate|maritime]] and a [[continental climate]]. Finland is near enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be continuously warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]].

The regions are governed by regional councils which serve as forums of cooperation for the [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]] of a region. The main tasks of the regions are regional planning and development of enterprise and education. In addition, the public health services are usually organized on the basis of regions. Currently, the only region where a popular election is held for the council is Kainuu. Other regional councils are elected by municipal councils, each municipality sending representatives in proportion to its population.\n\nIn addition to inter-municipal cooperation, which is the responsibility of regional councils, each region has a state Employment and Economic Development Centre which is responsible for the local administration of labour, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and entrepreneurial affairs. The [[Finnish Defence Forces]] regional offices are responsible for the regional defence preparations and for the administration of conscription within the region.\n\nRegions represent dialectal, cultural, and economic variations better than the former [[Provinces of Finland|provinces]], which were purely administrative divisions of the central government. Historically, regions are divisions of [[historical provinces of Finland]], areas which represent dialects and culture more accurately.\n\nSix [[Regional State Administrative Agencies of Finland|Regional State Administrative Agencies]] were created by the state of Finland in 2010, each of them responsible for one of the regions called {{lang|fi|alue}} in Finnish and {{lang|sv|region}} in Swedish; in addition, \u00c5land was designated a seventh region.

Municipalities co-operate in seventy [[Sub-regions of Finland|sub-regions]] and nineteen [[Regions of Finland|regions]]. These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers. The autonomous province of \u00c5land has a permanent democratically elected regional council.

Finland|Human rights in Finland}}\n[[File:BlueEurozone.svg|thumb|Finland is a member of:<br/>\n{{legend2|#039|the [[Eurozone]]}}\n{{legend2|#039}}{{legend2|#36C|the [[European Union]]}}]]\n\n=== Constitution ===\nThe [[Constitution of Finland]] defines the political system; Finland is a [[parliamentary republic]] within the framework of a [[representative democracy]]. The [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] is the country's most powerful person. The current version of the constitution was enacted on 1 March 2000, and was amended on 1 March 2012. Citizens can run and vote in parliamentary, municipal, presidential and [[Elections in the European Union|European Union elections]].\n\n=== President ===\n{{Main|President of Finland}}\nThe [[head of state]] of Finland is [[President of Finland|President of the Republic of Finland]] (in Finnish: ''Suomen tasavallan presidentti''; in Swedish: ''Republiken Finlands president''). Finland has had for most of its independence a [[semi-presidential system]], but in the last few decades the powers of the President have been diminished. In constitution amendments, which came into effect in 1991 or 1992 and also with a new drafted constitution of 2000, amended in 2012, the President's position has become primarily a ceremonial office. However, the President still leads the nation's foreign politics together with the Council of State and is the commander-in-chief of the Defence Forces.<ref name=\"Parliamentary\">Formerly a semi-presidential republic, it is now a parliamentary republic according to David Arter, First Chair of Politics at Aberdeen University. In his \"Scandinavian Politics Today\" (Manchester University Press, revised 2008 {{ISBN|9780719078538}}), he quotes {{Cite journal |last=Nousiainen |first=Jaakko |date=June 2001 |title=From semi-presidentialism to parliamentary government: political and constitutional developments in Finland |journal=[[Scandinavian Political Studies]] |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=95\u2013109 |doi=10.1111/1467-9477.00048 |ref=harv}} as follows: \"There are hardly any grounds for the epithet 'semi-presidential'.\" Arter's own conclusions are only slightly more nuanced: \"The adoption of a new constitution on 1 March 2000 meant that Finland was no longer a case of semi-presidential government other than in the minimalist sense of a situation where a popularly elected fixed-term president exists alongside a prime minister and cabinet who are responsible to parliament (Elgie 2004: 317)\". According to the Finnish Constitution, the president has no possibility to rule the government without the ministerial approval, and does not have the power to dissolve the parliament under his or her own desire. Finland is actually represented by its prime minister, and not by its president, in the Council of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union. The 2012 constitutional amendments reduced the powers of the president even further.</ref> The position still does entail some powers, including responsibility for [[Foreign relations of Finland|foreign policy]] (excluding affairs related to the [[European Union]]) in cooperation with the [[Finnish Government|cabinet]], being [[Commander-in-Chief|the head of the armed forces]], some decree and pardoning powers, and some appointive powers. Direct, one- or two-stage elections are used to elect the president for a term of six years and for a maximum of two consecutive terms. The current president is [[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]]; he took office on 1 March 2012. Former presidents were [[Kaarlo Juho St\u00e5hlberg|K. J. St\u00e5hlberg]] (1919\u20131925), [[Lauri Kristian Relander|L. K. Relander]] (1925\u20131931), [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud|P. E. Svinhufvud]] (1931\u20131937), [[Ky\u00f6sti Kallio]] (1937\u20131940), [[Risto Ryti]] (1940\u20131944), [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|C. G. E. Mannerheim]] (1944\u20131946), [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|J. K. Paasikivi]] (1946\u20131956), [[Urho Kekkonen]] (1956\u20131982), [[Mauno Koivisto]] (1982\u20131994), [[Martti Ahtisaari]] (1994\u20132000), and [[Tarja Halonen]] (2000\u20132012)<!-- don't add Sauli Niinist\u00f6 here, because he is not a former president -->.\n\nThe current president was elected from the ranks of the [[National Coalition Party]] for the first time since 1946. The presidency between 1946 and the present was instead held by a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] or the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]].\n\n=== Parliament ===\n{{Main|Parliament of Finland}}\n[[File:Eduskuntatalo Helsinki.jpg|thumb|The [[Parliament of Finland]]'s main building]]\n\nThe 200-member [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Parliament of Finland]] ({{Lang-fi|Eduskunta}}, {{Lang-sv|Riksdag}}) exercises supreme legislative authority in the country. It may alter the constitution and ordinary laws, dismiss the cabinet, and override presidential vetoes. Its acts are not subject to judicial review; the constitutionality of new laws is assessed by the parliament's [[Parliament of Finland#Committees|constitutional law committee]]. The parliament is elected for a term of four years using the proportional [[D'Hondt method]] within a number of multi-seat constituencies through the [[Open list#Most open|most open list]] multi-member districts. Various parliament committees listen to experts and prepare legislation. The [[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|speaker of the parliament]] is [[Paula Risikko]] ([[National Coalition]]).<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.eduskunta.fi/EN/tiedotteet/Pages/speaker-risikko-elected.aspx| title = Paula Risikko Elected as New Speaker of Parliament |publisher = [[Parliament of Finland|Eduskunta]]| author =| accessdate = 24 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince [[universal suffrage]] was introduced in 1906, the parliament has been dominated by the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] (former Agrarian Union), the [[National Coalition Party]], and the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]]. These parties have enjoyed approximately equal support, and their combined vote has totalled about 65\u201380% of all votes. Their lowest common total of MPs, 121, was reached in the 2011 elections. For a few decades after 1944, the [[Communist Party of Finland|Communists]] were a strong fourth party. Due to the electoral system of proportional representation, and the relative reluctance of voters to switch their support between parties, the relative strengths of the parties have commonly varied only slightly from one election to another. However, there have been some long-term trends, such as the rise and fall of the Communists during the Cold War; the steady decline into insignificance of the [[Liberals (Finland)|Liberals]] and its predecessors from 1906 to 1980; and the rise of the [[Green League]] since 1983. In the 2011 elections, the [[True Finns|Finns Party]] achieved exceptional success, increasing its representation from 5 to 39 seats, surpassing the Centre Party.<ref>The source for historical information on party support is [[:fi:Suomen eduskunta#Kansanedustajat puolueittain ja vaaleittain|the Finnish Wikipedia's article on the parliament]]</ref>\n\nThe autonomous province of \u00c5land, which forms a [[federacy]] with Finland, elects one member to the parliament, who traditionally joins the [[parliamentary group]] of the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]]. (The province also holds elections for its own permanent [[Parliament of \u00c5land|regional council]], and in the [[2011 \u00c5land legislative election|2011 elections]], [[\u00c5land Centre]] was the largest party.)\n\nThe Parliament can be dissolved by a recommendation of the Prime Minister, endorsed by the President. This procedure has never been used, although the parliament was dissolved eight times under the pre-2000 constitution, when this action was the sole prerogative of the president.\n\nAfter the [[2015 Finnish parliamentary election|parliamentary elections on 19 April 2015]], the seats were divided among eight parties as follows:<ref>{{cite web| url = http://vaalit.yle.fi/tulospalvelu/2015/eduskuntavaalit/?puolueet_##taulukko| title = Eduskuntavaalit 2015 \u2013 tulospalvelu \u2013 yle.fi| publisher = [[Yle]]| author =| accessdate = 5 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The cabinet can be dismissed by a parliamentary vote of no confidence, although this rarely happens (the last time in 1957), as the parties represented in the cabinet usually make up a majority in the parliament.<ref>[[:fi:Ep\u00e4luottamuslause|The Finnish Wikipedia's article on Motion of no confidence]]</ref>\n\nThe cabinet exercises most executive powers, and originates most of the bills that the parliament then debates and votes on. It is headed by the [[Prime Minister of Finland]], and consists of him or her, of other ministers, and of the [[Chancellor of Justice#Finland|Chancellor of Justice]]. The current prime minister is [[Sanna Marin]] (Social Democratic Party). Each minister heads his or her ministry, or, in some cases, has responsibility for a subset of a ministry's policy. After the prime minister, the most powerful minister is the [[Minister of Finance (Finland)|minister of finance]]. The incumbent Minister of Finance is [[Katri Kulmuni]].\n\nAs no one party ever dominates the parliament, Finnish cabinets are multi-party coalitions. As a rule, the post of prime minister goes to the leader of the biggest party and that of the minister of finance to the leader of the second biggest.\n\n=== Law ===\n{{Main|Law of Finland|Judicial system of Finland}}\n[[File:Supreme Court of Finland.jpg|thumb|right|The Court House of the [[Supreme Court of Finland|Supreme Court]]]]\nThe judicial system of Finland is a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system divided between [[court]]s with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and [[administrative court]]s with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Finnish law is codified and based on [[Judiciary of Sweden|Swedish law]] and in a wider sense, civil law or [[Roman law]]. The court system for civil and criminal jurisdiction consists of local courts (''k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus'', ''tingsr\u00e4tt''), regional appellate courts (''hovioikeus'', ''hovr\u00e4tt''), and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] (''korkein oikeus'', ''h\u00f6gsta domstolen''). The administrative branch of justice consists of administrative courts (''hallinto-oikeus'', ''f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstol'') and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Administrative Court|Supreme Administrative Court]] (''korkein hallinto-oikeus'', ''h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen''). In addition to the regular courts, there are a few special courts in certain branches of administration. There is also a [[Judicial system of Finland#High Court of Impeachment|High Court of Impeachment]] for criminal charges against certain high-ranking officeholders.\n\nAround 92% of residents have confidence in Finland's security institutions.<ref name=\"corruptionpolicing\">Policing corruption, International Perspectives.</ref> The overall [[Crime in Finland|crime rate of Finland]] is not high in the EU context.

Since the 1980s the social security has been cut back, but still the system is one of the most comprehensive in the world. Created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II, the social security system was an outgrowth of the traditional Nordic belief that the state was not inherently hostile to the well-being of its citizens, but could intervene benevolently on their behalf. According to some social historians, the basis of this belief was a relatively benign history that had allowed the gradual emergence of a free and independent peasantry in the Nordic countries and had curtailed the dominance of the nobility and the subsequent formation of a powerful right wing. Finland's history has been harsher than the histories of the other Nordic countries, but not harsh enough to bar the country from following their path of social development.<ref name=\"LOC\">Text from PD source: US Library of Congress: ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/fitoc.html A Country Study: Finland]'', Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990.</ref>\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Finnish Defence Forces|Military history of Finland}}\n{{See also|List of wars involving Finland}}\n\nThe Finnish Defence Forces consist of a [[En cadre|cadre]] of professional soldiers (mainly officers and technical personnel), currently serving conscripts, and a large reserve. The standard readiness strength is 34,700 people in uniform, of which 25% are professional soldiers. A universal male [[conscription]] is in place, under which all male Finnish nationals above 18 years of age serve for 6 to 12 months of armed service or 12 months of civilian (non-armed) service.\nVoluntary post-conscription overseas peacekeeping service is popular, and troops serve around the world in UN, NATO, and EU missions. Approximately 500 women choose voluntary military service every year.<ref>[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naisten_vapaaehtoinen_asepalvelus.dsp Women's voluntary service] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409182820/http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naisten_vapaaehtoinen_asepalvelus.dsp |date=9 April 2008 }} (in Finnish)</ref> Women are allowed to serve in all combat arms including front-line infantry and special forces.\nThe army consists of a highly mobile field army backed up by local defence units.

The country lies between the latitudes 60\u00b0N and 70\u00b0N, and it has severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frost. However, because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current moderate the climate, Finland contains half of the world's arable land north of 60\u00b0 north latitude. Annual precipitation is usually sufficient, but it occurs almost exclusively during the winter months, making summer droughts a constant threat. In response to the climate, farmers have relied on quick-ripening and frost-resistant varieties of crops, and they have cultivated south-facing slopes as well as richer bottomlands to ensure production even in years with summer frosts. Most farmland was originally either forest or swamp, and the soil has usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralize excess acid and to improve fertility. Irrigation has generally not been necessary, but drainage systems are often needed to remove excess water. Finland's agriculture has been efficient and productive\u2014at least when compared with farming in other European countries.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nForests play a key role in the country's economy, making it one of the world's leading wood producers and providing raw materials at competitive prices for the crucial wood-processing industries. As in agriculture, the government has long played a leading role in forestry, regulating tree cutting, sponsoring technical improvements, and establishing long-term plans to ensure that the country's forests continue to supply the wood-processing industries. To maintain the country's comparative advantage in forest products, Finnish authorities moved to raise lumber output toward the country's ecological limits. In 1984, the government published the Forest 2000 plan, drawn up by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The plan aimed at increasing forest harvests by about 3% per year, while conserving forestland for recreation and other uses.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nPrivate sector employees amount to 1.8 million, out of which around a third with tertiary education.

Initially, most development was based on two broad groups of export-led industries, the \"metal industry\" (''metalliteollisuus'') and \"forest industry\" (''mets\u00e4teollisuus''). The \"metal industry\" includes shipbuilding, metalworking, the car industry, engineered products such as motors and electronics, and production of metals (steel, copper and chromium). The world's biggest [[cruise ship]]s are built in Finnish shipyards. The \"forest industry\" includes forestry, timber, pulp and paper, and is a logical development based on Finland's extensive forest resources (77% of the area is covered by forest, most of it in renewable use). In the [[pulp and paper industry]], many of the largest companies are based in Finland ([[Ahlstrom]], [[Mets\u00e4 Board]], and [[UPM (company)|UPM]]). However, the Finnish economy has diversified, with expansion into fields such as electronics (e.g. [[Nokia]]), metrology ([[Vaisala]]), transport fuels ([[Neste]]), chemicals ([[Kemira]]), engineering consulting ([[P\u00f6yry]]), and information technology (e.g. [[Rovio Entertainment]], known for [[Angry Birds]]), and is no longer dominated by the two sectors of metal and forest industry. Likewise, the structure has changed, with the service sector growing, with manufacturing reducing in importance; agriculture is only a minor part. Despite this, production for export is still more prominent than in Western Europe, thus making Finland more vulnerable to global economic trends.\n\nIn an [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] report released in September 2011, Finland clinched the second place after the United States on Benchmarking IT Industry Competitiveness 2011 which scored on 6 key indicators: overall business environment, technology infrastructure, human capital, legal framework, public support for industry development, and research and development landscape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/seasia/singapore-tops-it-competitiveness-in-asia-pacific-ranks-no-3-worldwide/468002 |title=Singapore Tops IT Competitiveness in Asia Pacific, Ranks No. 3 Worldwide |date=27 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220204542/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/seasia/singapore-tops-it-competitiveness-in-asia-pacific-ranks-no-3-worldwide/468002 |archivedate=20 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Public policy ===\n{{See also|Nordic model}}\n\nFinnish politicians have often emulated other Nordics and the Nordic model.<ref name=\"nordicmodel\">[http://www.etla.fi/files/1892_the_nordic_model_complete.pdf The Nordic Model] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905212132/http://www.etla.fi/files/1892_the_nordic_model_complete.pdf |date=5 September 2012 }} by Torben M.

There are many attractions in Finland which attracted over 8 million visitors in 2013.\n\nThe Finnish landscape is covered with thick [[pine]] forests and rolling hills, and complemented with a labyrinth of lakes and [[inlet]]s.

Wildlife is abundant in Finland. [[Bird-watching]] is popular for those fond of avifauna, however hunting is also popular. [[Moose|Elk]] and [[hare]] are common game in Finland.

Many writers of the national awakening wrote in Swedish, such as the national poet [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]] and [[Zachris Topelius]].\n\nAfter Finland became independent, there was a rise of [[Modernist literature|modernist writers]], most famously the Finnish-speaking [[Mika Waltari]] and Swedish-speaking [[Edith S\u00f6dergran]]. [[Frans Eemil Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1939. World War II prompted a return to more national interests in comparison to a more international line of thought, characterized by [[V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linna]]. Besides Kalevala and Waltari, the Swedish-speaking [[Tove Jansson]] is the most translated Finnish writer. <!--Pure opinion?: Literature in modern Finland is in a healthy state.--> Popular modern writers include [[Arto Paasilinna]], [[Ilkka Remes]], [[Kari Hotakainen]], [[Sofi Oksanen]], and [[Jari Tervo]], while the best novel is annually awarded the prestigious [[Finlandia Prize]].\n[[File:Sammon puolustus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]], ''[[The Defense of the Sampo]]'', 1896, [[Turku Art Museum]]]]\n\n=== Visual arts, design, and architecture ===\n{{See also|Architecture of Finland|Art in Finland}}\nThe visual arts in Finland started to form their individual characteristics in the 19th century, when Romantic nationalism was rising in autonomic Finland. The best known of Finnish painters, [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]], started painting in a naturalist style, but moved to national romanticism. Finland's best-known sculptor of the 20th century was [[W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen]], remembered for his monumental [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] and sculptures. Finns have made major contributions to [[handicraft]]s and [[industrial design]]: among the internationally renowned figures are [[Timo Sarpaneva]], [[Tapio Wirkkala]] and [[Ilmari Tapiovaara]]. Finnish architecture is famous around the world, and has contributed significantly to several styles internationally, such as [[Jugendstil]] (or [[Art Nouveau]]), [[Nordic Classicism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]]. Among the top 20th-century Finnish architects to gain international recognition are [[Eliel Saarinen]] and his son [[Eero Saarinen]]. Architect [[Alvar Aalto]] is regarded as among the most important 20th-century designers in the world;<ref>James Stevens Curl, ''Dictionary of Architecture'', Grange Books, Rochester, 2005, p. 1.</ref> he helped bring [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist architecture]] to Finland, but soon was a pioneer in its development towards an organic style.<ref>Sigfried Giedion, ''Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2nd edition, 1949.</ref> Aalto is also famous for his work in furniture, lamps, textiles and [[glassware]], which were usually incorporated into his buildings.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Finland|Rock music in Finland|Sami music}}\n[[File:Jean Sibelius, 1913.jpg|thumb|upright|The Finnish composer [[Jean Sibelius]] (1865\u20131957), a significant figure in the history of [[European classical music|classical music]]]]\n;Classical\nMuch of Finland's classical music is influenced by traditional Karelian melodies and lyrics, as comprised in the ''[[Kalevala]]''. Karelian culture is perceived as the purest expression of the [[Baltic Finns|Finnic]] myths and beliefs, less influenced by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] influence than the [[Nordic folk dance music]] that largely replaced the kalevaic tradition. Finnish [[folk music]] has undergone a [[roots revival]] in recent decades, and has become a part of [[popular music]].\n\nThe people of northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway, the [[Sami people|Sami]], are known primarily for highly spiritual songs called [[joik]]. The same word sometimes refers to [[lavlu]] or vuelie songs, though this is technically incorrect.\n\nThe first Finnish opera was written by the German-born composer [[Fredrik Pacius]] in 1852. Pacius also wrote the music to the poem [[Maamme|''Maamme/V\u00e5rt land'' (Our Country)]], Finland's [[national anthem]]. In the 1890s Finnish nationalism based on the ''Kalevala'' spread, and [[Jean Sibelius]] became famous for his vocal symphony ''[[Kullervo (Sibelius)|Kullervo]]''. He soon received a grant to study ''runo singers'' in Karelia and continued his rise as the first prominent Finnish musician. In 1899 he composed ''[[Finlandia]]'', which played its important role in Finland gaining independence. He remains one of Finland's most popular national figures and is a symbol of the nation.\n\nToday, Finland has a very lively classical music scene and many of Finland's important [[List of Finnish composers|composers]] are still alive, such as [[Magnus Lindberg (Finnish composer)|Magnus Lindberg]], [[Kaija Saariaho]], [[Kalevi Aho]], and [[Aulis Sallinen]]. The composers are accompanied by a large number of great conductors such as [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]], [[Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4]], [[Jukka-Pekka Saraste]], and [[Leif Segerstam]]. Some of the internationally acclaimed Finnish classical musicians are [[Karita Mattila]], [[Soile Isokoski]], [[Pekka Kuusisto]], [[Olli Mustonen]], and [[Linda Brava|Linda Lampenius]].\n\n;Modern\n[[File:Apocalyptica1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Perttu Kivilaakso]] of [[Apocalyptica]]]]\n''Iskelm\u00e4'' (coined directly from the German word ''[[Schlager]]'', meaning \"hit\") is a traditional Finnish word for a light popular song. Finnish popular music also includes various kinds of [[dance music]]; [[Tango music|tango]], a style of [[Music of Argentina|Argentine music]], is also popular. The light music in Swedish-speaking areas has more influences from Sweden. Modern Finnish popular music includes a number of prominent rock bands, [[jazz]] musicians, [[hip hop]] performers, dance music acts, etc.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nDuring the early 1960s, the first significant wave of Finnish rock groups emerged, playing [[instrumental rock]] inspired by groups such as [[The Shadows]]. Around 1964, [[Beatlemania]] arrived in Finland, resulting in further development of the local rock scene. During the late 1960s and '70s, Finnish rock musicians increasingly wrote their own music instead of translating international hits into Finnish. During the decade, some [[progressive rock]] groups such as [[Tasavallan Presidentti]] and [[Wigwam (Finnish band)|Wigwam]] gained respect abroad but failed to make a commercial breakthrough outside Finland. This was also the fate of the [[rock and roll]] group [[Hurriganes]]. The Finnish punk scene produced some internationally acknowledged names including [[Terveet K\u00e4det]] in the 1980s. [[Hanoi Rocks]] was a pioneering 1980s [[glam rock]] act that inspired the American [[hard rock]] group [[Guns N' Roses]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304587704577333813382925678|title=Guns N' Roses Can Agree on at Least One Thing: This Finnish Saxophonist Rocks |last=Shah|first=Neil|date=15 April 2012|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany Finnish metal bands have gained international recognition.

In addition to the close relatives of Finnish (the [[Finnic languages]]), this name is also used in the [[Baltic languages]] [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]].

Finland took part in trade liberalization in the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]].\n\nOfficially claiming to be [[Neutral country|neutral]], Finland lay in the grey zone between the [[Western world|Western countries]] and the Soviet Union. The [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|YYA Treaty]] (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance) gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics. This was extensively exploited by president [[Urho Kekkonen]] against his opponents. He maintained an effective monopoly on Soviet relations from 1956 on, which was crucial for his continued popularity. In politics, there was a tendency of avoiding any policies and statements that could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. This phenomenon was given the name \"[[Finlandization]]\" by the West German press.\n\nDespite close relations with the Soviet Union, Finland maintained a market economy. Various industries benefited from [[Bilateral trade|trade privileges]] with the Soviets, which explains the widespread support that pro-Soviet policies enjoyed among business interests in Finland. Economic growth was rapid in the postwar era, and by 1975 Finland's GDP per capita was the 15th-highest in the world. In the 1970s and '80s, Finland built one of the most extensive [[welfare state]]s in the world. Finland negotiated with the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC, a predecessor of the European Union) a treaty that mostly abolished customs duties towards the EEC starting from 1977, although Finland did not fully join. In 1981, President Urho Kekkonen's failing health forced him to retire after holding office for 25 years.\n\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|Finland joined the European Union in 1995 and signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007]]\n\nFinland reacted cautiously to the collapse of the Soviet Union, but swiftly began increasing integration with the West.

Of world capitals, only [[Reykjav\u00edk]] lies more to the north than [[Helsinki]]. The distance from the southernmost point \u2013 [[Hanko]] in Uusimaa \u2013 to the northernmost \u2013 [[Nuorgam]] in Lapland \u2013 is {{convert|1160|km|mi}}.\n\nFinland has about 168,000 lakes (of area larger than {{convert|500|m2|acre|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and 179,000 islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_alue_en.html |title=Statistics Finland, Environment and Natural Resources|accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref> Its largest lake, [[Saimaa]], is the fourth largest in Europe. The [[Finnish Lakeland]] is the area with the most lakes in the country. The greatest concentration of islands is found in the southwest, in the [[Archipelago Sea]] between continental Finland and the main island of \u00c5land.\n\nMuch of the geography of Finland is a result of the Ice Age. The glaciers were thicker and lasted longer in [[Fennoscandia]] compared with the rest of Europe. Their eroding effects have left the Finnish landscape mostly flat with few hills and fewer mountains. Its highest point, the [[Halti]] at {{convert|1324|m|ft|0}}, is found in the extreme north of Lapland at the border between Finland and [[Norway]]. The highest mountain whose peak is entirely in Finland is [[Ridnit\u0161ohkka]] at 1,316&nbsp;m (4,318&nbsp;ft), directly adjacent to Halti.\n\n[[File:Cygnus cygnus from zh.JPG|thumb|The [[whooper swan]], Finland's [[List of national birds|national bird]]]]\n\nThe retreating glaciers have left the land with [[moraine|morainic]] deposits in formations of [[esker]]s. These are ridges of stratified gravel and sand, running northwest to southeast, where the ancient edge of the glacier once lay. Among the biggest of these are the three [[Salpausselk\u00e4]] ridges that run across southern Finland.\n\nHaving been compressed under the enormous weight of the glaciers, terrain in Finland is rising due to the [[post-glacial rebound]]. The effect is strongest around the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], where land steadily rises about {{convert|1|cm|1|abbr=on}} a year. As a result, the old sea bottom turns little by little into dry land: the surface area of the country is expanding by about {{convert|7|km2|sqmi}} annually.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fimr.fi/en/tutkimus/fysikaalinen-tutkimus/vedenkorkeuden-vaihteluiden-ajalliset-muutokset.html |title=Trends in sea level variability |work=Finnish Institute of Marine Research |date=24 August 2004 |accessdate=22 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227172733/http://www.fimr.fi/en/tutkimus/fysikaalinen-tutkimus/vedenkorkeuden-vaihteluiden-ajalliset-muutokset.html |archivedate=27 February 2007 }}</ref> Relatively speaking, Finland is rising from the sea.<ref name=\"EB\">\"Finland.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Finland can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Scandinavian and Russian taiga]], [[Sarmatic mixed forests]], and [[Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands]]. Taiga covers most of Finland from northern regions of southern provinces to the north of Lapland. On the southwestern coast, south of the Helsinki-[[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]] line, forests are characterized by mixed forests, that are more typical in the Baltic region. In the extreme north of Finland, near the [[tree line]] and Arctic Ocean, Montane Birch forests are common.\n\n[[File:\u00c4ht\u00e4rin karhut 7.jpg|thumb|The [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos'') is Finland's national animal.]]\nSimilarly, Finland has a diverse and extensive range of fauna. There are at least sixty native [[mammal]]ian species, 248 breeding bird species, over 70 fish species, and 11 reptile and frog species present today, many migrating from neighboring countries thousands of years ago.\nLarge and widely recognized wildlife mammals found in Finland are the [[brown bear]] (the national animal), [[gray wolf]], [[wolverine]], and [[Moose|elk]]. Three of the more striking birds are the [[whooper swan]], a large European swan and the national bird of Finland; the [[Western capercaillie]], a large, black-plumaged member of the [[grouse]] family; and the [[Eurasian eagle-owl]].

The regions are governed by regional councils which serve as forums of cooperation for the [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]] of a region. The main tasks of the regions are regional planning and development of enterprise and education. In addition, the public health services are usually organized on the basis of regions. Currently, the only region where a popular election is held for the council is Kainuu. Other regional councils are elected by municipal councils, each municipality sending representatives in proportion to its population.\n\nIn addition to inter-municipal cooperation, which is the responsibility of regional councils, each region has a state Employment and Economic Development Centre which is responsible for the local administration of labour, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and entrepreneurial affairs. The [[Finnish Defence Forces]] regional offices are responsible for the regional defence preparations and for the administration of conscription within the region.\n\nRegions represent dialectal, cultural, and economic variations better than the former [[Provinces of Finland|provinces]], which were purely administrative divisions of the central government. Historically, regions are divisions of [[historical provinces of Finland]], areas which represent dialects and culture more accurately.\n\nSix [[Regional State Administrative Agencies of Finland|Regional State Administrative Agencies]] were created by the state of Finland in 2010, each of them responsible for one of the regions called {{lang|fi|alue}} in Finnish and {{lang|sv|region}} in Swedish; in addition, \u00c5land was designated a seventh region.

Finland|Human rights in Finland}}\n[[File:BlueEurozone.svg|thumb|Finland is a member of:<br/>\n{{legend2|#039|the [[Eurozone]]}}\n{{legend2|#039}}{{legend2|#36C|the [[European Union]]}}]]\n\n=== Constitution ===\nThe [[Constitution of Finland]] defines the political system; Finland is a [[parliamentary republic]] within the framework of a [[representative democracy]]. The [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] is the country's most powerful person. The current version of the constitution was enacted on 1 March 2000, and was amended on 1 March 2012. Citizens can run and vote in parliamentary, municipal, presidential and [[Elections in the European Union|European Union elections]].\n\n=== President ===\n{{Main|President of Finland}}\nThe [[head of state]] of Finland is [[President of Finland|President of the Republic of Finland]] (in Finnish: ''Suomen tasavallan presidentti''; in Swedish: ''Republiken Finlands president''). Finland has had for most of its independence a [[semi-presidential system]], but in the last few decades the powers of the President have been diminished. In constitution amendments, which came into effect in 1991 or 1992 and also with a new drafted constitution of 2000, amended in 2012, the President's position has become primarily a ceremonial office. However, the President still leads the nation's foreign politics together with the Council of State and is the commander-in-chief of the Defence Forces.<ref name=\"Parliamentary\">Formerly a semi-presidential republic, it is now a parliamentary republic according to David Arter, First Chair of Politics at Aberdeen University. In his \"Scandinavian Politics Today\" (Manchester University Press, revised 2008 {{ISBN|9780719078538}}), he quotes {{Cite journal |last=Nousiainen |first=Jaakko |date=June 2001 |title=From semi-presidentialism to parliamentary government: political and constitutional developments in Finland |journal=[[Scandinavian Political Studies]] |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=95\u2013109 |doi=10.1111/1467-9477.00048 |ref=harv}} as follows: \"There are hardly any grounds for the epithet 'semi-presidential'.\" Arter's own conclusions are only slightly more nuanced: \"The adoption of a new constitution on 1 March 2000 meant that Finland was no longer a case of semi-presidential government other than in the minimalist sense of a situation where a popularly elected fixed-term president exists alongside a prime minister and cabinet who are responsible to parliament (Elgie 2004: 317)\". According to the Finnish Constitution, the president has no possibility to rule the government without the ministerial approval, and does not have the power to dissolve the parliament under his or her own desire. Finland is actually represented by its prime minister, and not by its president, in the Council of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union. The 2012 constitutional amendments reduced the powers of the president even further.</ref> The position still does entail some powers, including responsibility for [[Foreign relations of Finland|foreign policy]] (excluding affairs related to the [[European Union]]) in cooperation with the [[Finnish Government|cabinet]], being [[Commander-in-Chief|the head of the armed forces]], some decree and pardoning powers, and some appointive powers. Direct, one- or two-stage elections are used to elect the president for a term of six years and for a maximum of two consecutive terms. The current president is [[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]]; he took office on 1 March 2012. Former presidents were [[Kaarlo Juho St\u00e5hlberg|K. J. St\u00e5hlberg]] (1919\u20131925), [[Lauri Kristian Relander|L. K. Relander]] (1925\u20131931), [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud|P. E. Svinhufvud]] (1931\u20131937), [[Ky\u00f6sti Kallio]] (1937\u20131940), [[Risto Ryti]] (1940\u20131944), [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|C. G. E. Mannerheim]] (1944\u20131946), [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|J. K. Paasikivi]] (1946\u20131956), [[Urho Kekkonen]] (1956\u20131982), [[Mauno Koivisto]] (1982\u20131994), [[Martti Ahtisaari]] (1994\u20132000), and [[Tarja Halonen]] (2000\u20132012)<!-- don't add Sauli Niinist\u00f6 here, because he is not a former president -->.\n\nThe current president was elected from the ranks of the [[National Coalition Party]] for the first time since 1946. The presidency between 1946 and the present was instead held by a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] or the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]].\n\n=== Parliament ===\n{{Main|Parliament of Finland}}\n[[File:Eduskuntatalo Helsinki.jpg|thumb|The [[Parliament of Finland]]'s main building]]\n\nThe 200-member [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Parliament of Finland]] ({{Lang-fi|Eduskunta}}, {{Lang-sv|Riksdag}}) exercises supreme legislative authority in the country. It may alter the constitution and ordinary laws, dismiss the cabinet, and override presidential vetoes. Its acts are not subject to judicial review; the constitutionality of new laws is assessed by the parliament's [[Parliament of Finland#Committees|constitutional law committee]]. The parliament is elected for a term of four years using the proportional [[D'Hondt method]] within a number of multi-seat constituencies through the [[Open list#Most open|most open list]] multi-member districts. Various parliament committees listen to experts and prepare legislation. The [[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|speaker of the parliament]] is [[Paula Risikko]] ([[National Coalition]]).<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.eduskunta.fi/EN/tiedotteet/Pages/speaker-risikko-elected.aspx| title = Paula Risikko Elected as New Speaker of Parliament |publisher = [[Parliament of Finland|Eduskunta]]| author =| accessdate = 24 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince [[universal suffrage]] was introduced in 1906, the parliament has been dominated by the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] (former Agrarian Union), the [[National Coalition Party]], and the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]]. These parties have enjoyed approximately equal support, and their combined vote has totalled about 65\u201380% of all votes. Their lowest common total of MPs, 121, was reached in the 2011 elections. For a few decades after 1944, the [[Communist Party of Finland|Communists]] were a strong fourth party. Due to the electoral system of proportional representation, and the relative reluctance of voters to switch their support between parties, the relative strengths of the parties have commonly varied only slightly from one election to another. However, there have been some long-term trends, such as the rise and fall of the Communists during the Cold War; the steady decline into insignificance of the [[Liberals (Finland)|Liberals]] and its predecessors from 1906 to 1980; and the rise of the [[Green League]] since 1983. In the 2011 elections, the [[True Finns|Finns Party]] achieved exceptional success, increasing its representation from 5 to 39 seats, surpassing the Centre Party.<ref>The source for historical information on party support is [[:fi:Suomen eduskunta#Kansanedustajat puolueittain ja vaaleittain|the Finnish Wikipedia's article on the parliament]]</ref>\n\nThe autonomous province of \u00c5land, which forms a [[federacy]] with Finland, elects one member to the parliament, who traditionally joins the [[parliamentary group]] of the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]]. (The province also holds elections for its own permanent [[Parliament of \u00c5land|regional council]], and in the [[2011 \u00c5land legislative election|2011 elections]], [[\u00c5land Centre]] was the largest party.)\n\nThe Parliament can be dissolved by a recommendation of the Prime Minister, endorsed by the President. This procedure has never been used, although the parliament was dissolved eight times under the pre-2000 constitution, when this action was the sole prerogative of the president.\n\nAfter the [[2015 Finnish parliamentary election|parliamentary elections on 19 April 2015]], the seats were divided among eight parties as follows:<ref>{{cite web| url = http://vaalit.yle.fi/tulospalvelu/2015/eduskuntavaalit/?puolueet_##taulukko| title = Eduskuntavaalit 2015 \u2013 tulospalvelu \u2013 yle.fi| publisher = [[Yle]]| author =| accessdate = 5 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The cabinet can be dismissed by a parliamentary vote of no confidence, although this rarely happens (the last time in 1957), as the parties represented in the cabinet usually make up a majority in the parliament.<ref>[[:fi:Ep\u00e4luottamuslause|The Finnish Wikipedia's article on Motion of no confidence]]</ref>\n\nThe cabinet exercises most executive powers, and originates most of the bills that the parliament then debates and votes on. It is headed by the [[Prime Minister of Finland]], and consists of him or her, of other ministers, and of the [[Chancellor of Justice#Finland|Chancellor of Justice]]. The current prime minister is [[Sanna Marin]] (Social Democratic Party). Each minister heads his or her ministry, or, in some cases, has responsibility for a subset of a ministry's policy. After the prime minister, the most powerful minister is the [[Minister of Finance (Finland)|minister of finance]]. The incumbent Minister of Finance is [[Katri Kulmuni]].\n\nAs no one party ever dominates the parliament, Finnish cabinets are multi-party coalitions. As a rule, the post of prime minister goes to the leader of the biggest party and that of the minister of finance to the leader of the second biggest.\n\n=== Law ===\n{{Main|Law of Finland|Judicial system of Finland}}\n[[File:Supreme Court of Finland.jpg|thumb|right|The Court House of the [[Supreme Court of Finland|Supreme Court]]]]\nThe judicial system of Finland is a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system divided between [[court]]s with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and [[administrative court]]s with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Finnish law is codified and based on [[Judiciary of Sweden|Swedish law]] and in a wider sense, civil law or [[Roman law]]. The court system for civil and criminal jurisdiction consists of local courts (''k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus'', ''tingsr\u00e4tt''), regional appellate courts (''hovioikeus'', ''hovr\u00e4tt''), and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] (''korkein oikeus'', ''h\u00f6gsta domstolen''). The administrative branch of justice consists of administrative courts (''hallinto-oikeus'', ''f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstol'') and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Administrative Court|Supreme Administrative Court]] (''korkein hallinto-oikeus'', ''h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen''). In addition to the regular courts, there are a few special courts in certain branches of administration.

Since the 1980s the social security has been cut back, but still the system is one of the most comprehensive in the world. Created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II, the social security system was an outgrowth of the traditional Nordic belief that the state was not inherently hostile to the well-being of its citizens, but could intervene benevolently on their behalf. According to some social historians, the basis of this belief was a relatively benign history that had allowed the gradual emergence of a free and independent peasantry in the Nordic countries and had curtailed the dominance of the nobility and the subsequent formation of a powerful right wing. Finland's history has been harsher than the histories of the other Nordic countries, but not harsh enough to bar the country from following their path of social development.<ref name=\"LOC\">Text from PD source: US Library of Congress: ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/fitoc.html A Country Study: Finland]'', Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990.</ref>\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Finnish Defence Forces|Military history of Finland}}\n{{See also|List of wars involving Finland}}\n\nThe Finnish Defence Forces consist of a [[En cadre|cadre]] of professional soldiers (mainly officers and technical personnel), currently serving conscripts, and a large reserve. The standard readiness strength is 34,700 people in uniform, of which 25% are professional soldiers. A universal male [[conscription]] is in place, under which all male Finnish nationals above 18 years of age serve for 6 to 12 months of armed service or 12 months of civilian (non-armed) service.\nVoluntary post-conscription overseas peacekeeping service is popular, and troops serve around the world in UN, NATO, and EU missions. Approximately 500 women choose voluntary military service every year.<ref>[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naisten_vapaaehtoinen_asepalvelus.dsp Women's voluntary service] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409182820/http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naisten_vapaaehtoinen_asepalvelus.dsp |date=9 April 2008 }} (in Finnish)</ref> Women are allowed to serve in all combat arms including front-line infantry and special forces.\nThe army consists of a highly mobile field army backed up by local defence units.

The country lies between the latitudes 60\u00b0N and 70\u00b0N, and it has severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frost. However, because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current moderate the climate, Finland contains half of the world's arable land north of 60\u00b0 north latitude. Annual precipitation is usually sufficient, but it occurs almost exclusively during the winter months, making summer droughts a constant threat. In response to the climate, farmers have relied on quick-ripening and frost-resistant varieties of crops, and they have cultivated south-facing slopes as well as richer bottomlands to ensure production even in years with summer frosts. Most farmland was originally either forest or swamp, and the soil has usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralize excess acid and to improve fertility. Irrigation has generally not been necessary, but drainage systems are often needed to remove excess water. Finland's agriculture has been efficient and productive\u2014at least when compared with farming in other European countries.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nForests play a key role in the country's economy, making it one of the world's leading wood producers and providing raw materials at competitive prices for the crucial wood-processing industries. As in agriculture, the government has long played a leading role in forestry, regulating tree cutting, sponsoring technical improvements, and establishing long-term plans to ensure that the country's forests continue to supply the wood-processing industries. To maintain the country's comparative advantage in forest products, Finnish authorities moved to raise lumber output toward the country's ecological limits. In 1984, the government published the Forest 2000 plan, drawn up by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The plan aimed at increasing forest harvests by about 3% per year, while conserving forestland for recreation and other uses.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nPrivate sector employees amount to 1.8 million, out of which around a third with tertiary education.

In the [[pulp and paper industry]], many of the largest companies are based in Finland ([[Ahlstrom]], [[Mets\u00e4 Board]], and [[UPM (company)|UPM]]). However, the Finnish economy has diversified, with expansion into fields such as electronics (e.g. [[Nokia]]), metrology ([[Vaisala]]), transport fuels ([[Neste]]), chemicals ([[Kemira]]), engineering consulting ([[P\u00f6yry]]), and information technology (e.g. [[Rovio Entertainment]], known for [[Angry Birds]]), and is no longer dominated by the two sectors of metal and forest industry. Likewise, the structure has changed, with the service sector growing, with manufacturing reducing in importance; agriculture is only a minor part. Despite this, production for export is still more prominent than in Western Europe, thus making Finland more vulnerable to global economic trends.\n\nIn an [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] report released in September 2011, Finland clinched the second place after the United States on Benchmarking IT Industry Competitiveness 2011 which scored on 6 key indicators: overall business environment, technology infrastructure, human capital, legal framework, public support for industry development, and research and development landscape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/seasia/singapore-tops-it-competitiveness-in-asia-pacific-ranks-no-3-worldwide/468002 |title=Singapore Tops IT Competitiveness in Asia Pacific, Ranks No. 3 Worldwide |date=27 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220204542/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/seasia/singapore-tops-it-competitiveness-in-asia-pacific-ranks-no-3-worldwide/468002 |archivedate=20 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Public policy ===\n{{See also|Nordic model}}\n\nFinnish politicians have often emulated other Nordics and the Nordic model.<ref name=\"nordicmodel\">[http://www.etla.fi/files/1892_the_nordic_model_complete.pdf The Nordic Model] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905212132/http://www.etla.fi/files/1892_the_nordic_model_complete.pdf |date=5 September 2012 }} by Torben M.

The era saw a rise of poets and novelists who wrote in Finnish, notably [[Aleksis Kivi]], [[Eino Leino]] and [[Johannes Linnankoski]]. Many writers of the national awakening wrote in Swedish, such as the national poet [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]] and [[Zachris Topelius]].\n\nAfter Finland became independent, there was a rise of [[Modernist literature|modernist writers]], most famously the Finnish-speaking [[Mika Waltari]] and Swedish-speaking [[Edith S\u00f6dergran]]. [[Frans Eemil Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1939. World War II prompted a return to more national interests in comparison to a more international line of thought, characterized by [[V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linna]]. Besides Kalevala and Waltari, the Swedish-speaking [[Tove Jansson]] is the most translated Finnish writer. <!--Pure opinion?: Literature in modern Finland is in a healthy state.--> Popular modern writers include [[Arto Paasilinna]], [[Ilkka Remes]], [[Kari Hotakainen]], [[Sofi Oksanen]], and [[Jari Tervo]], while the best novel is annually awarded the prestigious [[Finlandia Prize]].\n[[File:Sammon puolustus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]], ''[[The Defense of the Sampo]]'', 1896, [[Turku Art Museum]]]]\n\n=== Visual arts, design, and architecture ===\n{{See also|Architecture of Finland|Art in Finland}}\nThe visual arts in Finland started to form their individual characteristics in the 19th century, when Romantic nationalism was rising in autonomic Finland. The best known of Finnish painters, [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]], started painting in a naturalist style, but moved to national romanticism. Finland's best-known sculptor of the 20th century was [[W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen]], remembered for his monumental [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] and sculptures. Finns have made major contributions to [[handicraft]]s and [[industrial design]]: among the internationally renowned figures are [[Timo Sarpaneva]], [[Tapio Wirkkala]] and [[Ilmari Tapiovaara]]. Finnish architecture is famous around the world, and has contributed significantly to several styles internationally, such as [[Jugendstil]] (or [[Art Nouveau]]), [[Nordic Classicism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]]. Among the top 20th-century Finnish architects to gain international recognition are [[Eliel Saarinen]] and his son [[Eero Saarinen]]. Architect [[Alvar Aalto]] is regarded as among the most important 20th-century designers in the world;<ref>James Stevens Curl, ''Dictionary of Architecture'', Grange Books, Rochester, 2005, p. 1.</ref> he helped bring [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist architecture]] to Finland, but soon was a pioneer in its development towards an organic style.<ref>Sigfried Giedion, ''Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2nd edition, 1949.</ref> Aalto is also famous for his work in furniture, lamps, textiles and [[glassware]], which were usually incorporated into his buildings.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Finland|Rock music in Finland|Sami music}}\n[[File:Jean Sibelius, 1913.jpg|thumb|upright|The Finnish composer [[Jean Sibelius]] (1865\u20131957), a significant figure in the history of [[European classical music|classical music]]]]\n;Classical\nMuch of Finland's classical music is influenced by traditional Karelian melodies and lyrics, as comprised in the ''[[Kalevala]]''. Karelian culture is perceived as the purest expression of the [[Baltic Finns|Finnic]] myths and beliefs, less influenced by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] influence than the [[Nordic folk dance music]] that largely replaced the kalevaic tradition. Finnish [[folk music]] has undergone a [[roots revival]] in recent decades, and has become a part of [[popular music]].\n\nThe people of northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway, the [[Sami people|Sami]], are known primarily for highly spiritual songs called [[joik]]. The same word sometimes refers to [[lavlu]] or vuelie songs, though this is technically incorrect.\n\nThe first Finnish opera was written by the German-born composer [[Fredrik Pacius]] in 1852. Pacius also wrote the music to the poem [[Maamme|''Maamme/V\u00e5rt land'' (Our Country)]], Finland's [[national anthem]]. In the 1890s Finnish nationalism based on the ''Kalevala'' spread, and [[Jean Sibelius]] became famous for his vocal symphony ''[[Kullervo (Sibelius)|Kullervo]]''. He soon received a grant to study ''runo singers'' in Karelia and continued his rise as the first prominent Finnish musician. In 1899 he composed ''[[Finlandia]]'', which played its important role in Finland gaining independence. He remains one of Finland's most popular national figures and is a symbol of the nation.\n\nToday, Finland has a very lively classical music scene and many of Finland's important [[List of Finnish composers|composers]] are still alive, such as [[Magnus Lindberg (Finnish composer)|Magnus Lindberg]], [[Kaija Saariaho]], [[Kalevi Aho]], and [[Aulis Sallinen]]. The composers are accompanied by a large number of great conductors such as [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]], [[Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4]], [[Jukka-Pekka Saraste]], and [[Leif Segerstam]]. Some of the internationally acclaimed Finnish classical musicians are [[Karita Mattila]], [[Soile Isokoski]], [[Pekka Kuusisto]], [[Olli Mustonen]], and [[Linda Brava|Linda Lampenius]].\n\n;Modern\n[[File:Apocalyptica1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Perttu Kivilaakso]] of [[Apocalyptica]]]]\n''Iskelm\u00e4'' (coined directly from the German word ''[[Schlager]]'', meaning \"hit\") is a traditional Finnish word for a light popular song. Finnish popular music also includes various kinds of [[dance music]]; [[Tango music|tango]], a style of [[Music of Argentina|Argentine music]], is also popular. The light music in Swedish-speaking areas has more influences from Sweden. Modern Finnish popular music includes a number of prominent rock bands, [[jazz]] musicians, [[hip hop]] performers, dance music acts, etc.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nDuring the early 1960s, the first significant wave of Finnish rock groups emerged, playing [[instrumental rock]] inspired by groups such as [[The Shadows]]. Around 1964, [[Beatlemania]] arrived in Finland, resulting in further development of the local rock scene. During the late 1960s and '70s, Finnish rock musicians increasingly wrote their own music instead of translating international hits into Finnish. During the decade, some [[progressive rock]] groups such as [[Tasavallan Presidentti]] and [[Wigwam (Finnish band)|Wigwam]] gained respect abroad but failed to make a commercial breakthrough outside Finland. This was also the fate of the [[rock and roll]] group [[Hurriganes]]. The Finnish punk scene produced some internationally acknowledged names including [[Terveet K\u00e4det]] in the 1980s.

The word ''[http://www.binyanolam.net yeshiva]'' is applied to the activity of learning in class, and hence to a learning \"session.\"<ref>\"Session\", in fact, similarly derives from the Latin ''sedere'', \"to sit.\"</ref>\n\nThe transference in meaning of the term from the learning session to the institution itself appears to have occurred by the time of the great [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]], which were known as ''shte ha-yeshivot'' (the two colleges).\n\n==History==\n:''See [[Jewish education #The yeshiva]]''\n===Origins===\nThe [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal prayers. Likewise, every [[beth din]] (\"house of judgement\") was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court ([[Mishnah]], tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]). These might be indications of the historicity of the classical yeshiva. As indicated by the [[Talmud]],<ref>(Where in the Talmud, and in which Talmud (Bavli or Yerushalmi?)</ref> adults generally took off two months a year, [[Elul]] and [[Adar]], the months preceding the [[pilgrimage festivals]] of [[Sukkot]] and [[Pesach]], called ''Yar\u1e25ei Kalla'' ([[Aramaic]] for \"Months of Kallah\") to study. The rest of the year, they worked.\n\n===Geonic Period===\n[[File:Rabbi Ashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A depiction of [[Sura Academy|Sura]] (from [[Beit Hatefutsot]])]]\nThe Geonic period takes its name from [[Gaon (Hebrew)|''Gaon'']], the title bestowed on the heads of the three yeshivas in existence from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.\n\nThroughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot. These were named for the cities in which they were located: [[Jerusalem]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and [[Pumbedita]]; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to [[Cairo]], and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to [[Baghdad]], but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was however, no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded immense power as the principal body for interpreting [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. In this regard, the community saw the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. Those appointed as the head of a congregation would serve as a go-between for the local congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These local leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshivot were financially supported through a number of means. There were fixed, but voluntary, yearly contributions made to the yeshivas; these annual contributions were collected and handled by the local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, and could consist of money or goods.\n\nThe yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century. After the scattering of the yeshiva, education in Jewish religious studies became the responsibility of individual [[synagogues]]. No organization ever came to replace the three great yeshivot of Jerusalem, Sura and Pumbedita.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgement in One Volume |last=Goitein |first=S.D. |editor-last=Lassner |editor-first=Jacob |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520240599 |url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520240599/a-mediterranean-society |accessdate=2018-10-06}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Geonic Period to the 19th century===\nAfter the Geonic Period Jews went on to establishing more Yeshiva academies in Europe and in Northern Africa.

Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, the students who received ''[[semikhah]]'' (rabbinical ordination) would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere or join the workforce.\n\n====Lithuanian yeshivas====\n[[Image:Volozhin yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old photo of the Volozhin yeshiva]]\n[[File:Ponivez1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]]]] \nOrganised [[Torah study]] was revolutionised by [[Chaim Volozhin]], an influential 18th-century Lithuanian leader of Judaism and disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]]. In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater to those who were looking for more intensive study.\n\nWith the support of his teacher, Volozhin gathered a large number of interested students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Valozhyn]], located in modern-day [[Belarus]]. The [[Volozhin yeshiva]] was closed some 60 years later in 1892 due to the Russian government's demands for the introduction of certain secular studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schacter|first1=Jacob J. |title=Haskalah, Secular Studies and the Close of the Yeshiva in Volozhin in 1892 |jstor=40914771 |journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal |volume=2 |pages=76\u2013133 |date=1990}}</ref> Thereafter, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Slabodka]], [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisk]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. Many prominent contemporary ''yeshivot'' in the United States and [[Israel]] are continuations of these institutions, and often bear the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Israel Salanter]] initiated the [[Mussar movement]] in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and other emerging political ideologies (such as [[Zionism]]) that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment [[Talmudic]] study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts ([[mussar literature]]), as well as a new literature for the movement. By focusing the student on self-understanding and introspection, often with profound psychological insight, the spiritual aims of Judaism could be internalized.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshiva world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks (\"mussar shmues\"). A ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' (spiritual mentor) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the [[Hasidic Judaism]] world. Hasidism began in the previous century within traditional Jewish life in Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th Century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.\n\nSome variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and ''mussar'', for example whether the emphasis would be placed on ''beki'ut'' (breadth) or ''iyyun'' (depth). ''[[Pilpul]]'', a type of in-depth analytical and casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries that was traditionally reserved for the profound nuances of investigative Talmudic study, was not always given a place. The new analytical approach of the [[Brisker method]], developed by [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], has become widely popular; however, there are other approaches such as those of [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Chofetz Chaim]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In ''mussar'', different schools developed, such as Slabodka and [[Novardok Yeshiva|Novhardok]], though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.\n\n====Hasidic yeshivas====\n[[File:Breslov Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Breslov (Hasidic group) |Breslov]] Yeshiva in [[Mea Shearim]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\n[[Image:Satmer Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].]]\nWith the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on Talmudic literature that is central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], augmented by study of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] yeshiva system of [[Tomchei Temimim]], founded by [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]] in Russia in 1897, and the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] established in Poland in 1930 by [[Meir Shapiro]], who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the [[Daf Yomi]] daily cycle of Talmud study.\n\nIn many Hasidic yeshivas, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional ''[[devekut]]'' (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his [[Rebbe]] is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the [[Shabbat]] in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism. \n\nIn contrast, Chabad and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties' Hasidic texts in central focus; see [[#Ethics, mysticism and philosophy|below]]. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn's wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts \"with ''pilpul''\". The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], to systematically investigate and articulate the \"Torah of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]\" in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the \"Tract on Ecstasy\" by [[Dovber Schneuri]]) between general Hasidism's emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of [[Nachman of Breslov]] awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.\n\n====Sephardi yeshivas====\n:''See: [[:Category:Sephardic yeshivas]], as well the more complete, [[:he:\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea|\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea]]''\n[[File:Porat Yosef Yeshiva, Geula branch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Geula]] branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva.]]\nAlthough the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern [[Sephardi]] Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic [[madrasa]]s. In 19th-century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed? |accessdate=2018-10-06 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}</ref> Early educational institutions on the European model were [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]] founded in 1870s Iraq and [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.\n\nThe Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) in a more mainstream position than in the European [[Ashkenazi]] world. This difference of emphasis arose in reaction to the historical events of the [[Sabbatean]] heresy in the 17th Century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of the strength of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel after the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there]], some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. Nonetheless, the European prescriptions to reserve advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.\n\n===19th century to present===\n====Conservative movement yeshivas====\n[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|250px|thumb|JTS building in [[Manhattan]]]]\nIn 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] was founded. It was headed by [[Zecharias Frankel]], and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with \"positive-historical Judaism\", the predecessor of [[Conservative Judaism]]. In subsequent years, Conservative Judaism established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. However, many do not officially refer to themselves as \"yeshivas\" (one exception is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study ''lishmah'' (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.\n\n====Nondenominational or mixed yeshivas====\nNon-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to Conservative Judaism include [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in New York, the leaders of whom include [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members [[Elie Kaunfer]] and [[Shai Held]]. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] (AJR-CA) is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis.\nSee also [[Institute of Traditional Judaism]].\n\nAdditionally, Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary, developed and led by Conservative and Reform rabbis, offers a two-year online rabbinical ordination program with a \"post-denominational\" rabbinical ordination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishpluralism.org/ |title=Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary |publisher=PRS |date= January 23, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries====\n[[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), affiliated with [[Reform Judaism]], was founded in 1875 under the leadership of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], founded in Pennsylvania in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at non-denominational seminaries like the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, and the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College. In Europe, Reform Judaism trains rabbis at Leo Baeck College in London, UK and Abraham Geiger Kolleg in Potsdam, Germany.

After (and during) the war, numerous other Haredi and Hasidic Yeshivot were re-established there by survivors.\nThe Mir in Jerusalem - today the largest Yeshiva in the world - was established in 1944, by Rabbi [[Eliezer Yehuda Finkel]] who had traveled to Palestine to obtain visas for his students.\nPorat Yosef, the leading Sephardi Yeshiva, was founded in 1914; its  predecessor, Yeshivat Ohel Moed was founded in 1904.\nFrom the 1940s and onward, especially following  immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities,  Sephardi leaders, such as [[Ovadia Yosef]] and [[Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel]], established various yeshivot to facilitate Torah education for Sephardi and [[Mizrahi Jews]] (and alternative to Lithuanian yeshivot).\n\nThe Haredi community has grown with time - In 2016, 9% of Israel's population was Haredi, including [[Sephardic Haredim]] -  supporting a large number of yeshivot correspondingly (see [[Israel #Religion]]). \nBoys and girls here attend separate schools, and proceed to higher Torah study, in a yeshiva or seminary, respectively, starting anywhere between the ages of 13 and 18; see ''[[Chinuch Atzmai]]'' and ''[[Bais Yaakov]]''.\nA significant proportion of young men then remain in yeshiva until their marriage; after marriage, many continue their Torah studies in a kollel. (In 2006, there were 80,000 in full-time learning .<ref name =\"JVL\"/>)\nKollel studies usually focus on deep analysis of Talmud, and those Tractates not usually covered in the standard \"undergraduate\" program ; see [[#Talmud study]] below.\nSome Kollels similarly focus on Halacha in total, others specifically on those topics required for ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) or  [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|''Dayanut'']] (qualification as a Rabbinic Judge). The certification in question is often conferred by the Rosh Yeshiva.\n\n[[Mercaz Harav]], the foundational and leading [[Religious Zionism|Religious-Zionist]] yeshiva was established in 1924 by Ashkenazi [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi]] [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]. Many in the Religious Zionist community today attend a [[Hesder]] yeshiva (discussed [[#Types of yeshivot|below]]) during [[Religious_Zionism#Military_service|their national service]]; these offer a kollel for Rabbinical students. (Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R.

On Thursday nights, there may be an extra long night seder, known as ''mishmar'' sometimes lasting beyond 1:00 am, and in some yeshivot even until the following sunrise. On Fridays, there is usually at least one ''seder'' in the morning, with unstructured learning schedules for the afternoon. Saturdays have a special [[Shabbat]] schedule which includes some ''sedarim'' but usually no shiur.\n|}\n[[File:Yeshiva lunchroom.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Mincha]]'',  [[Yeshiva Centre, Melbourne]] ]]\nYeshiva study is differentiated from, for example university study, as regards several structural features - curriculum aside.\nThe year is structured into \"''zmanim''\"; the day is structured into \"''seders''\".\nThe learning itself is delivered through a \"''shiur''\", a lecture with pre-specified sources; \nstudy in general, and particularly the preparation for ''shiur'', takes place in \"''chavruta''\" or paired-study.\nThis study is in a common venue called the ''[[beth midrash|bet midrash]]''.\n\nThe institution is headed by its ''[[Rosh Yeshiva]]'', while other senior Rabbis are referred to as \"Ram\" (''[[Rosh mesivta|Rosh Mesivta]], Reish Metivta''); \nthe [[Mashgiach ruchani|''Mashgiach'']] assumes responsibility for students' spiritual development (''[[Mashpia]]'', in Hasidic Yeshivot).\nA Kollel is headed by its ''[[Rosh Kollel]]'', even when it is part of a Yeshiva.\nA ''sho'el umeishiv'' (lit. \"ask and he answers\") is usually available to consult to students on difficult points in their day's Talmudic studies.\nThe Rabbi responsible for the (Talmud) ''shiur'' is known as a ''[[Maggid Shiur]]''. Students are known as ''talmidim''.\n\n===Academic year===\n{{see also|Bein Hazmanim}}\nIn most yeshivot, the year is divided into three periods (terms) called ''zmanim'' (lit. times; sing. ''zman''). ''Elul zman'' starts from the beginning of the Hebrew month of [[Elul]] and extends until the end of [[Yom Kippur]]. The six-weeks-long semester is the shortest yet most intense session, as it comes before the High Holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and Yom Kippur. Winter ''zman'' starts after [[Sukkot]] and lasts until about two weeks before [[Passover]], a duration of five months (six in a [[Jewish calendar|Jewish leap year]]). Summer ''zman'' starts after Passover and lasts until [[Rosh Chodesh]] Av or [[Tisha B'Av]], a duration of about three months.\n\n===Chavruta-style learning===\n{{main|Chavruta}}\nYeshiva students prepare for and review the [[Shiur (Torah)|''shiur'']] (lecture) with their ''chavruta'' during a study session known as a ''seder''.<ref name=\"Forta\"/> In contrast to conventional classroom learning, in which a teacher lectures to the student and the student repeats the information back in tests, ''chavruta''-style learning challenges the student to analyze and explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights of the meaning of the text.<ref name=\"agora\"/><ref name=\"jeff\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rebjeff.com/1/category/singing/1.html |title=Bringing the People Together |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=23 June 2011 |publisher=Reb Jeff}}</ref> A ''chavruta'' helps a student keep his mind focused on the learning, sharpen his reasoning powers, develop his thoughts into words, organize his thoughts into logical arguments, and understand another person's viewpoint.<ref name=\"zobin\">{{cite book |pages=104&ndash;106 |title=Breakthrough to Learning Gemora: A Concise, Analytical Guide |last=Zobin |first=Zvi |year=1996 |publisher=Kest-Lebovits}}</ref>\n\nChavruta-style learning tends to be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud to each other, and then analyze, question, debate, and even argue their points of view to arrive at an understanding of the text.

The dual curriculum was pioneered by the Manhattan Talmudical Academy of [[Yeshiva University]] (now known as [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy]]) in 1916.\n#[[Mechina]] - For Israeli high-school graduates who wish to study for one year before entering the army. In [[Telshe yeshiva|Telshe]] yeshivas and in [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel|Ner Yisroel of Baltimore]], the Mesivtas/Yeshiva ketanas are known as Mechinas.\n#[[Beth Midrash]] - For high school graduates, and is attended from one year to many years, dependent on the career plans and affiliation of the student.\n#Yeshivat [[Hesder]] - Yeshiva that has an arrangement with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] by which the students enlist together in the same unit and, as much as is possible serve in the same unit in the army. Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva. The first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\n#[[Kollel]] - Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea has its intellectual roots in the Torah;  [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal learning. However, it is mostly a modern innovation of 19th-century Europe. A kollel will often be in the same location as the yeshiva.\n#[[Baal Teshuva]] yeshivot catering to the needs of the newly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].\nTraditionally, religious girls' schools are not called \"yeshiva.\" The [[Bais Yaakov]] system was started in 1918 under the guidance of [[Sarah Schenirer]]. This system provided girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skewed more toward practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) and the study of [[Tanakh]], rather than [[Talmud]]. Bais Yaakovs are strictly [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] schools. Non-Haredi girls' schools' curricula often includes the study of Mishnah and sometimes Talmud. They are also sometimes called \"yeshiva\" (e.g., Prospect Park Yeshiva). Post-high schools for women are generally called \"seminary\" or ''\"[[midrasha]]\"''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Languages===\n''Classes'' in most Lithuanian and Hasidic yeshivot (throughout the world) are taught in [[Yiddish]]; \n[[Kol Torah]], est 1939 in Jerusalem and headed by [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]] for over 40 years, was the first mainstream Haredi yeshiva to teach in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish.\nSephardi, Modern Orthodox, Zionist, and ''baal teshuvah'' yeshivot use [[Modern Hebrew]] or the local language. \n\nStudents learn with each other in whatever language they are most proficient, with Hasidic students usually learning in Yiddish, Israeli Lithuanian students in Hebrew, and American Lithuanian students in English.\n\n=== College credit ===\nAlthough often not encouraged, some yeshivas permit students to attend college on a limited basis. This concession is facilitated by arrangements for the student to receive credit towards a college degree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.YeshivaDegree.com |title=Guide To Degree Completion Programs for Yeshiva Students |year=2011 |publisher=YeshivaDegree.com |accessdate=2018-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402100219/http://www.yeshivadegree.com/ |archive-date=2012-04-02 |url-status=dead}}</ref> \n[[Yeshiva University]] in New York provides a year's worth of credit for yeshiva studies.\n\nHaredi institutions with similar arrangements in place include [[Lander College for Men]], [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]] and [[Hebrew Theological College]].\nFor historical context see: [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary]], [[Volozhin yeshiva #History]], [[Yitzchok Hutner #Rabbinic and teaching career]] and [[Mesivta #Modern-day concept]].\n\n==Curriculum==\n[[Torah study]] at an Orthodox yeshiva comprises the study of [[rabbinic literature]], principally the Talmud, along with the study of ''[[Halacha]]'' (Jewish law); \n[[Musar literature|Musar]] and [[Hasidic philosophy]] are often studied also.\n<ref name=\"Actually\">{{cite news |last=Krakowski|first=Moshe |date=26 December 2018 |title=What Yeshiva Kids Are Actually Studying All Day |url=https://forward.com/life/faith/416616/what-yeshiva-kids-are-actually-studying-all-day/ |work=Forward |location= |access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref> \nIn some institutions, classical [[Jewish philosophy]] or Kabbalah are formally studied, or the works of individual thinkers (such as [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]). \n\n[[Rabbi#Non-Orthodox_Judaism|Non-Orthodox institutions]] offer a synthesis of traditional and critical methods, allowing Jewish texts and tradition to encounter social change and modern scholarship. The curriculum focuses on classical Jewish subjects, including Talmud, Tanakh, Midrash, ''halacha'', and Philosophy, with an [[Biblical_criticism#Contemporary_methods|openness to modern scholarship]]. \nNote that, often, in these institutions less emphasis is placed on Talmud and Jewish law, \"but rather on sociology, cultural studies, and modern Jewish philosophy\".<ref name=\"Blane\">Rabbi [[Steven Blane]] (N.D.).

Generally, two parallel Talmud streams are covered during a ''zman'' (trimester). The first is ''iyyun'' (in-depth study), often confined to selected legally focused tractates with an emphasis on analytical skills and close reference to the classical commentators; the second, ''beki'ut'', seeks to cover ground more speedily in order to build general knowledge of the Talmud.\n\nIn the yeshiva system of Talmudic study, the undergraduate yeshivot focus on eight ''[[Masekhet|mesechtohs]]'' ([[tractate]]s) that deal with civil jurisprudence (''[[Nezikin]]''); through them, the student can best master the [[Gemara #Argumentation and debate|proper technique of Talmudic analysis]]. After this technique is mastered, the student is ready to go on to other areas of the Talmud<ref name=\"Actually\"/> (see, for example, [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel #Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)]]). Tractates [[Berakhot (tractate)|''Berachot'']], [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Sukkah'']] and [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Pesachim'']] are often included.\n\nWorks initially studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by [[Rashi]], and  ''[[Tosafot]]'', a parallel analysis and critique.\nThe integration of Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot, is considered as foundational - and prerequisite - to further analysis (in fact, this combination is sometimes referred to by its own acronym, ''\"gefet\"''  \u05d2\u05e4\u05f4\u05ea - ''[[Gemara]]'',  ''perush Rashi'',  ''Tosafot''). The [[Super-commentary|super-commentaries]] by  [[Solomon Luria|\"Maharshal\"]], [[Meir Lublin|\"Maharam\"]] and [[Samuel Edels|\"Maharsha\"]] address the three together.\n\nAt more advanced levels, additional ''[[Talmud#Commentaries|mefarshim]]'' (commentators) are studied: other ''[[rishonim]]'', from the 11th to 14th centuries, as well as ''[[acharonim]]'', from later generations. (There are two main schools of ''rishonim'', from France and from Spain, who will hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud.) \nAt these levels, students link the Talmudic discussion to [[Halakha #Codes of Jewish law|codified law]] - particularly ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (i.e. [[Rambam]]), ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' - by studying, also, the halakha-focused commentaries of [[Asher_ben_Jehiel#Works|\"Rosh\"]], [[Isaac_Alfasi#Sefer_haHalachot|\"Rif\"]] and [[Mordechai_ben_Hillel#Magnum_opus|\"Mordechai\"]].\n\nIn general, as the [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|level of the ''shiur'']] progresses, so the student must integrate more of these commentaries into their analysis of the ''[[sugya]]'' (loosely, Talmudic  \"unit of analysis\");\nand understand their various implications re practical-halakha.\nAt the higher levels - in Lithuanian influenced Yeshivot - the \"[[Brisker method]]\" of analysis is employed, [[#Lithuanian yeshivas|as mentioned]].\nSome yeshivot - such as [[Yeshivat_Birkat_Moshe|Birkat Moshe]] - particularly emphasize the Rambam.\nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' delivers a weekly ''shiur klali'' (comprehensive lecture), which sums up the week's learning; this is attended by all levels.\n\nTypically, boys begin their study of Talmud in middle school, initially studying [[Mishnah]], the component of Talmud where the underlying \"cases\" are presented. (At this stage, they have completed their survey of ''Chumash''; see [[#Torah_and_Bible_study|below]].)\nIn early high school, ''[[gemara]]'', the analytic component, is introduced; by late high school some are able to work with ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Jewish law===\nGenerally, a period is devoted to the study of practical ''halakha''. The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazi yeshivot is the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', a compilation of ''halakhic'' opinions rendered after the time of the writing of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. \nIn Sephardic yeshivot, the ''Shulchan Aruch'' itself is more commonly studied, along with the [[Beit Yosef (book)|''Bet Yosef'']] commentary; the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' and [[Yaakov_Chaim_Sofer#Works|''Kaf Hachaim'']] are also often studied;  [[Yosef_Hayyim#Works|''Ben Ish Hai'']] is a standard reference.\nIn [[Chabad]] yeshivot,<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\"/> emphasis is placed upon study of ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''. Beginning students are encouraged to also work through the [[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch'']], so as to survey all areas of applicable Halacha.  Other students, similarly,  additionally review the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' through [[Daily Rambam Study|its daily study cycle]] (this is often outside of any ''seder''), here including  halachot relating to, for example, the Temple.\n\nStudents in ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) programs, and often those in [[kollel]], devote the largest portion of their schedule to ''halakha''.\nThe focus is in-depth study of those areas where (community) Rabbis will typically be asked ''\"shaylas\"'', or Halachik questions - [[Shabbat]], [[Kashrut]] (referred to as ''\"Issur v'Heter\"''), often [[Niddah]], sometimes  [[Bereavement in Judaism |Avelut]] - and their sources.\n<ref name=\"RCA\"/> \n<ref>[http://www.smicha.co.il/ smicha.co.il] - resource for the [[Chief_Rabbinate_of_Israel#Semikhah|Semikha of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], maintained by Rabbi [https://www.srugim.co.il/tag/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90 Harel Shapira]</ref> \n<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\">[http://rca.edu/media/pdf/1120/NbJg11207139.pdf ''CATALOG''], [[Rabbinical College of America]]</ref> \nThis entails the discussion of the ''halakha'' in the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''Bet Yosef'', through its final presentation in the ''Shulchan Aruch''; complemented by a study of key [[History of responsa in Judaism|''She'elot u-Teshuvot'']] ([[responsa]]), recent and historical.  \nThe underpin for this analysis is a deep knowledge of all relevant ''sugyas'', which are prepared accordingly within the schedule.\nStudents in a (Orthodox) Semikha program will thus have a strong background in Talmud, typically having spent at least four preceding years in Yeshiva;<ref name=\"RCA\">[http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/SemichaGuidelines22Dec2015.pdf ''Semicha Standards''], RCA Executive Committee, 2015.</ref> Kollel students likewise.\n(See [[Rabbi #Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism]],\n[[Posek #Formulating a ruling (psak din)]].)\nDuring the morning ''seder'', Semikha students continue their Talmud studies, learning the same ''masechet'' as the rest of the Yeshiva.\n\n===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===\nHaredi ''Yeshivot'' typically devote a ''seder'' to [[musar literature|''mussar'']] (ethics and character development). \nThe preeminent text studied is the ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'' (\"Path [of the] Just\") of [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. Other works of mussar literature studied include:\n*''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' (\"Paths [of the] Righteous\"); its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes [[Maimonides]], it was written some time after his works were disseminated.\n*''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (\"Duties of the Hearts\") by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].\n*''[[Ma'alot ha-Middot]]'' (\"Benefit [of good character] traits\") by [[Jehiel_ben_Jekuthiel_Anav|Jehiel Anav]]\n*''Mishnat R' Aharon'', Mussar Lectures on many topics by [[Aharon Kotler]].\n*''[[Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu|Mikhtav me-Eliyahu]]'', the works of [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]].\n\nHasidic yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of Hasidic philosophy (''Chassidus''). This draws on the earlier esoteric theology of ''[[Kabbalah]]'', but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional ''[[dveikus]]'' (cleaving to God) and spiritual contribution to daily Jewish life. This serves some similar purposes to ''mussar'', but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. Chabad yeshivot, for example, study the [[Tanya]], the [[Likutei Torah]], and the voluminous works of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch#The leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch|Rebbes of Chabad]] for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening. \nSee [[#Hasidic yeshivas|above]].\n\n[[#Sephardi yeshivas|As mentioned]], Sephardi ''yeshivot'' often incorporate study of selected Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum - [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|standard texts]], as well as works by [[Yosef Hayyim]], [[Yehuda Fatiyah]] and [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]]. Kabbalistic sources are brought in ''Halachik'' works such as ''Kaf Hachaim'' and ''Ben Ish Hai'' - see [[Sephardic law and customs #Lurianic Kabbalah]] - and are then studied indirectly also.\n\nIn Hesder, [[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot, ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish philosophy]] generalized / applied as \"[[Jewish thought]]\"; also ''[[Hashkafa]]'', \"worldview\") is taught formally, with classes systematically covering the [[Jewish_principles_of_faith|major topics]] and works (''[[Kuzari]], [[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nevukhim]], [[Sefer ha-Ikkarim]] , [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]], [[Derech Hashem]]'' and others). Hesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], \"Rav Kook\", who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy. The Modern Orthodox, similarly, study the works of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], \"Rav Soloveitchik\".\nHasidic philosophy and Mussar are also often taught; ''[[Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel#Jewish_philosophy|Maharal]]'' may have a dedicated ''shiur''. Machshava is also a focus-area of many ''Midrashot''.\n\nSome Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas also include formal study of ''Hashkafa'', especially at ''[[ba'al teshuva]]'' focused yeshivas; many ''Semikha'' programs likewise, particularly those with an outreach, or \"''[[kiruv]]''\", component. Regardless, students here typically study the major works independent of a ''shiur''.\n\n===Torah and Bible study===\nIntensive study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Torah) with the commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi 1040 - 1105) is stressed and taught in all elementary grades.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> In Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, this is often done with Yiddish translations. The rest of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible, comprising ''[[Nevi'im]]'' and ''[[Ketuvim]]'') is usually taught through high school, although less intensively. \n\nIn Yeshivot, thereafter,  Chumash and Tanakh are studied less directly. Yeshiva students typically follow the practice of ''[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]'', independently studying the upcoming ''[[parashah]]'' ([[weekly Torah portion]]) twice in the original Hebrew and once in [[Targum Onkelos]] (an [[Aramaic]] translation), with Rashi's commentary. Students often also study [[Nachmanides#Commentary_on_the_Torah|Ramban's commentary]], and, less often, other commentaries from the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' edition are reviewed. \nStudents may similarly study the Tanakh independently, but it is not taught ''per se''; exceptions are the five [[Megilloth]] and [[Psalms|Tehillim]]. \nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' usually delivers a weekly ''shiur'' on the ''parashah'', which is often [[Shiur (Torah)#Public study sessions|open to the public]]. \n\nBy contrast, in Hesder and Modern Orthodox yeshivot, the study of Chumash and Tanakh continues in parallel with Talmud study. These institutions offer formal ''shiurim'' in many, if not all, of the books of Nevi'im  and Ketuvim. These are often structured [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|by level]], similar to Talmud study, where the text is then analyzed in light of the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|various commentaries]] and [[Midrash#Classical_compilations|''Midrashim'']], typically complementing the ''Machshavah'' ''shiurim''. \n[[Oral_Torah#In_rabbinic_literature_and_commentary|More recent commentaries]] especially studied are ''[[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin#Bibliography|\"Netziv\"]]'' and  ''[[Malbim#Methodology and style|\"Malbim\"]]''; as well as reference works such as ''[[Da'at Miqra]]'' by [[Mordechai Breuer]] and others.\nThe commentaries by Ramban and [[Samson_Raphael_Hirsch#Commentary_on_the_Torah|\"Rav Hirsch\"]] provide much philosophical content.\nIntensive study of Tanakh, as for Machshava, is similarly a feature of many ''Midrashot''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bais Yaakov]]\n* [[Jewish day school]]\n* [[Mesivta]]\n* [[Religious school]]\n* [[Yeshivish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States |Religious education}}\n\n[[Category:Yeshivas| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish education]]\n[[Category:Jewish religious occupations]]\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Single-gender schools]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Jewish educational institution for Torah study}}\n{{About| the Jewish educational system|the private university|Yeshiva University| the website|Yeshiva.co}}\n{{original research|date=April 2019}}\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|religion}} \n[[File:Mirs 14.JPG|250px|thumb|right|[[Mir Yeshiva (Jerusalem)]] - largest yeshiva in the world]]\n[[File:BaisMedrashInterior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A typical [[beth midrash|''bet midrash'']] - [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]], [[Baltimore]]]]\n[[File:Carteret beis medrash.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Chavrusas in study - [[Yeshiva Gedola of Carteret]]]]\n[[File:OrYisrael8885.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Morning ''seder'', [[Petah_Tikva#Schools_and_religious_institutions|Or-Yisrael]] (a yeshiva founded by the [[Chazon Ish]])]]\n[[File:RoyLindmanRabbinicalSchoolJerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Students in ''[[Shiur (Torah)|shiur]]'', [[Jerusalem]]]]\n[[File:Rav_Kav_giving_Shiur_Klali_in_Yeshivas_Kerem_B'Yavne.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Shiur klali'', [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]]]]\nA '''yeshiva''' ({{IPAc-en|j|\u0259|\u02c8|\u0283|i\u02d0|v|\u0259}}; {{lang-he|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4||sitting}}; pl. {{rtl-lang|he|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea}}, {{transl|he|yeshivot}} or {{transl|he|yeshivos}}) is a [[Jewish education|Jewish]] [[educational institution]] that focuses on the study of traditional religious texts, primarily the [[Talmud]] and the [[Torah]], and [[Halacha]] (Jewish law).

Today, all non-Orthodox and a few [[Modern Orthodox]] yeshivas are open to females.

The word ''[http://www.binyanolam.net yeshiva]'' is applied to the activity of learning in class, and hence to a learning \"session.\"<ref>\"Session\", in fact, similarly derives from the Latin ''sedere'', \"to sit.\"</ref>\n\nThe transference in meaning of the term from the learning session to the institution itself appears to have occurred by the time of the great [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]], which were known as ''shte ha-yeshivot'' (the two colleges).\n\n==History==\n:''See [[Jewish education #The yeshiva]]''\n===Origins===\nThe [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal prayers. Likewise, every [[beth din]] (\"house of judgement\") was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court ([[Mishnah]], tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]). These might be indications of the historicity of the classical yeshiva. As indicated by the [[Talmud]],<ref>(Where in the Talmud, and in which Talmud (Bavli or Yerushalmi?)</ref> adults generally took off two months a year, [[Elul]] and [[Adar]], the months preceding the [[pilgrimage festivals]] of [[Sukkot]] and [[Pesach]], called ''Yar\u1e25ei Kalla'' ([[Aramaic]] for \"Months of Kallah\") to study. The rest of the year, they worked.\n\n===Geonic Period===\n[[File:Rabbi Ashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A depiction of [[Sura Academy|Sura]] (from [[Beit Hatefutsot]])]]\nThe Geonic period takes its name from [[Gaon (Hebrew)|''Gaon'']], the title bestowed on the heads of the three yeshivas in existence from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.\n\nThroughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot. These were named for the cities in which they were located: [[Jerusalem]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and [[Pumbedita]]; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to [[Cairo]], and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to [[Baghdad]], but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was however, no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded immense power as the principal body for interpreting [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. In this regard, the community saw the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. Those appointed as the head of a congregation would serve as a go-between for the local congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These local leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshivot were financially supported through a number of means. There were fixed, but voluntary, yearly contributions made to the yeshivas; these annual contributions were collected and handled by the local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, and could consist of money or goods.\n\nThe yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century. After the scattering of the yeshiva, education in Jewish religious studies became the responsibility of individual [[synagogues]]. No organization ever came to replace the three great yeshivot of Jerusalem, Sura and Pumbedita.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgement in One Volume |last=Goitein |first=S.D. |editor-last=Lassner |editor-first=Jacob |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520240599 |url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520240599/a-mediterranean-society |accessdate=2018-10-06}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Geonic Period to the 19th century===\nAfter the Geonic Period Jews went on to establishing more Yeshiva academies in Europe and in Northern Africa.

Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, the students who received ''[[semikhah]]'' (rabbinical ordination) would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere or join the workforce.\n\n====Lithuanian yeshivas====\n[[Image:Volozhin yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old photo of the Volozhin yeshiva]]\n[[File:Ponivez1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]]]] \nOrganised [[Torah study]] was revolutionised by [[Chaim Volozhin]], an influential 18th-century Lithuanian leader of Judaism and disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]]. In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater to those who were looking for more intensive study.\n\nWith the support of his teacher, Volozhin gathered a large number of interested students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Valozhyn]], located in modern-day [[Belarus]]. The [[Volozhin yeshiva]] was closed some 60 years later in 1892 due to the Russian government's demands for the introduction of certain secular studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schacter|first1=Jacob J. |title=Haskalah, Secular Studies and the Close of the Yeshiva in Volozhin in 1892 |jstor=40914771 |journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal |volume=2 |pages=76\u2013133 |date=1990}}</ref> Thereafter, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Slabodka]], [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisk]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. Many prominent contemporary ''yeshivot'' in the United States and [[Israel]] are continuations of these institutions, and often bear the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Israel Salanter]] initiated the [[Mussar movement]] in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and other emerging political ideologies (such as [[Zionism]]) that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment [[Talmudic]] study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts ([[mussar literature]]), as well as a new literature for the movement. By focusing the student on self-understanding and introspection, often with profound psychological insight, the spiritual aims of Judaism could be internalized.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshiva world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks (\"mussar shmues\"). A ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' (spiritual mentor) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the [[Hasidic Judaism]] world. Hasidism began in the previous century within traditional Jewish life in Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th Century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.\n\nSome variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and ''mussar'', for example whether the emphasis would be placed on ''beki'ut'' (breadth) or ''iyyun'' (depth). ''[[Pilpul]]'', a type of in-depth analytical and casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries that was traditionally reserved for the profound nuances of investigative Talmudic study, was not always given a place. The new analytical approach of the [[Brisker method]], developed by [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], has become widely popular; however, there are other approaches such as those of [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Chofetz Chaim]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In ''mussar'', different schools developed, such as Slabodka and [[Novardok Yeshiva|Novhardok]], though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.\n\n====Hasidic yeshivas====\n[[File:Breslov Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Breslov (Hasidic group) |Breslov]] Yeshiva in [[Mea Shearim]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\n[[Image:Satmer Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].]]\nWith the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on Talmudic literature that is central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], augmented by study of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] yeshiva system of [[Tomchei Temimim]], founded by [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]] in Russia in 1897, and the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] established in Poland in 1930 by [[Meir Shapiro]], who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the [[Daf Yomi]] daily cycle of Talmud study.\n\nIn many Hasidic yeshivas, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional ''[[devekut]]'' (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his [[Rebbe]] is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the [[Shabbat]] in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism. \n\nIn contrast, Chabad and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties' Hasidic texts in central focus; see [[#Ethics, mysticism and philosophy|below]]. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn's wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts \"with ''pilpul''\". The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], to systematically investigate and articulate the \"Torah of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]\" in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the \"Tract on Ecstasy\" by [[Dovber Schneuri]]) between general Hasidism's emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of [[Nachman of Breslov]] awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.\n\n====Sephardi yeshivas====\n:''See: [[:Category:Sephardic yeshivas]], as well the more complete, [[:he:\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea|\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea]]''\n[[File:Porat Yosef Yeshiva, Geula branch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Geula]] branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva.]]\nAlthough the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern [[Sephardi]] Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic [[madrasa]]s. In 19th-century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed? |accessdate=2018-10-06 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}</ref> Early educational institutions on the European model were [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]] founded in 1870s Iraq and [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.\n\nThe Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) in a more mainstream position than in the European [[Ashkenazi]] world. This difference of emphasis arose in reaction to the historical events of the [[Sabbatean]] heresy in the 17th Century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of the strength of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel after the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there]], some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. Nonetheless, the European prescriptions to reserve advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.\n\n===19th century to present===\n====Conservative movement yeshivas====\n[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|250px|thumb|JTS building in [[Manhattan]]]]\nIn 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] was founded. It was headed by [[Zecharias Frankel]], and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with \"positive-historical Judaism\", the predecessor of [[Conservative Judaism]]. In subsequent years, Conservative Judaism established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. However, many do not officially refer to themselves as \"yeshivas\" (one exception is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study ''lishmah'' (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.\n\n====Nondenominational or mixed yeshivas====\nNon-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to Conservative Judaism include [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in New York, the leaders of whom include [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members [[Elie Kaunfer]] and [[Shai Held]]. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] (AJR-CA) is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis.\nSee also [[Institute of Traditional Judaism]].\n\nAdditionally, Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary, developed and led by Conservative and Reform rabbis, offers a two-year online rabbinical ordination program with a \"post-denominational\" rabbinical ordination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishpluralism.org/ |title=Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary |publisher=PRS |date= January 23, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries====\n[[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), affiliated with [[Reform Judaism]], was founded in 1875 under the leadership of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], founded in Pennsylvania in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at non-denominational seminaries like the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, and the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College. In Europe, Reform Judaism trains rabbis at Leo Baeck College in London, UK and Abraham Geiger Kolleg in Potsdam, Germany. None of these institutions describes itself as a \"yeshiva\".\n\n====Contemporary Orthodox yeshivas====\n[[File:The old Beis Madrash Building of BMG.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Beth Medrash Govoha]], Lakewood, New Jersey -  largest yeshiva outside Israel.<ref name=LargestYeshivaOutsideIsrael>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2019/04/lakewood-yeshiva-looks-to-use-old-golf-course-for-new-campus.html|title=Lakewood yeshiva looks to use old golf course for new campus|author=Steve Strunsky|publisher=New Jersey On-Line LLC|date=April 16, 2019|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=Beth Medrash Gohova is said to be the world\u2019s largest Jewish-affiliated university outside of Israel.}}</ref><ref name=LargestYeshivaNorthAmerica>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/ocean/2017/08/11_ways_lakewood_is_like_nowhere_else_in_nj.html|title=10 ways Lakewood is unlike anywhere else in N.J.|author=Stephen Stirling|publisher=NJ Advance Media|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=The sea change can be pinned to one event: The founding of the Beth Medrash Govoha yeshiva in the mid-20th century.

The six-weeks-long semester is the shortest yet most intense session, as it comes before the High Holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and Yom Kippur.

The dual curriculum was pioneered by the Manhattan Talmudical Academy of [[Yeshiva University]] (now known as [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy]]) in 1916.\n#[[Mechina]] - For Israeli high-school graduates who wish to study for one year before entering the army. In [[Telshe yeshiva|Telshe]] yeshivas and in [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel|Ner Yisroel of Baltimore]], the Mesivtas/Yeshiva ketanas are known as Mechinas.\n#[[Beth Midrash]] - For high school graduates, and is attended from one year to many years, dependent on the career plans and affiliation of the student.\n#Yeshivat [[Hesder]] - Yeshiva that has an arrangement with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] by which the students enlist together in the same unit and, as much as is possible serve in the same unit in the army. Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva. The first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\n#[[Kollel]] - Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea has its intellectual roots in the Torah;  [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal learning. However, it is mostly a modern innovation of 19th-century Europe. A kollel will often be in the same location as the yeshiva.\n#[[Baal Teshuva]] yeshivot catering to the needs of the newly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].\nTraditionally, religious girls' schools are not called \"yeshiva.\" The [[Bais Yaakov]] system was started in 1918 under the guidance of [[Sarah Schenirer]]. This system provided girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skewed more toward practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) and the study of [[Tanakh]], rather than [[Talmud]]. Bais Yaakovs are strictly [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] schools. Non-Haredi girls' schools' curricula often includes the study of Mishnah and sometimes Talmud. They are also sometimes called \"yeshiva\" (e.g., Prospect Park Yeshiva).

The first is ''iyyun'' (in-depth study), often confined to selected legally focused tractates with an emphasis on analytical skills and close reference to the classical commentators; the second, ''beki'ut'', seeks to cover ground more speedily in order to build general knowledge of the Talmud.\n\nIn the yeshiva system of Talmudic study, the undergraduate yeshivot focus on eight ''[[Masekhet|mesechtohs]]'' ([[tractate]]s) that deal with civil jurisprudence (''[[Nezikin]]''); through them, the student can best master the [[Gemara #Argumentation and debate|proper technique of Talmudic analysis]]. After this technique is mastered, the student is ready to go on to other areas of the Talmud<ref name=\"Actually\"/> (see, for example, [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel #Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)]]). Tractates [[Berakhot (tractate)|''Berachot'']], [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Sukkah'']] and [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Pesachim'']] are often included.\n\nWorks initially studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by [[Rashi]], and  ''[[Tosafot]]'', a parallel analysis and critique.\nThe integration of Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot, is considered as foundational - and prerequisite - to further analysis (in fact, this combination is sometimes referred to by its own acronym, ''\"gefet\"''  \u05d2\u05e4\u05f4\u05ea - ''[[Gemara]]'',  ''perush Rashi'',  ''Tosafot''). The [[Super-commentary|super-commentaries]] by  [[Solomon Luria|\"Maharshal\"]], [[Meir Lublin|\"Maharam\"]] and [[Samuel Edels|\"Maharsha\"]] address the three together.\n\nAt more advanced levels, additional ''[[Talmud#Commentaries|mefarshim]]'' (commentators) are studied: other ''[[rishonim]]'', from the 11th to 14th centuries, as well as ''[[acharonim]]'', from later generations. (There are two main schools of ''rishonim'', from France and from Spain, who will hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud.) \nAt these levels, students link the Talmudic discussion to [[Halakha #Codes of Jewish law|codified law]] - particularly ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (i.e. [[Rambam]]), ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' - by studying, also, the halakha-focused commentaries of [[Asher_ben_Jehiel#Works|\"Rosh\"]], [[Isaac_Alfasi#Sefer_haHalachot|\"Rif\"]] and [[Mordechai_ben_Hillel#Magnum_opus|\"Mordechai\"]].\n\nIn general, as the [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|level of the ''shiur'']] progresses, so the student must integrate more of these commentaries into their analysis of the ''[[sugya]]'' (loosely, Talmudic  \"unit of analysis\");\nand understand their various implications re practical-halakha.\nAt the higher levels - in Lithuanian influenced Yeshivot - the \"[[Brisker method]]\" of analysis is employed, [[#Lithuanian yeshivas|as mentioned]].\nSome yeshivot - such as [[Yeshivat_Birkat_Moshe|Birkat Moshe]] - particularly emphasize the Rambam.\nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' delivers a weekly ''shiur klali'' (comprehensive lecture), which sums up the week's learning; this is attended by all levels.\n\nTypically, boys begin their study of Talmud in middle school, initially studying [[Mishnah]], the component of Talmud where the underlying \"cases\" are presented. (At this stage, they have completed their survey of ''Chumash''; see [[#Torah_and_Bible_study|below]].)\nIn early high school, ''[[gemara]]'', the analytic component, is introduced; by late high school some are able to work with ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Jewish law===\nGenerally, a period is devoted to the study of practical ''halakha''. The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazi yeshivot is the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', a compilation of ''halakhic'' opinions rendered after the time of the writing of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. \nIn Sephardic yeshivot, the ''Shulchan Aruch'' itself is more commonly studied, along with the [[Beit Yosef (book)|''Bet Yosef'']] commentary; the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' and [[Yaakov_Chaim_Sofer#Works|''Kaf Hachaim'']] are also often studied;  [[Yosef_Hayyim#Works|''Ben Ish Hai'']] is a standard reference.\nIn [[Chabad]] yeshivot,<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\"/> emphasis is placed upon study of ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''. Beginning students are encouraged to also work through the [[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch'']], so as to survey all areas of applicable Halacha.  Other students, similarly,  additionally review the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' through [[Daily Rambam Study|its daily study cycle]] (this is often outside of any ''seder''), here including  halachot relating to, for example, the Temple.\n\nStudents in ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) programs, and often those in [[kollel]], devote the largest portion of their schedule to ''halakha''.\nThe focus is in-depth study of those areas where (community) Rabbis will typically be asked ''\"shaylas\"'', or Halachik questions - [[Shabbat]], [[Kashrut]] (referred to as ''\"Issur v'Heter\"''), often [[Niddah]], sometimes  [[Bereavement in Judaism |Avelut]] - and their sources.\n<ref name=\"RCA\"/> \n<ref>[http://www.smicha.co.il/ smicha.co.il] - resource for the [[Chief_Rabbinate_of_Israel#Semikhah|Semikha of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], maintained by Rabbi [https://www.srugim.co.il/tag/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90 Harel Shapira]</ref> \n<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\">[http://rca.edu/media/pdf/1120/NbJg11207139.pdf ''CATALOG''], [[Rabbinical College of America]]</ref> \nThis entails the discussion of the ''halakha'' in the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''Bet Yosef'', through its final presentation in the ''Shulchan Aruch''; complemented by a study of key [[History of responsa in Judaism|''She'elot u-Teshuvot'']] ([[responsa]]), recent and historical.  \nThe underpin for this analysis is a deep knowledge of all relevant ''sugyas'', which are prepared accordingly within the schedule.\nStudents in a (Orthodox) Semikha program will thus have a strong background in Talmud, typically having spent at least four preceding years in Yeshiva;<ref name=\"RCA\">[http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/SemichaGuidelines22Dec2015.pdf ''Semicha Standards''], RCA Executive Committee, 2015.</ref> Kollel students likewise.\n(See [[Rabbi #Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism]],\n[[Posek #Formulating a ruling (psak din)]].)\nDuring the morning ''seder'', Semikha students continue their Talmud studies, learning the same ''masechet'' as the rest of the Yeshiva.\n\n===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===\nHaredi ''Yeshivot'' typically devote a ''seder'' to [[musar literature|''mussar'']] (ethics and character development). \nThe preeminent text studied is the ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'' (\"Path [of the] Just\") of [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. Other works of mussar literature studied include:\n*''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' (\"Paths [of the] Righteous\"); its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes [[Maimonides]], it was written some time after his works were disseminated.\n*''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (\"Duties of the Hearts\") by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].\n*''[[Ma'alot ha-Middot]]'' (\"Benefit [of good character] traits\") by [[Jehiel_ben_Jekuthiel_Anav|Jehiel Anav]]\n*''Mishnat R' Aharon'', Mussar Lectures on many topics by [[Aharon Kotler]].\n*''[[Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu|Mikhtav me-Eliyahu]]'', the works of [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]].\n\nHasidic yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of Hasidic philosophy (''Chassidus''). This draws on the earlier esoteric theology of ''[[Kabbalah]]'', but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional ''[[dveikus]]'' (cleaving to God) and spiritual contribution to daily Jewish life. This serves some similar purposes to ''mussar'', but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. Chabad yeshivot, for example, study the [[Tanya]], the [[Likutei Torah]], and the voluminous works of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch#The leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch|Rebbes of Chabad]] for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening. \nSee [[#Hasidic yeshivas|above]].\n\n[[#Sephardi yeshivas|As mentioned]], Sephardi ''yeshivot'' often incorporate study of selected Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum - [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|standard texts]], as well as works by [[Yosef Hayyim]], [[Yehuda Fatiyah]] and [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]]. Kabbalistic sources are brought in ''Halachik'' works such as ''Kaf Hachaim'' and ''Ben Ish Hai'' - see [[Sephardic law and customs #Lurianic Kabbalah]] - and are then studied indirectly also.\n\nIn Hesder, [[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot, ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish philosophy]] generalized / applied as \"[[Jewish thought]]\"; also ''[[Hashkafa]]'', \"worldview\") is taught formally, with classes systematically covering the [[Jewish_principles_of_faith|major topics]] and works (''[[Kuzari]], [[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nevukhim]], [[Sefer ha-Ikkarim]] , [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]], [[Derech Hashem]]'' and others). Hesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], \"Rav Kook\", who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy. The Modern Orthodox, similarly, study the works of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], \"Rav Soloveitchik\".\nHasidic philosophy and Mussar are also often taught; ''[[Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel#Jewish_philosophy|Maharal]]'' may have a dedicated ''shiur''. Machshava is also a focus-area of many ''Midrashot''.\n\nSome Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas also include formal study of ''Hashkafa'', especially at ''[[ba'al teshuva]]'' focused yeshivas; many ''Semikha'' programs likewise, particularly those with an outreach, or \"''[[kiruv]]''\", component. Regardless, students here typically study the major works independent of a ''shiur''.\n\n===Torah and Bible study===\nIntensive study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Torah) with the commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi 1040 - 1105) is stressed and taught in all elementary grades.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> In Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, this is often done with Yiddish translations. The rest of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible, comprising ''[[Nevi'im]]'' and ''[[Ketuvim]]'') is usually taught through high school, although less intensively. \n\nIn Yeshivot, thereafter,  Chumash and Tanakh are studied less directly. Yeshiva students typically follow the practice of ''[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]'', independently studying the upcoming ''[[parashah]]'' ([[weekly Torah portion]]) twice in the original Hebrew and once in [[Targum Onkelos]] (an [[Aramaic]] translation), with Rashi's commentary. Students often also study [[Nachmanides#Commentary_on_the_Torah|Ramban's commentary]], and, less often, other commentaries from the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' edition are reviewed. \nStudents may similarly study the Tanakh independently, but it is not taught ''per se''; exceptions are the five [[Megilloth]] and [[Psalms|Tehillim]]. \nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' usually delivers a weekly ''shiur'' on the ''parashah'', which is often [[Shiur (Torah)#Public study sessions|open to the public]]. \n\nBy contrast, in Hesder and Modern Orthodox yeshivot, the study of Chumash and Tanakh continues in parallel with Talmud study. These institutions offer formal ''shiurim'' in many, if not all, of the books of Nevi'im  and Ketuvim. These are often structured [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|by level]], similar to Talmud study, where the text is then analyzed in light of the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|various commentaries]] and [[Midrash#Classical_compilations|''Midrashim'']], typically complementing the ''Machshavah'' ''shiurim''. \n[[Oral_Torah#In_rabbinic_literature_and_commentary|More recent commentaries]] especially studied are ''[[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin#Bibliography|\"Netziv\"]]'' and  ''[[Malbim#Methodology and style|\"Malbim\"]]''; as well as reference works such as ''[[Da'at Miqra]]'' by [[Mordechai Breuer]] and others.\nThe commentaries by Ramban and [[Samson_Raphael_Hirsch#Commentary_on_the_Torah|\"Rav Hirsch\"]] provide much philosophical content.\nIntensive study of Tanakh, as for Machshava, is similarly a feature of many ''Midrashot''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bais Yaakov]]\n* [[Jewish day school]]\n* [[Mesivta]]\n* [[Religious school]]\n* [[Yeshivish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States |Religious education}}\n\n[[Category:Yeshivas| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish education]]\n[[Category:Jewish religious occupations]]\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Single-gender schools]]\n", "name_user": "Fintor", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIsrael", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshiva"}

Adult goshawks may chatter a repeated note, varying in speed and volume based on the context. When calling from a perch, birds often turn their heads slowly from side to side, producing a ventriloquial effect.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name= Ferguson-Lees/> The male calls a fast, high-pitched ''kew-kew-kew'' when delivering food or else a very different croaking ''guck'' or ''chup''. The latter sound has been considered by some authors similar to that of a person snapping the tongue away from the roof the mouth; the males produce it by holding the beak wide open, thrusting the head up and forward, than bringing it down as the sound is emitted, repeated at intervals of five seconds. This call is uttered when the male encounters a female.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Cornell/> Two calls have been recorded mainly from brooding females in the race ''A. g. atricapillus'': a recognition scream of short, intense notes (''whee-o'' or ''hee-ya'') which ends in harsh, falsetto tone; then a dismissal call given when the male lingers after delivering food, consisting of a choked, cut-off scream.<ref name=\"Brown\"/> Meanwhile, the adult female's rapid strident ''kek-kek-kek'' expresses alarm or intent to mob towards threatening intruders. This is often done when mobbing a predator such as a [[great horned owl]] (''Bubo virginianus'') and as it progresses the female's voice may lower slightly in pitch and becomes harsh and rasping. As the intensity of her attacks increases, her kakking becomes more rapid and can attain a constant screaming quality. Females often withdraw into the treetops when fatigued, and their calls are then spaced at longer intervals. Males respond to interlopers or predators with a quieter, slower ''gek gek gek'' or ''ep ep ep''. A call consisting of ''kek\u2026kek.kekk kek kek-kek-kek'' is used mainly by females in advertisement and during pre-laying mutual calling. Both sexes also may engage in kakking during copulation.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Cornell/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Gromme |first=O.

All told 33 species of this order have turned up in their diet, including most of the species either native to or introduced in North America and Europe. Numerically, only in the well-studied [[taiga]] habitats of [[Scandinavia]], [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] and some areas of the [[eastern United States]] do grouse typically take a dominant position. Elsewhere in the range, gamebirds are often secondary in number but often remain one of the most important contributors of prey biomass to nests. With their general ground-dwelling habits, gamebirds tend to be fairly easy for goshawks to overtake if they remain unseen and, if made aware of the goshawk, the prey chooses to run rather than fly. If frightened too soon, gamebirds may take flight and may be chased for some time, although the capture rates are reduced considerably when this occurs. Pre-fledgling chicks of gamebirds are particularly vulnerable due to the fact that they can only run when being pursued.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name= Kenward/> In several parts of [[Scandinavia]], forest grouse have historically been important prey for goshawks both in and out of the nesting season, principally the {{convert|1080|g|lb|abbr=on}} [[black grouse]] (''Tetrao tetrix'') and the {{convert|430|g|oz|abbr=on}} [[hazel grouse]] (''Bonasa bonasia'') followed in numbers by larger {{convert|2950|g|lb|abbr=on}} [[western capercaillie]]s (''Tetrao urogallus'') and the {{convert|570|g|lb|abbr=on}} [[willow ptarmigan]] (''Lagopus lagopus'') which replace the other species in the lower tundra zone. The impression of goshawks on the populations of this prey is considerable, possibly the most impactful of any predator in northern Europe considering their proficiency as predators and similarity of habitat selection to forest grouse. An estimated 25-26% of adult hazel grouses in Finnish and Swedish populations in a few studies fall victim to goshawks, whereas about 14% of adult black grouse are lost to this predator. Lesser numbers were reportedly culled in one study from northern [[Finland]]. However, adult grouse are less important in the breeding season diet than young birds, an estimated 30% of grouse taken by Scandinavian goshawks in summer were neonatal chicks whereas 53% were about fledgling age, the remaining 17% being adult grouse.<ref name= Kenward/><ref name= \"CRC\"/><ref name= Widen>Widen, P.

About a dozen mammalian and avian predators in each area all primarily consume [[European rabbit]]s and [[snowshoe hare]]s alongside goshawks in the Iberian peninsula and the American boreal forest regions where these became primary staple foods. Like those co-habitant predators, the goshawk suffers declines during the low portion in the lagomorph's breeding cycles, which rise and fall cyclically every 10 to 12 years. However, even where these are primary food sources, the northern goshawk is less specialized than many (even ''[[Horned owl|Bubo]]'' owls, some of the more generalist avian predators become extremely specialized lagomorph hunters locally, to a greater extent than goshawks) and can alternate their food selection, often taking equal or greater numbers of tree squirrels and woodland birds. Due to this dietary variation, the northern goshawk is less affected than other raptorial birds by prey population cycles and tends to not be depleted by resource competition.<ref name= Doyle/><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Krebs |first1= C.

The most deadly are likely to be the [[Eurasian eagle owl]] and the [[great horned owl]], which not only predate goshawks of any age and at any season but also opportunistically take over their own prior nests as their own nesting site.<ref name= Kenward/> Of the two, the American horned owl nesting habits are more similar to goshawks, which most often consists of tree nests whereas the eagle owl usually nests in rock formations. Thus, the northern goshawk is more likely to victimized by the great horned owls, which can stage nightly ambushes and destroy an entire goshawk family as they pick off both adults and nestlings.<ref name= Cornell/> In radio-tagging studies of adult and immature goshawks in the [[Great Lakes]] region and [[Arizona]], up to half of the studied birds were killed by great horned owls at night, while the horned owls accounted for 40% of the nest failures in studies from Arizona and [[New Mexico]].<ref name= Boal/><ref name= Ward>Ward, J.

Accipiter gentilis - Flickr - gailhampshire.jpg|thumb|right|The mother goshawk seldom leaves the nest in either the incubation or the brooding stage, until the young are about 2 weeks.]]\nDuring incubation, females tend to become quieter and more inconspicuous. The mother can develop a brooding patch of up to {{convert|15|by|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} on her underside. She may turn the eggs as frequently as every 30 to 60 minutes. Males may incubate as many as 1 to 3 hours, but usually less than an hour, early in incubation but rarely do so later on. During daylight females can do as much as 96% of the observed incubation. The incubation stage last for any time between 28 and 37 days (rarely up to 41 days in exceptionally big clutches), varying in different parts of the range.<ref name= Cornell/><ref name= Cramp/><ref name= Beebe/><ref name= Wight/> After hatching occurs, the male does not come directly to the nest but instead just delivers food (usually already plucked, beheaded or otherwise dismembered) to a branch near the nest which the female tears apart and shares between herself and the nestlings.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name= Kenward/><ref name= Holstein/> Food deliveries by the male can be daily or as infrequent as every 3 to 5 days. In turn, the female must feed the young about twice a day in order for the chicks to avoid starvation. Caching of food has been recorded near the nest, but only before the young start feeding themselves. Food deliveries must average about {{convert|250|to|320|g|oz|abbr=on}} per young goshawk per day for them to successfully fledge, or {{convert|700|to|950|g|lb|abbr=on}} total daily and {{convert|60|to|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} throughout the season for an average sized clutch of around three. Females will also start capturing prey later on, but usually only after the young have already fledged.<ref name= Kenward/><ref name= Schnell/><ref name= Rutz/> In [[Europe]], female goshawks may press down on their nest if a human approaches, others may unobtrusively leave the nest, although are more reluctant to leave the nest late in incubation. In [[North America]], the behavior of parent goshawks differs, as they often vigorously defend their territories fiercely from all intruders, including passing humans. The northern goshawk has a reputation as the most aggressive American raptor when the vicinity of their nest is approached. Here, when the nest is approached (especially soon after hatching) the goshawk will engage in their defensive kakking vocal display accompanied by exaggerated swooping in flight which quickly phases into a violent attack, potentially causing painful (but usually minor) injuries and blood loss. Research has indicated that attacks on humans are mostly done by adult females (more than 80% of the time) and are rarely pressed unless a person is by themselves. However, large groups and loud noise can appear to irritate the female and may cause her to attack the next lone person who comes near the nest. The higher aggression towards humans in North America than in Europe has been linked to both a more extensive range of potential nest predators for American goshawks causing them to develop a more aggressive display or the lower rates of persecution in America than in Europe, which may account for the relative shyness in the latter continent.<ref name= Kenward/><ref name= Rashid/><ref name= Speiser/><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Parker |first1= J.

Hatchlings measure about {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} long at first and grow about {{convert|5|to|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length each week until they fledge. The mothers typically brood the nestlings intensively for about two weeks, around the time grayer feathers start to develop through the nestlings\u2019 down. The most key time for development may be at three weeks when the nestlings can stand a bit and start to develop their flight feathers. Also at the three-week stage, they can reach about half the adults\u2019 weight and females start to noticeably outgrow the males. However, this growth requires increased food delivery so frequently results in lower nest attendance and, in turn, higher predation rates. Also rates of starvation at this stage can exceed 50% especially in the youngest of large clutches of 4 to 5.<ref name= Kenward/><ref name= Rashid/><ref name= Siewert>{{cite journal |last1= Siewert |first1= H |year= 1933 |title= Die Brutbiologie des Huhnerhabichts |url= |journal= Journal f\u00fcr Ornithologie |volume= 81 |issue= |pages= 44\u201394 |doi=10.1007/bf01932166}}</ref><ref name= Boal2>{{cite journal |last1= Boal |first1= C.

More active feeding behavior by nestlings may increase their aggression towards each other. By the 5th week, they've developed many typical goshawk behaviors, sometimes mantling over food, testing balance by extending one leg and one wing at edge of nest (called \"warbling\" by falconers) and can wag their tails vigorously. Starvation risk also increases at this point due to their growing demands and, due to their incessant begging calls, vocal activity may court predators. In 6th week, they become \"branchers\", although still spend much of the time by the nest, especially by the edge. The young goshawks \"play\" by seizing and striking violent at a perch or by yanking off leaves and tossing them over their back. Wing feathers do not develop highly dimorphically, but male branchers are better developed than females who have more growing to do and can leave the nest up to 1\u20133 days sooner. The young rarely return to the nest after being 35 to 46 days of age and start their first flight another 10 days later, thus becoming full fledglings.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name= Kenward/><ref name= Siewert/><ref name= Boal2/> Goshawk nestlings frequently engage in \u201crunting\u201d, wherein the older siblings push aside and call more loudly and are thus are feed more often at food deliveries, until the younger siblings may either starve to death, be trampled or killed by their siblings (referred to as [[siblicide]] or \u201ccainism\u201d). There is some evidence that mother goshawks may lessen the effects of runting by delaying incubation until their last eggs are laid. Food supply may be linked to higher rates of siblicides and, in many locations with consistent prey levels, runting and siblicide can occur somewhat seldomly (meaning the northern goshawk is a \u201cfacultative\u201d rather than \u201cobligate cainist\u201d).<ref name= Kenward/><ref name= Siewert/><ref name= Segarra>Manosa, S.

Adult goshawks may chatter a repeated note, varying in speed and volume based on the context. When calling from a perch, birds often turn their heads slowly from side to side, producing a ventriloquial effect.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name= Ferguson-Lees/> The male calls a fast, high-pitched ''kew-kew-kew'' when delivering food or else a very different croaking ''guck'' or ''chup''. The latter sound has been considered by some authors similar to that of a person snapping the tongue away from the roof the mouth; the males produce it by holding the beak wide open, thrusting the head up and forward, than bringing it down as the sound is emitted, repeated at intervals of five seconds. This call is uttered when the male encounters a female.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Cornell/> Two calls have been recorded mainly from brooding females in the race ''A. g. atricapillus'': a recognition scream of short, intense notes (''whee-o'' or ''hee-ya'') which ends in harsh, falsetto tone; then a dismissal call given when the male lingers after delivering food, consisting of a choked, cut-off scream.<ref name=\"Brown\"/> Meanwhile, the adult female's rapid strident ''kek-kek-kek'' expresses alarm or intent to mob towards threatening intruders. This is often done when mobbing a predator such as a [[great horned owl]] (''Bubo virginianus'') and as it progresses the female's voice may lower slightly in pitch and becomes harsh and rasping. As the intensity of her attacks increases, her kakking becomes more rapid and can attain a constant screaming quality. Females often withdraw into the treetops when fatigued, and their calls are then spaced at longer intervals. Males respond to interlopers or predators with a quieter, slower ''gek gek gek'' or ''ep ep ep''. A call consisting of ''kek\u2026kek.kekk kek kek-kek-kek'' is used mainly by females in advertisement and during pre-laying mutual calling. Both sexes also may engage in kakking during copulation.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Cornell/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Gromme |first=O.

All told 33 species of this order have turned up in their diet, including most of the species either native to or introduced in North America and Europe. Numerically, only in the well-studied [[taiga]] habitats of [[Scandinavia]], [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] and some areas of the [[eastern United States]] do grouse typically take a dominant position. Elsewhere in the range, gamebirds are often secondary in number but often remain one of the most important contributors of prey biomass to nests. With their general ground-dwelling habits, gamebirds tend to be fairly easy for goshawks to overtake if they remain unseen and, if made aware of the goshawk, the prey chooses to run rather than fly. If frightened too soon, gamebirds may take flight and may be chased for some time, although the capture rates are reduced considerably when this occurs. Pre-fledgling chicks of gamebirds are particularly vulnerable due to the fact that they can only run when being pursued.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name= Kenward/> In several parts of [[Scandinavia]], forest grouse have historically been important prey for goshawks both in and out of the nesting season, principally the {{convert|1080|g|lb|abbr=on}} [[black grouse]] (''Tetrao tetrix'') and the {{convert|430|g|oz|abbr=on}} [[hazel grouse]] (''Bonasa bonasia'') followed in numbers by larger {{convert|2950|g|lb|abbr=on}} [[western capercaillie]]s (''Tetrao urogallus'') and the {{convert|570|g|lb|abbr=on}} [[willow ptarmigan]] (''Lagopus lagopus'') which replace the other species in the lower tundra zone. The impression of goshawks on the populations of this prey is considerable, possibly the most impactful of any predator in northern Europe considering their proficiency as predators and similarity of habitat selection to forest grouse. An estimated 25-26% of adult hazel grouses in Finnish and Swedish populations in a few studies fall victim to goshawks, whereas about 14% of adult black grouse are lost to this predator. Lesser numbers were reportedly culled in one study from northern [[Finland]]. However, adult grouse are less important in the breeding season diet than young birds, an estimated 30% of grouse taken by Scandinavian goshawks in summer were neonatal chicks whereas 53% were about fledgling age, the remaining 17% being adult grouse.<ref name= Kenward/><ref name= \"CRC\"/><ref name= Widen>Widen, P.

E. Lodge]]]]\nNorthern goshawks can be locally heavy predators of [[lagomorph]]s, of which they take at least 15 species as prey. Especially in the [[Iberian peninsula]], the native [[European rabbit]] (''Oryctolagus cuniculus'') is often delivered to nests and can be the most numerous prey. Even where taken secondarily in numbers in Spain to gamebirds such as in [[Segarra|La Segarra]], [[Spain]], rabbits tend to be the most significant contributor of biomass to goshawk nests. On average, the weight of rabbits taken in La Segarra was {{convert|662|g|lb|abbr=on}} (making up 38.4% of the prey biomass there), indicating most of the 333 rabbits taken there were yearlings and about 2-3 times lighter than a prime adult wild rabbit.<ref name= Ma\u00f1osa/><ref name= Zuberogoitia/> In [[England]], where the European rabbit is an introduced species, it was the third most numerous prey species at nests.<ref name= Marquiss/> In more snowbound areas where wild and feral rabbits are absent, larger [[hare]]s may be taken and while perhaps more difficult to subdue than most typical goshawk prey, are a highly nutritious food source. In [[Finland]], females were found to take [[mountain hare]] (''Lepus timidus'') fairly often and they were the second most numerous prey item for goshawks in winter (14.8% by number).<ref name= Tornberg/> In [[North America]], where mammals are more important in the diet, more lagomorphs are taken. In [[Oregon]], [[snowshoe hare]]s (''Lepus americanus'') are the largest contributor of biomass to goshawks foods (making up to 36.6% of the prey by weight), in eastern Oregon at least 60% of hares taken were adults weighing on average {{convert|1500|g|lb|abbr=on}}, and in one of three studies from Oregon be the most numerous prey species (second most numerous in the other two).<ref name= Reynolds/><ref name= Watson/> This species was also the second most numerous food species in Alberta throughout the year and the most important prey by weight.<ref name= Schaffer/> [[Eastern cottontail]]s (''Sylvilagus floridanus''), also averaging some {{convert|1500|g|lb|abbr=on}} in mass per the study (and thus mostly consisting of adult cottontails in their prime), were the most significant prey both by weight (42.3%) and number (13.3%) in [[Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest]] of [[Arizona]].

Despite historic claims that taking prey so considerably larger than themselves is exceptional beyond a small region of [[Fennoscandia]], there is evidence that as grouse numbers have mysteriously declined since 1960, adult mountain hare are increasingly the leading prey for wintering female goshawks, favoring and causing an increase of larger bodied females in order to overpower such a substantial catch.<ref name= Kenward/><ref name= Kenward2>{{cite journal |last1= Kenward |first1= R.

About a dozen mammalian and avian predators in each area all primarily consume [[European rabbit]]s and [[snowshoe hare]]s alongside goshawks in the Iberian peninsula and the American boreal forest regions where these became primary staple foods. Like those co-habitant predators, the goshawk suffers declines during the low portion in the lagomorph's breeding cycles, which rise and fall cyclically every 10 to 12 years. However, even where these are primary food sources, the northern goshawk is less specialized than many (even ''[[Horned owl|Bubo]]'' owls, some of the more generalist avian predators become extremely specialized lagomorph hunters locally, to a greater extent than goshawks) and can alternate their food selection, often taking equal or greater numbers of tree squirrels and woodland birds. Due to this dietary variation, the northern goshawk is less affected than other raptorial birds by prey population cycles and tends to not be depleted by resource competition.<ref name= Doyle/><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Krebs |first1= C.

The latter species much more readily nests in semi-open and developed areas of North America than goshawks there and hunts a broad assemblage of medium-sized birds, whereas such prey is more readily available to male goshawks from Europe than to goshawks in North America.

Accipiter gentilis - Flickr - gailhampshire.jpg|thumb|right|The mother goshawk seldom leaves the nest in either the incubation or the brooding stage, until the young are about 2 weeks.]]\nDuring incubation, females tend to become quieter and more inconspicuous. The mother can develop a brooding patch of up to {{convert|15|by|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} on her underside. She may turn the eggs as frequently as every 30 to 60 minutes. Males may incubate as many as 1 to 3 hours, but usually less than an hour, early in incubation but rarely do so later on. During daylight females can do as much as 96% of the observed incubation. The incubation stage last for any time between 28 and 37 days (rarely up to 41 days in exceptionally big clutches), varying in different parts of the range.<ref name= Cornell/><ref name= Cramp/><ref name= Beebe/><ref name= Wight/> After hatching occurs, the male does not come directly to the nest but instead just delivers food (usually already plucked, beheaded or otherwise dismembered) to a branch near the nest which the female tears apart and shares between herself and the nestlings.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name= Kenward/><ref name= Holstein/> Food deliveries by the male can be daily or as infrequent as every 3 to 5 days. In turn, the female must feed the young about twice a day in order for the chicks to avoid starvation. Caching of food has been recorded near the nest, but only before the young start feeding themselves. Food deliveries must average about {{convert|250|to|320|g|oz|abbr=on}} per young goshawk per day for them to successfully fledge, or {{convert|700|to|950|g|lb|abbr=on}} total daily and {{convert|60|to|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} throughout the season for an average sized clutch of around three. Females will also start capturing prey later on, but usually only after the young have already fledged.<ref name= Kenward/><ref name= Schnell/><ref name= Rutz/> In [[Europe]], female goshawks may press down on their nest if a human approaches, others may unobtrusively leave the nest, although are more reluctant to leave the nest late in incubation. In [[North America]], the behavior of parent goshawks differs, as they often vigorously defend their territories fiercely from all intruders, including passing humans. The northern goshawk has a reputation as the most aggressive American raptor when the vicinity of their nest is approached. Here, when the nest is approached (especially soon after hatching) the goshawk will engage in their defensive kakking vocal display accompanied by exaggerated swooping in flight which quickly phases into a violent attack, potentially causing painful (but usually minor) injuries and blood loss. Research has indicated that attacks on humans are mostly done by adult females (more than 80% of the time) and are rarely pressed unless a person is by themselves. However, large groups and loud noise can appear to irritate the female and may cause her to attack the next lone person who comes near the nest. The higher aggression towards humans in North America than in Europe has been linked to both a more extensive range of potential nest predators for American goshawks causing them to develop a more aggressive display or the lower rates of persecution in America than in Europe, which may account for the relative shyness in the latter continent.<ref name= Kenward/><ref name= Rashid/><ref name= Speiser/><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Parker |first1= J.

Hatchlings measure about {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} long at first and grow about {{convert|5|to|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length each week until they fledge. The mothers typically brood the nestlings intensively for about two weeks, around the time grayer feathers start to develop through the nestlings\u2019 down. The most key time for development may be at three weeks when the nestlings can stand a bit and start to develop their flight feathers. Also at the three-week stage, they can reach about half the adults\u2019 weight and females start to noticeably outgrow the males. However, this growth requires increased food delivery so frequently results in lower nest attendance and, in turn, higher predation rates.

More active feeding behavior by nestlings may increase their aggression towards each other. By the 5th week, they've developed many typical goshawk behaviors, sometimes mantling over food, testing balance by extending one leg and one wing at edge of nest (called \"warbling\" by falconers) and can wag their tails vigorously. Starvation risk also increases at this point due to their growing demands and, due to their incessant begging calls, vocal activity may court predators. In 6th week, they become \"branchers\", although still spend much of the time by the nest, especially by the edge. The young goshawks \"play\" by seizing and striking violent at a perch or by yanking off leaves and tossing them over their back. Wing feathers do not develop highly dimorphically, but male branchers are better developed than females who have more growing to do and can leave the nest up to 1\u20133 days sooner. The young rarely return to the nest after being 35 to 46 days of age and start their first flight another 10 days later, thus becoming full fledglings.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name= Kenward/><ref name= Siewert/><ref name= Boal2/> Goshawk nestlings frequently engage in \u201crunting\u201d, wherein the older siblings push aside and call more loudly and are thus are feed more often at food deliveries, until the younger siblings may either starve to death, be trampled or killed by their siblings (referred to as [[siblicide]] or \u201ccainism\u201d). There is some evidence that mother goshawks may lessen the effects of runting by delaying incubation until their last eggs are laid. Food supply may be linked to higher rates of siblicides and, in many locations with consistent prey levels, runting and siblicide can occur somewhat seldomly (meaning the northern goshawk is a \u201cfacultative\u201d rather than \u201cobligate cainist\u201d).<ref name= Kenward/><ref name= Siewert/><ref name= Segarra>Manosa, S.

The first twenty of these large engines were built in 1929, designated T1a class and allocated numbers 5900 to 5919. Their Canadian type name was after the [[Selkirk Mountains]] across which they were placed in service, the railway summit of which was located just inside the western portal of the [[Connaught Tunnel]] beneath [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]].<ref name=Atkins>{{cite book| first=C.P., B.Sc.| last=Atkins| title=Loco Profile 35: Canadian Pacific Selkirks| publisher=Profile Publications Ltd.| location=Windsor, England| year=1973}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Canadian Pacific Selkirk class 5927 takes on oil at the South Edmonton shops.jpg|thumb|Canadian Pacific T1b, 1957]]\nMLW built another ten of these successful locomotives for CP during November and December 1938, designated T1b class and numbered from 5920 to 5929. Modifications to the original design led to the T1b being ten tonnes lighter while its operating steam pressure was increased from {{convert|275|to|285|psi|abbr=off}}.<ref name=Atkins/>\n\nA further six Selkirks, classed T1c and numbered from 5930 to 5935, were delivered by MLW in 1949. They were the last [[standard gauge]] steam locomotives to be built in Canada for a Canadian railway. These were very similar to the T1b class, apart from a few refinements which included two cross-compound air compressors to speed up recharging of the air brake system, while some small streamlining touches were not retained, such as the streamlined casing around the smokebox stack as well as the teardrop shape of the classification lights. In addition, the inside of the cabs were no longer insulated in the same manner as the previous versions, which had provided better cold-weather cab insulation and were better-liked by crews. The last Selkirks were taken out of service in 1959. These were the most powerful steam locomotives in the British Empire. <ref name=Atkins/>\n\n===South Africa===\n[[File:Class 21 no. 2551 (2-10-4) a.jpg|thumb|left|[[South African Class 21 2-10-4|SAR Class 21]], c. 1937]]\nIn 1937, the South African Railways (SAR) placed one {{Track gauge|Cape|allk=on}} [[South African Class 21 2-10-4|Class 21]] steam locomotive with a Texas wheel arrangement in service, designed as a mixed traffic locomotive suitable for light rail. It was designed by A.G. Watson, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1929 to 1936, and built by the [[North British Locomotive Company]] in Glasgow. Only the one locomotive was built, at the time representing the maximum power obtainable on Cape gauge from a ten-coupled non-articulated locomotive that was limited to a {{convert|15|LT|t|1|abbr=off}} axle load on {{convert|60|lb/yd|kg/m|abbr=off}} rail.

One, the [[Soviet locomotive class OR23|class OR23]], built in 1949 by the locomotive works in [[Ulan Ude]], had cylinders that were placed above the center driving axle. Unlike nearly all steam locomotives, the pistons had rods on both ends which transferred power to the wheels. The idea was to balance the driving forces on the wheels, allowing the counterweights on the wheels to be smaller and reducing [[hammer blow]] on the track. Test runs showed, however, that the OR23 design was unsuitable as a practical locomotive. The locomotive was never used for more than testing and was returned to its builder  and scrapped.<ref name=Russia/>\n\n===United States of America===\n\n====Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe====\nThe [[Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway]] (ATSF) took delivery of locomotive no. 3829 from the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] in 1919. It was used by Santa Fe as an experimental locomotive and was rostered as a member of ATSF\u2019s 3800 class of 2-10-2s that was fitted with a four-wheel trailing truck. Nearly a hundred more 3800 class locomotives were delivered after no. 3829, but all with the 2-10-2 wheel arrangement. Photographs exist that show no. 3829 fitted with at least two different designs of four-wheel trailing truck through the years. No other members of the 3800 class have been documented with four-wheel trailing trucks. No. 3829 was scrapped in 1955, still equipped with a four-wheel trailing truck.<ref>{{cite book|last=Worley|first=E. D.|date=1965|title=Iron Horses of the Santa Fe Trail|publisher=Southwest Railroad Historical Society|page=340|lccn=75-39813}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ATSF 5000 Madam Queen.jpg|thumb|[[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|ATSF]] {{nowrap|2-10-4}} No. 5000 ''Madame Queen'']]Santa Fe, who had originated the {{nowrap|2-10-4}} type, adopted it again in 1930 with [[Santa Fe 5000|no. 5000]], nicknamed ''Madame Queen''. This locomotive was similar to the C&O T-1, with the same {{convert|69|inch|mm|0|abbr=off}} drivers but with {{convert|300|psi|abbr=off}} boiler pressure and 60% limited cutoff. It proved the viability of the type on the Santa Fe railway, but the [[Great Depression]] shelved plans to acquire more.\n\nIn 1938, with the railroad's fortunes improving, Santa Fe acquired ten more {{nowrap|2-10-4}} locomotives. These came with {{convert|74|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} diameter drivers and {{convert|310|psi|abbr=off}} boiler pressure, making these ATSF {{nowrap|2-10-4}}s the fastest and most modern of all.\n\nOf the original order of ten, five were oil-burning and five coal-burning, but when Santa Fe ordered twenty-five more for delivery in 1944, all were delivered equipped to burn oil. The first of the 1944 batch produced 5600 drawbar horsepower on road test, the highest figure known for a two-cylinder steam locomotive.\n\n====Texas and Pacific====\nThe {{nowrap|2-10-4}} type was revived in 1925 by the [[Lima Locomotive Works]]. This time it was an expansion of the [[2-8-4|{{nowrap|2-8-4}} Berkshire]] type that Lima had pioneered. A version of the Berkshire with ten driving wheels instead of eight was an obvious development and the first to be delivered were to the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]], after which the type was subsequently named. The four-wheel trailing truck allowed a much larger firebox and thus a greater ability to generate heat, and thus steam. The [[Superpower steam|''Superpower'']] design, as Lima's marketing department called it, resulted in a locomotive that could develop great power at speed while not running out of steam-generating ability.\n\n====Chesapeake & Ohio====\nThe early Lima-built Texas types were low-drivered, {{convert|60|to|64|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} in diameter, which did not leave enough space to fully counterweight the extremely heavy and sturdy [[side rod]]s and [[main rod]]s required for such a powerful locomotive's piston thrusts. That changed in 1930 on the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O), who stretched the design of an [[Erie Railroad]] high-drivered Berkshire type locomotive to produce forty of the {{nowrap|C&O T-1}}, a Texas type with {{convert|69|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} diameter drivers that was both powerful and fast enough for the new higher-speed freight services that the railroads were introducing. All subsequent Texas types were of this higher-drivered sort.\n\n====Pennsylvania====\nThe [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR) ordered few new locomotives after 1930, since [[electrification]] both consumed the railroad's resources and resulted in a supply of excess steam locomotives that eliminated any requirement for new power. It was not until the [[Second World War]] had begun, that the PRR's locomotive fleet began to appear inadequate. Although the PRR urgently needed new and modern freight power, the [[War Production Board]] prohibited working on a new design and, since there was not enough time to trial a prototype in any event, the PRR cast around for other railroads' designs that it might modify for PRR use.\n\nIt settled on the {{nowrap|C&O\u2019s T-1}}. Some modifications were made to the design for these PRR ''War Babies''. These included PRR drop-couplers, sheet steel [[pilot (locomotive)|pilots]], PRR-style [[Control car (rail)|cabs]], large PRR [[tender (locomotive)|tenders]], [[Keystone (steam automobile)|Keystone]] number plates up front and other modifications. It still betrayed its foreign heritage by lacking the PRR trademark [[Belpaire firebox]] and by having a [[booster engine]] on the trailing truck. Altogether 125 locomotives were built between 1942 and 1944 and became the largest fleet of Texas type locomotives in existence. All were eventually sold as scrap when the Pennsylvania Railroad dieselized.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carlson, Neil. |title=Toward the 2-10-4 |journal=Classic Trains Magazine (Fall 2010)|publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing|Kalmbach]] |year=2010 |volume=11 |issue=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Farrell, Jack W.|title=North American steam locomotives: The Berkshire and Texas types|year=1989|publisher=Pacific Fast Mail, Edmonds, WA|isbn=0-915713-15-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Westcott|first=Lynn.

In South America, the Central Railway of Brazil ordered seventeen {{Track gauge|metre|allk=on}} {{nowrap|2-10-4}} locomotives, ten from [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] which were delivered in 1940, and another seven from the [[American Locomotive Company]] which were delivered in 1947.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Canada===\nThe Canadian Pacific (CP) [[Selkirk locomotive]]s were all built by [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] (MLW). The first twenty of these large engines were built in 1929, designated T1a class and allocated numbers 5900 to 5919. Their Canadian type name was after the [[Selkirk Mountains]] across which they were placed in service, the railway summit of which was located just inside the western portal of the [[Connaught Tunnel]] beneath [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]].<ref name=Atkins>{{cite book| first=C.P., B.Sc.| last=Atkins| title=Loco Profile 35: Canadian Pacific Selkirks| publisher=Profile Publications Ltd.| location=Windsor, England| year=1973}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Canadian Pacific Selkirk class 5927 takes on oil at the South Edmonton shops.jpg|thumb|Canadian Pacific T1b, 1957]]\nMLW built another ten of these successful locomotives for CP during November and December 1938, designated T1b class and numbered from 5920 to 5929. Modifications to the original design led to the T1b being ten tonnes lighter while its operating steam pressure was increased from {{convert|275|to|285|psi|abbr=off}}.<ref name=Atkins/>\n\nA further six Selkirks, classed T1c and numbered from 5930 to 5935, were delivered by MLW in 1949. They were the last [[standard gauge]] steam locomotives to be built in Canada for a Canadian railway. These were very similar to the T1b class, apart from a few refinements which included two cross-compound air compressors to speed up recharging of the air brake system, while some small streamlining touches were not retained, such as the streamlined casing around the smokebox stack as well as the teardrop shape of the classification lights. In addition, the inside of the cabs were no longer insulated in the same manner as the previous versions, which had provided better cold-weather cab insulation and were better-liked by crews. The last Selkirks were taken out of service in 1959. These were the most powerful steam locomotives in the British Empire. <ref name=Atkins/>\n\n===South Africa===\n[[File:Class 21 no. 2551 (2-10-4) a.jpg|thumb|left|[[South African Class 21 2-10-4|SAR Class 21]], c. 1937]]\nIn 1937, the South African Railways (SAR) placed one {{Track gauge|Cape|allk=on}} [[South African Class 21 2-10-4|Class 21]] steam locomotive with a Texas wheel arrangement in service, designed as a mixed traffic locomotive suitable for light rail. It was designed by A.G. Watson, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1929 to 1936, and built by the [[North British Locomotive Company]] in Glasgow. Only the one locomotive was built, at the time representing the maximum power obtainable on Cape gauge from a ten-coupled non-articulated locomotive that was limited to a {{convert|15|LT|t|1|abbr=off}} axle load on {{convert|60|lb/yd|kg/m|abbr=off}} rail.

A similar [[South African type JV tender|Type JV tender]] had been built in the Salt River shops in Cape Town in 1936 for test purposes and as a prototype to the Type FT.

One, the [[Soviet locomotive class OR23|class OR23]], built in 1949 by the locomotive works in [[Ulan Ude]], had cylinders that were placed above the center driving axle. Unlike nearly all steam locomotives, the pistons had rods on both ends which transferred power to the wheels. The idea was to balance the driving forces on the wheels, allowing the counterweights on the wheels to be smaller and reducing [[hammer blow]] on the track. Test runs showed, however, that the OR23 design was unsuitable as a practical locomotive. The locomotive was never used for more than testing and was returned to its builder  and scrapped.<ref name=Russia/>\n\n===United States of America===\n\n====Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe====\nThe [[Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway]] (ATSF) took delivery of locomotive no. 3829 from the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] in 1919. It was used by Santa Fe as an experimental locomotive and was rostered as a member of ATSF\u2019s 3800 class of 2-10-2s that was fitted with a four-wheel trailing truck. Nearly a hundred more 3800 class locomotives were delivered after no. 3829, but all with the 2-10-2 wheel arrangement. Photographs exist that show no. 3829 fitted with at least two different designs of four-wheel trailing truck through the years. No other members of the 3800 class have been documented with four-wheel trailing trucks. No. 3829 was scrapped in 1955, still equipped with a four-wheel trailing truck.<ref>{{cite book|last=Worley|first=E. D.|date=1965|title=Iron Horses of the Santa Fe Trail|publisher=Southwest Railroad Historical Society|page=340|lccn=75-39813}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ATSF 5000 Madam Queen.jpg|thumb|[[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|ATSF]] {{nowrap|2-10-4}} No. 5000 ''Madame Queen'']]Santa Fe, who had originated the {{nowrap|2-10-4}} type, adopted it again in 1930 with [[Santa Fe 5000|no. 5000]], nicknamed ''Madame Queen''. This locomotive was similar to the C&O T-1, with the same {{convert|69|inch|mm|0|abbr=off}} drivers but with {{convert|300|psi|abbr=off}} boiler pressure and 60% limited cutoff. It proved the viability of the type on the Santa Fe railway, but the [[Great Depression]] shelved plans to acquire more.\n\nIn 1938, with the railroad's fortunes improving, Santa Fe acquired ten more {{nowrap|2-10-4}} locomotives. These came with {{convert|74|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} diameter drivers and {{convert|310|psi|abbr=off}} boiler pressure, making these ATSF {{nowrap|2-10-4}}s the fastest and most modern of all.\n\nOf the original order of ten, five were oil-burning and five coal-burning, but when Santa Fe ordered twenty-five more for delivery in 1944, all were delivered equipped to burn oil. The first of the 1944 batch produced 5600 drawbar horsepower on road test, the highest figure known for a two-cylinder steam locomotive.\n\n====Texas and Pacific====\nThe {{nowrap|2-10-4}} type was revived in 1925 by the [[Lima Locomotive Works]]. This time it was an expansion of the [[2-8-4|{{nowrap|2-8-4}} Berkshire]] type that Lima had pioneered. A version of the Berkshire with ten driving wheels instead of eight was an obvious development and the first to be delivered were to the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]], after which the type was subsequently named. The four-wheel trailing truck allowed a much larger firebox and thus a greater ability to generate heat, and thus steam. The [[Superpower steam|''Superpower'']] design, as Lima's marketing department called it, resulted in a locomotive that could develop great power at speed while not running out of steam-generating ability.\n\n====Chesapeake & Ohio====\nThe early Lima-built Texas types were low-drivered, {{convert|60|to|64|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} in diameter, which did not leave enough space to fully counterweight the extremely heavy and sturdy [[side rod]]s and [[main rod]]s required for such a powerful locomotive's piston thrusts. That changed in 1930 on the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O), who stretched the design of an [[Erie Railroad]] high-drivered Berkshire type locomotive to produce forty of the {{nowrap|C&O T-1}}, a Texas type with {{convert|69|in|mm|0|abbr=off}} diameter drivers that was both powerful and fast enough for the new higher-speed freight services that the railroads were introducing. All subsequent Texas types were of this higher-drivered sort.\n\n====Pennsylvania====\nThe [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR) ordered few new locomotives after 1930, since [[electrification]] both consumed the railroad's resources and resulted in a supply of excess steam locomotives that eliminated any requirement for new power. It was not until the [[Second World War]] had begun, that the PRR's locomotive fleet began to appear inadequate. Although the PRR urgently needed new and modern freight power, the [[War Production Board]] prohibited working on a new design and, since there was not enough time to trial a prototype in any event, the PRR cast around for other railroads' designs that it might modify for PRR use.\n\nIt settled on the {{nowrap|C&O\u2019s T-1}}. Some modifications were made to the design for these PRR ''War Babies''. These included PRR drop-couplers, sheet steel [[pilot (locomotive)|pilots]], PRR-style [[Control car (rail)|cabs]], large PRR [[tender (locomotive)|tenders]], [[Keystone (steam automobile)|Keystone]] number plates up front and other modifications. It still betrayed its foreign heritage by lacking the PRR trademark [[Belpaire firebox]] and by having a [[booster engine]] on the trailing truck. Altogether 125 locomotives were built between 1942 and 1944 and became the largest fleet of Texas type locomotives in existence. All were eventually sold as scrap when the Pennsylvania Railroad dieselized.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carlson, Neil. |title=Toward the 2-10-4 |journal=Classic Trains Magazine (Fall 2010)|publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing|Kalmbach]] |year=2010 |volume=11 |issue=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Farrell, Jack W.|title=North American steam locomotives: The Berkshire and Texas types|year=1989|publisher=Pacific Fast Mail, Edmonds, WA|isbn=0-915713-15-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Westcott|first=Lynn.

Over several centuries of isolation, the Polynesian settlers formed a distinct culture that became known as the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]].\n\nEarly M\u0101ori history is often divided into two periods: the Archaic period ({{circa|1300|1500}}) and the Classic period ({{circa|1500|1642|lk=no}}). Archaeological sites such as [[Wairau Bar]] show evidence of early life in Polynesian settlements in New Zealand. Many of the crops that the settlers brought from Polynesia did not grow well at all in the colder New Zealand climate, although many native bird and marine species were hunted, sometimes to extinction. An increasing population, competition for resources and changes in local climate led to social and cultural changes seen in the Classic period of M\u0101ori history. This period saw the emergence of a warrior culture and fortified villages ({{Lang|mi|[[p\u0101]]}}), along with more elaborate [[M\u0101ori culture|cultural art forms]]. One group of M\u0101ori settled the [[Chatham Islands]] around 1500, forming a separate, pacifist culture known as the [[Moriori]].\n\nThe arrival of Europeans to New Zealand, starting in 1642 with [[Abel Tasman]], brought enormous changes to the M\u0101ori, who were introduced to Western food, technology, weapons and culture by European settlers, especially from Britain. In 1840 the British Crown and many M\u0101ori chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], allowing New Zealand to become part of the [[British Empire]] and granting M\u0101ori the status of British subjects. Initial relations between M\u0101ori and Europeans (whom the M\u0101ori called \"[[P\u0101keh\u0101]]\") were largely amicable. However, rising tensions over disputed land sales led to [[New Zealand Wars|conflict in the 1860s]] and large-scale [[New Zealand land confiscations|land confiscations]]. Social upheaval and epidemics of introduced disease also took a devastating toll on the M\u0101ori people, causing their population to decline and their standing in New Zealand to diminish.\n\nBut by the start of the 20th century, the M\u0101ori population had begun to recover, and efforts have been made to increase their social, political, cultural and economic standing in wider New Zealand society. A [[M\u0101ori protest movement|protest movement]] gained support in the 1960s seeking [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements|redress for historical grievances]]. In the 2013 census, there were approximately 600,000 people in New Zealand identifying as M\u0101ori, making up roughly 15 per cent of the national population.\n\n==Origins from Polynesia==\n[[File:Polynesian Migration.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|The M\u0101ori settlement of New Zealand represents an end-point of a long chain of [[island hopping|island-hopping]] voyages in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]]]\nEvidence from genetics, archaeology, linguistics, and physical anthropology indicates that the ancestry of Polynesian people stretches all the way back to [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|indigenous peoples of Taiwan]].

Over several centuries of isolation, the Polynesian settlers formed a distinct culture that became known as the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]].\n\nEarly M\u0101ori history is often divided into two periods: the Archaic period ({{circa|1300|1500}}) and the Classic period ({{circa|1500|1642|lk=no}}). Archaeological sites such as [[Wairau Bar]] show evidence of early life in Polynesian settlements in New Zealand. Many of the crops that the settlers brought from Polynesia did not grow well at all in the colder New Zealand climate, although many native bird and marine species were hunted, sometimes to extinction. An increasing population, competition for resources and changes in local climate led to social and cultural changes seen in the Classic period of M\u0101ori history. This period saw the emergence of a warrior culture and fortified villages ({{Lang|mi|[[p\u0101]]}}), along with more elaborate [[M\u0101ori culture|cultural art forms]]. One group of M\u0101ori settled the [[Chatham Islands]] around 1500, forming a separate, pacifist culture known as the [[Moriori]].\n\nThe arrival of Europeans to New Zealand, starting in 1642 with [[Abel Tasman]], brought enormous changes to the M\u0101ori, who were introduced to Western food, technology, weapons and culture by European settlers, especially from Britain. In 1840 the British Crown and many M\u0101ori chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], allowing New Zealand to become part of the [[British Empire]] and granting M\u0101ori the status of British subjects. Initial relations between M\u0101ori and Europeans (whom the M\u0101ori called \"[[P\u0101keh\u0101]]\") were largely amicable. However, rising tensions over disputed land sales led to [[New Zealand Wars|conflict in the 1860s]] and large-scale [[New Zealand land confiscations|land confiscations]]. Social upheaval and epidemics of introduced disease also took a devastating toll on the M\u0101ori people, causing their population to decline and their standing in New Zealand to diminish.\n\nBut by the start of the 20th century, the M\u0101ori population had begun to recover, and efforts have been made to increase their social, political, cultural and economic standing in wider New Zealand society. A [[M\u0101ori protest movement|protest movement]] gained support in the 1960s seeking [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements|redress for historical grievances]]. In the 2013 census, there were approximately 600,000 people in New Zealand identifying as M\u0101ori, making up roughly 15 per cent of the national population.\n\n==Origins from Polynesia==\n[[File:Polynesian Migration.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|The M\u0101ori settlement of New Zealand represents an end-point of a long chain of [[island hopping|island-hopping]] voyages in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]]]\nEvidence from genetics, archaeology, linguistics, and physical anthropology indicates that the ancestry of Polynesian people stretches all the way back to [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|indigenous peoples of Taiwan]].

Many M\u0101ori groups set up substantial businesses, supplying food and other products for domestic and overseas markets. Some of the early European settlers learned the M\u0101ori language and recorded [[M\u0101ori mythology]], including [[George Grey]], Governor of New Zealand from 1845\u20131855 and 1861\u20131868.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Calder |first1=Alex |title=George Grey's ''Polynesian mythology'' |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/interactive/43297/george-greys-polynesian-mythology |publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=20 August 2019 |date=22 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rewi Manga Maniapoto, by Gottfried Lindauer.jpg|thumb|upright|A portrait of M\u0101ori man, by [[Gottfried Lindauer]], 1882]]\n[[File:TawhiaoNLA.jpg|thumb|upright|[[T\u0101whiao]], the second M\u0101ori King]]\nHowever, rising tensions over disputed land purchases and attempts by M\u0101ori in the Waikato to establish what some saw as a rival to the British system of royalty \u2013 viz. the [[M\u0101ori King Movement]] ({{Lang|mi|K\u012bngitanga}}) \u2013 led to the [[New Zealand wars]] in the 1860s. These conflicts started when rebel M\u0101ori attacked isolated settlers in Taranaki but were fought mainly between Crown troops \u2013 from both Britain and new regiments raised in Australia, aided by settlers and some allied M\u0101ori (known as ''kupapa'') \u2013 and numerous M\u0101ori groups opposed to the disputed land sales, including some Waikato M\u0101ori.\n\nWhile these conflicts resulted in few M\u0101ori (compared to the earlier Musket wars) or European deaths, the colonial government [[New Zealand land confiscations|confiscated]] tracts of tribal land as punishment for what were called rebellions. In some cases the government confiscated land from tribes that had taken no part in the war, although this was almost immediately returned. Some of the confiscated land was returned to both kupapa and \"rebel\" M\u0101ori. Several minor conflicts also arose after the wars, including the incident at [[Parihaka]] in 1881 and the [[Dog Tax War]] from 1897\u201398.\n\nThe Native Land Acts of 1862 and 1865 established the [[Native Land Court]], which was intended to transfer M\u0101ori land from communal ownership into individual household title as a means to assimilation and to facilitate greater sales to European immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |title=M\u0101ori Land \u2013 What Is It and How Is It Administered? |url=https://www.oag.govt.nz/2004/maori-land-court/part2.htm |publisher=Office of the Auditor-General |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> M\u0101ori land under individual title became available to be sold to the colonial government or to settlers in private sales.

In total 4 per cent of this was confiscated land, although about a quarter of this was returned. 300,000 acres was returned to Kupapa M\u0101ori mainly in the lower Waikato River Basin area. Individual M\u0101ori titleholders received considerable capital from these land sales, with some lower Waikato Chiefs being given 1000 pounds each. Disputes later arose over whether or not promised compensation in some sales was fully delivered. Some claim that later, the selling off of M\u0101ori land and the lack of appropriate skills hampered M\u0101ori participation in developing the New Zealand economy, eventually diminishing the capacity of many M\u0101ori to sustain themselves.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe M\u0101ori MP [[Henare Kaihau]], from Waiuku, who was executive head of the King Movement, worked alongside King [[Mahuta T\u0101whiao|Mahuta]] to sell land to the government.

King Mahuta had been successful in getting restitution for some blocks of land previously confiscated, and these were returned to the King in his name.

Some M\u0101ori have complained that the settlements occur at a level of between 1 and 2.5 cents on the dollar of the value of the confiscated lands; conversely, some non-M\u0101ori denounce the settlements and socioeconomic iniatives as amounting to race-based preferential treatment. Both of these sentiments were expressed during the [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite report|title=Report on the Crown's Foreshore and Seabed Policy|url=https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/WT/reports/reportSummary.html?reportId=wt_DOC_68000605|publisher=[[Minister of Justice (New Zealand)|Ministry of Justice]]|accessdate=19 August 2019|language=en-NZ}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Barker|first1=Fiona|title=Debate about the foreshore and seabed|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/video/34605/debate-about-the-foreshore-and-seabed|encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=19 August 2019|date=June 2012}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|New Zealand|History}}\n* [[Pre-M\u0101ori settlement of New Zealand theories]]\n* [[M\u0101ori mythology]]\n* [[History of New Zealand]]\n* [[History of Oceania]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n* [https://www.govt.nz/browse/history-culture-and-heritage/nz-history/maori-history/ M\u0101ori history] \u2013 New Zealand Government\n\n{{M\u0101ori|state=expanded}}\n{{New Zealand topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maori History}}\n[[Category:M\u0101ori history| ]]\n[[Category:History of New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toShag River(link changed toShag River (Otago)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_history"}
