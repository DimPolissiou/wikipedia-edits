Gustavo Dudamel/Los Angeles Philharmonic, John Williams as guest conductor and Itzhak Perlman on violin (C Major Entertainment)\n\n==Discography as composer==\nJohn Williams himself recorded most of his compositions. However, there are some exceptions, and this section is therefore complementary to the main discography. In addition, it presents a special section dedicated to each of his concert works that have been recorded. As Williams' film works are loved by the public, they were much recorded and continue to be, so another section containing selections of some his works recorded by other artists is also featured.\n\n===Soundtracks conducted by others===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:left; width:40px;\"|Year\n!  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:left; width:350px;\"|Album\n!  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; width:70px;\"|Label\n!  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:left; width:130px;\"|Notes\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" \n|  style=\"text-align:left; \"|1959\n|  style=\"text-align:left; \"|''Wagon Train [Original TV Music From]''\n|  style=\"text-align:center; \"|Mercury Records\n|  style=\"text-align:center; \"|Some tracks composed by Johnny Williams.

He was an early advocate and developer of [[Georges Lema\u00eetre|Lema\u00eetre's]] [[Big Bang theory]]. He discovered a theoretical explanation of [[alpha decay]] by [[quantum tunneling]], invented the [[liquid drop model]] and the first mathematical model of the [[atomic nucleus]], and worked on [[radioactive decay]], [[stellar evolution|star formation]], [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] (which he collectively called [[nucleocosmogenesis]]), and [[molecular genetics]].\n\nIn his middle and late career, Gamow directed much of his attention to teaching and wrote popular books on science, including ''[[One Two Three... Infinity]]'' and the ''[[Mr Tompkins]]'' series of books (1939\u20131967). Some of his books are still in print more than a half-century after their original publication.\n\n==Early life and career==\nGamow was born in [[Odessa]], [[Russian Empire]]. His father taught Russian language and literature in high school, and his mother taught geography and history at a school for girls. In addition to Russian, Gamow learned to speak some French from his mother and German from a tutor. Gamow learned fluent English in his college years and later. Most of his early publications were in German or Russian, but he later switched to writing in English for both technical papers and for the lay audience.\n\nHe was educated at the [[Odessa University|Institute of Physics and Mathematics in Odessa]]<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the University of Odessa (in Ukrainian)|url=http://onu.edu.ua/uk/geninfo/history|website=History of the University of Odessa (in Ukrainian)|publisher=University of Odessa|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref> (1922\u201323) and at the [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of Leningrad]] (1923\u20131929). Gamow studied under [[Alexander Alexandrovich Friedman|Alexander Friedmann]] for some time in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], until Friedmann's early death in 1925. He aspired to do his doctoral thesis under Friedmann, but had to change dissertation advisors.  At the University, Gamow made friends with three other students of theoretical physics, [[Lev Landau]], [[Dmitri Ivanenko]], and [[Matvei Petrovich Bronstein|Matvey Bronshtein]]. The four formed a group known as the [[Three Musketeers]], which met to discuss and analyze the ground-breaking papers on quantum mechanics published during those years. He later used the same phrase to describe the Alpher, Herman, and Gamow group. \n\nOn graduation, he worked on [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], where his research into the atomic nucleus provided the basis for his doctorate. He then worked at the [[Niels Bohr Institute|Theoretical Physics Institute]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]] from 1928 to 1931, with a break to work with [[Ernest Rutherford]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in [[Cambridge]]. He continued to study the atomic nucleus (proposing the [[liquid drop model|\"liquid drop\" model]]), but also worked on stellar physics with [[Robert d'Escourt Atkinson|Robert Atkinson]] and [[Fritz Houtermans]]. \n\nIn 1931, Gamow was elected a corresponding member of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] at age 28 \u2013 one of the youngest in the history of this organization.<ref>[http://www.khlopin.ru/youth.php \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0412. \u0413. \u0425\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0451\u0436\u0438 (Radium Institute named after V.

At the same time, radiation emissions were known to have certain characteristic energies.

Also classically, it takes an enormous amount of energy to pull apart the nucleus, an event that would not occur spontaneously. In [[quantum mechanics]], however, there is a probability the particle can \"tunnel through\" the wall of the potential well and escape. Gamow solved a model potential for the nucleus and derived from first principles a relationship between the [[half-life]] of the alpha-decay event process and the energy of the emission, which had been previously discovered empirically and was known as the [[Geiger\u2013Nuttall law]].<ref>[http://www.phy.uct.ac.za/courses/phy300w/np/ch1/node38.html Gamow's derivation of this law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224200050/http://www.phy.uct.ac.za/courses/phy300w/np/ch1/node38.html |date=February 24, 2009 }}.</ref> Some years later, the name [[Gamow factor]] or Gamow\u2013Sommerfeld factor was applied to the probability of incoming nuclear particles tunnelling through the electrostatic [[Coulomb barrier]] and undergoing nuclear reactions.\n\n==Defection==\nGamow worked at a number of Soviet establishments before deciding to flee the Soviet Union because of increased oppression. In 1931, he was officially denied permission to attend a scientific conference in Italy. Also in 1931, he married Lyubov Vokhmintseva ({{lang-ru|\u041b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0412\u043e\u0445\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0430}}), another physicist in Soviet Union, whom he nicknamed \"Rho\" after [[rho|the Greek letter]]. Gamow and his new wife spent much of the next two years trying to leave the Soviet Union, with or without official permission. [[Niels Bohr]] and other friends invited Gamow to visit during this period, but Gamow could not get permission to leave.\n\nGamow later said that his first two attempts to defect with his wife were in 1932 and involved trying to [[kayak]]: first a planned 250-kilometer paddle over the [[Black Sea]] to [[Turkey]], and another attempt from [[Murmansk]] to [[Norway]]. Poor weather foiled both attempts, but they had not been noticed by the authorities.<ref>''My World Line'' G. Gamow, Viking Press, 1970, chap. 5 ''The Crimean campaign''.</ref>\n\nIn 1933, Gamow was suddenly granted permission to attend the 7th [[Solvay Conference]] on physics, in [[Brussels]]. He insisted on having his wife accompany him, even saying that he would not go alone. Eventually the Soviet authorities relented and issued passports for the couple. The two attended and arranged to extend their stay, with the help of [[Marie Curie]] and other physicists. Over the next year, Gamow obtained temporary work at the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Curie Institute]], [[University of London]], and the [[University of Michigan]].\n\n==Move to America==\nIn 1934, Gamow and his wife moved to the United States. He became a professor at [[George Washington University]] (GWU) in 1934 and recruited physicist [[Edward Teller]] from London to join him at GWU. In 1936, Gamow and Teller published what became known as the \"[[Gamow\u2013Teller transition|Gamow\u2013Teller selection rule]]\" for [[beta decay]]. During his time in Washington, Gamow would also publish major scientific papers with [[M\u00e1rio Schenberg]] and [[Ralph Alpher]]. By the late 1930s, Gamow's interests had turned towards [[astrophysics]] and [[cosmology]].\n\nIn 1935, Gamow's son, [[Igor Gamow]] was born (in a 1947 book, Gamow's dedication was \"To my son Igor, who wanted to be a cowboy\"). George Gamow became a [[naturalized citizen|naturalized American]] in 1940. He retained his formal association with GWU until 1956.\n\nDuring World War II, Gamow did not work directly on the [[Manhattan Project]] producing the [[atomic bomb]], in spite of his knowledge of [[radioactivity]] and [[nuclear fusion]]. He continued to teach physics at GWU and consulted for the US Navy.\n\nGamow was interested in the processes of [[stellar evolution]] and the early history of the [[Solar System]]. In 1945, he co-authored a paper supporting work by German theoretical physicist [[Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]] on planetary formation in the early Solar System.<ref name=Gamow>{{cite journal|last=Gamow|first=G.|author2=Hynek, J.

He was the earliest to employ [[Alexander Friedmann]]'s and [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]]'s non-static solutions of Einstein's gravitational equations describing a universe of uniform matter density and constant spatial curvature. Gamow's crucial advance would provide a physical reification of Lema\u00eetre's idea of a unique primordial quantum. Gamow did this by assuming that the early universe was dominated by radiation rather than by matter.<ref>Gamow, G. (1946, October 1 & 15), Physical Review.</ref> Most of the later work in cosmology is founded in Gamow's theory. He applied his model to the question of the creation of the chemical elements <ref>for example, Gamow, G. (1942), Jour. Washington Academy of Sciences, Vol. 32</ref> and to the subsequent condensation of matter into galaxies,<ref>Gamow, G. (1968) 'On the Origin of Galaxies', Properties of Matter under Unusual Conditions (Edward Teller 60th Birthday Volume). New York; John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Interscience Publishers.</ref> whose mass and diameter he was able to calculate in terms of the fundamental physical parameters, such as the speed of light ''c'', Newton's gravitational constant ''G'', Sommerfeld's fine-structure constant \u03b1, and Planck's constant ''h''.\n\nGamow's interest in cosmology arose from his earlier interest in energy generation and element production and transformation in stars.<ref>Gamow, G. (1935), Ohio Journal of Science, 35, 5.</ref><ref>Chandrasekhar, S., Gamow, G. and Tuve, M., (1938), Nature, May 28.</ref><ref>Gamow, G., Schoenberg, M., (1940), Physical Review, December 15.</ref> This work, in turn, evolved from his fundamental discovery of [[quantum tunneling]] as the mechanism  of nuclear [[alpha decay]], and his application of this theory to the inverse process to calculate rates of thermonuclear reaction.\n\nAt first, Gamow believed that all the elements might be produced in the very high temperature and density early stage of the universe. Later, he revised this opinion on the strength of compelling evidence advanced by [[Fred Hoyle]] and others, that elements heavier than lithium are largely produced in [[stellar nucleosynthesis|thermonuclear reactions in stars]] and in supernovae. Gamow formulated a set of coupled differential equations describing his proposed process and assigned, as a PhD dissertation topic, his graduate student [[Ralph Alpher]] the task of solving the equations numerically. These results of Gamow and Alpher appeared in 1948 as the [[Alpher\u2013Bethe\u2013Gamow paper]].<ref>Alpher, R. A., Bethe, H., Gamow, G., (1948), Phys. Rev., April 1. The inclusion of Bethe's name is explained at [[\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 paper]].</ref> Before his interest turned to the question of the genetic code, Gamow published about twenty papers on cosmology. The earliest was in 1939 with Edward Teller on galaxy formation,<ref>Gamow, G., Teller, E., (1939), Nature, January 21 and March 4.</ref> followed in 1946 by the first description of cosmic nucleosynthesis. He also wrote many popular articles as well as academic textbooks on this and other subjects.<ref>Gamow and Critchfield (1949), \"Theory of Atomic Nucleus and Energy Sources\", Clarendon Press, Oxford</ref>\n\nIn 1948, he published a paper dealing with an attenuated version of the coupled set of equations describing the production of the proton and the deuteron from thermal neutrons. By means of a simplification and using the observed ratio of hydrogen to heavier elements, he was able to obtain the density of matter at the onset of nucleosynthesis and from this the mass and diameter of the early galaxies.<ref>Gamow, G., (1948), Nature, 162, October 30.</ref> In 1953 he produced similar results, but this time based on another determination of the density of matter and radiation, at the time at which they became equal.<ref>Gamow, G., (1953), Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab, 39</ref> In this paper, Gamow determined the density of the relict background radiation, from which a present temperature of 7\u00b0K was predicted \u2013 a value which was slightly more than twice the presently-accepted value. \n\nIn 1967, he published reminiscences and recapitulation of his own work as well as the work of Alpher and Robert Herman (both with Gamow and also independently of him).<ref>Alpher, R. A., Gamow G., Herman R., (1967), Proc. Natl. Acad Sci., 57.</ref> This was prompted by the discovery of the [[cosmic background radiation]] by Penzias and Wilson in 1965; Gamow, Alpher, and Herman felt that they did not receive the credit they deserved for their theoretical predictions of its existence and source. Gamow was disconcerted by the fact that the authors of a communication<ref>Dicke, R. H., Peebles, P. J. E., Roll, P. G., and Wilkinson, T. D. (1965), ''Astrophysical Journal'', 142, 414</ref> explaining the significance of the Penzias/Wilson observations failed to recognize and cite the previous work of Gamow and his collaborators.\n\n==DNA and RNA==\nIn 1953, [[Francis Crick]], [[James Watson]], [[Maurice Wilkins]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]] discovered the [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]] structure of the [[DNA]] macromolecule. Gamow attempted to solve the problem of how the ordering of four different bases ([[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[thymine]] and [[guanine]]) in DNA chains might control the synthesis of proteins from their constituent amino acids.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Segr\u00e8|first=Gino|title=The Big Bang and the genetic code|journal=Nature|volume=404|issue=6777|page=437|date=2000-03-30|url=http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=nature/journal/v404/n6777/full/404437a0_r.html|doi=10.1038/35006517|pmid=10761891}}</ref> Crick has said that Gamow's suggestions helped him in his own thinking about the problem.<ref>{{cite web|title=DNA: An \"Amateur\" Makes a Real Contribution|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trr115.html|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref> As related by Crick,<ref>Crick, Francis \"What Mad Pursuit\" (Basic Books 1998), Chap.8 The Genetic Code</ref> Gamow observed that the 4<sup>3</sup> = 64 possible [[permutation]]s of the four DNA bases, taken three at a time, would be reduced to 20 distinct [[combination]]s if the order was irrelevant.<ref> The twenty distinct combinations are:(3A)(3C)(3G)(3T),(ACG)(ACT)(AGT)(CGT),(2A,C)(2A,G)(2A,T)(2C,A)(2C,G)(2C,T)(2G,A)(2G,C)(2G,T)(2T,A)(2T,C)(2T,G).</ref>. Gamow proposed that these 20 combinations might code for the twenty amino acids which, he suggested, might well be the sole constituents of all proteins. Gamow's contribution to solving the problem of genetic coding gave rise to important models of [[Degeneracy (biology)|biological degeneracy]].<ref>Mason, P. H. (2010) Degeneracy at multiple levels of complexity, Biological Theory: Integrating Development, Evolution and Cognition, 5(3), 277-288.</ref><ref>Mason, P. H. (2014) Degeneracy: Demystifying and destigmatizing a core concept in systems biology. Complexity. {{doi|10.1002/cplx.21534}}</ref>\n\nThe specific system that Gamow was proposing (called \"Gamow's diamonds\") proved to be incorrect. The triplets were supposed to be overlapping, so that in the sequence GGAC (for example), GGA could produce one amino acid and GAC another, and also [[Degeneracy of the genetic code|non-degenerate]] (meaning that each amino acid would correspond to one combination of three bases \u2013 in any order). Later protein sequencing work proved that this could not be the case; the true [[genetic code]] is non-overlapping and degenerate, and changing the order of a combination of bases does change the amino acid.\n\nIn 1954, Gamow and Watson co-founded the [[RNA Tie Club]]. This was a discussion group of leading scientists concerned with the problem of the genetic code, which counted among its members the physicists [[Edward Teller]] and [[Richard Feynman]]. In his autobiographical writings, Watson later acknowledged the great importance of Gamow's insightful initiative. However, this did not prevent him from describing this colorful personality as a \"zany\", card-trick playing, limerick-singing, booze-swilling, practical\u2013joking \"giant imp\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=J.

In 1956, he moved to the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], where he remained for the rest of his career. In 1956, Gamow became one of the founding members of the [[Physical Science Study Committee]] (PSSC), which later reformed teaching of high-school physics in the post-[[Sputnik]] years. Also in 1956, he divorced his first wife. Gamow later married [[Barbara Perkins Gamow|Barbara Perkins]] (an editor for one of his publishers) in 1958.\n\nIn 1959, Gamow, [[Hans Bethe]], and [[Victor Weisskopf]] publicly supported the re-entry of [[Frank Oppenheimer]] into teaching college physics at the [[University of Colorado]], as the [[Red Scare]] began to fade ([[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] was the older brother of Frank Oppenheimer, and both of them had worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] before their careers in physics were derailed by [[McCarthyism]]).<ref name=\"Cole\">{{Cite book| last = Cole| first = K.C.| date = 2009| title = Something Incredibly Wonderful Happens: Frank Oppenheimer and the World He Made Up| publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt| isbn = 978-0-15-100822-3| url = https://archive.org/details/somethingincredi00cole}}</ref>{{rp|130}} While in Colorado, Frank Oppenheimer became increasingly interested in teaching science through simple hands-on experiments, and he eventually moved to [[San Francisco]] to found the [[Exploratorium]].<ref name=\"Cole\" />{{rp|130\u2013152}}  Gamow would not live to see his colleague's opening of this innovative new science museum, in late August 1969.<ref name=\"Cole\" />{{rp|152}}\n\nIn his 1961 book ''The Atom and its Nucleus'', Gamow proposed representing the [[periodic system]] of the [[chemical elements]] as a continuous tape, with the elements in order of [[atomic number]] wound round in a three-dimensional helix whose diameter increased stepwise (corresponding to the longer rows of the conventional periodic table).\n\nGamow continued his teaching at the University of Colorado Boulder and focused increasingly on writing textbooks and books on science for the general public. After several months of ill health, surgeries on his circulatory system, diabetes and liver problems, Gamow was dying from [[liver failure]], which he had called the \"weak link\" that could not withstand the other stresses.\n\nIn a letter written to Ralph Alpher on August 18, he had written, \"The pain in the abdomen is unbearable and does not stop\". Prior to this, there had been a long exchange of letters with his former student, in which he was seeking a fresh understanding of some concepts used in his earlier work, with Paul Dirac.  Gamow relied on Alpher for deeper understanding of mathematics.\n\nOn August 19, 1968, Gamow died at age 64 in [[Boulder, Colorado]], and was buried there in Green Mountain Cemetery. The physics department tower at the University of Colorado at Boulder is named after him.\n\n== Personal life ==\nGamow had a son, [[Igor Gamow]], with his first wife Rho.

As an educator, Gamow recognized and emphasized fundamental principles that were unlikely to become obsolete, even as the pace of science and technology accelerated. He also conveyed a sense of excitement with the revolution in physics and other scientific topics of interest to the common reader. Gamow himself sketched the many illustrations for his books, which added a new dimension to and complemented what he intended to convey in the text. He was unafraid to introduce mathematics wherever it was essential, but he tried to avoid deterring potential readers by including large numbers of equations that did not illustrate essential points.\n\nIn 1956, he was awarded the [[Kalinga Prize]] by [[UNESCO]] for his work in popularizing science with his ''[[Mr Tompkins|Mr. Tompkins...]]'' series of books (1939\u20131967), his book ''[[One Two Three ... Infinity|One, Two, Three...Infinity]]'', and other works.\n\nBefore his death, Gamow was working with Richard Blade on a textbook ''Basic Theories in Modern Physics'', but the work was never completed or published under that title.  Gamow was also writing ''My World Line: An Informal Autobiography'', which was published posthumously in 1970.\n\nA collection of Gamow's writings was donated to The [[George Washington University]] in 1996.

He was an early advocate and developer of [[Georges Lema\u00eetre|Lema\u00eetre's]] [[Big Bang theory]]. He discovered a theoretical explanation of [[alpha decay]] via [[quantum tunneling]], invented the [[liquid drop model]] and the first mathematical model of the [[atomic nucleus]], and worked on [[radioactive decay]], [[stellar evolution|star formation]], [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] (which he collectively called [[nucleocosmogenesis]]), and [[molecular genetics]].\n\nIn his middle and late career, Gamow directed much of his attention to teaching and wrote popular books on science, including ''[[One Two Three... Infinity]]'' and the ''[[Mr Tompkins]]'' series of books (1939\u20131967). Some of his books are still in print more than a half-century after their original publication.\n\n==Early life and career==\nGamow was born in [[Odessa]], [[Russian Empire]]. His father taught Russian language and literature in high school, and his mother taught geography and history at a school for girls. In addition to Russian, Gamow learned to speak some French from his mother and German from a tutor. Gamow learned fluent English in his college years and later. Most of his early publications were in German or Russian, but he later switched to writing in English for both technical papers and for the lay audience.\n\nHe was educated at the [[Odessa University|Institute of Physics and Mathematics in Odessa]]<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the University of Odessa (in Ukrainian)|url=http://onu.edu.ua/uk/geninfo/history|website=History of the University of Odessa (in Ukrainian)|publisher=University of Odessa|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref> (1922\u201323) and at the [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of Leningrad]] (1923\u20131929). Gamow studied under [[Alexander Alexandrovich Friedman|Alexander Friedmann]] for some time in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], until Friedmann's early death in 1925. He aspired to do his doctoral thesis under Friedmann, but had to change dissertation advisors.  At the University, Gamow made friends with three other students of theoretical physics, [[Lev Landau]], [[Dmitri Ivanenko]], and [[Matvei Petrovich Bronstein|Matvey Bronshtein]]. The four formed a group known as the [[Three Musketeers]], which met to discuss and analyze the ground-breaking papers on quantum mechanics published during those years. He later used the same phrase to describe the Alpher, Herman, and Gamow group. \n\nOn graduation, he worked on [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], where his research into the atomic nucleus provided the basis for his doctorate. He then worked at the [[Niels Bohr Institute|Theoretical Physics Institute]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]] from 1928 to 1931, with a break to work with [[Ernest Rutherford]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in [[Cambridge]]. He continued to study the atomic nucleus (proposing the [[liquid drop model|\"liquid drop\" model]]), but also worked on stellar physics with [[Robert d'Escourt Atkinson|Robert Atkinson]] and [[Fritz Houtermans]]. \n\nIn 1931, Gamow was elected a corresponding member of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] at age 28 \u2013 one of the youngest in the history of this organization.<ref>[http://www.khlopin.ru/youth.php \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0412. \u0413. \u0425\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0451\u0436\u0438 (Radium Institute named after V.

At the same time, radiation emissions were known to have certain characteristic energies. By 1928, Gamow in G\u00f6ttingen had solved the theory of the [[alpha decay]] of a nucleus via [[Quantum tunnelling|tunnelling]], with mathematical help from [[Nikolai Kochin]].<ref>[http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/4325.html Interview with George Gamow by Charles Weiner at Gamow's home in Boulder, Colorado, April 25, 1968.

Also classically, it takes an enormous amount of energy to pull apart the nucleus, an event that would not occur spontaneously. In [[quantum mechanics]], however, there is a probability the particle can \"tunnel through\" the wall of the potential well and escape. Gamow solved a model potential for the nucleus and derived from first principles a relationship between the [[half-life]] of the alpha-decay event process and the energy of the emission, which had been previously discovered empirically and was known as the [[Geiger\u2013Nuttall law]].<ref>[http://www.phy.uct.ac.za/courses/phy300w/np/ch1/node38.html Gamow's derivation of this law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224200050/http://www.phy.uct.ac.za/courses/phy300w/np/ch1/node38.html |date=February 24, 2009 }}.</ref> Some years later, the name [[Gamow factor]] or Gamow\u2013Sommerfeld factor was applied to the probability of incoming nuclear particles tunnelling through the electrostatic [[Coulomb barrier]] and undergoing nuclear reactions.\n\n==Defection==\nGamow worked at a number of Soviet establishments before deciding to flee the Soviet Union because of increased oppression. In 1931, he was officially denied permission to attend a scientific conference in Italy. Also in 1931, he married Lyubov Vokhmintseva ({{lang-ru|\u041b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0412\u043e\u0445\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0430}}), another physicist in Soviet Union, whom he nicknamed \"Rho\" after [[rho|the Greek letter]]. Gamow and his new wife spent much of the next two years trying to leave the Soviet Union, with or without official permission. [[Niels Bohr]] and other friends invited Gamow to visit during this period, but Gamow could not get permission to leave.\n\nGamow later said that his first two attempts to defect with his wife were in 1932 and involved trying to [[kayak]]: first a planned 250-kilometer paddle over the [[Black Sea]] to [[Turkey]], and another attempt from [[Murmansk]] to [[Norway]]. Poor weather foiled both attempts, but they had not been noticed by the authorities.<ref>''My World Line'' G. Gamow, Viking Press, 1970, chap. 5 ''The Crimean campaign''.</ref>\n\nIn 1933, Gamow was suddenly granted permission to attend the 7th [[Solvay Conference]] on physics, in [[Brussels]]. He insisted on having his wife accompany him, even saying that he would not go alone. Eventually the Soviet authorities relented and issued passports for the couple. The two attended and arranged to extend their stay, with the help of [[Marie Curie]] and other physicists. Over the next year, Gamow obtained temporary work at the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Curie Institute]], [[University of London]], and the [[University of Michigan]].\n\n==Move to America==\nIn 1934, Gamow and his wife moved to the United States. He became a professor at [[George Washington University]] (GWU) in 1934 and recruited physicist [[Edward Teller]] from London to join him at GWU. In 1936, Gamow and Teller published what became known as the \"[[Gamow\u2013Teller transition|Gamow\u2013Teller selection rule]]\" for [[beta decay]]. During his time in Washington, Gamow would also publish major scientific papers with [[M\u00e1rio Schenberg]] and [[Ralph Alpher]]. By the late 1930s, Gamow's interests had turned towards [[astrophysics]] and [[cosmology]].\n\nIn 1935, Gamow's son, [[Igor Gamow]] was born (in a 1947 book, Gamow's dedication was \"To my son Igor, who wanted to be a cowboy\"). George Gamow became a [[naturalized citizen|naturalized American]] in 1940. He retained his formal association with GWU until 1956.\n\nDuring World War II, Gamow did not work directly on the [[Manhattan Project]] producing the [[atomic bomb]], in spite of his knowledge of [[radioactivity]] and [[nuclear fusion]]. He continued to teach physics at GWU and consulted for the US Navy.\n\nGamow was interested in the processes of [[stellar evolution]] and the early history of the [[Solar System]]. In 1945, he co-authored a paper supporting work by German theoretical physicist [[Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]] on planetary formation in the early Solar System.<ref name=Gamow>{{cite journal|last=Gamow|first=G.|author2=Hynek, J.

He was the earliest to employ [[Alexander Friedmann]]'s and [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]]'s non-static solutions of Einstein's gravitational equations describing a universe of uniform matter density and constant spatial curvature. Gamow's crucial advance would provide a physical reification of Lema\u00eetre's idea of a unique primordial quantum. Gamow did this by assuming that the early universe was dominated by radiation rather than by matter.<ref>Gamow, G. (1946, October 1 & 15), Physical Review.</ref> Most of the later work in cosmology is founded in Gamow's theory. He applied his model to the question of the creation of the chemical elements <ref>for example, Gamow, G. (1942), Jour. Washington Academy of Sciences, Vol. 32</ref> and to the subsequent condensation of matter into galaxies,<ref>Gamow, G. (1968) 'On the Origin of Galaxies', Properties of Matter under Unusual Conditions (Edward Teller 60th Birthday Volume). New York; John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Interscience Publishers.</ref> whose mass and diameter he was able to calculate in terms of the fundamental physical parameters, such as the speed of light ''c'', Newton's gravitational constant ''G'', Sommerfeld's fine-structure constant \u03b1, and Planck's constant ''h''.\n\nGamow's interest in cosmology arose from his earlier interest in energy generation and element production and transformation in stars.<ref>Gamow, G. (1935), Ohio Journal of Science, 35, 5.</ref><ref>Chandrasekhar, S., Gamow, G. and Tuve, M., (1938), Nature, May 28.</ref><ref>Gamow, G., Schoenberg, M., (1940), Physical Review, December 15.</ref> This work, in turn, evolved from his fundamental discovery of [[quantum tunneling]] as the mechanism  of nuclear [[alpha decay]], and his application of this theory to the inverse process to calculate rates of thermonuclear reaction.\n\nAt first, Gamow believed that all the elements might be produced in the very high temperature and density early stage of the universe. Later, he revised this opinion on the strength of compelling evidence advanced by [[Fred Hoyle]] and others, that elements heavier than lithium are largely produced in [[stellar nucleosynthesis|thermonuclear reactions in stars]] and in supernovae. Gamow formulated a set of coupled differential equations describing his proposed process and assigned, as a PhD dissertation topic, his graduate student [[Ralph Alpher]] the task of solving the equations numerically. These results of Gamow and Alpher appeared in 1948 as the [[Alpher\u2013Bethe\u2013Gamow paper]].<ref>Alpher, R. A., Bethe, H., Gamow, G., (1948), Phys. Rev., April 1. The inclusion of Bethe's name is explained at [[\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 paper]].</ref> Before his interest turned to the question of the genetic code, Gamow published about twenty papers on cosmology. The earliest was in 1939 with Edward Teller on galaxy formation,<ref>Gamow, G., Teller, E., (1939), Nature, January 21 and March 4.</ref> followed in 1946 by the first description of cosmic nucleosynthesis. He also wrote many popular articles as well as academic textbooks on this and other subjects.<ref>Gamow and Critchfield (1949), \"Theory of Atomic Nucleus and Energy Sources\", Clarendon Press, Oxford</ref>\n\nIn 1948, he published a paper dealing with an attenuated version of the coupled set of equations describing the production of the proton and the deuteron from thermal neutrons. By means of a simplification and using the observed ratio of hydrogen to heavier elements, he was able to obtain the density of matter at the onset of nucleosynthesis and from this the mass and diameter of the early galaxies.<ref>Gamow, G., (1948), Nature, 162, October 30.</ref> In 1953 he produced similar results, but this time based on another determination of the density of matter and radiation, at the time at which they became equal.<ref>Gamow, G., (1953), Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab, 39</ref> In this paper, Gamow determined the density of the relict background radiation, from which a present temperature of 7\u00b0K was predicted \u2013 a value which was slightly more than twice the presently-accepted value. \n\nIn 1967, he published reminiscences and recapitulation of his own work as well as the work of Alpher and Robert Herman (both with Gamow and also independently of him).<ref>Alpher, R. A., Gamow G., Herman R., (1967), Proc. Natl. Acad Sci., 57.</ref> This was prompted by the discovery of the [[cosmic background radiation]] by Penzias and Wilson in 1965; Gamow, Alpher, and Herman felt that they did not receive the credit they deserved for their theoretical predictions of its existence and source. Gamow was disconcerted by the fact that the authors of a communication<ref>Dicke, R. H., Peebles, P. J. E., Roll, P. G., and Wilkinson, T. D. (1965), ''Astrophysical Journal'', 142, 414</ref> explaining the significance of the Penzias/Wilson observations failed to recognize and cite the previous work of Gamow and his collaborators.\n\n==DNA and RNA==\nIn 1953, [[Francis Crick]], [[James Watson]], [[Maurice Wilkins]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]] discovered the [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]] structure of the [[DNA]] macromolecule. Gamow attempted to solve the problem of how the ordering of four different bases ([[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[thymine]] and [[guanine]]) in DNA chains might control the synthesis of proteins from their constituent amino acids.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Segr\u00e8|first=Gino|title=The Big Bang and the genetic code|journal=Nature|volume=404|issue=6777|page=437|date=2000-03-30|url=http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=nature/journal/v404/n6777/full/404437a0_r.html|doi=10.1038/35006517|pmid=10761891}}</ref> Crick has said that Gamow's suggestions helped him in his own thinking about the problem.<ref>{{cite web|title=DNA: An \"Amateur\" Makes a Real Contribution|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trr115.html|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref> As related by Crick,<ref>Crick, Francis \"What Mad Pursuit\" (Basic Books 1998), Chap.8 The Genetic Code</ref> Gamow observed that the 4<sup>3</sup> = 64 possible [[permutation]]s of the four DNA bases, taken three at a time, would be reduced to 20 distinct [[combination]]s if the order was irrelevant.<ref> The twenty distinct combinations are:(3A)(3C)(3G)(3T),(ACG)(ACT)(AGT)(CGT),(2A,C)(2A,G)(2A,T)(2C,A)(2C,G)(2C,T)(2G,A)(2G,C)(2G,T)(2T,A)(2T,C)(2T,G).</ref>. Gamow proposed that these 20 combinations might code for the twenty amino acids which, he suggested, might well be the sole constituents of all proteins. Gamow's contribution to solving the problem of genetic coding gave rise to important models of [[Degeneracy (biology)|biological degeneracy]].<ref>Mason, P. H. (2010) Degeneracy at multiple levels of complexity, Biological Theory: Integrating Development, Evolution and Cognition, 5(3), 277-288.</ref><ref>Mason, P. H. (2014) Degeneracy: Demystifying and destigmatizing a core concept in systems biology. Complexity. {{doi|10.1002/cplx.21534}}</ref>\n\nThe specific system that Gamow was proposing (called \"Gamow's diamonds\") proved to be incorrect. The triplets were supposed to be overlapping, so that in the sequence GGAC (for example), GGA could produce one amino acid and GAC another, and also [[Degeneracy of the genetic code|non-degenerate]] (meaning that each amino acid would correspond to one combination of three bases \u2013 in any order). Later protein sequencing work proved that this could not be the case; the true [[genetic code]] is non-overlapping and degenerate, and changing the order of a combination of bases does change the amino acid.\n\nIn 1954, Gamow and Watson co-founded the [[RNA Tie Club]]. This was a discussion group of leading scientists concerned with the problem of the genetic code, which counted among its members the physicists [[Edward Teller]] and [[Richard Feynman]]. In his autobiographical writings, Watson later acknowledged the great importance of Gamow's insightful initiative. However, this did not prevent him from describing this colorful personality as a \"zany\", card-trick playing, limerick-singing, booze-swilling, practical\u2013joking \"giant imp\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=J.

In 1956, he moved to the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], where he remained for the rest of his career. In 1956, Gamow became one of the founding members of the [[Physical Science Study Committee]] (PSSC), which later reformed teaching of high-school physics in the post-[[Sputnik]] years. Also in 1956, he divorced his first wife. Gamow later married [[Barbara Perkins Gamow|Barbara Perkins]] (an editor for one of his publishers) in 1958.\n\nIn 1959, Gamow, [[Hans Bethe]], and [[Victor Weisskopf]] publicly supported the re-entry of [[Frank Oppenheimer]] into teaching college physics at the [[University of Colorado]], as the [[Red Scare]] began to fade ([[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] was the older brother of Frank Oppenheimer, and both of them had worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] before their careers in physics were derailed by [[McCarthyism]]).<ref name=\"Cole\">{{Cite book| last = Cole| first = K.C.| date = 2009| title = Something Incredibly Wonderful Happens: Frank Oppenheimer and the World He Made Up| publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt| isbn = 978-0-15-100822-3| url = https://archive.org/details/somethingincredi00cole}}</ref>{{rp|130}} While in Colorado, Frank Oppenheimer became increasingly interested in teaching science through simple hands-on experiments, and he eventually moved to [[San Francisco]] to found the [[Exploratorium]].<ref name=\"Cole\" />{{rp|130\u2013152}}  Gamow would not live to see his colleague's opening of this innovative new science museum, in late August 1969.<ref name=\"Cole\" />{{rp|152}}\n\nIn his 1961 book ''The Atom and its Nucleus'', Gamow proposed representing the [[periodic system]] of the [[chemical elements]] as a continuous tape, with the elements in order of [[atomic number]] wound round in a three-dimensional helix whose diameter increased stepwise (corresponding to the longer rows of the conventional periodic table).\n\nGamow continued his teaching at the University of Colorado Boulder and focused increasingly on writing textbooks and books on science for the general public. After several months of ill health, surgeries on his circulatory system, diabetes and liver problems, Gamow was dying from [[liver failure]], which he had called the \"weak link\" that could not withstand the other stresses.\n\nIn a letter written to Ralph Alpher on August 18, he had written, \"The pain in the abdomen is unbearable and does not stop\". Prior to this, there had been a long exchange of letters with his former student, in which he was seeking a fresh understanding of some concepts used in his earlier work, with Paul Dirac.  Gamow relied on Alpher for deeper understanding of mathematics.\n\nOn August 19, 1968, Gamow died at age 64 in [[Boulder, Colorado]], and was buried there in Green Mountain Cemetery. The physics department tower at the University of Colorado at Boulder is named after him.\n\n== Personal life ==\nGamow had a son, [[Igor Gamow]], with his first wife Rho. The son later became a professor of [[microbiology]] at the [[University of Colorado]], as well as an inventor.\n\nGamow was a well-known prankster, who delighted in practical jokes and humorous twists embedded in serious scientific publications.<ref name=\"Antunes\">{{cite web |last1=Antunes |first1=Alex \"Sandy\" |title=8 Great Scientist Pranksters |url=https://www.science20.com/daytime_astronomer/8_great_scientist_pranksters-77733 |website=Science 2.0 |accessdate=2020-04-04 |language=en |date=27 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Segre\">{{cite web |last1=Segr\u00e8 |first1=Gino |title=The Big Bang and the genetic code |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/35006517 |website=Nature |accessdate=2020-04-04 |pages=437\u2013437 |language=en |doi=10.1038/35006517 |date=March 2000}}</ref> His most famous prank was the pioneering [[Alpher\u2013Bethe\u2013Gamow paper]], which was serious in its style and content.

As an educator, Gamow recognized and emphasized fundamental principles that were unlikely to become obsolete, even as the pace of science and technology accelerated. He also conveyed a sense of excitement with the revolution in physics and other scientific topics of interest to the common reader. Gamow himself sketched the many illustrations for his books, which added a new dimension to and complemented what he intended to convey in the text. He was unafraid to introduce mathematics wherever it was essential, but he tried to avoid deterring potential readers by including large numbers of equations that did not illustrate essential points.\n\nIn 1956, he was awarded the [[Kalinga Prize]] by [[UNESCO]] for his work in popularizing science with his ''[[Mr Tompkins|Mr. Tompkins...]]'' series of books (1939\u20131967), his book ''[[One Two Three ... Infinity|One, Two, Three...Infinity]]'', and other works.\n\nBefore his death, Gamow was working with Richard Blade on a textbook ''Basic Theories in Modern Physics'', but the work was never completed or published under that title.  Gamow was also writing ''My World Line: An Informal Autobiography'', which was published posthumously in 1970.\n\nA collection of Gamow's writings was donated to The [[George Washington University]] in 1996.  The materials include correspondence, articles, manuscripts and printed materials both by and about George Gamow.  The collection is currently under the care of GWU's Special Collections Research Center, located in the Estelle and Melvin [[Gelman Library]].<ref name=\"Preliminary Guide to the George Gamow Papers, 1934-1955\">[http://library.gwu.edu/ead/ms0252.xml Preliminary Guide to the George Gamow Papers, 1934\u20131955], Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University.</ref>\n\n==Books==\n\n===Popular===\n* ''[[The Birth and Death of the Sun]]'' (1940, revised 1952)\n* ''The Biography of the Earth'' (1941)\n* ''[[One Two Three ...

Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to [[Washington, D.C.]]; however, once they have arrived, they drug Northup and deliver him to a [[Slavery in the United States|slave pen]] run by a man named Burch. Northup proclaims that he is a free man, only to be savagely beaten with a wooden paddle and then a leather strap.\n\nNorthup is shipped to [[New Orleans]] along with other captive African-Americans. He is told by the others that if he wants to survive in the [[Southern United States|South]], he must adapt to being a slave and not tell anyone he is a free man. A slave trader named Theophilus Freeman gives Northup the identity of \"Platt\", a runaway slave from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and sells him to plantation owner [[William Prince Ford|William Ford]]. Ford takes a liking to Northup and gives him a violin. A growing tension between Northup and plantation carpenter John Tibeats finally breaks as Tibeats tries to beat Northup. Northup snaps and beats Tibeats with his hands before beating him with his own whip. Tibeats and his group try to hang Northup, but they are not successful. Northup is left on tiptoes with the noose around his neck for hours before Ford arrives and cuts Northup down. To save Northup's life, Ford sells him to another slave owner named Edwin Epps. In the process, Northup attempts to explain that he is actually a free man, but Ford tells him he is too afraid and that he cannot help him.\n\nEpps, unlike Ford, is ruthless and sadistic. Northup meets Patsey, a favored slave who can pick over 500 pounds of cotton a day, twice the usual quota. Epps regularly [[rape]]s Patsey while his wife abuses and humiliates her out of jealousy. Some time later, [[cotton worm]]s destroy Epps's crops. Unable to work his fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains the favor of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he uses the money to pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail a letter to his friends in New York. Armsby agrees and accepts Northup's saved money, but immediately betrays him to Epps. In the middle of the night, a drunken Epps wakes Northup and questions him menacingly about the letter while holding a knife to Northup's stomach. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and Epps relents. Afterwards, Northup mournfully burns the letter to prevent Epps from finding it. Some time later, Patsey is caught by Epps going to a neighboring plantation in order to acquire soap, as Mrs. Epps won't let her have any. In retaliation, Epps orders Northup to whip Patsey. Patsey is then whipped brutally by Epps, to the point of near death. After the incident, Northup destroys his violin in a rage.\n\nNorthup begins working on the construction of a [[gazebo]] with a [[Canadians|Canadian]] laborer named Samuel Bass. Bass is unsettled by the brutal way that Epps treats his slaves and expresses his opposition to slavery, earning Epps's enmity. Northup overhears the conversation and decides to reveal his kidnapping to Bass. Once again, Northup asks for help in getting a letter to New York. Although Bass is hesitant at first because of the risks, he agrees to send it. One day, the local sheriff arrives in a carriage with two men. The sheriff asks Northup a series of questions to confirm that his answers match the facts of his life in New York. Northup recognizes the sheriff's companion as Mr. Parker, a shopkeeper he knew in Saratoga Springs. Parker has come to free him, and the two embrace, though an enraged Epps furiously protests the circumstances and tries to prevent Northup from leaving. Northup gives an emotional farewell to Patsey and rides off to his freedom.\n\nNorthup is returned to his home and family, crying as he walks up the steps. As he walks in, he sees his wife with their fully grown son and daughter, and her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. Northup apologizes for his long absence while his family comforts him. The film's [[epilogue]] titles recount: Northup's unsuccessful suits against Brown, Hamilton, and Burch; the 1853 publication of Northup's [[slave narrative]] memoir, ''[[Twelve Years a Slave]]''; describes his role in the [[abolitionist movement]]; and the absence of any information surrounding the details of his death and burial.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Alfre Woodard 12 Years a Slave 60.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alfre Woodard]] at the premiere of ''12 Years a Slave'']]\n<!-- Cast as Billed in film per [[WP:CASTLIST]] -->\n<!-- Do not any more names unless they are notable (and include citations)-->\n{{Div col}}\n<!-- Billed one actor per screen -->\n*[[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as [[Solomon Northup]] / Platt\n*[[Michael Fassbender]] as Edwin Epps\n*[[Lupita Nyong'o]] as [[Patsey]]\n*[[Sarah Paulson]] as Mary Epps\n*[[Paul Dano]] as John Tibeats\n*[[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[William Prince Ford|William Ford]]\n*[[Alfre Woodard]] as Mistress Harriet Shaw\n*[[Brad Pitt]] as Samuel Bass\n*[[Adepero Oduye]] as Eliza\n*[[Garret Dillahunt]] as Armsby\n*[[Scoot McNairy]] as Merrill Brown\n*[[Taran Killam]] as Abram Hamilton\n*Christopher Berry as James H.

Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to [[Washington, D.C.]]; however, once they have arrived, they drug Northup and deliver him to a [[Slavery in the United States|slave pen]] run by a man named Burch. Northup proclaims that he is a free man, only to be savagely beaten with a wooden paddle and then a leather strap.\n\nNorthup is shipped to [[New Orleans]] along with other captive African-Americans. He is told by the others that if he wants to survive in the [[Southern United States|South]], he must adapt to being a slave and not tell anyone he is a free man. A slave trader named Theophilus Freeman gives Northup the identity of \"Platt\", a runaway slave from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and sells him to plantation owner [[William Prince Ford|William Ford]]. Ford takes a liking to Northup and gives him a violin. A growing tension between Northup and plantation carpenter John Tibeats finally breaks as Tibeats tries to beat Northup. Northup snaps and beats Tibeats with his hands before beating him with his own whip. Tibeats and his group try to hang Northup, but they are not successful. Northup is left on tiptoes with the noose around his neck for hours before Ford arrives and cuts Northup down. To save Northup's life, Ford sells him to another slave owner named Edwin Epps. In the process, Northup attempts to explain that he is actually a free man, but Ford tells him he is too afraid and that he cannot help him.\n\nEpps, unlike Ford, is ruthless and sadistic. Northup meets Patsey, a favored slave who can pick over 500 pounds of cotton a day, twice the usual quota. Epps regularly [[rape]]s Patsey while his wife abuses and humiliates her out of jealousy. Some time later, [[cotton worm]]s destroy Epps's crops. Unable to work his fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains the favor of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he uses the money to pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail a letter to his friends in New York. Armsby agrees and accepts Northup's saved money, but immediately betrays him to Epps. In the middle of the night, a drunken Epps wakes Northup and questions him menacingly about the letter while holding a knife to Northup's stomach. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and Epps relents. Afterwards, Northup mournfully burns the letter to prevent Epps from finding it. Some time later, Patsey is caught by Epps going to a neighboring plantation in order to acquire soap, as Mrs. Epps won't let her have any. In retaliation, Epps orders Northup to whip Patsey. Patsey is then whipped brutally by Epps, to the point of near death. After the incident, Northup destroys his violin in a rage.\n\nNorthup begins working on the construction of a [[gazebo]] with a [[Canadians|Canadian]] laborer named Samuel Bass. Bass is unsettled by the brutal way that Epps treats his slaves and expresses his opposition to slavery, earning Epps's enmity. Northup overhears the conversation and decides to reveal his kidnapping to Bass. Once again, Northup asks for help in getting a letter to New York. Although Bass is hesitant at first because of the risks, he agrees to send it. One day, the local sheriff arrives in a carriage with two men. The sheriff asks Northup a series of questions to confirm that his answers match the facts of his life in New York. Northup recognizes the sheriff's companion as Mr. Parker, a shopkeeper he knew in Saratoga Springs. Parker has come to free him, and the two embrace, though an enraged Epps furiously protests the circumstances and tries to prevent Northup from leaving. Northup gives an emotional farewell to Patsey and rides off to his freedom.\n\nNorthup is returned to his home and family, crying as he walks up the steps. As he walks in, he sees his wife with their fully grown son and daughter, and her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. Northup apologizes for his long absence while his family comforts him. The film's [[epilogue]] titles recount: Northup's unsuccessful suits against Brown, Hamilton, and Burch; the 1853 publication of Northup's [[slave narrative]] memoir, ''[[Twelve Years a Slave]]''; describes his role in the [[abolitionist movement]]; and the absence of any information surrounding the details of his death and burial.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Alfre Woodard 12 Years a Slave 60.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alfre Woodard]] at the premiere of ''12 Years a Slave'']]\n<!-- Cast as Billed in film per [[WP:CASTLIST]] -->\n<!-- Do not any more names unless they are notable (and include citations)-->\n{{Div col}}\n<!-- Billed one actor per screen -->\n*[[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as [[Solomon Northup]] / Platt\n*[[Michael Fassbender]] as Edwin Epps\n*[[Lupita Nyong'o]] as [[Patsey]]\n*[[Sarah Paulson]] as Mary Epps\n*[[Paul Dano]] as John Tibeats\n*[[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[William Prince Ford|William Ford]]\n*[[Alfre Woodard]] as Mistress Harriet Shaw\n*[[Brad Pitt]] as Samuel Bass\n*[[Adepero Oduye]] as Eliza\n*[[Garret Dillahunt]] as Armsby\n*[[Scoot McNairy]] as Merrill Brown\n*[[Taran Killam]] as Abram Hamilton\n*Christopher Berry as James H.
