At that time it was inhabited by the [[Buscaja]]s. The city was destroyed by Native Americans before 1600{{why|date=July 2019}}; it was later rebuilt.  Buenaventura thrived after the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914; and in the 1950s became a regular stopover for the 'international jet set'.

His mother, Jean, taught literature and enjoyed the company of writers. Busfield said he remembers coming home from school and finding his mother and English novelist [[Graham Greene]] sharing a drink at the kitchen table. Busfield studied drama at [[East Tennessee State University]] and appeared with [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]] before traveling to New York and roles with [[Circle Repertory Company]]. Busfield also briefly served in the U.S. Naval Reserve. A baseball lover and amateur athlete, Busfield has moonlighted as a semi-pro pitcher for the [http://www.sacsmokeys.com Sacramento Smokeys]. He is the brother-in-law of fellow ''West Wing'' actor [[Joshua Malina]].\n--> He landed his first professional acting job at 18 in a children's theater adaptation of Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. Busfield studied drama at East Tennessee State University and traveled frequently with the Actors Theater of Louisville, which took him to Europe and Israel. In 1981, he moved to New York City, NY, where he joined the Circle Repertory Company for their production of Lanford Wilson's ''Talley and Son''. That same year, he landed his first film role with a bit part as a mortar-bearing soldier in the comedy classic, ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' (1981).<ref>TIMOTHY BUSFIELD: Guest Artist of Media Acting (2013-2016). (n.d.). Retrieved from http://theatre.msu.edu/people/guest-artists-series/timothy-busfield/ </ref>\n\n==Career==\nMore stage work followed, including a stint as understudy to Matthew Broderick in ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' in 1982. The following year, Busfield relocated to Los Angeles to join the cast of ''[[Reggie (TV series)|Reggie]]'' (ABC, 1983), a short-lived comedy based on the British television series ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'' (BBC, 1976-79). The year 1984 proved to be a busy one for Busfield; not only did he land his first substantial film role as Arnold Poindexter, the goofiest of the geek fraternity brothers in the hit comedy ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'' (1984) and its 1987 sequel, but he joined the cast of the long-running drama ''[[Trapper John, M.D.]]'' (CBS, 1979-1986), starring as the son of Pernell Roberts' Trapper John McIntyre. He held the role until the series' conclusion in 1986. \n\nFollowing the demise of ''Trapper John'', he joined forces with his brother Buck to create the Fantasy Theatre, a professional touring company for children's audiences - and later Honorary State Children's Theater for California - based in his new hometown of Sacramento, CA. The Busfields also established the award-winning B Street Theater there in 1992, which was devoted to more adult productions. The following year, Busfield was cast as Elliot on ''[[thirtysomething]]''. The part was his first mature role to date, and the producers requested that he grow a beard to help sell his image as a married man and father. Over the course of the hit Yuppie show's three-season run, Elliot came to personify the best and worst aspects of the series: a successful advertising executive and father, Elliot also infuriated his friends and family (and viewers) with his marital infidelity and competitive streak with partner Michael Steadman (Ken Olin), all of which went on while his wife Nancy (Patricia Wettig) struggled with ovarian cancer. Despite his character's unpleasant tendencies, Busfield brought humor and honesty to the role, and was nominated three times for an Emmy before winning one in 1991, shortly before conflicts between the producers and cast brought the show to an abrupt conclusion. \n\nBusfield had remained exceptionally busy during his ''thirtysomething'' stint, appearing as the nominal villain in the popular Kevin Costner fantasy ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' in 1989, and in 1990, replacing Tom Hulce as the lead in ''[[A Few Good Men]]'', a smash Broadway production written by [[Aaron Sorkin]], with whom he would later enjoy fruitful collaborations. He also made his directorial debut with a 1990 episode of ''thirtysomething'', and would helm three episodes of the series before it ran its course. Roles in television features and theatrical films followed, including supporting turns in ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' (1992), ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' (1994) and the likable kids' fantasy ''[[Little Big League]]'' (1994), which allowed Busfield to show off his baseball skills as the first baseman for the Minnesota Twins (an avowed baseball fan, Busfield occasionally served as pitcher in several minor league games). His character, Lou Collins, was loosely based on Twins legend [[Kent Hrbek]]. Hrbek would serve as a consultant on the film and he and Busfield became friends.\n\nBusfield returned to network television several times during the late 1990s for high profile shows that never quite caught on with viewers. He was the patriarch of the Byrd clan, which moved from Connecticut to Hawaii in the Steven Bochco-produced ''[[The Byrds of Paradise]]'' (ABC, 1993-94), and starred as one of a group of former high school jocks still clinging to their glory days in ''[[Champs (TV series)|Champs]]'' (ABC, 1996) for Ron Howard. \n\nBy the late 1990s, Busfield was dividing his time between acting and directing for television, helming multiple episodes of several shows, including Sorkin's ''[[Sports Night]]'' (ABC, 1998-2000), as well as ''[[Ed (TV series)|Ed]]'' (NBC, 2000-04), for which he also served as associate producer and guest star (as Ed's down-on-his-luck brother Lloyd). During this period, Busfield also began his recurring role as Pulitzer Prize-winning White House correspondent - and love interest to Allison Janney's C.J. Cregg - Danny Concannon on ''[[The West Wing]]''. He would appear sporadically on the show throughout its entire network run.<ref>TIMOTHY BUSFIELD: Guest Artist of Media Acting (2013-2016). (n.d.). Retrieved from http://theatre.msu.edu/people/guest-artists-series/timothy-busfield/</ref>\n\nBusfield kept a foot on both sides of the camera from 2000 on; directing and executive producing the successful CBS drama ''[[Without a Trace]]'' (2002-) and appearing occasionally as the wheelchair-bound divorce attorney for Anthony LaPaglia's Jack Malone. He also directed episodes of ''Las Vegas'' (NBC, 2003-), ''Damages'' (FX, 2007- ), and ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]''. On the latter, he also co-starred on the short-lived Aaron Sorkin series as Cal Shanley, the occasionally nerve-plagued control director for the program's self-titled show-within-a-show. Though that show was ultimately cancelled, despite much marketing as the \"next big thing,\" in 2007, Busfield moved on, serving as executive producer of the Brooke Shields-led drama, ''Lipstick Jungle'' (NBC, 2008-2009).\n\nIn 2019, ''[[Guest Artist]]'', directed by Busfield, premiered at the [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]]. The film is written by, and stars [[Jeff Daniels]]. ''Guest Artist'' was shot on location in New York City, and in Daniels' hometown of [[Chelsea, Michigan|Chelsea, MI]].

He held the role until the series' conclusion in 1986. \n\nFollowing the demise of ''Trapper John'', he joined forces with his brother Buck to create the Fantasy Theatre, a professional touring company for children's audiences - and later Honorary State Children's Theater for California - based in his new hometown of Sacramento, CA. The Busfields also established the award-winning B Street Theater there in 1992, which was devoted to more adult productions. The following year, Busfield was cast as Elliot on ''[[thirtysomething]]''. The part was his first mature role to date, and the producers requested that he grow a beard to help sell his image as a married man and father. Over the course of the hit Yuppie show's three-season run, Elliot came to personify the best and worst aspects of the series: a successful advertising executive and father, Elliot also infuriated his friends and family (and viewers) with his marital infidelity and competitive streak with partner Michael Steadman (Ken Olin), all of which went on while his wife Nancy (Patricia Wettig) struggled with ovarian cancer. Despite his character's unpleasant tendencies, Busfield brought humor and honesty to the role, and was nominated three times for an Emmy before winning one in 1991, shortly before conflicts between the producers and cast brought the show to an abrupt conclusion. \n\nBusfield had remained exceptionally busy during his ''thirtysomething'' stint, appearing as the nominal villain in the popular Kevin Costner fantasy ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' in 1989, and in 1990, replacing Tom Hulce as the lead in ''[[A Few Good Men]]'', a smash Broadway production written by [[Aaron Sorkin]], with whom he would later enjoy fruitful collaborations. He also made his directorial debut with a 1990 episode of ''thirtysomething'', and would helm three episodes of the series before it ran its course. Roles in television features and theatrical films followed, including supporting turns in ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' (1992), ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' (1994) and the likable kids' fantasy ''[[Little Big League]]'' (1994), which allowed Busfield to show off his baseball skills as the first baseman for the Minnesota Twins (an avowed baseball fan, Busfield occasionally served as pitcher in several minor league games). His character, Lou Collins, was loosely based on Twins legend [[Kent Hrbek]]. Hrbek would serve as a consultant on the film and he and Busfield became friends.\n\nBusfield returned to network television several times during the late 1990s for high profile shows that never quite caught on with viewers. He was the patriarch of the Byrd clan, which moved from Connecticut to Hawaii in the Steven Bochco-produced ''[[The Byrds of Paradise]]'' (ABC, 1993-94), and starred as one of a group of former high school jocks still clinging to their glory days in ''[[Champs (TV series)|Champs]]'' (ABC, 1996) for Ron Howard. \n\nBy the late 1990s, Busfield was dividing his time between acting and directing for television, helming multiple episodes of several shows, including Sorkin's ''[[Sports Night]]'' (ABC, 1998-2000), as well as ''[[Ed (TV series)|Ed]]'' (NBC, 2000-04), for which he also served as associate producer and guest star (as Ed's down-on-his-luck brother Lloyd). During this period, Busfield also began his recurring role as Pulitzer Prize-winning White House correspondent - and love interest to Allison Janney's C.J. Cregg - Danny Concannon on ''[[The West Wing]]''. He would appear sporadically on the show throughout its entire network run.<ref>TIMOTHY BUSFIELD: Guest Artist of Media Acting (2013-2016). (n.d.). Retrieved from http://theatre.msu.edu/people/guest-artists-series/timothy-busfield/</ref>\n\nBusfield kept a foot on both sides of the camera from 2000 on; directing and executive producing the successful CBS drama ''[[Without a Trace]]'' (2002-) and appearing occasionally as the wheelchair-bound divorce attorney for Anthony LaPaglia's Jack Malone. He also directed episodes of ''Las Vegas'' (NBC, 2003-), ''Damages'' (FX, 2007- ), and ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]''. On the latter, he also co-starred on the short-lived Aaron Sorkin series as Cal Shanley, the occasionally nerve-plagued control director for the program's self-titled show-within-a-show. Though that show was ultimately cancelled, despite much marketing as the \"next big thing,\" in 2007, Busfield moved on, serving as executive producer of the Brooke Shields-led drama, ''Lipstick Jungle'' (NBC, 2008-2009).\n\nIn 2019, ''[[Guest Artist]]'', directed by Busfield, premiered at the [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]]. The film is written by, and stars [[Jeff Daniels]]. ''Guest Artist'' was shot on location in New York City, and in Daniels' hometown of [[Chelsea, Michigan|Chelsea, MI]]. This film marks the launch of Grand River Productions, a production company with Daniels, Busfield, and Melissa Gilbert.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/guest-artist-jeff-daniels-timothy-busfield-melissa-gilbert-grand-river-productions-company-1202551709/|title=Jeff Daniels, Timothy Busfield & Melissa Gilbert Launch Grand River Productions|last=Hipes|first=Mike Fleming Jr,Patrick|last2=Jr|first2=Mike Fleming|date=2019-02-07|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-03-16|last3=Hipes|first3=Patrick}}</ref>\n\n===Stage and theater===\nBusfield remains a stage actor and director whose [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] credits include ''[[A Few Good Men (play)|A Few Good Men]]'' and ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'', where he was star [[Matthew Broderick]]'s understudy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/brighton-beach-memoirs-4212|title=Brighton Beach Memoirs \u2013 Broadway Play \u2013 Original {{!}} IBDB|website=www.ibdb.com|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> Off-Broadway, he worked with [[Circle Repertory Company]] in 1982.

Jun Lee spent most of his childhood on a small farm.\n\nIn middle school, Jun Lee met Master Kang, who was his first Taekwondo master. Master Kang ran the Oh Do Kwan [[Dojang]] in Gochang. Jun Lee became one of Kang's top students, earning his black belt at the age of 13.\n[[File:Mechild1.jpg|alt=|thumb|293x293px|Jun Lee Childhood]]\nIn the early 1970s with the Vietnam war winding down, many young Korean Taekwondo masters immigrated to the United States, including Jun Lee\u2019s older brother, Hyeon Kon Lee. Hyeon Kon Lee opened one of the first Taekwondo dojangs in [[Virginia]].<ref>\u201cK.S. Lee's Tae Kwon Do Carolina.\u201d ''[http://nctkd.com/lee-brothers K.S.

He graduated with a [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor\u2019s degree]] in Science in Economics. After his graduation, Jun Lee began to teach at his brother\u2019s dojang.\n\n== Taekwondo activities ==\n\n=== First dojang ===\nJun Lee and his brother Hyeon Lee believed that the [[Research Triangle]] area in [[North Carolina]] would be an ideal location to open a dojang. The Triangle was a growing area of educated middle to upper-class families, who would be keener on and better able to afford Taekwondo lessons. In February of 1987, Jun Lee left Virginia and moved to Raleigh<ref name=\":0\">O'Hare, Michael. \u201cInterview with Grandmaster Jun Lee II.\u201d 3 Oct. 2019</ref>.\n\nIt was an opportune time in the US to be involved in the martial arts industry, which was experiencing phenomenal growth. The [[International Olympic Committee]] had named Taekwondo Sparring as a demonstration sport for the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Olympics]]. Films like ''[[The Karate Kid|Karate Kid]]'' had caught the attention of young Americans.\n\nJun Lee arrived in Raleigh in the winter. Being new to the area and only knowing his brother, he lived in an Aerostar Van he owned.\n\nJun Lee rented a small commercial space in a strip mall that was in need of renovation. For a month, Jun Lee worked to renovate the space. \n\nBy early spring the renovations were complete, and Jun Lee\u2019s dojang opened. The dojang was small, at just 2,700 square feet. \n\nDuring the day, Jun Lee promoted his business by giving free martial arts demonstrations at gas stations, schools and county fairs. In the evenings, he taught Taekwondo classes. New students trickled in at first, but the pace quickly picked up. By the end of the year, Jun Lee had more students than capacity for his dojang.\n\nWith his success, Jun Lee opened several more dojangs in the Research Triangle area. As his older brother had done with him, Jun Lee placed his other brothers in charge of these locations.  \n\n=== Teaching philosophy ===\nJun Lee realized that martial arts, specifically Taekwondo, were more than just kicking and punching.

Jun Lee began to put his own stamp on the Korean martial art of Taekwondo. Jun Lee recognized early on that, due to cultural differences, some elements of Korean Taekwondo did not translate well into American culture. Americans strive to be individualistic and shun conformity, where Koreans strive to conform and shun individualism. Jun Lee had to adapt his teaching to his adopted culture. He had to develop new ideas on his own, while at the same time preserving traditional Taekwondo culture.\n\nAmerican culture allowed Jun Lee to add his teaching philosophy to Taekwondo, which would be unthinkable back in Seoul, not to mention his hometown. He changed the name of his dojangs to Black Belt World, to encompass his teaching philosophy based on the humanistic Korean concept of Hongik Ingan. This philosophy instills loyalty to one\u2019s country, honor to one\u2019s parents, respect for elders, care for juniors, positive relationships with teachers, treating all things with care, never seeking advantage over the weak, using Taekwondo to benefit others, and finishing what you start.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nJun Lee believes that if all people practiced Taekwondo and introduced these qualities and values into their lives, not only would society be better off, but it would be much more liberated.

Since the development of the medium, the presence in films of any form of sexuality has been controversial. Some films containing sex scenes have been criticized by religious groups or have been banned or the subject of censorship by governments, or both. In countries with a [[film rating system]], films containing sex scenes typically receive a restricted classification. [[Nudity in film]] may be regarded as sexual or as non-sexual.\n\nAn '''erotic film''' is usually a film that has an [[eroticism|erotic]] [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] that causes the creation of [[Human sexuality|sexual]] feelings,<ref name=merriam>{{cite web |title=Eroticism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eroticism|work=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=7 August 2011}}</ref> as well as a philosophical contemplation concerning the [[aesthetic]]s of sexual desire, [[sensuality]] and [[romantic love]].\n\nLove scenes, erotic or not, have been present in films since the [[silent era]] of [[cinematography]]. A [[pornographic film]], on the other hand, is a sex film which does not usually claim any artistic merit. Sex scenes have been presented in many genres of film, although there are some in which it is rare. Many actors and actresses have performed nude or partial nude scenes, or have dressed and behaved in ways considered sexually provocative by [[Modesty#Modesty in dress|contemporary standards]] at some point in their careers.\n\n==Terminology==\nSex in film can be distinguished from a sex film, which usually refers to a pornographic film and sometimes to a [[sex education]] film. It should also be distinguished from nudity in film, though nudity can be presented in a sexualized context. For example, [[nudity]] in the context of [[naturism]] would normally be regarded as non-sexual. Some people distinguish between \"gratuitous sex\" and sex scenes which are presented as integral to a film's plot or as part of the character development.\n\nSex scenes are the main feature of pornographic films. In [[softcore pornography|softcore]] films, sexuality is less explicit. [[Erotic]] films are suggestive of sexuality, but need not contain nudity.\n\n==Production==\nAs actors take high risk and are highly vulnerable by the sex scenes, it is important that actors sign up an agreement and have an opportunity to negotiate the terms of the scene to prioritize their safety. Therefore, if the movie/TV show will have any simulated sex or [[Nudity in film|nude scenes]], then before signing the contract, the production gives a written nudity rider for actors to sign. A nudity rider is a written agreements between production and actors to agree on terms of details of the sex scenes and the surroundings of the studio when the sex scenes will be shot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://firemark.com/2015/11/02/nudityrider/|title=Nudity Riders - What they are, why you need them.|last=Firemark|first=Gordon|date=2015-11-02|website=Entertainment Law Offices of Gordon P. Firemark|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> One of the agreements is that while an intimate scene is being shot, only people associated with the scene or material can stay. Also, taking photographs is not allowed, and these scenes are not used in the promotion of the film, unless that is part of the agreement. [[Body double|Body doubles]], a person replacing the performer, can be used only if the performer gives consent, or if the performer who initially agreed to the scene later decided against it. The agreements apply to auditions too. Also, the agreements should include the detailed descriptions including how much the actors have to be nude, i.e. nude or semi-nude, and information on their attire.\n\nTo tackle the physical and psychological safety of the actors involved in sex scenes, Intimacy Directors International (IDI)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamidi.org/about-idi|title=Our Organization|website=intimacydirection|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>, a not for profit organization was established. According to IDI, IDI has an [[intimacy coordinator]] who works with actors and does following:\n\n# Work professionally with actors to set rules when they engage in any type of sex scenes that includes simulated sex, [[nudity]], and intimate scenes.\n# They are the bridge between actors and producers.\n# Direct scenes where it includes simulated sex, nudity and intimacy scenes. \n# Support actors and advocate for them.\n\nThe production can hire the IDI's intimacy coordinator if the following situations arises:\n\n# If the scene include simulated sex or nudity of any kind, and they need a nudity rider, then they should hire an intimacy coordinator.\n# If an actor needs help in dealing with sensitive material.\n# If the director needs help directing a sex scene.\n# If the production wants to make specific rules for the actors to feel safer.\n\nSince the 2010s, film and TV productions increasingly employ [[intimacy coordinator]]s to ensure the wellbeing of actors who participate in sex scenes, and to help prevent harassment and violations of consent.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Martinelli |first1=Marissa |title=HBO Will Use \"Intimacy Coordinators\" for All of Its Sex Scenes |url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/hbo-sex-scenes-the-deuce-watchman-intimacy-coordinators.html |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=Slate Magazine |date=29 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref> \n\n==Europe==\n{{expand section|date=February 2014}}\n[[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] of Spain is a prolific director who has included eroticism in many of his movies. [[Tinto Brass]] of Italy has dedicated his career to bringing explicit sexuality into [[mainstream]] cinema. His films are also notable for [[feminist]]-friendly eroticism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} French filmmaker [[Catherine Breillat]] caused controversy with [[unsimulated sex]] in her films ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'' (1999) and ''[[Anatomy of Hell]]'' (2004). In Italy, nudity and strong sexual themes go back to the silent era with films such as ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1926 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1926). [[Lars von Trier]] of Denmark has included explicit/unsimulated sex scenes in some of his films, such as ''[[Breaking the Waves]]'' (1996), ''[[The Idiots]]'' (1998), ''[[Manderley Castle|Manderlay]]'' (2005), ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]'' (2009), and ''[[Nymphomaniac (film)|Nymphomaniac]]'' (2013). He is also a co-founder of film company [[Puzzy Power]], a subsidiary of his [[Zentropa]], with the goal of producing [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] [[pornographic film]]s for women. ''[[Blue is the Warmest Colour]]'' (2013) sparked an international firestorm over its frank depiction of sexuality between two young women, yet managed to win the [[Palme d'Or]], the highest prize awarded at the prestigious [[Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2013. ''[[Love (2015 film)|Love]]'' (2015) contains many explicit unsimulated sex scenes.\n\n==United States==\n[[File:Lorna Poster.jpg|thumb|''[[Lorna (film)|Lorna]]'' (1964) was the first of [[Russ Meyer]]'s films where the main female part, played in this film by [[Lorna Maitland]], was selected on the basis of her large [[breast]] size]]\n\nThe inclusion in film of any form of sexuality has been controversial since the development of the medium. [[Kiss#Kissing in films|Kissing in films]], for example, was initially considered by some to be scandalous. ''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]]'' (1896) contained a kiss, which was regarded as a sex scene and drew general outrage from movie goers, civic leaders, and religious leaders, as utterly shocking, [[obscenity|obscene]] and completely immoral. One contemporary critic wrote, \"The spectacle of the prolonged pasturing on each other's lips was beastly enough in life size on the stage but magnified to gargantuan proportions and repeated three times over it is absolutely disgusting.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xq5FAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA239 The Chap-book, Volume 5, Number 5, July 15, 1896 ]</ref> The Catholic Church called for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution.<ref name=sexinfilms1>[http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms1.html Sex in Cinema: Pre-1920s]</ref> Perhaps in defiance of the righteous indignation and \"to spice up a film\", the film was followed by many kiss imitators, including ''[[The Kiss in the Tunnel]]'' (1899) and ''The Kiss'' (1900). Other producers would take the criticism on board, or in mock of the standard, and use an implicit kiss, which would be obstructed from view just as the lips would touch, such as shielding a possible kiss by placing say a hat in front of the actors' faces, or fading to grey just as a kiss is to take place, etc.\n\nThe display of cleavage created controversy. For example, producer [[Howard Hughes]] displayed [[Jane Russell]]'s cleavage in ''[[The Outlaw]]'' (1943) and in ''[[The French Line]]'' (1953), which was found objectionable under the [[Hays Code]] because of Russell's \"breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure\" while some of her [[decollete]] gowns were regarded to be \"intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Doherty, Thomas |author2=Doherty, Thomas Patrick |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007 |title=Hollywood's censor: Joseph I.

Producers such as [[Russ Meyer]] produced films which featured actresses with large breasts. ''[[Lorna (film)|Lorna]]'' (1964) was the first of his films where the main female part, played by [[Lorna Maitland]], was selected on the basis of breast size. The producers and exhibitors of the film were prosecuted for obscenity in several US states. Other large breasted actresses used by Meyer include [[Kitten Natividad]], [[Erica Gavin]], [[Tura Satana]], and [[Uschi Digard]] among many others. The majority of them were naturally large breasted and he occasionally cast women in their first trimesters of pregnancy to enhance their breast size even further.<ref name=russmeyer>{{cite book |last1=Meyer |first1=Russ |others=(Under the pseudonym \"Adolph Albion Schwartz\") |year=2000 | title=''A Clean Breast: The Life and Loves of Russ Meyer'' (3 volume set) |publisher=Hauck Pub Co |location=El Rio, TX |isbn=0-9621797-2-8}}</ref> Author and director [[William Rotsler]] said: \"with ''Lorna'' Meyer established the formula that made him rich and famous, the formula of people filmed at top hate, top lust, top heavy.\"<ref>{{cite book|author= McDonough, Jimmy|year=2005| title=''Big bosoms and square jaws : the biography of Russ Meyer, king of the sex film'' | publisher=Jonathan Cape | location=London | isbn=0-224-07250-1}}, p.138</ref>\n\n''[[Blue Movie]]'' (1969), directed by [[Andy Warhol]],<ref name=\"NYT-19690722\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Movie Review - Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-19690810\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie.

Most dramas center around character development, such as [[Steven Shainberg]]'s ''[[Secretary (2002 film)|Secretary]]'' (2002). Comedy films, especially romantic comedies and romantic dramas, tend toward character interaction.\n\nMystery films, thrillers, drama and horror films tend toward strong plots and premises, such as ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (1972), ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'' (1980), ''[[Body Heat]]'' (1981), ''[[Nine 1/2 Weeks]]'' (1986), ''[[Angel Heart]]'' (1987), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Single White Female]]'' (1992), ''[[Color of Night]]'' (1994), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), ''[[Leaving Las Vegas]]'' (1995), ''[[Total Eclipse (film)|Total Eclipse]]'' (1995), ''[[Different Strokes (film)|Different Strokes]]'' (1997), ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]'' (1998), ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' (1999) and ''[[In the Cut]]'' (2003).<ref name=\"CB1\" /> Others, like ''[[About Last Night...]]'' (1986), ''[[Monster's Ball]]'' (2001), ''[[Chloe (film)|Chloe]]'' (2009), ''[[Love & Other Drugs]]'' (2010), ''[[Blue Valentine (film)|Blue Valentine]]'' (2010), ''[[Shame (2011 film)|Shame]]'' (2011), ''[[Compliance (film)|Compliance]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Sessions (film)|The Sessions]]'' (2012) combine both strong plots and characters.<ref name=\"CB1\">{{cite web|last=Lundin |first=Leigh |url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=13152 |title=Erotic Mystery Thrillers |work=Sex-n-violence |publisher=Criminal Brief |date=2010-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100324/REVIEWS/100329990/1023 |title=Chloe|publisher=Rogerebert.com |date=March 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Thrillers====\n[[Erotic thriller]]s are a popular American erotic subgenre, with films such as ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'' (1980), ''[[Angel Heart]]'' (1987), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Single White Female]]'' (1992), ''[[Color of Night]]'' (1994), ''[[The Maddening]]'' (1995), ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]'' (1998), ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' (1999), ''[[In the Cut]]'' (2003), ''[[Chloe (film)|Chloe]]'' (2009), ''[[Compliance (film)|Compliance]]'' (2012), and ''[[The Boy Next Door (film)|The Boy Next Door]]'' (2015).<ref name=\"CB1\"/> In some films, the development of a sexual relationship (or even a [[one-night stand]]) is often used to create tension in the storyline, especially if the people involved should not be sleeping together, such as in ''[[Out of Sight]]'' (1998), where a [[U.S. Marshal]] has sex with the criminal she is pursuing.\n\n====Horror====\nIn [[horror film]]s, sex is often used to ''mark'' characters that are doomed to die. Characters that engage in sex acts are often the first to be claimed by the antagonist(s), or will die shortly after their sex scene or (sometimes) in the middle of it. This convention of it being bad luck to have sex in a horror film is notably illustrated in the ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' film series, where supernatural villain [[Jason Voorhees]] takes a special dislike to teenagers and young adults having sex because, as a young boy, he drowned in a lake while the camp counselors who should have been supervising him were having sex.\n\nIn some interpretations of this \"rule\", the sex acts themselves directly cause the character's demise. In ''[[Cabin Fever (2002 film)|Cabin Fever]]'', a man catches the deadly illness because a woman who was infected (but not yet symptomatic) seduces and has impulsive sex with him. They don't use a [[condom]] because the careless woman believes she is healthy. Ironically, the woman (and the audience) only realize that she is infected because of red welts that are brought out by their rough lovemaking. ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' (1995) and its sequels also feature many sexual deaths as virtually every human who mates with an alien in the franchise subsequently dies - female aliens kill human suitors regardless of whether they have poor genes, resist the alien's advances, or mate successfully. Human women who mate with alien men die shortly after sex as their abdomens burst during the unnaturally rapid pregnancy that always follows.\n\nMost times in horror movies the [[final girl|typical survivor]] is a young girl who is still a virgin. In the film ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'', which satirizes horror movies, this rule is somewhat broken as the character [[List of Scream (film series) characters|Randy Meeks]] points out that one of the rules of horrors is to not have sex. In an intersecting scene, the film's main [[protagonist]] [[Sidney Prescott]] loses her virginity to Billy Loomis. After they finish, Billy is stabbed by [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] and Sidney is then chased. Randy himself survives a gunshot wound at the end of the film because, as he explains, he is a virgin. However, he dies in the sequel, ''[[Scream 2]]'', after which it is revealed that he lost his virginity sometime prior to his death.\n\n==Mexican==\nIn Mexico, many comedy films are based on sex, typically portraying men as unstoppable sex-seeking creatures and women as willing targets. Although the number of such comedies waned during the 1990s, domestic servants, bar workers, dancers and neighbors' wives continue to be depicted as potentially willing sexual partners.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The films ''[[La Tarea]]'' (1991), ''[[Miracle Alley]]'' (1995) and ''[[Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n]]'' (2001) are some of the most important examples of this.{{According to whom|date=May 2017}}\n\n==India==\nThe [[Cinema of India|entertainment industry]] is an important part of modern India, and is expressive of [[India#Society|Indian society]] in general.

Because of the limited films featuring same-sex sex scenes before 2010s, researchers were unable to research people's views on the intimate scenes between lesbians. In 2016, researchers Maria T. Soto-Sanfiel and Adriana Ibiti created a report on pleasurable sensations created by watching sexual scenes between lesbian couples. People, including [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] individuals, reported that the scenes had different effects on their [[sexual arousal]]. The reasons were different for everyone who identified themselves as either heterosexual or [[Homosexuality|homosexual]], male or female.

Gay men preferred seeing heterosexual scenes because they could imagine themselves in place of the women.\n\nFrench film ''[[La vie d'Ad\u00e8le]]'' (''Blue Is the Warmest Color'', in English), directed by [[Abdellatif Kechiche]], was released in October 2013. The film is about a high school student Adele who lusts after art student Lea and falls in love with her. The film explores the lesbian relationship between them and their transformation as characters. To showcase their developing characters, the three-hour long film contained almost ten minutes of sexual scenes between them. These scenes were so long that even heterosexual scenes in movies have not exceeded the length. The scenes were shot in a close-up manner, showing great detail with bold and intimate camera angles.<ref name=\"soto-sanfiel\" /> Many critics said that if it was not a film, the sex scenes would be close to [[pornography]]. The sex scenes were controversial and received mixed reviews. France set the age limit to 12 years, Singapore 21 years, and Brazil opposed to print [[Blu-ray|blu-rays]]. The movie earned around $20 million in US and Europe. It was shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and won the highest award, [[Palme d'Or]]. It also won many international awards around the world. A film [[Carol (film)|Carol]], directed by [[Todd Haynes]], was released in November 2015, also caught a lot of attention. The movie was about a young woman named Therese Belivet (played by [[Rooney Mara]]), who falls in love with an older women named Carol Aird (played by [[Cate Blanchett]]). It's set during  Christmas, 1952, and Therese is working at the Manhattan upscale department store, where she meets Carol who is buying toys for her daughter. Carol intentionally forgets her gloves, and invites Therese for lunch. Therese goes to Carol's house and finds out about her difficulties where her husband is trying to get a divorce. Carol's husband Harge (played by [[Kyle Chandler]]) accidentally sees Carol with Therese while he was picking up their daughter to take her to France. If proof about Carol's homosexuality is found, Harge can convict her and take full custody of their daughter and restrict her from visiting her. Harge hires an investigator to prove Carol's homosexuality. On the [[New Year's Eve]], Carol and Therese have sex for the first time. Later, they found out that they were being recorded and the evidence was already sent to Harge. Therefore, Carol requests Harge to keep their daughter in custody but let her visit her. Carol and Theresa finally unite at the end. The movie included 3 minutes of sex scenes between Carol and Theresa. The sex scenes are carefully shot with the actors shown half nude, and it does not contain explicit scenes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/cate-blanchett-carol-cannes-review-796213|title='Carol': Cannes Review|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref> Haynes while talking about the production of the sex scenes said that actors pretend that they are not nervous, but he added that: \"But they are. So I try to create an environment that's comfortable and predictable. You set your shots, get rid of people that don't need to be there - and then you basically just go.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/making-carol-why-took-60-851607|title=Making of 'Carol': Why It Took 60 Years to Film the Lesbian Love Story|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref> In the past, sex scenes between same-sex couple not only made the actors uncomfortable, but they were also stigmatized, considered shocking or even immoral. But, this has changed greatly and many movies about same-sex relationships have been made.\n\nIn addition to an increasing focus on relationships between lesbians in film, but there are also many recent movies that focus on gay male relationships as well. An Italian movie [[Call Me by Your Name (film)|Call me by your name]], directed by [[Luca Guadagnino]], was released on January 2017. The film is about a 17-year-old American-Jewish, named Elio (played by [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet|Timothee Chalamet]]) forming a relationship with a 24-year old graduate student Oliver.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/04/call-me-by-your-name-an-erotic-triumph|title=\"Call Me by Your Name\": An Erotic Triumph|last=Lane|first=Anthony|date=2017-11-24|access-date=2019-12-02|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> The movie is set in the summer of 1983, where Elio is a son of archaeology Professor, Professor Perlmann. Professor Perlmann invites his annual assistant for the year, Oliver, who will live with them during this time. Elio does not have much interest in Oliver in the beginning. During the summer, Elio  reads books, listens to music, or stays with his girlfriend, Marzia. Oliver tries to annoy Elio by telling him that he has a crush on a local girl. Elio tries to annoy Oliver by starting a sexual relationship with his girlfriend Marzia. But, soon, Elio starts getting attracted to Oliver. Elio asks to have a relationship with Oliver, but Oliver does not agree initially. But, later that day, they kiss. After Elio insists on meeting him, Oliver agrees, and meets him at midnight where they both have sex. As their relationship progresses, they keep getting more closer to each other physically and emotionally, and they have sex multiple times while keeping their relationship secret. It also becomes clear that Elio's parents knew about their relationship. Before Oliver leaves, Elio's parents recommend they go to Bergamo. Later, after Oliver leaves, Elio is sad and his father talks about how he was also in this same type of relationship before. He ask him to stay strong and learn from it. At the end, Oliver calls Elio's parents telling them he is engaged to be married. The movie ends with Elio's being sad and in sorrow. The sex scenes included showed the actors half naked and the scenes were short.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film|Human sexuality|Erotica and pornography}}\n* [[Erotic thriller]]\n* [[Golden Age of Porn]]\n* [[Nudity in film]]\n* [[Pre-Code sex films]]\n* [[Sex symbol]]\n* \n* \n* \n* [[Unsimulated sex]]\n* [[Sexposition]]\n* [[Kiss#Kissing in films|Kissing in films]]\n* [[Media and gender]]\n* [[Exploitation of women in mass media]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Andrews, David (2006) ''Soft in the Middle: the contemporary softcore feature in its contexts''.

Since the development of the medium, the presence in films of any form of sexuality has been controversial. Some films containing sex scenes have been criticized by religious groups or have been banned or the subject of censorship by governments, or both. In countries with a [[film rating system]], films containing sex scenes typically receive a restricted classification. [[Nudity in film]] may be regarded as sexual or as non-sexual.\n\nAn '''erotic film''' is usually a film that has an [[eroticism|erotic]] [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] that causes the creation of [[Human sexuality|sexual]] feelings,<ref name=merriam>{{cite web |title=Eroticism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eroticism|work=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=7 August 2011}}</ref> as well as a philosophical contemplation concerning the [[aesthetic]]s of sexual desire, [[sensuality]] and [[romantic love]].\n\nLove scenes, erotic or not, have been present in films since the [[silent era]] of [[cinematography]]. A [[pornographic film]], on the other hand, is a sex film which does not usually claim any artistic merit. Sex scenes have been presented in many genres of film, although there are some in which it is rare. Many actors and actresses have performed nude or partial nude scenes, or have dressed and behaved in ways considered sexually provocative by [[Modesty#Modesty in dress|contemporary standards]] at some point in their careers.\n\n==Terminology==\nSex in film can be distinguished from a sex film, which usually refers to a pornographic film and sometimes to a [[sex education]] film. It should also be distinguished from nudity in film, though nudity can be presented in a sexualized context. For example, [[nudity]] in the context of [[naturism]] would normally be regarded as non-sexual. Some people distinguish between \"gratuitous sex\" and sex scenes which are presented as integral to a film's plot or as part of the character development.\n\nSex scenes are the main feature of pornographic films. In [[softcore pornography|softcore]] films, sexuality is less explicit. [[Erotic]] films are suggestive of sexuality, but need not contain nudity.\n\n==Production==\nAs actors take high risk and are highly vulnerable by the sex scenes, it is important that actors sign up an agreement and have an opportunity to negotiate the terms of the scene to prioritize their safety. Therefore, if the movie/TV show will have any simulated sex or [[Nudity in film|nude scenes]], then before signing the contract, the production gives a written nudity rider for actors to sign. A nudity rider is a written agreements between production and actors to agree on terms of details of the sex scenes and the surroundings of the studio when the sex scenes will be shot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://firemark.com/2015/11/02/nudityrider/|title=Nudity Riders - What they are, why you need them.|last=Firemark|first=Gordon|date=2015-11-02|website=Entertainment Law Offices of Gordon P. Firemark|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> One of the agreements is that while an intimate scene is being shot, only people associated with the scene or material can stay. Also, taking photographs is not allowed, and these scenes are not used in the promotion of the film, unless that is part of the agreement. [[Body double|Body doubles]], a person replacing the performer, can be used only if the performer gives consent, or if the performer who initially agreed to the scene later decided against it. The agreements apply to auditions too. Also, the agreements should include the detailed descriptions including how much the actors have to be nude, i.e. nude or semi-nude, and information on their attire.\n\nTo tackle the physical and psychological safety of the actors involved in sex scenes, Intimacy Directors International (IDI)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamidi.org/about-idi|title=Our Organization|website=intimacydirection|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>, a not for profit organization was established. According to IDI, IDI has an [[intimacy coordinator]] who works with actors and does following:\n\n# Work professionally with actors to set rules when they engage in any type of sex scenes that includes simulated sex, [[nudity]], and intimate scenes.\n# They are the bridge between actors and producers.\n# Direct scenes where it includes simulated sex, nudity and intimacy scenes. \n# Support actors and advocate for them.\n\nThe production can hire the IDI's intimacy coordinator if the following situations arises:\n\n# If the scene include simulated sex or nudity of any kind, and they need a nudity rider, then they should hire an intimacy coordinator.\n# If an actor needs help in dealing with sensitive material.\n# If the director needs help directing a sex scene.\n# If the production wants to make specific rules for the actors to feel safer.\n\nSince the 2010s, film and TV productions increasingly employ [[intimacy coordinator]]s to ensure the wellbeing of actors who participate in sex scenes, and to help prevent harassment and violations of consent.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Martinelli |first1=Marissa |title=HBO Will Use \"Intimacy Coordinators\" for All of Its Sex Scenes |url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/hbo-sex-scenes-the-deuce-watchman-intimacy-coordinators.html |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=Slate Magazine |date=29 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref> \n\n==Europe==\n{{expand section|date=February 2014}}\n[[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] of Spain is a prolific director who has included eroticism in many of his movies. [[Tinto Brass]] of Italy has dedicated his career to bringing explicit sexuality into [[mainstream]] cinema. His films are also notable for [[feminist]]-friendly eroticism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} French filmmaker [[Catherine Breillat]] caused controversy with [[unsimulated sex]] in her films ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'' (1999) and ''[[Anatomy of Hell]]'' (2004). In Italy, nudity and strong sexual themes go back to the silent era with films such as ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1926 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1926). [[Lars von Trier]] of Denmark has included explicit/unsimulated sex scenes in some of his films, such as ''[[Breaking the Waves]]'' (1996), ''[[The Idiots]]'' (1998), ''[[Manderley Castle|Manderlay]]'' (2005), ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]'' (2009), and ''[[Nymphomaniac (film)|Nymphomaniac]]'' (2013). He is also a co-founder of film company [[Puzzy Power]], a subsidiary of his [[Zentropa]], with the goal of producing [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] [[pornographic film]]s for women. ''[[Blue is the Warmest Colour]]'' (2013) sparked an international firestorm over its frank depiction of sexuality between two young women, yet managed to win the [[Palme d'Or]], the highest prize awarded at the prestigious [[Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2013. ''[[Love (2015 film)|Love]]'' (2015) contains many explicit unsimulated sex scenes.\n\n==United States==\n[[File:Lorna Poster.jpg|thumb|''[[Lorna (film)|Lorna]]'' (1964) was the first of [[Russ Meyer]]'s films where the main female part, played in this film by [[Lorna Maitland]], was selected on the basis of her large [[breast]] size]]\n\nThe inclusion in film of any form of sexuality has been controversial since the development of the medium. [[Kiss#Kissing in films|Kissing in films]], for example, was initially considered by some to be scandalous. ''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]]'' (1896) contained a kiss, which was regarded as a sex scene and drew general outrage from movie goers, civic leaders, and religious leaders, as utterly shocking, [[obscenity|obscene]] and completely immoral. One contemporary critic wrote, \"The spectacle of the prolonged pasturing on each other's lips was beastly enough in life size on the stage but magnified to gargantuan proportions and repeated three times over it is absolutely disgusting.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xq5FAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA239 The Chap-book, Volume 5, Number 5, July 15, 1896 ]</ref> The Catholic Church called for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution.<ref name=sexinfilms1>[http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms1.html Sex in Cinema: Pre-1920s]</ref> Perhaps in defiance of the righteous indignation and \"to spice up a film\", the film was followed by many kiss imitators, including ''[[The Kiss in the Tunnel]]'' (1899) and ''The Kiss'' (1900). Other producers would take the criticism on board, or in mock of the standard, and use an implicit kiss, which would be obstructed from view just as the lips would touch, such as shielding a possible kiss by placing say a hat in front of the actors' faces, or fading to grey just as a kiss is to take place, etc.\n\nThe display of cleavage created controversy. For example, producer [[Howard Hughes]] displayed [[Jane Russell]]'s cleavage in ''[[The Outlaw]]'' (1943) and in ''[[The French Line]]'' (1953), which was found objectionable under the [[Hays Code]] because of Russell's \"breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure\" while some of her [[decollete]] gowns were regarded to be \"intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Doherty, Thomas |author2=Doherty, Thomas Patrick |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007 |title=Hollywood's censor: Joseph I.

Producers such as [[Russ Meyer]] produced films which featured actresses with large breasts. ''[[Lorna (film)|Lorna]]'' (1964) was the first of his films where the main female part, played by [[Lorna Maitland]], was selected on the basis of breast size. The producers and exhibitors of the film were prosecuted for obscenity in several US states. Other large breasted actresses used by Meyer include [[Kitten Natividad]], [[Erica Gavin]], [[Tura Satana]], and [[Uschi Digard]] among many others. The majority of them were naturally large breasted and he occasionally cast women in their first trimesters of pregnancy to enhance their breast size even further.<ref name=russmeyer>{{cite book |last1=Meyer |first1=Russ |others=(Under the pseudonym \"Adolph Albion Schwartz\") |year=2000 | title=''A Clean Breast: The Life and Loves of Russ Meyer'' (3 volume set) |publisher=Hauck Pub Co |location=El Rio, TX |isbn=0-9621797-2-8}}</ref> Author and director [[William Rotsler]] said: \"with ''Lorna'' Meyer established the formula that made him rich and famous, the formula of people filmed at top hate, top lust, top heavy.\"<ref>{{cite book|author= McDonough, Jimmy|year=2005| title=''Big bosoms and square jaws : the biography of Russ Meyer, king of the sex film'' | publisher=Jonathan Cape | location=London | isbn=0-224-07250-1}}, p.138</ref>\n\n''[[Blue Movie]]'' (1969), directed by [[Andy Warhol]],<ref name=\"NYT-19690722\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Movie Review - Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-19690810\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie.

Comedy films, especially romantic comedies and romantic dramas, tend toward character interaction.\n\nMystery films, thrillers, drama and horror films tend toward strong plots and premises, such as ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (1972), ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'' (1980), ''[[Body Heat]]'' (1981), ''[[Nine 1/2 Weeks]]'' (1986), ''[[Angel Heart]]'' (1987), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Single White Female]]'' (1992), ''[[Color of Night]]'' (1994), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), ''[[Leaving Las Vegas]]'' (1995), ''[[Total Eclipse (film)|Total Eclipse]]'' (1995), ''[[Different Strokes (film)|Different Strokes]]'' (1997), ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]'' (1998), ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' (1999) and ''[[In the Cut]]'' (2003).<ref name=\"CB1\" /> Others, like ''[[About Last Night...]]'' (1986), ''[[Monster's Ball]]'' (2001), ''[[Chloe (film)|Chloe]]'' (2009), ''[[Love & Other Drugs]]'' (2010), ''[[Blue Valentine (film)|Blue Valentine]]'' (2010), ''[[Shame (2011 film)|Shame]]'' (2011), ''[[Compliance (film)|Compliance]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Sessions (film)|The Sessions]]'' (2012) combine both strong plots and characters.<ref name=\"CB1\">{{cite web|last=Lundin |first=Leigh |url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=13152 |title=Erotic Mystery Thrillers |work=Sex-n-violence |publisher=Criminal Brief |date=2010-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100324/REVIEWS/100329990/1023 |title=Chloe|publisher=Rogerebert.com |date=March 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Thrillers====\n[[Erotic thriller]]s are a popular American erotic subgenre, with films such as ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'' (1980), ''[[Angel Heart]]'' (1987), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Single White Female]]'' (1992), ''[[Color of Night]]'' (1994), ''[[The Maddening]]'' (1995), ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]'' (1998), ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' (1999), ''[[In the Cut]]'' (2003), ''[[Chloe (film)|Chloe]]'' (2009), ''[[Compliance (film)|Compliance]]'' (2012), and ''[[The Boy Next Door (film)|The Boy Next Door]]'' (2015).<ref name=\"CB1\"/> In some films, the development of a sexual relationship (or even a [[one-night stand]]) is often used to create tension in the storyline, especially if the people involved should not be sleeping together, such as in ''[[Out of Sight]]'' (1998), where a [[U.S. Marshal]] has sex with the criminal she is pursuing.\n\n====Horror====\nIn [[horror film]]s, sex is often used to ''mark'' characters that are doomed to die. Characters that engage in sex acts are often the first to be claimed by the antagonist(s), or will die shortly after their sex scene or (sometimes) in the middle of it. This convention of it being bad luck to have sex in a horror film is notably illustrated in the ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' film series, where supernatural villain [[Jason Voorhees]] takes a special dislike to teenagers and young adults having sex because, as a young boy, he drowned in a lake while the camp counselors who should have been supervising him were having sex.\n\nIn some interpretations of this \"rule\", the sex acts themselves directly cause the character's demise. In ''[[Cabin Fever (2002 film)|Cabin Fever]]'', a man catches the deadly illness because a woman who was infected (but not yet symptomatic) seduces and has impulsive sex with him. They don't use a [[condom]] because the careless woman believes she is healthy. Ironically, the woman (and the audience) only realize that she is infected because of red welts that are brought out by their rough lovemaking. ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' (1995) and its sequels also feature many sexual deaths as virtually every human who mates with an alien in the franchise subsequently dies - female aliens kill human suitors regardless of whether they have poor genes, resist the alien's advances, or mate successfully. Human women who mate with alien men die shortly after sex as their abdomens burst during the unnaturally rapid pregnancy that always follows.\n\nMost times in horror movies the [[final girl|typical survivor]] is a young girl who is still a virgin. In the film ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'', which satirizes horror movies, this rule is somewhat broken as the character [[List of Scream (film series) characters|Randy Meeks]] points out that one of the rules of horrors is to not have sex. In an intersecting scene, the film's main [[protagonist]] [[Sidney Prescott]] loses her virginity to Billy Loomis. After they finish, Billy is stabbed by [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] and Sidney is then chased. Randy himself survives a gunshot wound at the end of the film because, as he explains, he is a virgin. However, he dies in the sequel, ''[[Scream 2]]'', after which it is revealed that he lost his virginity sometime prior to his death.\n\n==Mexican==\nIn Mexico, many comedy films are based on sex, typically portraying men as unstoppable sex-seeking creatures and women as willing targets. Although the number of such comedies waned during the 1990s, domestic servants, bar workers, dancers and neighbors' wives continue to be depicted as potentially willing sexual partners.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The films ''[[La Tarea]]'' (1991), ''[[Miracle Alley]]'' (1995) and ''[[Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n]]'' (2001) are some of the most important examples of this.{{According to whom|date=May 2017}}\n\n==India==\nThe [[Cinema of India|entertainment industry]] is an important part of modern India, and is expressive of [[India#Society|Indian society]] in general. Historically, [[Indian television]] and film has lacked the frank depiction of sex.

Because of the same process of glamorization of film entertainment that occurs in [[Hollywood]], Indian cinema, mainly the Hindi-speaking Bollywood industry, is also beginning to add sexual overtones.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-others/indians-mature-enough-to-handle-sex-in-films-konkona-sen/|title=Indians mature enough to handle sex in films: Konkona Sen|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|date=December 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Television==\n{{Update|section|date=October 2015}}\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=October 2015}}\nMany [[dramatic programming|drama series]], and daytime [[soap opera]]s are based around sex. This commonly revolves around the development of personal relationships of the main characters, with a view of creating [[sexual tension]] in the series.\n\nPartial nudity was considered acceptable on daytime television in the 1970s but disappeared after 2000, partly due to more conservative morals,<ref name=\"HR1\">{{cite web|last=Siegel |first=Tatiana |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002276018 |title=Erotic thrillers lose steam on big screen|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|location=Hollywood |date=2006-04-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722010019/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002276018 |archivedate=2010-07-22}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2019}} and also to the prevalence of cable and satellite subscriptions. Only [[PBS]] occasionally features nudity.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, the French TV channel [[Canal+]] featured a series titled ''[[X Femmes]]'' (English: ''X Women''), which consisted of ten short films shot by female directors with the goal of producing erotica from a female point of view.\n\n== Same-sex scenes in mainstream cinema ==\nSince approximately 2010, many mainstream films have shown sexual scenes [[Lesbian sexual practices|between lesbian couples]]. There have been various films which have been made which mainly focus on exploring the relationship between [[lesbian]] women. Because of the limited films featuring same-sex sex scenes before 2010s, researchers were unable to research people's views on the intimate scenes between lesbians. In 2016, researchers Maria T. Soto-Sanfiel and Adriana Ibiti created a report on pleasurable sensations created by watching sexual scenes between lesbian couples. People, including [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] individuals, reported that the scenes had different effects on their [[sexual arousal]]. The reasons were different for everyone who identified themselves as either heterosexual or [[Homosexuality|homosexual]], male or female. Lesbian women said that it brought back memories of their own experience and created pleasurable sensations while watching it.<ref name=\"soto-sanfiel\">{{Cite journal|last=Soto-Sanfiel|first=Mar\u00eda T.|last2=Ibiti|first2=Adriana|date=2016-03-10|title=Lesbian Sex in Mainstream Cinema and Audience Enjoyment|journal=Sexuality & Culture|volume=20|issue=3|pages=555\u2013578|doi=10.1007/s12119-016-9342-5|issn=1095-5143}}</ref> Heterosexual women said that they got the same pleasurable sensations as watching heterosexual sex scenes. Heterosexual men related the scenes to their memories of pornography. Gay men preferred seeing heterosexual scenes because they could imagine themselves in place of the women.\n\nFrench film ''[[La vie d'Ad\u00e8le]]'' (''Blue Is the Warmest Color'', in English), directed by [[Abdellatif Kechiche]], was released in October 2013. The film is about a high school student Adele who lusts after art student Lea and falls in love with her. The film explores the lesbian relationship between them and their transformation as characters. To showcase their developing characters, the three-hour long film contained almost ten minutes of sexual scenes between them. These scenes were so long that even heterosexual scenes in movies have not exceeded the length. The scenes were shot in a close-up manner, showing great detail with bold and intimate camera angles.<ref name=\"soto-sanfiel\" /> Many critics said that if it was not a film, the sex scenes would be close to [[pornography]]. The sex scenes were controversial and received mixed reviews. France set the age limit to 12 years, Singapore 21 years, and Brazil opposed to print [[Blu-ray|blu-rays]]. The movie earned around $20 million in US and Europe. It was shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and won the highest award, [[Palme d'Or]]. It also won many international awards around the world. A film [[Carol (film)|Carol]], directed by [[Todd Haynes]], was released in November 2015, also caught a lot of attention. The movie was about a young woman named Therese Belivet (played by [[Rooney Mara]]), who falls in love with an older women named Carol Aird (played by [[Cate Blanchett]]). It's set during  Christmas, 1952, and Therese is working at the Manhattan upscale department store, where she meets Carol who is buying toys for her daughter. Carol intentionally forgets her gloves, and invites Therese for lunch. Therese goes to Carol's house and finds out about her difficulties where her husband is trying to get a divorce. Carol's husband Harge (played by [[Kyle Chandler]]) accidentally sees Carol with Therese while he was picking up their daughter to take her to France. If proof about Carol's homosexuality is found, Harge can convict her and take full custody of their daughter and restrict her from visiting her. Harge hires an investigator to prove Carol's homosexuality. On the [[New Year's Eve]], Carol and Therese have sex for the first time. Later, they found out that they were being recorded and the evidence was already sent to Harge. Therefore, Carol requests Harge to keep their daughter in custody but let her visit her. Carol and Theresa finally unite at the end. The movie included 3 minutes of sex scenes between Carol and Theresa. The sex scenes are carefully shot with the actors shown half nude, and it does not contain explicit scenes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/cate-blanchett-carol-cannes-review-796213|title='Carol': Cannes Review|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref> Haynes while talking about the production of the sex scenes said that actors pretend that they are not nervous, but he added that: \"But they are.

But, this has changed greatly and many movies about same-sex relationships have been made.\n\nIn addition to an increasing focus on relationships between lesbians in film, but there are also many recent movies that focus on gay male relationships as well. An Italian movie [[Call Me by Your Name (film)|Call me by your name]], directed by [[Luca Guadagnino]], was released on January 2017. The film is about a 17-year-old American-Jewish, named Elio (played by [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet|Timothee Chalamet]]) forming a relationship with a 24-year old graduate student Oliver.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/04/call-me-by-your-name-an-erotic-triumph|title=\"Call Me by Your Name\": An Erotic Triumph|last=Lane|first=Anthony|date=2017-11-24|access-date=2019-12-02|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> The movie is set in the summer of 1983, where Elio is a son of archaeology Professor, Professor Perlmann. Professor Perlmann invites his annual assistant for the year, Oliver, who will live with them during this time. Elio does not have much interest in Oliver in the beginning. During the summer, Elio  reads books, listens to music, or stays with his girlfriend, Marzia. Oliver tries to annoy Elio by telling him that he has a crush on a local girl. Elio tries to annoy Oliver by starting a sexual relationship with his girlfriend Marzia. But, soon, Elio starts getting attracted to Oliver. Elio asks to have a relationship with Oliver, but Oliver does not agree initially. But, later that day, they kiss. After Elio insists on meeting him, Oliver agrees, and meets him at midnight where they both have sex. As their relationship progresses, they keep getting more closer to each other physically and emotionally, and they have sex multiple times while keeping their relationship secret. It also becomes clear that Elio's parents knew about their relationship. Before Oliver leaves, Elio's parents recommend they go to Bergamo. Later, after Oliver leaves, Elio is sad and his father talks about how he was also in this same type of relationship before. He ask him to stay strong and learn from it. At the end, Oliver calls Elio's parents telling them he is engaged to be married. The movie ends with Elio's being sad and in sorrow. The sex scenes included showed the actors half naked and the scenes were short.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film|Human sexuality|Erotica and pornography}}\n* [[Erotic thriller]]\n* [[Golden Age of Porn]]\n* [[Nudity in film]]\n* [[Pre-Code sex films]]\n* [[Sex symbol]]\n* \n* \n* \n* [[Unsimulated sex]]\n* [[Sexposition]]\n* [[Kiss#Kissing in films|Kissing in films]]\n* [[Media and gender]]\n* [[Exploitation of women in mass media]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Andrews, David (2006) ''Soft in the Middle: the contemporary softcore feature in its contexts''.

Many of the earliest [[Westerns on television|Westerns]] were targeted at a children's audience, stemming back to when children's radio serials often were set in a Western setting. ''[[Ding Dong School]]'', which aired from 1952 to 1965, was one of the first attempts to produce educational programming for very young children; its creator and host, [[Frances Horwich]], would sit in front of the camera and simulate small talk with the viewing audience at home, demonstrating basic skills for the camera. Later shows for very young children include ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[The Electric Company]]'', and ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]''.\n\n====Role of advertising====\nIn the United States, early children's television was often a marketing branch of a larger corporate product and it rarely contained any educational elements (for instance, ''[[The Magic Clown]]'', a popular early children's program, was primarily an advertisement for Bonomo's [[Turkish taffy]] product).\n\nThis practice continued, albeit in a much toned-down manner, through the 1980s in the United States, when the [[Federal Communications Commission]] prohibited tie-in advertising on broadcast television. These regulations do not apply to cable, which is out of the reach of the FCC's content regulations.\n\nThe effect of [[Advertising to children#How Children react to TV advertisement|advertising to children]] remains heavily debated and extensively studied.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hardman|first1=Jeremy|title=Advertising to Children: According to a new report, children are far from vulnerable when it comes to advertising|journal=Admap|date=1998|url=http://www.warc.com./Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=8d0fd247-8c85-4374-9e76-975c2d9f7966&q=advertising+to+kids&CID=A5823&PUB=ADMAP}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carruthers|first1=Brian|title=Television vs digital: the battle for children's (and mums') attention|journal=Event Reports: MRS Kids and Youth Research Conference|date=2016|url=http://www.warc.com/Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=13f66892-57c8-4497-9257-9a1eb23b93b7&q=advertising+to+children&CID=A106706&PUB=EVENT-REPORTS}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Marvin|last2=Gorn|first2=Gerald|title=Some Unintended Consequences of TV Advertising to Children|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=1978|volume=5|issue=1|page=22|doi=10.1086/208710}}</ref> <ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan|first1=Tom|title=Principles of advertising & IMC|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0072537741|edition=2nd ed., international|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofadve0000dunc}}</ref>\n\nLater non-educational children's [[television program]]s included the [[science fiction]] programmes of [[Irwin Allen]] (most notably ''[[Lost in Space]]''{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}), the fantasy series of [[Sid and Marty Krofft]], the extensive cartoon empire of [[Hanna-Barbera Productions|Hanna-Barbera]] and the numerous sitcoms that aired as part of [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] in the 1990s, many of these programs fit a broader description of [[family-friendly]] television, targeting a broad demographic that includes adults without excluding children.\n\nCommercial free children television debuted with ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on the Public Broadcasting Service [[PBS]] in the United States November 1969, produced by what is today the [[Sesame Workshop]].\n\n====Saturday morning cartoon blocks====\n{{main article|Saturday morning cartoon}}\nIn the United States, Saturday mornings were generally scheduled with cartoon from the 1960s to 1980s as viewership with that programming would pull in 20 million watchers which dropped to 2 million in 2003.

Infomercials replaced the cartoon on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 2008.<ref name=wp/>\n\nThe Saturday cartoons were less of a draw due to the various cable cartoon channels ([[Nickelodeon]], [[Disney Channel]] and [[Cartoon Network]], etc.) being available all week starting in the 1990s. Recordable options became more prevalent in the 1990s with [[Videocassette recorder]] and then its 21st-century replacements of DVDs, DVRs and streaming services. FCC rule changes in the 1990s regarding the E/I programming and limitation on kid-focus advertising made the cartoons less profitable. Another possible contributor is the rising divorce rate and the following children's visitation pushed more \"quality time\" with the kids instead of TV watching.<ref name=wp/>\n\nOn September 27, 2014, the last traditional Saturday network morning cartoon block, ''[[Vortexx]]'', ended and was replaced the following week by the syndicated ''[[One Magnificent Morning]]'' on [[The CW]].<ref name=wp/>\n\n====Demographics====\nChildren's television series can target a wide variety of [[key demographic]]s; the programming used to target these demographics varies by age and gender. Few television networks target infants and toddlers under two years of age, in part due to widespread opposition to the practice. Children's programming can be targeted toward persons 2 to 11 years of age;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-18/nickelodeon-retakes-kids-ratings-crown-with-paw-patrol-|title=Nickelodeon Retakes Kids\u2019 Ratings Crown With \u2018Paw Patrol\u2019|date=18 December 2013|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> in practice, this is further divided into the ''preschool'' demographic (2 to 6 years old) and the older children or ''preteen/tween'' demographic (6 to 11 years old).\n\nPreschool-oriented programming is generally more overtly educational. In a number of cases, such shows are produced in consultation with educators and child psychologists in an effort to teach [[age-appropriate]] lessons (the series ''[[Sesame Street]]'' pioneered this approach when it debuted in 1969).<ref name=\"truglio-234\">{{cite book | last = Fisch | first = Shalom M. | author2 = Rosemarie T.

A format that has increased in popularity since the 1990s (see, for example, ''[[Blue's Clues]]'', ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'') is the \"pseudo-interactive\" program, in which the action of the show stops and breaks the [[fourth wall]] to give a young viewer the opportunity to answer a question or dilemma put forth on the show, with the action continuing as if the viewer answered correctly.\n\nShows that target the demographic of persons 6 to 11 years old focus primarily on entertainment and can range from comedic cartoons (with an emphasis on [[slapstick]]) to action series. Most children's television series targeting this age range are animated (with a few exceptions, perhaps the best-known being the long-running ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise), and many often specifically target boys (especially in the case of action series), girls or sometimes both. Efforts to create educational programming for this demographic have had a mixed record of success; although such series made up the bulk of educational programming on broadcast television in the first decade of the 2000s, they also tend to have very low viewership. [[PBS]] had somewhat greater success with its now defunct educational programming block, [[PBS Kids GO!]], that targets this demographic.\n\nThe teen demographic targets viewers 11 to 17 years of age. Live-action series that target this demographic are more dramatic and developed, including [[teen drama]]s and [[teen sitcom]]s. In some cases, they may contain more mature content that is usually not permissible on shows targeting younger viewers, and can include some profanity or suggestive dialogue. Animated programming is not generally targeted at this demographic; cartoons that are aimed at teenagers generally feature more [[crude humor]] than those oriented toward younger children. Educational programming targeted at this demographic has historically been rare, other than on [[NASA TV]]'s education block; this has somewhat changed with [[Litton Entertainment]]'s entry into educational television in the early 2010s, as Litton's programs exploited a loophole in U.S. regulations that allows teen-oriented programs to be counted as educational but not be subject to restrictions on advertising for children's programs. However, some programming aimed at the demographic has had some tangenital educational value in regards to social issues, such as the now-defunct [[T-NBC]] block of sitcoms, which often tackled issues such as underage drinking or drug use.\n\n====Gender targeting====\nA growing issue is the occurrence of gendered stereotypes within children's television. Certain demographics are assigned to different shows. Mainly, there are \"boy\" shows and \"girl\" shows that shows will try to aim their content towards. These shows will have mainly male characters as leads because statistics show that girls are more likely to watch boy shows than boys are to watch girl shows. As far as viewership is concerned, this means producers will make more from airing shows with leads that are male, so they have stuck with that formula, despite the changing times.\n\nIn a study titled \"Four-Year-Olds\u2019 Beliefs About How Others Regard Males and Females,\" researcher May Ling Halim observed how television viewing and interactions of parents within a household may affect a child's perception on gender. She had about 250 four-year-olds interviewed and she asked them questions about their parents, the opposite gender, how much TV they watched and about their feelings on their own gender. The study used four-year-olds because at age four, children are able to make distinctions concerning gender and concerning how two people may view the same thing in different ways. The results of the study showed that for the most part, children were shielded from society's gender hierarchy. Each seemed to favor their own gender which is typical of little kids. Household hierarchy as well as exposure to TV increased children's awareness of the gender hierarchies that are present in the adult world. Halim also observed how society's higher valuing of males could affect how children approach pathways to academics and occupations later in their lives.\n\nWhether the shows are from Nickelodeon or from the Disney Channel, there are many instances where boys and girls are cast in typical roles that are recognized widely by society and a large percentage of the world. While there are many studies that have been done exploring the topic of children's perceptions of gender through television, there are few pieces of concrete evidence that tell people that what children are watching is actually harmful to them.<ref>Meyer, Nicole. 2015.

All three also operate secondary services with specialized scopes drawing upon their respective libraries, such as a focus on specific demographics, or a focus upon classic programming that fall within their scope and demographics.\n* [[Nickelodeon]], the first children's television channel, launched in 1979 (though its history traces back to the 1977 launch of The Pinwheel Network);<ref>http://www.viacom.com/ourbrands/medianetworks/mtvnetworks/Pages/nickelodeon.aspx{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> it consists largely of original series aimed at children, pre-teens and young teenagers, including animated series, to live-action comedy and action series, as well as series aimed at preschoolers, and appeals to adult and adolescent audiences with a lineup of mainly live-action sitcom reruns and a limited amount of original programming on [[Nick at Nite]].\n** Nickelodeon operates four digital cable and satellite channels separate from the main service: [[Nick Jr.]], a channel devoted to preschool programming;  [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]], which primarily (although not exclusively) runs animated programming; [[NickMusic]], a pop [[music video]] service branded as \"[[MTV]] Hits\" prior to 2016; and a channel space that is split between teenager-oriented [[TeenNick]] during the day and 1990s-centered rerun service [[NickRewind]] at night. This is in addition to a flexible number of free digital channels under the Nickelodeon brand on parent company [[ViacomCBS]]'s over-the-top service [[Pluto TV]].\n* [[Cartoon Network]], launched in 1992, primarily broadcasts children's shows, mostly animated programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. It is primarily aimed at children and young teenagers between the ages of 7-16 and targets older teens and adults with mature content during its late night/overnight daypart [[Adult Swim]].\n** Cartoon Network also operates [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], a channel that specializes in programs centered around classic brands that parent company Time Warner owns, along with some imported programs.\n* [[Disney Channel]] launched in 1983 as a [[pay television|premium channel]]; it consists of original first-run television series, theatrically released and original made-for-cable movies and select other third-party programming. Disney Channel \u2013 which formerly operated as a premium service \u2013 originally marketed its programs towards families during the 1980s, and later at younger children by the 1990s, and primarily at [[Teenybopper]] females aged 13-16 between 2006 and 2017, before returning to families.\n** Disney Channel operates two digital channels separate from the main service: [[Disney Junior]], which launched in 2012 and primarily broadcasts animated series catered towards a preschool audience, and [[Disney XD]], which caters primarily to an older youth audience with an action-oriented focus. Disney Channel does not have an outlet for its archive programming. Disney also operates [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], a channel primarily carrying live-action programming catered towards a teenage/young adult audience. Although its [[Television networks preceding Freeform|previous incarnations]] under different owners had family-oriented formats and children's programming, they have since been phased out in favor of series such as [[teen drama]]s, some coming from Disney Channel.\n\nUnder current mandates, all [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television station]]s in the United States must show a minimum of three hours per week of [[E/I|educational children's programming]], regardless of format. Until 2019, this rule also applied to [[digital subchannels]]; as a result, digital multicast networks whose formats should not fit children's programming, such as [[Live Well Network]] and [[TheCoolTV]], were required to carry educational programs to fit the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] mandates. (The rule for digital subchannels was repealed in July 2019;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/07/fcc-vote-to-ease-kid-vid-rules-draws-pushback-and-democrats-dissent-1202644411/|title=FCC's Vote To Ease \"Kid Vid\" Rules Draws Pushback And Democrats' Dissent|last=Hayes|first=Dade|date=July 10, 2019|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/fcc-gives-broadcasters-more-kidvid-flexibility|title=FCC Gives Broadcasters More KidVid Flexibility|last=Eggerton|first=John|date=July 10, 2019|website=Broadcasting & Cable|language=en-us|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> in practice, most still carry educational programs anyway.) In 2017, there was a programming block that aired on syndication called [[KidsClick]]; it was notable as a concerted effort to program children's shows on television without regard to their educational content, one of the first such efforts since the E/I rule took effect. The transition to digital television has allowed for the debut of whole subchannels that air children's programming 24/7; examples include [[Universal Kids]], [[Qubo]], [[Discovery Family]] and [[Smile (TV network)|Smile]]. [[PBS]], the United States' main [[public television]] network, devotes over eight hours of its weekday schedule, and several hours of its weekend schedule, to educational children's programs, and the country's only directly nationally operated TV service for public consumption, [[NASA TV]], also includes educational programs in its schedule for use in schools.\n\n===Canada===\n\nEnglish-language children's specialty channels in Canada are primarily owned by [[Corus Entertainment]] and [[DHX Media]]. Corus operates [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]], [[Treehouse TV|Treehouse]], and [[Teletoon]], as well as localized versions of the [[Cartoon Network (Canada)|Cartoon Network]], [[Disney Channel (Canada)|Disney Channel]], [[Disney Junior (Canada)|Disney Junior]], [[Disney XD (Canada)|Disney XD]], and [[Nickelodeon (Canada)|Nickelodeon]] brands. DHX operates [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]], as well as the spin-off services [[Chrgd]] and [[Family Jr.]] [[BBC Kids]] was the only English-language children's television channel in Canada that is not owned by Corus or DHX; since 2011 to its close in December 2018, it has been majority owned and operated by British Columbia's public broadcaster [[Knowledge Network]].\n\nIn [[French language|French]], Corus operates [[T\u00e9l\u00e9toon]] and [[La cha\u00eene Disney]], DHX operates [[T\u00e9l\u00e9magino]] (a French version of Family Jr.), [[TVA Group]] operates the preschool-oriented [[Yoopa]], and [[Bell Media]] runs the teen-oriented [[Vrak]].  Via its majority-owned subsidiary [[Telelatino]], Corus also operates two children and family-oriented networks in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], [[TeleNi\u00f1os]] and [[Telebimbi]] respectively.\n\nOn broadcast television and satellite to cable undertakings, children's television content is relegated to the country's public and designated provincial educational broadcasters, including [[CBC Television]] and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]], as well as [[City Saskatchewan]], [[CTV Two Alberta]] (formerly Access), [[Knowledge Network]], [[T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec]], [[TFO]], and [[TVOntario]] ([[TVOKids]].\n\nAided by the cultural similarities between Canada and the United States, along with film credits and subsidies available from the Canadian government, a large number of animated children's series have been made in Canada with the intention of exporting them to the United States. Such programs carry [[:File:Canada wordmark.svg|a prominent Government of Canada wordmark]] in their closing credits.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe [[BBC]] and [[ITV plc]] both operate children's oriented television networks on digital terrestrial television: the BBC runs [[CBBC]] as well as the preschool-oriented [[CBeebies]], while ITV runs [[CITV]]. Both channels were spun off from children's television strands on their respective flagship channels ([[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], and [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]). BBC and ITV have largely phased out children's programming from their main channels in order to focus on the dedicated services; in 2012, as part of the \"Delivering Quality First\" initiative, the BBC announced that it would end the broadcast of CBBC programmes on BBC One following the completion of the transition to digital terrestrial television, citing low viewership in comparison to broadcasts of the programmes on the CBBC channel.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18083178|title=Children's shows to leave BBC One|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 May 2012 | date=16 May 2012}}</ref> [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] also broadcasts a preschool-oriented block known as ''[[Milkshake!]]'', while its owner, [[Viacom International Media Networks Europe]], also runs versions of [[Nickelodeon UK|Nickelodeon]] and its sister networks [[Nicktoons (UK and Ireland)|Nicktoons]] and [[Nick Jr. (UK and Ireland)|Nick Jr.]]\n\n[[Sony Pictures Television]]-owned [[Pop (UK and Ireland)|Pop]], which formerly operated as a pay television channel, launched on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] on 20 March 2014.

Since 1998 [[RT\u00c92]] has provided children's programming from 07:00 to 17:30 each weekday, original titled [[The Den (Ireland)|The Den]], the service was renamed [[TRT\u00c9]] and RT\u00c9jr in 2010. Irish Language service [[TG4]] provide two strands of Children's programming C\u00fala 4 Na n\u00d3g and [[C\u00fala 4]] during the day. Commercial broadcaster [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] broadcast a children's strand called ''Gimme 3'' from 1998 - 1999. And Broadcast a new strand called [[3Kids]]\n\n===Australia===\nChildren's channels that exist in Australia are [[ABC Me]], [[ABC Kids (Australia)|ABC Kids]], [[KidsCo]], [[Disney Channel (Australia)|Disney Channel]] and its spin-off [[Disney Junior (Australia and New Zealand)|Disney Junior]], [[CBeebies]], [[Nickelodeon (Australia)|Nickelodeon]] and its spin-off [[Nick Jr. (Australia)|Nick Jr.]], and [[Cartoon Network (Australia)|Cartoon Network]] and its spin-off [[Boomerang (Australian TV channel)|Boomerang]].\n\n===Japan===\nChildren's channels that exist in Japan are [[NHK Educational TV]], [[Kids Station]], [[Disney XD (Japan)|Disney XD]], [[Nickelodeon (Japan)|Nickelodeon]] (now under a block on [[Animax]], known as \"Nick Time\") and [[Cartoon Network Japan|Cartoon Network]] (Cartoon Network's age demographic is moving towards older viewers with shows such as ''[[Regular Show]]'' and ''[[Adventure Time]]'').\n\n===Iceland===\nOne of the most well-known children's TV programs comes from Iceland, [[LazyTown]], was created by [[Magn\u00fas Scheving|Magnus Scheving]], European Gymnastics Champion and CEO of [[Lazytown Entertainment|LazyTown Entertainment]]. The show has aired in over 180 countries, been dubbed into more than 32 languages and is the most expensive children's show of all time.\n\n===India===\n{{Main articles|Category:Children%27s_television_channels_in_India}}\n[[Cartoon Network]] was the first channel for children launched in India in 1995. Subsequently, Disney and [[Nickelodeon]] Channel arrived. [[Hungama TV]] (2004) was first channel for kids that had local content. [[Pogo (TV channel)|Pogo]] and [[BabyTV]] came later by 2006. By 2018, 23 channels were aired in India.\n\n===Romania===\n[[Nickelodeon (Central & Eastern Europe)|Nickelodeon]] was the first children's channel in Romania, launched in December 1998. Afterwards, [[Minimax]] became the first Romanian children's channel to air locally produced content, launched on [[Children's Day]] in 2001.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20050217093201/http://www.minimaxtv.ro/min20.php?&l=1</ref> Since then, channels like [[BabyTV]] and [[Disney Channel (Romanian TV channel)|Disney Channel]] have arrived.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of local children's television series (United States)]]\n* [[Saturday-morning cartoon]] for an in-depth history of children's television in the United States\n* [[Advertising to children]]\n* [[List of children's television series by country]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tours/childrens/tourchildrens1.html Children's Television], online exhibition from [[screenonline]], a website of the [[British Film Institute]]\n* [http://www.pophistorynow.com The 1950s\u20132000s Week-By-Week - includes listings and factoids for local/national children's shows.]\n* [http://www.lasarletter.net/drupal/node/14 The future of children's digital television - an interview with Gloria Tristani]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Children's Television Series}}\n[[Category:Children's television series| ]]\n[[Category:Television by interest]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n[[Category:Children's television|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|educational television|instructional television|non-commercial educational}}\n'''Children's television series''' are television programs designed for and marketed to [[kindergarteners]], [[preschooler]]s, and [[toddler]]s normally scheduled for broadcast during the morning and afternoon when children are awake.

In the US in the early 1930s, adventure serials such as ''[[Little Orphan Annie (radio)|Little Orphan Annie]]'' began to emerge, becoming a staple of children's afternoon radio listening.<ref name=\"britannica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Little-Orphan-Annie-radio-program|publisher=britannica.com|title=Little Orphan Annie &#124; radio program &#124; Britannica.com|accessdate=January 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===History in the United States===\n[[File:Bert and Ernie (2841396233).jpg|thumb|right|240px|Bert and Ernie from ''[[Sesame Street]]'']]\nEarly children's shows included ''[[Kukla, Fran and Ollie]]'' (1947), ''[[Howdy Doody]]'', and ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]''. Many of the earliest [[Westerns on television|Westerns]] were targeted at a children's audience, stemming back to when children's radio serials often were set in a Western setting. ''[[Ding Dong School]]'', which aired from 1952 to 1965, was one of the first attempts to produce educational programming for very young children; its creator and host, [[Frances Horwich]], would sit in front of the camera and simulate small talk with the viewing audience at home, demonstrating basic skills for the camera. Later shows for very young children include ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[The Electric Company]]'', and ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]''.\n\n====Role of advertising====\nIn the United States, early children's television was often a marketing branch of a larger corporate product and it rarely contained any educational elements (for instance, ''[[The Magic Clown]]'', a popular early children's program, was primarily an advertisement for Bonomo's [[Turkish taffy]] product).\n\nThis practice continued, albeit in a much toned-down manner, through the 1980s in the United States, when the [[Federal Communications Commission]] prohibited tie-in advertising on broadcast television. These regulations do not apply to cable, which is out of the reach of the FCC's content regulations.\n\nThe effect of [[Advertising to children#How Children react to TV advertisement|advertising to children]] remains heavily debated and extensively studied.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hardman|first1=Jeremy|title=Advertising to Children: According to a new report, children are far from vulnerable when it comes to advertising|journal=Admap|date=1998|url=http://www.warc.com./Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=8d0fd247-8c85-4374-9e76-975c2d9f7966&q=advertising+to+kids&CID=A5823&PUB=ADMAP}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carruthers|first1=Brian|title=Television vs digital: the battle for children's (and mums') attention|journal=Event Reports: MRS Kids and Youth Research Conference|date=2016|url=http://www.warc.com/Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=13f66892-57c8-4497-9257-9a1eb23b93b7&q=advertising+to+children&CID=A106706&PUB=EVENT-REPORTS}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Marvin|last2=Gorn|first2=Gerald|title=Some Unintended Consequences of TV Advertising to Children|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=1978|volume=5|issue=1|page=22|doi=10.1086/208710}}</ref> <ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan|first1=Tom|title=Principles of advertising & IMC|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0072537741|edition=2nd ed., international|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofadve0000dunc}}</ref>\n\nLater non-educational children's [[television program]]s included the [[science fiction]] programmes of [[Irwin Allen]] (most notably ''[[Lost in Space]]''{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}), the fantasy series of [[Sid and Marty Krofft]], the extensive cartoon empire of [[Hanna-Barbera Productions|Hanna-Barbera]] and the numerous sitcoms that aired as part of [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] in the 1990s, many of these programs fit a broader description of [[family-friendly]] television, targeting a broad demographic that includes adults without excluding children.\n\nCommercial free children television debuted with ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on the Public Broadcasting Service [[PBS]] in the United States November 1969, produced by what is today the [[Sesame Workshop]].\n\n====Saturday morning cartoon blocks====\n{{main article|Saturday morning cartoon}}\nIn the United States, Saturday mornings were generally scheduled with cartoon from the 1960s to 1980s as viewership with that programming would pull in 20 million watchers which dropped to 2 million in 2003. In 1992, teen comedies and a \"Today\" show weekend edition were first to displace the cartoon blocks on NBC.<ref name=wp>{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Gail|title=Saturday morning cartoons are no more|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/30/saturday-morning-cartoons-are-no-more/|accessdate=October 2, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=September 30, 2014}}</ref> Starting in September 2002, the networks turned to their affiliated cable cartoon channels or outside programmers for their blocks.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Paula|title=Kid skeds tread on joint strategy|url=https://variety.com/2002/tv/news/kid-skeds-tread-on-joint-strategy-1117873477/|accessdate=October 2, 2014|work=Variety|date=September 29, 2002}}</ref> The other two [[Big Three television networks]] soon did the same. Infomercials replaced the cartoon on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 2008.<ref name=wp/>\n\nThe Saturday cartoons were less of a draw due to the various cable cartoon channels ([[Nickelodeon]], [[Disney Channel]] and [[Cartoon Network]], etc.) being available all week starting in the 1990s. Recordable options became more prevalent in the 1990s with [[Videocassette recorder]] and then its 21st-century replacements of DVDs, DVRs and streaming services. FCC rule changes in the 1990s regarding the E/I programming and limitation on kid-focus advertising made the cartoons less profitable. Another possible contributor is the rising divorce rate and the following children's visitation pushed more \"quality time\" with the kids instead of TV watching.<ref name=wp/>\n\nOn September 27, 2014, the last traditional Saturday network morning cartoon block, ''[[Vortexx]]'', ended and was replaced the following week by the syndicated ''[[One Magnificent Morning]]'' on [[The CW]].<ref name=wp/>\n\n====Demographics====\nChildren's television series can target a wide variety of [[key demographic]]s; the programming used to target these demographics varies by age and gender. Few television networks target infants and toddlers under two years of age, in part due to widespread opposition to the practice. Children's programming can be targeted toward persons 2 to 11 years of age;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-18/nickelodeon-retakes-kids-ratings-crown-with-paw-patrol-|title=Nickelodeon Retakes Kids\u2019 Ratings Crown With \u2018Paw Patrol\u2019|date=18 December 2013|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> in practice, this is further divided into the ''preschool'' demographic (2 to 6 years old) and the older children or ''preteen/tween'' demographic (6 to 11 years old).\n\nPreschool-oriented programming is generally more overtly educational. In a number of cases, such shows are produced in consultation with educators and child psychologists in an effort to teach [[age-appropriate]] lessons (the series ''[[Sesame Street]]'' pioneered this approach when it debuted in 1969).<ref name=\"truglio-234\">{{cite book | last = Fisch | first = Shalom M. | author2 = Rosemarie T.

A format that has increased in popularity since the 1990s (see, for example, ''[[Blue's Clues]]'', ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'') is the \"pseudo-interactive\" program, in which the action of the show stops and breaks the [[fourth wall]] to give a young viewer the opportunity to answer a question or dilemma put forth on the show, with the action continuing as if the viewer answered correctly.\n\nShows that target the demographic of persons 6 to 11 years old focus primarily on entertainment and can range from comedic cartoons (with an emphasis on [[slapstick]]) to action series. Most children's television series targeting this age range are animated (with a few exceptions, perhaps the best-known being the long-running ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise), and many often specifically target boys (especially in the case of action series), girls or sometimes both. Efforts to create educational programming for this demographic have had a mixed record of success; although such series made up the bulk of educational programming on broadcast television in the first decade of the 2000s, they also tend to have very low viewership. [[PBS]] had somewhat greater success with its now defunct educational programming block, [[PBS Kids GO!]], that targets this demographic.\n\nThe teen demographic targets viewers 11 to 17 years of age. Live-action series that target this demographic are more dramatic and developed, including [[teen drama]]s and [[teen sitcom]]s. In some cases, they may contain more mature content that is usually not permissible on shows targeting younger viewers, and can include some profanity or suggestive dialogue. Animated programming is not generally targeted at this demographic; cartoons that are aimed at teenagers generally feature more [[crude humor]] than those oriented toward younger children. Educational programming targeted at this demographic has historically been rare, other than on [[NASA TV]]'s education block; this has somewhat changed with [[Litton Entertainment]]'s entry into educational television in the early 2010s, as Litton's programs exploited a loophole in U.S. regulations that allows teen-oriented programs to be counted as educational but not be subject to restrictions on advertising for children's programs. However, some programming aimed at the demographic has had some tangenital educational value in regards to social issues, such as the now-defunct [[T-NBC]] block of sitcoms, which often tackled issues such as underage drinking or drug use.\n\n====Gender targeting====\nA growing issue is the occurrence of gendered stereotypes within children's television. Certain demographics are assigned to different shows. Mainly, there are \"boy\" shows and \"girl\" shows that shows will try to aim their content towards. These shows will have mainly male characters as leads because statistics show that girls are more likely to watch boy shows than boys are to watch girl shows. As far as viewership is concerned, this means producers will make more from airing shows with leads that are male, so they have stuck with that formula, despite the changing times.\n\nIn a study titled \"Four-Year-Olds\u2019 Beliefs About How Others Regard Males and Females,\" researcher May Ling Halim observed how television viewing and interactions of parents within a household may affect a child's perception on gender. She had about 250 four-year-olds interviewed and she asked them questions about their parents, the opposite gender, how much TV they watched and about their feelings on their own gender. The study used four-year-olds because at age four, children are able to make distinctions concerning gender and concerning how two people may view the same thing in different ways. The results of the study showed that for the most part, children were shielded from society's gender hierarchy. Each seemed to favor their own gender which is typical of little kids. Household hierarchy as well as exposure to TV increased children's awareness of the gender hierarchies that are present in the adult world. Halim also observed how society's higher valuing of males could affect how children approach pathways to academics and occupations later in their lives.\n\nWhether the shows are from Nickelodeon or from the Disney Channel, there are many instances where boys and girls are cast in typical roles that are recognized widely by society and a large percentage of the world. While there are many studies that have been done exploring the topic of children's perceptions of gender through television, there are few pieces of concrete evidence that tell people that what children are watching is actually harmful to them.<ref>Meyer, Nicole. 2015.

All three also operate secondary services with specialized scopes drawing upon their respective libraries, such as a focus on specific demographics, or a focus upon classic programming that fall within their scope and demographics.\n* [[Nickelodeon]], the first children's television channel, launched in 1979 (though its history traces back to the 1977 launch of The Pinwheel Network);<ref>http://www.viacom.com/ourbrands/medianetworks/mtvnetworks/Pages/nickelodeon.aspx{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> it consists largely of original series aimed at children, pre-teens and young teenagers, including animated series, to live-action comedy and action series, as well as series aimed at preschoolers, and appeals to adult and adolescent audiences with a lineup of mainly live-action sitcom reruns and a limited amount of original programming on [[Nick at Nite]].\n** Nickelodeon operates four digital cable and satellite channels separate from the main service: [[Nick Jr.]], a channel devoted to preschool programming;  [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]], which primarily (although not exclusively) runs animated programming; [[NickMusic]], a pop [[music video]] service branded as \"[[MTV]] Hits\" prior to 2016; and a channel space that is split between teenager-oriented [[TeenNick]] during the day and 1990s-centered rerun service [[NickRewind]] at night. This is in addition to a flexible number of free digital channels under the Nickelodeon brand on parent company [[ViacomCBS]]'s over-the-top service [[Pluto TV]].\n* [[Cartoon Network]], launched in 1992, primarily broadcasts children's shows, mostly animated programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. It is primarily aimed at children and young teenagers between the ages of 7-16 and targets older teens and adults with mature content during its late night/overnight daypart [[Adult Swim]].\n** Cartoon Network also operates [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], a channel that specializes in programs centered around classic brands that parent company Time Warner owns, along with some imported programs.\n* [[Disney Channel]] launched in 1983 as a [[pay television|premium channel]]; it consists of original first-run television series, theatrically released and original made-for-cable movies and select other third-party programming. Disney Channel \u2013 which formerly operated as a premium service \u2013 originally marketed its programs towards families during the 1980s, and later at younger children by the 1990s, and primarily at [[Teenybopper]] females aged 13-16 between 2006 and 2017, before returning to families.\n** Disney Channel operates two digital channels separate from the main service: [[Disney Junior]], which launched in 2012 and primarily broadcasts animated series catered towards a preschool audience, and [[Disney XD]], which caters primarily to an older youth audience with an action-oriented focus. Disney Channel does not have an outlet for its archive programming. Disney also operates [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], a channel primarily carrying live-action programming catered towards a teenage/young adult audience. Although its [[Television networks preceding Freeform|previous incarnations]] under different owners had family-oriented formats and children's programming, they have since been phased out in favor of series such as [[teen drama]]s, some coming from Disney Channel.\n\nUnder current mandates, all [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television station]]s in the United States must show a minimum of three hours per week of [[E/I|educational children's programming]], regardless of format. Until 2019, this rule also applied to [[digital subchannels]]; as a result, digital multicast networks whose formats should not fit children's programming, such as [[Live Well Network]] and [[TheCoolTV]], were required to carry educational programs to fit the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] mandates. (The rule for digital subchannels was repealed in July 2019;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/07/fcc-vote-to-ease-kid-vid-rules-draws-pushback-and-democrats-dissent-1202644411/|title=FCC's Vote To Ease \"Kid Vid\" Rules Draws Pushback And Democrats' Dissent|last=Hayes|first=Dade|date=July 10, 2019|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/fcc-gives-broadcasters-more-kidvid-flexibility|title=FCC Gives Broadcasters More KidVid Flexibility|last=Eggerton|first=John|date=July 10, 2019|website=Broadcasting & Cable|language=en-us|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> in practice, most still carry educational programs anyway.) In 2017, there was a programming block that aired on syndication called [[KidsClick]]; it was notable as a concerted effort to program children's shows on television without regard to their educational content, one of the first such efforts since the E/I rule took effect. The transition to digital television has allowed for the debut of whole subchannels that air children's programming 24/7; examples include [[Universal Kids]], [[Qubo]], [[Discovery Family]] and [[Smile (TV network)|Smile]]. [[PBS]], the United States' main [[public television]] network, devotes over eight hours of its weekday schedule, and several hours of its weekend schedule, to educational children's programs, and the country's only directly nationally operated TV service for public consumption, [[NASA TV]], also includes educational programs in its schedule for use in schools.\n\n===Canada===\n\nEnglish-language children's specialty channels in Canada are primarily owned by [[Corus Entertainment]] and [[DHX Media]]. Corus operates [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]], [[Treehouse TV|Treehouse]], and [[Teletoon]], as well as localized versions of the [[Cartoon Network (Canada)|Cartoon Network]], [[Disney Channel (Canada)|Disney Channel]], [[Disney Junior (Canada)|Disney Junior]], [[Disney XD (Canada)|Disney XD]], and [[Nickelodeon (Canada)|Nickelodeon]] brands. DHX operates [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]], as well as the spin-off services [[Chrgd]] and [[Family Jr.]] [[BBC Kids]] was the only English-language children's television channel in Canada that is not owned by Corus or DHX; since 2011 to its close in December 2018, it has been majority owned and operated by British Columbia's public broadcaster [[Knowledge Network]].\n\nIn [[French language|French]], Corus operates [[T\u00e9l\u00e9toon]] and [[La cha\u00eene Disney]], DHX operates [[T\u00e9l\u00e9magino]] (a French version of Family Jr.), [[TVA Group]] operates the preschool-oriented [[Yoopa]], and [[Bell Media]] runs the teen-oriented [[Vrak]].  Via its majority-owned subsidiary [[Telelatino]], Corus also operates two children and family-oriented networks in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], [[TeleNi\u00f1os]] and [[Telebimbi]] respectively.\n\nOn broadcast television and satellite to cable undertakings, children's television content is relegated to the country's public and designated provincial educational broadcasters, including [[CBC Television]] and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]], as well as [[City Saskatchewan]], [[CTV Two Alberta]] (formerly Access), [[Knowledge Network]], [[T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec]], [[TFO]], and [[TVOntario]] ([[TVOKids]].\n\nAided by the cultural similarities between Canada and the United States, along with film credits and subsidies available from the Canadian government, a large number of animated children's series have been made in Canada with the intention of exporting them to the United States. Such programs carry [[:File:Canada wordmark.svg|a prominent Government of Canada wordmark]] in their closing credits.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe [[BBC]] and [[ITV plc]] both operate children's oriented television networks on digital terrestrial television: the BBC runs [[CBBC]] as well as the preschool-oriented [[CBeebies]], while ITV runs [[CITV]]. Both channels were spun off from children's television strands on their respective flagship channels ([[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], and [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]). BBC and ITV have largely phased out children's programming from their main channels in order to focus on the dedicated services; in 2012, as part of the \"Delivering Quality First\" initiative, the BBC announced that it would end the broadcast of CBBC programmes on BBC One following the completion of the transition to digital terrestrial television, citing low viewership in comparison to broadcasts of the programmes on the CBBC channel.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18083178|title=Children's shows to leave BBC One|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 May 2012 | date=16 May 2012}}</ref> [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] also broadcasts a preschool-oriented block known as ''[[Milkshake!]]'', while its owner, [[Viacom International Media Networks Europe]], also runs versions of [[Nickelodeon UK|Nickelodeon]] and its sister networks [[Nicktoons (UK and Ireland)|Nicktoons]] and [[Nick Jr. (UK and Ireland)|Nick Jr.]]\n\n[[Sony Pictures Television]]-owned [[Pop (UK and Ireland)|Pop]], which formerly operated as a pay television channel, launched on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] on 20 March 2014.

Since 1998 [[RT\u00c92]] has provided children's programming from 07:00 to 17:30 each weekday, original titled [[The Den (Ireland)|The Den]], the service was renamed [[TRT\u00c9]] and RT\u00c9jr in 2010. Irish Language service [[TG4]] provide two strands of Children's programming C\u00fala 4 Na n\u00d3g and [[C\u00fala 4]] during the day. Commercial broadcaster [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] broadcast a children's strand called ''Gimme 3'' from 1998 - 1999. And Broadcast a new strand called [[3Kids]]\n\n===Australia===\nChildren's channels that exist in Australia are [[ABC Me]], [[ABC Kids (Australia)|ABC Kids]], [[KidsCo]], [[Disney Channel (Australia)|Disney Channel]] and its spin-off [[Disney Junior (Australia and New Zealand)|Disney Junior]], [[CBeebies]], [[Nickelodeon (Australia)|Nickelodeon]] and its spin-off [[Nick Jr. (Australia)|Nick Jr.]], and [[Cartoon Network (Australia)|Cartoon Network]] and its spin-off [[Boomerang (Australian TV channel)|Boomerang]].\n\n===Japan===\nChildren's channels that exist in Japan are [[NHK Educational TV]], [[Kids Station]], [[Disney XD (Japan)|Disney XD]], [[Nickelodeon (Japan)|Nickelodeon]] (now under a block on [[Animax]], known as \"Nick Time\") and [[Cartoon Network Japan|Cartoon Network]] (Cartoon Network's age demographic is moving towards older viewers with shows such as ''[[Regular Show]]'' and ''[[Adventure Time]]'').\n\n===Iceland===\nOne of the most well-known children's TV programs comes from Iceland, [[LazyTown]], was created by [[Magn\u00fas Scheving|Magnus Scheving]], European Gymnastics Champion and CEO of [[Lazytown Entertainment|LazyTown Entertainment]]. The show has aired in over 180 countries, been dubbed into more than 32 languages and is the most expensive children's show of all time.\n\n===India===\n{{Main articles|Category:Children%27s_television_channels_in_India}}\n[[Cartoon Network]] was the first channel for children launched in India in 1995. Subsequently, Disney and [[Nickelodeon]] Channel arrived. [[Hungama TV]] (2004) was first channel for kids that had local content. [[Pogo (TV channel)|Pogo]] and [[BabyTV]] came later by 2006. By 2018, 23 channels were aired in India.\n\n===Romania===\n[[Nickelodeon (Central & Eastern Europe)|Nickelodeon]] was the first children's channel in Romania, launched in December 1998. Afterwards, [[Minimax]] became the first Romanian children's channel to air locally produced content, launched on [[Children's Day]] in 2001.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20050217093201/http://www.minimaxtv.ro/min20.php?&l=1</ref> Since then, channels like [[BabyTV]] and [[Disney Channel (Romanian TV channel)|Disney Channel]] have arrived.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of local children's television series (United States)]]\n* [[Saturday-morning cartoon]] for an in-depth history of children's television in the United States\n* [[Advertising to children]]\n* [[List of children's television series by country]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tours/childrens/tourchildrens1.html Children's Television], online exhibition from [[screenonline]], a website of the [[British Film Institute]]\n* [http://www.pophistorynow.com The 1950s\u20132000s Week-By-Week - includes listings and factoids for local/national children's shows.]\n* [http://www.lasarletter.net/drupal/node/14 The future of children's digital television - an interview with Gloria Tristani]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Children's Television Series}}\n[[Category:Children's television series| ]]\n[[Category:Television by interest]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n[[Category:Children's television|*]]\n", "name_user": "205.250.230.226", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_television_series"}

While Joseph Ghanima and al-Jawaliqy believe it is from ''Bart Tilla'' meaning ''Daughter of Dew'', the priest Putros Saba al-Bartelly believes it comes from ''Beth Rattly'' meaning ''House of Weights''.\n\n==Early history==\nIn northern Iraq, until the 19th century, the [[maphrian]] was the regional head of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and reported to the [[List of Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch|Patriarch in Antioch]]. When Ignatius Elia'azar made Bartella his home and see in 1153, dissatisfaction erupted in the community since [[Mar Mattai Monastery]] has been the traditional see of the Orthodox maphrian. A compromise was finally reached and he returned to Mar Mattai. However, it was agreed that he would make it a tradition to visit Bartella to emphasize its importance. Bartella gained fame again in 1284 when Maphrian Gregoris bin al-Ebry built the Yohanna bin Najara Monastery.\n\nOther maphrians who made their see in Bartella were Dionysius Saliba II (1222\u20131231), Gregorius Barsuma (1288\u20131308), Gregorius Mattai I (1317\u20131345), Gregorius bar Qeenaya (forced to flee Bartella to Tikrit, and then to [[Baghdad]] where he was killed in 1361), and Athanasius Abraham II (1365\u20131379). Maphrian Qorlos (Cyril) Joseph III (1458\u20131470), known as Ibn Nissan, was the last Maphrian who chose Bartilla as his home. He stayed only for a short time in Bartilla and then left to Hamas where he died in 1470.\n\n[[File:Iraqvillagebartella2.JPG|thumb|Street of Bartella]]\n\n==Population==\nIn early August 2014, Bartella was overrun by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] [[Islamic extremists]].<ref name=\"Bulos\">Nabih Bulos, [http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-iraq-christians-20140919-story.html Iraqi Christians displaced by Sunni militants seek to flee abroad], ''Los Angeles Times'' (September 18, 2014).</ref> The Christian population of the town fled, mostly to [[Irbil]] in [[Kurdistan Region]], joining thousands of other [[Christians in Iraq|Iraqi Christians]] fleeing ISIL terror.<ref name=\"Bulos\"/><ref>Mariano Castillo, [http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/07/world/meast/iraq-isis-christian-city/ ISIS overtakes Iraq's largest Christian city], CNN (August 8, 2014).</ref><ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iraqi-christian-describes-terrifying-flee-isis-militants-n176111], NBC News (August 8, 2014).</ref>\nBefore the ISIS invasion, Bartella's population was around 30,000, with the majority being [[Syriac Christians]], including [[Eastern Catholic Syriacs]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Syriacs]]. Bartella was Christianized in the 2nd century. With the emergence of the [[Christological controversies]], the people and their church came under the dominion of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (often incorrectly or correctly known as [[Nestorian]]); however, it switched to the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] (mistakenly and loosely known as Jacobite) around AD 610. On November 23\u201324, 2013 during the 2-day \"Bartella Friends\" conference held in [[Erbil]] to discuss the demographic change due to the [[Shabak people|Shabaka]] exodus fleeing [[Mosul]] and the surrounding villages towards Bartella from 2003 on, it was announced that the percentage of Christians has dropped dramatically from 99% to 40%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D8%B5%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%AA-%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%81%D8%B6%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A9/a-17261856|title=\"\u0628\u0631\u0637\u0644\u0629\" \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u064a\u062d\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0635\u0628\u062d\u062a \u0634\u064a\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629 - \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0636\u064a\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 - DW.COM - 29.11.2013|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|work=dw.de|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Churches of Bartella==\nBartella and its vicinity has six churches, two partially demolished, one abandoned, one new, and two very old:\n\n*'''Mar Aho Dama Church'''\nThis church was in existence in 1153 when was expanded by Maphrian Ignatius II La'Azer. It was in use till 1386. Excavation in its ruins found the remains of three bishops which were moved to Mart Shmony Church.\n\n*'''Mart Shmony Church'''\nIt's unknown when this church was first built, however, it was reinvigorated for the first time in 1807, It was rebuilt again completely in 1869, and It was reinvigorated again in 1971.\n\n*'''Mar Giwargis Church'''\nThere are two churches with this name. The first is in ruins (recently renovated and reused) and is believed to be a monastery for St. Jerjis who built it around 1701. The second church was completed in 1939.\n\n*'''Church of the Virgin'''\nThis church was built in 1890 at the time of Qorlos Elias al-Mosuli who died in 1911. However, an inscription dating 16th century mentions the name of the Church of the Virgin which contradicts the date of 1890 and assumes that this church was standing at that time. The gate and part of the church were destroyed by ISIS sometime between August 2014 and October 2016.\n\n*'''Al-Sayida Church'''\nThe complete demolition of Al-Sayida Church came in 1934 as its bricks were used to build the new Mar Giwargis Church.\n\n*'''Ber Nagara Monastery'''\nThis monastery is named after Yohanan bit Nagara meaning \"Yohanan of the Carpenters\" since all his family were working as carpenters. It's believed that he used to worship pagans, and after converting to Christianity he was killed by his father and was buried in the village of Ba Agre. When this village was destroyed in 1282, his grave which was visited heavily by the locals was destroyed with it. That forced Maphrian Gregarious bin al-Ebry to build a temple for the martyr Yohanan in Bartella and was completed in 1285. On November 23, 1285, the remains of St. Yohanan, monks from Syria, and the 40 martyrs killed by the Persians were moved and reburied in this temple. Unfortunately, this monastery was destroyed in 1653 and again the remains were moved to St. Shmony church. Currently, all what exist of this monastery is a small room built recently as a reminder to its existence.\n\n==Latest events==\nOn August 31, 2004, three girls from Bartella were slaughtered while returning home from their work at a hospital in [[Mosul]] where they worked.<ref name=\"nineveh.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Christian%20Assyrians%20face%20Oppression%20and%20Murder%20in%20Iraq%20with%20the%20Rise%20of%20Islamists%20and%20Kurdish%20Power.html|title=Christen Assyrians face Oppression and Murder in Iraq with the Rise of Islamists and Kurdish Power|work=nineveh.com|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>\nOn November 19, 2004, two brothers from Bartella were killed while at work when a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar shell]] fell on the shop they worked at in Mosul market.<ref name=\"nineveh.com\"/>\n\nOn December 8, 2004, Dr. Ra'ad Augustine Qoryaqos, one of Bartella's notables and a successful surgeon who worked as a professor at the College of Medicine in [[Al Anbar University|University of Anbar]], was murdered in [[Ramadi]].

While Joseph Ghanima and al-Jawaliqy believe it is from ''Bart Tilla'' meaning ''Daughter of Dew'', the priest Putros Saba al-Bartelly believes it comes from ''Beth Rattly'' meaning ''House of Weights''.\n\n==Early history==\nIn northern Iraq, until the 19th century, the [[maphrian]] was the regional head of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and reported to the [[List of Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch|Patriarch in Antioch]]. When Ignatius Elia'azar made Bartella his home and see in 1153, dissatisfaction erupted in the community since [[Mar Mattai Monastery]] has been the traditional see of the Orthodox maphrian. A compromise was finally reached and he returned to Mar Mattai. However, it was agreed that he would make it a tradition to visit Bartella to emphasize its importance. Bartella gained fame again in 1284 when Maphrian Gregoris bin al-Ebry built the Yohanna bin Najara Monastery.\n\nOther maphrians who made their see in Bartella were Dionysius Saliba II (1222\u20131231), Gregorius Barsuma (1288\u20131308), Gregorius Mattai I (1317\u20131345), Gregorius bar Qeenaya (forced to flee Bartella to Tikrit, and then to [[Baghdad]] where he was killed in 1361), and Athanasius Abraham II (1365\u20131379). Maphrian Qorlos (Cyril) Joseph III (1458\u20131470), known as Ibn Nissan, was the last Maphrian who chose Bartilla as his home. He stayed only for a short time in Bartilla and then left to Hamas where he died in 1470.\n\n[[File:Iraqvillagebartella2.JPG|thumb|Street of Bartella]]\n\n==Population==\nIn early August 2014, Bartella was overrun by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] [[Islamic extremists]].<ref name=\"Bulos\">Nabih Bulos, [http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-iraq-christians-20140919-story.html Iraqi Christians displaced by Sunni militants seek to flee abroad], ''Los Angeles Times'' (September 18, 2014).</ref> The Christian population of the town fled, mostly to [[Irbil]] in [[Kurdistan Region]], joining thousands of other [[Christians in Iraq|Iraqi Christians]] fleeing ISIL terror.<ref name=\"Bulos\"/><ref>Mariano Castillo, [http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/07/world/meast/iraq-isis-christian-city/ ISIS overtakes Iraq's largest Christian city], CNN (August 8, 2014).</ref><ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iraqi-christian-describes-terrifying-flee-isis-militants-n176111], NBC News (August 8, 2014).</ref>\nBefore the ISIS invasion, Bartella's population was around 30,000, with the majority being [[Syriac Christians]], including [[Eastern Catholic Syriacs]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Syriacs]]. Bartella was Christianized in the 2nd century. With the emergence of the [[Christological controversies]], the people and their church came under the dominion of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (often incorrectly or correctly known as [[Nestorian]]); however, it switched to the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] (mistakenly and loosely known as Jacobite) around AD 610. On November 23\u201324, 2013 during the 2-day \"Bartella Friends\" conference held in [[Erbil]] to discuss the demographic change due to the [[Shabak people|Shabaka]] exodus fleeing [[Mosul]] and the surrounding villages towards Bartella from 2003 on, it was announced that the percentage of Christians has dropped dramatically from 99% to 40%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D8%B5%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%AA-%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%81%D8%B6%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A9/a-17261856|title=\"\u0628\u0631\u0637\u0644\u0629\" \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u064a\u062d\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0635\u0628\u062d\u062a \u0634\u064a\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629 - \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0636\u064a\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 - DW.COM - 29.11.2013|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|work=dw.de|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Churches of Bartella==\nBartella and its vicinity has six churches, two partially demolished, one abandoned, one new, and two very old:\n\n*'''Mar Aho Dama Church'''\nThis church was in existence in 1153 when was expanded by Maphrian Ignatius II La'Azer. It was in use till 1386. Excavation in its ruins found the remains of three bishops which were moved to Mart Shmony Church.\n\n*'''Mart Shmony Church'''\nIt's unknown when this church was first built, however, it was reinvigorated for the first time in 1807, It was rebuilt again completely in 1869, and It was reinvigorated again in 1971.\n\n*'''Mar Giwargis Church'''\nThere are two churches with this name. The first is in ruins (recently renovated and reused) and is believed to be a monastery for St. Jerjis who built it around 1701. The second church was completed in 1939.\n\n*'''Church of the Virgin'''\nThis church was built in 1890 at the time of Qorlos Elias al-Mosuli who died in 1911. However, an inscription dating 16th century mentions the name of the Church of the Virgin which contradicts the date of 1890 and assumes that this church was standing at that time. The gate and part of the church were destroyed by ISIS sometime between August 2014 and October 2016.\n\n*'''Al-Sayida Church'''\nThe complete demolition of Al-Sayida Church came in 1934 as its bricks were used to build the new Mar Giwargis Church.\n\n*'''Ber Nagara Monastery'''\nThis monastery is named after Yohanan bit Nagara meaning \"Yohanan of the Carpenters\" since all his family were working as carpenters. It's believed that he used to worship pagans, and after converting to Christianity he was killed by his father and was buried in the village of Ba Agre. When this village was destroyed in 1282, his grave which was visited heavily by the locals was destroyed with it. That forced Maphrian Gregarious bin al-Ebry to build a temple for the martyr Yohanan in Bartella and was completed in 1285. On November 23, 1285, the remains of St. Yohanan, monks from Syria, and the 40 martyrs killed by the Persians were moved and reburied in this temple. Unfortunately, this monastery was destroyed in 1653 and again the remains were moved to St. Shmony church. Currently, all what exist of this monastery is a small room built recently as a reminder to its existence.\n\n==Latest events==\nOn August 31, 2004, three girls from Bartella were slaughtered while returning home from their work at a hospital in [[Mosul]] where they worked.<ref name=\"nineveh.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Christian%20Assyrians%20face%20Oppression%20and%20Murder%20in%20Iraq%20with%20the%20Rise%20of%20Islamists%20and%20Kurdish%20Power.html|title=Christen Assyrians face Oppression and Murder in Iraq with the Rise of Islamists and Kurdish Power|work=nineveh.com|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>\nOn November 19, 2004, two brothers from Bartella were killed while at work when a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar shell]] fell on the shop they worked at in Mosul market.<ref name=\"nineveh.com\"/>\n\nOn December 8, 2004, Dr. Ra'ad Augustine Qoryaqos, one of Bartella's notables and a successful surgeon who worked as a professor at the College of Medicine in [[Al Anbar University|University of Anbar]], was murdered in [[Ramadi]].

The purpose of the K-1 Visa is to allow time for the couple to make arrangements for and actually have the marriage ceremony.  The visa is not to give the couple time \"to decide IF\" they will marry. Each couple has already signed document(s) stating that they have promised to marry each other, and provided the signed document(s) to the US Immigration services to get the K-1 Visa. \n\nThe series debuted on January 12, 2014, and has been renewed through its seventh season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a27214674/90-day-fiance-season-7-news-cast-spoilers/|title=When Is a New Season of \u201890 Day Fianc\u00e9\u2019 Coming?|last=Beck|first=Laura|date=2019-04-25|website=Cosmopolitan|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe series currently has six spin-offs: ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After]]'', which documents the ups and downs of past ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9'' couples after their marriage; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9]]: Before the 90 Days,'' which follows couples that have met each other online, but have not yet started the K-1 visa process; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: What Now?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: What Now?]],'' an original digital series that gives updates on past 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 couples; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: The Other Way|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: The Other Way]],'' a dedicated series to couples where the American partner permanently moves into their partner's home country instead of the foreign partner doing so; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Pillow Talk|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Pillow Talk]],'' a reaction show featuring a number of previous cast members that take part in reacting to an episode of ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After; and [[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#The Family Chantel|The Family Chantel]],'' focused on the relationship of ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9'' season four cast members Pedro and Chantel, and their immediate family.\n\n==''K-1 visa process''==\n{{Main|K-1 visa}}\nThe show is based on the K-1 visa process, which begins with the petitioner meeting the beneficiary inside or outside the United States, then filing a I-129F petition with evidence of meeting and of a relationship. After the petition is approved, the petitioner must pass biometrics and then the process is sent to the foreign embassy of the beneficiary. The beneficiary then files for a visa, before or after passing the medical requirements and is called for an interview, in which the beneficiary must prove that they meet the requirements of the visa, including having strong evidence of meeting and a valid relationship. If approved, the foreign fianc\u00e9 travels to the States to live with his or her prospective American spouse. The couple must marry within 90 days, otherwise the beneficiary must leave the country. The couple may face language barriers, culture shock, the stigma of being thought of as a \"[[mail-order bride]]\" as well as skepticism of friends and family.  Professor Lenni B. Benson of the New York Law School has stated that  although the K-1 visa program is widely associated with [[sham marriage]]s, \"It is not true in the majority of cases.\"  <ref>{{cite news |title=\u201890 Day Fianc\u00e9\u2019: An Anti-Fantasy for Troubled Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/arts/television/90-day-fiance-immigration.html |accessdate=20 August 2019 |publisher=New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Season 1 cast==\n\n===Russ & Paola===\nRuss Mayfield (27, from [[Owasso, Oklahoma]]) met Paola \"Pao\" (26, from [[Bucaramanga]], [[Colombia]]), a fashion designer, while he was in Colombia on a work assignment in the [[petroleum industry]].

However, the two reconciled and Anfisa agreed to travel to the United States. Jorge pleaded guilty to marijuana trafficking, which made it hard for him to rent an apartment. They moved into a hotel and Anfisa was not impressed (though why exactly Jorge does not have his own place to live has not been revealed). They later moved into a small apartment. Jorge did not buy an engagement ring or wedding dress for Anfisa, and Jorge's friends and family became concerned about Anfisa's motives. Anfisa admitted that she was indeed interested in Jorge providing for her and stated that while she may be using Jorge for his money, Jorge is primarily interested in her for her looks and would not want to marry her if she was ugly. Anfisa considered returning to Russia, and Jorge considered not trying to stop her. They later got married alone in a simple courthouse ceremony, after which Jorge promised both to buy a ring for Anfisa and to hold a bigger ceremony her family could attend.\n\nJorge's sister confronted Anfisa at a restaurant about her demands. They remained living in a small apartment, Jorge did not buy Anfisa a ring.  Later they separated for a few months and Anfisa got a new apartment, driver's license and a car.

Nicole is thrilled to be in Morocco with Azan (later calling him her \"Arabian Prince\"), though he has a hard time persuading her that in his culture it is not acceptable for unmarried couples to be physically affectionate. Nicole persists in trying to hug and kiss Azan, which only causes him to become irritated. Nicole feels shunned and unsure of their relationship. Azan takes Nicole to [[Agadir]] to visit his family; she is warmly welcomed by the family. Nicole later reveals that she cheated on Azan, which could end the relationship. Azan takes Nicole to the desert and proposes, and she accepts. However, she continues to chafe at the customs of the [[Culture of Islam]]. She refuses to convert to [[Islam]] and he refuses to convert to [[Christianity]].

Chantel frequently went to the Dominican Republic to visit him, and on one of those trips he proposed to her. Chantel was worried that her family would think that Pedro was only going after a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] to enter the U.S, so she told her parents that he was in America on a student [[travel visa]]. Eventually, Chantel and Pedro married in the United States, but they planned to marry in the Dominican Republic as well, although he didn't think her family would want to go. They did all go to the Dominican Republic, but explosive fights kept breaking out, since Pedro's family now expected him to send them money.

Pedro's family offered Chantel's family [[chicken feet]], which they took as a sign of disrespect. They did get married and reside in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

Each couple has already signed document(s) stating that they have promised to marry each other, and provided the signed document(s) to the US Immigration services to get the K-1 Visa. \n\nThe series debuted on January 12, 2014, and has been renewed through its seventh season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a27214674/90-day-fiance-season-7-news-cast-spoilers/|title=When Is a New Season of \u201890 Day Fianc\u00e9\u2019 Coming?|last=Beck|first=Laura|date=2019-04-25|website=Cosmopolitan|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe series currently has six spin-offs: ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After]]'', which documents the ups and downs of past ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9'' couples after their marriage; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9]]: Before the 90 Days,'' which follows couples that have met each other online, but have not yet started the K-1 visa process; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: What Now?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: What Now?]],'' an original digital series that gives updates on past 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 couples; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: The Other Way|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: The Other Way]],'' a dedicated series to couples where the American partner permanently moves into their partner's home country instead of the foreign partner doing so; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Pillow Talk|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Pillow Talk]],'' a reaction show featuring a number of previous cast members that take part in reacting to an episode of ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After; and [[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#The Family Chantel|The Family Chantel]],'' focused on the relationship of ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9'' season four cast members Pedro and Chantel, and their immediate family.\n\n==''K-1 visa process''==\n{{Main|K-1 visa}}\nThe show is based on the K-1 visa process, which begins with the petitioner meeting the beneficiary inside or outside the United States, then filing a I-129F petition with evidence of meeting and of a relationship. After the petition is approved, the petitioner must pass biometrics and then the process is sent to the foreign embassy of the beneficiary. The beneficiary then files for a visa, before or after passing the medical requirements and is called for an interview, in which the beneficiary must prove that they meet the requirements of the visa, including having strong evidence of meeting and a valid relationship. If approved, the foreign fianc\u00e9 travels to the States to live with his or her prospective American spouse. The couple must marry within 90 days, otherwise the beneficiary must leave the country. The couple may face language barriers, culture shock, the stigma of being thought of as a \"[[mail-order bride]]\" as well as skepticism of friends and family.  Professor Lenni B. Benson of the New York Law School has stated that  although the K-1 visa program is widely associated with [[sham marriage]]s, \"It is not true in the majority of cases.\"  <ref>{{cite news |title=\u201890 Day Fianc\u00e9\u2019: An Anti-Fantasy for Troubled Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/arts/television/90-day-fiance-immigration.html |accessdate=20 August 2019 |publisher=New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Season 1 cast==\n\n===Russ & Paola===\nRuss Mayfield (27, from [[Owasso, Oklahoma]]) met Paola \"Pao\" (26, from [[Bucaramanga]], [[Colombia]]), a fashion designer, while he was in Colombia on a work assignment in the [[petroleum industry]].
