The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by [[Roy Huggins]] and [[John Pogue]]. The film is a spin-off to the 1993 motion picture ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', which in turn was based on the [[The Fugitive (TV series)|television series of the same name]], created by Huggins. The story does not involve the character of [[Dr. Richard Kimble]], portrayed by [[Harrison Ford]] in the initial film, but instead the plot centers on United States Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard, once again played by [[Tommy Lee Jones]]. The plot follows Gerard and his team as they pursue another fugitive, Mark Sheridan, played by [[Wesley Snipes]], who attempts to escape government officials following an international conspiracy scandal. The cast features [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Joe Pantoliano]], [[Daniel Roebuck]], [[Thomas Mills Wood|Tom Wood]], and [[LaTanya Richardson]], several of whom portrayed Deputy Marshals in the previous film.\n\nThe film was a co-production between [[Warner Bros.]] and Kopelson Entertainment. The score was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]].\n\n''U.S. Marshals'' premiered in theaters in the United States on March 6, 1998, grossing $57 million in its domestic run. The film took in an additional $45 million through international release for a worldwide total of $102 million. The film was generally met with mixed critical reviews. The film was released on home video on July 21, 1998.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agents are killed while trying to intercept a briefcase exchange taking place in a [[United Nations]] parking garage. The murders are caught on a security camera, but the criminal escapes with top secret information.\n\nMonths later, tow truck driver Mark Warren is arrested for an illegal weapons possession charge following a vehicular collision in Chicago. Through a fingerprint check, the police determine that he is actually federal fugitive Mark Roberts, wanted for a homicide. Roberts boards a prisoner transport aircraft back to New York, sharing the flight with Deputy [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Samuel Gerard, who is escorting prisoners unrelated to Roberts' case. Roberts thwarts an assassination attempt by a Chinese prisoner with an [[improvised firearm]], but the bullet pierces a window and depressurizes the cabin, forcing an emergency landing which leads to a crash in Southern Illinois . Gerard discovers Roberts has fled the crash site. DSS Special Agent John Royce is assigned to join Gerard's team to hunt Roberts.\n\nRoberts flees to New York City. There, he secures money, weapons and fake identification. Roberts also begins conducting surveillance on a Chinese diplomat named Xiang Chen. In Chicago, Gerard and the Marshals pursue several leads, including Roberts' girlfriend Marie Bineaux as well as the airplane mechanic who hid the zip gun, whom the Marshals find murdered by Chen. Gerard and his colleagues watch the surveillance footage of the murders in the parking garage and realize that Roberts acted in self-defense and was wearing gloves; thus couldn't have been identified by fingerprints at the scene as was earlier claimed. Confronted with the evidence, DSS Director Bertram Lamb informs Gerard that Mark Roberts is in fact Mark Sheridan, a former [[CIA]] [[Special Activities Division]] operative and a former [[Force Recon]] Marine, that went rogue during an investigation to uncover a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] within the U.S. State Department that had been selling covert secrets to China. Chen was the contact delivering the money to Sheridan for the information and when DSS agents tried to apprehend him, Sheridan killed them in resistance and fled the scene.\n\nEventually, Gerard and his team catch up with Sheridan in Queens Hill Cemetery where he meets with, and threatens to expose, DSS Special Agent Frank Barrows as one of the conspirators who framed him. Chen tries to assassinate Sheridan as he leaves the cemetery, but inadvertently kills Barrows instead. Sheridan flees to a retirement home followed by Gerard, Royce and Deputy Marshal Noah Newman. Meanwhile, Chen is caught and detained by Deputy Marshals Savannah Cooper and Bob Biggs. At the senior care facility, Newman overhears a physical struggle and walks into a room where he witnesses Royce holding Sheridan at gunpoint. Royce suddenly shoots Newman with his gun and later lies to his associates, claiming Sheridan shot Newman. Sheridan escapes by jumping from the building onto the roof of a passing train. Newman dies of his gunshot wound.\n\nAfter retrieving fingerprints from an abandoned vehicle at a marine loading dock, Gerard tracks down Sheridan on a freighter bound for Canada. During a scuffle between Sheridan and Gerard aboard the vessel, Royce shoots Sheridan, injuring him. Sheridan is later taken into custody. Gerard begins to suspect Royce may be the mole when he notices the firearm that shot Newman had its serial number filed off (in an attempt to hide it), was actually Royce's own gun earlier. Left alone to guard Sheridan's hospital room, Royce wakes Sheridan up to murder him just as Gerard steps in and kills Royce first. After leaving the hospital, Sheridan's charges are dropped as he is exonerated and released from custody.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Wesleysnipes cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Wesley Snipes, who portrayed Mark Sheridan.]]\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Mark J.

The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by [[Roy Huggins]] and [[John Pogue]]. The film is a spin-off to the 1993 motion picture ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', which in turn was based on the [[The Fugitive (TV series)|television series of the same name]], created by Huggins. The story does not involve the character of [[Dr. Richard Kimble]], portrayed by [[Harrison Ford]] in the initial film, but instead the plot centers on United States Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard, once again played by [[Tommy Lee Jones]]. The plot follows Gerard and his team as they pursue another fugitive, Mark Sheridan, played by [[Wesley Snipes]], who attempts to escape government officials following an international conspiracy scandal. The cast features [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Joe Pantoliano]], [[Daniel Roebuck]], [[Thomas Mills Wood|Tom Wood]], and [[LaTanya Richardson]], several of whom portrayed Deputy Marshals in the previous film.\n\nThe film was a co-production between [[Warner Bros.]] and Kopelson Entertainment. The score was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]].\n\n''U.S. Marshals'' premiered in theaters in the United States on March 6, 1998, grossing $57 million in its domestic run. The film took in an additional $45 million through international release for a worldwide total of $102 million. The film was generally met with mixed critical reviews. The film was released on home video on July 21, 1998.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agents are killed while trying to intercept a briefcase exchange taking place in a [[United Nations]] parking garage. The murders are caught on a security camera, but the criminal escapes with top secret information.\n\nMonths later, tow truck driver Mark Warren is arrested for an illegal weapons possession charge following a vehicular collision in Chicago. Through a fingerprint check, the police determine that he is actually federal fugitive Mark Roberts, wanted for a homicide. Roberts boards a prisoner transport aircraft back to New York, sharing the flight with Deputy [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Samuel Gerard, who is escorting prisoners unrelated to Roberts' case. Roberts thwarts an assassination attempt by a Chinese prisoner with an [[improvised firearm]], but the bullet pierces a window and depressurizes the cabin, forcing an emergency landing which leads to a crash in Southern Illinois . Gerard discovers Roberts has fled the crash site. DSS Special Agent John Royce is assigned to join Gerard's team to hunt Roberts.\n\nRoberts flees to New York City. There, he secures money, weapons and fake identification. Roberts also begins conducting surveillance on a Chinese diplomat named Xiang Chen. In Chicago, Gerard and the Marshals pursue several leads, including Roberts' girlfriend Marie Bineaux as well as the airplane mechanic who hid the zip gun, whom the Marshals find murdered by Chen. Gerard and his colleagues watch the surveillance footage of the murders in the parking garage and realize that Roberts acted in self-defense and was wearing gloves; thus couldn't have been identified by fingerprints at the scene as was earlier claimed. Confronted with the evidence, DSS Director Bertram Lamb informs Gerard that Mark Roberts is in fact Mark Sheridan, a former [[CIA]] [[SAD|Special Activities Division]] operative and a former [[Force Recon]] Marine, that went rogue during an investigation to uncover a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] within the U.S. State Department that had been selling covert secrets to China. Chen was the contact delivering the money to Sheridan for the information and when DSS agents tried to apprehend him, Sheridan killed them in resistance and fled the scene.\n\nEventually, Gerard and his team catch up with Sheridan in Queens Hill Cemetery where he meets with, and threatens to expose, DSS Special Agent Frank Barrows as one of the conspirators who framed him. Chen tries to assassinate Sheridan as he leaves the cemetery, but inadvertently kills Barrows instead. Sheridan flees to a retirement home followed by Gerard, Royce and Deputy Marshal Noah Newman. Meanwhile, Chen is caught and detained by Deputy Marshals Savannah Cooper and Bob Biggs. At the senior care facility, Newman overhears a physical struggle and walks into a room where he witnesses Royce holding Sheridan at gunpoint. Royce suddenly shoots Newman with his gun and later lies to his associates, claiming Sheridan shot Newman. Sheridan escapes by jumping from the building onto the roof of a passing train. Newman dies of his gunshot wound.\n\nAfter retrieving fingerprints from an abandoned vehicle at a marine loading dock, Gerard tracks down Sheridan on a freighter bound for Canada. During a scuffle between Sheridan and Gerard aboard the vessel, Royce shoots Sheridan, injuring him. Sheridan is later taken into custody. Gerard begins to suspect Royce may be the mole when he notices the firearm that shot Newman had its serial number filed off (in an attempt to hide it), was actually Royce's own gun earlier. Left alone to guard Sheridan's hospital room, Royce wakes Sheridan up to murder him just as Gerard steps in and kills Royce first. After leaving the hospital, Sheridan's charges are dropped as he is exonerated and released from custody.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Wesleysnipes cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Wesley Snipes, who portrayed Mark Sheridan.]]\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Mark J.

It is the reference formation for this interval. The Posidonia Shale of [[Dotternhausen]] and [[Schesslitz]] is well dated on the basis of ammonite and microfossil biostratigraphy.

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

It is the reference formation for this interval. The Posidonia Shale of [[Dotternhausen]] and [[Schesslitz]] is well dated on the basis of ammonite and microfossil biostratigraphy. The Lower Toarcian sections are subdivided into three ammonite biozones ([[Dactyloceras]] tenuicostatum, [[Harpoceras]] falciferum, and [[Hildoceras]] bifrons) and several subzones.

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.
