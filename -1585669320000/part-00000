He acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defence of Troy, \"killing 31,000 Greek fighters.\" He was ultimately killed by [[Achilles]].\n\n==Etymology==\nIn Greek, {{transl|grc|H\u00e9kt\u014dr}} is a derivative of the verb {{lang-grc|\u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd|\u00e9khein|label=none}}, archaic form *{{lang-grc|\u1f15\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd|h\u00e9khein|label=none}} ('to have' or 'to hold'), from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/se\u01f5\u02b0-|se\u011dh-]]'' ('to hold').<ref>[[Robert S.

Hector's name could thus be taken to mean 'holding fast'.<ref>This etymology is given under \"[https://www.etymonline.com/word/hector#etymonline_v_46401 Hector]\" in the ''Online Etymological Dictionary'', which, if true, would make it an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] name, of root *''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/se\u01f5\u02b0-|se\u011dh-]]''. The [[Dardanians (Trojan)|Dardanians]] would not have been Greek, but the [[Trojan language|language of the city of Troy]] is still an open question.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\nAs the first-born [[List of children of Priam|son]] of King [[Priam]] and Queen [[Hecuba]], who was a descendant of [[Dardanus (son of Zeus)|Dardanus]] and [[Tros (mythology)|Tros]], the founder of Troy.<ref>''Iliad'', XX, 215 ''ff.''</ref> In some accounts, his father was the god [[Apollo]].<ref>[[Stesichorus]], Fr. 108; [[Tzetzes]], ''On Lycophron''; Porphyry in his ''Omissions'' states that [[Ibycus]], Alexander, [[Euphorion (playwright)|Euphorion]] and [[Lycophron]] all made Hector the son of Apollo</ref> He was a prince of the royal house and the [[heir apparent]] to his father's throne. He was married to [[Andromache]], with whom he had an infant son, [[Scamandrius]] (whom the people of Troy called [[Astyanax]]).\n\nDuring the European Middle Ages, Hector figures as one of the [[Nine Worthies]] noted by [[Jacques de Longuyon]], known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, [[Homer]] places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. [[James M. Redfield|James Redfield]] describes Hector as a \"martyr to loyalties, a witness to the things of this world, a hero ready to die for the precious imperfections of ordinary life.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=James M. |last=Redfield |title=Nature and Culture in the Iliad: The Tragedy of Hector |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |date=1994 |page=ix}}</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n\n===Greatest warrior of Troy===\n\n[[File:Hektor wirft Paris seine Weichlichkeit vor (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|250px|''Hector Admonishes Paris for His Softness and Exhorts Him to Go to War'' by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|J. H. W. Tischbein]] (1751\u20131828)]]\n\nAccording to the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector did not approve of war between the [[Greeks]] and the Trojans.\n\nFor ten years, the Achaeans besieged Troy and their allies in the east. Hector commanded the Trojan army, with a number of subordinates including [[Polydamas (Iliad)|Polydamas]], and his brothers [[Deiphobus]], [[Helenus]] and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. By all accounts, Hector was the best warrior the Trojans and their allies could field, and his fighting prowess was admired by Greeks and his own people alike.\n\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]], when faced with his attack, described him as what [[Robert Fagles]] translated as an 'incredible dynamite' and a 'maniac'.\n\n====Duel with Protesilaus====\nIn the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector's exploits in the war prior to the events of the book are recapitulated. He had fought the Greek champion [[Protesilaus]] in single combat at the start of the war and killed him. A prophecy had stated that the first Greek to land on Trojan soil would die. Thus, [[Protesilaus]], [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]], and [[Odysseus]] would not land. Finally, Odysseus threw his shield out and landed on that, and Protesilaus jumped next from his own ship. In the ensuing fight, Hector killed him, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n[[File:Ajax and Hector exchange gifts.jpg|250px|thumb|Ajax and Hector exchange gifts ([[woodcut]] in [[Andrea Alciato|Andreas Alciatus]], ''Emblematum libellus'', 1591).]]\n\n====Duel with Ajax====\nAs described by Homer in the Iliad<ref>''Iliad'', VII 43\u2013305.</ref> at the advice of Hector\u2019s brother [[Helenus]] (who also was divinely inspired) and being told by him that he was not destined to die yet, Hector managed to get both armies seated and challenged any one of the Greek warriors to [[single combat]]. The [[Argives]] were initially reluctant to accept the challenge. However, after [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]'s chiding, nine Greek [[hero]]es stepped up to the challenge and drew by lot to see who was to face Hector. [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] won and fought Hector. Hector was unable to pierce Ajax's famous shield, but Ajax crushed Hector's shield with a rock and stabbed through his armor with a spear, drawing blood, upon which the god Apollo intervened and the duel was ended as the sun was setting. Hector gave Ajax his sword, which Ajax later used to kill himself. Ajax gave Hector his girdle that Achilles later attached to his chariot to drag Hector's corpse around the walls of Troy.\n\nThe Greeks and the Trojans made a truce to bury the dead. In the early dawn the next day, the Greeks took advantage of the truce to build a wall and ditch around the ships while Zeus watched in the distance.<ref>''Iliad'', VII, 433 ''ff.''</ref>\n\n====Duel with Achilles====\nAnother mention of Hector's exploits in the early years of war was given in the [[Iliad]] in book IX. During the embassy to [[Achilles]], Odysseus, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]] and [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] all try to persuade Achilles to rejoin the fight. In his response, Achilles points out that while Hector was terrorizing the Greek forces now, and that while he himself had fought in their front lines, Hector had 'no wish' to take his force far beyond the walls and out from the Skiaian Gate and nearby oak tree. He then claims, 'There he stood up to me alone one day, and he barely escaped my onslaught.'\nAnother duel that took place, although Hector received help from [[Aeneas]] (his cousin<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aeneas</ref>) and Deiphobus, was when Hector rushed to try to save his brother Troilus from Achilles' hands. But he came too late and Troilus had already perished. All Hector could do was to take the lifeless body of Troilus while Achilles escaped after he fought his way through from the Trojans reinforcement.\n\n[[File:Hector Astyanax MN Jatta.jpg|thumb|250px|Hector's last visit with his wife, [[Andromache]], and infant son [[Astyanax]], startled by his father's helmet ([[Apulian vase painting|Apulian red-figure vase]], 370\u2013360 BC)]]\n\nIn the tenth year of the war, observing [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] avoiding combat with [[Menelaus]], Hector upbraids him with having brought trouble on his whole country and now refusing to fight. Paris therefore proposes [[single combat]] between himself and Menelaus, with [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] to go to the victor, ending the war.<ref>''Iliad'', III.</ref> The duel, however, leads to inconclusive results due to intervention by [[Aphrodite]] who leads Paris off the field. After [[Pandarus]]  wounds [[Menelaus]] with an arrow the fight begins again.\n\nThe Greeks attack and drive the Trojans back. Hector must now go out to lead a counter-attack. According to Homer<ref>Iliad, VI 390\u2013480</ref> his wife [[Andromache]], carrying in her arms her son [[Astyanax]], intercepts Hector at the gate, pleading with him not to go out for her sake as well as his son's. Hector knows that Troy and the house of Priam are doomed to fall and that the gloomy fate of his wife and infant son will be to die or go into slavery in a foreign land. With understanding, compassion, and tenderness he explains that he cannot personally refuse to fight, and comforts her with the idea that no one can take him until it is his time to go. The gleaming bronze helmet frightens Astyanax and makes him cry.<ref>This Trojan helmet was made famous by Denys L. Page in ''History and the Homeric Iliad'', Chapter VI, \"Some Mycenaean relics in the Iliad\", as the Greeks do not wear bronze helmets in the poem's [[Oral-formulaic composition|epic formulae]], but they did in the Homeric Age; therefore, scholar Denys L. Page concludes (on other evidence as well) that the bronze helmet of Hector descends in oral poetry from [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times.</ref> Hector takes it off, embraces his wife and son, and for his sake prays aloud to [[Zeus]] that his son might be chief after him, become more glorious in battle than he, to bring home the blood of his enemies, and make his mother proud. Once he left for battle, those in the house began to mourn as they knew he would not return. Hector and Paris pass through the gate and rally the Trojans, raising havoc among the Greeks.\n\n===Trojan counter-attack===\nZeus [[Weighing of souls|weighs the fates]] of the two armies in the balance, and that of the Greeks sinks down. The Trojans press the Greeks into their camp over the ditch and wall and would have laid hands on the ships, but [[Agamemnon]] rallies the Greeks in person. The Trojans are driven off, night falls, and Hector resolves to take the camp and burn the ships the next day. The Trojans bivouac in the field.\n{{quote|A thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain ....<ref>''Iliad'', VIII, 542 ''ff.''</ref>}}\n\nThe next day Agamemnon rallies the Greeks and drives the Trojans\n{{quote|like a herd of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them ...<ref>''Iliad'', XI, 171 ''ff.''</ref>}}\nHector refrains from battle until Agamemnon leaves the field, wounded in the arm by a spear. Then Hector rallies the Trojans:\n{{quote|... like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea ...|sign=|source=}}\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]] hinder Hector and win the Greeks some time to retreat, but the Trojans sweep down upon the wall and rain blows upon it. The Greeks in the camp contest the gates to secure entrance for their fleeing warriors. The Trojans try to pull down the ramparts while the Greeks rain arrows upon them. Hector smashes open a gate with a large stone, clears the gate and calls on the Trojans to scale the wall, which they do, and\n{{quote|... all was uproar and confusion.<ref>''Iliad'', XII.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:THAM-Battle at the ships sarcophagus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle at the ships, on a [[Roman Empire|Roman-era]] [[sarcophagus]], 225\u2013250 AD]]\n\nThe battle rages inside the camp. Hector goes down, hit by a stone thrown by Ajax, but [[Apollo]] arrives from Olympus and infuses strength into \"the shepherd of the people\", who orders a chariot attack, with Apollo clearing the way. Many combats, deaths, boasts, threats, epithets, figures of speech, stories, lines of poetry and books of the Iliad later, Hector lays hold of [[Protesilaus]]' ship and calls for fire. The Trojans cannot bring it to him, as Ajax kills everyone who tries. Eventually, Hector breaks Ajax' spear with his sword, forcing him to give ground, and he sets the ship afire.<ref>''Iliad'', XV, end.</ref>\n\nThese events are all according to the will of the gods, who have decreed the fall of Troy, and therefore intend to tempt Achilles back into the war. [[Patroclus]], Achilles' closest companion, disguised in the armor of [[Achilles]], enters the combat leading the [[Myrmidons]] and the rest of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] to force a Trojan withdrawal. After Patroclus has routed the Trojan army, Hector, with the aid of [[Apollo]] and [[Euphorbus]], kills Patroclus, vaunting over him:\n{{quote|\"Wretch! Achilleus, great as he was, could do nothing to help you.\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\">The Iliad, book XVI</ref>}}\nThe dying Patroclus foretells Hector's death:\n{{quote|\"You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already death and powerful destiny are standing beside you, to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\" />}}\n\n===Hector's last fight===\n\n{{quote|Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. ... death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it \u2013 for so [[Zeus]] and his son [[Apollo]] the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.|cite=Spoken by Hector facing [[Achilles]], after a missed spear-throw; ''Iliad'', Book XXII, lines 299\u2013305}}\n\nHector strips the armor of Achilles off the fallen Patroclus and gives it to his men to take back to the city. Glaucus accuses Hector of cowardice for not challenging Ajax. Stung, Hector calls for the armor, puts it on, and uses it to rally the Trojans.  [[Zeus]] regards the donning of a hero's armor as an act of insolence by a fool about to die, but it makes Hector strong for now.<ref>''Iliad'', XVII</ref>\n\nThe next day, the enraged Achilles renounces the wrath that kept him out of action and routs the Trojans, forcing them back to the city. Hector chooses to remain outside the gates of Troy to face Achilles, partly because had he listened to Polydamas and retreated with his troops the previous night, Achilles would not have killed so many Trojans. When he sees Achilles, however, Hector is seized by fear and turns to flee. Achilles chases him around the city three times before Hector masters his fear and turns to face Achilles. But Athena, in the disguise of Hector's brother [[Deiphobus]], has deluded Hector. He requests from Achilles that the victor should return the other's body after the duel, (though Hector himself made it clear he planned to throw the body of Patroclus to the dogs) but Achilles refuses. Achilles hurls his spear at Hector, who dodges it, but Athena brings it back to Achilles' hands without Hector noticing. Hector then throws his own spear at Achilles; it hits his shield and does no injury. When Hector turns to face his supposed brother to retrieve another spear, he sees no one there. At that moment he realizes that he is doomed. Hector decides that he will go down fighting and that men will talk about his bravery in years to come. The desire to achieve ever-lasting honor was one of the most fierce for soldiers living in the timocratic (honor-based) society of the age.\n\n[[File:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in [[Troy]]. (A [[fresco]] in the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]], [[Corfu]])]]\nHector pulls out his sword, now his only weapon, and charges. But Achilles grabbed his thrown spears that were delivered to him by the unseen Athena who wore the Hades helmet. Achilles then aimed his spear and pierced the collar bone section of Hector, the only part of the stolen Armor of Achilles that did not protect Hector. The wound was fatal yet allowed Hector to speak to Achilles. In his final moments, Hector begs Achilles for an honorable funeral, but Achilles replies that he will let the dogs and vultures devour Hector's flesh. (Throughout the Homeric poems, several references are made to dogs, vultures, and other creatures that devour the dead. It can be seen as another way of saying one will die.) Hector dies, prophesying that Achilles' death will follow soon:\n\n<blockquote>Be careful now; for I might be made into the gods' curse ... upon you, on that day when Paris and [[Phoibos]] Apollo...destroy you in the Skainan gates, for all your valor.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Iliad|last = Lattimore|first = Richmond|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-226-47049-8|location = |page = 467}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter his death, Achilles slits Hector's heels and passes the girdle that Ajax had given Hector through the slits. He then fastens the girdle to his chariot and drives his fallen enemy through the dust to the [[Danaan]] camp. For the next twelve days, Achilles mistreats the body, but it remains preserved from all injury by [[Apollo]] and [[Aphrodite]]. After these twelve days, the gods can no longer stand watching it and send down two messengers: [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], another messenger god, and Thetis, the mother of Achilles. Thetis has told Achilles to allow King Priam to come and take the body for ransom. Once King Priam has been notified that Achilles will allow him to claim the body, he goes to his strongroom to withdraw the ransom. The ransom King Priam offers includes twelve fine robes, twelve white mantles, several richly embroidered tunics, ten bars of yellow gold, a special gold cup, and several cauldrons. Priam himself goes to claim his son's body, and Hermes grants him safe passage by casting a charm that will make anyone who looks at him fall asleep.\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThink of thy father, and this helpless face behold\nSee him in me, as helpless and as old!\nThough not so wretched: there he yields to me,\nThe first of men in sovereign misery!\nThus forced to kneel, thus groveling to embrace\nThe scourge and ruin of my realm and race;\nSuppliant my children\u2019s murderer to implore,\nAnd kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!\n</poem>\n|cite=Spoken by [[Priam]] to [[Achilles]]; ''Iliad'', Book XXIV, [[Alexander Pope|Pope's]] translation}}\n\nAchilles, moved by Priam's actions and following his mother's orders sent by Zeus, returns Hector's body to Priam and promises him a truce of twelve days to allow the Trojans to perform funeral rites for Hector. Priam returns to Troy with the body of his son, and it is given full funeral honors. Even Helen mourns Hector, for he had always been kind to her and protected her from spite. The last lines of the ''Iliad'' are dedicated to Hector's funeral. Homer concludes by referring to the Trojan prince as the \"Breaker of Horses.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Pseudo-Apollodorus |title=[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]] |at=III, xii, 5\u20136; \"Epitome\" IV, 2}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the dead Hector appears to Aeneas in a dream urging him to flee Troy.<ref>https://news.ku.edu/2015/05/22/were-some-dreams-ancient-roman-poetry-precursor-film</ref>\n\n==Historical references==\nThe most valuable historical evidence for the Battle of Troy are treaties and letters mentioned in [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[cuneiform]] [[Hittite texts#New Kingdom|texts]] of the same approximate era, which mention an unruly Western Anatolian warlord named ''[[Piyama-Radu]]'' (possibly Priam) and his successor ''[[Alaksandu]]'' (possibly Alexander, the nickname of [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]) both based in ''[[Wilusa]]'' (possibly [[Troy|Ilion/Ilios]]), as well as the god ''Apaliunas'' (possibly [[Apollo]]).\n\nOther such pieces of evidence are names of Trojan heroes in [[Linear B]] tablets.

He was married to [[Andromache]], with whom he had an infant son, [[Scamandrius]] (whom the people of Troy called [[Astyanax]]).\n\nDuring the European Middle Ages, Hector figures as one of the [[Nine Worthies]] noted by [[Jacques de Longuyon]], known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, [[Homer]] places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. [[James M. Redfield|James Redfield]] describes Hector as a \"martyr to loyalties, a witness to the things of this world, a hero ready to die for the precious imperfections of ordinary life.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=James M. |last=Redfield |title=Nature and Culture in the Iliad: The Tragedy of Hector |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |date=1994 |page=ix}}</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n\n===Greatest warrior of Troy===\n\n[[File:Hektor wirft Paris seine Weichlichkeit vor (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|250px|''Hector Admonishes Paris for His Softness and Exhorts Him to Go to War'' by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|J. H. W. Tischbein]] (1751\u20131828)]]\n\nAccording to the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector did not approve of war between the [[Greeks]] and the Trojans.\n\nFor ten years, the Achaeans besieged Troy and their allies in the east. Hector commanded the Trojan army, with a number of subordinates including [[Polydamas (Iliad)|Polydamas]], and his brothers [[Deiphobus]], [[Helenus]] and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. By all accounts, Hector was the best warrior the Trojans and their allies could field, and his fighting prowess was admired by Greeks and his own people alike.\n\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]], when faced with his attack, described him as what [[Robert Fagles]] translated as an 'incredible dynamite' and a 'maniac'.\n\n====Duel with Protesilaus====\nIn the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector's exploits in the war prior to the events of the book are recapitulated. He had fought the Greek champion [[Protesilaus]] in single combat at the start of the war and killed him. A prophecy had stated that the first Greek to land on Trojan soil would die. Thus, [[Protesilaus]], [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]], and [[Odysseus]] would not land. Finally, Odysseus threw his shield out and landed on that, and Protesilaus jumped next from his own ship. In the ensuing fight, Hector killed him, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n[[File:Ajax and Hector exchange gifts.jpg|250px|thumb|Ajax and Hector exchange gifts ([[woodcut]] in [[Andrea Alciato|Andreas Alciatus]], ''Emblematum libellus'', 1591).]]\n\n====Duel with Ajax====\nAs described by Homer in the Iliad<ref>''Iliad'', VII 43\u2013305.</ref> at the advice of Hector\u2019s brother [[Helenus]] (who also was divinely inspired) and being told by him that he was not destined to die yet, Hector managed to get both armies seated and challenged any one of the Greek warriors to [[single combat]]. The [[Argives]] were initially reluctant to accept the challenge. However, after [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]'s chiding, nine Greek [[hero]]es stepped up to the challenge and drew by lot to see who was to face Hector. [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] won and fought Hector. Hector was unable to pierce Ajax's famous shield, but Ajax crushed Hector's shield with a rock and stabbed through his armor with a spear, drawing blood, upon which the god Apollo intervened and the duel was ended as the sun was setting. Hector gave Ajax his sword, which Ajax later used to kill himself. Ajax gave Hector his girdle that Achilles later attached to his chariot to drag Hector's corpse around the walls of Troy.\n\nThe Greeks and the Trojans made a truce to bury the dead. In the early dawn the next day, the Greeks took advantage of the truce to build a wall and ditch around the ships while Zeus watched in the distance.<ref>''Iliad'', VII, 433 ''ff.''</ref>\n\n====Duel with Achilles====\nAnother mention of Hector's exploits in the early years of war was given in the [[Iliad]] in book IX. During the embassy to [[Achilles]], Odysseus, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]] and [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] all try to persuade Achilles to rejoin the fight. In his response, Achilles points out that while Hector was terrorizing the Greek forces now, and that while he himself had fought in their front lines, Hector had 'no wish' to take his force far beyond the walls and out from the Skiaian Gate and nearby oak tree. He then claims, 'There he stood up to me alone one day, and he barely escaped my onslaught.'\nAnother duel that took place, although Hector received help from [[Aeneas]] (his cousin<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aeneas</ref>) and Deiphobus, was when Hector rushed to try to save his brother Troilus from Achilles' hands. But he came too late and Troilus had already perished. All Hector could do was to take the lifeless body of Troilus while Achilles escaped after he fought his way through from the Trojans reinforcement.\n\n[[File:Hector Astyanax MN Jatta.jpg|thumb|250px|Hector's last visit with his wife, [[Andromache]], and infant son [[Astyanax]], startled by his father's helmet ([[Apulian vase painting|Apulian red-figure vase]], 370\u2013360 BC)]]\n\nIn the tenth year of the war, observing [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] avoiding combat with [[Menelaus]], Hector upbraids him with having brought trouble on his whole country and now refusing to fight. Paris therefore proposes [[single combat]] between himself and Menelaus, with [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] to go to the victor, ending the war.<ref>''Iliad'', III.</ref> The duel, however, leads to inconclusive results due to intervention by [[Aphrodite]] who leads Paris off the field. After [[Pandarus]]  wounds [[Menelaus]] with an arrow the fight begins again.\n\nThe Greeks attack and drive the Trojans back. Hector must now go out to lead a counter-attack. According to Homer<ref>Iliad, VI 390\u2013480</ref> his wife [[Andromache]], carrying in her arms her son [[Astyanax]], intercepts Hector at the gate, pleading with him not to go out for her sake as well as his son's. Hector knows that Troy and the house of Priam are doomed to fall and that the gloomy fate of his wife and infant son will be to die or go into slavery in a foreign land. With understanding, compassion, and tenderness he explains that he cannot personally refuse to fight, and comforts her with the idea that no one can take him until it is his time to go. The gleaming bronze helmet frightens Astyanax and makes him cry.<ref>This Trojan helmet was made famous by Denys L. Page in ''History and the Homeric Iliad'', Chapter VI, \"Some Mycenaean relics in the Iliad\", as the Greeks do not wear bronze helmets in the poem's [[Oral-formulaic composition|epic formulae]], but they did in the Homeric Age; therefore, scholar Denys L. Page concludes (on other evidence as well) that the bronze helmet of Hector descends in oral poetry from [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times.</ref> Hector takes it off, embraces his wife and son, and for his sake prays aloud to [[Zeus]] that his son might be chief after him, become more glorious in battle than he, to bring home the blood of his enemies, and make his mother proud. Once he left for battle, those in the house began to mourn as they knew he would not return. Hector and Paris pass through the gate and rally the Trojans, raising havoc among the Greeks.\n\n===Trojan counter-attack===\nZeus [[Weighing of souls|weighs the fates]] of the two armies in the balance, and that of the Greeks sinks down. The Trojans press the Greeks into their camp over the ditch and wall and would have laid hands on the ships, but [[Agamemnon]] rallies the Greeks in person. The Trojans are driven off, night falls, and Hector resolves to take the camp and burn the ships the next day. The Trojans bivouac in the field.\n{{quote|A thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain ....<ref>''Iliad'', VIII, 542 ''ff.''</ref>}}\n\nThe next day Agamemnon rallies the Greeks and drives the Trojans\n{{quote|like a herd of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them ...<ref>''Iliad'', XI, 171 ''ff.''</ref>}}\nHector refrains from battle until Agamemnon leaves the field, wounded in the arm by a spear. Then Hector rallies the Trojans:\n{{quote|... like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea ...|sign=|source=}}\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]] hinder Hector and win the Greeks some time to retreat, but the Trojans sweep down upon the wall and rain blows upon it. The Greeks in the camp contest the gates to secure entrance for their fleeing warriors. The Trojans try to pull down the ramparts while the Greeks rain arrows upon them. Hector smashes open a gate with a large stone, clears the gate and calls on the Trojans to scale the wall, which they do, and\n{{quote|... all was uproar and confusion.<ref>''Iliad'', XII.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:THAM-Battle at the ships sarcophagus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle at the ships, on a [[Roman Empire|Roman-era]] [[sarcophagus]], 225\u2013250 AD]]\n\nThe battle rages inside the camp. Hector goes down, hit by a stone thrown by Ajax, but [[Apollo]] arrives from Olympus and infuses strength into \"the shepherd of the people\", who orders a chariot attack, with Apollo clearing the way. Many combats, deaths, boasts, threats, epithets, figures of speech, stories, lines of poetry and books of the Iliad later, Hector lays hold of [[Protesilaus]]' ship and calls for fire. The Trojans cannot bring it to him, as Ajax kills everyone who tries. Eventually, Hector breaks Ajax' spear with his sword, forcing him to give ground, and he sets the ship afire.<ref>''Iliad'', XV, end.</ref>\n\nThese events are all according to the will of the gods, who have decreed the fall of Troy, and therefore intend to tempt Achilles back into the war. [[Patroclus]], Achilles' closest companion, disguised in the armor of [[Achilles]], enters the combat leading the [[Myrmidons]] and the rest of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] to force a Trojan withdrawal. After Patroclus has routed the Trojan army, Hector, with the aid of [[Apollo]] and [[Euphorbus]], kills Patroclus, vaunting over him:\n{{quote|\"Wretch! Achilleus, great as he was, could do nothing to help you.\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\">The Iliad, book XVI</ref>}}\nThe dying Patroclus foretells Hector's death:\n{{quote|\"You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already death and powerful destiny are standing beside you, to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\" />}}\n\n===Hector's last fight===\n\n{{quote|Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. ... death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it \u2013 for so [[Zeus]] and his son [[Apollo]] the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.|cite=Spoken by Hector facing [[Achilles]], after a missed spear-throw; ''Iliad'', Book XXII, lines 299\u2013305}}\n\nHector strips the armor of Achilles off the fallen Patroclus and gives it to his men to take back to the city. Glaucus accuses Hector of cowardice for not challenging Ajax. Stung, Hector calls for the armor, puts it on, and uses it to rally the Trojans.  [[Zeus]] regards the donning of a hero's armor as an act of insolence by a fool about to die, but it makes Hector strong for now.<ref>''Iliad'', XVII</ref>\n\nThe next day, the enraged Achilles renounces the wrath that kept him out of action and routs the Trojans, forcing them back to the city. Hector chooses to remain outside the gates of Troy to face Achilles, partly because had he listened to Polydamas and retreated with his troops the previous night, Achilles would not have killed so many Trojans. When he sees Achilles, however, Hector is seized by fear and turns to flee. Achilles chases him around the city three times before Hector masters his fear and turns to face Achilles. But Athena, in the disguise of Hector's brother [[Deiphobus]], has deluded Hector. He requests from Achilles that the victor should return the other's body after the duel, (though Hector himself made it clear he planned to throw the body of Patroclus to the dogs) but Achilles refuses. Achilles hurls his spear at Hector, who dodges it, but Athena brings it back to Achilles' hands without Hector noticing. Hector then throws his own spear at Achilles; it hits his shield and does no injury. When Hector turns to face his supposed brother to retrieve another spear, he sees no one there. At that moment he realizes that he is doomed. Hector decides that he will go down fighting and that men will talk about his bravery in years to come. The desire to achieve ever-lasting honor was one of the most fierce for soldiers living in the timocratic (honor-based) society of the age.\n\n[[File:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in [[Troy]]. (A [[fresco]] in the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]], [[Corfu]])]]\nHector pulls out his sword, now his only weapon, and charges. But Achilles grabbed his thrown spears that were delivered to him by the unseen Athena who wore the Hades helmet. Achilles then aimed his spear and pierced the collar bone section of Hector, the only part of the stolen Armor of Achilles that did not protect Hector. The wound was fatal yet allowed Hector to speak to Achilles. In his final moments, Hector begs Achilles for an honorable funeral, but Achilles replies that he will let the dogs and vultures devour Hector's flesh. (Throughout the Homeric poems, several references are made to dogs, vultures, and other creatures that devour the dead. It can be seen as another way of saying one will die.) Hector dies, prophesying that Achilles' death will follow soon:\n\n<blockquote>Be careful now; for I might be made into the gods' curse ... upon you, on that day when Paris and [[Phoibos]] Apollo...destroy you in the Skainan gates, for all your valor.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Iliad|last = Lattimore|first = Richmond|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-226-47049-8|location = |page = 467}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter his death, Achilles slits Hector's heels and passes the girdle that Ajax had given Hector through the slits. He then fastens the girdle to his chariot and drives his fallen enemy through the dust to the [[Danaan]] camp. For the next twelve days, Achilles mistreats the body, but it remains preserved from all injury by [[Apollo]] and [[Aphrodite]]. After these twelve days, the gods can no longer stand watching it and send down two messengers: [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], another messenger god, and Thetis, the mother of Achilles. Thetis has told Achilles to allow King Priam to come and take the body for ransom. Once King Priam has been notified that Achilles will allow him to claim the body, he goes to his strongroom to withdraw the ransom. The ransom King Priam offers includes twelve fine robes, twelve white mantles, several richly embroidered tunics, ten bars of yellow gold, a special gold cup, and several cauldrons. Priam himself goes to claim his son's body, and Hermes grants him safe passage by casting a charm that will make anyone who looks at him fall asleep.\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThink of thy father, and this helpless face behold\nSee him in me, as helpless and as old!\nThough not so wretched: there he yields to me,\nThe first of men in sovereign misery!\nThus forced to kneel, thus groveling to embrace\nThe scourge and ruin of my realm and race;\nSuppliant my children\u2019s murderer to implore,\nAnd kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!\n</poem>\n|cite=Spoken by [[Priam]] to [[Achilles]]; ''Iliad'', Book XXIV, [[Alexander Pope|Pope's]] translation}}\n\nAchilles, moved by Priam's actions and following his mother's orders sent by Zeus, returns Hector's body to Priam and promises him a truce of twelve days to allow the Trojans to perform funeral rites for Hector. Priam returns to Troy with the body of his son, and it is given full funeral honors. Even Helen mourns Hector, for he had always been kind to her and protected her from spite. The last lines of the ''Iliad'' are dedicated to Hector's funeral. Homer concludes by referring to the Trojan prince as the \"Breaker of Horses.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Pseudo-Apollodorus |title=[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]] |at=III, xii, 5\u20136; \"Epitome\" IV, 2}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the dead Hector appears to Aeneas in a dream urging him to flee Troy.<ref>https://news.ku.edu/2015/05/22/were-some-dreams-ancient-roman-poetry-precursor-film</ref>\n\n==Historical references==\nThe most valuable historical evidence for the Battle of Troy are treaties and letters mentioned in [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[cuneiform]] [[Hittite texts#New Kingdom|texts]] of the same approximate era, which mention an unruly Western Anatolian warlord named ''[[Piyama-Radu]]'' (possibly Priam) and his successor ''[[Alaksandu]]'' (possibly Alexander, the nickname of [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]) both based in ''[[Wilusa]]'' (possibly [[Troy|Ilion/Ilios]]), as well as the god ''Apaliunas'' (possibly [[Apollo]]).\n\nOther such pieces of evidence are names of Trojan heroes in [[Linear B]] tablets.

The [[Oslo Accords]] led to a vote of confidence, which the Government won with a margin of 61\u201350 (8 abstained). Several MKs from the Government parties declined to support the Government, but on the other hand, the Arab parties came to its rescue. Due to the lack of a constitution in Israel, the Government was able to implement the accords with a thin margin.\n\nRabin's decision to advance peace talks with the Palestinians to the point of signing the [[Oslo Accords]] led to his [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|assassination]] by [[Yigal Amir]] in 1995. Peres decided to call early elections in 1996 to give him a mandate for advancing the peace process. However, his ploy failed; although Labor won the most seats in the [[1996 Israeli legislative election|Knesset election]], he lost to the [[1996 Israeli prime ministerial election|election for Prime Minister]] to [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] following a wave of [[suicide bombing]]s by [[Hamas]]. Netanyahu and Likud were thus able to form the government.\n\nWith his coalition falling apart, Netanyahu decided to call early elections in 1999. [[Ehud Barak]] won the internal primaries, and was nominated as the Labor candidate for Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the party entered an electoral alliance with [[Meimad]] and [[Gesher (political party)|Gesher]] called [[One Israel]]. Barak won the [[1999 Israeli prime ministerial election|Prime Minister election]], whilst One Israel won the [[1999 Israeli legislative election|Knesset elections]], albeit with only 26 seats.\n\nBarak started by forming a 75-member coalition together with [[Shas]], [[Meretz-Yachad|Meretz]], [[Yisrael BaAliyah]], the [[National Religious Party]] and [[United Torah Judaism]]. The coalition with religious parties (NRP, Shas and UTJ) caused tensions with the [[secularism|secularist]] Meretz, who quit the coalition after a disagreement with Shas over the authority of the Deputy Education Minister. The rest of the parties left before the [[Camp David 2000 summit]].\n\n===Decline since 2001===\nFollowing the [[October 2000 riots]] and the violence of the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]], Barak resigned from office. He then lost a [[2001 Israeli prime ministerial election|special election for Prime Minister]] to [[Likud]]'s [[Ariel Sharon]]. However, Labor remained in Sharon's coalition as he formed a [[national unity government]] with Likud, Labor, Shas, Yisrael BaAliyah and United Torah Judaism, and were given two of the most important cabinet portfolios; Peres was appointed [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and [[Benjamin Ben-Eliezer]] was made [[List of Defense Ministers of Israel|Defense Minister]]. Labor supported [[Operation Defensive Shield]], which was conducted in April 2002 against Palestinians in the [[West Bank]]. After harsh criticism that Peres and Ben-Elizer were \"puppets\" of Sharon and not promoting the peace process, Labor quit the government in 2003.\n\nPrior to the [[2003 Israeli legislative election|2003 elections]], [[Amram Mitzna]] won the party primaries, and led the party into the election with a platform that included unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. The party was routed in the elections, winning only 19 seats (its lowest ever), whilst Sharon's Likud won 38 (40 after [[Yisrael BaAliyah]] merged into the party). Subsequently, due to internal opposition, Mitzna resigned from the party leadership,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-2608896,00.html |title=Mitzna's resignation speech |publisher=Ynet.co.il |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> and soon afterwards was replaced by Shimon Peres. Despite being omitted from the original right-wing coalition, Sharon invited Labor into the coalition to shore up support for the [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|disengagement plan]] (effectively Mitzna's policy which he had earlier lambasted) after the [[National Union (Israel)|National Union]] and the [[National Religious Party]] had left the government.\n\nOn 8 November 2005, Shimon Peres was replaced as the leader of the Labor party by the election of left-wing Histadrut union leader [[Amir Peretz]] in an internal Labor party ballot. Critics of Labor have argued that, over the years, the party had abandoned its [[socialism|socialist]] heritage in favor of economic and business elites, and had passed the mantle of custodian of the underprivileged to right-wing and religious parties.<ref name=persp>Efraim Inbar: \"[http://www.biu.ac.il/SOC/besa/perspectives70.html The Decline of the Israel Labor Party]\" Perspectives Papers on Current Affairs, ''Perspectives'' 70, 23 February 2009.</ref> Peretz stated his intention to reassert Labor's traditional socialist policies, and took the party out of the government. This prompted Sharon to resign and call for new [[2006 Israeli legislative election|elections in March 2006]]. Prior to the election, the political map had been redrawn, as Sharon and the majority of Likud's MKs, together with a number of Labor MKs, including Shimon Peres, and some from other parties, had formed the new political party [[Kadima]]. In the elections Labor won 19 seats, making it the second largest party after Kadima. It joined [[Ehud Olmert]]'s Kadima-led government, with Peretz appointed Defense Minister. Labor's main coalition demand and campaign promise was raising the minimum wage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1143498864586|title=Kadima, Labor talks 'making progress'|publisher=|access-date=27 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121063539/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1143498864586&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|archive-date=21 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 May 2007 a leadership election resulted in Ehud Barak and Ami Ayalon defeating Peretz who was pushed into third place. In the [[Two-round system|run-off election]] (required as neither Barak nor Ayalon received over 40% of the vote), Barak was re-elected as party chairman. Despite stating that he would withdraw the party from the government unless Olmert resigned,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6699993.stm Israel party votes to oust leader] BBC News, 29 May 2007</ref> Barak remained in government and took over as Defense Minister.\n\nPrior to the [[2009 Israeli legislative election|2009 elections]] Labor and Meimad ended their alliance, with Meimad ultimately running a joint list with the [[Green Movement (Israel)|Green Movement]] (which did not pass the electoral threshold). Several prominent members left the party, including [[Ami Ayalon]], and [[Efraim Sneh]] (who formed [[Yisrael Hazaka]]). In the elections, Labor was reduced to just 13 seats, making it the fourth largest party behind Kadima, Likud and [[Yisrael Beiteinu]].\n\nAnalysing the downfall of the once dominant political party in Israel, Efraim Inbar of the [[Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies]] points to several factors. By forfeiting identification with the establishment and building of the State of Israel, symbolised by a predilection for military service and by the settling of the land of Israel, Labor lost its most important asset. Deserting the Zionist symbol of Jerusalem, by showing willingness to cede part of it to the Palestinians was an ill-fated move. When cosmopolitan and individualist values made inroads into the party, it distanced itself from the collectivist ethos that has been dominant and is still widespread in Israel. Their association with the [[Oslo Accords]] meant that they could not avoid being discredited by its failure. Demographic factors have worked against Labor, as the growing [[Sephardi Jews|Sefardi]] population, as well as the recent Russian-Jewish immigrants, have largely voted for other parties. Attempts to gain the support of the [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arab]] voters have damaged the image of the party, and yielded no harvest.<ref name=persp/>\n\n[[File:Israeli Labor seat decline.png|thumb|Seats held by the Labor party since its founding.]]\n\nOn 17 January 2011, disillusionment with party leader Ehud Barak, over his support for coalition policies, especially regarding the peace process, led to Barak's resignation from the Labor Party with four other Knesset members to establish a new \"centrist, Zionist and democratic\" party, [[Independence (Israeli political party)|Independence]]. Following this move, all Labor Party government ministers resigned.\n\nTwo days after the split, a group of prominent members of Israel's business, technology, and cultural communities including [[Jerusalem Venture Partners]] founder [[Erel Margalit]] founded the \"Avoda Now\" movement calling for a revival of the Labor Party. The movement launched a public campaign calling the people to support the Labor party, with the aim of renewing its institutions, restore its social values, and choose new dynamic leadership.<ref>{{cite news<!--|title=PR Newswire-->|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/27/idUS272092+27-Apr-2011+PRN20110427|title=Erel Margalit Announces His Candidacy to Lead the Labor Party|agency=Reuters|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=8 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Shelly Yachimovich]] was elected leader in 2011 saying \"I promise that we will work together.

The [[Oslo Accords]] led to a vote of confidence, which the Government won with a margin of 61\u201350 (8 abstained). Several MKs from the Government parties declined to support the Government, but on the other hand, the Arab parties came to its rescue. Due to the lack of a constitution in Israel, the Government was able to implement the accords with a thin margin.\n\nRabin's decision to advance peace talks with the Palestinians to the point of signing the [[Oslo Accords]] led to his [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|assassination]] by [[Yigal Amir]] in 1995. Peres decided to call early elections in 1996 to give him a mandate for advancing the peace process. However, his ploy failed; although Labor won the most seats in the [[1996 Israeli legislative election|Knesset election]], he lost to the [[1996 Israeli prime ministerial election|election for Prime Minister]] to [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] following a wave of [[suicide bombing]]s by [[Hamas]]. Netanyahu and Likud were thus able to form the government.\n\nWith his coalition falling apart, Netanyahu decided to call early elections in 1999. [[Ehud Barak]] won the internal primaries, and was nominated as the Labor candidate for Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the party entered an electoral alliance with [[Meimad]] and [[Gesher (political party)|Gesher]] called [[One Israel]]. Barak won the [[1999 Israeli prime ministerial election|Prime Minister election]], whilst One Israel won the [[1999 Israeli legislative election|Knesset elections]], albeit with only 26 seats.\n\nBarak started by forming a 75-member coalition together with [[Shas]], [[Meretz-Yachad|Meretz]], [[Yisrael BaAliyah]], the [[National Religious Party]] and [[United Torah Judaism]]. The coalition with religious parties (NRP, Shas and UTJ) caused tensions with the [[secularism|secularist]] Meretz, who quit the coalition after a disagreement with Shas over the authority of the Deputy Education Minister. The rest of the parties left before the [[Camp David 2000 summit]].\n\n===Decline since 2001===\nFollowing the [[October 2000 riots]] and the violence of the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]], Barak resigned from office. He then lost a [[2001 Israeli prime ministerial election|special election for Prime Minister]] to [[Likud]]'s [[Ariel Sharon]]. However, Labor remained in Sharon's coalition as he formed a [[national unity government]] with Likud, Labor, Shas, Yisrael BaAliyah and United Torah Judaism, and were given two of the most important cabinet portfolios; Peres was appointed [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and [[Benjamin Ben-Eliezer]] was made [[List of Defense Ministers of Israel|Defense Minister]]. Labor supported [[Operation Defensive Shield]], which was conducted in April 2002 against Palestinians in the [[West Bank]]. After harsh criticism that Peres and Ben-Elizer were \"puppets\" of Sharon and not promoting the peace process, Labor quit the government in 2003.\n\nPrior to the [[2003 Israeli legislative election|2003 elections]], [[Amram Mitzna]] won the party primaries, and led the party into the election with a platform that included unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. The party was routed in the elections, winning only 19 seats (its lowest ever), whilst Sharon's Likud won 38 (40 after [[Yisrael BaAliyah]] merged into the party). Subsequently, due to internal opposition, Mitzna resigned from the party leadership,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-2608896,00.html |title=Mitzna's resignation speech |publisher=Ynet.co.il |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> and soon afterwards was replaced by Shimon Peres. Despite being omitted from the original right-wing coalition, Sharon invited Labor into the coalition to shore up support for the [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|disengagement plan]] (effectively Mitzna's policy which he had earlier lambasted) after the [[National Union (Israel)|National Union]] and the [[National Religious Party]] had left the government.\n\nOn 8 November 2005, Shimon Peres was replaced as the leader of the Labor party by the election of left-wing Histadrut union leader [[Amir Peretz]] in an internal Labor party ballot. Critics of Labor have argued that, over the years, the party had abandoned its [[socialism|socialist]] heritage in favor of economic and business elites, and had passed the mantle of custodian of the underprivileged to right-wing and religious parties.<ref name=persp>Efraim Inbar: \"[http://www.biu.ac.il/SOC/besa/perspectives70.html The Decline of the Israel Labor Party]\" Perspectives Papers on Current Affairs, ''Perspectives'' 70, 23 February 2009.</ref> Peretz stated his intention to reassert Labor's traditional socialist policies, and took the party out of the government. This prompted Sharon to resign and call for new [[2006 Israeli legislative election|elections in March 2006]]. Prior to the election, the political map had been redrawn, as Sharon and the majority of Likud's MKs, together with a number of Labor MKs, including Shimon Peres, and some from other parties, had formed the new political party [[Kadima]]. In the elections Labor won 19 seats, making it the second largest party after Kadima. It joined [[Ehud Olmert]]'s Kadima-led government, with Peretz appointed Defense Minister. Labor's main coalition demand and campaign promise was raising the minimum wage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1143498864586|title=Kadima, Labor talks 'making progress'|publisher=|access-date=27 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121063539/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1143498864586&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|archive-date=21 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 May 2007 a leadership election resulted in Ehud Barak and Ami Ayalon defeating Peretz who was pushed into third place. In the [[Two-round system|run-off election]] (required as neither Barak nor Ayalon received over 40% of the vote), Barak was re-elected as party chairman. Despite stating that he would withdraw the party from the government unless Olmert resigned,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6699993.stm Israel party votes to oust leader] BBC News, 29 May 2007</ref> Barak remained in government and took over as Defense Minister.\n\nPrior to the [[2009 Israeli legislative election|2009 elections]] Labor and Meimad ended their alliance, with Meimad ultimately running a joint list with the [[Green Movement (Israel)|Green Movement]] (which did not pass the electoral threshold). Several prominent members left the party, including [[Ami Ayalon]], and [[Efraim Sneh]] (who formed [[Yisrael Hazaka]]). In the elections, Labor was reduced to just 13 seats, making it the fourth largest party behind Kadima, Likud and [[Yisrael Beiteinu]].\n\nAnalysing the downfall of the once dominant political party in Israel, Efraim Inbar of the [[Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies]] points to several factors. By forfeiting identification with the establishment and building of the State of Israel, symbolised by a predilection for military service and by the settling of the land of Israel, Labor lost its most important asset. Deserting the Zionist symbol of Jerusalem, by showing willingness to cede part of it to the Palestinians was an ill-fated move. When cosmopolitan and individualist values made inroads into the party, it distanced itself from the collectivist ethos that has been dominant and is still widespread in Israel. Their association with the [[Oslo Accords]] meant that they could not avoid being discredited by its failure. Demographic factors have worked against Labor, as the growing [[Sephardi Jews|Sefardi]] population, as well as the recent Russian-Jewish immigrants, have largely voted for other parties. Attempts to gain the support of the [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arab]] voters have damaged the image of the party, and yielded no harvest.<ref name=persp/>\n\n[[File:Israeli Labor seat decline.png|thumb|Seats held by the Labor party since its founding.]]\n\nOn 17 January 2011, disillusionment with party leader Ehud Barak, over his support for coalition policies, especially regarding the peace process, led to Barak's resignation from the Labor Party with four other Knesset members to establish a new \"centrist, Zionist and democratic\" party, [[Independence (Israeli political party)|Independence]].

These letters were from a provincial official, [[Il\u012b-ippa\u0161ra]], in Dilmun to his friend Enlil-kidinni in Mesopotamia. The names referred to are [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. These letters and other documents, hint at an administrative relationship between Dilmun and [[Babylon]] at that time. Following the collapse of the Kassite dynasty, Mesopotamian documents make no mention of Dilmun with the exception of Assyrian inscriptions dated to 1250 BC which proclaimed the Assyrian king to be king of Dilmun and [[Meluhha]]. Assyrian inscriptions recorded tribute from Dilmun. There are other Assyrian inscriptions during the first millennium BC indicating Assyrian sovereignty over Dilmun.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=50-51}} Dilmun was also later on controlled by the [[Kassite dynasty]] in Mesopotamia.<ref name=t>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6KeP3v79MQC&pg=PA216&dq|title=Traces of Paradise: The Archaeology of Bahrain, 2500 BC to 300 AD|work= Harriet Crawford, Michael Rice |year= 2000 |pages=217}}</ref>\n\nOne of the early sites discovered in Bahrain indicate that [[Sennacherib]], king of Assyria (707\u2013681 BC), attacked northeast Persian Gulf and captured Bahrain.<ref name=\"Mojtahed-Zadeh\">{{cite book|title=Security and Territoriality in the Persian Gulf: A Maritime Political Geography|last=Mojtahed-Zadeh |first=Pirouz |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=Curzon |location=Richmond, Surrey |isbn=0700710981}}</ref>{{pn|date=May 2017}} The most recent reference to Dilmun came during the [[Neo-Babylon]]ian dynasty.

Impressions of clay seals from the Indus Valley city of [[Harappa]] were evidently used to seal bundles of merchandise, as clay seal impressions with cord or sack marks on the reverse side testify. A number of these Indus Valley seals have turned up at [[Ur]] and other Mesopotamian sites.\n\nThe \u201cPersian Gulf\u201d types of circular, stamped (rather than rolled) seals known from Dilmun, that appear at [[Lothal]] in [[Gujarat]], India, and [[Failaka]], as well as in Mesopotamia, are convincing corroboration of the long-distance sea trade. What the commerce consisted of is less known: timber and precious woods, [[ivory]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[gold]], and luxury goods such as [[carnelian]] and glazed stone beads, [[pearl]]s from the Persian Gulf, shell and bone inlays, were among the goods sent to Mesopotamia in exchange for [[silver]], [[tin]], woolen textiles, olive oil and grains. [[Copper]] ingots from Oman and [[bitumen]] which occurred naturally in Mesopotamia may have been exchanged for cotton textiles and domestic fowl, major products of the Indus region that are not native to Mesopotamia. Instances of all of these trade goods have been found. The importance of this trade is shown by the fact that the weights and measures used at Dilmun were in fact identical to those used by the Indus, and were not those used in Southern Mesopotamia.\n\n:\u201c''the ships of Dilmun, from the foreign land, brought him wood as a tribute''\u201d.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=33}}\n\nMesopotamian trade documents, lists of goods, and official inscriptions mentioning Meluhha supplement Harappan seals and archaeological finds. Literary references to Meluhhan trade date from the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian, the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], and [[Isin]]-[[Larsa]] Periods (c. 2350 \u2013 1800 BC), but the trade probably started in the Early Dynastic Period (c. 2600 BC). Some Meluhhan vessels may have sailed directly to Mesopotamian ports, but by the Isin-Larsa Period, Dilmun monopolized the trade. The [[Bahrain National Museum]] assesses that its \"Golden Age\" lasted from c. 2200 BC to 1600 BC.

Eastern Arabians were amongst the first to embrace Islam during the time of the [[Prophets and messengers of Islam|Islamic ''Nabi'']] ([[Prophet]]) [[Muhammad]], who ruled eastern Arabia through one of his representatives, [[Al-Ala'a Al-Hadhrami]]. Eastern Arabia embraced Islam in 629 (the seventh year of ''Hijrah''). During the time of [[Umar]] I the [[Sahaba|companion]] of Mohammad, [[Abu Hurairah]], was the governor of eastern Arabia. Umar I also appointed [[Uthman bin Abu al-As]] as governor of the area. [[Al Khamis Mosque]], founded in 692, was one of the earliest [[mosque]]s built in eastern Arabia, in the era of [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Umar II]].\n\nThe expansion of Islam did not affect eastern Arabia's reliance on trade, and its prosperity continued to be dependent on markets in India and Mesopotamia. After [[Baghdad]] emerged as the seat of the [[caliph]] in 750 and the main centre of Islamic civilization, eastern Arabia greatly benefited from the city's increased demand for foreign goods especially from China and South Asia.\n\nEastern Arabia, specifically Bahrain, became a principal centre of knowledge for hundreds of years stretching from the early days of Islam in the 6th century to the 18th century. Philosophers of eastern Arabia were highly esteemed, such as the 13th-century mystic, Sheikh [[Maitham Al Bahrani]] (died in 1299) (The mosque of Sheikh Maitham and his tomb can be visited in the outskirts of the capital, [[Manama]], near the district of [[Mahooz]]).\n\n====Qarmatian Republic====\n{{Main|Qarmatians}}\n[[File:Eastern & Central Arabia 9th\u201310th Centuries.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of eastern and central Arabia in the 9th\u201310th centuries]]\n\nIn the end of the 3rd [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] century, Abu Sa'id al-Hasan al-Janaby led the [[Revolution of al-Qaramita]], a rebellion by a [[messiah|messianic]] [[Ismaili]] sect originating in [[Kufa]] in present-day Iraq. Al-Janaby took over the city of Hajr, Bahrain's capital at that time, and Al-Hasa, which he made the capital of his republic. Once in control of the state he sought to create a [[utopian]] society.\n\nThe Qarmatians' goal was to build a society based on reason and equality. The state was governed by a council of six with a chief who was a first among equals.<ref>John Joseph Saunders, ''A History of Medieval Islam'', Routledge 1978 p130</ref> All property within the community was distributed evenly among all initiates. The Qarmatians were organized as an [[esoteric]] society but not as a secret one; their activities were public and openly propagated, but new members had to undergo an initiation ceremony involving seven stages. The Qarmatian world view was one where every phenomenon repeated itself in cycles, where every incident was replayed over and over again, a concept similar to the cycle of life and Karma.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nFor much of the 10th century the Qarmatians were the most powerful force in the Persian Gulf and Middle East, controlling the coast of Oman, and collecting tribute from the [[Abbasid]] caliph in Baghdad and from the rival Ismaili [[Fatimid]] caliph in Cairo, whom they did not recognize. The land they ruled over was extremely wealthy with a huge slave-based economy according to academic Yitzhak Nakash:\n\n{{cquote|The Qarmatian state had vast fruit and grain estates both on the islands and in Hasa and Qatif. Nasiri Khusru, who visited Hasa in 1051, recounted that these estates were cultivated by some thirty thousand Ethiopian slaves. He mentions that the people of Hasa were exempt from taxes. Those impoverished or in debt could obtain a loan until they put their affairs in order. No interest was taken on loans, and token lead money was used for all local transactions. The Qarmathian state had a powerful and long-lasting legacy. This is evidenced by a coin known as Tawila, minted around 920 by one of the Qarmathian rulers, and which was still in circulation in Hasa early in the 20th century, 1100 years later.<ref>Yitzhak Nakash, Reaching for Power: The Shi'a in the Modern Arab World, Princeton 2007</ref>}}\n\nThe Qarmatians were defeated in battle in 976 by the [[Abbasids]], which encouraged them to look inward to build their utilitarian society.

However, the Hormuzi rulers did not seem to have firm control of the islands, and during the 14th century Bahrain was disputed as numerous neighbours sought tribute from the wealth accumulated from its pearl fisheries. In the 15th century another branch of the Banu Amir emerged, the [[Jabrids]], who built a more stable polity in eastern Arabia.<ref>Curtis E. Larsen.

They were descendants of the tribe of [[Uqayl]], a branch of [[Bani 'Amir]].\n\nTheir most prominent ruler was [[Ajwad ibn Zamil]], who died in 1507. He was described by his contemporaries as having been \"of Najdi origin.\"  Ajwad's elder brother had earlier established the dynasty in the early 15th century by deposing and killing the last Jarwanid ruler in Qatif. At their height, the Jabrids controlled the entire Arabian coast on the Persian Gulf, including the islands of Bahrain, and regularly led expeditions into central Arabia and Oman. One contemporary scholar described Ajwad ibn Zamil as \"the king of al-Ahsa and Qatif and the leader of the people of Najd.\" Following his death, his kingdom was divided among some of his descendants, with [[Migrin ibn Zamil]] (possibly his grandson) inheriting al-Hasa, Qatif, and Bahrain. Migrin fell in battle in Bahrain in a failed attempt to repel an invasion of Bahrain by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1521.\n\nThe Jabrid kingdom collapsed soon afterwards on the mainland, after an invasion of al-Hasa by [[Muntafiq]] tribe of [[Basrah]], and later by the [[Ottoman Turks]]. One branch of the Jabrids remained active in Oman, however, for nearly another three centuries. It is unknown for sure what became of the non-Omani Jabrids.

This led to a lasting animosity between them and the staunchly anti-Shi'ite [[Wahhabis]] and the House of [[Saud]], from the mid-18th century to the present. Bani Khalid maintained ties with members of their tribe who had settled in [[Nejd]] during their earlier migration eastwards, and also cultivated clients among the rulers of the Nejdi towns, such as ''Al Mu'ammar'' of [[Al-Uyayna]]. When the emir of Uyayna adopted the ideas of [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]], the Khalidi chief ordered him to cease support for Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and expel him from his town. The emir agreed, and Ibn Abd al-Wahhab moved to neighboring [[Dir'iyyah]], where he joined forces with the [[Al Saud]]. The Bani Khalid remained staunch enemies of the Saudis and their allies and attempted to invade Nejd and Diriyyah in an effort to stop Saudi expansion. Their efforts failed, however, and after conquering Nejd, the Saudis invaded the Bani Khalid's domain in al-Hasa and deposed Al 'Ura'yir in 1793.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nWhen the [[Egyptians]] under [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]] invaded Arabia and deposed ''Al Saud'' in 1818, they reoccupied Al-Hasa and Al-Qatif and reinstated members of Al 'Uray'ir as governors of the region on their behalf. Bani Khalid were no longer the potent military force they once were at this time, and tribes such as the [['Ajman (tribe)|Ajman]], the [[Dawasir]], [[Subay']], and [[Mutayr]] began encroaching on Bani Khalid's desert territories. They were also beset by internal quarrels over leadership. Though the Bani Khalid were able to forge an alliance with the [['Anizzah]] tribe in this period, they were eventually defeated by an alliance of several tribes along with Al Saud, who had re-established their rule in [[Riyadh]] in 1823. A battle with an alliance led by the Mutayri and 'Ajmani tribes in 1823,<ref>Meglio</ref> and another battle with the [[Subay']] and ''Al Saud'' in 1830, brought the rule of the Bani Khalid to a close.

These letters and other documents, hint at an administrative relationship between Dilmun and [[Babylon]] at that time.

Impressions of clay seals from the Indus Valley city of [[Harappa]] were evidently used to seal bundles of merchandise, as clay seal impressions with cord or sack marks on the reverse side testify. A number of these Indus Valley seals have turned up at [[Ur]] and other Mesopotamian sites.\n\nThe \u201cPersian Gulf\u201d types of circular, stamped (rather than rolled) seals known from Dilmun, that appear at [[Lothal]] in [[Gujarat]], India, and [[Failaka]], as well as in Mesopotamia, are convincing corroboration of the long-distance sea trade. What the commerce consisted of is less known: timber and precious woods, [[ivory]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[gold]], and luxury goods such as [[carnelian]] and glazed stone beads, [[pearl]]s from the Persian Gulf, shell and bone inlays, were among the goods sent to Mesopotamia in exchange for [[silver]], [[tin]], woolen textiles, olive oil and grains. [[Copper]] ingots from Oman and [[bitumen]] which occurred naturally in Mesopotamia may have been exchanged for cotton textiles and domestic fowl, major products of the Indus region that are not native to Mesopotamia. Instances of all of these trade goods have been found. The importance of this trade is shown by the fact that the weights and measures used at Dilmun were in fact identical to those used by the Indus, and were not those used in Southern Mesopotamia.\n\n:\u201c''the ships of Dilmun, from the foreign land, brought him wood as a tribute''\u201d.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=33}}\n\nMesopotamian trade documents, lists of goods, and official inscriptions mentioning Meluhha supplement Harappan seals and archaeological finds. Literary references to Meluhhan trade date from the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian, the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], and [[Isin]]-[[Larsa]] Periods (c. 2350 \u2013 1800 BC), but the trade probably started in the Early Dynastic Period (c. 2600 BC). Some Meluhhan vessels may have sailed directly to Mesopotamian ports, but by the Isin-Larsa Period, Dilmun monopolized the trade.

Eastern Arabians were amongst the first to embrace Islam during the time of the [[Prophets and messengers of Islam|Islamic ''Nabi'']] ([[Prophet]]) [[Muhammad]], who ruled eastern Arabia through one of his representatives, [[Al-Ala'a Al-Hadhrami]]. Eastern Arabia embraced Islam in 629 (the seventh year of ''Hijrah''). During the time of [[Umar]] I the [[Sahaba|companion]] of Mohammad, [[Abu Hurairah]], was the governor of eastern Arabia. Umar I also appointed [[Uthman bin Abu al-As]] as governor of the area. [[Al Khamis Mosque]], founded in 692, was one of the [[earliest [[mosque]]s built in eastern Arabia, in the era of [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Umar II]].\n\nThe expansion of Islam did not affect eastern Arabia's reliance on trade, and its prosperity continued to be dependent on markets in India and Mesopotamia. After [[Baghdad]] emerged as the seat of the [[caliph]] in 750 and the main centre of Islamic civilization, eastern Arabia greatly benefited from the city's increased demand for foreign goods especially from China and South Asia.\n\nEastern Arabia, specifically Bahrain, became a principal centre of knowledge for hundreds of years stretching from the early days of Islam in the 6th century to the 18th century. Philosophers of eastern Arabia were highly esteemed, such as the 13th-century mystic, Sheikh [[Maitham Al Bahrani]] (died in 1299) (The mosque of Sheikh Maitham and his tomb can be visited in the outskirts of the capital, [[Manama]], near the district of [[Mahooz]]).\n\n====Qarmatian Republic====\n{{Main|Qarmatians}}\n[[File:Eastern & Central Arabia 9th\u201310th Centuries.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of eastern and central Arabia in the 9th\u201310th centuries]]\n\nIn the end of the 3rd [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] century, Abu Sa'id al-Hasan al-Janaby led the [[Revolution of al-Qaramita]], a rebellion by a [[messiah|messianic]] [[Ismaili]] sect originating in [[Kufa]] in present-day Iraq. Al-Janaby took over the city of Hajr, Bahrain's capital at that time, and Al-Hasa, which he made the capital of his republic. Once in control of the state he sought to create a [[utopian]] society.\n\nThe Qarmatians' goal was to build a society based on reason and equality. The state was governed by a council of six with a chief who was a first among equals.<ref>John Joseph Saunders, ''A History of Medieval Islam'', Routledge 1978 p130</ref> All property within the community was distributed evenly among all initiates. The Qarmatians were organized as an [[esoteric]] society but not as a secret one; their activities were public and openly propagated, but new members had to undergo an initiation ceremony involving seven stages. The Qarmatian world view was one where every phenomenon repeated itself in cycles, where every incident was replayed over and over again, a concept similar to the cycle of life and Karma.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nFor much of the 10th century the Qarmatians were the most powerful force in the Persian Gulf and Middle East, controlling the coast of Oman, and collecting tribute from the [[Abbasid]] caliph in Baghdad and from the rival Ismaili [[Fatimid]] caliph in Cairo, whom they did not recognize. The land they ruled over was extremely wealthy with a huge slave-based economy according to academic Yitzhak Nakash:\n\n{{cquote|The Qarmatian state had vast fruit and grain estates both on the islands and in Hasa and Qatif. Nasiri Khusru, who visited Hasa in 1051, recounted that these estates were cultivated by some thirty thousand Ethiopian slaves. He mentions that the people of Hasa were exempt from taxes. Those impoverished or in debt could obtain a loan until they put their affairs in order. No interest was taken on loans, and token lead money was used for all local transactions. The Qarmathian state had a powerful and long-lasting legacy. This is evidenced by a coin known as Tawila, minted around 920 by one of the Qarmathian rulers, and which was still in circulation in Hasa early in the 20th century, 1100 years later.<ref>Yitzhak Nakash, Reaching for Power: The Shi'a in the Modern Arab World, Princeton 2007</ref>}}\n\nThe Qarmatians were defeated in battle in 976 by the [[Abbasids]], which encouraged them to look inward to build their utilitarian society.

However, the Hormuzi rulers did not seem to have firm control of the islands, and during the 14th century Bahrain was disputed as numerous neighbours sought tribute from the wealth accumulated from its pearl fisheries. In the 15th century another branch of the Banu Amir emerged, the [[Jabrids]], who built a more stable polity in eastern Arabia.<ref>Curtis E. Larsen.

They were descendants of the tribe of [[Uqayl]], a branch of [[Bani 'Amir]].\n\nTheir most prominent ruler was [[Ajwad ibn Zamil]], who died in 1507. He was described by his contemporaries as having been \"of Najdi origin.\"  Ajwad's elder brother had earlier established the dynasty in the early 15th century by deposing and killing the last Jarwanid ruler in Qatif. At their height, the Jabrids controlled the entire Arabian coast on the Persian Gulf, including the islands of Bahrain, and regularly led expeditions into central Arabia and Oman. One contemporary scholar described Ajwad ibn Zamil as \"the king of al-Ahsa and Qatif and the leader of the people of Najd.\" Following his death, his kingdom was divided among some of his descendants, with [[Migrin ibn Zamil]] (possibly his grandson) inheriting al-Hasa, Qatif, and Bahrain. Migrin fell in battle in Bahrain in a failed attempt to repel an invasion of Bahrain by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1521.\n\nThe Jabrid kingdom collapsed soon afterwards on the mainland, after an invasion of al-Hasa by [[Muntafiq]] tribe of [[Basrah]], and later by the [[Ottoman Turks]]. One branch of the Jabrids remained active in Oman, however, for nearly another three centuries. It is unknown for sure what became of the non-Omani Jabrids. Some believe they left to Iraq, while others believe they are identical with the [[Jubur]] section of the [[Bani Khalid]] confederation, who eventually took control of the region after the Jabrids.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n====Bani Khalid====\nThe main branches of the tribe are Al Humaid, the Juboor, the Du'um, Al Janah, the Grusha, Al Musallam, the 'Amayer, Al Subaih and the Mahashir.<ref name=\"Al-Jassir\">Al-Jassir</ref> The chieftainship of Bani Khalid has traditionally been held by the clan of Al Humaid. The Bani Khalid dominated the deserts surrounding Al-Hasa and Al-Qatif oases during the 16th and 17th centuries.<ref>Mandaville, p. 503</ref> Under [[Barrak ibn Ghurayr]] of Al Humaid, the Bani Khalid were able to expel Ottoman forces from the cities and towns in 1670 and proclaim their rule over the region.<ref>Fattah, p. 83</ref><ref name=\"Ibn Agil, p. 78\">Ibn Agil, p. 78</ref> Ibn Ghurayr made his capital in [[Al-Mubarraz]], where remnants of his castle stand today. According to Arabian folklore, one chief of the Bani Khalid attempted to protect the prized desert [[bustard]] (''[[Arabian bustard|habari]]'') from extinction by prohibiting the [[bedouin]] in his realm from poaching the bird's eggs, earning the tribe the appellation of \"protectors of the eggs of the habari\", an allusion to the chief's absolute supremacy over his realm.<ref>[http://www.bnykhaled.com/arabic/ \u0634\u0628\u0643\u0629 \u0642\u0628\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0628\u0646\u064a \u062e\u0627\u0644\u062f<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104121040/http://www.bnykhaled.com/arabic/ |date=2006-11-04 }}</ref> The first chieftain of the \u201cKhawalid\u201d was Haddori.{{clarify|date=February 2013}}\n\nLike a vast majority of their subject people, in time the Khalidis adopted Shi'ite Islam if they were not already so at the time of their ascendency. This led to a lasting animosity between them and the staunchly anti-Shi'ite [[Wahhabis]] and the House of [[Saud]], from the mid-18th century to the present. Bani Khalid maintained ties with members of their tribe who had settled in [[Nejd]] during their earlier migration eastwards, and also cultivated clients among the rulers of the Nejdi towns, such as ''Al Mu'ammar'' of [[Al-Uyayna]]. When the emir of Uyayna adopted the ideas of [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]], the Khalidi chief ordered him to cease support for Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and expel him from his town. The emir agreed, and Ibn Abd al-Wahhab moved to neighboring [[Dir'iyyah]], where he joined forces with the [[Al Saud]]. The Bani Khalid remained staunch enemies of the Saudis and their allies and attempted to invade Nejd and Diriyyah in an effort to stop Saudi expansion. Their efforts failed, however, and after conquering Nejd, the Saudis invaded the Bani Khalid's domain in al-Hasa and deposed Al 'Ura'yir in 1793.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nWhen the [[Egyptians]] under [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]] invaded Arabia and deposed ''Al Saud'' in 1818, they reoccupied Al-Hasa and Al-Qatif and reinstated members of Al 'Uray'ir as governors of the region on their behalf. Bani Khalid were no longer the potent military force they once were at this time, and tribes such as the [['Ajman (tribe)|Ajman]], the [[Dawasir]], [[Subay']], and [[Mutayr]] began encroaching on Bani Khalid's desert territories. They were also beset by internal quarrels over leadership. Though the Bani Khalid were able to forge an alliance with the [['Anizzah]] tribe in this period, they were eventually defeated by an alliance of several tribes along with Al Saud, who had re-established their rule in [[Riyadh]] in 1823. A battle with an alliance led by the Mutayri and 'Ajmani tribes in 1823,<ref>Meglio</ref> and another battle with the [[Subay']] and ''Al Saud'' in 1830, brought the rule of the Bani Khalid to a close. The Ottomans appointed a governor from Bani Khalid over al-Hasa once more in 1874, but his rule also was short-lived.<ref>Al-Rasheed, p. 36</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Qanat|Falaj]]''\n* [[Musandam Peninsula]]\n* ''[[Ras Al Hadd]]''\n** ''[[Ras al-Jinz]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{coord missing|Saudi Arabia}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Regions of the world}}\n\n[[Category:Eastern Arabia]]\n[[Category:Historical regions]]\n", "name_user": "Desb42", "label": "safe", "comment": "remove chars", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Arabia"}
