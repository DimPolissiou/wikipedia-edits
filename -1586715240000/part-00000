Students may choose to opt-out of this punishment once per semester if they choose to instead take a \"work Jug\", which entails providing an adequate service alternative by aiding staff and teachers.  Repeat or serious offenses will result in a \"Saturday Jug\", a 4-hour detention during the weekend issue by the Dean of Students.

This demerit system is mediated by a \"demerit card\" that all students must have on them during school hours.  Each semester, students are issued a demerit card with spaces for 40 demerits.  At 5 demerit intervals, a student will receive a detention, referred to as a \"Jug\" (standing for Justice Under God)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omaha.com/news/kelly-creighton-prep-losing-a-living-saint/article_6b1b8769-4bc6-5f62-bbb2-7ff4188696c0.html|title=Kelly: Creighton Prep losing a 'living saint'|last=columnist|first=Michael Kelly / World-Herald|website=Omaha.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>.

Students may choose to opt-out of this punishment once per semester if they choose to instead take a \"work Jug\", which entails providing an adequate service alternative by aiding staff and teachers.  Repeat or serious offenses will result in a \"Saturday Jug\", a 4-hour detention during the weekend issue by the Dean of Students.

This issue was stated to be a result of the bylaws of the [[Nebraska School Activities Association]], which state \"member schools are charged with maintaining proper crowd control and enforcing principles of good sportsmanship and ethics at all interscholastic contests\". Therefore, individual schools have are responsible for maintaining these standards but \"what\u2019s appropriate is up to the schools\" (Jim Tenopir).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omaha.com/news/education/are-students-going-too-far-in-the-way-they-boo/article_1c9bd474-7d09-52c4-a771-dde842f1f8f8.html|title=Are students going too far in the way they boo?

Glenn described Prep as \"no place for sissies\", stating that Prep culture created a hostile place supporting [[anathema]] against those of a gay identity. This included accounts of physical violence against him due to his sexuality, and affirming that the culture against those who are gay is still present. This further included descriptions of how Creighton Prep's dominate culture surround gay identities is that it was viewed as \"sick, sinful and unacceptable in the eyes of the world.\" This ended with Glenn describing that Prep needed a paradigm shift in their culture as the status quo has conveyed the message of gay students being seen as \"damaged goods\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/313/faith-focus/god-intended|title=As God Intended|date=2001-05-21|website=America Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, President of Creighton Prep, Reverend Robert Hotz resigned following an incident where he invited an openly gay alumni to speak on his experiences pertaining both religion, service, and homosexuality.

It produced four singles, including \"[[Single (Natasha Bedingfield song)|Single]]\", \"[[These Words]]\", which peaked at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]], \"[[Unwritten (song)|Unwritten]]\" and \"[[I Bruise Easily]]\". The album reached number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was [[Music recording sales certification|certified]] 3\u00d7 Platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI). Her second album, ''[[N.B. (album)|N.B.]]'', was released in 2007 and was less successful, but still reached number nine in the UK and produced two UK top ten singles. For the North American market, ''N.B.'' was repackaged and was released with an altered track listing under the name ''[[N.B. (album)|Pocketful of Sunshine]]'' in January 2008. The album reached number three on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Bedingfield's third album, ''[[Strip Me]]'', was released in the United States and Canada in December 2010. The album received similar treatment to its predecessor and was released in Europe under the title ''[[Strip Me|Strip Me Away]]'' in 2011.\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions, sales, and certifications\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| [[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|[[UK Albums Chart|UK]]<br><ref name=uk>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/2578/natasha-bedingfield/|title=UK Charts > Natasha Bedingfield|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=2019-08-30}}</ref>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|[[ARIA Charts|AUS]]<br><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20041220-0000/ISSUE766.pdf|title=ARIA Charts > ARIA Report > 1 November 2004|issue=766|format=PDF|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|accessdate=2011-08-04}}</ref>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|[[\u00d63 Austria Top 40|AUT]]<br><ref name=aut>{{cite web|url=http://austriancharts.at/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Natasha+Bedingfield|title=Austrian Charts > Natasha Bedingfield|language=German|publisher= austriancharts.at Hung Medien|accessdate=2010-11-26}}</ref>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|[[Canadian Albums Chart|CAN]]<br><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/natasha-bedingfield/chart-history/canadian-albums|title=Natasha Bedingfield Chart History: Canadian Albums|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=2018-09-06}}</ref>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|[[GfK Entertainment Charts|GER]]<br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Bedingfield%2CNatasha/?type=longplay|title=Chartverfolgung / Natasha Bedingfield / Longplay|language=German|publisher=musicline.de PhonoNet|accessdate=2010-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016231316/http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Bedingfield,Natasha/?type=longplay|archive-date=16 October 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|[[Irish Albums Chart|IRE]]<br><ref name=ire>{{cite web|url=http://irish-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Natasha+Bedingfield|title=Irish Charts > Natasha Bedingfield|publisher=irish-charts.com Hung Medien|accessdate=2010-07-18}}</ref>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|[[MegaCharts|NLD]]<br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dutchcharts.nl/search.asp?search=natasha+bedingfield&cat=a|title=Dutch Album Charts > Natasha Bedingfield|language=Dutch|publisher=dutchcharts.nl Hung Medien|accessdate=2011-08-04}}</ref>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|[[Official New Zealand Music Chart|NZ]]<br><ref name=nz>{{cite web |url=https://charts.nz/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Natasha+Bedingfield|title=New Zealand Charts > Natasha Bedingfield|publisher=charts.nz Hung Medien|accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|[[Swiss Hitparade|SWI]]<br><ref name=swi>{{cite web|url=http://hitparade.ch/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Natasha+Bedingfield|title=Swiss Charts > Natasha Bedingfield|language=German|publisher=hitparade.ch Hung Medien|accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|[[Billboard 200|US]]<br><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/natasha-bedingfield/chart-history/billboard-200|title=Natasha Bedingfield Chart History: Billboard 200|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=2018-09-06}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Unwritten (album)|Unwritten]]''\n|\n*Released: 6 September 2004\n*Label: [[Phonogenic Records|Phonogenic]], [[Epic Records|Epic]]\n*Formats: [[Compact Disc|CD]], [[Music download|digital download]]\n| 1 || 89 || 31 || \u2014 || 20 || 4 || 16 || 31 || 23 || 26\n|\n*[[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]]: 3\u00d7 Platinum<ref name=bpi>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |title=BPI Certified Awards |publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |accessdate=2011-08-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511120001/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}</ref>\n*[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]: Gold<ref name=riaa>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.org/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=RIAA Gold & Platinum|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=2011-08-04}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[N.B.

It produced four singles, including \"[[Single (Natasha Bedingfield song)|Single]]\", \"[[These Words]]\", which peaked at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]], \"[[Unwritten (song)|Unwritten]]\" and \"[[I Bruise Easily]]\". The album reached number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was [[Music recording sales certification|certified]] 3\u00d7 Platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI). Her second album, ''[[N.B. (album)|N.B.]]'', was released in 2007 and was less successful, but still reached number nine in the UK and produced two UK top ten singles. For the North American market, ''N.B.'' was repackaged and was released with an altered track listing under the name ''[[N.B. (album)|Pocketful of Sunshine]]'' in January 2008. The album reached number three on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Bedingfield's third album, ''[[Strip Me]]'', was released in the United States and Canada in December 2010.
