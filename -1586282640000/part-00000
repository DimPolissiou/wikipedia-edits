{"title_page": "Politics of Texas", "text_new": "{{Politics of Texas}}\nFor approximately 99 years, from after [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] until the 1990s, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] dominated [[Texas]] politics.\n\nIn a reversal of alignments, since the late 1960s the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] has grown more prominent. By the mid-1990s, it became the state's dominant political party.\n\nToday Texas remains Republican, voting for Donald Trump in 2016. Republican dominance of rural Texas keeps the overwhelming majority of Texas counties Republican.\n\n==Cultural background==\nThe 19th-century culture of the state was heavily influenced by the [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] culture of the ''[[Old South]],'' dependent on [[African-American]] [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor, as well as the ''patron'' system once prevalent (and still somewhat present) in northern Mexico and South Texas. In these societies the government's primary role was seen as being the preservation of social order. Solving of individual problems in society was seen as a local problem with the expectation that the individual with wealth should resolve his or her own issues.<ref name=\"Maxwell 2009 p. 22\"/> These influences continue to affect Texas today. In their book, ''Texas Politics Today 2009-2010,'' authors Maxwell, Crain, and Santos attribute Texas' traditionally low voter turnout among whites to these influences.<ref name=\"Maxwell 2009 p. 22\">Maxwell (2009), p. 22.</ref> But beginning in the early 20th century, voter turnout was dramatically reduced by the state legislature's [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] of most blacks, and many poor whites and Latinos.<ref name=\"utexas1\">[http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/6_5_3.html ''Texas Politics: Historical Barriers to Voting''], accessed 11 Apr 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402060131/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/html/vce/0503.html |date=April 2, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Democratic dominance==\nFrom [[U.S. presidential election, 1848|1848]] until [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s victory in [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952]], Texas voted for the Democratic candidate for president in every election except [[U.S. presidential election, 1928|1928]], when it did not support Catholic [[Al Smith]]. The state had a white majority and Democrats re-established their dominance after the Civil War. In the mid-20th century [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1956|1956]] elections, the state voters joined the landslide for [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. (Texas did not vote in 1864 and 1868 due to the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/historical/presidential.shtml|title=Presidential Election Results|website=www.sos.state.tx.us}}</ref>\n\nIn the post-Civil War era, two of the most important Republican figures in Texas were African Americans [[George T. Ruby]] and [[Norris Wright Cuney]]. Ruby was a black community organizer, director in the federal [[Freedmen's Bureau]], and leader of the Galveston [[Union League]]. His prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Cuney was a [[mulatto]] whose wealthy, white planter father freed him and his siblings before the Civil War and arranged for his education in Pennsylvania. Cuney returned and settled in Galveston, where he became active in the [[Union League]] and the Republican party; he rose to the leadership of the party. He became influential in Galveston and Texas politics, and is widely regarded as one of the most influential black leaders in the [[American South|South]] during the 19th century.\n\nFrom 1902 through 1965, Texas had virtually [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and many Latinos and poor whites through imposition of the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and [[white primaries]]. Across the South, Democrats controlled congressional apportionment based on total population, although they had disenfranchised the black population. The [[Solid South]] exercised tremendous power in Congress, and Democrats gained important committee chairmanships by seniority. They gained federal funding for infrastructure projects in their states and the region, as well as support for numerous military bases, as two examples of how they brought federal investment to the state and region.\n\nIn the post-Reconstruction era, by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] became non-competitive in the South, due to Democrat-dominated legislatures' [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] of blacks and many poor whites and Latinos. In Texas, the Democrat-dominated legislature excluded them through passage of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and [[white primary]]. As can be seen on the graph at the following link, voter turnout in Texas declined dramatically following these disenfranchisement measures, and Southern voting turnout was far below the national average.<ref name=\"utexas1\"/>\n\nAlthough blacks made up 20 percent of the state population at the turn of the century, they were essentially excluded from formal politics.<ref name=HTO>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pkaan W. Marvin Dulaney, \"African Americans\"], ''Handbook of Texas Online'', accessed 22 February 2014</ref> Republican support in Texas had been based almost exclusively in the free black communities, particularly in Galveston, and in the so-called \"German counties\" \u2013 the rural [[Texas Hill Country]] inhabited by [[German American|German]] immigrants and their descendants, who had opposed slavery in the antebellum period. The German counties continued to run Republican candidates. [[Harry M. Wurzbach]] was elected from the [[Texas's 14th congressional district|14th district]] from 1920 to 1926, contesting and finally winning the election of 1928, and being re-elected in 1930.\n\nSome of the most important American political figures of the 20th century, such as President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], Vice-President [[John Nance Garner]], Speaker of the House [[Sam Rayburn]], and Senator [[Ralph Yarborough]] were Texas Democrats. But, the Texas Democrats were rarely united, being divided into [[American conservatism|conservative]], [[moderate]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] factions that vied with one another for power.\n\n==Increasing Republican strength: 1960 to 1990==\n{{unsourced|section|date=September 2019}}\nSome analysts suggest that the rebirth of the Republican Party in Texas among white conservatives can be traced to 1952, when Democratic Governor [[Allan Shivers]] clashed with the [[Truman Administration]] over the federal claim on the [[Tidelands]]. He worked to help Texas native General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to carry the state. Eisenhower was generally highly respected due to his role as Commander of the Allies in World War II and was popular nationally, winning the election. Beginning in the late 1960s, Republican strength increased in Texas, particularly among residents of the expanding \"country club suburbs\" around [[Dallas]] and [[Houston]]. The election, to Congress, of Republicans such as [[John Tower]] (who had shifted from the Democratic Party) and [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1961 and 1966, respectively, reflected this trend. Nationally, outside of the South, Democrats supported the [[civil rights movement]] and achieved important passage of federal legislation in the mid-1960s. In the South, however, Democratic leaders had opposed changes to bring about black voting or desegregated schools and public facilities and in many places exercised resistance. Following passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], southern white voters began to align with the Republican Party, a movement accelerated after the next year, when Congress passed the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], providing for federal enforcement of minorities' constitutional right to vote. Voter registration and turnout increased among blacks and Latinos in Texas and other states.\n\nUnlike the rest of the South, however, Texas voters were never especially supportive of the various third-party candidacies of Southern Democrats. It was the only state in the former Confederacy to back Democrat [[Hubert Humphrey]] in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]]. During the 1980s, a number of conservative Democrats defected to the GOP, including Senator [[Phil Gramm]], Congressman [[Kent Hance]], and GOP Governor [[Rick Perry]], who was a Democrat during his time as a state lawmaker.\n\n[[John Tower]]'s 1961 election to the U.S. Senate made him the first statewide GOP officeholder since Reconstruction and the disenfranchisement of black Republicans. Republican Governor [[Bill Clements]] and Senator [[Phil Gramm]] (also a former Democrat) were elected after him. Republicans became increasingly dominant in national elections in white-majority Texas. The last Democratic presidential candidate to win the state was [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976]]. Previously, a Democrat had to win Texas to win the White House, but in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 election]], [[Bill Clinton]] won the Oval Office while losing Texas electoral votes. This result significantly reduced the power of Texas Democrats at the national level, as party leaders believed the state had become unwinnable.\n\n==Redistricting disputes and the 1990s==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\nDespite increasing Republican strength in national elections, after the 1990 [[census]], Texas Democrats still controlled both houses of the State Legislature and most statewide offices. As a result, they directed the redistricting process after the decennial census. Although Congressional Texas Democrats received an average of 45 percent of the votes, Democrats consistently had a majority in the state delegation, as they had in every election since at least the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].\n\nIn 1994, Democratic Governor [[Ann Richards]] lost her bid for re-election against Republican [[George W. Bush]], ending an era in which Democrats controlled the governorship for all but eight of the past 120 years. Republicans have won the governorship ever since. In 1998, Bush won re-election in a landslide victory, with Republicans sweeping to victory in all the statewide races.\n\nAfter the 2000 census, the Republican-controlled [[Texas Senate|state Senate]] sought to draw a congressional district map that would guarantee a Republican majority in the state's delegation.  The Democrat-controlled [[Texas House of Representatives|state House]] desired to retain a plan similar to the existing lines. There was an impasse. With the Legislature unable to reach a compromise, the matter was settled by a panel of federal court judges, who ruled in favor of a district map that largely retained the status quo.\n\nBut, Republicans dominated the Legislative Redistricting Board, which defines the state legislative districts, by a majority of four to one. The Republicans on this board used their voting strength to adopt a map for the state Senate that was more favorable to the Republicans as well as a map for the state House that also strongly favored them, as Democrats had also done before them.\n\nIn 2002, Texas Republicans gained control of the Texas House of Representatives for the first time since Reconstruction. The newly elected Republican legislature engaged in an unprecedented mid-decade [[2003 Texas redistricting|redistricting]] plan. Democrats said that the redistricting was a blatant partisan [[gerrymander]], while Republicans argued that it was a much-needed correction of the partisan lines drawn after the 1990 census. But, the Republicans ignored the effects of nearly one million new citizens in the state, basing redistricting on 2000 census data. The result was a gain of six seats by the Republicans in the 2004 elections, giving them a majority of the state's delegation for the first time since Reconstruction.\n\nIn December 2005, the [[US Supreme Court]] agreed to hear an appeal that challenged the legality of this redistricting plan.  While largely upholding the map, it ruled the [[El Paso]]-to-[[San Antonio]] 23rd District, which had been a protected majority-Latino district until the 2003 redistricting, was unconstitutionally drawn.  The ruling forced nearly every district in the El Paso-San Antonio corridor to be reconfigured.  Partly due to this, Democrats picked up two seats in the state in the 2006 elections.  The 23rd's Republican incumbent was defeated in this election.

The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final.

His prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Cuney was a [[mulatto]] whose wealthy, white planter father freed him and his siblings before the Civil War and arranged for his education in Pennsylvania. Cuney returned and settled in Galveston, where he became active in the [[Union League]] and the Republican party; he rose to the leadership of the party. He became influential in Galveston and Texas politics, and is widely regarded as one of the most influential black leaders in the [[American South|South]] during the 19th century.\n\nFrom 1902 through 1965, Texas had virtually [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and many Latinos and poor whites through imposition of the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and [[white primaries]]. Across the South, Democrats controlled congressional apportionment based on total population, although they had disenfranchised the black population. The [[Solid South]] exercised tremendous power in Congress, and Democrats gained important committee chairmanships by seniority. They gained federal funding for infrastructure projects in their states and the region, as well as support for numerous military bases, as two examples of how they brought federal investment to the state and region.\n\nIn the post-Reconstruction era, by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] became non-competitive in the South, due to Democrat-dominated legislatures' [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] of blacks and many poor whites and Latinos. In Texas, the Democrat-dominated legislature excluded them through passage of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and [[white primary]]. As can be seen on the graph at the following link, voter turnout in Texas declined dramatically following these disenfranchisement measures, and Southern voting turnout was far below the national average.<ref name=\"utexas1\"/>\n\nAlthough blacks made up 20 percent of the state population at the turn of the century, they were essentially excluded from formal politics.<ref name=HTO>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pkaan W. Marvin Dulaney, \"African Americans\"], ''Handbook of Texas Online'', accessed 22 February 2014</ref> Republican support in Texas had been based almost exclusively in the free black communities, particularly in Galveston, and in the so-called \"German counties\" \u2013 the rural [[Texas Hill Country]] inhabited by [[German American|German]] immigrants and their descendants, who had opposed slavery in the antebellum period. The German counties continued to run Republican candidates. [[Harry M. Wurzbach]] was elected from the [[Texas's 14th congressional district|14th district]] from 1920 to 1926, contesting and finally winning the election of 1928, and being re-elected in 1930.\n\nSome of the most important American political figures of the 20th century, such as President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], Vice-President [[John Nance Garner]], Speaker of the House [[Sam Rayburn]], and Senator [[Ralph Yarborough]] were Texas Democrats. But, the Texas Democrats were rarely united, being divided into [[American conservatism|conservative]], [[moderate]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] factions that vied with one another for power.\n\n==Increasing Republican strength: 1960 to 1990==\n{{unsourced|section|date=September 2019}}\nSome analysts suggest that the rebirth of the Republican Party in Texas among white conservatives can be traced to 1952, when Democratic Governor [[Allan Shivers]] clashed with the [[Truman Administration]] over the federal claim on the [[Tidelands]]. He worked to help Texas native General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to carry the state. Eisenhower was generally highly respected due to his role as Commander of the Allies in World War II and was popular nationally, winning the election. Beginning in the late 1960s, Republican strength increased in Texas, particularly among residents of the expanding \"country club suburbs\" around [[Dallas]] and [[Houston]]. The election, to Congress, of Republicans such as [[John Tower]] (who had shifted from the Democratic Party) and [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1961 and 1966, respectively, reflected this trend. Nationally, outside of the South, Democrats supported the [[civil rights movement]] and achieved important passage of federal legislation in the mid-1960s. In the South, however, Democratic leaders had opposed changes to bring about black voting or desegregated schools and public facilities and in many places exercised resistance. Following passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], southern white voters began to align with the Republican Party, a movement accelerated after the next year, when Congress passed the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], providing for federal enforcement of minorities' constitutional right to vote. Voter registration and turnout increased among blacks and Latinos in Texas and other states.\n\nUnlike the rest of the South, however, Texas voters were never especially supportive of the various third-party candidacies of Southern Democrats. It was the only state in the former Confederacy to back Democrat [[Hubert Humphrey]] in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]]. During the 1980s, a number of conservative Democrats defected to the GOP, including Senator [[Phil Gramm]], Congressman [[Kent Hance]], and GOP Governor [[Rick Perry]], who was a Democrat during his time as a state lawmaker.\n\n[[John Tower]]'s 1961 election to the U.S. Senate made him the first statewide GOP officeholder since Reconstruction and the disenfranchisement of black Republicans. Republican Governor [[Bill Clements]] and Senator [[Phil Gramm]] (also a former Democrat) were elected after him. Republicans became increasingly dominant in national elections in white-majority Texas. The last Democratic presidential candidate to win the state was [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976]]. Previously, a Democrat had to win Texas to win the White House, but in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 election]], [[Bill Clinton]] won the Oval Office while losing Texas electoral votes. This result significantly reduced the power of Texas Democrats at the national level, as party leaders believed the state had become unwinnable.\n\n==Redistricting disputes and the 1990s==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\nDespite increasing Republican strength in national elections, after the 1990 [[census]], Texas Democrats still controlled both houses of the State Legislature and most statewide offices. As a result, they directed the redistricting process after the decennial census. Although Congressional Texas Democrats received an average of 45 percent of the votes, Democrats consistently had a majority in the state delegation, as they had in every election since at least the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].\n\nIn 1994, Democratic Governor [[Ann Richards]] lost her bid for re-election against Republican [[George W. Bush]], ending an era in which Democrats controlled the governorship for all but eight of the past 120 years. Republicans have won the governorship ever since. In 1998, Bush won re-election in a landslide victory, with Republicans sweeping to victory in all the statewide races.\n\nAfter the 2000 census, the Republican-controlled [[Texas Senate|state Senate]] sought to draw a congressional district map that would guarantee a Republican majority in the state's delegation.  The Democrat-controlled [[Texas House of Representatives|state House]] desired to retain a plan similar to the existing lines. There was an impasse. With the Legislature unable to reach a compromise, the matter was settled by a panel of federal court judges, who ruled in favor of a district map that largely retained the status quo.\n\nBut, Republicans dominated the Legislative Redistricting Board, which defines the state legislative districts, by a majority of four to one. The Republicans on this board used their voting strength to adopt a map for the state Senate that was more favorable to the Republicans as well as a map for the state House that also strongly favored them, as Democrats had also done before them.\n\nIn 2002, Texas Republicans gained control of the Texas House of Representatives for the first time since Reconstruction. The newly elected Republican legislature engaged in an unprecedented mid-decade [[2003 Texas redistricting|redistricting]] plan. Democrats said that the redistricting was a blatant partisan [[gerrymander]], while Republicans argued that it was a much-needed correction of the partisan lines drawn after the 1990 census. But, the Republicans ignored the effects of nearly one million new citizens in the state, basing redistricting on 2000 census data. The result was a gain of six seats by the Republicans in the 2004 elections, giving them a majority of the state's delegation for the first time since Reconstruction.\n\nIn December 2005, the [[US Supreme Court]] agreed to hear an appeal that challenged the legality of this redistricting plan.  While largely upholding the map, it ruled the [[El Paso]]-to-[[San Antonio]] 23rd District, which had been a protected majority-Latino district until the 2003 redistricting, was unconstitutionally drawn.  The ruling forced nearly every district in the El Paso-San Antonio corridor to be reconfigured.  Partly due to this, Democrats picked up two seats in the state in the 2006 elections.  The 23rd's Republican incumbent was defeated in this election. It was the first time a Democratic House challenger unseated a Texas Republican incumbent in 10 years.\n\n==Current situation==\n{{refimprove|section|date=September 2019}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; font-size:79%;\"\n|+ '''Texas Presidential elections results'''\n|- style=\"background:lightgrey;\"\n!

However, a 2017 Gallup poll found that it has only a 3 point gap in Democrats and Republicans. In 2018, Democrat [[Beto O'Rourke]] gained national coverage in his run for Senate partially due to this perception. He lost the election by 2.6 points, which was recognized as a remarkable result by the media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-08-13/texas-congress-suburban-women-republicans|title=In suburban Texas, 'it feels like there\u2019s no place for lifelong Republicans like me'|last=Mason|first=Melanie|date=2019-08-13|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref> O'Rourke likely benefited from the backlash against President Trump and the expected \"blue wave\" in the 2018 midterms.

The Gallup poll found that 20% are liberal and 35% moderate. Texas is receiving immigration and coming-of-age voters that are majority-Democrat. If Texas became a competitive state, it would have a very large impact as it is only one of the big 4 states that consistently goes Republican in recent presidential elections.

It avoided the housing industry meltdown and its unemployment rate continues to be below the national level.

[[Jordan]] ranks number one in the Arab World in education. The Jordanian Ministry of Education is now making it mandatory for students to be computer literate and able to apply their studies in computers to their regular studies, most especially the scientific and mathematical courses. Jordan's educational system meets international standards and its secondary education diploma is accepted in world-class universities.\n\n==Education Reform Efforts==\nThe recent education reforms started in the early 1990s. This reform process was accelerated under His Majesty [[King Abdullah II]] in early 2001 with a vision to make Jordan the regional technology hub and an active player in the global economy.\nThe National Vision and Mission for Education, as developed and endorsed in late 2002, states the desired direction for general education in the country. The two major consultative documents, that helped shape the national vision and also set directions for educational reform initiatives, were Jordan Vision 2020 and the 2002 Vision Forum for the Future of Education. These documents spanned kindergarten to lifelong continuing education. The overall strategy proposed by the Forum was endorsed by the Economic Consultative Council (ECC) in October 2002. The national development strategy and the Forum results were consolidated into specific development plans, the Social and Economic Transformation Plan, the General Education Plan 2003\u201308.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/05/04/000333038_20090504003729/Rendered/PDF/468240PAD0P105101Official0Use0Only1.pdf\n|title= World Bank 2009. \"Education Reform for Knowledge Economy II Project.\" Project Appraisal Document.pp4\n|access-date= 2009-12-28\n|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202600/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/05/04/000333038_20090504003729/Rendered/PDF/468240PAD0P105101Official0Use0Only1.pdf\n|archive-date= 2016-03-03\n|url-status= live\n}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2003, the Government of Jordan launched one of the most ambitious programs in the entire MENA region, a 10-year multi-donor Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy Program (ErfKE) for which the [[World Bank]] provided US$120 million.

Education is compulsory for all through the age of sixteen.\n\nMore than half of the Jordan population is below the age of 30 years. About 42.2 percent are 14 years or younger, whereas 31.4 percent fall between 15\u201329 years of age; almost one-third of the Jordanians are enrolled in educational facilities.

The private education sector accommodates more than 31.14 percent<ref>{{citation|title= Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Ministry of Education}}</ref> of the student population in the capital of Jordan, Amman. This sector is still heavily taxed, up to 25%++, although it takes a high burden off the government of the Kingdom, which makes school fees relatively high, starting at $1000, and going up to $7000. These values for private education fees are extremely high when compared to the average family incomes.\n\n====Secondary education====\nStudents in this education level, choosing the scientific stream, are required to take nine  subjects: Arabic, English, Mathematics,Computer Studies, Geology and Environment, Chemistry, Biology, Physics and Cultural Studies.While students choosing the classical stream, are required to take the following subjects: Arabic, Advanced Arabic, English, Mathematics, Computer Science, and History. Islamic studies are also mandatory for all students except for Christian students. However that there are reforms planned to the secondary education system from 2020 onwards that might alter the streams available and the list of subjects. \nThe secondary education level consists of two years' study for students aged 16 to 18 who have completed the basic cycle (ten years) and comprises two major tracks:\n* Secondary education (managed by the Ministry of Education), which can either be academic or vocational. At the end of the two-year period, students sit for the general secondary examination (Tawjihi) in the appropriate branch and those who pass are awarded the Tawjihi (General Secondary Education Certificate). The academic stream qualifies students for entrance to universities, whereas the vocational or technical type qualifies for entrance to Community Colleges or universities or the job market, provided they pass the two additional subjects.\n* Applied secondary education (managed by the Vocational Training corporation<ref name=\"UNEVOC\"/>), which provides intensive vocational training and apprenticeship, and leads to the award of a certificate (not the Tawjihi). Practical training is made through apprenticeship, and not in school workshops as in vocational secondary education.<ref name=\"UNEVOC\"/>\n[[File:Female students in Jordan on field trip at Jerash souvenir shops.jpg|left|thumb|Female secondary students on a field trip to [[Jerash]]|alt=A group of young women, most in oversized green tunics and some wearing headscarves, in a bazaar.

The Agency provides basic education free of charge to all Palestinian refugee children in its area of operations, which includes Jordan. There are also vocational training courses provided in eight training centers, two of which are in Jordan, and have been in operation for the past four decades. The Agency has established an Institute of Education, which is headquartered in Amman, to provide training to the UNRWA teaching staff.\n\nIn Jordan, not all refugee children attend UNRWA schools. Most Palestinian refugees have access to government schools and many of them choose to send their children there.\nMost of the UNRWA schools run on more than a single shift. Approximately 83 percent of UNRWA elementary schools and 62 percent of UNRWA preparatory schools are operated in full double shifts. The Jordan Field has the highest percentage of double shift schools, averaging about 93 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/unrwa/programmes/education/index.html|title=United Nations Relief and Works Agency(UNRWA)|access-date=2017-06-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811180328/http://www.un.org/unrwa/programmes/education/index.html|archive-date=2009-08-11|url-status=live}}</ref> The total refugee pupil enrollment in Jordan at various education levels is the following:\n\n'''Total Refugee Pupil Enrollment in Jordan distributed by Education Level and School'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|School Authority\n|Elementary Level\n|Preparatory Level\n|Secondary Level\n|-\n| UNRWA School\n| 86,931\n| 54,283\n| 0\n|-\n| Government School\n| 38,180\n| 25,938\n| 2,943\n|-\n| Private School\n| 2,616\n| 1,347\n| 18,488\n|-\n|Total\n| 127,727\n| 81,558\n| 21,431\n| 230,716\n|}\n''*''Enrollment figures of refugee pupils in government and private schools are believed to be incomplete, since refugee pupils lack incentives to report their status if and when requested.\n\n==Higher education==\n{{See also|Academic ranks in Jordan}}\n\nJust over 2.5% of Jordan's total population is enrolled at university, a proportion comparable to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/website/travel/Destination/content/default.aspx?titleid=87&xid=idh124603328_0006|title=Rough Guides -|work=Rough Guides|access-date=2009-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628115633/http://www.roughguides.com/website/travel/destination/content/default.aspx?titleid=87&xid=idh124603328_0006|archive-date=2009-06-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\nAccess to higher education is open to holders of the General Secondary Education Certificate who can then choose between private Community Colleges, public Community Colleges or universities (public and private). The credit-hour system, which entitles students to select courses according to a study plan, is implemented at universities.\n\nHigher education system of the country has evolved considerably. In years between 2000/2001 and 2006/2007, Jordan has seen an increased demand for higher education with enrollments growing at an annual rate of 14 percent from 77,841 to 218,900 students.  It has tertiary gross enrollment levels of about 40 percent which is higher than the regional average. Three new public universities have been established recently reaching a total of 10 public universities in the country.\n\nPrivate universities have seen a rapid increase in enrollments as well. Since 2000 to 2006, enrollment in 12 private universities grew by about 18 percent annually from 36,642 to 55,744. However, enrollment numbers in community colleges declined from 30,000 to 26,215. This decrease in enrollment rates reflect a bias to a 4-year university education and also the fact that quality and level of training given in these colleges is not what is in demand in the labor market of a knowledge based economy. With increasing number of students going for the attainment of higher education, the government needs to allocate greater resources in improving the current higher education system and also to improve access of good universities for the rising population. Even the private universities have to change some of their admission policies. The enrollment cap in the private universities restricts the ability of university to absorb increasing number of higher education students. Projection for the number of students entering university is 92,000 per year by 2013 up from 50,469 in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/04/30/000350881_20090430095054/Rendered/PDF/468230PAD0P102101Official0Use0Only1.pdf|title=World Bank 2009.\"Higher Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy Project.\"  Project Appraisal Document.

Bachelor's Degrees normally take four years. In Dentistry, Pharmacy and Engineering, studies last for five years. In Medicine, they last for six years, followed by an Internship which lasts for one year. The bachelor's degree requires a total of 126-257 credit hours, depending on the field of study.\n\n\u2022\tSecond stage: Postgraduate level\n\nA Master's degree is awarded after a further one to two years' study following a bachelor's degree. It can be obtained either by course work and a thesis (c. 24 credit hours of courses and nine credit hours of research), or by course work (c. 33 credit hours) and a comprehensive examination. There are other postgraduate degrees equivalent to the master's degree in some Jordanian universities like the Magister in the German Jordanian University, the DEA's degree in the Universities which follow the French system and the MBA for the students who have significant work experience.\n\n\u2022\tThird stage: Doctorate\n\nA Doctorate Degree is awarded after three to five years of further study and the submission of an original dissertation. It requires, depending on the subject, 24 credit hours of course work and 24 credit hours of research.\n\n\u2022\tTeacher education: Training of pre-primary and primary/basic school teachers\n\nBasic schoolteachers must hold a bachelor's degree. Training of secondary school teachers: Secondary school teachers must hold a bachelor's degree and a one-year postgraduate Higher Diploma in Education. Training of higher education teachers: They must hold a Doctorate (PhD). In some cases a master's degree is sufficient.\n\n\u2022\tNon-traditional studies: Distance higher education\n\nThis type of education is offered at the newly established branch of the Arab Open University.\n\n==Non-University Level Studies==\nNon-university and vocational studies are offered in community colleges, access to which is open to holders of all types of general secondary education certificates. The two-to three-year programme encompasses many fields, such as Arts, Science, Management, Business Administration and Engineering. As of 1997, all public Community Colleges are under the supervision of Al-Balqa Applied University. At the end of the two- or three-year course, students sit for a comprehensive examination (Al-Shamel). Those who pass are awarded the associate degree / Diploma.\n\n==Lifelong Higher Education==\nLifelong education is offered at public and private universities, public and private community colleges, the [[Jordan Institute of Public Administration]], The [[Royal Jordan Geographic Center]] and The [[Royal Scientific Society]], as well as in other institutions. Courses are offered in Engineering, Industry, Agriculture, Foreign Languages, Computer Sciences, Managerial Sciences, Secretarial Studies, Physical Education and subjects that can help the local community. Courses last between one week and six months at the end of which students obtain a Certificate of Attendance or Achievement. The qualifications required for admission depend on the subject and level of the course. Some are designed for specific occupations, in which case a work experience in the relevant field is needed to attend such courses, such as the books of Nadia Saqer.\n\n==Challenges==\n\nJordan, despite showing impressive improvement in the education system, continues to face persistent problems in this sector. With a rising youth population, the Jordanian government has to ensure that the quality of education and level of skills imparted can help the new generation to compete effectively on a national and international scale. Currently, the biggest challenge is the increase of population due to refugee influx, which has put pressure on Jordan's schools and universities. A recent school utilization study indicates that the number of Ministry of Education students is expected to increase by 124,634 between 2008 and 2013. To accommodate the rise in students, additional 3,360 classrooms will be needed during this time period. The same study reveals an uneven provision of educational infrastructure. In the Kingdom there exists concurrently excess capacity and wide-scale overcrowding of the schools.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/05/04/000333038_20090504003729/Rendered/PDF/468240PAD0P105101Official0Use0Only1.pdf|title= World Bank. 2009. \"Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy II.\" Project Information Document.

Jordan has the highest ratio of researchers in [[research and development|Research and Development]] among all 57 [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) member states. In Jordan, there are 8060 researchers per million people, higher than the [[European Union|EU]] average of 6494, and much higher than the world average of 2532 per million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sesric.org/files/article/394.pdf|title=RESEARCH AND SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT IN OIC COUNTRIES|access-date=2018-01-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808043707/http://www.sesric.org/files/article/394.pdf|archive-date=2019-08-08|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nJordan provides a higher proportion of its public budget for education than most countries in the world. In 2003, the share of the budget allocated to education was 6.4% of total government expenditure; education spending as a percentage of GDP was 13.5% in the same year. Jordan had one of the highest literacy rates in world at about 97.9% in 2012, which increased to 98.01% in 2015, and is expected to reach almost 100% by 2020. The primary gross enrollment ratio has reached 100% by 2007 for both girls and boys combined.

[[Jordan]] ranks number one in the Arab World in education. The Jordanian Ministry of Education is now making it mandatory for students to be computer literate and able to apply their studies in computers to their regular studies, most especially the scientific and mathematical courses. Jordan's educational system meets international standards and its secondary education diploma is accepted in world-class universities.\n\n==Education Reform Efforts==\nThe recent education reforms started in the early 1990s. This reform process was accelerated under His Majesty [[King Abdullah II]] in early 2001 with a vision to make Jordan the regional technology hub and an active player in the global economy.\nThe National Vision and Mission for Education, as developed and endorsed in late 2002, states the desired direction for general education in the country. The two major consultative documents, that helped shape the national vision and also set directions for educational reform initiatives, were Jordan Vision 2020 and the 2002 Vision Forum for the Future of Education. These documents spanned kindergarten to lifelong continuing education. The overall strategy proposed by the Forum was endorsed by the Economic Consultative Council (ECC) in October 2002. The national development strategy and the Forum results were consolidated into specific development plans, the Social and Economic Transformation Plan, the General Education Plan 2003-08.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/05/04/000333038_20090504003729/Rendered/PDF/468240PAD0P105101Official0Use0Only1.pdf\n|title= World Bank 2009. \"Education Reform for Knowledge Economy II Project.\" Project Appraisal Document.pp4\n|access-date= 2009-12-28\n|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202600/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/05/04/000333038_20090504003729/Rendered/PDF/468240PAD0P105101Official0Use0Only1.pdf\n|archive-date= 2016-03-03\n|url-status= live\n}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2003, the Government of Jordan launched one of the most ambitious programs in the entire MENA region, a 10-year multi-donor Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy Program (ErfKE) for which the [[World Bank]] provided US$120 million. The goal of the program was to bring the country's educational policies and programs in line with the demands of a knowledge based economy, improve the physical learning environment in most schools, and promote early childhood education.

The aim of this program was to strengthen and institutionalize the reforms introduced under ERfKE I, with a particular focus on school level implementation and teacher quality. It will strengthen the institutional capacity of MoE in policy, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, and improve teacher employment, utilization and professional development policies and implementation. The program also aimed to fine tune the curriculum and student assessment to ensure alignment with a knowledge based economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/EXTMNASUMMNSHD/0,,contentMDK:22116832~pagePK:51246584~piPK:51241019~theSitePK:2013988,00.html|title=World Bank MENA external website|access-date=2009-06-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427052505/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/EXTMNASUMMNSHD/0,,contentMDK:22116832~pagePK:51246584~piPK:51241019~theSitePK:2013988,00.html|archive-date=2017-04-27|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nJordan Education Initiative recently received the UNESCO prize for ICT use in Education.

Study books are standard books distributed by the Ministry of Education. Education is compulsory for all through the age of sixteen.\n\nMore than half of the Jordan population is below the age of 30 years. About 42.2 percent are 14 years or younger, whereas 31.4 percent fall between 15\u201329 years of age; almost one-third of the Jordanians are enrolled in educational facilities.

The private education sector accommodates more than 31.14 percent<ref>{{citation|title= Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Ministry of Education}}</ref> of the student population in the capital of Jordan, Amman. This sector is still heavily taxed, up to 25%++, although it takes a high burden off the government of the Kingdom, which makes school fees relatively high, starting at $1000, and going up to $7000. These values for private education fees are extremely high when compared to the average family incomes.\n\n====Secondary education====\nStudents in this education level, choosing the scientific stream, are required to take nine  subjects: Arabic, English, Mathematics,Computer Studies, Geology and Environment, Chemistry, Biology, Physics and Cultural Studies.While students choosing the classical stream, are required to take the following subjects: Arabic, Advanced Arabic, English, Mathematics, Computer Science, and History. Islamic studies are also mandatory for all students except for Christian students. However that there are reforms planned to the secondary education system from 2020 onwards that might alter the streams available and the list of subjects. \nThe secondary education level consists of two years' study for students aged 16 to 18 who have completed the basic cycle (ten years) and comprises two major tracks:\n* Secondary education (managed by the Ministry of Education), which can either be academic or vocational. At the end of the two-year period, students sit for the general secondary examination (Tawjihi) in the appropriate branch and those who pass are awarded the Tawjihi (General Secondary Education Certificate). The academic stream qualifies students for entrance to universities, whereas the vocational or technical type qualifies for entrance to Community Colleges or universities or the job market, provided they pass the two additional subjects.\n* Applied secondary education (managed by the Vocational Training corporation<ref name=\"UNEVOC\"/>), which provides intensive vocational training and apprenticeship, and leads to the award of a certificate (not the Tawjihi). Practical training is made through apprenticeship, and not in school workshops as in vocational secondary education.<ref name=\"UNEVOC\"/>\n[[File:Female students in Jordan on field trip at Jerash souvenir shops.jpg|left|thumb|Female secondary students on a field trip to [[Jerash]]|alt=A group of young women, most in oversized green tunics and some wearing headscarves, in a bazaar.

The Agency provides basic education free of charge to all Palestinian refugee children in its area of operations, which includes Jordan. There are also vocational training courses provided in eight training centers, two of which are in Jordan, and have been in operation for the past four decades. The Agency has established an Institute of Education, which is headquartered in Amman, to provide training to the UNRWA teaching staff.\n\nIn Jordan, not all refugee children attend UNRWA schools. Most Palestinian refugees have access to government schools and many of them choose to send their children there.\nMost of the UNRWA schools run on more than a single shift. Approximately 83 percent of UNRWA elementary schools and 62 percent of UNRWA preparatory schools are operated in full double shifts. The Jordan Field has the highest percentage of double shift schools, averaging about 93 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/unrwa/programmes/education/index.html|title=United Nations Relief and Works Agency(UNRWA)|access-date=2017-06-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811180328/http://www.un.org/unrwa/programmes/education/index.html|archive-date=2009-08-11|url-status=live}}</ref> The total refugee pupil enrollment in Jordan at various education levels is the following:\n\n'''Total Refugee Pupil Enrollment in Jordan distributed by Education Level and School'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|School Authority\n|Elementary Level\n|Preparatory Level\n|Secondary Level\n|-\n| UNRWA School\n| 86,931\n| 54,283\n| 0\n|-\n| Government School\n| 38,180\n| 25,938\n| 2,943\n|-\n| Private School\n| 2,616\n| 1,347\n| 18,488\n|-\n|Total\n| 127,727\n| 81,558\n| 21,431\n| 230,716\n|}\n''*''Enrollment figures of refugee pupils in government and private schools are believed to be incomplete, since refugee pupils lack incentives to report their status if and when requested.\n\n==Higher education==\n{{See also|Academic ranks in Jordan}}\n\nJust over 2.5% of Jordan's total population is enrolled at university, a proportion comparable to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/website/travel/Destination/content/default.aspx?titleid=87&xid=idh124603328_0006|title=Rough Guides -|work=Rough Guides|access-date=2009-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628115633/http://www.roughguides.com/website/travel/destination/content/default.aspx?titleid=87&xid=idh124603328_0006|archive-date=2009-06-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\nAccess to higher education is open to holders of the General Secondary Education Certificate who can then choose between private Community Colleges, public Community Colleges or universities (public and private). The credit-hour system, which entitles students to select courses according to a study plan, is implemented at universities.\n\nHigher education system of the country has evolved considerably. In years between 2000/2001 and 2006/2007, Jordan has seen an increased demand for higher education with enrollments growing at an annual rate of 14 percent from 77,841 to 218,900 students.  It has tertiary gross enrollment levels of about 40 percent which is higher than the regional average. Three new public universities have been established recently reaching a total of 10 public universities in the country.\n\nPrivate universities have seen a rapid increase in enrollments as well. Since 2000 to 2006, enrollment in 12 private universities grew by about 18 percent annually from 36,642 to 55,744. However, enrollment numbers in community colleges declined from 30,000 to 26,215. This decrease in enrollment rates reflect a bias to a 4-year university education and also the fact that quality and level of training given in these colleges is not what is in demand in the labor market of a knowledge based economy. With increasing number of students going for the attainment of higher education, the government needs to allocate greater resources in improving the current higher education system and also to improve access of good universities for the rising population. Even the private universities have to change some of their admission policies. The enrollment cap in the private universities restricts the ability of university to absorb increasing number of higher education students. Projection for the number of students entering university is 92,000 per year by 2013 up from 50,469 in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/04/30/000350881_20090430095054/Rendered/PDF/468230PAD0P102101Official0Use0Only1.pdf|title=World Bank 2009.\"Higher Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy Project.\"  Project Appraisal Document.

Bachelor's Degrees normally take four years. In Dentistry, Pharmacy and Engineering, studies last for five years. In Medicine, they last for six years, followed by an Internship which lasts for one year. The bachelor's degree requires a total of 126-257 credit hours, depending on the field of study.\n\n\u2022\tSecond stage: Postgraduate level\n\nA Master's degree is awarded after a further one to two years' study following a bachelor's degree. It can be obtained either by course work and a thesis (c. 24 credit hours of courses and nine credit hours of research), or by course work (c. 33 credit hours) and a comprehensive examination. There are other postgraduate degrees equivalent to the master's degree in some Jordanian universities like the Magister in the German Jordanian University, the DEA's degree in the Universities which follow the French system and the MBA for the students who have significant work experience.\n\n\u2022\tThird stage: Doctorate\n\nA Doctorate Degree is awarded after three to five years of further study and the submission of an original dissertation. It requires, depending on the subject, 24 credit hours of course work and 24 credit hours of research.\n\n\u2022\tTeacher education: Training of pre-primary and primary/basic school teachers\n\nBasic schoolteachers must hold a bachelor's degree. Training of secondary school teachers: Secondary school teachers must hold a bachelor's degree and a one-year postgraduate Higher Diploma in Education. Training of higher education teachers: They must hold a Doctorate (PhD). In some cases a master's degree is sufficient.\n\n\u2022\tNon-traditional studies: Distance higher education\n\nThis type of education is offered at the newly established branch of the Arab Open University.\n\n==Non-University Level Studies==\nNon-university and vocational studies are offered in community colleges, access to which is open to holders of all types of general secondary education certificates. The two-to three-year programme encompasses many fields, such as Arts, Science, Management, Business Administration and Engineering. As of 1997, all public Community Colleges are under the supervision of Al-Balqa Applied University. At the end of the two- or three-year course, students sit for a comprehensive examination (Al-Shamel). Those who pass are awarded the associate degree / Diploma.\n\n==Lifelong Higher Education==\nLifelong education is offered at public and private universities, public and private community colleges, the [[Jordan Institute of Public Administration]], The [[Royal Jordan Geographic Center]] and The [[Royal Scientific Society]], as well as in other institutions. Courses are offered in Engineering, Industry, Agriculture, Foreign Languages, Computer Sciences, Managerial Sciences, Secretarial Studies, Physical Education and subjects that can help the local community. Courses last between one week and six months at the end of which students obtain a Certificate of Attendance or Achievement. The qualifications required for admission depend on the subject and level of the course. Some are designed for specific occupations, in which case a work experience in the relevant field is needed to attend such courses, such as the books of Nadia Saqer.\n\n==Challenges==\n\nJordan, despite showing impressive improvement in the education system, continues to face persistent problems in this sector. With a rising youth population, the Jordanian government has to ensure that the quality of education and level of skills imparted can help the new generation to compete effectively on a national and international scale. Currently, the biggest challenge is the increase of population due to refugee influx, which has put pressure on Jordan's schools and universities. A recent school utilization study indicates that the number of Ministry of Education students is expected to increase by 124,634 between 2008 and 2013.

She stated, \"they were related because they were mine but they weren\u2019t related in one completing the other.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|last1=Corby|first1=Vanessa|title=New Encounters: Arts, Cultures, Concepts: Eva Hesse: Longing, Belonging, and Displacement|date=2010|publisher=Tauris|location=London, UK|page=16}}</ref>\n\nHesse\u2019s interest in latex as a medium for sculptural forms had to do with immediacy. Art critic John Keats stated: \"immediacy may be one of the prime reasons Hesse was attracted to latex\".<ref name=\"Mar 2011\"/> Hesse\u2019s first two works using latex, ''Schema'' and ''Sequel'' (1967\u201368), use latex in a way never imagined by the manufacturer. In her artwork ''Untitled (Rope Piece)'', Hesse employed industrial latex and once it was hardened, she hung it on the wall and ceiling using wire.\"Industrial latex was meant for casting. Hesse handled it like house paint, brushing layer upon layer to build up a surface that was smooth yet irregular, ragged at the edges like deckled paper.\" <ref name=\"Mar 2011\"/>\n\nHesse's work often employs multiple forms of similar shapes organized together in grid structures or clusters. Retaining some of the defining forms of [[minimalism]], modularity, and the use of unconventional materials, she created eccentric work that was repetitive and labor-intensive. Her work ''Contingent'' from 1968 is an ideal example of this concept. And in a statement on her work, Hesse described her piece entitled ''Hang-Up'' as \"...the first time my idea of absurdity or extreme feeling came through...The whole thing is absolutely rigid, neat cord around the entire thing . . . It is extreme and that is why I like it and don't like it . . . It is the most ridiculous structure that I ever made and that is why it is really good\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Irving|title=Art of The Postmodern Era|date=1996|publisher=HarperCollins|location=NY|isbn=0-06-438509-4|page=29|edition=first}}</ref>\n\n==Postminimalism and feminism==\nEva Hesse is associated with the [[Postminimal]] [[art movement]]. [[Arthur Danto]] distinguished post-minimalism from minimalism by its \"mirth and jokiness,\" its \"unmistakable whiff of eroticism,\" and its \"nonmechanical repetition.\"<ref name=Danto-33>Danto, 2006, p. 33.</ref>\n\nShe worked and sometimes competed with her male counterparts in post-minimalist art, a primarily male-dominated movement.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoops|first1=Susan|title=More Than Minimal: Feminism and Abstraction in the 70's|url=https://archive.org/details/morethanminimalf00stoo|year=1996|publisher=Brandeis University|location=Waltham, MA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/morethanminimalf00stoo/page/54 54\u201359]}}</ref> Many feminist art historians have noted how her work successfully illuminates women\u2019s issues while refraining from any obvious political agenda. She revealed, in a letter to Ethelyn Honig (1965), that a woman is \"at disadvantage from the beginning\u2026 She lacks conviction that she has the \u2018right\u2019 to achievement. She also lacks the belief that her achievements are worthy\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art|last=Stiles|first=Kristine|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|location=Berkeley, CA|page=705}}</ref> She continued to explain that, \u201ca fantastic strength is necessary and courage. I dwell on this all the time. My determination and will are strong but I am lacking so in self-esteem that I never seem to overcome.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> She denied her work was strictly feminist, defending it as feminine but without feminist statements in mind. In an interview with Cindy Nemser for ''Woman's Art Journal'' (1970), she stated, \"Excellence has no sex.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nemser|first1=Cindy|title=My Memories of Eva Hesse|journal=Woman's Art Journal|date=2007|volume=28|issue=1|page=27|publisher=Old City Publishing, Inc.|jstor=20358108}}</ref>\n\n==Visual and critical analysis==\nHesse's work often shows minimal physical manipulation of a material while simultaneously completely transforming the meaning it conveys. This simplicity and complexity has evoked controversy among art historians. Debate has focussed on which pieces should be considered complete and finished works, and which are studies, sketches, or models for future works.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwabsky|first1=Barry|title=Eva Hesse|journal=Artforum|date=2010|issue=April|pages=205\u2013206|publisher=Camden Arts Centre}}</ref> Hesse's drawings have often been noted as drafts for later sculptures, but Hesse herself disavowed any strong connection.<ref name=\":1\" /> Her work is often described as anti-form, ie a resistance to uniformity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Danto|first1=Arthur|title=All About Eva|journal=The Nation|date=2006|volume=24|issue=July|pages=30\u201333}}</ref> Her work embodies elements of minimalism in its simple shapes, delicate lines, and limited color palette.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fer|first1=Briony|title=Bordering on Blank: Eva Hesse and Minimalism|date=1994|volume=17|issue=3|pages=424\u2013449|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Oxford|issn=0141-6790|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8365.1994.tb00586.x|journal=Art History}}</ref> [[Barry Schwabsky]] described her work for the Camden Arts Centre in London: \"Things folded, things piled, things twisted, things wound and unwound; tangled things, blunt things to connect to; materials that have a congealed look, materials that seem lost or discarded or mistreated; shapes that look like they should have been made of flesh and shapes, that look like they might be made of flesh but should not have been \u2013 you can look at these things, these materials, these shapes, and feel the shudder of an unnamable nanosensation, or you can let your eye pass by them without reaction; maybe you can do both at once.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwabsky|first1=Barry|title=Eva Hesse|journal=Artforum|date=2010|issue=April|page=206|publisher=Camden Arts Centre}}</ref> All of her work, and especially her drawings, are based on repetition and simple progressions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Ellen|title=Eva Hesse|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hesse-untitled-t04151|website=Tate Britain|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Preservation of artworks==\nThere has been ongoing discussion about how best to preserve Eva Hesse\u2019s sculptures. With the exception of fiberglass, most of her favored materials have aged badly, so much of her work presents conservators with an enormous challenge. [[Arthur Danto]], writing of the Jewish Museum's 2006 retrospective, refers to \"the discolorations, the slackness in the membrane-like latex, the palpable aging of the material\u2026 Yet, somehow the work does not feel tragic. Instead, it is full of life, of eros, even of comedy\u2026 Each piece in the show vibrates with originality and mischief.\"<ref>Danto, 2006, p.30\u201331.</ref>\n\nIn some cases, her work is damaged beyond presentation. For instance, ''Sans III'' can no longer be exhibited to the public because the latex boxes have curled in on themselves and crumbled. Hesse\u2019s close friend [[Sol LeWitt]] argued for steps for active conservation, \"She wanted her work to last ... She certainly didn't have the attitude that she would mutely sit by and let it disintegrate before her eyes.\"<ref name=\"Mar 2011\">Keats, John. \"The Afterlife of Eva Hesse.\" Art & Antiques Magazine. Art & Antiques Magazine, March 31, 2011; accessed March 4, 2015.</ref> LeWitt's response is supported by many of Hesse\u2019s other friends and colleagues. However, Hesse\u2019s dedication to material and process contradicts her intention for these works to attain permanency. When discussing this topic with collectors in mind, she wrote, \"At this point, I feel a little guilty when people want to buy it. I think they know but I want to write them a letter and say it's not going to last. I am not sure what my stand on lasting really is. Part of me feels that it\u2019s superfluous and if I need to use rubber that is more important. Life doesn\u2019t last; art doesn't last.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Danto|first1=Arthur|title=All About Eva|journal=The Nation|date=2006|volume=17|issue=24|page=32}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHer art is often viewed in the context of the many struggles of her life. This includes escaping from the Nazis, her parents' divorce, the suicide of her mother when she was 10, her failed marriage, and the death of her father. A 2016 documentary entitled ''Eva Hesse'', premiered in New York, illustrated her painful background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news/shoot/portrait-artist-young-woman-documenting-innovation-and-influence-eva-hesse/614744|title=Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman: Documenting the Innovation and Influence of Eva Hesse|last=Wolfe|first=Jennifer|date=2016-06-27|publisher=Creative Planet Network|accessdate=2016-08-22}}</ref> Directed by Marcie Begleiter, the film tells the story of Hesse's \"tragically foreshortened life\". It \"focuses on those years of artistic emergence, a period of rapid development and furious productivity, with few parallels in the history of art.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/movies/review-eva-hesse-documentary.html|title=Review: 'Eva Hesse' Offers a Moving Portrait of an Artist's Brief Life|last=Scott|first=A.O.|date=2016-04-26|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Eva Hesse Documentary |url=https://www.evahessedoc.com |website=Eva Hesse Documentary}}</ref>\n\nWhile experiences no doubt had profound impressions on Hesse, the true impact of her artwork has been her formal, artistic invention: for example, her inventive uses of material, her contemporary response to the [[minimalist]] movement, and her ability to usher in the postmodern and postminimalist art movements. Arthur Danto connects the two by describing her as \"cop[ing] with emotional chaos by reinventing sculpture through aesthetic insubordination, playing with worthless material amid the industrial ruins of a defeated nation that, only two decades earlier, would have murdered her without a second thought.\"<ref name=Danto-33/>\n\nHesse was among the first artists of the 1960s to experiment with the fluid contours of the organic world of nature, as well as the simplest of artistic gestures. Some observers see in these qualities latent, proto-feminist references to the female body; others find in Hesse's languid forms expressions of wit, whimsy, and a sense of spontaneous invention with casually found, or \"everyday\" materials.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-hesse-eva.htm|title=Eva Hesse Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}</ref> Prominent artists that have noted her as a primary influence include Japanese artist [[Eiji Sumi]] <ref>http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/292461/</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions==\nIn 1961, Hesse's gouache paintings were exhibited in Brooklyn Museum\u2019s ''21st International Watercolor Biennial''.

Hesse handled it like house paint, brushing layer upon layer to build up a surface that was smooth yet irregular, ragged at the edges like deckled paper.\" <ref name=\"Mar 2011\"/>\n\nHesse's work often employs multiple forms of similar shapes organized together in grid structures or clusters. Retaining some of the defining forms of [[minimalism]], modularity, and the use of unconventional materials, she created eccentric work that was repetitive and labor-intensive. Her work ''Contingent'' from 1968 is an ideal example of this concept. And in a statement on her work, Hesse described her piece entitled ''Hang-Up'' as \"...the first time my idea of absurdity or extreme feeling came through...The whole thing is absolutely rigid, neat cord around the entire thing . . . It is extreme and that is why I like it and don't like it . . . It is the most ridiculous structure that I ever made and that is why it is really good\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Irving|title=Art of The Postmodern Era|date=1996|publisher=HarperCollins|location=NY|isbn=0-06-438509-4|page=29|edition=first}}</ref>\n\n==Postminimalism and feminism==\nEva Hesse is associated with the [[Postminimal]] [[art movement]]. [[Arthur Danto]] distinguished post-minimalism from minimalism by its \"mirth and jokiness,\" its \"unmistakable whiff of eroticism,\" and its \"nonmechanical repetition.\"<ref name=Danto-33>Danto, 2006, p. 33.</ref>\n\nShe worked and sometimes competed with her male counterparts in post-minimalist art, a primarily male-dominated movement.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoops|first1=Susan|title=More Than Minimal: Feminism and Abstraction in the 70's|url=https://archive.org/details/morethanminimalf00stoo|year=1996|publisher=Brandeis University|location=Waltham, MA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/morethanminimalf00stoo/page/54 54\u201359]}}</ref> Many feminist art historians have noted how her work successfully illuminates women\u2019s issues while refraining from any obvious political agenda. She revealed, in a letter to Ethelyn Honig (1965), that a woman is \"at disadvantage from the beginning\u2026 She lacks conviction that she has the \u2018right\u2019 to achievement. She also lacks the belief that her achievements are worthy\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art|last=Stiles|first=Kristine|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|location=Berkeley, CA|page=705}}</ref> She continued to explain that, \u201ca fantastic strength is necessary and courage. I dwell on this all the time. My determination and will are strong but I am lacking so in self-esteem that I never seem to overcome.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> She denied her work was strictly feminist, defending it as feminine but without feminist statements in mind. In an interview with Cindy Nemser for ''Woman's Art Journal'' (1970), she stated, \"Excellence has no sex.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nemser|first1=Cindy|title=My Memories of Eva Hesse|journal=Woman's Art Journal|date=2007|volume=28|issue=1|page=27|publisher=Old City Publishing, Inc.|jstor=20358108}}</ref>\n\n==Visual and critical analysis==\nHesse's work often shows minimal physical manipulation of a material while simultaneously completely transforming the meaning it conveys. This simplicity and complexity has evoked controversy among art historians. Debate has focussed on which pieces should be considered complete and finished works, and which are studies, sketches, or models for future works.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwabsky|first1=Barry|title=Eva Hesse|journal=Artforum|date=2010|issue=April|pages=205\u2013206|publisher=Camden Arts Centre}}</ref> Hesse's drawings have often been noted as drafts for later sculptures, but Hesse herself disavowed any strong connection.<ref name=\":1\" /> Her work is often described as anti-form, ie a resistance to uniformity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Danto|first1=Arthur|title=All About Eva|journal=The Nation|date=2006|volume=24|issue=July|pages=30\u201333}}</ref> Her work embodies elements of minimalism in its simple shapes, delicate lines, and limited color palette.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fer|first1=Briony|title=Bordering on Blank: Eva Hesse and Minimalism|date=1994|volume=17|issue=3|pages=424\u2013449|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Oxford|issn=0141-6790|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8365.1994.tb00586.x|journal=Art History}}</ref> [[Barry Schwabsky]] described her work for the Camden Arts Centre in London: \"Things folded, things piled, things twisted, things wound and unwound; tangled things, blunt things to connect to; materials that have a congealed look, materials that seem lost or discarded or mistreated; shapes that look like they should have been made of flesh and shapes, that look like they might be made of flesh but should not have been \u2013 you can look at these things, these materials, these shapes, and feel the shudder of an unnamable nanosensation, or you can let your eye pass by them without reaction; maybe you can do both at once.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwabsky|first1=Barry|title=Eva Hesse|journal=Artforum|date=2010|issue=April|page=206|publisher=Camden Arts Centre}}</ref> All of her work, and especially her drawings, are based on repetition and simple progressions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Ellen|title=Eva Hesse|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hesse-untitled-t04151|website=Tate Britain|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Preservation of artworks==\nThere has been ongoing discussion about how best to preserve Eva Hesse\u2019s sculptures. With the exception of fiberglass, most of her favored materials have aged badly, so much of her work presents conservators with an enormous challenge. [[Arthur Danto]], writing of the Jewish Museum's 2006 retrospective, refers to \"the discolorations, the slackness in the membrane-like latex, the palpable aging of the material\u2026 Yet, somehow the work does not feel tragic. Instead, it is full of life, of eros, even of comedy\u2026 Each piece in the show vibrates with originality and mischief.\"<ref>Danto, 2006, p.30\u201331.</ref>\n\nIn some cases, her work is damaged beyond presentation. For instance, ''Sans III'' can no longer be exhibited to the public because the latex boxes have curled in on themselves and crumbled. Hesse\u2019s close friend [[Sol LeWitt]] argued for steps for active conservation, \"She wanted her work to last ... She certainly didn't have the attitude that she would mutely sit by and let it disintegrate before her eyes.\"<ref name=\"Mar 2011\">Keats, John. \"The Afterlife of Eva Hesse.\" Art & Antiques Magazine. Art & Antiques Magazine, March 31, 2011; accessed March 4, 2015.</ref> LeWitt's response is supported by many of Hesse\u2019s other friends and colleagues. However, Hesse\u2019s dedication to material and process contradicts her intention for these works to attain permanency. When discussing this topic with collectors in mind, she wrote, \"At this point, I feel a little guilty when people want to buy it. I think they know but I want to write them a letter and say it's not going to last. I am not sure what my stand on lasting really is. Part of me feels that it\u2019s superfluous and if I need to use rubber that is more important. Life doesn\u2019t last; art doesn't last.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Danto|first1=Arthur|title=All About Eva|journal=The Nation|date=2006|volume=17|issue=24|page=32}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHer art is often viewed in the context of the many struggles of her life. This includes escaping from the Nazis, her parents' divorce, the suicide of her mother when she was 10, her failed marriage, and the death of her father. A 2016 documentary entitled ''Eva Hesse'', premiered in New York, illustrated her painful background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news/shoot/portrait-artist-young-woman-documenting-innovation-and-influence-eva-hesse/614744|title=Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman: Documenting the Innovation and Influence of Eva Hesse|last=Wolfe|first=Jennifer|date=2016-06-27|publisher=Creative Planet Network|accessdate=2016-08-22}}</ref> Directed by Marcie Begleiter, the film tells the story of Hesse's \"tragically foreshortened life\". It \"focuses on those years of artistic emergence, a period of rapid development and furious productivity, with few parallels in the history of art.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/movies/review-eva-hesse-documentary.html|title=Review: 'Eva Hesse' Offers a Moving Portrait of an Artist's Brief Life|last=Scott|first=A.O.|date=2016-04-26|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Eva Hesse Documentary |url=https://www.evahessedoc.com |website=Eva Hesse Documentary}}</ref>\n\nWhile experiences no doubt had profound impressions on Hesse, the true impact of her artwork has been her formal, artistic invention: for example, her inventive uses of material, her contemporary response to the [[minimalist]] movement, and her ability to usher in the postmodern and postminimalist art movements. Arthur Danto connects the two by describing her as \"cop[ing] with emotional chaos by reinventing sculpture through aesthetic insubordination, playing with worthless material amid the industrial ruins of a defeated nation that, only two decades earlier, would have murdered her without a second thought.\"<ref name=Danto-33/>\n\nHesse was among the first artists of the 1960s to experiment with the fluid contours of the organic world of nature, as well as the simplest of artistic gestures. Some observers see in these qualities latent, proto-feminist references to the female body; others find in Hesse's languid forms expressions of wit, whimsy, and a sense of spontaneous invention with casually found, or \"everyday\" materials.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-hesse-eva.htm|title=Eva Hesse Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}</ref> Prominent artists that have noted her as a primary influence include Japanese artist [[Eiji Sumi]] <ref>http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/292461/</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions==\nIn 1961, Hesse's gouache paintings were exhibited in Brooklyn Museum\u2019s ''21st International Watercolor Biennial''. Simultaneously, she showed her drawings in the John Heller Gallery exhibition ''Drawings: Three Young Americans''.<ref name=\"Corby12\"/> In August 1962, she and Tom Doyle participated in an [[Allan Kaprow]] [[Happening]] at the [[Art Students League of New York]] in [[Woodstock, New York]]. In 1963, Hesse had a one-person show of works on paper at the Allan Stone Gallery on New York's [[Upper East Side]].<ref>Lippard 1992, p. 219</ref> Her first solo show of sculpture was presented at the Kunstverein f\u00fcr die Rheinlande und Westfalen, D\u00fcsseldorf, in 1965.<ref name=\"Eva Hesse\"/> In November 1968, she exhibited her large-scale sculptures at the [[Fischbach Gallery]] in New York.

These exhibitions took place at the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]] in London from May 4 \u2013 June 17, 1979; the [[Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum|Kroller-Muller]] in [[Otterlo]] from June 30 \u2013 August 5, 1979; and the Kestner-Gesellschaft in [[Hannover]] from August 17 \u2013 September 23, 1979. One artwork featured in the exhibition was ''Aught,'' four double sheets of latex stuffed with polyethylene.<ref>[Artforum, Summer 1979. Page 6]</ref> In 1982, [[Ellen H.
