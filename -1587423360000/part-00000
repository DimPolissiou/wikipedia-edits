Ideally, different levels of care are to be provided to best serve communities, as well as individuals. The philosophy behind this model maintains that individual psychological treatment and broad social interventions are both essential to overall mental wellbeing and resilience. It also acknowledges that most of a population require minimal psychosocial interventions in order to improve or prevent adverse mental health outcomes, which can be facilitated by mental health workers. However, those who experience impaired functioning due to severe emotional distress, or who require pharmaceutical treatment for an existing or developing condition would require more specialized services facilitated my more highly trained professionals, such as psychiatrists and psychologists.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Rohingya refugees settled in the Cox's Bazar region of Bangladesh are at risk for mental health issues due to a wide variety of factors, including prior history of systematic dehumanization, persecution, having witnessed or experienced traumatic events, and daily stressors of remaining in a refugee settlement. The history of the Rohingya located in the Rakhine State of Myanmar includes protracted social and economic exclusion, which ultimately escalated to extreme violence resulting in a mass exodus of up to an estimated 900,000 refugees to date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.searo.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2018/1680/en/|title=World Health Organization, Urgent need to scale up health services in Cox's Bazar: WHO|website=SEARO|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref> The traumatic events that have occurred in Rakhine State included burning of villages, arrests, torture, sexual assault, and loss of family and livelihoods.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Riley|first=Andrew|last2=Varner|first2=Andrea|last3=Ventevogel|first3=Peter|last4=Taimur Hasan|first4=M.

Efforts since the beginning of the crisis have focused on providing basic psychosocial training and non-specialized community interventions, including training in Psychological First Aid. Integrating MHPSS interventions and awareness in primary healthcare services have also been problematic, as providing adequate access to basic health services itself has been a challenge in the refugee camps due to a shortage in supplies, space, and staff.<ref name=\":0\" /> This integration continues to be a goal and efforts towards program implementation and training of healthcare professionals in the field have been an area of focus. However, the increases in the camp population, especially during the rapid population influx of an estimated 700,000 in 2017, only exacerbated these challenges. Furthermore, the resource-poor humanitarian efforts are suggested to increase negative psychological impacts by perpetuating anxiety, stress and depression and decreasing capacity for resilience.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAccording to a report published by the United Nations Higher Commissioner for Refugees ([[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]]), there have been few studies published on mental health concerns of the Rohingya refugee populations. Nonetheless, there are a concerning number of cases reported involving \u201cexplosive anger, psychotic-like symptoms, somatic or medically unexplained symptoms, impaired function and suicidal ideation,\u201d along with a documented history of reported high anxiety, hypervigilance, depression, and appetite loss within the population.<ref name=\":0\" /> The factors suggested to cause such prominent mental health concerns involve not only daily stressors of refugee living situations and the immediate trauma endured prior to arrival, but also due to protracted traumatic or stressful experience being persecuted in Rakhine State before fleeing.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe combination of the protracted refugee crisis with a history of stress, persecution and trauma is a cause for concern with the Rohingya and further investigation into the effects and treatments has been recommended. Furthermore, there have been obstacles with reporting mental health measurement results, including not having validated such measurements with the Rohingyas prior to research, as well as a substandard understanding of cultural idioms of distress. This allows for possible misinterpretation of mental health concerns if viewed and diagnosed by Western standards and definitions alone. Further evaluation into cultural idioms of distress, validity of results and continued research has been recommended by multiple involved agencies.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Food- and water-borne diseases ===\n[[File:Rohingya displaced Muslims 011.jpg|thumb|255x255px|Clean water and sanitation are scarce for many Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, especially in unregistered camps.<ref name=\":15\" />]]\nPoor infrastructure and sanitation in refugee camps place the Rohingya at increased risk for food- and water-borne diseases.

Rohingya refugees are often not vaccinated and there is worry that outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as polio, measles, and tetanus, will occur if living conditions are not improved.<ref name=\":7\" /> But the UN and the WHO, along with Bangladesh Government, were quick to begin mass vaccination of the population. Measles outbreak is a dangerous threat and in 2017, the WHO announced that 136,000 children under 15 years of age were vaccinated against measles and rubella. An oral [[polio vaccine]] was also given to 72,000 children. Permanent vaccination centers are in place to assist in the vaccination effort of children under the age of 2 years. In October 2017, a mass vaccination effort spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and partners provided 900,000 doses of oral [[cholera vaccine]] in two phases. More than 700,000 people over 1 year of age received a single dose during the first phase; in the second, an additional dose of the oral cholera vaccine was administered to 199,472 children ages 1 to 5 years. In addition, 236,696 children under 5 years of age were also vaccinated against polio.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.searo.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2017/1671/en/ |title = World Health Organization, Bangladesh steps up vaccination for new Rohingya arrivals as measles cases rise}}</ref> No new cases of cholera were detected in the 3 months following mass vaccination.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) malnutrition refers to deficiencies and excesses or imbalances in a person's intake of energy and/or nutrients and is a strong predictor of mortality in children that are 5 years and younger. In the refugee camps in Bangladesh, over 25% of Rohingya children are malnourished and over 12% are suffering from severe [[Stunted growth|stunting]], a condition resulting from starvation and malnutrition. Infants under 6 months are among the most vulnerable and have malnutrition rates near 50%.<ref name=\":6\" /> This is in part due to mothers lack of ability to provide breast milk due to their own lack of nutrition. Refugees are dependent on humanitarian aid and while efforts to combat malnutrition are underway, there is still an alarming rate of malnutrition. Efforts in Bangladesh and other surrounding countries by UNICEF, Action Against Hunger and other aid relief are helping to provide food and water.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/13/quarter-rohingya-refugee-children-malnourished/|title=Rohingya refugee crisis: A quarter of children are malnourished|last=Gulland|first=Anne|date=13 April 2018|work=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Rohingya refugee children are facing a high risk of death considering the WHO refers to malnutrition as critical issue when rates reach 15%. \u00a0Acute malnutrition in the refugees exceeds levels between 24.5%-26.5%.<ref name=\":1\" /> Malnutrition is well above emergency levels. Of the thousands of  children that have fled to Bangladesh, chronic malnutrition is prevalent in around 60% of Rohingya children in Bangladesh.\n\nThere are many factors that play a role in the alarming rates of malnutrition among Rohingya refugee children including food security, infectious disease, poor sanitary conditions and contaminated water. Food security is a specific concern since only 6% of refugees report having acceptable food consumption scores.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/malnutrition-rates-among-rohingya-refugee-children-bangladesh-appear-be-least-double|title=Malnutrition rates among Rohingya refugee children in Bangladesh appear to be at least double earlier estimates|last=LeMoyne|date=3 November 2017|website=www.unicef.org|language=en}}</ref> There are still refugees arriving at Cox's Bazar from Myanmar, creating an even greater lack of already very limited resources. A major upcoming concern for the refugees is the potential threat of the rainy season. This has the potential to cause flooding, leading to contaminated water and infectious disease, thus resulting in higher rates of malnutrition.<ref name=\":9\" /> They are in need of huge amounts of nutrient rich foods to reduce the risk of malnutrition rates increasing.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Reproductive health ===\nThe Rohingya refugee crisis has made Rohingya women more vulnerable. Currently, Rohingya women make up approximately 67% of the refugee population and are victims of sexual violence and exploitation.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first=Susan|date=2018-01-02|title=Gendered insecurity in the Rohingya crisis|journal=Australian Journal of International Affairs|language=en|volume=72|issue=1|pages=1\u20139|doi=10.1080/10357718.2017.1402291|issn=1035-7718}}</ref> Of the 335,670 female refugees in the population, 70,000 (20%) are estimated to be pregnant or new mothers. This pregnancy rate is much higher than that of their native Myanmar where only 4.7% of women are pregnant or new mothers.<ref name=\":10\" /> Many experts believe that the increase in pregnancy rate is a result of sexual violence against displaced Rohingya women. The Bangladesh home ministry states that a staggering 90% of female refugees have been victims of rape.<ref name=\":10\" /> Many victims of rape at the hands of soldiers are killed because of their race. Gender inequalities and marginalization of women are additional reasons for the high rates of violence against women.\n\n[[Child marriage]] is a common practice among the Rohingya.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last=Ainul|first=Sigma|last2=Ehsan|first2=Iqbal|last3=Haque|first3=Eashita F.|last4=Amin|first4=Sajeda|last5=Rob|first5=Ubaidur|last6=Melnikas|first6=Andrea J.|last7=Falcone|first7=Joseph|date=2018|title=Marriage and Sexual and Reproductive Health of Rohingya Adolescents and Youth in Bangladesh: A Qualitative Study|url=|journal=Population Council|publisher=UNFPA|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> There is also a lack of legal procedures for marriage in the Camps that refugees are placed in. Very often marriages are based on dowries and arranged marriages tend to happen early for girls within the camps, due to fear of sexual violence. When women are married, they are told that they should have a large family as it is a sin for a woman to limit the number of children she bears.<ref name=\":11\" /> Contraception methods are very limited and may believe it may lead to infertility or death; family planning is also seen as immoral.<ref name=\":11\" /> Although there are reproductive health services within the camps, not many people seek reproductive care due to a lack of trust in medical personnel and practices, as well as barriers to transportation. Women also tend to be less independently mobile within their communities compared to men. Women and girls usually receive information on sexual and reproductive health through elderly women within the population and although this can be helpful, very often false information is given to people about reproductive health.<ref name=\":11\" /> Having limited participation with the clinics has to lead to increases in unsafe pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nMost of the Rohingya refugees deliver infants with the help of midwives.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/news/sexual-and-reproductive-health-needs-immense-among-rohingya-refugees|title=Sexual and reproductive health needs immense among Rohingya refugees|date=2018|website=www.unfpa.org|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|language=en}}</ref> The United Nations Population Fund ([[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]) has been responsible for ensuring that the midwifery diploma program is in the refugee camps.<ref name=\":12\" /> An increase in violence among refugees has been documented and as a result, the midwives are sometimes unable to provide the proper access to healthcare and resources. Many of the midwives in the region also can not give the best sexual health resources because of language barriers and cultural differences.<ref name=\":12\" /> Due to the Rohingya's conservative values, sexual and reproductive health information and care is limited and midwives are limited in the information they can provide. The majority of expectant women tend to be between the ages of 15 to 18 years old. Currently, there are approximately 19 facilities within the refugee camps that help give access to reproductive healthcare, however, there is a growing need for services and support for reproductive health issues.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nAnother factor contributing to the health of Rohingya women is the ability to breastfeed infants and availability of spaces to do so. As of 2017, about 8.3% of the Rohingya population was breastfeeding.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wvi.org/myanmar-%E2%80%93-bangladesh-refugee-crisis/article/breastfeeding-boosts-baby-shamsidas-health-camp|title=Breastfeeding boosts baby Shamsida's health in the camp|last=Homer|first=K.|date=2018|website=WVI.org|publisher=World Vision International|language=en}}</ref> On average the Rohingya women will give birth to 3.8 children in their lifespan and will breastfeed for a total of 6.9 years.<ref name=\":13\" /> A large increase in childbearing has been seen and breastfeeding-safe regions are have become very limited and overcrowded for women as a result. As well as having limited space to participate in breastfeeding, many mothers are not given accurate information on proper feeding practices.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n==Education==\nAs of 2020, approximately one-third of refugee Rohingya children were able to access [[primary education]], primarily through temporary centers run by international organizations.

Ideally, different levels of care are to be provided to best serve communities, as well as individuals. The philosophy behind this model maintains that individual psychological treatment and broad social interventions are both essential to overall mental wellbeing and resilience. It also acknowledges that most of a population require minimal psychosocial interventions in order to improve or prevent adverse mental health outcomes, which can be facilitated by mental health workers. However, those who experience impaired functioning due to severe emotional distress, or who require pharmaceutical treatment for an existing or developing condition would require more specialized services facilitated my more highly trained professionals, such as psychiatrists and psychologists.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Rohingya refugees settled in the Cox's Bazar region of Bangladesh are at risk for mental health issues due to a wide variety of factors, including prior history of systematic dehumanization, persecution, having witnessed or experienced traumatic events, and daily stressors of remaining in a refugee settlement. The history of the Rohingya located in the Rakhine State of Myanmar includes protracted social and economic exclusion, which ultimately escalated to extreme violence resulting in a mass exodus of up to an estimated 900,000 refugees to date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.searo.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2018/1680/en/|title=World Health Organization, Urgent need to scale up health services in Cox's Bazar: WHO|website=SEARO|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref> The traumatic events that have occurred in Rakhine State included burning of villages, arrests, torture, sexual assault, and loss of family and livelihoods.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Riley|first=Andrew|last2=Varner|first2=Andrea|last3=Ventevogel|first3=Peter|last4=Taimur Hasan|first4=M.

Efforts since the beginning of the crisis have focused on providing basic psychosocial training and non-specialized community interventions, including training in Psychological First Aid. Integrating MHPSS interventions and awareness in primary healthcare services have also been problematic, as providing adequate access to basic health services itself has been a challenge in the refugee camps due to a shortage in supplies, space, and staff.<ref name=\":0\" /> This integration continues to be a goal and efforts towards program implementation and training of healthcare professionals in the field have been an area of focus. However, the increases in the camp population, especially during the rapid population influx of an estimated 700,000 in 2017, only exacerbated these challenges. Furthermore, the resource-poor humanitarian efforts are suggested to increase negative psychological impacts by perpetuating anxiety, stress and depression and decreasing capacity for resilience.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAccording to a report published by the United Nations Higher Commissioner for Refugees ([[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]]), there have been few studies published on mental health concerns of the Rohingya refugee populations. Nonetheless, there are a concerning number of cases reported involving \u201cexplosive anger, psychotic-like symptoms, somatic or medically unexplained symptoms, impaired function and suicidal ideation,\u201d along with a documented history of reported high anxiety, hypervigilance, depression, and appetite loss within the population.<ref name=\":0\" /> The factors suggested to cause such prominent mental health concerns involve not only daily stressors of refugee living situations and the immediate trauma endured prior to arrival, but also due to protracted traumatic or stressful experience being persecuted in Rakhine State before fleeing.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe combination of the protracted refugee crisis with a history of stress, persecution and trauma is a cause for concern with the Rohingya and further investigation into the effects and treatments has been recommended. Furthermore, there have been obstacles with reporting mental health measurement results, including not having validated such measurements with the Rohingyas prior to research, as well as a substandard understanding of cultural idioms of distress. This allows for possible misinterpretation of mental health concerns if viewed and diagnosed by Western standards and definitions alone. Further evaluation into cultural idioms of distress, validity of results and continued research has been recommended by multiple involved agencies.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Food- and water-borne diseases ===\n[[File:Rohingya displaced Muslims 011.jpg|thumb|255x255px|Clean water and sanitation are scarce for many Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, especially in unregistered camps.<ref name=\":15\" />]]\nPoor infrastructure and sanitation in refugee camps place the Rohingya at increased risk for food- and water-borne diseases.

Rohingya refugees are often not vaccinated and there is worry that outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as polio, measles, and tetanus, will occur if living conditions are not improved.<ref name=\":7\" /> But the UN and the WHO, along with Bangladesh Government, were quick to begin mass vaccination of the population. Measles outbreak is a dangerous threat and in 2017, the WHO announced that 136,000 children under 15 years of age were vaccinated against measles and rubella. An oral [[polio vaccine]] was also given to 72,000 children. Permanent vaccination centers are in place to assist in the vaccination effort of children under the age of 2 years. In October 2017, a mass vaccination effort spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and partners provided 900,000 doses of oral [[cholera vaccine]] in two phases. More than 700,000 people over 1 year of age received a single dose during the first phase; in the second, an additional dose of the oral cholera vaccine was administered to 199,472 children ages 1 to 5 years. In addition, 236,696 children under 5 years of age were also vaccinated against polio.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.searo.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2017/1671/en/ |title = World Health Organization, Bangladesh steps up vaccination for new Rohingya arrivals as measles cases rise}}</ref> No new cases of cholera were detected in the 3 months following mass vaccination.

In the refugee camps in Bangladesh, over 25% of Rohingya children are malnourished and over 12% are suffering from severe [[Stunted growth|stunting]], a condition resulting from starvation and malnutrition. Infants under 6 months are among the most vulnerable and have malnutrition rates near 50%.<ref name=\":6\" /> This is in part due to mothers lack of ability to provide breast milk due to their own lack of nutrition. Refugees are dependent on humanitarian aid and while efforts to combat malnutrition are underway, there is still an alarming rate of malnutrition.

Applications running on an [[end system]] (PC, smartphone etc.) across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. [[Encryption]] is a common, though not an inherent, part of a VPN connection.<ref>{{cite book |author= Mason, Andrew G. |title=Cisco Secure Virtual Private Network |url= https://archive.org/details/ciscosecurevirtu00andr |url-access= registration |publisher= Cisco Press |date= 2002 |page= [https://archive.org/details/ciscosecurevirtu00andr/page/7 7]}}</ref>\n\nVPN technology was developed to allow remote users and branch offices to access corporate applications and resources. To ensure security, the private network connection is established using an encrypted layered [[tunneling protocol]], and VPN users use authentication methods, including passwords or certificates, to gain access to the VPN. In other applications, Internet users may secure their connections with a VPN to circumvent [[Geo-blocking|geo-restrictions]] and [[censorship]] or to connect to [[proxy server]]s to protect personal identity and location to stay anonymous on the Internet. Some websites, however, block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions, and many VPN providers have been developing strategies to get around these roadblocks.\n\nA VPN is created by establishing a virtual [[point-to-point (network topology)|point-to-point]] connection through the use of dedicated circuits or with tunneling protocols over existing networks. A VPN available from the public Internet can provide some of the benefits of a [[wide area network]] (WAN). From a user perspective, the resources available within the private network can be accessed remotely.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[Microsoft Technet]] |title= Virtual Private Networking: An Overview |url= https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742566.aspx |date=September 4, 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:VPN classification-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|VPN classification based on the topology first, then on the technology used.]]\n[[File:Site-to-site VPN-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A typical site-to-site VPN.]]\nEarly data networks allowed VPN-style connections to remote sites through [[dial-up modem]] or through [[leased line]] connections utilizing [[X.25]], [[Frame Relay]] and [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) virtual circuits provided through networks owned and operated by [[Telephone company|telecommunication carriers]]. These networks are not considered true VPNs because they passively secure the data being transmitted by the creation of logical data streams.<ref>Cisco Systems, et al.

In a corporate setting, remote-access VPNs allow employees to access the company's [[intranet]] from outside the office. Site-to-site VPNs allow collaborators in geographically disparate offices to share the same virtual network. A VPN can also be used to interconnect two similar networks over a dissimilar intermediate network, such as two [[IPv6]] networks connected over an [[IPv4]] network.<ref>{{cite web|last=Technet Lab |title=IPv6 traffic over VPN connections |url=http://lab.technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc138002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615203602/http://lab.technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc138002 |archivedate=15 June 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nVPN systems may be classified by:\n* the tunneling protocol used to [[IP tunnel|tunnel]] the traffic\n* the tunnel's termination point location, e.g., on the customer [[Edge device|edge]] or network-provider edge\n* the type of topology of connections, such as site-to-site or network-to-network\n* the levels of security provided\n* the [[OSI model|OSI layer]] they present to the connecting network, such as Layer 2 circuits or Layer 3 network connectivity\n* the number of simultaneous connections\n\n==Security mechanisms==\nVPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security.

User-created remote-access VPNs may use [[passwords]], [[biometrics]], [[two-factor authentication]] or other [[cryptographic]] methods. Network-to-network tunnels often use passwords or [[digital certificates]]. They permanently store the key to allow the tunnel to establish automatically, without intervention from the administrator.\n\n==Routing==\nTunneling protocols can operate in a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] [[network topology]] that would theoretically not be considered a VPN because a VPN by definition is expected to support arbitrary and changing sets of network nodes. But since most [[Router (computing)|router]] implementations support a software-defined tunnel interface, customer-provisioned VPNs often are simply defined tunnels running conventional routing protocols.\n\n===Provider-provisioned VPN building-blocks===\n[[File:Site-to-Site VPN terminology-en.svg|thumb|300px|Site-to-Site VPN terminology.]]\nDepending on whether a provider-provisioned VPN (PPVPN) operates in layer 2 or layer 3, the building blocks described below may be L2 only, L3 only, or a combination of both.

C devices are not aware of the VPN.\n\n; Customer Edge device (CE)\nA device at the edge of the customer's network which provides access to the PPVPN. Sometimes it is just a demarcation point between provider and customer responsibility. Other providers allow customers to configure it.\n\n; Provider edge device (PE)\nA device, or set of devices, at the edge of the provider network which connects to customer networks through CE devices and presents the provider's view of the customer site. PEs are aware of the VPNs that connect through them, and maintain VPN state.\n\n; Provider device (P)\nA device that operates inside the provider's core network and does not directly interface to any customer endpoint. It might, for example, provide routing for many provider-operated tunnels that belong to different customers' PPVPNs. While the P device is a key part of implementing PPVPNs, it is not itself VPN-aware and does not maintain VPN state. Its principal role is allowing the service provider to scale its PPVPN offerings, for example, by acting as an aggregation point for multiple PEs. P-to-P connections, in such a role, often are high-capacity optical links between major locations of providers.\n\n==User-visible PPVPN services==\n===OSI Layer 2 services===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n;Virtual LAN\n[[Virtual LAN]] (VLAN) is a Layer 2 technique that allow for the coexistence of multiple [[local area network]] (LAN) broadcast domains interconnected via trunks using the [[IEEE 802.1Q]] trunking protocol. Other trunking protocols have been used but have become obsolete, including Inter-Switch Link (ISL), IEEE 802.10 (originally a security protocol but a subset was introduced for trunking), and ATM LAN Emulation (LANE).\n\n;Virtual private LAN service (VPLS)\nDeveloped by [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], [[Virtual LAN]]s (VLANs) allow multiple tagged LANs to share common trunking. VLANs frequently comprise only customer-owned facilities. Whereas VPLS as described in the above section (OSI Layer 1 services) supports emulation of both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint topologies, the method discussed here extends Layer 2 technologies such as [[802.1d]] and [[802.1q]] LAN trunking to run over transports such as [[Metro Ethernet]].\n\nAs used in this context, a [[VPLS]] is a Layer 2 PPVPN, emulating the full functionality of a traditional LAN. From a user standpoint, a VPLS makes it possible to interconnect several LAN segments over a packet-switched, or optical, provider core, a core transparent to the user, making the remote LAN segments behave as one single LAN.<ref>{{citation |url=http://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/howto-openvpn-as/214-how-to-setup-layer-2-ethernet-bridging.html |title=Ethernet Bridging (OpenVPN)}}</ref>\n\nIn a VPLS, the provider network emulates a learning bridge, which optionally may include VLAN service.\n\n;Pseudo wire (PW)\nPW is similar to VPLS, but it can provide different L2 protocols at both ends. Typically, its interface is a WAN protocol such as [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] or [[Frame Relay]]. In contrast, when aiming to provide the appearance of a LAN contiguous between two or more locations, the Virtual Private LAN service or IPLS would be appropriate.\n\n; Ethernet over IP tunneling\nEtherIP ({{IETF RFC|3378}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3378|title=EtherIP: Tunneling Ethernet Frames in IP Datagrams|first1=Scott|last1=Hollenbeck|first2=Russell|last2=Housley|publisher=}}</ref> is an Ethernet over IP tunneling protocol specification. EtherIP has only packet encapsulation mechanism. It has no confidentiality nor message integrity protection. EtherIP was introduced in the [[FreeBSD]] network stack<ref>Glyn M Burton: [https://securethoughts.com/9-rfc-3378-etherip-with-freebsd/ RFC 3378  EtherIP with FreeBSD], 03 February 2011</ref> and the [[SoftEther VPN]]<ref name=\"net-security.org\">net-security.org news: [http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=16171 Multi-protocol SoftEther VPN becomes open source], January 2014</ref> server program.\n\n;IP-only LAN-like service (IPLS)\nA subset of VPLS, the CE devices must have Layer 3 capabilities; the IPLS presents packets rather than frames. It may support IPv4 or IPv6.\n\n===OSI Layer 3 PPVPN architectures===\nThis section discusses the main architectures for PPVPNs, one where the PE disambiguates duplicate addresses in a single routing instance, and the other, virtual router, in which the PE contains a virtual router instance per VPN. The former approach, and its variants, have gained the most attention.\n\nOne of the challenges of PPVPNs involves different customers using the same address space, especially the IPv4 private address space.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt Address Allocation for Private Internets], {{IETF RFC|1918}}, Y. Rekhter ''et al.'', February 1996</ref> The provider must be able to disambiguate overlapping addresses in the multiple customers' PPVPNs.\n\n;BGP/MPLS PPVPN\nIn the method defined by {{IETF RFC|2547}}, BGP extensions advertise routes in the IPv4 VPN address family, which are of the form of 12-byte strings, beginning with an 8-byte [[route distinguisher]] (RD) and ending with a 4-byte IPv4 address. RDs disambiguate otherwise duplicate addresses in the same PE.\n\nPEs understand the topology of each VPN, which are interconnected with MPLS tunnels either directly or via P routers. In MPLS terminology, the P routers are [[Label Switch Router]]s without awareness of VPNs.\n\n;Virtual router PPVPN\nThe virtual router architecture,<ref>{{IETF RFC|2917}}, ''A Core MPLS IP VPN Architecture''</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|2918}}, E. Chen (September 2000)</ref> as opposed to BGP/MPLS techniques, requires no modification to existing routing protocols such as BGP. By the provisioning of logically independent routing domains, the customer operating a VPN is completely responsible for the address space. In the various MPLS tunnels, the different PPVPNs are disambiguated by their label but do not need routing distinguishers.\n\n===Unencrypted tunnels===\nSome virtual networks use tunneling protocols without encryption for protecting the privacy of data. While VPNs often do provide security, an unencrypted [[overlay network]] does not neatly fit within the secure or trusted categorization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Yanyan|date=2006|title=IPsec/VPN security policy correctness and assurance|journal=Journal of High Speed Networks|volume=15|pages=275\u2013289|citeseerx=10.1.1.94.8561}}</ref> For example, a tunnel set up between two hosts with [[Generic Routing Encapsulation]] (GRE) is a virtual private network but is neither secure nor trusted.<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview of Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPN) |url=https://securethoughts.com/overview-provider-provisioned-virtual-private-networks-ppvpn/ |publisher=Secure Thoughts |accessdate = 29 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|1702}}: Generic Routing Encapsulation over IPv4 networks.

Some use open-source firmware such as [[DD-WRT]], [[OpenWRT]] and [[Tomato (firmware)|Tomato]] in order to support additional protocols such as [[OpenVPN]].\n\nSetting up VPN services on a router requires a deep knowledge of network security and careful installation. Minor misconfiguration of VPN connections can leave the network vulnerable. Performance will vary depending on the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/answer/How-can-incorrectly-configuring-VPN-clients-lead-to-a-security-breach|title=How can incorrectly configuring VPN clients lead to a security breach?|work=SearchEnterpriseWAN|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Networking limitations==\nA limitation of traditional VPNs is that they are point-to-point connections and do not tend to support [[broadcast domain]]s; therefore, communication, software, and networking, which are based on [[OSI layer|layer 2]] and broadcast [[Network packet|packets]], such as [[NetBIOS]] used in [[My Network Places|Windows networking]], may not be fully supported as on a [[local area network]]. Variants on VPN such as [[Virtual Private LAN Service]] (VPLS) and layer 2 tunneling protocols are designed to overcome this limitation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Virtual Private Networking: An Overview |url= https://hackercombat.com/virtual-private-network/ |date=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial VPNs==\n{{see also|Comparison of virtual private network services}}\nA wide variety of commercial entities also sell \"VPNs\" for all kinds of purposes, but depending on the provider and the application, they may not create a true \"private network\" with anything meaningful on the local network. For example, a commercial VPN marketed for Internet access (censorship circumvention, anonymization, geo-unblocking) only needs to tunnel the user's internet traffic somewhere else securely and there is typically no way for a user's devices connected to the same \"VPN\" to see each other. These VPNs can be based on typical VPN protocols or more camouflaged VPN implementations like [[SoftEther VPN]], but proxy protocols like [[Shadowsocks]] are used as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hodge |first1=Rae |title=Proxy vs. VPN: If it's built into your browser, it might not be a true VPN |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/proxy-vs-vpn-if-its-built-into-your-browser-its-actually-not-a-true-vpn/ |website=CNET |accessdate=21 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Commercial VPNs are usually marketed as privacy protection software that offers additional encryption services.\n\nOn the client side, a commercial VPN setup, even those not using a conventional VPN protocol, typically use the operating system's VPN interfaces to capture a user's data to send through. This include virtual network adapters on computer OSes and specialized \"VPN\" interfaces on mobile operating systems. A less common alternative is to provide a [[SOCKS]] proxy interface.\n\n{{anchor|Public or private VPNs}}\nUsers must consider that when the transmitted content is not encrypted ''before'' entering a VPN, that data is visible at the receiving endpoint (usually the public VPN provider's site) regardless of whether the VPN tunnel ''wrapper'' itself is encrypted for the inter-node transport. The ''only'' secure VPN is where the participants have oversight at ''both'' ends of the entire data path, or the content is encrypted before it enters the tunnel provider.\n\n==Legality==\n{{see|VPN blocking}}\nUnapproved VPNs are reportedly illegal in China, as they can be used to circumvent the [[Great Firewall]].

Applications running on an [[end system]] (PC, smartphone etc.) across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. [[Encryption]] is a common, though not an inherent, part of a VPN connection.<ref>{{cite book |author= Mason, Andrew G. |title=Cisco Secure Virtual Private Network |url= https://archive.org/details/ciscosecurevirtu00andr |url-access= registration |publisher= Cisco Press |date= 2002 |page= [https://archive.org/details/ciscosecurevirtu00andr/page/7 7]}}</ref>\n\nVPN technology was developed to allow remote users and branch offices to access corporate applications and resources. To ensure security, the private network connection is established using an encrypted layered [[tunneling protocol]], and VPN users use authentication methods, including passwords or certificates, to gain access to the VPN. In other applications, Internet users may secure their connections with a VPN to circumvent [[Geo-blocking|geo-restrictions]] and [[censorship]] or to connect to [[proxy server]]s to protect personal identity and location to stay anonymous on the Internet. Some websites, however, block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions, and many VPN providers have been developing strategies to get around these roadblocks.\n\nA VPN is created by establishing a virtual [[point-to-point (network topology)|point-to-point]] connection through the use of dedicated circuits or with tunneling protocols over existing networks. A VPN available from the public Internet can provide some of the benefits of a [[wide area network]] (WAN). From a user perspective, the resources available within the private network can be accessed remotely.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[Microsoft Technet]] |title= Virtual Private Networking: An Overview |url= https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742566.aspx |date=September 4, 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:VPN classification-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|VPN classification based on the topology first, then on the technology used.]]\n[[File:Site-to-site VPN-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A typical site-to-site VPN.]]\nEarly data networks allowed VPN-style connections to remote sites through [[dial-up modem]] or through [[leased line]] connections utilizing [[X.25]], [[Frame Relay]] and [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) virtual circuits provided through networks owned and operated by [[Telephone company|telecommunication carriers]]. These networks are not considered true VPNs because they passively secure the data being transmitted by the creation of logical data streams.<ref>Cisco Systems, et al. ''Internet working Technologies Handbook, Third Edition''.

In a corporate setting, remote-access VPNs allow employees to access the company's [[intranet]] from outside the office. Site-to-site VPNs allow collaborators in geographically disparate offices to share the same virtual network. A VPN can also be used to interconnect two similar networks over a dissimilar intermediate network, such as two [[IPv6]] networks connected over an [[IPv4]] network.<ref>{{cite web|last=Technet Lab |title=IPv6 traffic over VPN connections |url=http://lab.technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc138002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615203602/http://lab.technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc138002 |archivedate=15 June 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nVPN systems may be classified by:\n* the tunneling protocol used to [[IP tunnel|tunnel]] the traffic\n* the tunnel's termination point location, e.g., on the customer [[Edge device|edge]] or network-provider edge\n* the type of topology of connections, such as site-to-site or network-to-network\n* the levels of security provided\n* the [[OSI model|OSI layer]] they present to the connecting network, such as Layer 2 circuits or Layer 3 network connectivity\n* the number of simultaneous connections\n\n==Security mechanisms==\nVPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security.

User-created remote-access VPNs may use [[passwords]], [[biometrics]], [[two-factor authentication]] or other [[cryptographic]] methods. Network-to-network tunnels often use passwords or [[digital certificates]]. They permanently store the key to allow the tunnel to establish automatically, without intervention from the administrator.\n\n==Routing==\nTunneling protocols can operate in a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] [[network topology]] that would theoretically not be considered a VPN because a VPN by definition is expected to support arbitrary and changing sets of network nodes. But since most [[Router (computing)|router]] implementations support a software-defined tunnel interface, customer-provisioned VPNs often are simply defined tunnels running conventional routing protocols.\n\n===Provider-provisioned VPN building-blocks===\n[[File:Site-to-Site VPN terminology-en.svg|thumb|300px|Site-to-Site VPN terminology.]]\nDepending on whether a provider-provisioned VPN (PPVPN) operates in layer 2 or layer 3, the building blocks described below may be L2 only, L3 only, or a combination of both.

C devices are not aware of the VPN.\n\n; Customer Edge device (CE)\nA device at the edge of the customer's network which provides access to the PPVPN. Sometimes it is just a demarcation point between provider and customer responsibility. Other providers allow customers to configure it.\n\n; Provider edge device (PE)\nA device, or set of devices, at the edge of the provider network which connects to customer networks through CE devices and presents the provider's view of the customer site. PEs are aware of the VPNs that connect through them, and maintain VPN state.\n\n; Provider device (P)\nA device that operates inside the provider's core network and does not directly interface to any customer endpoint. It might, for example, provide routing for many provider-operated tunnels that belong to different customers' PPVPNs. While the P device is a key part of implementing PPVPNs, it is not itself VPN-aware and does not maintain VPN state. Its principal role is allowing the service provider to scale its PPVPN offerings, for example, by acting as an aggregation point for multiple PEs. P-to-P connections, in such a role, often are high-capacity optical links between major locations of providers.\n\n==User-visible PPVPN services==\n===OSI Layer 2 services===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n;Virtual LAN\n[[Virtual LAN]] (VLAN) is a Layer 2 technique that allow for the coexistence of multiple [[local area network]] (LAN) broadcast domains interconnected via trunks using the [[IEEE 802.1Q]] trunking protocol. Other trunking protocols have been used but have become obsolete, including Inter-Switch Link (ISL), IEEE 802.10 (originally a security protocol but a subset was introduced for trunking), and ATM LAN Emulation (LANE).\n\n;Virtual private LAN service (VPLS)\nDeveloped by [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], [[Virtual LAN]]s (VLANs) allow multiple tagged LANs to share common trunking. VLANs frequently comprise only customer-owned facilities. Whereas VPLS as described in the above section (OSI Layer 1 services) supports emulation of both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint topologies, the method discussed here extends Layer 2 technologies such as [[802.1d]] and [[802.1q]] LAN trunking to run over transports such as [[Metro Ethernet]].\n\nAs used in this context, a [[VPLS]] is a Layer 2 PPVPN, emulating the full functionality of a traditional LAN. From a user standpoint, a VPLS makes it possible to interconnect several LAN segments over a packet-switched, or optical, provider core, a core transparent to the user, making the remote LAN segments behave as one single LAN.<ref>{{citation |url=http://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/howto-openvpn-as/214-how-to-setup-layer-2-ethernet-bridging.html |title=Ethernet Bridging (OpenVPN)}}</ref>\n\nIn a VPLS, the provider network emulates a learning bridge, which optionally may include VLAN service.\n\n;Pseudo wire (PW)\nPW is similar to VPLS, but it can provide different L2 protocols at both ends. Typically, its interface is a WAN protocol such as [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] or [[Frame Relay]]. In contrast, when aiming to provide the appearance of a LAN contiguous between two or more locations, the Virtual Private LAN service or IPLS would be appropriate.\n\n; Ethernet over IP tunneling\nEtherIP ({{IETF RFC|3378}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3378|title=EtherIP: Tunneling Ethernet Frames in IP Datagrams|first1=Scott|last1=Hollenbeck|first2=Russell|last2=Housley|publisher=}}</ref> is an Ethernet over IP tunneling protocol specification. EtherIP has only packet encapsulation mechanism. It has no confidentiality nor message integrity protection. EtherIP was introduced in the [[FreeBSD]] network stack<ref>Glyn M Burton: [https://securethoughts.com/9-rfc-3378-etherip-with-freebsd/ RFC 3378  EtherIP with FreeBSD], 03 February 2011</ref> and the [[SoftEther VPN]]<ref name=\"net-security.org\">net-security.org news: [http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=16171 Multi-protocol SoftEther VPN becomes open source], January 2014</ref> server program.\n\n;IP-only LAN-like service (IPLS)\nA subset of VPLS, the CE devices must have Layer 3 capabilities; the IPLS presents packets rather than frames. It may support IPv4 or IPv6.\n\n===OSI Layer 3 PPVPN architectures===\nThis section discusses the main architectures for PPVPNs, one where the PE disambiguates duplicate addresses in a single routing instance, and the other, virtual router, in which the PE contains a virtual router instance per VPN. The former approach, and its variants, have gained the most attention.\n\nOne of the challenges of PPVPNs involves different customers using the same address space, especially the IPv4 private address space.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt Address Allocation for Private Internets], {{IETF RFC|1918}}, Y. Rekhter ''et al.'', February 1996</ref> The provider must be able to disambiguate overlapping addresses in the multiple customers' PPVPNs.\n\n;BGP/MPLS PPVPN\nIn the method defined by {{IETF RFC|2547}}, BGP extensions advertise routes in the IPv4 VPN address family, which are of the form of 12-byte strings, beginning with an 8-byte [[route distinguisher]] (RD) and ending with a 4-byte IPv4 address. RDs disambiguate otherwise duplicate addresses in the same PE.\n\nPEs understand the topology of each VPN, which are interconnected with MPLS tunnels either directly or via P routers. In MPLS terminology, the P routers are [[Label Switch Router]]s without awareness of VPNs.\n\n;Virtual router PPVPN\nThe virtual router architecture,<ref>{{IETF RFC|2917}}, ''A Core MPLS IP VPN Architecture''</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|2918}}, E. Chen (September 2000)</ref> as opposed to BGP/MPLS techniques, requires no modification to existing routing protocols such as BGP. By the provisioning of logically independent routing domains, the customer operating a VPN is completely responsible for the address space. In the various MPLS tunnels, the different PPVPNs are disambiguated by their label but do not need routing distinguishers.\n\n===Unencrypted tunnels===\nSome virtual networks use tunneling protocols without encryption for protecting the privacy of data. While VPNs often do provide security, an unencrypted [[overlay network]] does not neatly fit within the secure or trusted categorization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Yanyan|date=2006|title=IPsec/VPN security policy correctness and assurance|journal=Journal of High Speed Networks|volume=15|pages=275\u2013289|citeseerx=10.1.1.94.8561}}</ref> For example, a tunnel set up between two hosts with [[Generic Routing Encapsulation]] (GRE) is a virtual private network but is neither secure nor trusted.<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview of Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPN) |url=https://securethoughts.com/overview-provider-provisioned-virtual-private-networks-ppvpn/ |publisher=Secure Thoughts |accessdate = 29 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|1702}}: Generic Routing Encapsulation over IPv4 networks.

Supported devices are not restricted to those capable of running a VPN client.<ref name=draytek>{{cite web |title=VPN |website=Draytek |date= |url=http://www.draytek.co.uk/information/our-technology/vpn-overview |author= |accessdate= 19 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany router manufacturers supply routers with built-in VPN clients. Some use open-source firmware such as [[DD-WRT]], [[OpenWRT]] and [[Tomato (firmware)|Tomato]] in order to support additional protocols such as [[OpenVPN]].\n\nSetting up VPN services on a router requires a deep knowledge of network security and careful installation. Minor misconfiguration of VPN connections can leave the network vulnerable. Performance will vary depending on the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/answer/How-can-incorrectly-configuring-VPN-clients-lead-to-a-security-breach|title=How can incorrectly configuring VPN clients lead to a security breach?|work=SearchEnterpriseWAN|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Networking limitations==\nA limitation of traditional VPNs is that they are point-to-point connections and do not tend to support [[broadcast domain]]s; therefore, communication, software, and networking, which are based on [[OSI layer|layer 2]] and broadcast [[Network packet|packets]], such as [[NetBIOS]] used in [[My Network Places|Windows networking]], may not be fully supported as on a [[local area network]]. Variants on VPN such as [[Virtual Private LAN Service]] (VPLS) and layer 2 tunneling protocols are designed to overcome this limitation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Virtual Private Networking: An Overview |url= https://hackercombat.com/virtual-private-network/ |date=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial VPNs==\n{{see also|Comparison of virtual private network services}}\nA wide variety of commercial entities also sell \"VPNs\" for all kinds of purposes, but depending on the provider and the application, they may not create a true \"private network\" with anything meaningful on the local network. For example, a commercial VPN marketed for Internet access (censorship circumvention, anonymization, geo-unblocking) only needs to tunnel the user's internet traffic somewhere else securely and there is typically no way for a user's devices connected to the same \"VPN\" to see each other. These VPNs can be based on typical VPN protocols or more camouflaged VPN implementations like [[SoftEther VPN]], but proxy protocols like [[Shadowsocks]] are used as well.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hodge |first1=Rae |title=Proxy vs. VPN: If it's built into your browser, it might not be a true VPN |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/proxy-vs-vpn-if-its-built-into-your-browser-its-actually-not-a-true-vpn/ |website=CNET |accessdate=21 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Commercial VPNs are usually marketed as privacy protection software that offers additional encryption services.\n\nOn the client side, a commercial VPN setup, even those not using a conventional VPN protocol, typically use the operating system's VPN interfaces to capture a user's data to send through. This include virtual network adapters on computer OSes and specialized \"VPN\" interfaces on mobile operating systems. A less common alternative is to provide a [[SOCKS]] proxy interface.\n\n{{anchor|Public or private VPNs}}\nUsers must consider that when the transmitted content is not encrypted ''before'' entering a VPN, that data is visible at the receiving endpoint (usually the public VPN provider's site) regardless of whether the VPN tunnel ''wrapper'' itself is encrypted for the inter-node transport. The ''only'' secure VPN is where the participants have oversight at ''both'' ends of the entire data path, or the content is encrypted before it enters the tunnel provider.\n\n==Legality==\n{{see|VPN blocking}}\nUnapproved VPNs are reportedly illegal in China, as they can be used to circumvent the [[Great Firewall]]. (VPN refers to any protocol that tunnels traffic out elsewhere, as above.)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-vpns/businesses-consumers-uncertain-ahead-of-china-vpn-ban-idUSKBN1H612F|title=Businesses, consumers uncertain ahead of China VPN ban|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anonymizer]]\n* [[Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network]]\n* [[Internet privacy]]\n* [[Mediated VPN]]\n* [[Opportunistic encryption]]\n* [[Split tunneling]]\n* [[Virtual private server]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |date=August 2001 |title=Necessity is the mother of VPN invention |journal=Communication News |pages=26\u201328 |issn=0010-3632 |url=http://www.comnews.com/cgi-bin/arttop.asp?Page=c0801necessity.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20011217153420/http://www.comnews.com/cgi-bin/arttop.asp?Page=c0801necessity.htm |archivedate=2001-12-17 |last=Kelly |first=Sean}}\n\n{{VPN}}\n{{Cryptographic software}}\n{{Internet censorship circumvention technologies}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Virtual Private Network}}\n[[Category:Network architecture]]\n[[Category:Computer network security]]\n[[Category:Internet privacy]]\n[[Category:Crypto-anarchism]]\n[[Category:Virtual private networks| ]]\n", "name_user": "41.115.63.179", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eLegality)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network"}

Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as \"Pogo the Clown\" or \"Patches the Clown\", clowning persona he devised. He was also active in his local community as a precinct captain and building contractor.\n\nIt is believed all of Gacy's known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Gacy would typically lure a victim to his home, dupe him into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of demonstrating a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]], then rape and torture his captive before killing him by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a [[garrote]]. Twenty-six victims were buried in the [[crawl space]] of his home, three others were buried elsewhere on his property, and the last four were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released after 18 months. He first murdered in 1972, and at least 29 subsequent victims were killed after his divorce from his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the disappearance of [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nThe conviction for 33 murders was the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States until that time. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. On death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]] he spent much of his time painting. He was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his father's approval, later recollecting that, no matter what he achieved, he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary.\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by other Jaycees, he was highly regarded for his fund-raising work. In 1967 he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings Gacy often provided fried chicken and insisted on being called \"Colonel\" (for [[Colonel Sanders]]).{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to a son in February 1966 and a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\"{{snd}}he had earned his father's approval, which he had long sought. When Gacy's parents visited in July 1966, his father apologized for the abuse he had inflicted during Gacy's childhood, and said: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nMany Jaycees in Waterloo were involved in [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use; Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly had sex with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} He opened a \"club\" in his basement where his employees to drank and played pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances; if rebuffed, Gacy would claim these advances were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n===Assault of Donald Voorhees===\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded Voorhees to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing him into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support.

He offered Butkovich a drink, then conned him into allowing his wrists to be cuffed behind his back. Gacy said he \"sat on the kid's chest for a while\" before he strangled him.

In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because Szyc needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\", and that he now wanted to be the same for himself.<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> He stated most of his victims were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Gacy dismissed his victims as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\", adding that he occasionally awoke to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}}\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\n[[File:Gacysmilemugshot.png|thumb|upright=0.7|Gacy's [[mug shot]], taken December 22.]]\nAfter being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he had known his arrest was inevitable since the previous evening, which he had spent on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes, the majority of whom he had buried in his crawl space.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} Some victims he referred to by name, but most names he claimed not to know or remember. He confessed he had buried the body of John Butkovich in his garage.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=188}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired to construct this device, and to initially restrain his victims by tricking them into handcuffs, by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

Asked whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall said he believed that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the law's expectations because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> During specific cross-examination relating to the torture, Rignall vomited and was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|upright=1|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

At the time of this attack, Gacy had been participating in a voluntary work program when Brisbon ran towards him and stabbed him once in the upper arm with a sharpened wire. A second death row inmate injured in the attack, William Jones, received a [[surface anatomy|superficial]] stab wound to the head.

Gacy's appeals related to issues such as the validity of the first search warrant granted to Des Plaines police on December 13, 1978, and his objection to his lawyers' insanity plea defense at his trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=344}} Gacy also contended that, although he held \"some knowledge\" of five of the murders (those of McCoy, Butkovich, Godzik, Szyc and Piest),{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}} the other 28 murders had been committed by employees who were in possession of keys to his house while he was away on business trips.\n\nIn mid-1984, the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] upheld Gacy's conviction and ordered that he be executed by lethal injection on November 14.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=351}} Gacy filed an appeal against this decision, which was denied by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on March 4, 1985. The following year, Gacy filed a further post-conviction petition, seeking a new trial. His then-defense lawyer, [[Richard Kling]], argued that Gacy had been provided with ineffective legal counsel at his 1980 trial.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims.

Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as \"Pogo the Clown\" or \"Patches the Clown\", clowning persona he devised. He was also active in his local community as a precinct captain and building contractor.\n\nIt is believed all of Gacy's known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Gacy would typically lure a victim to his home, dupe him into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of demonstrating a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]], then rape and torture his captive before killing him by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a [[garrote]]. Twenty-six victims were buried in the [[crawl space]] of his home, three others were buried elsewhere on his property, and the last four were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released after 18 months. He first murdered in 1972, and at least 29 subsequent victims were killed after his divorce from his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the disappearance of [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nThe conviction for 33 murders was the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States until that time. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. On death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]] he spent much of his time painting. He was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his father's approval, later recollecting that, no matter what he achieved, he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary.\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by other Jaycees, he was highly regarded for his fund-raising work. In 1967 he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings Gacy often provided fried chicken and insisted on being called \"Colonel\" (for [[Colonel Sanders]]).{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to a son in February 1966 and a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\"{{snd}}he had earned his father's approval, which he had long sought. When Gacy's parents visited in July 1966, his father apologized for the abuse he had inflicted during Gacy's childhood, and said: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nMany Jaycees in Waterloo were involved in [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use; Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly had sex with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} He opened a \"club\" in his basement where his employees to drank and played pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances; if rebuffed, Gacy would claim these advances were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n===Assault of Donald Voorhees===\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded Voorhees to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing him into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him.

Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face, and beat him. Schroeder agreed, and in early September, he lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace into the youth's eyes, then beat him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n===Conviction and imprisonment===\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction.]]\nOn November 7, 1968 Gacy pled guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to Voorhees, but not guilty to the charges related to other youths. Gacy said that Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, to be served at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} That same day, his wife petitioned for divorce,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting award of the couple's home and property, sole custody of their two children, and [[alimony]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied. In preparation for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}}\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] 1969, Gacy's father died from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} When told the news, Gacy collapsed to the floor sobbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} His request for supervised compassionate leave to attend the funeral was denied.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|page=92}}\n\n==Return to Chicago==\nGacy was granted parole with 12 months' probation on June 18, 1970, after serving 18 months of his 10-year sentence.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=277}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}}{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=63}}{{sfn|Linedecker|1986|p=47}} Two of the conditions of his probation were for Gacy to relocate to Chicago to live with his mother and to observe a 10:00&nbsp;p.m. [[curfew]],{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} with the Iowa Board of Parole receiving regular updates as to his progress.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}}\n\nUpon his release, Gacy told friend and fellow Jaycee Clarence Lane\u2014who picked him up from the prison upon release and had remained steadfast in his belief of Gacy's innocence\u2014that he would \"never go back to jail\" and that he intended to re-establish himself in Waterloo. However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} who claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the boy into sex. This complaint was dismissed when the boy failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were later [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth who claimed that Gacy had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=112}} These charges were dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===PDM Contractors===\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance').{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=65}} With the approval of his probation officer, he was allowed to work evenings to commit to his employment contracts while working as a cook during the day. The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}} \n\nBy 1975, PDM was expanding rapidly and Gacy was working up to 16 hours per day. In March 1977, he became a supervisor for PE Systems, a firm specializing in the remodeling of drugstores. Between PE Systems and PDM, Gacy worked on up to four projects at once and frequently traveled to other states.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=180}} By 1978, PDM's annual revenue was over $200,000.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=221}}\n====Employees====\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the employee in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} After returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard.

The two drank a bottle of wine, then watched a heterosexual [[stag film]] before Gacy wrestled Antonucci to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} One cuff was loose and Antonucci freed his arm while Gacy was out of the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a high school wrestler\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy at first threatened Antonucci, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci would remove the handcuffs. Antonucci agreed and Gacy left.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy told him: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs, you got them on me\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n=====Cram and Rossi=====\nOn July 26, 1976, Gacy employed 18-year-old David Cram. On August 21,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=168}} Cram moved into his house. The following day, Gacy conned Cram into donning handcuffs while Cram was drunk. Gacy swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then said he intended to rape him. Cram kicked Gacy in the face and freed himself from the handcuffs.

While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}}  He was murdered shortly after 10:00&nbsp;p.m. at Gacy's home. Gacy later stated that as he placed the tourniquet around Piest's neck, Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref> He also admitted to having received a phone call from a business acquaintance as Piest lay dying on his bedroom floor.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=231}}\n\n==Investigation==\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a [[missing person]] report on their son with the Des Plaines police.

Kozenczak|Joseph Kozenczak]] chose to investigate Gacy further.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 26-27</ref>\n\nKozenczak and two other Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them\u2014whom he believed to be Piest\u2014whether any remodeling materials were present in the rear of the store.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=19\u201321}} He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When questioned as to how soon he could come to the police station, he responded: \"You guys are very rude. Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items. These included a [[syringe]], several police badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]]. They also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]], a 39 inch long [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with two holes drilled into each end,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} several driver's licenses, a blue hooded parka and underwear too small to fit Gacy.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nIn the northwest bedroom, investigators found a [[Maine West High School]] ring. This item initially interested investigators as Piest had attended Maine West, but the ring was not his. It was a class of 1975 ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=87}} A photo receipt from Nisson Pharmacy was also recovered from a trash can.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nGacy's Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles were confiscated by the Des Plaines police, who assigned two two-man [[surveillance]] teams to monitor Gacy on a rotational twelve-hour basis as they continued their investigation into his background and potential involvement in Piest's disappearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Murder casebook number 84 {{ISBN|0-7485-1454-6}}, p. 1915</ref> These surveillance teams consisted of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=41}} The following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators both of Gregory Godzik's disappearance and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river the previous year.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=53}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details upon Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, chloroformed him, raped him and dumped him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because Szyc needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\", and that he now wanted to be the same for himself.<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> He stated most of his victims were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Gacy dismissed his victims as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\", adding that he occasionally awoke to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}}\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging.

Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Cram and Rossi both confessed that Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space.

Rossi pointed to the location of the remains of an unidentified victim known as \"Body 13\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} Rossi stated he had not dug any other trenches, but\u2014at Gacy's request\u2014had supervised other PDM employees digging trenches in the crawl space.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nBoth Rossi and Cram also testified that Gacy periodically looked into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees ordered to dig trenches in the crawl space did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=312}} Gacy had testified after his arrest that he had only dug five of the victims' graves in his crawl space{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=142}} and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=360}}\n\nOn February 18 Robert Stein,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=321}} the Cook County medical examiner who supervised the exhumations, testified that all the bodies were \"markedly decomposed<!--,--> [and] putrefied<!--, skeletalized remains-->\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Mother Cries at Description of Son's Grave|date=February 19, 1980 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VHVkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Mn4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2366,5212913 |newspaper=The Calgary Herald |accessdate=October 24, 2018}}</ref> and that of all the autopsies he performed, thirteen victims had died of asphyxiation, six of ligature strangulation, one of multiple stab wounds to the chest,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=102}} and ten in undetermined ways.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=322}}{{efn|Stein performed autopsies on each victim recovered at Gacy's property and upon the body of Robert Piest.

Asked whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall said he believed that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the law's expectations because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> During specific cross-examination relating to the torture, Rignall vomited and was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|upright=1|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed.

Previously, the Sultan and his family had lived at the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]], but as the medieval Topkap\u0131 was lacking in contemporary style, luxury, and comfort, as compared to the palaces of the European monarchs, Abd\u00fclmecid decided to build a new modern palace near the site of the former Be\u015fikta\u015f Sahil Palace, which was demolished. Hac\u0131 Said A\u011fa was responsible for the construction works, while the project was realized by architects [[Garabet Balyan]], his son [[Nigo\u011fayos Balyan]] and Evanis Kalfa (members of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Balyan family]] of Ottoman court architects).\n\nThe construction cost five million [[Ottoman lira|Ottoman gold lira]], or 35 [[tonne]]s of [[gold]], the equivalent of ca. $1.5 billion in today's (2013) values.<ref>[http://www.dolmabahcepalace.com/listingview.php?listingID=3&name=Dolmabahce+Palace Dolmabahce Palace]</ref><ref>[http://www.goldgrambars.com/ Goldgrambars.com]</ref> This sum corresponded to approximately a quarter of the yearly tax revenue. Actually, the construction was financed through [[debasement]], by massive issue of paper money, as well as by foreign loans. The huge expenses placed an enormous burden on the state purse and contributed to the deteriorating financial situation of the Ottoman Empire, which eventually [[sovereign default|defaulted]] on its [[Ottoman public debt|public debt]] in [[Great Eastern Crisis#Background|October 1875]], with the subsequent establishment in 1881 of [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|financial control]] over the \"[[sick man of Europe]]\" by the European powers.\n\nThe palace was home to six Sultans from 1856, when it was first inhabited, up until the abolition of the Caliphate in 1924: The last royal to live here was Caliph [[Abd\u00fclmecid II|Abd\u00fclmecid Efendi]]. A law that went into effect on March 3, 1924 transferred the ownership of the palace to the national heritage of the new Turkish Republic. [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey, used the palace as a presidential residence during the summers and enacted some of his most important works here. Atat\u00fcrk spent the last days of his medical treatment in this palace, where he died on November 10, 1938.\n\nToday, the palace is managed by ''Milli Saraylar Daire Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131'' (Directorate of National Palaces) responsible to the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]].{{clear}}\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Dolmabahce Palacemm.jpg|thumb|Close-up view of the palace from the Bosphorus]]\nThe site of Dolmabah\u00e7e was originally a bay on the [[Bosphorus]] which was used for the anchorage of the Ottoman fleet. The area was reclaimed gradually during the 18th century to become an imperial garden, much appreciated by the Ottoman [[sultan]]s; it is from this garden that the name ''Dolmabah\u00e7e'' (Filled-in Garden) comes from the Turkish ''dolma'' meaning \"filled\" and ''bah\u00e7e'' meaning \"garden.\" Various small summer palaces and wooden pavilions were built here during the 18th and 19th centuries ultimately forming a palace complex named Be\u015fikta\u015f Waterfront Palace. The area of 110,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is confined by Bosphorus on the east side, while a steep precipice bounds it on the west side, such that after the building of the new 45,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 monoblock Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace a relatively limited space has remained for a garden complex which would normally surround such a palace.<ref name=IstanbulNet>[http://www.istanbul.net.tr/istanbul_muzeler_detay.asp?id=103 Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717084800/http://www.istanbul.net.tr/istanbul_muzeler_detay.asp?id=103 |date=July 17, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=CultureTourism>[http://www.turizm.gov.tr/EN,113763/dolmabahce-palace.html Turkish Ministry of Tourism site about Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]</ref>{{clear}}\n\n== Design and layout ==\n[[File:Dolmabahce Sarayi.jpg|thumb|left|Fountain in the garden]]\n[[File:Dolmabahce Palace plan.svg|thumb|Floor plan of the palace]]\nDolmabah\u00e7e is the largest palace in Turkey. It has an area of {{Convert|45,000|m2|acres|1|abbr = on}}, and contains 285 rooms, 46 halls, 6 baths (''[[Turkish bath|hamam]]'') and 68 toilets.<ref name=IstanbulNet/><ref name=CultureTourism/>\n\nThe design contains [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] elements from the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] styles, blended with traditional [[Ottoman architecture]] to create a new synthesis. The palace layout and d\u00e9cor reflect the increasing influence of European styles and standards on [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman culture and art]] during the [[Tanzimat]] period. The exterior, in particular the view from the Bosporus, shows a classical European two-wing arrangement which is divided by a big [[avant-corps]] with two side avant-corps.\n\nFunctionally, on the other hand, the palace retains elements of traditional Ottoman palace life, and also features of traditional Turkish homes. It is strictly separated structurally in a southern wing (''Mabeyn-i H\u00fcm\u00e2y\u00fbn'', or ''Selaml\u0131k'', the quarters reserved for the men) which contains the public representation rooms, and a northern wing (''Harem-i H\u00fcm\u00e2y\u00fbn'', the [[Imperial Harem|Harem]]) serving as the private residential area for the Sultan and his family. The two functional areas are separated by the big Ceremonial Hall (''Muayede Salonu'') with a floor area of {{Convert|2000|m2|ft2|abbr = on}} and a {{Convert|36|m|ft|abbr = on}} high dome. Since the harem had to be completely isolated from the outside world, the main entrance for the visitors is located on the narrow southern side. There, the representation rooms are arranged for receptions of visitors and of foreign diplomats. The harem area includes eight interconnected apartments for the wives of the sultan, for his favourites and concubines, and for his mother, each with its own bathroom.{{clear}}\n\n== D\u00e9cor and equipment ==\n\n[[File:Ceremonial hall Dolmabahce March 2008 pano4.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremonial Hall, with the chandelier said to have been given by [[Queen Victoria]]]]\n[[File:Dolmabahce Baccarat bannister.JPG|thumb|''Crystal Staircase'' with [[Baccarat crystal]] [[Baluster|banisters]] and chandelier]]\n[[File:Ambassador Hall Dolmabahce March 2008panoc.jpg|thumb|left|Ambassador's Hall (''S\u00fcfera Salonu'') with two bearskin rugs]]\n[[File:Istanbul img 5058.jpg|thumb|Sultan's hamam decorated with Egyptian alabaster]]\nWhereas the Topkap\u0131 has exquisite examples of [[Iznik tiles]] and Ottoman carving, the Dolmabah\u00e7e palace is extensively decorated with gold and crystal. Fourteen tonnes of gold were used to gild the ceilings.<ref>[http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&lng=3&id=107341 Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace], Emporis</ref> The world's largest [[Bohemian glass|Bohemian crystal]] [[chandelier]] is in the Ceremonial Hall. The chandelier was assumed to be a gift from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], however in 2006 the receipt was found showing it was paid for in full. It has 750 lamps and weighs 4.5 tonnes. Dolmabah\u00e7e has the largest collection of Bohemian and [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] chandeliers in the world. The famous ''Crystal Staircase'' has the shape of a double [[horseshoe]] and is built of Baccarat crystal, [[brass]] and [[mahogany]].\n\nExpensive stones such as [[Marmara Island|Marmara]] (Proconnesian) marble, Egyptian [[alabaster]] ([[calcite]], also known as onyx-marble), and [[Porphyry (geology)|Porphyry]] from [[Pergamon]] were used for the decoration.\n\nThe palace includes a large number of [[Hereke carpet|Hereke palace carpet]]s made by the Hereke Imperial Factory. Also featured are 150-year-old bearskin rugs originally presented to the Sultan as a gift by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]].\n\nA collection of 202 oil paintings is on display in the palace. A highlight of the collection are 23 paintings by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] which he created as a court painter during his stays in Istanbul.<ref name=Aivazovsky>[http://euroasianews.com/historical-ottoman-palace-to-reopen-as-a-museum/ Historical Ottoman Palace reopens as museum], EuroAsiaNews.com, March 22, 2014</ref> The collection also includes paintings by [[Gustave Boulanger]], [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Fromentin]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Chlebowski]], [[F\u00e9lix Ziem]], [[Karl Joseph Kuwasseg]], [[Fausto Zonaro]], [[Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe]] and Alexander Sandor Svoboda. There are also paintings by Turkish painters such as [[Osman Hamdi Bey]], [[Halil Pasha (painter)|Halil Pasha]] and [[Osman Nuri Pasha (painter)|Osman Nuri Pasha]] in this art museum.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the palace's equipment implemented the highest technical standards. [[Gas lighting]] and [[water-closet]]s were imported from Great Britain, whereas the palaces in continental Europe were still lacking these features at that time. Later, electricity, a [[central heating system]] and an [[elevator]] were installed.{{clear}}\n\n== Rooms ==\n\n[[File:Dolmabahce Palace ced.jpg|thumb|Blue Hall]]\n[[File:Dolmabahce Palacasdfe.jpg|thumb|Pink Hall]]\n\n=== Medhal (Main Entrance) Hall ===\n\nA visit to the Dolmabahce Palace begins at the Medhal Hall. Rooms leading off the Medhal are towards the sea and the land. The rooms facing the sea were used by the leading [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] officials, the [[Grand Vizier]] and the other state ministers, while the rooms facing the land were used by various administrators of the palace and the state, such as the Palace Marshall, [[Sheikh ul-Islam|\u015eeyh\u00fclislam]], and members of the House of Representatives (''Meclis-i Mebusan'') and the Senate (''Meclis-i Ayan'').\n\nGuests would first wait in this hall and then would be led inside at the proper time by a palace protocol officer. On entering the Medhal, one sees Boulle tables on both sides of the room, which bear the [[tughra|monogram]] of Sultan Abd\u00fclmecid on top. The royal monogram of the sultan is also on the fireplace. The English chandelier hanging in the middle of this room has sixty arms. The Hereke fabrics used as upholstery for the furniture and as draperies are in the royal shade of red.\n\n=== The secretariat's rooms ===\n\nThe second room after the Medhal to the right is the Clerk's Hall, also referred to as the ''Tiled Room.'' The largest painting in the palace collection, a depiction of the Surre Procession by [[Stefano Ussi]], hangs on the left wall of this hall. Surre was used to refer to the caravans which travelled from Istanbul to Mecca during the religious month of Recep, bearing the monetary aid used to support the maintenance and the decoration of the [[Kaaba]] and to provide financial assistance to the local population of [[Hejaz]].\n\n[[File:Ataturk deathbed Dolmabahce March 2008.JPG|thumb|[[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Atat\u00fcrk]]'s deathbed]]\n\nOn the wall to the right is a painting signed by [[Rudolf Ernst]] depicting the fire at the Paris Municipal Theater and another painting of a Dutch Village Girl by [[Delandre]].

Previously, the Sultan and his family had lived at the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]], but as the medieval Topkap\u0131 was lacking in contemporary style, luxury, and comfort, as compared to the palaces of the European monarchs, Abd\u00fclmecid decided to build a new modern palace near the site of the former Be\u015fikta\u015f Sahil Palace, which was demolished. Hac\u0131 Said A\u011fa was responsible for the construction works, while the project was realized by architects [[Garabet Balyan]], his son [[Nigo\u011fayos Balyan]] and Evanis Kalfa (members of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Balyan family]] of Ottoman court architects).\n\nThe construction cost five million [[Ottoman lira|Ottoman gold lira]], or 35 [[tonne]]s of [[gold]], the equivalent of ca. $1.5 billion in today's (2013) values.<ref>[http://www.dolmabahcepalace.com/listingview.php?listingID=3&name=Dolmabahce+Palace Dolmabahce Palace]</ref><ref>[http://www.goldgrambars.com/ Goldgrambars.com]</ref> This sum corresponded to approximately a quarter of the yearly tax revenue. Actually, the construction was financed through [[debasement]], by massive issue of paper money, as well as by foreign loans. The huge expenses placed an enormous burden on the state purse and contributed to the deteriorating financial situation of the Ottoman Empire, which eventually [[sovereign default|defaulted]] on its [[Ottoman public debt|public debt]] in [[Great Eastern Crisis#Background|October 1875]], with the subsequent establishment in 1881 of [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|financial control]] over the \"[[sick man of Europe]]\" by the European powers.\n\nThe palace was home to six Sultans from 1856, when it was first inhabited, up until the abolition of the Caliphate in 1924: The last royal to live here was Caliph [[Abd\u00fclmecid II|Abd\u00fclmecid Efendi]]. A law that went into effect on March 3, 1924 transferred the ownership of the palace to the national heritage of the new Turkish Republic. [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey, used the palace as a presidential residence during the summers and enacted some of his most important works here. Atat\u00fcrk spent the last days of his medical treatment in this palace, where he died on November 10, 1938.\n\nToday, the palace is managed by ''Milli Saraylar Daire Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131'' (Directorate of National Palaces) responsible to the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]].{{clear}}\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Dolmabahce Palacemm.jpg|thumb|Close-up view of the palace from the Bosphorus]]\nThe site of Dolmabah\u00e7e was originally a bay on the [[Bosphorus]] which was used for the anchorage of the Ottoman fleet. The area was reclaimed gradually during the 18th century to become an imperial garden, much appreciated by the Ottoman [[sultan]]s; it is from this garden that the name ''Dolmabah\u00e7e'' (Filled-in Garden) comes from the Turkish ''dolma'' meaning \"filled\" and ''bah\u00e7e'' meaning \"garden.\" Various small summer palaces and wooden pavilions were built here during the 18th and 19th centuries ultimately forming a palace complex named Be\u015fikta\u015f Waterfront Palace. The area of 110,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is confined by Bosphorus on the east side, while a steep precipice bounds it on the west side, such that after the building of the new 45,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 monoblock Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace a relatively limited space has remained for a garden complex which would normally surround such a palace.<ref name=IstanbulNet>[http://www.istanbul.net.tr/istanbul_muzeler_detay.asp?id=103 Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717084800/http://www.istanbul.net.tr/istanbul_muzeler_detay.asp?id=103 |date=July 17, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=CultureTourism>[http://www.turizm.gov.tr/EN,113763/dolmabahce-palace.html Turkish Ministry of Tourism site about Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]</ref>{{clear}}\n\n== Design and layout ==\n[[File:Dolmabahce Sarayi.jpg|thumb|left|Fountain in the garden]]\n[[File:Dolmabahce Palace plan.svg|thumb|Floor plan of the palace]]\nDolmabah\u00e7e is the largest palace in Turkey. It has an area of {{Convert|45,000|m2|acres|1|abbr = on}}, and contains 285 rooms, 46 halls, 6 baths (''[[Turkish bath|hamam]]'') and 68 toilets.<ref name=IstanbulNet/><ref name=CultureTourism/>\n\nThe design contains [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] elements from the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] styles, blended with traditional [[Ottoman architecture]] to create a new synthesis. The palace layout and d\u00e9cor reflect the increasing influence of European styles and standards on [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman culture and art]] during the [[Tanzimat]] period. The exterior, in particular the view from the Bosporus, shows a classical European two-wing arrangement which is divided by a big [[avant-corps]] with two side avant-corps.\n\nFunctionally, on the other hand, the palace retains elements of traditional Ottoman palace life, and also features of traditional Turkish homes. It is strictly separated structurally in a southern wing (''Mabeyn-i H\u00fcm\u00e2y\u00fbn'', or ''Selaml\u0131k'', the quarters reserved for the men) which contains the public representation rooms, and a northern wing (''Harem-i H\u00fcm\u00e2y\u00fbn'', the [[Imperial Harem|Harem]]) serving as the private residential area for the Sultan and his family. The two functional areas are separated by the big Ceremonial Hall (''Muayede Salonu'') with a floor area of {{Convert|2000|m2|ft2|abbr = on}} and a {{Convert|36|m|ft|abbr = on}} high dome. Since the harem had to be completely isolated from the outside world, the main entrance for the visitors is located on the narrow southern side. There, the representation rooms are arranged for receptions of visitors and of foreign diplomats. The harem area includes eight interconnected apartments for the wives of the sultan, for his favourites and concubines, and for his mother, each with its own bathroom.{{clear}}\n\n== D\u00e9cor and equipment ==\n\n[[File:Ceremonial hall Dolmabahce March 2008 pano4.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremonial Hall, with the chandelier said to have been given by [[Queen Victoria]]]]\n[[File:Dolmabahce Baccarat bannister.JPG|thumb|''Crystal Staircase'' with [[Baccarat crystal]] [[Baluster|banisters]] and chandelier]]\n[[File:Ambassador Hall Dolmabahce March 2008panoc.jpg|thumb|left|Ambassador's Hall (''S\u00fcfera Salonu'') with two bearskin rugs]]\n[[File:Istanbul img 5058.jpg|thumb|Sultan's hamam decorated with Egyptian alabaster]]\nWhereas the Topkap\u0131 has exquisite examples of [[Iznik tiles]] and Ottoman carving, the Dolmabah\u00e7e palace is extensively decorated with gold and crystal. Fourteen tonnes of gold were used to gild the ceilings.<ref>[http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&lng=3&id=107341 Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace], Emporis</ref> The world's largest [[Bohemian glass|Bohemian crystal]] [[chandelier]] is in the Ceremonial Hall. The chandelier was assumed to be a gift from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], however in 2006 the receipt was found showing it was paid for in full. It has 750 lamps and weighs 4.5 tonnes. Dolmabah\u00e7e has the largest collection of Bohemian and [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] chandeliers in the world. The famous ''Crystal Staircase'' has the shape of a double [[horseshoe]] and is built of Baccarat crystal, [[brass]] and [[mahogany]].\n\nExpensive stones such as [[Marmara Island|Marmara]] (Proconnesian) marble, Egyptian [[alabaster]] ([[calcite]], also known as onyx-marble), and [[Porphyry (geology)|Porphyry]] from [[Pergamon]] were used for the decoration.\n\nThe palace includes a large number of [[Hereke carpet|Hereke palace carpet]]s made by the Hereke Imperial Factory. Also featured are 150-year-old bearskin rugs originally presented to the Sultan as a gift by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]].\n\nA collection of 202 oil paintings is on display in the palace. A highlight of the collection are 23 paintings by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] which he created as a court painter during his stays in Istanbul.<ref name=Aivazovsky>[http://euroasianews.com/historical-ottoman-palace-to-reopen-as-a-museum/ Historical Ottoman Palace reopens as museum], EuroAsiaNews.com, March 22, 2014</ref> The collection also includes paintings by [[Gustave Boulanger]], [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Fromentin]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Chlebowski]], [[F\u00e9lix Ziem]], [[Karl Joseph Kuwasseg]], [[Fausto Zonaro]], [[Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe]] and Alexander Sandor Svoboda. There are also paintings by Turkish painters such as [[Osman Hamdi Bey]], [[Halil Pasha (painter)|Halil Pasha]] and [[Osman Nuri Pasha (painter)|Osman Nuri Pasha]] in this art museum.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the palace's equipment implemented the highest technical standards. [[Gas lighting]] and [[water-closet]]s were imported from Great Britain, whereas the palaces in continental Europe were still lacking these features at that time. Later, electricity, a [[central heating system]] and an [[elevator]] were installed.{{clear}}\n\n== Rooms ==\n\n[[File:Dolmabahce Palace ced.jpg|thumb|Blue Hall]]\n[[File:Dolmabahce Palacasdfe.jpg|thumb|Pink Hall]]\n\n=== Medhal (Main Entrance) Hall ===\n\nA visit to the Dolmabahce Palace begins at the Medhal Hall. Rooms leading off the Medhal are towards the sea and the land. The rooms facing the sea were used by the leading [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] officials, the [[Grand Vizier]] and the other state ministers, while the rooms facing the land were used by various administrators of the palace and the state, such as the Palace Marshall, [[Sheikh ul-Islam|\u015eeyh\u00fclislam]], and members of the House of Representatives (''Meclis-i Mebusan'') and the Senate (''Meclis-i Ayan'').\n\nGuests would first wait in this hall and then would be led inside at the proper time by a palace protocol officer. On entering the Medhal, one sees Boulle tables on both sides of the room, which bear the [[tughra|monogram]] of Sultan Abd\u00fclmecid on top. The royal monogram of the sultan is also on the fireplace. The English chandelier hanging in the middle of this room has sixty arms. The Hereke fabrics used as upholstery for the furniture and as draperies are in the royal shade of red.\n\n=== The secretariat's rooms ===\n\nThe second room after the Medhal to the right is the Clerk's Hall, also referred to as the ''Tiled Room.'' The largest painting in the palace collection, a depiction of the Surre Procession by [[Stefano Ussi]], hangs on the left wall of this hall. Surre was used to refer to the caravans which travelled from Istanbul to Mecca during the religious month of Recep, bearing the monetary aid used to support the maintenance and the decoration of the [[Kaaba]] and to provide financial assistance to the local population of [[Hejaz]].\n\n[[File:Ataturk deathbed Dolmabahce March 2008.JPG|thumb|[[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Atat\u00fcrk]]'s deathbed]]\n\nOn the wall to the right is a painting signed by [[Rudolf Ernst]] depicting the fire at the Paris Municipal Theater and another painting of a Dutch Village Girl by [[Delandre]].

Bluefields is Nicaragua\u2019s chief Caribbean [[port]], from which [[hardwood]], [[seafood]], [[shrimp]] and [[lobster]] are exported. Bluefields was a [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]] for English and Dutch [[buccaneer]]s in the 16th and 17th century and became capital of the [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[protectorate]] over the [[Mosquito Coast]] in 1678.\n\nDuring [[United States]] interventions (1912\u201315, 1926\u201333) in Nicaragua, [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] were stationed there. In 1984, the United States [[Land mine|mine]]d the harbor (along with those of [[Corinto, Nicaragua|Corinto]] and [[Puerto Sandino]]) as part of the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. Bluefields was destroyed by [[Hurricane Joan-Miriam|Hurricane Joan]] in 1988 but was rebuilt.\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the city of Bluefields is connected with the presence of [[Europe|European]] pirates on the [[Nicaragua|Nicaraguan]] Caribbean coast, subjects of powers at the time hostile to [[Spain]].  These pirates used the Escondido River to rest, to repair damages and to be provisioned. By then, the territory of the present municipality was populated by the native towns of Kukra and Branch. In 1602 one of these soldiers of fortune chose the bay of Bluefields as his center of operations due to its tactical advantages, a [[Dutch people|Dutchman]] named [[Abraham Blauvelt|Blauvelt]], and from him originates the name of the municipality.\n\nBlack Africans first appeared in the Caribbean coast in 1641, when a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ship that transported [[slave|slaves]] wrecked in the Miskito Cays. From the original settlement the bay began to be populated; the [[British Empire|English]] subjects burst in 1633 and from 1666 they were already organized into colonies, and by 1705 there were authorities established. In 1730 the [[Mosquito Coast|Kingdom of Mosquitia]] came to depend on the British government of [[Jamaica]]. For this, an alliance with the [[Miskito people]] was decisive, and the British provided them with armaments that allowed them to subdue the other ethnic groups of the Caribbean coast\u2014the [[African diaspora|Afro-descendant]] Creoles and the indigenous [[Sumo people|Mayangnas, Ulwas]], and [[Rama people|Ramas]]. \n\nIn 1740 the Miskitos yielded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[sovereignty]] over the territory, and in 1744 a transfer of British colonists was organized from Jamaica to the [[Mosquito Coast]]; they brought along with them black slaves. [[France|French]] citizens were also installed. The area was a British [[Protectorate]] until 1796, when Britain recognized the sovereignty of Spain on the Mosquito Coast; the British subjects also abandoned the islands, but the Spaniards did not take firm positions in them. \n\nWith the independence of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the area of the Mosquito Coast became part of Gran Colombia until its dissolution in 1831. Thereafter it became part of the Republic of New Granada, now Colombia, until, through the Esguerra-B\u00e1rcenas Treaty, the Colombian state formally ceded the territory to Nicaragua.\n\nThe [[Moravian Church]] was installed in 1847, and in 1860 the Miskito Reserve was created in the Caribbean Coast of [[Nicaragua]], by an agreement between the British and American governments in which Nicaragua as a country did not have part, and the British crown intervened again, putting it under its protection. The city of Bluefields was declared capital of that Reserve. \n\nOn the other hand, slaves originating in [[Jamaica]] that sought freedom on the Nicaraguan coast continued arriving during the greater part of the 19th century.\n\nThe plan of \u201cEuropeanization\u201d of the natives was completed by the 1880s, when British and Americans expanded the production of bananas and wood, creating an enclave [[economy]]; by the 1880 Bluefields was already a city of [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] character, with an intense commercial activity. \n\n[[Economic growth]] also brought a marked process of social differentiation, by which the races and [[ethnic group|ethnic groups]] were distributed spatially and in terms of work: the white population represented the interests of the foreign businesses; those of mixed race worked as [[artisan|artisans]] and in working-class occupations; the darker-skinned Creoles had their niche in physical work, and the native population were employed as servants and for other smaller works.  In 1894, the government of Nicaragua incorporated the Miskito Reserve into the national territory, extinguishing the Miskito [[monarchy]], and on October 11, 1903, Bluefields was proclaimed capital of the Department of Zelaya.\n\nIn recent years, however, due to US Coast Guard patrols attempting to intercept Colombian drug smugglers, cocaine (often referred to locally as \"white lobster\") has become an important part of the local economy. When threatened with potential boarding by US Coast Guard ships, cocaine smugglers try to dispose of their illegal cargo by throwing it overboard, simultaneously lightening their load for a faster escape and eliminating the evidence in case of capture. A percentage of the cocaine bales used to be carried by ocean currents into the lagoon around Bluefields. Residents may find the bales washed up on the beach or seek them by boat in the lagoon or at sea. In recent years this is not that common any more due to stricter legislation.\n\nBluefields remains a deeply impoverished city with extremely high rates of unemployment.\n\n== Climate ==\nAccording to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Bluefields features a trade-wind [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Af''). There is a drier period from February to April, but the [[trade winds]] ensure that unlike the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, rain still falls frequently during this period. For the rest of the year when tropical low pressure dominates rainfall is extremely heavy, helped by the coast being shaped in such a manner as to intercept winds from the south as prevail during the northern summer.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Bluefields, Nicaragua\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 27.8\n|Feb high C = 28.4\n|Mar high C = 29.0\n|Apr high C = 29.8\n|May high C = 29.9\n|Jun high C = 28.9\n|Jul high C = 28.1\n|Aug high C = 28.5\n|Sep high C = 29.1\n|Oct high C = 28.8\n|Nov high C = 28.4\n|Dec high C = 28.0\n|Jan mean C = 24.9\n|Feb mean C = 25.2\n|Mar mean C = 26.2\n|Apr mean C = 27.0\n|May mean C = 27.0\n|Jun mean C = 26.0\n|Jul mean C = 25.6\n|Aug mean C = 25.6\n|Sep mean C = 25.8\n|Oct mean C = 25.6\n|Nov mean C = 25.3\n|Dec mean C = 25.2\n|Jan low C = 22.2\n|Feb low C = 22.3\n|Mar low C = 23.3\n|Apr low C = 23.7\n|May low C = 24.2\n|Jun low C = 23.9\n|Jul low C = 23.7\n|Aug low C = 23.6\n|Sep low C = 23.5\n|Oct low C = 23.1\n|Nov low C = 22.8\n|Dec low C = 22.6\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 218\n|Feb precipitation mm = 114\n|Mar precipitation mm = 71\n|Apr precipitation mm = 101\n|May precipitation mm = 264\n|Jun precipitation mm = 581\n|Jul precipitation mm = 828\n|Aug precipitation mm = 638\n|Sep precipitation mm = 383\n|Oct precipitation mm = 418\n|Nov precipitation mm = 376\n|Dec precipitation mm = 328\n|Jan rain days = 19\n|Feb rain days = 13\n|Mar rain days = 10\n|Apr rain days = 10\n|May rain days = 15\n|Jun rain days = 23\n|Jul rain days = 26\n|Aug rain days = 25\n|Sep rain days = 21\n|Oct rain days = 21\n|Nov rain days = 20\n|Dec rain days = 22\n|unit rain days = 1.0 mm\n|source 1 = HKO<ref name=hko.com>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.weather.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/s_america/mx_cam/bluffields_e.htm|title=Climatological Normals of Bluefields, Nicaragua|accessdate=2012-03-13|publisher=Hong Kong Observatory }}</ref>\n|date=March 2012\n}}\n\n==Districts==\nThe city is located beside the eponymous bay; consisting of 17 neighborhoods including the port of [[El Bluff]], located on a peninsula of the same name.

There is now a highway from [[Nueva Guinea]] with regular bus service. The road was completed in May 2019, and was financed with loans from the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] and the [[World Bank]]. The road was formally declared open by President [[Daniel Ortega]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/nicaragua-completes-bluefields-nueva-guinea-highway|title=BNamericas - Nicaragua completes Bluefields-Nueva Guinea ...|website=BNamericas.com|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> \n\nVisitors usually either fly in to [[Bluefields Airport]] or take a bus from [[Managua]] and other cities or take a [[Panga (skiff)|Panga]] down the [[Escondido River (Nicaragua)|Rio Escondido]] from the city of [[El Rama]], which itself is accessible from Managua by bus.{{fact|date=October 2012}} In the town, taxis are readily available at a fixed price of 14 cordobas per person (2020) and work on a shared basis. The municipal wharf is the home of commercial boat traffic to Corn Island, LaBarra and many other locations which are only accessible by boat. Car ownership is very limited in Bluefields.\n\nThe municipal government does not provide all necessary services, so additional services related to water, energy, and sanitation are provided by non-governmental organization [[BlueEnergy]].\n\n==Popular Culture==\n*W.

For this, an alliance with the [[Miskito people]] was decisive, and the British provided them with armaments that allowed them to subdue the other ethnic groups of the Caribbean coast\u2014the [[African diaspora|Afro-descendant]] Creoles and the indigenous [[Sumo people|Mayangnas, Ulwas]], and [[Rama people|Ramas]]. \n\nIn 1740 the Miskitos yielded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[sovereignty]] over the territory, and in 1744 a transfer of British colonists was organized from Jamaica to the [[Mosquito Coast]]; they brought along with them black slaves. [[France|French]] citizens were also installed. The area was a British [[Protectorate]] until 1796, when Britain recognized the sovereignty of Spain on the Mosquito Coast; the British subjects also abandoned the islands, but the Spaniards did not take firm positions in them. \n\nWith the independence of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the area of the Mosquito Coast became part of Gran Colombia until its dissolution in 1831. Thereafter it became part of the Republic of New Granada, now Colombia, until, through the Esguerra-B\u00e1rcenas Treaty, the Colombian state formally ceded the territory to Nicaragua.\n\nThe [[Moravian Church]] was installed in 1847, and in 1860 the Miskito Reserve was created in the Caribbean Coast of [[Nicaragua]], by an agreement between the British and American governments in which Nicaragua as a country did not have part, and the British crown intervened again, putting it under its protection. The city of Bluefields was declared capital of that Reserve. \n\nOn the other hand, slaves originating in [[Jamaica]] that sought freedom on the Nicaraguan coast continued arriving during the greater part of the 19th century.\n\nThe plan of \u201cEuropeanization\u201d of the natives was completed by the 1880s, when British and Americans expanded the production of bananas and wood, creating an enclave [[economy]]; by the 1880 Bluefields was already a city of [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] character, with an intense commercial activity. \n\n[[Economic growth]] also brought a marked process of social differentiation, by which the races and [[ethnic group|ethnic groups]] were distributed spatially and in terms of work: the white population represented the interests of the foreign businesses; those of mixed race worked as [[artisan|artisans]] and in working-class occupations; the darker-skinned Creoles had their niche in physical work, and the native population were employed as servants and for other smaller works.  In 1894, the government of Nicaragua incorporated the Miskito Reserve into the national territory, extinguishing the Miskito [[monarchy]], and on October 11, 1903, Bluefields was proclaimed capital of the Department of Zelaya.\n\nIn recent years, however, due to US Coast Guard patrols attempting to intercept Colombian drug smugglers, cocaine (often referred to locally as \"white lobster\") has become an important part of the local economy. When threatened with potential boarding by US Coast Guard ships, cocaine smugglers try to dispose of their illegal cargo by throwing it overboard, simultaneously lightening their load for a faster escape and eliminating the evidence in case of capture. A percentage of the cocaine bales used to be carried by ocean currents into the lagoon around Bluefields. Residents may find the bales washed up on the beach or seek them by boat in the lagoon or at sea. In recent years this is not that common any more due to stricter legislation.\n\nBluefields remains a deeply impoverished city with extremely high rates of unemployment.\n\n== Climate ==\nAccording to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Bluefields features a trade-wind [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Af''). There is a drier period from February to April, but the [[trade winds]] ensure that unlike the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, rain still falls frequently during this period. For the rest of the year when tropical low pressure dominates rainfall is extremely heavy, helped by the coast being shaped in such a manner as to intercept winds from the south as prevail during the northern summer.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Bluefields, Nicaragua\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 27.8\n|Feb high C = 28.4\n|Mar high C = 29.0\n|Apr high C = 29.8\n|May high C = 29.9\n|Jun high C = 28.9\n|Jul high C = 28.1\n|Aug high C = 28.5\n|Sep high C = 29.1\n|Oct high C = 28.8\n|Nov high C = 28.4\n|Dec high C = 28.0\n|Jan mean C = 24.9\n|Feb mean C = 25.2\n|Mar mean C = 26.2\n|Apr mean C = 27.0\n|May mean C = 27.0\n|Jun mean C = 26.0\n|Jul mean C = 25.6\n|Aug mean C = 25.6\n|Sep mean C = 25.8\n|Oct mean C = 25.6\n|Nov mean C = 25.3\n|Dec mean C = 25.2\n|Jan low C = 22.2\n|Feb low C = 22.3\n|Mar low C = 23.3\n|Apr low C = 23.7\n|May low C = 24.2\n|Jun low C = 23.9\n|Jul low C = 23.7\n|Aug low C = 23.6\n|Sep low C = 23.5\n|Oct low C = 23.1\n|Nov low C = 22.8\n|Dec low C = 22.6\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 218\n|Feb precipitation mm = 114\n|Mar precipitation mm = 71\n|Apr precipitation mm = 101\n|May precipitation mm = 264\n|Jun precipitation mm = 581\n|Jul precipitation mm = 828\n|Aug precipitation mm = 638\n|Sep precipitation mm = 383\n|Oct precipitation mm = 418\n|Nov precipitation mm = 376\n|Dec precipitation mm = 328\n|Jan rain days = 19\n|Feb rain days = 13\n|Mar rain days = 10\n|Apr rain days = 10\n|May rain days = 15\n|Jun rain days = 23\n|Jul rain days = 26\n|Aug rain days = 25\n|Sep rain days = 21\n|Oct rain days = 21\n|Nov rain days = 20\n|Dec rain days = 22\n|unit rain days = 1.0 mm\n|source 1 = HKO<ref name=hko.com>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.weather.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/s_america/mx_cam/bluffields_e.htm|title=Climatological Normals of Bluefields, Nicaragua|accessdate=2012-03-13|publisher=Hong Kong Observatory }}</ref>\n|date=March 2012\n}}\n\n==Districts==\nThe city is located beside the eponymous bay; consisting of 17 neighborhoods including the port of [[El Bluff]], located on a peninsula of the same name.

He launched the [[Peoples Temple]] in [[Indiana]] during the 1950s. Rev.

U.S. Representative [[Leo Ryan]] led a delegation to the commune to investigate. Ryan and others were murdered by gunfire while boarding a return flight with some former cult members who had wished to leave.
