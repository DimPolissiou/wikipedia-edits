The country has missed only four contests, twice because the dates coincided with [[Remembrance of the Dead]] (1985, 1991) and twice because of being relegated due to poor results the previous year (1995 and 2002). The Netherlands hosted the contest in [[Hilversum]] ({{escyr|1958}}), [[Amsterdam]] ({{escyr|1970}}), twice in [[The Hague]] ({{escyr|1976}} and {{escyr|1980}}), and would've host the contest in [[Rotterdam]] in {{escyr|2020}}.\n\nThe Netherlands has won the contest five times, with [[Corry Brokken]] ({{escyr|1957}}), [[Teddy Scholten]] ({{escyr|1959}}), [[Lenny Kuhr]] in a four-way tie ({{escyr|1969}}), [[Teach-In (band)|Teach-In]] ({{escyr|1975}}) and [[Duncan Laurence]] ({{escyr|2019}}). The country's other top five results are [[Sandra Reemer|Sandra]] & [[Dries Holten|Andres]] fourth ({{escyr|1972}}), [[Mouth & MacNeal]] third ({{escyr|1974}}), [[Maggie MacNeal]] fifth ({{escyr|1980}}), [[Marcha]] fifth ({{escyr|1987}}), [[Edsilia Rombley]] fourth ({{escyr|1998}}), and second with [[The Common Linnets]] ({{escyr|2014}}). The Netherlands finished last in {{escyr|1958}}, {{escyr|1962}}, {{escyr|1963}}, {{escyr|1968}}, and in the semifinal in {{escyr|2011}}.\n\nAfter the introduction of the semifinals in 2004, the Netherlands failed to reach the final for eight years in a row from 2005 to 2012, the record of the contest, but have since reached six of the last seven finals.\n\n==History==\n\n===Fast Success===\n[[File:Eurovision Song Contest 1958 - Scoreboard.png|thumb|right|The {{Escyr|1958}} scoreboard]]\n\nThe Netherlands was one of seven countries competing in the inaugural {{Escyr|1956}} contest. [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NTS]] presented the [[Nationaal Songfestival]] to select Dutch entries to the contest. [[Corry Brokken]] and [[Jetty Paerl]] finished top two and qualified to Lugano. After a year, success came fast as \"[[Net als toen]]\" from Brokken won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957|1957]] contest in [[Frankfurt]]. This song is a ballad asking the husband about early days as a couple. This song received points from every single country. Sem Nijveen provided the violin solo. [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NTS]] hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1958|1958]] in [[Hilversum]]. Brokken's [[Heel de wereld]] received the first point from the first voting country, Switzerland, but it turned on to be the only point for her and finished tied ninth and last. Hosting and finishing last won't be repeated until Portugal in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018]]. Austria in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]] scored zero points but from tie-breaker finished SECOND last. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1959|1959]] in Cannes, the Netherlands was represented by [[Teddy Scholten]] after Brokken failed to qualify. [['n Beetje]] is about concentrating about being unfaithful in a relationship and focusing that unfaithful is real certain. The song led in some early stage before dramatic roller coaster voting occurred before [[Italy]] sent seven points to the Dutch and France sent four more for another Dutch victory.\n\n===First Dark Age===\n\n[[Rudi Carrell]] and [[Annie Palmen]] won the national final with [[Wat een geluk]] in 1960 before Carrell was selected for [[Eurovision Song Contest 1960|the night]] but the song finished 12th or second last. [[Greetje Kauffeld]] failed to win three selections before internally selected in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961|1961]] with [[Wat een dag]] finished tied tenth. [[YouTube]] still have a video from a classic Nationaal Songfestival 1962. Gert Timmerman and [[Conny Vandenbos]] headlined the show. [[De Spelbrekers]] won with a cute song \"[[Katinka (song)|Katinka]]\". This song is in the distinguished list for finishing last with 0 points but still being the more-remembered entries from the dark age. In 1963, The members of the orchestra declared strike action to cancel the televised selection. Palmen performed three songs for juries before \"Geen ander\" or \"[[Een speeldoos]]\" were selected. Veteran conductor [[Dolf van der Linden]] missed the contest also before finishing tied last with zero points again. Dutch-Indonesian [[Anneke Gr\u00f6nloh]] with \"[[Jij bent mijn leven]]\" finished tied tenth in 1964. 1965 Nationaal Songfestival brought five semi-finals to select the song for each entrant hosted by Teddy Scholten. Vandenbos won with \"[['t Is genoeg]]\" to go to [[Eurovision Song Contest 1965|1965]]. Norway gave top marks to save the song from 0 points, finishing 11th. [[Milly Scott]] was the first black performer to participate in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966]], last two voting countries [[Ireland]] and [[United Kingdom]] saved \"[[Fernando en Filippo]]\" from 0 points to finish 15th. A so little town of [[Harmelen]] hosted the 1967 selection before [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Steinmetz]] finished 14th with \"[[Ring-dinge-ding]]\" A year later, the Netherlands finished last again with \"[[Morgen]]\" from [[Ronnie Tober]].\n\n===From Lenny Kuhr to Teach-In===\n1969 Nationaal Songfestival brought Europe together by asking every single participating country in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|1969]] to vote with Dutch juries. Conny Vink's \"De toeteraar\" was beaten by [[Lenny Kuhr]]'s \"[[De troubadour]]\". Dolf van der Linden refused to go to [[Madrid]] and the song was conducted by Frans de Kok. This folk song about [[Troubadour]] didn't lead early in the voting before the third last country, France, gave six points to lead. The last two countries brought [[France]], [[UK]] and [[Spain]] tied for lead with 18 points. Those four countries all won and led to withdrawn countries in 1970. The Netherlands beat France in coin-toss to host [[Eurovision Song Contest 1970|1970]] in [[RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre|RAI Amsterdam]]. [[Hearts of Soul]] finished 7th with \"[[Waterman (song)|Waterman]]\". [[Saskia & Serge]] finished second in 1970 national final before being internally selected for [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]]. Ballad and beautiful \"[[Tijd]]\" finished tied sixth that night. That song was a farewell for Dolf van der Linden after 13 songs were conducted by him, two victories. [[Sandra Reemer|Sandra]] & [[Dries Holten|Andres]] with \"[[Als het om de liefde gaat]]\" provided memorable performance as the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]] audience clapped to the rhythm of the song. Belgium gave its neighbour only two points to finish fourth, one point behind Germany. After an old-fashioned \"[[De oude muzikant]]\" from [[Ben Cramer]] finished forgettable 14th in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]], the country sent the stars [[Mouth & MacNeal]] with \"[[I See a Star]]\", first Eurovision song in English for the country, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]]. This happy song had to faced stars like [[ABBA]], [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] before finishing third. 1975 Nationaal Songfestival was the first time since 1970 that singers weren't selected before the show. [[Teach-In]] with [[Ding-a-dong]] is a happy song with nonsensical titles and lyrics in both Dutch and English version. The performance finished by Ard Weeink broke the glass. This song received six twelves and almost 8.5 average, winning the contest for the fourth time, being the first song to win after singing first.\n\n===Multiple hostings===\n[[File:Sandra Reemer cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sandra Reemer]] with the outfit she wore in {{Escyr|1979}}]]\n[[The Hague]] hosted Eurovision 1976 in [[World Forum (The Hague)|Congresgebouw]] with former winner Corry Brokken presenting the show. [[Sandra Reemer]] returned with \"[[The Party's Over (Sandra Reemer song)|The Party's Over]]\" finished 9th. The country slumped to three non top-tens after, \"[[De mallemolen]]\" with Heddy Lester, 12th, \"[['t Is OK]]\" with Harmony, 13th, and Sandra's return \"[[Colorado (song)|Colorado]]\", 12th. Congresbouw returned to host [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980 contest]] after Israel declined for winning twice in a row, and actually withdrawn. [[Rogier van Otterloo]] made a debut as a conductor. Maggie MacNeal returned with patriotic ballad, \"[[Amsterdam (Maggie MacNeal song)|Amsterdam]]\". This short song was the first time in 1961 that was internally selected before the country selected the entries internally since 2013. The song led the voting after first three twelves from four countries. Sadly, only three more countries gave this top three and slipped to fifth. Linda Williams went to [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981]] with soft \"[[Het is een wonder]]\". Finished 7th. A year later, disaster struck as \"Fantasie eiland\" controversially missed the ticket because expert juries like Getty Kaspers sent \"[[Jij en ik]]\"  with [[Bill van Dijk]]. Later, \"Fantasie eiland\" went on to win OGAE Second Chance Retro 1982. Germany's five points led this song finished third last. 1983 Nationaal Songfestival is more dramatic. Vulcano's Een beetje van dit tied with Bernadette's \"[[Sing Me a Song]]\" before the last 30-people set of the jury gave the lady one point and the group none, sent her to Munich. The performance was satisfied however, finished 7th. After almost winning in 1981, [[Maribelle]] represented the country in 1984 with\"[[Ik hou van jou]]\", a stand-alone power ballad song. This well-known entry finished 13th before the first ever withdrawn in 1985.\n\n===Before the Dublin sinking===\n\nA girl group of [[Frizzle Sizzle]] was the Dutch entry in 1986 with happy \"[[Alles heeft ritme]]\" again finished 13th, but a year later it's satisfied. [[Marcha]] sang all six songs before upbeat \"[[Rechtop in de wind]]\" selected. Wearing in white, Marcha finished tied fifth, first top five since 1980. That song was the last ever conducted by van Otterloo before his death from cancer. [[Gerard Joling]] was preselected in 1988 before \"[[Shangri-la]]\", another upbeat entry, was selected. This song later finished ninth. From that song, one of the chorus member, Justine Pelmelay won the selection in 1989 but \"[[Blijf zoals je bent]]\" finished 15th. The country was represented by sisters [[Maywood (duo)|Maywood]] and a power ballad \"[[Ik wil alles met je delen]]\", finished 15th again. As the contest was held on May 4th, 1991, The Netherlands missed the 1991 contest. The group Humphrey Campbell won the selection with \"[[Wijs me de weg]]\", finished top ten in ninth. Another Suriname-background singer was selected for 1993, this time is [[Ruth Jacott]]. Some classic includes \"Blijf bij mij\" but in the end \"[[Vrede]]\" was the entry. This song has grabbed attention to this day. The result was good too, finishing sixth. [[Willeke Alberti]] was pre-selected for 1994 with the ballad \"[[Waar is de zon?]]\" which was later received just four points, finishing 23rd and relegated for 1995.\n\n===The Changing Era===\n\nNationaal Songfestival returned in 1996 with five semi-finals to select a song to each singer. Maxine and Franklin Brown represented the country with upbeat \"[[De eerste keer]]\". The song needed to qualify which was success finished ninth. [[Dick Bakker]] made a debut as a conductor, he co-wrote the winning entry in 1975. This song got seventh in the final night. 1997 was the bad year Mrs. Einstein with \"[[Niemand heeft nog tijd]]\" finished tied 22nd with just five points. Fortunately, good performance in the last five years is still enough to be invited to 1998 contest. Nurlaila's \"Alsof je bij me bent\" finished second in pre-selection but winning OGAE Second Chance Contest 1998. The entry was [[Edsilia]]'s \"[[Hemel en aarde]]\" an upbeat song filled with orchestra and it's not just fared well in the standings, it even led the voting as far as the 12th country, Slovenia, but later faded and finished fourth. However, this was the best showing since winning the contest in 1975. First year without orchestra was good for the country. [[Marlayne]] won very easily the Dutch final and after some hassle about the dress she came tied 8th with the song \"[[One Good Reason (Marlayne song)|One Good Reason]]\". In 2000, an enormous dress and a simple song couldn't do any good for singer [[Linda Wagenmakers]] who came 13th with the song \"[[No Goodbyes (Linda song)|No Goodbyes]]\". 2001 was the bad year, the slow ballad of [[Michelle Courtens|Michelle]] and her simple performance were the reasons that the Netherlands were not allowed to participate in 2002, finishing 18th. [[Esther Hart]] won the national final in 2003 with a sort of remake of the 1999 entry as the writing team was the same. After a chaotic performance, Esther finished in 13th place. The country sent the male duo [[Re-Union]] in 2004 with the song \"[[Without You (Re-Union song)|Without You]]\" and made it to the grand final. Hopes were high but they only managed to get 11 points and a 20th place. \n\n===The Modern Dark Age===\n\nIn 2005 the hopes were very high for Glennis Grace but she failed to reach the Grand Final just like the Treble trio did, a year later. In 2007 Edsilia was back but with her up-tempo song On Top Of The World she could not match the success of 1998. In 2008 Hind tried to do well with a 5 year old song but it didn't work out for her. In 2009 the Toppers did their utmost but Shine just wasn't good enough to qualify. The year after Sieneke won a very chaotic national final but she also failed to qualify with a sung in Dutch. Two more brave attempts in 2011 and 2012 also failed to qualify making the Netherlands on of the worst scoring countries during the 2004-2012 period.\n\n===The Dutch Renaissance===\n\nThe string of consecutive non-qualifications of much of the 2000s and early 2010s led the Dutch broadcaster to re-think their strategy in picking their entry for 2013.  [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]] was eventually chosen, Anouk chose the song and the background singers herself, and not only did she break the Netherlands' long non-qualification streak, she gave the country its first top 10 placing since 1999.  The following year, bookmakers downgraded [[The Common Linnets]]' chances of success going into the contest, yet the group proved them wrong by winning their semifinal and finishing second overall.  After a non-qualification with [[Trijntje Oosterhuis]] in 2015 who sang a song by Anouk, the Dutch then recorded four consecutive qualifications with [[Douwe Bob]] and [[OG3NE]] both finishing in 11th place in their respective appearances, and [[Waylon (singer)|Waylon]] placing 18th.  The \"Dutch Renaissance\" period in Eurovision hit a high point in 2019 with one of their strongest entries yet.  Having topped the bookmakers' odds from wire to wire, [[Duncan Laurence]] brought the country its 5th overall victory (tying France, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and first win in 44 years with his song \"[[Arcade (song)|Arcade]]\".\n\n==Non-participations==\nThe Netherlands has missed only four contests in its Eurovision history. The first one was at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985 contest]], held in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]]. The contest, held on 4 May conflicted with the Dutch [[Remembrance of the Dead]] and therefore the Netherlands withdrew.<ref>[http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=301#event_info_301 History - Eurovision Song Contest 1985] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926015328/http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=301 |date=2008-09-26 }} ''Eurovision.tv''</ref>\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]] the contest was again held on 4 May, and so the Netherlands withdrew for the same reason as six years earlier.<ref>[http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=307 History - Eurovision Song Contest 1991] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828143907/http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=307 |date=2008-08-28 }} ''Eurovision.tv''</ref>\n\nThere was no Dutch participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]] contests, due to relegation as a result of the country's poor showings in the previous year.\n\nThe Netherlands did compete in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]].

The country has missed only four contests, twice because the dates coincided with [[Remembrance of the Dead]] (1985, 1991) and twice because of being relegated due to poor results the previous year (1995 and 2002). The Netherlands hosted the contest in [[Hilversum]] ({{escyr|1958}}), [[Amsterdam]] ({{escyr|1970}}), twice in [[The Hague]] ({{escyr|1976}} and {{escyr|1980}}), and would've host the contest in [[Rotterdam]] in {{escyr|2020}}.\n\nThe Netherlands has won the contest five times, with [[Corry Brokken]] ({{escyr|1957}}), [[Teddy Scholten]] ({{escyr|1959}}), [[Lenny Kuhr]] in a four-way tie ({{escyr|1969}}), [[Teach-In (band)|Teach-In]] ({{escyr|1975}}) and [[Duncan Laurence]] ({{escyr|2019}}). The country's other top five results are [[Sandra Reemer|Sandra]] & [[Dries Holten|Andres]] fourth ({{escyr|1972}}), [[Mouth & MacNeal]] third ({{escyr|1974}}), [[Maggie MacNeal]] fifth ({{escyr|1980}}), [[Marcha]] fifth ({{escyr|1987}}), [[Edsilia Rombley]] fourth ({{escyr|1998}}), and second with [[The Common Linnets]] ({{escyr|2014}}). The Netherlands finished last in {{escyr|1958}}, {{escyr|1962}}, {{escyr|1963}}, {{escyr|1968}}, and in the semifinal in {{escyr|2011}}.\n\nAfter the introduction of the semifinals in 2004, the Netherlands failed to reach the final for eight years in a row from 2005 to 2012, the record of the contest, but have since reached six of the last seven finals.\n\n==History==\n\n===Fast Success===\n[[File:Eurovision Song Contest 1958 - Scoreboard.png|thumb|right|The {{Escyr|1958}} scoreboard]]\n\nThe Netherlands was one of seven countries competing in the inaugural {{Escyr|1956}} contest. [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NTS]] presented the [[Nationaal Songfestival]] to select Dutch entries to the contest. [[Corry Brokken]] and [[Jetty Paerl]] finished top two and qualified to Lugano. After a year, success came fast as \"[[Net als toen]]\" from Brokken won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957|1957]] contest in [[Frankfurt]]. This song is a ballad asking the husband about early days as a couple. This song received points from every single country. Sem Nijveen provided the violin solo. [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NTS]] hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1958|1958]] in [[Hilversum]]. Brokken's [[Heel de wereld]] received the first point from the first voting country, Switzerland, but it turned on to be the only point for her and finished tied ninth and last. Hosting and finishing last won't be repeated until Portugal in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018]]. Austria in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]] scored zero points but from tie-breaker finished SECOND last. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1959|1959]] in Cannes, the Netherlands was represented by [[Teddy Scholten]] after Brokken failed to qualify. [['n Beetje]] is about concentrating about being unfaithful in a relationship and focusing that unfaithful is real certain. The song led in some early stage before dramatic roller coaster voting occurred before [[Italy]] sent seven points to the Dutch and France sent four more for another Dutch victory.\n\n===First Dark Age===\n\n[[Rudi Carrell]] and [[Annie Palmen]] won the national final with [[Wat een geluk]] in 1960 before Carrell was selected for [[Eurovision Song Contest 1960|the night]] but the song finished 12th or second last. [[Greetje Kauffeld]] failed to win three selections before internally selected in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961|1961]] with [[Wat een dag]] finished tied tenth. [[YouTube]] still have a video from a classic Nationaal Songfestival 1962. Gert Timmerman and [[Conny Vandenbos]] headlined the show. [[De Spelbrekers]] won with a cute song \"[[Katinka (song)|Katinka]]\". This song is in the distinguished list for finishing last with 0 points but still being the more-remembered entries from the dark age. In 1963, The members of the orchestra declared strike action to cancel the televised selection. Palmen performed three songs for juries before \"Geen ander\" or \"[[Een speeldoos]]\" were selected. Veteran conductor [[Dolf van der Linden]] missed the contest also before finishing tied last with zero points again. Dutch-Indonesian [[Anneke Gr\u00f6nloh]] with \"[[Jij bent mijn leven]]\" finished tied tenth in 1964. 1965 Nationaal Songfestival brought five semi-finals to select the song for each entrant hosted by Teddy Scholten. Vandenbos won with \"[['t Is genoeg]]\" to go to [[Eurovision Song Contest 1965|1965]]. Norway gave top marks to save the song from 0 points, finishing 11th. [[Milly Scott]] was the first black performer to participate in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966]], last two voting countries [[Ireland]] and [[United Kingdom]] saved \"[[Fernando en Filippo]]\" from 0 points to finish 15th. A so little town of [[Harmelen]] hosted the 1967 selection before [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Steinmetz]] finished 14th with \"[[Ring-dinge-ding]]\" A year later, the Netherlands finished last again with \"[[Morgen]]\" from [[Ronnie Tober]].\n\n===From Lenny Kuhr to Teach-In===\n1969 Nationaal Songfestival brought Europe together by asking every single participating country in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|1969]] to vote with Dutch juries. Conny Vink's \"De toeteraar\" was beaten by [[Lenny Kuhr]]'s \"[[De troubadour]]\". Dolf van der Linden refused to go to [[Madrid]] and the song was conducted by Frans de Kok. This folk song about [[Troubadour]] didn't lead early in the voting before the third last country, France, gave six points to lead. The last two countries brought [[France]], [[UK]] and [[Spain]] tied for lead with 18 points. Those four countries all won and led to withdrawn countries in 1970. The Netherlands beat France in coin-toss to host [[Eurovision Song Contest 1970|1970]] in [[RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre|RAI Amsterdam]]. [[Hearts of Soul]] finished 7th with \"[[Waterman (song)|Waterman]]\". [[Saskia & Serge]] finished second in 1970 national final before being internally selected for [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]]. Ballad and beautiful \"[[Tijd]]\" finished tied sixth that night. That song was a farewell for Dolf van der Linden after 13 songs were conducted by him, two victories. [[Sandra Reemer|Sandra]] & [[Dries Holten|Andres]] with \"[[Als het om de liefde gaat]]\" provided memorable performance as the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]] audience clapped to the rhythm of the song. Belgium gave its neighbour only two points to finish fourth, one point behind Germany. After an old-fashioned \"[[De oude muzikant]]\" from [[Ben Cramer]] finished forgettable 14th in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]], the country sent the stars [[Mouth & MacNeal]] with \"[[I See a Star]]\", first Eurovision song in English for the country, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]]. This happy song had to faced stars like [[ABBA]], [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] before finishing third. 1975 Nationaal Songfestival was the first time since 1970 that singers weren't selected before the show. [[Teach-In]] with [[Ding-a-dong]] is a happy song with nonsensical titles and lyrics in both Dutch and English version. The performance finished by Ard Weeink broke the glass. This song received six twelves and almost 8.5 average, winning the contest for the fourth time, being the first song to win after singing first.\n\n===Multiple hostings===\n[[File:Sandra Reemer cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sandra Reemer]] with the outfit she wore in {{Escyr|1979}}]]\n[[The Hague]] hosted Eurovision 1976 in [[World Forum (The Hague)|Congresgebouw]] with former winner Corry Brokken presenting the show. [[Sandra Reemer]] returned with \"[[The Party's Over (Sandra Reemer song)|The Party's Over]]\" finished 9th. The country slumped to three non top-tens after, \"[[De mallemolen]]\" with Heddy Lester, 12th, \"[['t Is OK]]\" with Harmony, 13th, and Sandra's return \"[[Colorado (song)|Colorado]]\", 12th. Congresbouw returned to host [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980 contest]] after Israel declined for winning twice in a row, and actually withdrawn. [[Rogier van Otterloo]] made a debut as a conductor. Maggie MacNeal returned with patriotic ballad, \"[[Amsterdam (Maggie MacNeal song)|Amsterdam]]\". This short song was the first time in 1961 that was internally selected before the country selected the entries internally since 2013. The song led the voting after first three twelves from four countries. Sadly, only three more countries gave this top three and slipped to fifth. Linda Williams went to [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981]] with soft \"[[Het is een wonder]]\". Finished 7th. A year later, disaster struck as \"Fantasie eiland\" controversially missed the ticket because expert juries like Getty Kaspers sent \"[[Jij en ik]]\"  with [[Bill van Dijk]]. Later, \"Fantasie eiland\" went on to win OGAE Second Chance Retro 1982. Germany's five points led this song finished third last. 1983 Nationaal Songfestival is more dramatic. Vulcano's Een beetje van dit tied with Bernadette's \"[[Sing Me a Song]]\" before the last 30-people set of the jury gave the lady one point and the group none, sent her to Munich. The performance was satisfied however, finished 7th. After almost winning in 1981, [[Maribelle]] represented the country in 1984 with\"[[Ik hou van jou]]\", a stand-alone power ballad song. This well-known entry finished 13th before the first ever withdrawn in 1985.\n\n===Before the Dublin sinking===\n\nA girl group of [[Frizzle Sizzle]] was the Dutch entry in 1986 with happy \"[[Alles heeft ritme]]\" again finished 13th, but a year later it's satisfied. [[Marcha]] sang all six songs before upbeat \"[[Rechtop in de wind]]\" selected. Wearing in white, Marcha finished tied fifth, first top five since 1980. That song was the last ever conducted by van Otterloo before his death from cancer. [[Gerard Joling]] was preselected in 1988 before \"[[Shangri-la]]\", another upbeat entry, was selected. This song later finished ninth. From that song, one of the chorus member, Justine Pelmelay won the selection in 1989 but \"[[Blijf zoals je bent]]\" finished 15th. The country was represented by sisters [[Maywood (duo)|Maywood]] and a power ballad \"[[Ik wil alles met je delen]]\", finished 15th again. As the contest was held on May 4th, 1991, The Netherlands missed the 1991 contest. The group Humphrey Campbell won the selection with \"[[Wijs me de weg]]\", finished top ten in ninth. Another Suriname-background singer was selected for 1993, this time is [[Ruth Jacott]]. Some classic includes \"Blijf bij mij\" but in the end \"[[Vrede]]\" was the entry. This song has grabbed attention to this day. The result was good too, finishing sixth. [[Willeke Alberti]] was pre-selected for 1994 with the ballad \"[[Waar is de zon?]]\" which was later received just four points, finishing 23rd and relegated for 1995.\n\n===The Changing Era===\n\nNationaal Songfestival returned in 1996 with five semi-finals to select a song to each singer. Maxine and Franklin Brown represented the country with upbeat \"[[De eerste keer]]\". The song needed to qualify which was success finished ninth. [[Dick Bakker]] made a debut as a conductor, he co-wrote the winning entry in 1975. This song got seventh in the final night. 1997 was the bad year Mrs. Einstein with \"[[Niemand heeft nog tijd]]\" finished tied 22nd with just five points. Fortunately, good performance in the last five years is still enough to be invited to 1998 contest. Nurlaila's \"Alsof je bij me bent\" finished second in pre-selection but winning OGAE Second Chance Contest 1998. The entry was [[Edsilia]]'s \"[[Hemel en aarde]]\" an upbeat song filled with orchestra and it's not just fared well in the standings, it even led the voting as far as the 12th country, Slovenia, but later faded and finished fourth. However, this was the best showing since winning the contest in 1975. First year without orchestra was good for the country. [[Marlayne]] won very easily the Dutch final and after some hassle about the dress she came tied 8th with the song \"[[One Good Reason (Marlayne song)|One Good Reason]]\". In 2000, an enormous dress and a simple song couldn't do any good for singer [[Linda Wagenmakers]] who came 13th with the song \"[[No Goodbyes (Linda song)|No Goodbyes]]\". 2001 was the bad year, the slow ballad of [[Michelle Courtens|Michelle]] and her simple performance were the reasons that the Netherlands were not allowed to participate in 2002, finishing 18th. [[Esther Hart]] won the national final in 2003 with a sort of remake of the 1999 entry as the writing team was the same. After a chaotic performance, Esther finished in 13th place. The country sent the male duo [[Re-Union]] in 2004 with the song \"[[Without You (Re-Union song)|Without You]]\" and made it to the grand final. Hopes were high but they only managed to get 11 points and a 20th place. \n\n===The Modern Dark Age===\n\nIn 2005 the hopes were very high for Glennis Grace but she failed to reach the Grand Final just like the Treble trio did, a year later. In 2007 Edsilia was back but with her up-tempo song On Top Of The World she could not match the success of 1998. In 2008 Hind tried to do well with a 5 year old song but it didn't work out for her. In 2009 the Toppers did their utmost but Shine just wasn't good enough to qualify. The year after Sieneke won a very chaotic national final but she also failed to qualify with a sung in Dutch. Two more brave attempts in 2011 and 2012 also failed to qualify making the Netherlands on of the worst scoring countries during the 2004-2012 period.\n\n===The Dutch Renaissance===\n\nThe string of consecutive non-qualifications of much of the 2000s and early 2010s led the Dutch broadcaster to re-think their strategy in picking their entry for 2013.  [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]] was eventually chosen, Anouk chose the song and the background singers herself, and not only did she break the Netherlands' long non-qualification streak, she gave the country its first top 10 placing since 1999.  The following year, bookmakers downgraded [[The Common Linnets]]' chances of success going into the contest, yet the group proved them wrong by winning their semifinal and finishing second overall.  After a non-qualification with [[Trijntje Oosterhuis]] in 2015 who sang a song by Anouk, the Dutch then recorded four consecutive qualifications with [[Douwe Bob]] and [[OG3NE]] both finishing in 11th place in their respective appearances, and [[Waylon (singer)|Waylon]] placing 18th.  The \"Dutch Renaissance\" period in Eurovision hit a high point in 2019 with one of their strongest entries yet.  Having topped the bookmakers' odds from wire to wire, [[Duncan Laurence]] brought the country its 5th overall victory (tying France, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and first win in 44 years with his song \"[[Arcade (song)|Arcade]]\".\n\n==Non-participations==\nThe Netherlands has missed only four contests in its Eurovision history. The first one was at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985 contest]], held in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]]. The contest, held on 4 May conflicted with the Dutch [[Remembrance of the Dead]] and therefore the Netherlands withdrew.<ref>[http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=301#event_info_301 History - Eurovision Song Contest 1985] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926015328/http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=301 |date=2008-09-26 }} ''Eurovision.tv''</ref>\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]] the contest was again held on 4 May, and so the Netherlands withdrew for the same reason as six years earlier.<ref>[http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=307 History - Eurovision Song Contest 1991] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828143907/http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=307 |date=2008-08-28 }} ''Eurovision.tv''</ref>\n\nThere was no Dutch participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]] contests, due to relegation as a result of the country's poor showings in the previous year.\n\nThe Netherlands did compete in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]].

The primary feature of an AR relationship is whether a person ranks above or below each other person. Those higher in rank hold greater authority, prestige and privileges, while subordinates are entitled to guidance and protection. Military ranks are a prototypical example of an AR relationship.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n* '''Equality matching (EM)''' relationships are those characterized by various forms of one-for-one correspondence, such as turn taking, in-kind [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], tit-for-tat retaliation, or eye-for-an-eye revenge. Parties in EM relationships are primarily concerned with ensuring the relationship is in a balanced state. Non-intimate acquaintances are a prototypical example.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n* '''Market pricing (MP)''' relationships revolve around a model of proportionality where people attend to ratios and rates and relevant features are typically reduced to a single value or utility metric that allows the comparison (e.g., the price of a sale).

AR resembles an ordinal scale given that members of the relationship are placed in a linear ordering.

Military ranks are a prototypical example of an AR relationship.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n* '''Equality matching (EM)''' relationships are those characterized by various forms of one-for-one correspondence, such as turn taking, in-kind [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], tit-for-tat retaliation, or eye-for-an-eye revenge. Parties in EM relationships are primarily concerned with ensuring the relationship is in a balanced state. Non-intimate acquaintances are a prototypical example.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n* '''Market pricing (MP)''' relationships revolve around a model of proportionality where people attend to ratios and rates and relevant features are typically reduced to a single value or utility metric that allows the comparison (e.g., the price of a sale).

The only thing he and his company care about is money. They take thousands and thousands of dollars from players rewarding them nothing as their game performance and make fun of the players. The whole team he created is a selfish bunch of people who never cared about the quality and fan base but money. His game developing company [[Electronic Arts]] (EA) developed games like FIFA, MADDEN, SIMS, BATTLEFIELD etc. full with scripting and when greatest players and streamers of those games who promoted their games everyday speak about the harsh reality his company simply ban him/her. Moreover he is mentally abusing many players all over the world with such an unrewarding game. Many players are becoming mentally sick after such disgusting abuses from the game developed by his company.
