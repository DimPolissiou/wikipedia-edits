''1987'' was produced using extensive unauthorised [[Sampling (music)|samples]] that plagiarized a wide range of musical works, continuing a theme begun in the JAMs' debut single \"[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]\". These samples provided a deliberately provocative backdrop for [[beatbox]] rhythms and cryptic, political raps.\n\nShortly after [[independent record label|independent release]] in June 1987, the JAMs were ordered by the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]] to destroy all unsold copies of the album, following a complaint from [[ABBA]]. In response, the JAMs disposed of many copies of ''1987'' in unorthodox, publicised ways. They also released a version of the album titled ''1987 (The JAMs 45 Edits)'', stripped of all unauthorised samples to leave periods of protracted silence and so little audible content that it was formally classed as a [[12-inch single]].\n\nA limited edition release subjected to recall and a destruction order, ''1987'' became something of a rarity and by 2000, mint condition copies were trading for \u00a360.\n\n==Background and recording==\nOn New Year's Day 1987, [[Bill Drummond]] decided to make a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] record under the pseudonym \"the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu\".<ref>{{Cite episode |title=It's a Steal - Sampling |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00yrr89 |series=The Story of Pop |station=[[BBC Radio 1]] |number=48 |language=English|author1=[[Alan Freeman]] (host)|author2=[[Bill Drummond]] (interviewed)|minutes=31}} First broadcast in 1994, per {{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/03/the-story-of-pop|title=The Story Of Pop|publisher=[[BBC Radio 6 Music]] |access-date=9 March 2020}}<!--We used to link to a Radio 1 page which is now dead http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/STORY+OF+POP and an Australian page https://web.archive.org/web/20010218093054/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/pop/default.htm as backup, and the KLF FAQ for a transcript; but evidently the series has since been rebroadcast on Radio 6 and we now have live links.--></ref> Knowing little about modern [[music technology]], he invited [[Jimmy Cauty]], a former member of the band [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]], to join him.

''Sounds'' considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of [[Robin Hood]]: \"This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history\".<ref name=\"Sounds87Review\"/>\n\nThe first side of the LP closes with \"Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)\", a homage to [[Jimmy Cauty]] that plagiarises from an array of sources, including the \"[[Bo Diddley Beat]]\" and \"Sunrise Sunset\" from the ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' soundtrack.

The song also protests the involvement of cigarette companies in sport (\"When cancer is the killer/[[John Player & Sons|John Player]] run the [[John Player League|league]]\") and lambasts the \"tabloid mentality\" (\"They all keep talking about [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Di]]'s dress\").<ref name=\"Sounds87Review\"/> The [[Sex Pistols]]' \"[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]\" is briefly sampled.<ref name=\"MM1987\"/> After nearly three minutes of samples from the television show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', as well as sound clips from programmes and advertisements on other TV channels,<!--{{refn|group=n|The ''Top of the Pops'' edition is from 12 March 1987 and is interspersed with clips from what was being shown on other channels at the time: a golf match on [[BBC2]], advertisements from [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], and ''[[Channel 4 News]]''.}}--><!--source not stated at the time and I can no longer find it.--> Drummond cries \"Fuck that, let's have The JAMs!\".

''1987'' was produced using extensive unauthorised [[Sampling (music)|samples]] that plagiarized a wide range of musical works, continuing a theme begun in the JAMs' debut single \"[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]\". These samples provided a deliberately provocative backdrop for [[beatbox]] rhythms and cryptic, political raps.\n\nShortly after [[independent record label|independent release]] in June 1987, the JAMs were ordered by the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]] to destroy all unsold copies of the album, following a complaint from [[ABBA]]. In response, the JAMs disposed of many copies of ''1987'' in unorthodox, publicised ways. They also released a version of the album titled ''1987 (The JAMs 45 Edits)'', stripped of all unauthorised samples to leave periods of protracted silence and so little audible content that it was formally classed as a [[12-inch single]].\n\nA limited edition release subjected to recall and a destruction order, ''1987'' became something of a rarity and by 2000, mint condition copies were trading for \u00a360.\n\n==Background and recording==\nOn New Year's Day 1987, [[Bill Drummond]] decided to make a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] record under the pseudonym \"the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu\".<ref>{{Cite episode |title=It's a Steal - Sampling |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00yrr89 |series=The Story of Pop |station=[[BBC Radio 1]] |number=48 |language=English|author1=[[Alan Freeman]] (host)|author2=[[Bill Drummond]] (interviewed)|minutes=31}} First broadcast in 1994, per {{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/03/the-story-of-pop|title=The Story Of Pop|publisher=[[BBC Radio 6 Music]] |access-date=9 March 2020}}<!--We used to link to a Radio 1 page which is now dead http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/STORY+OF+POP and an Australian page https://web.archive.org/web/20010218093054/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/pop/default.htm as backup, and the KLF FAQ for a transcript; but evidently the series has since been rebroadcast on Radio 6 and we now have live links.--></ref> Knowing little about modern [[music technology]], he invited [[Jimmy Cauty]], a former member of the band [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]], to join him.

Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.<ref name=\"45edits\"/></blockquote>\n\nBy 2000, a copy of the original version of ''1987'' in [[mint condition]] was worth \u00a360, whereas a mint copy of \"1987: The JAMs 45 Edits\" was worth a mere \u00a310.<ref name=\"Hamlyn\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{The KLF}}\n{{featured article}}\n\n[[Category:1987 debut albums]]\n[[Category:The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu albums]]\n[[Category:KLF Communications albums]]\n[[Category:Recalled publications]]\n[[Category:Sampling controversies]]\n[[Category:Albums produced by The KLF]]\n[[Category:Hip hop albums by British artists]]<!--Please do not change these cats to English.

Its southern portion lies within [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], [[Russia]] and its northern within southwestern [[Lithuania]]. It is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] shared by the two countries.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Curonian Spit and Lagoon.png|thumb|left|Curonian Spit and Lagoon]]\nThe Curonian Spit stretches from the [[Sambia Peninsula]] on the south to its northern tip next to a narrow [[strait]], across which is the port city of [[Klaip\u0117da]] on the mainland of [[Lithuania]]. The northern 52&nbsp;km long stretch of the Curonian Spit peninsula belongs to Lithuania, while the rest is part of the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], [[Russia]]. The width of the spit varies from a minimum of 400&nbsp;m in Russia (near the village of Lesnoy) to a maximum of 3,800&nbsp;m in Lithuania (just north of [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]]).\n\n== Geologic history ==\nThe Curonian Spit was formed about 3rd millennium BC.<ref name=nationalpark>{{cite web|title=The Development of the Baltic Sea and the Curonian Lagoon|url=http://www.nerija.lt/en/nature/geology|publisher=[[Kur\u0161i\u0173 Nerija National Park]]|accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> A glacial [[moraine]] served as its foundation; winds and sea currents later contributed enough [[sand]] to raise and keep the formation above sea level.<ref name=nationalpark />\n\nThe existence of this narrow [[shoal]] is inherently threatened by the natural processes that govern shoreline features.<ref name=unesco>{{cite web|title=Curonian Spit|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/994|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> It depends on a dynamic balance between sand transport and deposition. If (hypothetically) the source area to the south-west were cut off, say, by a large port construction with a [[pier]], the Spit would [[erosion|erode]] and eventually disappear. It is thus a geologically speaking ephemeral coast element. The most likely development, however, is that the shallow bay inside the Curonian Spit will eventually fill up with [[sediment]], thus creating new land.\n\n== Human history ==\n=== Mythology ===\nAccording to [[Balt]]ic mythology, the Curonian Spit was formed by a [[Giant (mythology)|giantess]], [[Neringa (giant)|Neringa]], who was playing on the seashore. This child also appears in other myths (in some of which she is shown as a strong young woman, similar to a female version of the Greek [[Heracles]]). \n\n=== The Medieval period ===\nFrom ca. 800 to 1016, the Spit was the location of [[Mokhovoye, Kaliningrad Oblast|Kaup]], a major [[paganism|pagan]] trading centre which has not been [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] yet. The [[Teutonic Knights]] occupied the area in the 13th century, building their castles at [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] (1252), [[Guryevsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Neuhausen]] (1283), and at [[Rybachy, Kaliningrad Oblast|Rossitten]] (1372). The Spit may have been the home of the last living speaker of a now-extinct [[Baltic language]], [[Old Prussian language|Old Prussian]].<ref name=\"Krickus-2002\">{{cite book | title=The Kaliningrad question | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDOUZEEnHFUC&pg=PA17&dq=curonian+spit+existence&hl=en&ei=E6cXTM3FMYHknAeurNWiCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=curonian%20spit%20existence&f=false\n| first=Richard J. | last=Krickus | publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] | year=2002 | ISBN=978-0-7425-1705-9 | page=17 | access-date=2019-08-20\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Kursenieki habitation ===\n[[File:Curonians kursenieki in 1649.png|thumb|right|[[Kursenieki]] populated area in 1649]]\nSignificant human impacts on the area began in the 16th century.<ref name=nationalpark /> [[Deforestation]] of the spit due to [[overgrazing]], [[timber]] harvesting, and building of boats for the [[Battle of Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf]] in 1757 led to the dunes taking over the spit and burying entire villages. Alarmed by these problems, the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] government sponsored large-scale revegetation and [[reforestation]] efforts, which started in 1825.   Other sources credit George David Kuwert, the owner of a post station in Nida in the late 19th century, with beginning the spit's reforestation.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Owing to these efforts, much of the spit is now covered with forests. \n\nIn the 19th century the Curonian Spit was inhabited primarily by [[Kursenieki]], with a significant [[Germans|German]] minority in the south and a [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] minority in the north. The population of Kursenieki eventually dwindled due to assimilation and other reasons; it is close to non-existent these days and had been even before 1945, when the spit had become ethnic German.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\n=== Artists' colony ===\n[[File:Nida ThomasMann cottage.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Mann]]'s summer home]]\nFrom the late 19th century, the dune landscape around [[Nidden]] became popular with [[landscape art|landscape]] and [[animal painter]]s from the ''[[Kunstakademie K\u00f6nigsberg]]'' arts school. The local inn of Herman Blode was the nucleus of the [[Expressionism|expressionist]] artists' colony (''K\u00fcnstlerkolonie Nidden''). [[Lovis Corinth]] stayed here in 1890, followed by artists such as [[Max Pechstein]], [[Alfred Lichtwark]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]], and [[Alfred Partikel]].<ref name=\"W159\">Weise, p. 159</ref> Painters from K\u00f6nigsberg such as Julius Freymuth and Eduard Bischoff visited the area, as did poets like [[Ernst Wiechert]] and [[Carl Zuckmayer]].<ref name=\"W159\" /> Other guests included [[Ernst Kirchner]], Ernst Mollenhauer, [[Franz Domscheit]], and Herrmann Wirth. The painters usually took accommodations at Blode's hotel, and left some of their works with him. Some also built their own residences in the vicinity.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:Curonian Spit NP 05-2017 img17 aerial view at Epha Dune.jpg|thumb|Curonian Spit in Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia]]\nUntil the 20th century, most people in the area made their living by fishing. From 1901 to 1946 the village of Rossitten, now [[Rybachy, Kaliningrad Oblast|Rybachy]], became the site of the pioneering [[Rossitten Bird Observatory]], the world's first, founded by German [[ornithology|ornithologist]] [[Johannes Thienemann]] there because of the Spit's importance as a [[bird migration]] corridor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], [[Nidden]], together with the northern half of the Curonian Spit became part of the [[Klaip\u0117da Region]] according to the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] and was annexed by [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Lithuania]] in 1923. Officially renamed [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]], the village nevertheless remained a German-majority settlement \u2014 the border with the remaining [[East Prussia]]n half of the Spit lay only a few kilometres to the south.\n\nIn 1929 [[Nobel Prize]]-winning writer [[Thomas Mann]] visited Nida while on holiday in nearby [[Svetlogorsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Rauschen]] and decided to have a summer house erected on a hill above the Lagoon, mocked as ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (''Onkel Toms H\u00fctte'') by locals. He and his family spent the summers of 1930\u201332 in the thatched cottage, parts of the epic novel ''[[Joseph and His Brothers]]'' (''Joseph und seine Br\u00fcder'') were written here. Threatened by the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]], Mann left Germany after Hitler's ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' in 1933 and never returned to Nida. After the Klaip\u0117da Region was again annexed by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939, his house was seized at the behest of [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and served as a recreation home for ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' officers.\n\nThe German population was expelled by force after [[World War II]] by the occupying Soviet forces, accompanied by widespread [[ethnic cleansing]]. Like elsewhere in present-day [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], the assimilation of the territory and colonization by Russian settlers was completed by changing the historic German toponyms to Russian ones throughout the Russian-controlled part of the Spit.\n\n=== Today ===\nAfter the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]], tourism flourished; many Germans, mostly the descendants of the inhabitants of the area, choose the Curonian Spit (especially Nida, as no visas are needed for Germans in Lithuania) as their holiday destination.\n\n== Kursenieki ==\n{{details|Kursenieki}}\nWhile today the [[Kursenieki]], also known as Kur\u0161ininkai, are a nearly extinct [[Balts|Baltic]] ethnic group living along the Curonian Spit, in 1649 Kur\u0161ininkai settlement spanned from [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel (Klaip\u0117da)]] to [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig (Gda\u0144sk)]]. The Kur\u0161ininkai were eventually assimilated by the [[Germans]], except along the Curonian Spit where some still live. The Kur\u0161ininkai were considered [[Latvians]] until after [[World War I]], when [[Latvia]] gained independence from the [[Russian Empire]], a consideration based on linguistic arguments. This was the rationale for Latvian claims over the Curonian Spit, [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] and other territories of [[East Prussia]], which would be later dropped.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Kurenwimpel aus Nidden (2004).JPG|[[Kursenieki|Curonian]] pennant, Nida\nFile:Krikstas.jpg|[[Krik\u0161tas]] burial marker\nFile:Old cemetery in Nida.jpg|Old cemetery in [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]]\nFile:Viesbutis, Kavine in Nida.jpg|Small inn and cafe in [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]]\nFile:E\u0160ERIN\u0116, svetain\u0117 (9617446912).jpg|Fish restaurant in [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Current state ==\n[[File:Curonian Lagoon.jpg|thumb|Landsat photo]]\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    = \n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer    = Curonian Spit sand dunes in [[Nida, Lithuania]]\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background = \n | width     =\n | image1    = Nidos kopos.jpg\n | width1    = 180\n | caption1  =  \n | image2    = Nida sand dunes (August 6, 2007).jpg\n | width2    = 180\n | caption2  = \n}}\n\nThe Curonian Spit is home to the highest moving (drifting) sand dunes in [[Europe]].

The Russian side of the Curonian Spit belongs to [[Zelenogradsky District]] of the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], while the Lithuanian side is partitioned among [[Klaip\u0117da city municipality]] and [[Neringa municipality]].\n\nThere is a single road that traverses the whole length of the Curonian Spit. In the Russian side it goes to [[Zelenogradsk]], while on the Lithuanian side it goes to [[Smiltyn\u0117]]. The spit is not connected to mainland Lithuania. Car [[ferry|ferries]] provide a transportation link between [[Smiltyn\u0117]], located on the spit, and the port town of Klaip\u0117da.\n\nSince 2000, the Curonian Spit has been on  [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] under cultural criteria \"V\" (''an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture [...], or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change'').\n\nCurrently there is a demand to tear down a number of homes on the Curonian Spit.  These homes are owned by people who were given permits to build by corrupt local government officials.  The demand to tear the homes down is based on the fact that the Spit is a UN World Heritage Site and the only structures that were to be allowed outside official settlements were fishing shacks.<ref name=Controversy>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/lithuania-the-battle-for-the-curonian-spit/av-16281159|title=Lithuania:The Battle for the Curonian Spit|accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref>\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Wald der tanzenden B\u00e4ume01.jpg|thumb|The [[Dancing Forest]]]]\nThe largest town on the spit is [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]] in Lithuania, a popular [[holiday resort]], mostly frequented by Lithuanian and German tourists.  The northern shoreline of Curonian Spit is the site of [[beach]]es for tourists.\n\n=== Parnidis dune and sundial ===\nParnidis sand dune drifted by harsh winds is rising up to 52 meters above sea level.

Its southern portion lies within [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], [[Russia]] and its northern within southwestern [[Lithuania]]. It is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] shared by the two countries.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Curonian Spit and Lagoon.png|thumb|left|Curonian Spit and Lagoon]]\nThe Curonian Spit stretches from the [[Sambia Peninsula]] on the south to its northern tip next to a narrow [[strait]], across which is the port city of [[Klaip\u0117da]] on the mainland of [[Lithuania]]. The northern 52&nbsp;km long stretch of the Curonian Spit peninsula belongs to Lithuania, while the rest is part of the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], [[Russia]]. The width of the spit varies from a minimum of 400&nbsp;m in Russia (near the village of Lesnoy) to a maximum of 3,800&nbsp;m in Lithuania (just north of [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]]).\n\n== Geologic history ==\nThe Curonian Spit was formed about 3rd millennium BC.<ref name=nationalpark>{{cite web|title=The Development of the Baltic Sea and the Curonian Lagoon|url=http://www.nerija.lt/en/nature/geology|publisher=[[Kur\u0161i\u0173 Nerija National Park]]|accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> A glacial [[moraine]] served as its foundation; winds and sea currents later contributed enough [[sand]] to raise and keep the formation above sea level.<ref name=nationalpark />\n\nThe existence of this narrow [[shoal]] is inherently threatened by the natural processes that govern shoreline features.<ref name=unesco>{{cite web|title=Curonian Spit|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/994|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> It depends on a dynamic balance between sand transport and deposition. If (hypothetically) the source area to the south-west were cut off, say, by a large port construction with a [[pier]], the Spit would [[erosion|erode]] and eventually disappear. It is thus a geologically speaking ephemeral coast element. The most likely development, however, is that the shallow bay inside the Curonian Spit will eventually fill up with [[sediment]], thus creating new land.\n\n== Human history ==\n=== Mythology ===\nAccording to [[Balt]]ic mythology, the Curonian Spit was formed by a [[Giant (mythology)|giantess]], [[Neringa (giant)|Neringa]], who was playing on the seashore. This child also appears in other myths (in some of which she is shown as a strong young woman, similar to a female version of the Greek [[Heracles]]). \n\n=== The Medieval period ===\nFrom ca. 800 to 1016, the Spit was the location of [[Mokhovoye, Kaliningrad Oblast|Kaup]], a major [[paganism|pagan]] trading centre which has not been [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] yet. The [[Teutonic Knights]] occupied the area in the 13th century, building their castles at [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] (1252), [[Guryevsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Neuhausen]] (1283), and at [[Rybachy, Kaliningrad Oblast|Rossitten]] (1372). The Spit may have been the home of the last living speaker of a now-extinct [[Baltic language]], [[Old Prussian language|Old Prussian]].<ref name=\"Krickus-2002\">{{cite book | title=The Kaliningrad question | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDOUZEEnHFUC&pg=PA17&dq=curonian+spit+existence&hl=en&ei=E6cXTM3FMYHknAeurNWiCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=curonian%20spit%20existence&f=false\n| first=Richard J. | last=Krickus | publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] | year=2002 | ISBN=978-0-7425-1705-9 | page=17 | access-date=2019-08-20\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Kursenieki habitation ===\n[[File:Curonians kursenieki in 1649.png|thumb|right|[[Kursenieki]] populated area in 1649]]\nSignificant human impacts on the area began in the 16th century.<ref name=nationalpark /> [[Deforestation]] of the spit due to [[overgrazing]], [[timber]] harvesting, and building of boats for the [[Battle of Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf]] in 1757 led to the dunes taking over the spit and burying entire villages. Alarmed by these problems, the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] government sponsored large-scale revegetation and [[reforestation]] efforts, which started in 1825.   Other sources credit George David Kuwert, the owner of a post station in Nida in the late 19th century, with beginning the spit's reforestation.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Owing to these efforts, much of the spit is now covered with forests. \n\nIn the 19th century the Curonian Spit was inhabited primarily by [[Kursenieki]], with a significant [[Germans|German]] minority in the south and a [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] minority in the north. The population of Kursenieki eventually dwindled due to assimilation and other reasons; it is close to non-existent these days and had been even before 1945, when the spit had become ethnic German.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\n=== Artists' colony ===\n[[File:Nida ThomasMann cottage.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Mann]]'s summer home]]\nFrom the late 19th century, the dune landscape around [[Nidden]] became popular with [[landscape art|landscape]] and [[animal painter]]s from the ''[[Kunstakademie K\u00f6nigsberg]]'' arts school. The local inn of Herman Blode was the nucleus of the [[Expressionism|expressionist]] artists' colony (''K\u00fcnstlerkolonie Nidden''). [[Lovis Corinth]] stayed here in 1890, followed by artists such as [[Max Pechstein]], [[Alfred Lichtwark]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]], and [[Alfred Partikel]].<ref name=\"W159\">Weise, p. 159</ref> Painters from K\u00f6nigsberg such as Julius Freymuth and Eduard Bischoff visited the area, as did poets like [[Ernst Wiechert]] and [[Carl Zuckmayer]].<ref name=\"W159\" /> Other guests included [[Ernst Kirchner]], Ernst Mollenhauer, [[Franz Domscheit]], and Herrmann Wirth. The painters usually took accommodations at Blode's hotel, and left some of their works with him. Some also built their own residences in the vicinity.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:Curonian Spit NP 05-2017 img17 aerial view at Epha Dune.jpg|thumb|Curonian Spit in Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia]]\nUntil the 20th century, most people in the area made their living by fishing. From 1901 to 1946 the village of Rossitten, now [[Rybachy, Kaliningrad Oblast|Rybachy]], became the site of the pioneering [[Rossitten Bird Observatory]], the world's first, founded by German [[ornithology|ornithologist]] [[Johannes Thienemann]] there because of the Spit's importance as a [[bird migration]] corridor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], [[Nidden]], together with the northern half of the Curonian Spit became part of the [[Klaip\u0117da Region]] according to the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] and was annexed by [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Lithuania]] in 1923. Officially renamed [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]], the village nevertheless remained a German-majority settlement \u2014 the border with the remaining [[East Prussia]]n half of the Spit lay only a few kilometres to the south.\n\nIn 1929 [[Nobel Prize]]-winning writer [[Thomas Mann]] visited Nida while on holiday in nearby [[Svetlogorsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Rauschen]] and decided to have a summer house erected on a hill above the Lagoon, mocked as ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (''Onkel Toms H\u00fctte'') by locals. He and his family spent the summers of 1930\u201332 in the thatched cottage, parts of the epic novel ''[[Joseph and His Brothers]]'' (''Joseph und seine Br\u00fcder'') were written here. Threatened by the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]], Mann left Germany after Hitler's ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' in 1933 and never returned to Nida. After the Klaip\u0117da Region was again annexed by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939, his house was seized at the behest of [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and served as a recreation home for ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' officers.\n\nThe German population was expelled by force after [[World War II]] by the occupying Soviet forces, accompanied by widespread [[ethnic cleansing]]. Like elsewhere in present-day [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], the assimilation of the territory and colonization by Russian settlers was completed by changing the historic German toponyms to Russian ones throughout the Russian-controlled part of the Spit.\n\n=== Today ===\nAfter the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]], tourism flourished; many Germans, mostly the descendants of the inhabitants of the area, choose the Curonian Spit (especially Nida, as no visas are needed for Germans in Lithuania) as their holiday destination.\n\n== Kursenieki ==\n{{details|Kursenieki}}\nWhile today the [[Kursenieki]], also known as Kur\u0161ininkai, are a nearly extinct [[Balts|Baltic]] ethnic group living along the Curonian Spit, in 1649 Kur\u0161ininkai settlement spanned from [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel (Klaip\u0117da)]] to [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig (Gda\u0144sk)]]. The Kur\u0161ininkai were eventually assimilated by the [[Germans]], except along the Curonian Spit where some still live. The Kur\u0161ininkai were considered [[Latvians]] until after [[World War I]], when [[Latvia]] gained independence from the [[Russian Empire]], a consideration based on linguistic arguments. This was the rationale for Latvian claims over the Curonian Spit, [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] and other territories of [[East Prussia]], which would be later dropped.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Kurenwimpel aus Nidden (2004).JPG|[[Kursenieki|Curonian]] pennant, Nida\nFile:Krikstas.jpg|[[Krik\u0161tas]] burial marker\nFile:Old cemetery in Nida.jpg|Old cemetery in [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]]\nFile:Viesbutis, Kavine in Nida.jpg|Small inn and cafe in [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]]\nFile:E\u0160ERIN\u0116, svetain\u0117 (9617446912).jpg|Fish restaurant in [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Current state ==\n[[File:Curonian Lagoon.jpg|thumb|Landsat photo]]\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    = \n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer    = Curonian Spit sand dunes in [[Nida, Lithuania]]\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background = \n | width     =\n | image1    = Nidos kopos.jpg\n | width1    = 180\n | caption1  =  \n | image2    = Nida sand dunes (August 6, 2007).jpg\n | width2    = 180\n | caption2  = \n}}\n\nThe Curonian Spit is home to the highest moving (drifting) sand dunes in [[Europe]].

The Russian side of the Curonian Spit belongs to [[Zelenogradsky District]] of the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], while the Lithuanian side is partitioned among [[Klaip\u0117da city municipality]] and [[Neringa municipality]].\n\nThere is a single road that traverses the whole length of the Curonian Spit. In the Russian side it goes to [[Zelenogradsk]], while on the Lithuanian side it goes to [[Smiltyn\u0117]]. The spit is not connected to mainland Lithuania. Car [[ferry|ferries]] provide a transportation link between [[Smiltyn\u0117]], located on the spit, and the port town of Klaip\u0117da.\n\nSince 2000, the Curonian Spit has been on  [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] under cultural criteria \"V\" (''an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture [...], or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change'').\n\nCurrently there is a demand to tear down a number of homes on the Curonian Spit.  These homes are owned by people who were given permits to build by corrupt local government officials.  The demand to tear the homes down is based on the fact that the Spit is a UN World Heritage Site and the only structures that were to be allowed outside official settlements were fishing shacks.<ref name=Controversy>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/lithuania-the-battle-for-the-curonian-spit/av-16281159|title=Lithuania:The Battle for the Curonian Spit|accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref>\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Wald der tanzenden B\u00e4ume01.jpg|thumb|The [[Dancing Forest]]]]\nThe largest town on the spit is [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]] in Lithuania, a popular [[holiday resort]], mostly frequented by Lithuanian and German tourists.

Wittig successfully defended his thesis \u201cPurification and Characterization of the Four Lysine-Specific Transfer Ribonucleic Acids from Chicken Embryos\u201d ''(Reinigung und Charakterisierung der vier lysinspezifischen Transfer-Ribonukleins\u00e4uren aus H\u00fchnerembryonen)'' in 1976. He continued at Freie Universitaet Berlin, first as a postdoc (1976-1978) and later as an assistant professor (1978-1987).\n\nBetween 1976 and 1986, in addition to his work as a researcher, Wittig attended a variety of physics courses as a visiting student at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin (FUB), Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin (TUB), California Institute of Technology (CalTech) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to widen his scientific horizon. He received no official degree for these classes.\n\nIn 1980 Wittig habilitated for \u201cBiochemistry and Molecular Biology\u201d and became formally eligible for a full professorship in Germany.\n\nWittig was awarded a [http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/heisenberg/index.html Heisenberg scholarship] of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)]] in 1982/83 and worked as a fellow of the program until 1989. During this time, he was invited by scholars [[Edward Trifonov]], [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], Rehovot, and the late Koki Horikoshi, [[Riken|Riken Institute]] ([https://www.jst.go.jp/erato/en/research_area/completed/htkb_P.html ERATO superbug project]).\n\nFrom 1984 to 1986,  he was a visiting professor at [[Alexander Rich]]\u2019s lab at MIT and also cooperated with [[Alexander Varshavsky]]; in Wittig's own words \u201centering the most career-shaping times of his life\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Shuguang|last2=Wittig|first2=Burghardt|date=2015-06-01|title=Alexander Rich 1924\u20132015|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=33|issue=6|pages=593\u2013598|doi=10.1038/nbt.3262|pmid=26057974|issn=1087-0156}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Freie Universitaet Berlin awarded Wittig an extraordinary professorship (\u201cau\u00dferplanm\u00e4\u00dfige Professur\u201c). He continued to work as a visiting professor at MIT in  Rich's lab until 1989, when he became a full professor (S-C4, tenure) at Freie Universitaet Berlin (FUB) and was awarded the Schering Professorship of FUB. One year later, Wittig was tenured (C4, German Full Professorship) as founding chair and department head of [[Molecular biology|Molecular Biology]] and [[Bioinformatics]] at the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biochemistry (Institut f\u00fcr Molekularbiologie und Biochemie) at [[Freie Universitaet Berlin]].\n\nBy political administration and change of Berlin law (Berliner Universitaetsmedizingesetz) his institute became an entity of the fused medical faculties of [[Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin|FUB]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt-Universitaet]] zu Berlin, now named [[Charit\u00e9]] \u2013 Universitaetsmedizin. Wittig was Director of his Institute of Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics until 2010.\n\nIn 2010 Wittig returned his institute back to Freie Universitaet Berlin as a non-profit foundation with FUB as the trustee. He served as Chairman of the institute, now named Foundation Institute Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics, until 2017.\n\nBeginning in 1994, Wittig focused his research on the design, development, and clinical proof-of-concept of covalently closed DNA constructs for the treatment of [[cancer]] and for [[DNA vaccination|DNA-vaccines]] against [[infectious diseases]]. Two classes of DNA-molecules evolved through theoretical and experimental selection processes and became key technologies; MIDGE (minimalistic, immunogenically defined gene expression), and dSLIM for DNA-based immunomodulation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.biocentury.com/biotech-pharma-news/products/2003-07-14/product-development-dslimming-the-immune-system-a12a|title=dSLIMming the immune system|work=BioCentury|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTo enable the independent transition from basic research to DNA medicines, he founded Mologen AG in 1998.

During this time, he was invited by scholars [[Edward Trifonov]], [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], Rehovot, and the late Koki Horikoshi, [[Riken|Riken Institute]] ([https://www.jst.go.jp/erato/en/research_area/completed/htkb_P.html ERATO superbug project]).\n\nFrom 1984 to 1986,  he was a visiting professor at [[Alexander Rich]]\u2019s lab at MIT and also cooperated with [[Alexander Varshavsky]]; in Wittig's own words \u201centering the most career-shaping times of his life\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Shuguang|last2=Wittig|first2=Burghardt|date=2015-06-01|title=Alexander Rich 1924\u20132015|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=33|issue=6|pages=593\u2013598|doi=10.1038/nbt.3262|pmid=26057974|issn=1087-0156}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Freie Universitaet Berlin awarded Wittig an extraordinary professorship (\u201cau\u00dferplanm\u00e4\u00dfige Professur\u201c). He continued to work as a visiting professor at MIT in  Rich's lab until 1989, when he became a full professor (S-C4, tenure) at Freie Universitaet Berlin (FUB) and was awarded the Schering Professorship of FUB. One year later, Wittig was tenured (C4, German Full Professorship) as founding chair and department head of [[Molecular biology|Molecular Biology]] and [[Bioinformatics]] at the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biochemistry (Institut f\u00fcr Molekularbiologie und Biochemie) at [[Freie Universitaet Berlin]].\n\nBy political administration and change of Berlin law (Berliner Universitaetsmedizingesetz) his institute became an entity of the fused medical faculties of [[Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin|FUB]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt-Universitaet]] zu Berlin, now named [[Charit\u00e9]] \u2013 Universitaetsmedizin. Wittig was Director of his Institute of Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics until 2010.\n\nIn 2010 Wittig returned his institute back to Freie Universitaet Berlin as a non-profit foundation with FUB as the trustee. He served as Chairman of the institute, now named Foundation Institute Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics, until 2017.\n\nBeginning in 1994, Wittig focused his research on the design, development, and clinical proof-of-concept of covalently closed DNA constructs for the treatment of [[cancer]] and for [[DNA vaccination|DNA-vaccines]] against [[infectious diseases]]. Two classes of DNA-molecules evolved through theoretical and experimental selection processes and became key technologies; MIDGE (minimalistic, immunogenically defined gene expression), and dSLIM for DNA-based immunomodulation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.biocentury.com/biotech-pharma-news/products/2003-07-14/product-development-dslimming-the-immune-system-a12a|title=dSLIMming the immune system|work=BioCentury|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTo enable the independent transition from basic research to DNA medicines, he founded Mologen AG in 1998.

After the performance, Chanel rushes home to tell her mother about the show, but her mother is preoccupied preparing for a date with her new [[Parisian]] boyfriend to pay attention. Galleria comes home to her parents, who chastise her for not taking phone messages for her mother or walking their [[Bichon Frise]] dog, Toto. Meanwhile, Dorinda attends to her job, doing [[janitor|janitorial]] work at a community center.\n\nThe girls hope to become the first [[freshmen]] to win the [[talent show]] in their school's history. After a successful audition for the talent show, a famous [[alumnus]] of the school, Jackal Johnson, expresses interest in signing The Cheetah Girls to his [[record label]]. Galleria introduces herself as the founder and [[songwriter]] of The Cheetah Girls, which is not appreciated by the group's other members. While Galleria's mother, Dorothea, is initially hesitant to let The Cheetah Girls pursue the opportunity with Jackal, she eventually allows the girls to have a meeting after being encouraged by Galleria's father.\n\nThe meeting is a success, and despite some ongoing concerns from Galleria, the girls begin to prepare to record their first song. Without asking the group's other members for opinions, Galleria suggests that The Cheetah Girls should not make time for the talent show due to their record deal, and criticizes Dorinda for repeatedly wearing the same dull clothing. Aqua encourages Chanel, Galleria's oldest friend, to speak to Galleria about her behavior. Meanwhile, Dorinda has the opportunity to take a dance audition at the center where she is employed. She is offered a paying role because of her work, but taking on the role would require her to leave the Cheetah Girls.\n\nLater, Chanel becomes distressed after overhearing a [[voicemail]] suggesting that her mother was planning to sell their [[New York City]] apartment to move to Paris with her boyfriend. Feeling neglected, Chanel takes advantage of having her mother's credit card to go on a shopping spree on [[Madison Avenue]]. In an act of kindness, Chanel purchases a cheetah jacket for Dorinda who reveals her financial troubles: She is a poor [[foster child]] who lives in a 10-child household with a mother whose husband is a superintendent for the building. Chanel assures Dorinda that they will remain friends and she will always be a Cheetah Girl.\n\nAt the next meeting between The Cheetah Girls and Jackal Johnson, Jackal reveals that a marketing team has developed a new image for the group that will require them to wear masks and [[lip sync]]. Galleria is devastated by this and declares that the group refuse the offer, but the other girls stay behind due to their frustrations with Galleria's attitude. Galleria leaves under the impression that the other Cheetah Girls have taken the deal. Chanel arrives home where her mother reveals her credit card was declined due to Chanel's shopping spree. Chanel breaks down after thinking about how grateful she is for her mother given Dorinda's current status as a foster child, and Chanel's mother agrees to make more time for her daughter.\n\nLater, Galleria's dog Toto falls into an obstruction on the Manhattan streets. This attracts a great deal of attention, including a live news story, which alerts all four Cheetah Girls members about what is going on and causes them to come to Toto's rescue. Their singing helps calm Toto down and allow for his safe removal from the obstruction. This act of bonding ultimately causes the girls to repair their friendship, and they go on to sing a new song on the news for all of New York to see. Jackal Johnson arrives, voicing his regret trying to change The Cheetah Girl, but the girls refuse an offer with him. The Cheetah Girls end up winning the talent show, and the girls renew their commitment to achieving their dreams and maintaining their friendship.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] \u2013 [[Galleria Garibaldi]], also known as Bubbles\n* [[Adrienne Bailon]] \u2013 [[Chanel Simmons]], also known as Chuchie\n* [[Kiely Williams]] \u2013 [[Aquanetta Walker]], also known as Aqua\n* [[Sabrina Bryan]] \u2013 [[Dorinda Rogers|Dorinda Thomas]], also known as Do\n* [[Lynn Whitfield]] \u2013 Dorothea Garibaldi, Galleria's mother\n* [[Juan Chioran]] \u2013 Francobollo Garibaldi, Galleria's father\n* Lori Anne Alter \u2013 Juanita Simmons, Chanel's mother\n* [[Vince Corazza]] \u2013 Jackal Johnson, a record producer and the film's antagonist\n* [[Kyle Schmid]] \u2013 Derek, Galleria's love interest\n* Kyle Saunders \u2013 Pucci Simmons (Chanel's little brother)\n* [[Ennis Esmer]] \u2013 Rick (Comedian)\n* Johnie Chase \u2013 Doorman\n* [[Kim Roberts (actress)|Kim Roberts]] \u2013 Mrs. Bosco (Dorinda's foster mom)\n* Sandra Caldwell \u2013 Drinka Champane\n\n==Production==\nThe film was directed by [[Oz Scott]] and produced by [[Whitney Houston]], [[Debra Martin Chase]] and Co Producer Cheryl Hill.
