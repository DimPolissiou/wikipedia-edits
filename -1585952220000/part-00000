Approximately 7,000 were invited to settle in Canada; however, only a limited number accepted the offer, and the 2006 census reported 3,300 people of Ugandan origin in Canada.\n\nAmin's eight-year rule produced economic decline, social disintegration, and massive human rights violations. The [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Langi people|Langi]] ethnic groups were particular objects of Amin's political persecution because they had supported Obote and made up a large part of the army. In 1978, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] estimated that more than 100,000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin's reign of terror. Some authorities placed the figure as high as 300,000 \u2014 a statistic cited at the end of the 2006 movie [[The Last King of Scotland]], which chronicled part of Amin's dictatorship.\n\nA border altercation involving Ugandan exiles who had a camp close to the Ugandan border of Mutukula resulted in an attack by the Uganda army into Tanzania. In October 1978, the Tanzanian armed forces repulsed an incursion by Amin's troops into Tanzanian territory.

On 11 April 1979, [[Kampala]] was captured and Amin fled with his remaining forces to [[Libya]].\n\nAmin's reign ended after the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] in 1979, in which Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda. This led to the return of Obote, who was deposed again in 1985 by General [[Tito Okello]]. Okello ruled for six months until he was deposed. This occurred after the so-called \"[[Ugandan Bush War|bush war]]\" by the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) operating under the leadership of [[Yoweri Museveni]], and various rebel groups, including the Federal Democratic Movement of Andrew Kayiira, and another belonging to John Nkwaanga. During the Bush War the army carried out mass killings of non-combatants.<ref>Henry Wasswa, \u201cUganda's first prime minister, and two-time president, dead at 80,\u201d Associated Press, 10 October 2005</ref>\n\n==Uganda since 1979==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1979\u2013present)}}\nAfter Amin's removal, the Uganda National Liberation Front formed an interim government with [[Yusuf Lule]] as president and [[Jeremiah Lucas Opira]] as the Secretary General of the UNLF. This government adopted a ministerial system of administration and created a quasi-parliamentary organ known as the National Consultative Commission (NCC). The NCC and the Lule cabinet reflected widely differing political views. In June 1979, following a dispute over the extent of presidential powers, the NCC replaced Lule with [[Godfrey Binaisa]].\n\nIn a continuing dispute over the powers of the interim presidency, Binaisa was removed in May 1980. Thereafter, Uganda was ruled by a military commission chaired by [[Paulo Muwanga]]. The December 1980 elections returned the UPC to power under the leadership of [[Milton Obote|President Milton Obote]], with Muwanga serving as vice president. Under Obote, the security forces had one of the world's worst human rights records. In their efforts to stamp out an insurgency led by [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA), they laid waste to a substantial section of the country, especially in the Luwero area north of Kampala.\n\nObote ruled until 27 July 1985, when an army brigade, composed mostly of ethnic Acholi troops and commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]], took Kampala and proclaimed a military government. Obote fled to exile in [[Zambia]]. The new regime, headed by former defense force commander Gen. [[Tito Okello]] (no relation to Lt. Gen. Olara-Okello), opened negotiations with Museveni's insurgent forces and pledged to improve respect for human rights, end tribal rivalry, and conduct free and fair elections. In the meantime, massive human rights violations continued as the Okello government carried out a brutal counterinsurgency in an attempt to destroy the NRA's support.\n\n[[Image:Acholiland, Uganda.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Acholiland]] in the north.]]\nNegotiations between the Okello government and the NRA were conducted in [[Nairobi]] in the fall of 1985, with Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]] seeking a cease-fire and a coalition government in Uganda. Although agreeing in late 1985 to a cease-fire, the NRA continued fighting, and seized Kampala and the country in late January 1986, forcing Okello's forces to flee north into [[Sudan]]. Museveni's forces organized a government with Museveni as president.\n\nSince assuming power, the government dominated by the political grouping created by Museveni and his followers, the [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM or the \"Movement\"), has largely put an end to the human rights abuses of earlier governments, initiated substantial political liberalization and general press freedom, and instituted broad economic reforms after consultation with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and donor governments.\n\nIn northern areas such as [[Acholiland]], there has been armed resistance against the government since 1986. [[Acholi people|Acholi]]-based rebel groups included the [[Uganda People's Democratic Army]] and the [[Holy Spirit Movement]]. The only remaining rebel group is the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] headed by [[Joseph Kony]], which has carried out widespread abduction of children to serve as soldiers or sex slaves.\n\nIn 1996, Uganda was a key supporter of the overthrow of [[Zaire]]an President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in the [[First Congo War]] in favor of rebel leader [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]].\n\n===2000s===\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, the Ugandan army was involved in the [[Second Congo War]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Uganda continues to support rebel groups ther [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] and some factions of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]].\n\nAugust 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term if he wished to do so. In a [[Uganda multiparty referendum, 2005|referendum in July 2005]], 92.5 percent of voters supported the restoration of multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or \"movement\" system. [[Kizza Besigye]], Museveni's political rival, returned from exile in October 2005 and was a presidential candidate during the 2006 elections. In the same month, Obote died in South Africa. Museveni won the February 2006 presidential election.\n \nIn 2009, the [[Anti-Homosexuality Bill]] was proposed and under consideration.<ref name=\"bbc1\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8308912.stm BBC News: Uganda MP urges death for gay sex]</ref> It was proposed on 13 October 2009 by [[Member of Parliament]] [[David Bahati]] and, had it been enacted, would have broadened the criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda; introduced the death penalty for people who have previous convictions, are [[HIV]]-positive, or engage in sexual acts with those under 18;<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2009/10/15/ugandan-mp-proposes-that-gays-should-be-executed/ | title= Ugandan MP proposes that gays should be executed | newspaper= Pink News | first= Jessica | last= Geen | date=15 October 2009 | accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref> introduced [[extradition]] for those engaging in same-sex sexual relations outside Uganda; and, penalized individuals, companies, media organizations, or non-governmental organizations who supporteded [[LGBT]] rights.{{fact|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn 13 September 2014, the Ugandan security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the United States, identified and foiled a major [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] terrorist attack in Kampala, the capital city.

Museveni's forces organized a government with Museveni as president.\n\nSince assuming power, the government dominated by the political grouping created by Museveni and his followers, the [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM or the \"Movement\"), has largely put an end to the human rights abuses of earlier governments, initiated substantial political liberalization and general press freedom, and instituted broad economic reforms after consultation with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and donor governments.\n\nIn northern areas such as [[Acholiland]], there has been armed resistance against the government since 1986. [[Acholi people|Acholi]]-based rebel groups included the [[Uganda People's Democratic Army]] and the [[Holy Spirit Movement]]. The only remaining rebel group is the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] headed by [[Joseph Kony]], which has carried out widespread abduction of children to serve as soldiers or sex slaves.\n\nIn 1996, Uganda was a key supporter of the overthrow of [[Zaire]]an President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in the [[First Congo War]] in favor of rebel leader [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]].\n\n===2000s===\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, the Ugandan army was involved in the [[Second Congo War]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Uganda continues to support rebel groups ther [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] and some factions of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]].\n\nAugust 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term if he wished to do so. In a [[Uganda multiparty referendum, 2005|referendum in July 2005]], 92.5 percent of voters supported the restoration of multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or \"movement\" system. [[Kizza Besigye]], Museveni's political rival, returned from exile in October 2005 and was a presidential candidate during the 2006 elections. In the same month, Obote died in South Africa. Museveni won the February 2006 presidential election.\n \nIn 2009, the [[Anti-Homosexuality Bill]] was proposed and under consideration.<ref name=\"bbc1\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8308912.stm BBC News: Uganda MP urges death for gay sex]</ref> It was proposed on 13 October 2009 by [[Member of Parliament]] [[David Bahati]] and, had it been enacted, would have broadened the criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda; introduced the death penalty for people who have previous convictions, are [[HIV]]-positive, or engage in sexual acts with those under 18;<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2009/10/15/ugandan-mp-proposes-that-gays-should-be-executed/ | title= Ugandan MP proposes that gays should be executed | newspaper= Pink News | first= Jessica | last= Geen | date=15 October 2009 | accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref> introduced [[extradition]] for those engaging in same-sex sexual relations outside Uganda; and, penalized individuals, companies, media organizations, or non-governmental organizations who supporteded [[LGBT]] rights.{{fact|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn 13 September 2014, the Ugandan security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the United States, identified and foiled a major [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] terrorist attack in Kampala, the capital city.

A member of the [[Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation]] group from 1934\u201335, he joined the influential [[Surrealism|Surrealist movement]] in 1935 and was one of its prominent exponents until 1942. Whilst in exile in Mexico, he founded his own counter-surrealist art-magazine ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'', in which he summarized his critical attitude towards radical subjectivism and [[Freudo-Marxism]] in Surrealism with his philosophy of [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]. He rejoined the group between 1951 and 1954, during his sojourn in [[Paris]].\n\n== Family and childhood ==\n[[File:K\u00f6stlergasse 1.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to Paalen's birthplace, K\u00f6stlergasse 1, [[Vienna]]]]\nWolfgang Paalen was born in one of the famous ''Wienzeilenh\u00e4user'' designed by [[Otto Wagner]] in [[Vienna]] (K\u00f6stlergasse 1 / Linke Wienzeile No. 40), [[Austria]]. He was the first of four sons of the Austrian-Jewish merchant and inventor {{ill|Gustav Robert Paalen|de}}, and his German wife, the actress Clothilde Emilie Gunkel. Gustav Robert, who had Polish-[[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and Spanish-[[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] origins, converted to Protestantism in 1900 and changed his name from ''Pollak'' to ''Paalen'' in the same year.<ref>Neufert, Andreas (2015), ''Auf Liebe und Tod. Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin: Parthas, {{ISBN|978-3869640839}}, p. 35ff.(In [[German language|German]])</ref><ref>Registers of the Protestant Rectory Vienna (Evangelisches Pfarramt Wien), see also Anna Staudacher (2004), ''J\u00fcdisch-Protestantische Konvertiten in Wien 1782\u20131914'', Vienna, Part 2, p. 234</ref> His considerable wealth was based on modernist inventions and patents such as the [[vacuum cleaner]], the [[vacuum flask]], known under the name Thermos bottle, and the first flow-type heater (for [[Junkers]]), amongst others. In a relatively short period Gustav R. Paalen managed to ascend into the distinguished Viennese upper-class of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He became also a well known collector of [[Old Master]] paintings with masterpieces, like [[Francisco Goya]]\u00b4s ''Se\u00f1ora Sabasa Garcia'', which he had acquired from the Berlin patron [[Henri James Simon]] and is today one of the highlights of the National Gallery, Washington. As a friend of [[Wilhelm von Bode]] and member of the ''Freundeskreis des Kaiser-Friedrich Museums, Berlin'', he also financed the acquisition of the famous [[Titian]] painting ''Venus with the Organ-Player''.\n\n[[File:Sankt Rochusburg, Sagan.jpg|thumb|360px|Castle of the Paalen-family in [[\u017baga\u0144|Sagan]] from 1913-34]]\nThe first years of his life Wolfgang Paalen spent between Vienna and [[Styria]] where his father had opened the fashionable [[Spa|health resort]] [[Haselsdorf-Tobelbad|Tobelbad]], in the presence of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]], to whom he dedicated a [[memorial]] still visible today. In Tobelbad Paalen senior received such prominent guests as [[Gustav Mahler]], poet and artist Fritz von Herzmanovsky-Orlando, [[Julius Meier-Graefe]], Ida Zweig (the mother of [[Stefan Zweig]]), among others. Some sources claim that it was Paalen who introduced [[Alma Mahler]], during her visit in Tobelbad in 1910, to the German architect [[Walter Gropius]], whom she married later. 1912 the Paalen family moved to Berlin and to the [[Silesia]]n city of Sagan (today [[\u017baga\u0144]]), where his father had bought and rebuilt the castle of ''St. Rochusburg''. During [[World War I]] Gustav Robert served both empires, the Austrian and the German, with the organization of food supply and worked closely together with [[Walther Rathenau]] and [[Albert Ballin]]\u00b4s Zentral-Einkaufsgesellschaft. Wolfgang attended different schools in Sagan, and during the war his parents also engaged a private tutor. The teacher was also an organist who specialized in [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who thus became Wolfgang's favourite composer.<ref>Neufert, p. 86f.</ref>\n\n== Early teachers and decline of the family ==\nIn 1919 the family moved to [[Rome]], where they kept a luxurious household in the Villa Caetani on the [[Janiculum|Gianicolo]] and received many guests, such as the German painter [[:de:Leo von K\u00f6nig|Leo von K\u00f6nig]] (1871\u20131944) who became Wolfgang's first art teacher. It was in Rome, under the guidance of his father's friend, the archeologist [[Ludwig Pollak]], that he became an expert in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Classical archaeology|Roman archaeology]]. In 1923 he returned to Berlin alone to apply for the Academy. Although unsuccessful, he met his lifelong friend, companion and patron, the Swiss violinist, collector, filmmaker and photographer [[Eva Sulzer]] (Winterthur 1902 \u2013 1990 Mexico City).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Surrealism|last=Aspley|first=Keith|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2010|isbn=0810858479|location=|pages=454}}</ref> In 1925 he exhibited at the [[Berlin Secession]] and studied further in aesthetics, deeply influenced by [[Julius Meier-Graefe]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Schopenhauer]] and the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] theory of [[Max Wertheimer]]. It is here and with hypnopompic hallucinations in the castle in Sagan that he found the base for his later ideas of a deep entanglement of vision and outer world. After another year of studies, in [[Paris]] and [[Cassis]] (1925\u201326), where he met [[Roland Penrose]], [[Jean Varda]] (Janco) and [[Georges Braque]], he visited the art school of [[Hans Hofmann]] in Munich and, in 1928, [[Saint-Tropez]]. He then decided to settle in Paris. The year 1928 marks also the beginning of the decline of the family's splendour, once founded on the patriarchal rules of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. After a homoerotic affair with a mental healer, his younger brother Hans-Peter died unexpectedly in a Berlin [[History of psychiatric institutions|insane asylum]], presumably of suicide; the parents consequently separated; their mother's [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] disposition intensified as a result; the fortune of Gustav Paalen is quashed after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday, 1929]]. A later tragedy, crucial to Paalen's development, was his beloved brother Rainer's shooting himself in head with a pistol. Wolfgang witnessed the event, although Rainer survived, following treatment in a Berlin hospital and escaped from the city in 1933. He died in a mental hospital in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1942.<ref>Neufert (p. 138ff. and 159ff.) found evidence of this story, told by Luchita Hurtado, Paalen\u00b4s 2nd wife, in the correspondence of Rainer Paalen with his aunt Fini Gunkel</ref>\n\n== Paris and surrealism ==\n[[File:Wolfgang Paalen in Paris 1933.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Paalen in his studio apartment, [[Pernety (Paris M\u00e9tro)|rue Pernety]], [[Paris]], about 1933]]\nIn Paris he studied for a short time with [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]] and in 1933 became a member of the [[Abstraction-Creation]] group. He left the group in 1935, together with [[Hans Arp]] and [[Jean H\u00e9lion]]. His work at this time was inspired by [[Paul Valery]]\u00b4s ''Eupalinos'' and tends to macerate and condensate the abstract hardliners with regard to the Surrealists. The pictorial results may be seen as ''language games'': testing the point to which concrete forms may be reduced to latency and the point where they transmit multiple meanings. Paalen anticipated with this research, in a certain sense, the later attempts of such abstractionists as [[Mark Rothko]] (''Multiforms'') and [[Arshile Gorky]] and amplified his attempts to visualize his idea of human perception as deeply linked to a cosmic texture of latent or possible contents, with whom every organism is interweaved. In 1934 he married the French poet Alice Phillipot, later known as [[Alice Rahon]] and again met frequently with [[Roland Penrose]] and his wife [[Valentine Penrose|Valentine Bou\u00e9]], who brought the Paalens into contact with [[Paul Eluard]]. In the summer of 1935 he spent some time at the castle home of [[Lise Deharme]], where he met the Parisian [[Surrealists]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]]. An intense friendship developed almost immediately, and Breton involved his new adept in surrealist activities such as the ''Exposition surr\u00e9aliste d'objets'', which opened at the Galerie Charles Ratton in 1936. Here, Paalen showed ''L\u00b4heure exacte'' (The Exact Time), a clock with glass eyes and feather hands, which was displayed next to Giacometti's ''Boule suspendue'' (Suspended Ball). A small glazed showcase with clay idols called ''Aux bons soins du navigateur'' (At the Mercy of the Navigator) was shown, as was ''Le passage \u00e0 niveau'' (The Level Crossing), a wooden root elegantly leaning on a cork wall, along with two other objects made of roots: ''Le cr\u00e2ne de Voltaire'' (Voltaire's Skull) and ''Les cerveaux de Rembrandt'' (Rembrandt's Brains). That same year Paalen had a solo exhibition of paintings in Paris at the Galerie Pierre, owned by Breton's friend Pierre Loeb. Breton and Penrose included him in the organization of the International Surrealist Exhibition in London, where he presented twelve oils, gouaches and objects as well as his first [[fumage]] (''Dictated by a Candle'') representing a ghostly hand performing the act of painting. The contact with Breton deepened during that time and Paalen also participated in the design of Breton's Galerie Gradiva. There he met and worked  with [[Marcel Duchamp]] and presented his object ''Chaise envahie de lierre'', acquired in the gallery by [[Marie-Laure de Noailles]], who installed it in her famous bathroom, mentioned and illustrated in ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' in April 1938.<ref>''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', April 1938, S. 56, Ghislaine Wood, ''Surreal things. Making the fantastic real'', in: Wood, G. (2007), ''Surreal Things. Surrealism and Design'', London, p.6.</ref>\n\n===Fumage and first masterpieces===\n[[File:1936-003 Paalen.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[Pays interdit|Verbotenes Land]]'' (\"Forbidden Land\"), 1936]]\nIn the course of his association with the Surrealists and their attempts to transform [[automatic writing]] into drawing and painting, he created [[fumage]] \u2013 a technique for generating evocative patterns with the smoke and soot of a lit candle. Between 1936 and 1937 Paalen developed with these visionary-[[ephemeral]] forms on canvas, which he then mostly painted over in oil, a number of mature paintings which soon made his international reputation.\n\nThe further development in the work of Paalen continues to follow up the idea of a biological-evolutionary-physical-cosmological continuum, in which the human organism can evolve and unfold. Prelude for a series of oil-Fumages within the Surrealist group gave the discreet affair of [[Pablo Picasso]] with [[Alice Rahon]] which had led to an abortion.<ref>Alice\u00b4s love-letters to Picasso, practically unknown to the public, are stored in the Mus\u00e9e Picasso in Paris; see also Neufert, p. 181f. u. 250ff., who discovered the letters and gives ample insight into the affair and its literary output.</ref> The deep crisis of the couple and Paalen's first grave attack of depression led to his first important Surrealist masterpiece, ''[[Pays interdit]]'' (\"Forbidden Land\"), an apocalyptic landscape dominated by a female goddess and fallen, meteorite-like planets. Paalen had designed his personal model of the permeable poetic soul in the form of a cryptic, abyssal landscape, pervaded by a mixture of feminine mystique and romantic \u2018shock\u2019 imagery reminiscent of pre-Celtic faerie mysteries and their cosmic allusions, as these are known in the lyrical tradition of Brittany. This was also the first painting, into which he artfully integrated his fumage, in the extremely fine, crystalline execution of the lower section. In 1937 he realized many paintings in this style, including ''Fata Alaska''.\n\n===International Exhibition of Surrealism 1938 and surrealist objects===\n[[File:Wolfgang Paalen, Les \u00e9trangers 1937.jpg|thumb|''Les \u00e9trangers'', 1937]]\nTogether with Marcel Duchamp, [[Man Ray]] and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], Paalen was among those responsible for the design of the 1938 International Exhibition of [[Surrealism]] at the [[Palais des Beaux Arts]] in Paris, where he produced a floor, with dead leaves and mud from the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]], and an installation named ''Avant La Mare'', consisting of an artificial pond with water, real [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lilies]] and reeds, beneath Duchamp's ceiling of empty coal sacks. The doll Paalen decorated came with a silk scarf, a giant bat on her head and an eerie, mushroom-covered leaf-dress. It anticipated the barely-visible, floating, gliding totemic fairy creatures from his oil paintings with fumage that Pierre Colle would show the following June in his surrealist gallery. He also participated in the editorial of the catalogue, published as ''Dictionnaire abr\u00e9g\u00e9 du Surrealisme'' to the show, in which his most famous object, ''[[Nuage articul\u00e9]]'', was discreetly announced as a drawing. Recent research suggests that Paalen had a huge influence on the design of the exhibition's Great Hall. Other critics suggest that the entire installation was meant to imply the minatorial situation of the Surrealist group itself, reflected by the approaching war, as well as a huge mother's womb as [[vade mecum]] to fight the causes of the crisis, which were located in the paternalistic fixations of the whole epoch.<ref>Annabelle G\u00f6rgen, ''Exposition Internationale du Surr\u00e9alisme Paris 1938'', M\u00fcnchen 2008, see chapter on ''Wolfgang Paalen - Verbindung von Ausstellungsgestaltung und Einzelobjekt'', p. 113 ff.</ref> Paalen's biographer [[Andreas Neufert]], in particular, suggests the latter reading and sees the installation as a symptom of an ideological shift within Surrealism, away from Freud's rigid theory of the [[Oedipus complex]] to ideas centred on [[Otto Rank]]\u00b4s theory [[The Trauma of Birth]], with its recognition of the emotional nature of the child and its ties to the mother. This latter theory was represented and defended exclusively by Paalen and his wife [[Alice Rahon]] in this period.<ref>Neufert, p. 236, 255f., 308, 312ff. and 335</ref>\n\nThe erotic connotations of ''Nuage articul\u00e9'', with its umbrella covered with natural [[sponge]]s, embodied a dynamic sense of contradiction: bloom with stalk; sponge as symbol of nature, as a feminine utensil, which touched and cleaned naked female skin; umbrella as a masculine symbol of order and protection from natural forces. It thus became widely recognized among the Surrealists and their growing public. Geo Dupin, Paalen's sister-in-law, remembered that [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.]] had been extremely taken with Paalen's object and had chosen not to buy it, for the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]], only because it was too fragile and difficult to transport.<ref>Andreas Neufert, Conversations with Geo Dupin, Paris 1987, see also Neufert (2015), p. 303ff.</ref> ''Nuage articul\u00e9'' was published later in a more political context in the Surrealist magazine ''London Bulletin'', together with a text by [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] translated by [[Samuel Beckett]] with a comment that the sponge-umbrella would bring to mind another, sadly prominent, umbrella - that of [[Neville Chamberlain]] at the 1938 [[Munich Conference]] and the failure of the British policy of [[appeasement]].<ref>Mesens, E. L. T., (ed), ''London Bulletin'' (Feb. 1939), No. 10</ref> Besides ''Nuage articul\u00e9'', of which two versions are known and preserved<ref>Nuage articul\u00e9 I, (ex Collection Geo Dupin, Paris, now Moderna Museet, Stockholm, and ''Nuage articul\u00e9 II'', assembled by Paalen for the International Surrealist Exhibition in Mexico City 1940 (ex Collection Ines Amor, Mexico-City, now private collection, Berlin)</ref> In addition to ''Nuage articul\u00e9'', Paalen presented other objects in the 1938 surrealist exhibition, such as: ''Potence avec paratonnerre'' (Gallows with Lightning Rod), a larger-than-life wooden gibbet with lightning rods and a dedication plaque to the German philosopher and experimental physicist [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]]; ''Le moi et le soi'' (The Ego and the Id); and a version of ''Chaise envahie de lierre''. Perhaps inspired by the revolving doors used as movable walls for paintings and metaphorically called portes \u2018revolver\u2019 in the surrealist exhibition, Paalen designed a pistol shape from different small animal bones, which he fastened to a box with a tray and glass lid lined with black velvet. As in museum displays of valuable paleontological discoveries, he included its title on a copper plate inscribed \u2018Le g\u00e9nie de l'esp\u00e8ce\u2019 (The Genius, or Engineering, of the Species).\n\n===The paintings of 1938\u201339 and plans for Mexico===\n1938 he showed his new fumage paintings, which made his reputation as painter, in a show in ''Renou et Colle'' Gallery in Paris, with a catalogue text by Breton, written in [[Bermuda]] on his trip to Mexico. He published also the Lichtenberg-text ''G\u00f6ttinger Taschenalmanach'' in surrealist magazine ''[[Minotaure]]'' with illustrations by him. In 1938 the Paalens socialised with [[Frida Kahlo]] during her visit in Paris. She invited the couple to Mexico, where Paalen wanted to organize a Surrealist exhibition together with Breton.<ref>According to the correspondence with Kurt Seligmann, Paalen had the idea of organizing a great international exhibition in Mexico, see Stephan E. Hauser (1997), ''Kurt Seligmann 1900\u20131962: Leben und Werk'', Basel, p.168.</ref> It was Marcel Duchamp who recommended Paalen to Peggy Guggenheim and the New York dealer Julien Levy. \"Dear Julien, P. S. to my recent letter: Do you know Paalen\u2019s work? I suppose that you have seen some reproductions. Among the young Surr[ealists]\u2019s he ought to come out \u2013 he paints scenes \"for\" a sorcerer (you never see the witches). All this to hope that you might show him in N.Y\", Duchamp had already written to Levy in January 1939; in March he added a note about the invitation to the Guggenheim show: \u201cIn London with Mary [Reynolds] for a few days \u2013 Just came to see the last day of Paalen\u2019s show \u2013 His \u201csorcelleries\u201d look real on the walls \u2013 Hope you try them in N.Y.\"<ref>Marcel Duchamp, notes to Julien Levy, Januar/M\u00e4rz 1939, Julien Levy Gallery Records, University of Pennsylvania.</ref> After his one-man-show at the Guggenheim Jeune Gallery in Cork Street, London, as the first of the surrealists, he decided to leave Europe and travelled first to New York in May 1939 together with his wife Alice and friend [[Eva Sulzer]]. The same year he traveled through [[British Columbia]] where he collected a major totem house-screen with the representation of a bear-woman, accessible through a hole in the womb (now in the [[Denver Art Museum]]). His literary text ''Paysage tot\u00e9mique'', later published in his magazine ''DYN'', originates from the travel-notebooks, films and photographs of this voyage.<ref>Andreas Neufert has reconstructed the exact itinerary of this voyage, see \"Ten Rolls of 8mm Film Documenting Wolfgang Paalen\u00b4s Journey through British Columbia in Summer 1939\", essay, in: Dawn Ades (2011), ''The Colour of my Dreams: The Surrealist Revolution in Art'', Exhibition Catalogue, Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver, p. 229-235.</ref> In September he arrived in Mexico, where [[Diego Rivera]] and Frida Kahlo accompanied him to a house in [[Coyoac\u00e1n]], next to Kahlo's ''Casa Azul'' (The Blue House), which they had rented for him.\n\n===The first years of exile in Mexico===\n[[File:W.Paalen, Nuage articul\u00e9 II small.jpg|thumb|240px|The second version of ''[[Nuage articul\u00e9]]'', executed for the International Surrealist Exhibition in Mexico-City at the [[Galer\u00eda de Arte Mexicano]], 1940 (originally executed in 1937 for the International Surrealist Exhibition in [[Paris]], 1938)]]\nIn autumn 1939 he organized the International Surrealist Exhibition in the [[Galer\u00eda de Arte Mexicano]] together with the Peruvian poet [[C\u00e9sar Moro]], which opened in January 1940 in the [[Galer\u00eda de Arte Mexicano|new gallery rooms of Ines Amor]]. In April 1940 he showed his great Fumages and new experimental work, close to abstraction, in New York at [[Julien Levy]] gallery with great success. Reporters witness that Paalen at a certain point switched out the light and walked around with a burning candle during the opening, gathered by young American painters such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[William Baziotes]] and [[Gerome Kamrowski]].<ref>Neufert, p. 420</ref> Neither in Mexico, nor in New York he came in contact to [[Leon Trotsky]] or his assistant [[Jean van Heijenoort]] (who then was living in New York), albeit the commendatory letter, Breton had written already in Paris, hoping that Paalen would continue the contact, he had established during his trip to Mexico in 1938. Paalen justified his refusal in a letter to Breton with his general critique on the pseudo-religious paternal fixations of the Surrealists who, in his opinion, didn\u00b4t dispose of the means to find other ways out of the spiritual hole, the crisis of Marxism has left in their minds, than to look for new political fathers.<ref>see Neufert, p. 387ff., citing from the letters Paalen wrote to Breton f.e. Wolfgang Paalen to Andr\u00e9 Breton, Mai 3rd, 1940 (Biblioth\u00e8que Doucet, Paris)</ref> Back in Mexico he broke up with his former friends Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo across political opinions concerning their hard line in communism after the assassination of [[Leon Trotsky]] and their return to an open adoration of [[Joseph Stalin]]. More and more isolated from the Mexican intellectual leftists, he held an open household for European and American visitors, such as [[Roberto Matta]], Robert Motherwell, [[Gordon Onslow Ford]], [[Benjamin P\u00e9ret]], [[Remedios Varo]], [[Esteban Franc\u00e9s]] as well as refugees from the stalinist terror, like [[Gustav Regler]] and [[Victor Serge]]. He helped to organize immigration visas for the surrealists in Vichy-France through the ''Union Mexico-Francia'' and [[Julien Levy]]. During his first period of exile, Paalen concentrated on the verbalization of his ideas on art and, apart from occasional visits to New York, experimented secretly, in his studio in [[San \u00c1ngel]], in a new style on pictorial space.\n\n== The war years ==\n\n===''DYN''===\n[[File:WP DYN1.jpg|thumb|First issue of the magazine, [[Mexico]], 1942]]\nIn the spring of 1942 the New York art world witnessed the result of Paalen's intense work in the first years of exile in Mexico \u2013 the art journal ''[[DYN (journal)|DYN]]'' (derived from the Greek ''\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd'' \u2013 \"that which is possible\"). In its first issue he publicly announced to his friend Breton his ''Farewell to Surrealism''. In the second issue he scandalised his former advocate again by publishing a survey on [[Dialectical Materialism]] and an article with the provocative title ''The dialectical Gospel'', which caused a scandal among the New York Surrealists. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] then organized a symposium on dialectical materialism, with the Surrealists in Breton's apartment in New York, which revealed nothing but the inadequate knowledge of the artists on this field.<ref>see Lionel Abel: ''The Intellectual Follies. A Memoir of the Literary Venture in New York and Paris'', New York 1984, p. 89.</ref> In DYN Paalen theoretically hedged his concept of possibility on various levels, with [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], with his own concept of [[totemism]], [[gestalt psychology|gestalt]] theory, with his criticisms of dialectical materialism and western dualistic concepts, with his analysis of [[cave painting]], and so on.  By means of his journal, with a total of five issues published in Mexico between 1942 and 1944, he temporarily advanced to be one of the most influential art theorists in the wartime period. Even Breton admitted in 1944 that Paalen's criticism of Surrealism was justified and that \"we (the Surrealists) have left the whole licence to Paalen, who could say whatever he liked, without having the means to say something against or at least put something at his level. Paalen is winning on the whole line.\"<ref>Andr\u00e9 Breton in his letters to [[Benjamin P\u00e9ret]], 26 May and 31 May 1944 (Biblioth\u00e8que Doucet, Paris)</ref>\n\nIn seven large essays and countless smaller articles and reviews he discussed in detail the topical concerns of the young New York artists and, in response, received their full attention. Also his long article ''Totem Art'' had considerable influence on such artists, as [[Martha Graham]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Barnett Newman]], mainly because of the new conception of considering totemistic art as part of ecstatic action and ritual with its psychic links to generic memory and matrilinear ancestor-worship.<ref>Neufert, p. 494ff.</ref> With the exception of ''Totem Art'', all essays are republished under the title ''Form and Sense'' by [[Robert Motherwell]] in New York as the first issue of the series of writings titled ''Problems of Contemporary Art'' in which also the first papers of the later Abstract Expressionists, like ''Possibilities'', were published. Paalen's short sojourns in New York and the two solo exhibitions made him known as a painter in artist's circles, however his predominant absence from the New York art scene and the wide reception of ''DYN'' and ''Form and Sense'' fostered his image as a kind of intellectual secret agent primarily exerting indirect influence on the events through his intensely discussed ideas.\n\nIn a note with the title ''America has a new art movement (the first authentic art movement here)'' [[Barnett Newman]] listed Paalen together with Pollock, Rothko, Hoffman, Gorky, Baziotes and Motherwell as \"The men in the new art movement\"; Motherwell appears with a question mark, while Paalen is listed twice, once with the adding \"New\" (probably dividing Paalen's surrealist from his DYN-works).<ref>Barnett Newman\u00b4s notes from the years 1943-45 define also themes like \"The nature of this movement, a. The image complex, b. The problem of plastic form, c. The roots in American primitive art\", as well as \"The role of the artist\", themes, Paalen had discussed extensively in DYN. [Barnett Newman Foundation archive 18/103]</ref>\n\nThe German art historian [[Andreas Neufert]], who has extensively explored Paalen's life and work, suggested in his 2015 biography on the artist, that ''DYN'' and the New York surrealist journal ''[[VVV (magazine)|VVV]]'' were widely inspired by each other and can be seen partly as a hidden correspondence between Breton and Paalen.<ref>Neufert, see chapter ''Das DYN Projekt 1941-1944'', p. 433ff.</ref> This assumption has been already denoted (but not fully explored) by [[Yve-Alain Bois]] in 2004 in his contribution \"1942a - The depoliticization of the American avant-garde...\"<ref>in: Hal Foster, Rosalind Krauss, Yve-Alain Bois, Benjamin H.D. Buchloh, \"Art Since 1900, Modernism, Antimodernism, Postmodernism\", London (Thames & Hudson), p. 292f.</ref>\n\n===The new concept of space in painting===\n[[File:Wolfgang Paalen\u00b4s Studio in San Angel, Mexico, ca. 1946.jpg|thumb|280px|Interior of Paalen's studio in [[San \u00c1ngel]], with his painting ''Les Cosmogones'']]\nIt was in the 1940s that Paalen's art particularly played a major role in changing the conception of [[abstract art]]. Due to his magazine DYN, his presence and exhibitions in New York City, 1940 [[Julien Levy]], 1945 Peggy Guggenheim's The Art of This Century gallery and 1946 {{ill|Galerie Nierendorf|de}} in Berlin, he influenced significantly the genesis of [[Abstract Expressionism]]. Paintings such as ''Les premiers spaciales'' of 1941 set entirely on the new pictorial space because they concentrate on pictorially immanent means: Rhythm, light and colour.<ref name=Getty>{{cite web|last=Leddy|first=Annette|title=Getty Voices: The Forgotten Surrealist|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/getty-voices-the-forgotten-surrealist/|work=The Getty iris|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}</ref> Important is that they transform the rhythmical appearance of the fumage imprints into a neo-cubist rhythm, which Paalen then compares with the [[fugue]] and [[jazz]], through a mosaic-like fracture and complementary contrasts.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} He wants to create the atmosphere of a deeply moving, gripping encounter with beings that themselves remain silent. There is no action, no [[metamorphosis]] in them and nothing happens with them in the space. The picture itself is the being, or a frozen resonance of it. Precisely because of this total silence, every topical expectation put to them is reflected as a question. In a cartoon published by [[Ad Reinhardt]] in the fifties, Paalen's suggestion from ''Form and Sense'' is repeated: \"Paintings no longer represent; it is no longer the task of art to answer naive questions. Today it has become the role of the painting to look at the spectator and ask him: what do you represent?\" Gustav Regler wrote 1946 about this groundbreaking idea: \n{{Cquote|There is no greater fear of the numerous escapists of our time than that before the mirror. An amazing, breathtaking idea: to have a portrait asking the original what it is worth, how it lives up to what the painter saw. The old symbol of Dorian Gray. Paalen renewed it in his way. He doubts whether anybody today even knows what he represents. He dares to pretend that someone can grow by the painter. He has the same hope as Pygmalion, to fall in love with his creation and to be outgrown by it. He waits for the picture to renounce allegiance to its creator. He paints his portrait without human features.<ref>Gustav Regler, Wolfgang Paalen, New York (Nierendorf) 1946, p. 60f.</ref>}}\nPaalen understood his ''picture beings'' as a kind of pictorial version of the ancient ''choros tragicos'', the tragic [[chorus effect]], conceived in [[Nietzsche]]'s writing on ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]].'' It is the deep existential foundation of reality, what he is interested in. Although it becomes common practice after 1947, until this time, nobody had placed so much responsibility on the viewer as Paalen did with his rhetoric and pictorial language.\n\n== After the war ==\n\n===Archeological passions===\n1946 he divorced Alice and married the [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] designer and artist [[Luchita Hurtado]], whom he had met in New York through his friend [[Isamu Noguchi]]. Hurtado moved to Mexico in 1947 to live with Paalen and together they explored the ancient culture of the [[Olmec]], about which Paalen later published a widely respected article in the French art magazine ''[[Cahiers d'art]]''.<ref>Wolfgang Paalen, ''Le plus ancien visage du Nouveau Monde'', in: Cahiers d\u2019art 27 (1952), Nr. 2</ref> Paalen radicalizes the assumption of his friend and colleague [[Miguel Covarrubias]], that the Olmecs were a culture succumbed and (after hundreds of war-years) finally wiped out by the aggressive [[Maya civilization]], comparing the Olmecs to the ancient European matrilinear civilizations, which underlay invasive and more aggressive patriarchal civilizations some 3000 years ago. Paalen's thesis about the matrilinear social-structure of the ancient societies of Mesoamerica, which he documented with considerable support from his own research, was never substantially challenged and strongly influenced such artists as [[Alice Rahon]], [[Remedios Varo]] and [[Leonora Carrington]] in their archaist and feminist themes. His ideas still live on in the archaeological and artistic discourses, the most prominent popular example of recent times being Mel Gibson's cinematic opus ''[[Apocalypto]]'').\n\n===San Francisco, Paris===\nIn 1948 one of the two children, Luchita had brought from her former marriage into the household Paalen's, died in Mexico of Polio. Paalen decided to move to San Francisco with his new family, where he worked with [[Gordon Onslow Ford]] and [[Lee Mullican]] in a newly formed association, the [[Dynaton]] group. They settled in Mill Valley and had solo shows in the San Francisco Museum of Art as well as a group show at Stanford University Art Gallery, where he also lectured parts from the major essay on his new concept of space, he had worked on the last years. It was published in occasion of the DYNATON exhibition in San Francisco Museum of Art in 1951 as a catalogue.<ref>Wolfgang Paalen, ''Metaplastic'', ''Relativity of Measure'' and ''Theory of the Dynaton'', San Francisco Museum of Art, 1951</ref> Paalen's ongoing desire to go back to Mexico and rebuilt the link to Breton in Paris led to a divorce from Luchita Paalen, who decided to live with [[Lee Mullican]]. Back in Mexico Paalen organized 1951 a longer stay in Paris. Together with his new fianc\u00e9e, the American painter Marie Wilson, Paalen lived for the next 3 years in [[Kurt Seligmann]]\u00b4s atelier-building in the Impasse Villa Seurat in Paris, built by [[Andr\u00e9 Lur\u00e7at]]. He reconciled with Breton, spent most of the summers in Breton's house in Saint Cirq La Popie, participated at the invention of various surrealist games, like ''Ouvrez-Vous?'' and ''L\u2019un dans l\u2019autre'' and painted a considerable corpus of lyrical-abstract paintings, which were exhibited at Galerie Pierre (1953) and Galerie Galanis-Hentschel (1954). One of the four numbers of Breton's magazine ''Medium - Communication Surr\u00e9aliste'' is dedicated to Paalen.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Breton, ''Wolfgang Paalen'', in: ''Medium. Communication Surr\u00e9aliste'', Nr. 1 (Oct. 1953), p. 1</ref> After travelling through Germany in the summer of 1954 he went back again to Mexico.\n\n===Last years in Mexico and suicide===\nPaalen's last years in Mexico were characterized by increasing health problems, mainly originated in his bipolar (manic-depressive) disposition. With the help of his friends and patrons [[Eva Sulzer]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.getty.edu/eva-sulzer.htm|title=PRESS RELEASE: GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF PHOTOGRAPHS BY SWISS FILMMAKER AND PHOTOGRAPHER EVA SULZER (1902\u20131990)|last=|first=|date=September 26, 2012|website=The Getty|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref> and [[Gordon Onslow Ford]] he acquired an old house with studio in the small town [[Tepoztl\u00e1n]] in Morelos, where he mainly lived and worked during the last years of his life. Paradoxically Paalen produced a number of masterly works towards the end of this last period, as well as theatre plays and short stories, which reflect his ambivalent state of mind and growing depressions. His passion for Olmec sculpture and artefacts implicated him into adventurous expeditions into the wilderness of [[Yucat\u00e1n]], collecting and trading pre-Columbian art to an always growing US market. Rumours of Paalen having been involved in illegal looting of archaeological sites in Yucat\u00e1n inspired the American author and theologian [[Arthur A. Cohen]] to his novel ''Acts of Theft'' (1980). As expert and inspirator Wolfgang Paalen assisted the American filmmaker [[Albert Lewin]] for his film [[The Living Idol]].<ref>The Living Idol, Mexico/USA 1956, with Steve Forrest and Liliane Montevecchi</ref> 1958 he received [[Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues]] and [[Octavio Paz]] in Tepoztl\u00e1n, who both wrote texts on Paalen after his suicide.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues, ''La mort volontaire'', in: ''La Nouvelle Revue fran\u00e7aise'' (Dec. 1959), No. 84</ref><ref>Octavio Paz, ''Pr\u00e9face \u00e0 une exposition'', in: Catalogue of the memorial exhibition of Wolfgang Paalens in Librairie Loil\u00e9e, Paris 1960</ref> In the night of 25 September 1959 Paalen left his hotel room in the Hacienda San Francisco Cuadra in [[Taxco]], where he sometimes stayed during his depressions, and walked up the hill. The following day he was found dead with a gunshot to his head.<ref>Neufert (2015), p. 23, 611</ref>\n\n== Poet and writer ==\nAlthough Paalen is known chiefly as a visual artist, he also wrote poetry in [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], which he shared with [[Valentine Penrose]], [[Alice Rahon]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] and [[Paul Eluard]]. 1941 Breton reacted euphorically to Paalen's poetical diary of his voyage to [[British Columbia]] in the summer of 1939: \"I have read ''Paysage tot\u00e9mique'', re-read, read in a loud voice, nothing is more adorable, indubitably genial\".<ref>Andr\u00e9 Breton in a letter to Wolfgang Paalen, 31 July 1941 (Biblioth\u00e8que Doucet, Paris).</ref> ''Paysage tot\u00e9mique'' was partly published in his magazine ''[[DYN (journal)|DYN]]''. He also wrote three theatre plays and various unpublished stories, such as ''Der Axolotl'', ''Paloma Palomita''; his play ''The Beam of the Balance'', a tragic-comedy, reflects the unbroken power of [[Stalin]]\u00b4s totalitarian terror-regime, the release of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945 and the danger of the unbalanced scientific human mind in general. It was first read publicly in the house of [[Robert Motherwell]] in East Hampton in 1946.<ref>Amy Winter, Interview of Luchita Mullican, Santa Monica, 1 May 1994 (Archives of American Art, New York)</ref> His play ''Elorn, A Ballad from Brittany'' reflects his lifelong passion with pre-Celtic matrilinear cultures.\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe complete works of Paalen, canvases, objects and sculptures, were catalogued by art historian [[Andreas Neufert]] in his 1999 book ''Wolfgang Paalen: Im Inneren des Wals: Monography, and Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9''.<ref>Paalen, W.

The estate which Paalen left in the care of his close friend, the surrealist painter [[Gordon Onslow Ford]], is administrated by the Lucid Art Foundation in [[Inverness, California]], which recently restituted Paalen's rich archive of papers, photographs and manuscripts to the heirs of [[Eva Sulzer]], Paalen's only heir and executor.<ref>The ''Succession Wolfgang Paalen et Eva Sulzer'' is administrated by their fiduciary Andreas Neufert who also deals with all questions of copyright.</ref>\n\nBetween May and July 2007 a collection of his work was exhibited at the Frey Norris gallery in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surrealismcentre.ac.uk/papersofsurrealism/journal6/acrobat%20files/articles/merjianpdf.pdf|title=Wolfgang Paalen: Implicit Spaces.

He rejoined the group between 1951 and 1954, during his sojourn in [[Paris]].\n\n== Family and childhood ==\n[[File:K\u00f6stlergasse 1.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to Paalen's birthplace, K\u00f6stlergasse 1, [[Vienna]]]]\nWolfgang Paalen was born in one of the famous ''Wienzeilenh\u00e4user'' designed by [[Otto Wagner]] in [[Vienna]] (K\u00f6stlergasse 1 / Linke Wienzeile No. 40), [[Austria]]. He was the first of four sons of the Austrian-Jewish merchant and inventor {{ill|Gustav Robert Paalen|de}}, and his German wife, the actress Clothilde Emilie Gunkel. Gustav Robert, who had Polish-[[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and Spanish-[[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] origins, converted to Protestantism in 1900 and changed his name from ''Pollak'' to ''Paalen'' in the same year.<ref>Neufert, Andreas (2015), ''Auf Liebe und Tod.

In a relatively short period Gustav R. Paalen managed to ascend into the distinguished Viennese upper-class of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He became also a well known collector of [[Old Master]] paintings with masterpieces, like [[Francisco Goya]]\u00b4s ''Se\u00f1ora Sabasa Garcia'', which he had acquired from the Berlin patron [[Henri James Simon]] and is today one of the highlights of the National Gallery, Washington. As a friend of [[Wilhelm von Bode]] and member of the ''Freundeskreis des Kaiser-Friedrich Museums, Berlin'', he also financed the acquisition of the famous [[Titian]] painting ''Venus with the Organ-Player''.\n\n[[File:Sankt Rochusburg, Sagan.jpg|thumb|360px|Castle of the Paalen-family in [[\u017baga\u0144|Sagan]] from 1913-34]]\nThe first years of his life Wolfgang Paalen spent between Vienna and [[Styria]] where his father had opened the fashionable [[Spa|health resort]] [[Haselsdorf-Tobelbad|Tobelbad]], in the presence of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]], to whom he dedicated a [[memorial]] still visible today. In Tobelbad Paalen senior received such prominent guests as [[Gustav Mahler]], poet and artist Fritz von Herzmanovsky-Orlando, [[Julius Meier-Graefe]], Ida Zweig (the mother of [[Stefan Zweig]]), among others. Some sources claim that it was Paalen who introduced [[Alma Mahler]], during her visit in Tobelbad in 1910, to the German architect [[Walter Gropius]], whom she married later. 1912 the Paalen family moved to Berlin and to the [[Silesia]]n city of Sagan (today [[\u017baga\u0144]]), where his father had bought and rebuilt the castle of ''St. Rochusburg''. During [[World War I]] Gustav Robert served both empires, the Austrian and the German, with the organization of food supply and worked closely together with [[Walther Rathenau]] and [[Albert Ballin]]\u00b4s Zentral-Einkaufsgesellschaft. Wolfgang attended different schools in Sagan, and during the war his parents also engaged a private tutor. The teacher was also an organist who specialized in [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who thus became Wolfgang's favourite composer.<ref>Neufert, p. 86f.</ref>\n\n== Early teachers and decline of the family ==\nIn 1919 the family moved to [[Rome]], where they kept a luxurious household in the Villa Caetani on the [[Janiculum|Gianicolo]] and received many guests, such as the German painter [[:de:Leo von K\u00f6nig|Leo von K\u00f6nig]] (1871\u20131944) who became Wolfgang's first art teacher. It was in Rome, under the guidance of his father's friend, the archeologist [[Ludwig Pollak]], that he became an expert in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Classical archaeology|Roman archaeology]]. In 1923 he returned to Berlin alone to apply for the Academy. Although unsuccessful, he met his lifelong friend, companion and patron, the Swiss violinist, collector, filmmaker and photographer [[Eva Sulzer]] (Winterthur 1902 \u2013 1990 Mexico City).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Surrealism|last=Aspley|first=Keith|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2010|isbn=0810858479|location=|pages=454}}</ref> In 1925 he exhibited at the [[Berlin Secession]] and studied further in aesthetics, deeply influenced by [[Julius Meier-Graefe]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Schopenhauer]] and the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] theory of [[Max Wertheimer]]. It is here and with hypnopompic hallucinations in the castle in Sagan that he found the base for his later ideas of a deep entanglement of vision and outer world. After another year of studies, in [[Paris]] and [[Cassis]] (1925\u201326), where he met [[Roland Penrose]], [[Jean Varda]] (Janco) and [[Georges Braque]], he visited the art school of [[Hans Hofmann]] in Munich and, in 1928, [[Saint-Tropez]]. He then decided to settle in Paris. The year 1928 marks also the beginning of the decline of the family's splendour, once founded on the patriarchal rules of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. After a homoerotic affair with a mental healer, his younger brother Hans-Peter died unexpectedly in a Berlin [[History of psychiatric institutions|insane asylum]], presumably of suicide; the parents consequently separated; their mother's [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] disposition intensified as a result; the fortune of Gustav Paalen is quashed after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday, 1929]]. A later tragedy, crucial to Paalen's development, was his beloved brother Rainer's shooting himself in head with a pistol. Wolfgang witnessed the event, although Rainer survived, following treatment in a Berlin hospital and escaped from the city in 1933. He died in a mental hospital in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1942.<ref>Neufert (p. 138ff. and 159ff.) found evidence of this story, told by Luchita Hurtado, Paalen\u00b4s 2nd wife, in the correspondence of Rainer Paalen with his aunt Fini Gunkel</ref>\n\n== Paris and surrealism ==\n[[File:Wolfgang Paalen in Paris 1933.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Paalen in his studio apartment, [[Pernety (Paris M\u00e9tro)|rue Pernety]], [[Paris]], about 1933]]\nIn Paris he studied for a short time with [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]] and in 1933 became a member of the [[Abstraction-Creation]] group. He left the group in 1935, together with [[Hans Arp]] and [[Jean H\u00e9lion]]. His work at this time was inspired by [[Paul Valery]]\u00b4s ''Eupalinos'' and tends to macerate and condensate the abstract hardliners with regard to the Surrealists. The pictorial results may be seen as ''language games'': testing the point to which concrete forms may be reduced to latency and the point where they transmit multiple meanings. Paalen anticipated with this research, in a certain sense, the later attempts of such abstractionists as [[Mark Rothko]] (''Multiforms'') and [[Arshile Gorky]] and amplified his attempts to visualize his idea of human perception as deeply linked to a cosmic texture of latent or possible contents, with whom every organism is interweaved. In 1934 he married the French poet Alice Phillipot, later known as [[Alice Rahon]] and again met frequently with [[Roland Penrose]] and his wife [[Valentine Penrose|Valentine Bou\u00e9]], who brought the Paalens into contact with [[Paul Eluard]]. In the summer of 1935 he spent some time at the castle home of [[Lise Deharme]], where he met the Parisian [[Surrealists]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]]. An intense friendship developed almost immediately, and Breton involved his new adept in surrealist activities such as the ''Exposition surr\u00e9aliste d'objets'', which opened at the Galerie Charles Ratton in 1936. Here, Paalen showed ''L\u00b4heure exacte'' (The Exact Time), a clock with glass eyes and feather hands, which was displayed next to Giacometti's ''Boule suspendue'' (Suspended Ball). A small glazed showcase with clay idols called ''Aux bons soins du navigateur'' (At the Mercy of the Navigator) was shown, as was ''Le passage \u00e0 niveau'' (The Level Crossing), a wooden root elegantly leaning on a cork wall, along with two other objects made of roots: ''Le cr\u00e2ne de Voltaire'' (Voltaire's Skull) and ''Les cerveaux de Rembrandt'' (Rembrandt's Brains). That same year Paalen had a solo exhibition of paintings in Paris at the Galerie Pierre, owned by Breton's friend Pierre Loeb. Breton and Penrose included him in the organization of the International Surrealist Exhibition in London, where he presented twelve oils, gouaches and objects as well as his first [[fumage]] (''Dictated by a Candle'') representing a ghostly hand performing the act of painting. The contact with Breton deepened during that time and Paalen also participated in the design of Breton's Galerie Gradiva. There he met and worked  with [[Marcel Duchamp]] and presented his object ''Chaise envahie de lierre'', acquired in the gallery by [[Marie-Laure de Noailles]], who installed it in her famous bathroom, mentioned and illustrated in ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' in April 1938.<ref>''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', April 1938, S. 56, Ghislaine Wood, ''Surreal things. Making the fantastic real'', in: Wood, G. (2007), ''Surreal Things. Surrealism and Design'', London, p.6.</ref>\n\n===Fumage and first masterpieces===\n[[File:1936-003 Paalen.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[Pays interdit|Verbotenes Land]]'' (\"Forbidden Land\"), 1936]]\nIn the course of his association with the Surrealists and their attempts to transform [[automatic writing]] into drawing and painting, he created [[fumage]] \u2013 a technique for generating evocative patterns with the smoke and soot of a lit candle. Between 1936 and 1937 Paalen developed with these visionary-[[ephemeral]] forms on canvas, which he then mostly painted over in oil, a number of mature paintings which soon made his international reputation.\n\nThe further development in the work of Paalen continues to follow up the idea of a biological-evolutionary-physical-cosmological continuum, in which the human organism can evolve and unfold. Prelude for a series of oil-Fumages within the Surrealist group gave the discreet affair of [[Pablo Picasso]] with [[Alice Rahon]] which had led to an abortion.<ref>Alice\u00b4s love-letters to Picasso, practically unknown to the public, are stored in the Mus\u00e9e Picasso in Paris; see also Neufert, p. 181f. u. 250ff., who discovered the letters and gives ample insight into the affair and its literary output.</ref> The deep crisis of the couple and Paalen's first grave attack of depression led to his first important Surrealist masterpiece, ''[[Pays interdit]]'' (\"Forbidden Land\"), an apocalyptic landscape dominated by a female goddess and fallen, meteorite-like planets. Paalen had designed his personal model of the permeable poetic soul in the form of a cryptic, abyssal landscape, pervaded by a mixture of feminine mystique and romantic \u2018shock\u2019 imagery reminiscent of pre-Celtic faerie mysteries and their cosmic allusions, as these are known in the lyrical tradition of Brittany. This was also the first painting, into which he artfully integrated his fumage, in the extremely fine, crystalline execution of the lower section. In 1937 he realized many paintings in this style, including ''Fata Alaska''.\n\n===International Exhibition of Surrealism 1938 and surrealist objects===\n[[File:Wolfgang Paalen, Les \u00e9trangers 1937.jpg|thumb|''Les \u00e9trangers'', 1937]]\nTogether with Marcel Duchamp, [[Man Ray]] and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], Paalen was among those responsible for the design of the 1938 International Exhibition of [[Surrealism]] at the [[Palais des Beaux Arts]] in Paris, where he produced a floor, with dead leaves and mud from the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]], and an installation named ''Avant La Mare'', consisting of an artificial pond with water, real [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lilies]] and reeds, beneath Duchamp's ceiling of empty coal sacks. The doll Paalen decorated came with a silk scarf, a giant bat on her head and an eerie, mushroom-covered leaf-dress. It anticipated the barely-visible, floating, gliding totemic fairy creatures from his oil paintings with fumage that Pierre Colle would show the following June in his surrealist gallery. He also participated in the editorial of the catalogue, published as ''Dictionnaire abr\u00e9g\u00e9 du Surrealisme'' to the show, in which his most famous object, ''[[Nuage articul\u00e9]]'', was discreetly announced as a drawing. Recent research suggests that Paalen had a huge influence on the design of the exhibition's Great Hall. Other critics suggest that the entire installation was meant to imply the minatorial situation of the Surrealist group itself, reflected by the approaching war, as well as a huge mother's womb as [[vade mecum]] to fight the causes of the crisis, which were located in the paternalistic fixations of the whole epoch.<ref>Annabelle G\u00f6rgen, ''Exposition Internationale du Surr\u00e9alisme Paris 1938'', M\u00fcnchen 2008, see chapter on ''Wolfgang Paalen - Verbindung von Ausstellungsgestaltung und Einzelobjekt'', p. 113 ff.</ref> Paalen's biographer [[Andreas Neufert]], in particular, suggests the latter reading and sees the installation as a symptom of an ideological shift within Surrealism, away from Freud's rigid theory of the [[Oedipus complex]] to ideas centred on [[Otto Rank]]\u00b4s theory [[The Trauma of Birth]], with its recognition of the emotional nature of the child and its ties to the mother. This latter theory was represented and defended exclusively by Paalen and his wife [[Alice Rahon]] in this period.<ref>Neufert, p. 236, 255f., 308, 312ff. and 335</ref>\n\nThe erotic connotations of ''Nuage articul\u00e9'', with its umbrella covered with natural [[sponge]]s, embodied a dynamic sense of contradiction: bloom with stalk; sponge as symbol of nature, as a feminine utensil, which touched and cleaned naked female skin; umbrella as a masculine symbol of order and protection from natural forces. It thus became widely recognized among the Surrealists and their growing public. Geo Dupin, Paalen's sister-in-law, remembered that [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.]] had been extremely taken with Paalen's object and had chosen not to buy it, for the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]], only because it was too fragile and difficult to transport.<ref>Andreas Neufert, Conversations with Geo Dupin, Paris 1987, see also Neufert (2015), p. 303ff.</ref> ''Nuage articul\u00e9'' was published later in a more political context in the Surrealist magazine ''London Bulletin'', together with a text by [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] translated by [[Samuel Beckett]] with a comment that the sponge-umbrella would bring to mind another, sadly prominent, umbrella - that of [[Neville Chamberlain]] at the 1938 [[Munich Conference]] and the failure of the British policy of [[appeasement]].<ref>Mesens, E. L. T., (ed), ''London Bulletin'' (Feb. 1939), No. 10</ref> Besides ''Nuage articul\u00e9'', of which two versions are known and preserved<ref>Nuage articul\u00e9 I, (ex Collection Geo Dupin, Paris, now Moderna Museet, Stockholm, and ''Nuage articul\u00e9 II'', assembled by Paalen for the International Surrealist Exhibition in Mexico City 1940 (ex Collection Ines Amor, Mexico-City, now private collection, Berlin)</ref> In addition to ''Nuage articul\u00e9'', Paalen presented other objects in the 1938 surrealist exhibition, such as: ''Potence avec paratonnerre'' (Gallows with Lightning Rod), a larger-than-life wooden gibbet with lightning rods and a dedication plaque to the German philosopher and experimental physicist [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]]; ''Le moi et le soi'' (The Ego and the Id); and a version of ''Chaise envahie de lierre''. Perhaps inspired by the revolving doors used as movable walls for paintings and metaphorically called portes \u2018revolver\u2019 in the surrealist exhibition, Paalen designed a pistol shape from different small animal bones, which he fastened to a box with a tray and glass lid lined with black velvet. As in museum displays of valuable paleontological discoveries, he included its title on a copper plate inscribed \u2018Le g\u00e9nie de l'esp\u00e8ce\u2019 (The Genius, or Engineering, of the Species).\n\n===The paintings of 1938\u201339 and plans for Mexico===\n1938 he showed his new fumage paintings, which made his reputation as painter, in a show in ''Renou et Colle'' Gallery in Paris, with a catalogue text by Breton, written in [[Bermuda]] on his trip to Mexico. He published also the Lichtenberg-text ''G\u00f6ttinger Taschenalmanach'' in surrealist magazine ''[[Minotaure]]'' with illustrations by him. In 1938 the Paalens socialised with [[Frida Kahlo]] during her visit in Paris. She invited the couple to Mexico, where Paalen wanted to organize a Surrealist exhibition together with Breton.<ref>According to the correspondence with Kurt Seligmann, Paalen had the idea of organizing a great international exhibition in Mexico, see Stephan E. Hauser (1997), ''Kurt Seligmann 1900\u20131962: Leben und Werk'', Basel, p.168.</ref> It was Marcel Duchamp who recommended Paalen to Peggy Guggenheim and the New York dealer Julien Levy. \"Dear Julien, P. S. to my recent letter: Do you know Paalen\u2019s work? I suppose that you have seen some reproductions. Among the young Surr[ealists]\u2019s he ought to come out \u2013 he paints scenes \"for\" a sorcerer (you never see the witches). All this to hope that you might show him in N.Y\", Duchamp had already written to Levy in January 1939; in March he added a note about the invitation to the Guggenheim show: \u201cIn London with Mary [Reynolds] for a few days \u2013 Just came to see the last day of Paalen\u2019s show \u2013 His \u201csorcelleries\u201d look real on the walls \u2013 Hope you try them in N.Y.\"<ref>Marcel Duchamp, notes to Julien Levy, Januar/M\u00e4rz 1939, Julien Levy Gallery Records, University of Pennsylvania.</ref> After his one-man-show at the Guggenheim Jeune Gallery in Cork Street, London, as the first of the surrealists, he decided to leave Europe and travelled first to New York in May 1939 together with his wife Alice and friend [[Eva Sulzer]]. The same year he traveled through [[British Columbia]] where he collected a major totem house-screen with the representation of a bear-woman, accessible through a hole in the womb (now in the [[Denver Art Museum]]). His literary text ''Paysage tot\u00e9mique'', later published in his magazine ''DYN'', originates from the travel-notebooks, films and photographs of this voyage.<ref>Andreas Neufert has reconstructed the exact itinerary of this voyage, see \"Ten Rolls of 8mm Film Documenting Wolfgang Paalen\u00b4s Journey through British Columbia in Summer 1939\", essay, in: Dawn Ades (2011), ''The Colour of my Dreams: The Surrealist Revolution in Art'', Exhibition Catalogue, Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver, p. 229-235.</ref> In September he arrived in Mexico, where [[Diego Rivera]] and Frida Kahlo accompanied him to a house in [[Coyoac\u00e1n]], next to Kahlo's ''Casa Azul'' (The Blue House), which they had rented for him.\n\n===The first years of exile in Mexico===\n[[File:W.Paalen, Nuage articul\u00e9 II small.jpg|thumb|240px|The second version of ''[[Nuage articul\u00e9]]'', executed for the International Surrealist Exhibition in Mexico-City at the [[Galer\u00eda de Arte Mexicano]], 1940 (originally executed in 1937 for the International Surrealist Exhibition in [[Paris]], 1938)]]\nIn autumn 1939 he organized the International Surrealist Exhibition in the [[Galer\u00eda de Arte Mexicano]] together with the Peruvian poet [[C\u00e9sar Moro]], which opened in January 1940 in the [[Galer\u00eda de Arte Mexicano|new gallery rooms of Ines Amor]]. In April 1940 he showed his great Fumages and new experimental work, close to abstraction, in New York at [[Julien Levy]] gallery with great success. Reporters witness that Paalen at a certain point switched out the light and walked around with a burning candle during the opening, gathered by young American painters such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[William Baziotes]] and [[Gerome Kamrowski]].<ref>Neufert, p. 420</ref> Neither in Mexico, nor in New York he came in contact to [[Leon Trotsky]] or his assistant [[Jean van Heijenoort]] (who then was living in New York), albeit the commendatory letter, Breton had written already in Paris, hoping that Paalen would continue the contact, he had established during his trip to Mexico in 1938. Paalen justified his refusal in a letter to Breton with his general critique on the pseudo-religious paternal fixations of the Surrealists who, in his opinion, didn\u00b4t dispose of the means to find other ways out of the spiritual hole, the crisis of Marxism has left in their minds, than to look for new political fathers.<ref>see Neufert, p. 387ff., citing from the letters Paalen wrote to Breton f.e. Wolfgang Paalen to Andr\u00e9 Breton, Mai 3rd, 1940 (Biblioth\u00e8que Doucet, Paris)</ref> Back in Mexico he broke up with his former friends Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo across political opinions concerning their hard line in communism after the assassination of [[Leon Trotsky]] and their return to an open adoration of [[Joseph Stalin]]. More and more isolated from the Mexican intellectual leftists, he held an open household for European and American visitors, such as [[Roberto Matta]], Robert Motherwell, [[Gordon Onslow Ford]], [[Benjamin P\u00e9ret]], [[Remedios Varo]], [[Esteban Franc\u00e9s]] as well as refugees from the stalinist terror, like [[Gustav Regler]] and [[Victor Serge]]. He helped to organize immigration visas for the surrealists in Vichy-France through the ''Union Mexico-Francia'' and [[Julien Levy]]. During his first period of exile, Paalen concentrated on the verbalization of his ideas on art and, apart from occasional visits to New York, experimented secretly, in his studio in [[San \u00c1ngel]], in a new style on pictorial space.\n\n== The war years ==\n\n===''DYN''===\n[[File:WP DYN1.jpg|thumb|First issue of the magazine, [[Mexico]], 1942]]\nIn the spring of 1942 the New York art world witnessed the result of Paalen's intense work in the first years of exile in Mexico \u2013 the art journal ''[[DYN (journal)|DYN]]'' (derived from the Greek ''\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd'' \u2013 \"that which is possible\"). In its first issue he publicly announced to his friend Breton his ''Farewell to Surrealism''. In the second issue he scandalised his former advocate again by publishing a survey on [[Dialectical Materialism]] and an article with the provocative title ''The dialectical Gospel'', which caused a scandal among the New York Surrealists. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] then organized a symposium on dialectical materialism, with the Surrealists in Breton's apartment in New York, which revealed nothing but the inadequate knowledge of the artists on this field.<ref>see Lionel Abel: ''The Intellectual Follies. A Memoir of the Literary Venture in New York and Paris'', New York 1984, p. 89.</ref> In DYN Paalen theoretically hedged his concept of possibility on various levels, with [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], with his own concept of [[totemism]], [[gestalt psychology|gestalt]] theory, with his criticisms of dialectical materialism and western dualistic concepts, with his analysis of [[cave painting]], and so on.  By means of his journal, with a total of five issues published in Mexico between 1942 and 1944, he temporarily advanced to be one of the most influential art theorists in the wartime period. Even Breton admitted in 1944 that Paalen's criticism of Surrealism was justified and that \"we (the Surrealists) have left the whole licence to Paalen, who could say whatever he liked, without having the means to say something against or at least put something at his level. Paalen is winning on the whole line.\"<ref>Andr\u00e9 Breton in his letters to [[Benjamin P\u00e9ret]], 26 May and 31 May 1944 (Biblioth\u00e8que Doucet, Paris)</ref>\n\nIn seven large essays and countless smaller articles and reviews he discussed in detail the topical concerns of the young New York artists and, in response, received their full attention. Also his long article ''Totem Art'' had considerable influence on such artists, as [[Martha Graham]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Barnett Newman]], mainly because of the new conception of considering totemistic art as part of ecstatic action and ritual with its psychic links to generic memory and matrilinear ancestor-worship.<ref>Neufert, p. 494ff.</ref> With the exception of ''Totem Art'', all essays are republished under the title ''Form and Sense'' by [[Robert Motherwell]] in New York as the first issue of the series of writings titled ''Problems of Contemporary Art'' in which also the first papers of the later Abstract Expressionists, like ''Possibilities'', were published. Paalen's short sojourns in New York and the two solo exhibitions made him known as a painter in artist's circles, however his predominant absence from the New York art scene and the wide reception of ''DYN'' and ''Form and Sense'' fostered his image as a kind of intellectual secret agent primarily exerting indirect influence on the events through his intensely discussed ideas.\n\nIn a note with the title ''America has a new art movement (the first authentic art movement here)'' [[Barnett Newman]] listed Paalen together with Pollock, Rothko, Hoffman, Gorky, Baziotes and Motherwell as \"The men in the new art movement\"; Motherwell appears with a question mark, while Paalen is listed twice, once with the adding \"New\" (probably dividing Paalen's surrealist from his DYN-works).<ref>Barnett Newman\u00b4s notes from the years 1943-45 define also themes like \"The nature of this movement, a. The image complex, b. The problem of plastic form, c. The roots in American primitive art\", as well as \"The role of the artist\", themes, Paalen had discussed extensively in DYN. [Barnett Newman Foundation archive 18/103]</ref>\n\nThe German art historian [[Andreas Neufert]], who has extensively explored Paalen's life and work, suggested in his 2015 biography on the artist, that ''DYN'' and the New York surrealist journal ''[[VVV (magazine)|VVV]]'' were widely inspired by each other and can be seen partly as a hidden correspondence between Breton and Paalen.<ref>Neufert, see chapter ''Das DYN Projekt 1941-1944'', p. 433ff.</ref> This assumption has been already denoted (but not fully explored) by [[Yve-Alain Bois]] in 2004 in his contribution \"1942a - The depoliticization of the American avant-garde...\"<ref>in: Hal Foster, Rosalind Krauss, Yve-Alain Bois, Benjamin H.D.

There is no action, no [[metamorphosis]] in them and nothing happens with them in the space. The picture itself is the being, or a frozen resonance of it. Precisely because of this total silence, every topical expectation put to them is reflected as a question. In a cartoon published by [[Ad Reinhardt]] in the fifties, Paalen's suggestion from ''Form and Sense'' is repeated: \"Paintings no longer represent; it is no longer the task of art to answer naive questions. Today it has become the role of the painting to look at the spectator and ask him: what do you represent?\" Gustav Regler wrote 1946 about this groundbreaking idea: \n{{Cquote|There is no greater fear of the numerous escapists of our time than that before the mirror. An amazing, breathtaking idea: to have a portrait asking the original what it is worth, how it lives up to what the painter saw. The old symbol of Dorian Gray. Paalen renewed it in his way. He doubts whether anybody today even knows what he represents. He dares to pretend that someone can grow by the painter. He has the same hope as Pygmalion, to fall in love with his creation and to be outgrown by it. He waits for the picture to renounce allegiance to its creator. He paints his portrait without human features.<ref>Gustav Regler, Wolfgang Paalen, New York (Nierendorf) 1946, p. 60f.</ref>}}\nPaalen understood his ''picture beings'' as a kind of pictorial version of the ancient ''choros tragicos'', the tragic [[chorus effect]], conceived in [[Nietzsche]]'s writing on ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]].'' It is the deep existential foundation of reality, what he is interested in. Although it becomes common practice after 1947, until this time, nobody had placed so much responsibility on the viewer as Paalen did with his rhetoric and pictorial language.\n\n== After the war ==\n\n===Archeological passions===\n1946 he divorced Alice and married the [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] designer and artist [[Luchita Hurtado]], whom he had met in New York through his friend [[Isamu Noguchi]]. Hurtado moved to Mexico in 1947 to live with Paalen and together they explored the ancient culture of the [[Olmec]], about which Paalen later published a widely respected article in the French art magazine ''[[Cahiers d'art]]''.<ref>Wolfgang Paalen, ''Le plus ancien visage du Nouveau Monde'', in: Cahiers d\u2019art 27 (1952), Nr. 2</ref> Paalen radicalizes the assumption of his friend and colleague [[Miguel Covarrubias]], that the Olmecs were a culture succumbed and (after hundreds of war-years) finally wiped out by the aggressive [[Maya civilization]], comparing the Olmecs to the ancient European matrilinear civilizations, which underlay invasive and more aggressive patriarchal civilizations some 3000 years ago. Paalen's thesis about the matrilinear social-structure of the ancient societies of Mesoamerica, which he documented with considerable support from his own research, was never substantially challenged and strongly influenced such artists as [[Alice Rahon]], [[Remedios Varo]] and [[Leonora Carrington]] in their archaist and feminist themes. His ideas still live on in the archaeological and artistic discourses, the most prominent popular example of recent times being Mel Gibson's cinematic opus ''[[Apocalypto]]'').\n\n===San Francisco, Paris===\nIn 1948 one of the two children, Luchita had brought from her former marriage into the household Paalen's, died in Mexico of Polio. Paalen decided to move to San Francisco with his new family, where he worked with [[Gordon Onslow Ford]] and [[Lee Mullican]] in a newly formed association, the [[Dynaton]] group. They settled in Mill Valley and had solo shows in the San Francisco Museum of Art as well as a group show at Stanford University Art Gallery, where he also lectured parts from the major essay on his new concept of space, he had worked on the last years. It was published in occasion of the DYNATON exhibition in San Francisco Museum of Art in 1951 as a catalogue.<ref>Wolfgang Paalen, ''Metaplastic'', ''Relativity of Measure'' and ''Theory of the Dynaton'', San Francisco Museum of Art, 1951</ref> Paalen's ongoing desire to go back to Mexico and rebuilt the link to Breton in Paris led to a divorce from Luchita Paalen, who decided to live with [[Lee Mullican]]. Back in Mexico Paalen organized 1951 a longer stay in Paris. Together with his new fianc\u00e9e, the American painter Marie Wilson, Paalen lived for the next 3 years in [[Kurt Seligmann]]\u00b4s atelier-building in the Impasse Villa Seurat in Paris, built by [[Andr\u00e9 Lur\u00e7at]]. He reconciled with Breton, spent most of the summers in Breton's house in Saint Cirq La Popie, participated at the invention of various surrealist games, like ''Ouvrez-Vous?'' and ''L\u2019un dans l\u2019autre'' and painted a considerable corpus of lyrical-abstract paintings, which were exhibited at Galerie Pierre (1953) and Galerie Galanis-Hentschel (1954). One of the four numbers of Breton's magazine ''Medium - Communication Surr\u00e9aliste'' is dedicated to Paalen.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Breton, ''Wolfgang Paalen'', in: ''Medium. Communication Surr\u00e9aliste'', Nr. 1 (Oct. 1953), p. 1</ref> After travelling through Germany in the summer of 1954 he went back again to Mexico.\n\n===Last years in Mexico and suicide===\nPaalen's last years in Mexico were characterized by increasing health problems, mainly originated in his bipolar (manic-depressive) disposition. With the help of his friends and patrons [[Eva Sulzer]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.getty.edu/eva-sulzer.htm|title=PRESS RELEASE: GETTY RESEARCH INSTITUTE ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF PHOTOGRAPHS BY SWISS FILMMAKER AND PHOTOGRAPHER EVA SULZER (1902\u20131990)|last=|first=|date=September 26, 2012|website=The Getty|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref> and [[Gordon Onslow Ford]] he acquired an old house with studio in the small town [[Tepoztl\u00e1n]] in Morelos, where he mainly lived and worked during the last years of his life. Paradoxically Paalen produced a number of masterly works towards the end of this last period, as well as theatre plays and short stories, which reflect his ambivalent state of mind and growing depressions. His passion for Olmec sculpture and artefacts implicated him into adventurous expeditions into the wilderness of [[Yucat\u00e1n]], collecting and trading pre-Columbian art to an always growing US market. Rumours of Paalen having been involved in illegal looting of archaeological sites in Yucat\u00e1n inspired the American author and theologian [[Arthur A. Cohen]] to his novel ''Acts of Theft'' (1980). As expert and inspirator Wolfgang Paalen assisted the American filmmaker [[Albert Lewin]] for his film [[The Living Idol]].<ref>The Living Idol, Mexico/USA 1956, with Steve Forrest and Liliane Montevecchi</ref> 1958 he received [[Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues]] and [[Octavio Paz]] in Tepoztl\u00e1n, who both wrote texts on Paalen after his suicide.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues, ''La mort volontaire'', in: ''La Nouvelle Revue fran\u00e7aise'' (Dec. 1959), No. 84</ref><ref>Octavio Paz, ''Pr\u00e9face \u00e0 une exposition'', in: Catalogue of the memorial exhibition of Wolfgang Paalens in Librairie Loil\u00e9e, Paris 1960</ref> In the night of 25 September 1959 Paalen left his hotel room in the Hacienda San Francisco Cuadra in [[Taxco]], where he sometimes stayed during his depressions, and walked up the hill. The following day he was found dead with a gunshot to his head.<ref>Neufert (2015), p. 23, 611</ref>\n\n== Poet and writer ==\nAlthough Paalen is known chiefly as a visual artist, he also wrote poetry in [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], which he shared with [[Valentine Penrose]], [[Alice Rahon]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] and [[Paul Eluard]]. 1941 Breton reacted euphorically to Paalen's poetical diary of his voyage to [[British Columbia]] in the summer of 1939: \"I have read ''Paysage tot\u00e9mique'', re-read, read in a loud voice, nothing is more adorable, indubitably genial\".<ref>Andr\u00e9 Breton in a letter to Wolfgang Paalen, 31 July 1941 (Biblioth\u00e8que Doucet, Paris).</ref> ''Paysage tot\u00e9mique'' was partly published in his magazine ''[[DYN (journal)|DYN]]''. He also wrote three theatre plays and various unpublished stories, such as ''Der Axolotl'', ''Paloma Palomita''; his play ''The Beam of the Balance'', a tragic-comedy, reflects the unbroken power of [[Stalin]]\u00b4s totalitarian terror-regime, the release of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945 and the danger of the unbalanced scientific human mind in general. It was first read publicly in the house of [[Robert Motherwell]] in East Hampton in 1946.<ref>Amy Winter, Interview of Luchita Mullican, Santa Monica, 1 May 1994 (Archives of American Art, New York)</ref> His play ''Elorn, A Ballad from Brittany'' reflects his lifelong passion with pre-Celtic matrilinear cultures.\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe complete works of Paalen, canvases, objects and sculptures, were catalogued by art historian [[Andreas Neufert]] in his 1999 book ''Wolfgang Paalen: Im Inneren des Wals: Monography, and Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9''.<ref>Paalen, W. (1999), ''Wolfgang Paalen: Im Inneren des Wals: Monography, and Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9'', Vienna/New York: [[Springer Science+Business Media]].</ref> Paalen's estate in Mexico, including papers and photographs, was donated by the heirs of Isabel Marin de Paalen to the [[Franz Mayer Museum]] in Mexico City. The estate which Paalen left in the care of his close friend, the surrealist painter [[Gordon Onslow Ford]], is administrated by the Lucid Art Foundation in [[Inverness, California]], which recently restituted Paalen's rich archive of papers, photographs and manuscripts to the heirs of [[Eva Sulzer]], Paalen's only heir and executor.<ref>The ''Succession Wolfgang Paalen et Eva Sulzer'' is administrated by their fiduciary Andreas Neufert who also deals with all questions of copyright.</ref>\n\nBetween May and July 2007 a collection of his work was exhibited at the Frey Norris gallery in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surrealismcentre.ac.uk/papersofsurrealism/journal6/acrobat%20files/articles/merjianpdf.pdf|title=Wolfgang Paalen: Implicit Spaces.

Only minor works appear from time to time in public auctions, as most of the major works are in museums or well-established private collections. In 2009 however, [[Christie's]] auctioned Paalen's important 1938 surrealist fumage painting ''Paysage (Pays) m\u00e9dus\u00e9'' (oil and smoke on canvas).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/wolfgang-paalen-pays-meduse-5268285-details.aspx?from=searchresults&intObjectID=5268285&sid=a5dd5722-d54d-478e-9b29-63254d0e5b1f|title=Wolfgang Paalen (1905\u20131959)|author=|publisher=[[Christie's]]|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> Estimated at US$40\u201350,000, the realised price was US$561,000, setting a new record for the highest price paid at auction for this artist.\n\n== Artworks ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* ''Personnages dans une grotte'', 1933\n* ''Hommes possibles'' 1934\n* ''Avertissement'' 1935\n* ''L\u00b4heure exacte'' object, 1936\n* ''Pays interdit'' 1936\u201337\n* ''Rencontre sur une plage'', 1936 \n* ''L'Homme possible'', 1936\n* ''Toison d'or'', 1937\n* ''La Balance'', 1937\n* ''Le D\u00e9barcad\u00e8re'', 1937\n* ''Paysage tot\u00e9mique de mon enfance'', 1937\n* ''[[Nuage articul\u00e9]] I'', objet, 1937 \n* ''Paysage tot\u00e9mique'', 1937\n* ''Fata Alaska'', 1937\n* ''Les \u00c9trangers'', 1937\n* ''La Housse'' Mannequin 1938\n* ''Autophage'', 1938\n* ''Orages magn\u00e9tiques'', 1938\n* ''Combat des princes saturniens'' I and II, 1938\n* ''Vol de moustiques'', 1938\n* ''Paysage m\u00e9dus\u00e9'', 1938\n* ''Les Guetteurs'', 1938\n* ''Ciel de pieuvre'', 1938\n* ''Taches solaires'', 1938\n* ''Plumages'', 1938\n* ''Le genie de l\u00b4esp\u00e8ce'' (object, 1938)\n* ''Combats des princes saturniens, III'', 1939 \n* ''[[Nuage articul\u00e9]] II'' (object, 1940)\n* ''Polarit\u00e9s chromatiques'', 1940\n* ''Espace sans limite'', 1941\n* ''Les premieres spaciales'' tryptich, 1941\u201344\n* ''Les Cosmogonies'', 1943\n* ''La Temp\u00eate'', 1945\n* ''Gyra'', 1945\n* ''L'Or du temps'', 1945\n* ''Selam Trilogy'', 1947\n* ''Hamnur Trilogy'', 1947\n* ''Nuit tropicale'', 1947\n* ''Anc\u00eatres \u00e0 venir'', 1949\n* ''Messagers'', 1949\n* ''F\u00eate mexicaine'', 1949\n* ''Le Messager des trois P\u00f4les'', 1949\n* ''La Cl\u00e9 de Duchamp'', Hommage \u00e0 Marcel Duchamp, 1950\n* ''L'enclume'', 1952\n* ''Sur les hauts plateaux'', 1952\n* ''Lumi\u00e8re fossile'', 1953\n* ''Le Scarab\u00e9e d'or'', 1953\n* ''B\u00e9atrice perdue'', 1953\n* ''Banistas'' (1958)\n* ''Asi es la vida'', 1958\n* ''Isla Mujeres'', 1958\n* ''Matutine'', 1959\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Essays in DYN ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n\n===In English===\n*\"The New Image\", No. 1, April\u2013May 1942\n*''Suggestion for an Objective Morality, in: Dyn, n\u00b0 1, April\u2013May 1942    \n*''Seeing and Showing, in: Dyn, n\u00b0 1, April\u2013May 1942\n*''Surprise and Inspiration', in: Dyn, n\u00b0 1, April\u2013May 1942\n*''About the Origins of the Doric Column and the Guitar-woman, in: Dyn, n\u00b0 2, July\u2013August 1942\n*''The Dialectical Gospel, in: Dyn, n\u00b0 2, July\u2013August 1942\n*''Art and Science, in: Dyn, n\u00b0 3, autumn 1942\n*''Book-Reviews\n*''Totem Art, in: Dyn, n\u00b0 4-5, 1943\n*''Birth of Fire, in: Dyn, n\u00b0 4-5, 1943\n*''On the Meaning of Cubism Today, in: Dyn, n\u00b0 6, November 1944\n\n===In French===\n*\"Farewell au surr\u00e9alisme\", No. 1, April\u2013May 1942\n*''L'Image nouvelle'', in: Dyn, n\u00b0 1, April\u2013May 1942\n*''Aper\u00e7u pour une morale objective'', in: Dyn, n\u00b0 1, April\u2013May 1942\n*''Paysage tot\u00e9mique'' (3 articles), in: Dyn, n\u00b0 1, April\u2013May 1942, n\u00b0 2, July\u2013August 1942, n\u00b0 3, autumn 1942 \n*''Surprise et inspiration'', in: Dyn, n\u00b0 2, July\u2013August 1942\n*''L'\u00c9vangile dialectique'', in: DYN, n\u00b0 3, autumn 1942\n*''Le Grand Malentendu'' (trad. of ''Art and Science''), in: DYN, n\u00b0 3, autumn 1942\n*''Rencontre tot\u00e9mique'' in: DYN, n\u00b0 4-5, 1943\n*''Actualit\u00e9 du cubisme'', in: Dyn, n\u00b0 6, November 1944\n*''Pendant l'\u00e9clipse'', interview of Paalen with Carter Stone, in: Dyn, n\u00b0 6, November 1944\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n\n===Selected biographies===\n*[[Andreas Neufert]] (2014), ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'' (Biography), Berlin: Parthas Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3869640839}}.
