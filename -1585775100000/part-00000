The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a [[monsoon]] season. However, the monsoons, though substantial in Agra, are not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of India. This is a primary factor in Agra featuring a semiarid climate as opposed to a [[humid subtropical climate]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Agra, India\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 29\n|Feb record high C = 35.6\n|Mar record high C = 42.8\n|Apr record high C = 46.5\n|May record high C = 48.6\n|Jun record high C = 48.5\n|Jul record high C = 46.5\n|Aug record high C = 43.0\n|Sep record high C = 41.4\n|Oct record high C = 41.1\n|Nov record high C = 36.1\n|Dec record high C = 31.0\n|year record high C = 48.6\n|Jan high C = 22.3\n|Feb high C = 25.2\n|Mar high C = 32.0\n|Apr high C = 38.5\n|May high C = 41.6\n|Jun high C = 40.7\n|Jul high C = 35.2\n|Aug high C = 33.7\n|Sep high C = 34.4\n|Oct high C = 34.3\n|Nov high C = 29.7\n|Dec high C = 24.0\n|year high C = 32.6\n|Jan mean C = 15.1\n|Feb mean C = 17.8\n|Mar mean C = 24.0\n|Apr mean C = 30.5\n|May mean C = 34.0\n|Jun mean C = 34.6\n|Jul mean C = 31.1\n|Aug mean C = 29.6\n|Sep mean C = 29.4\n|Oct mean C = 27.0\n|Nov mean C = 21.7\n|Dec mean C = 16.6\n|year mean C = 26.0\n|Jan low C = 8.0\n|Feb low C = 10.4\n|Mar low C = 15.9\n|Apr low C = 22.3\n|May low C = 26.4\n|Jun low C = 28.5\n|Jul low C = 26.8\n|Aug low C = 25.8\n|Sep low C = 24.4\n|Oct low C = 19.9\n|Nov low C = 13.7\n|Dec low C = 9.1\n|year low C = 19.3\n|Jan record low C = -2.2\n|Feb record low C = -1.7\n|Mar record low C = 5.6\n|Apr record low C = 10.0\n|May record low C = 14.0\n|Jun record low C = 12.0\n|Jul record low C = 14.5\n|Aug record low C = 12.0\n|Sep record low C = 13.0\n|Oct record low C = 9.4\n|Nov record low C = 2.8\n|Dec record low C = -0.6\n|year record low C = -2.2\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 13.2\n|Feb rain mm = 17.6\n|Mar rain mm = 9.3\n|Apr rain mm = 6.3\n|May rain mm = 11.3\n|Jun rain mm = 55.7\n|Jul rain mm = 203.3\n|Aug rain mm = 243.2\n|Sep rain mm = 129.7\n|Oct rain mm = 24.8\n|Nov rain mm = 4.3\n|Dec rain mm = 6.1\n|year rain mm = \n|unit rain days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan rain days = 1.6\n|Feb rain days = 1.5\n|Mar rain days = 1.6\n|Apr rain days = 1.1\n|May rain days = 2.0\n|Jun rain days = 4.7\n|Jul rain days = 13.6\n|Aug rain days = 13.7\n|Sep rain days = 6.5\n|Oct rain days = 1.5\n|Nov rain days = 0.6\n|Dec rain days = 0.8\n|year rain days = 49.2\n|Jan humidity = 64\n|Feb humidity = 55\n|Mar humidity = 45\n|Apr humidity = 35\n|May humidity = 34\n|Jun humidity = 46\n|Jul humidity = 72\n|Aug humidity = 77\n|Sep humidity = 67\n|Oct humidity = 54\n|Nov humidity = 56\n|Dec humidity = 64\n|year humidity = 56\n|source 1 = NOAA (1971\u20131990),<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_II/IN/42261.TXT\n| title = Agra Climate Normals 1971\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 18 January 2014}}</ref> [[World Meteorological Organization]] (precipitation 1901\u20132000)<ref name= WMO>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://worldweather.wmo.int/066/c01561.htm\n| title = World Weather Information Service\u2013Agra\n| publisher = World Meteorological Organization\n| accessdate = 18 January 2014\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140109065849/http://worldweather.wmo.int/066/c01561.htm\n| archive-date = 9 January 2014\n| url-status = live\n| df = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n|source 2 = India Meteorological Department (records)<ref name=IMD>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.imdpune.gov.in/Temp_Extremes/histext2010.pdf \n |title=Ever recorded Maximum and minimum temperatures up to 2010 \n |publisher=India Meteorological Department \n |accessdate=18 January 2014 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GmnoaB0m?url=http://www.imdpune.gov.in/Temp_Extremes/histext2010.pdf \n |archivedate=21 May 2013 \n}}</ref>\n|date = December 2010}}\n\n== Population ==\n\n=== Demographics ===\n{{see also|List of cities in Uttar Pradesh}}\n{{As of|2011}} India census,<ref name=population/><ref name=\"AGR\"/> Agra city has a population of 1,585,704, while the population of Agra cantonment is 53,053.

Akbar made it the eponymous seat of one of his original twelve [[subah]]s (imperial top-level provinces), bordering (Old) Delhi, Awadh (Oudh), Allahabad, Malwa and Ajmer subahs. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted his capital to [[Shahjahanabad|Sh\u0101hjah\u0101nab\u0101d]] in the year 1648.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Richards |first1=John F. |title=The Mughal Empire |date=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521566032 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA119 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nSince Akbarab\u0101d was one of the most important cities in India under the [[Mughals]], it witnessed a lot of building activity. Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, laid out the first formal Persian garden on the banks of the river [[Yamuna]]. The garden is called the Ar\u0101m B\u0101gh or the Garden of Relaxation. His grandson [[Akbar the Great]] raised the towering ramparts of the Great Red Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarab\u0101d called [[Fatehpur Sikri]]. This city was built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.\n\n[[File:Kos Minar 793.jpg|thumb|[[Kos Minar]] #793 at 12 mile on Agra-[[Fatehpur Sikri]] Road section of [[National Highway 21 (India)|National Highway 21]]]]\nHis son Jah\u0101ng\u012br had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort or L\u0101l Qil'a. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Akbarab\u0101d its most prized monument, the [[Taj Mahal]]. Built in loving memory of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]], the mausoleum was completed in 1653.\n\nSh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted the capital to [[Delhi]] during his reign, but his son [[Aurangzeb]] moved the capital back to Akbarab\u0101d, usurping his father and imprisoning him in the Fort there.\n\n=== Later periods ===\n\nThe [[Hindu Jats|Jat]] kingdom of [[Bharatpur State|Bharatpur]] waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra.<ref name=\"Unit1973\">{{cite book | title=The Gazetteer of India: History and culture | year=1973 | publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, India | oclc = 186583361 | page = 348 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of [[Marathas]] and was called Agra, before falling into the hands of the [[British Raj]] in 1803.\n\n[[File:Agra, Main Street, c.1858.jpg|right|thumb|Agra, Main Street, c. 1858]]\n[[File:Agra (Baedeker, 1914).jpg|left|thumb|Map of the city, c. 1914]]\nIn 1835 when the [[Presidency of Agra]] was established by the British, the city became the seat of government, and just two years later it was witness to the [[Agra famine of 1837\u201338]]. During the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] British rule across India was threatened, news of the rebellion had reached Agra on 11 May and on 30 May two companies of native infantry, the 44th and 67th regiments, rebelled and marched to [[Delhi]]. The next morning native Indian troops in Agra were forced to disarm, on 15 June [[Gwalior]] (which lies south of Agra) rebelled. By 3 July, the British were forced to withdraw into the fort. Two days later a small British force at Sucheta were defeated and forced to withdraw, this led to a mob sacking the city. However, the rebels moved onto Delhi which allowed the British to restore order by 8 July. Delhi fell to the British in September, the following month rebels who had fled Delhi along with rebels from Central India marched on Agra but were defeated. After this British rule was again secured over the city until the independence of India in 1947.<ref name='Digital South Asia Library of University of Chicago'>{{cite journal|title=Agra City|journal=Imperial Gazetteer of India (Digital South Asia Library of University of Chicago)|volume=5|pages=83\u201384|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_091.gif|format=GIF|accessdate=8 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522172131/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_091.gif|archive-date=22 May 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Legacies ===\nAgra is the birthplace of the religion known as [[Din-i-Ilahi|D\u012bn-i Il\u0101h\u012b]], which flourished during the reign of [[Akbar]] and also of the [[Radha Swami|Radhaswami Faith]], which has around two million followers worldwide.

Finished in marble, it is one of India's many beautiful monuments and is set amidst landscaped gardens. Built by the Persian architect, Ust\u0101d '\u012as\u0101, the Taj Mahal is on the south bank of the [[Yamuna]] River. It can be observed from [[Agra Fort]] from where Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n gazed at it for the last eight years of his life, a prisoner of his son [[Aurangzeb]]. Verses of the [[Quran]] are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are 22 small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Taj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant dome of the Taj Mahal has a diameter of {{convert|60|ft|m}}, and rises to a height of {{convert|80|ft|m}}; directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal.

A stone tablet at the gate of the Fort states that it had been built before 1000 but was later renovated by Akbar. The red sandstone fort was converted into a palace during [[Shah Jahan|Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n]]'s time, and reworked extensively with [[marble]] and [[pietra dura]] inlay.

In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. An insulted Sh\u012bvaj\u012b stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666. Fearing the dungeons and execution he escaped on 17 August 1666.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe fort is a typical example of Mughal architecture, effectively showing how the North Indian style of fort construction differed from that of the South.

It lies about {{convert|2.34|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the Taj Mahal. The pavilions in this garden are designed so that the wind from the Yamuna, combined with the greenery, keeps them cool even during the peak of summer. The original name of the gardens was \u0100r\u0101m B\u0101gh, or 'Garden of Relaxation', and this was where the Mughal emperor B\u0101bar used to spend his leisure time and where he eventually died.

This is a primary factor in Agra featuring a semiarid climate as opposed to a [[humid subtropical climate]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Agra, India\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 29\n|Feb record high C = 35.6\n|Mar record high C = 42.8\n|Apr record high C = 46.5\n|May record high C = 48.6\n|Jun record high C = 48.5\n|Jul record high C = 46.5\n|Aug record high C = 43.0\n|Sep record high C = 41.4\n|Oct record high C = 41.1\n|Nov record high C = 36.1\n|Dec record high C = 31.0\n|year record high C = 48.6\n|Jan high C = 22.3\n|Feb high C = 25.2\n|Mar high C = 32.0\n|Apr high C = 38.5\n|May high C = 41.6\n|Jun high C = 40.7\n|Jul high C = 35.2\n|Aug high C = 33.7\n|Sep high C = 34.4\n|Oct high C = 34.3\n|Nov high C = 29.7\n|Dec high C = 24.0\n|year high C = 32.6\n|Jan mean C = 15.1\n|Feb mean C = 17.8\n|Mar mean C = 24.0\n|Apr mean C = 30.5\n|May mean C = 34.0\n|Jun mean C = 34.6\n|Jul mean C = 31.1\n|Aug mean C = 29.6\n|Sep mean C = 29.4\n|Oct mean C = 27.0\n|Nov mean C = 21.7\n|Dec mean C = 16.6\n|year mean C = 26.0\n|Jan low C = 8.0\n|Feb low C = 10.4\n|Mar low C = 15.9\n|Apr low C = 22.3\n|May low C = 26.4\n|Jun low C = 28.5\n|Jul low C = 26.8\n|Aug low C = 25.8\n|Sep low C = 24.4\n|Oct low C = 19.9\n|Nov low C = 13.7\n|Dec low C = 9.1\n|year low C = 19.3\n|Jan record low C = -2.2\n|Feb record low C = -1.7\n|Mar record low C = 5.6\n|Apr record low C = 10.0\n|May record low C = 14.0\n|Jun record low C = 12.0\n|Jul record low C = 14.5\n|Aug record low C = 12.0\n|Sep record low C = 13.0\n|Oct record low C = 9.4\n|Nov record low C = 2.8\n|Dec record low C = -0.6\n|year record low C = -2.2\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 13.2\n|Feb rain mm = 17.6\n|Mar rain mm = 9.3\n|Apr rain mm = 6.3\n|May rain mm = 11.3\n|Jun rain mm = 55.7\n|Jul rain mm = 203.3\n|Aug rain mm = 243.2\n|Sep rain mm = 129.7\n|Oct rain mm = 24.8\n|Nov rain mm = 4.3\n|Dec rain mm = 6.1\n|year rain mm = \n|unit rain days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan rain days = 1.6\n|Feb rain days = 1.5\n|Mar rain days = 1.6\n|Apr rain days = 1.1\n|May rain days = 2.0\n|Jun rain days = 4.7\n|Jul rain days = 13.6\n|Aug rain days = 13.7\n|Sep rain days = 6.5\n|Oct rain days = 1.5\n|Nov rain days = 0.6\n|Dec rain days = 0.8\n|year rain days = 49.2\n|Jan humidity = 64\n|Feb humidity = 55\n|Mar humidity = 45\n|Apr humidity = 35\n|May humidity = 34\n|Jun humidity = 46\n|Jul humidity = 72\n|Aug humidity = 77\n|Sep humidity = 67\n|Oct humidity = 54\n|Nov humidity = 56\n|Dec humidity = 64\n|year humidity = 56\n|source 1 = NOAA (1971\u20131990),<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_II/IN/42261.TXT\n| title = Agra Climate Normals 1971\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 18 January 2014}}</ref> [[World Meteorological Organization]] (precipitation 1901\u20132000)<ref name= WMO>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://worldweather.wmo.int/066/c01561.htm\n| title = World Weather Information Service\u2013Agra\n| publisher = World Meteorological Organization\n| accessdate = 18 January 2014\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140109065849/http://worldweather.wmo.int/066/c01561.htm\n| archive-date = 9 January 2014\n| url-status = live\n| df = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n|source 2 = India Meteorological Department (records)<ref name=IMD>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.imdpune.gov.in/Temp_Extremes/histext2010.pdf \n |title=Ever recorded Maximum and minimum temperatures up to 2010 \n |publisher=India Meteorological Department \n |accessdate=18 January 2014 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GmnoaB0m?url=http://www.imdpune.gov.in/Temp_Extremes/histext2010.pdf \n |archivedate=21 May 2013 \n}}</ref>\n|date = December 2010}}\n\n== Population ==\n\n=== Demographics ===\n{{see also|List of cities in Uttar Pradesh}}\n{{As of|2011}} India census,<ref name=population/><ref name=\"AGR\"/> Agra city has a population of 1,585,704, while the population of Agra cantonment is 53,053.

Akbar made it the eponymous seat of one of his original twelve [[subah]]s (imperial top-level provinces), bordering (Old) Delhi, Awadh (Oudh), Allahabad, Malwa and Ajmer subahs. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted his capital to [[Shahjahanabad|Sh\u0101hjah\u0101nab\u0101d]] in the year 1648.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Richards |first1=John F. |title=The Mughal Empire |date=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521566032 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA119 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nSince Akbarab\u0101d was one of the most important cities in India under the [[Mughals]], it witnessed a lot of building activity. Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, laid out the first formal Persian garden on the banks of the river [[Yamuna]]. The garden is called the Ar\u0101m B\u0101gh or the Garden of Relaxation. His grandson [[Akbar the Great]] raised the towering ramparts of the Great Red Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarab\u0101d called [[Fatehpur Sikri]]. This city was built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.\n\n[[File:Kos Minar 793.jpg|thumb|[[Kos Minar]] #793 at 12 mile on Agra-[[Fatehpur Sikri]] Road section of [[National Highway 21 (India)|National Highway 21]]]]\nHis son Jah\u0101ng\u012br had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort or L\u0101l Qil'a. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Akbarab\u0101d its most prized monument, the [[Taj Mahal]]. Built in loving memory of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]], the mausoleum was completed in 1653.\n\nSh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted the capital to [[Delhi]] during his reign, but his son [[Aurangzeb]] moved the capital back to Akbarab\u0101d, usurping his father and imprisoning him in the Fort there.\n\n=== Later periods ===\n\nThe [[Hindu Jats|Jat]] kingdom of [[Bharatpur State|Bharatpur]] waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra.<ref name=\"Unit1973\">{{cite book | title=The Gazetteer of India: History and culture | year=1973 | publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, India | oclc = 186583361 | page = 348 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of [[Marathas]] and was called Agra, before falling into the hands of the [[British Raj]] in 1803.\n\n[[File:Agra, Main Street, c.1858.jpg|right|thumb|Agra, Main Street, c. 1858]]\n[[File:Agra (Baedeker, 1914).jpg|left|thumb|Map of the city, c. 1914]]\nIn 1835 when the [[Presidency of Agra]] was established by the British, the city became the seat of government, and just two years later it was witness to the [[Agra famine of 1837\u201338]]. During the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] British rule across India was threatened, news of the rebellion had reached Agra on 11 May and on 30 May two companies of native infantry, the 44th and 67th regiments, rebelled and marched to [[Delhi]]. The next morning native Indian troops in Agra were forced to disarm, on 15 June [[Gwalior]] (which lies south of Agra) rebelled. By 3 July, the British were forced to withdraw into the fort. Two days later a small British force at Sucheta were defeated and forced to withdraw, this led to a mob sacking the city. However, the rebels moved onto Delhi which allowed the British to restore order by 8 July. Delhi fell to the British in September, the following month rebels who had fled Delhi along with rebels from Central India marched on Agra but were defeated. After this British rule was again secured over the city until the independence of India in 1947.<ref name='Digital South Asia Library of University of Chicago'>{{cite journal|title=Agra City|journal=Imperial Gazetteer of India (Digital South Asia Library of University of Chicago)|volume=5|pages=83\u201384|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_091.gif|format=GIF|accessdate=8 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522172131/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_091.gif|archive-date=22 May 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Legacies ===\nAgra is the birthplace of the religion known as [[Din-i-Ilahi|D\u012bn-i Il\u0101h\u012b]], which flourished during the reign of [[Akbar]] and also of the [[Radha Swami|Radhaswami Faith]], which has around two million followers worldwide.

Finished in marble, it is one of India's many beautiful monuments and is set amidst landscaped gardens. Built by the Persian architect, Ust\u0101d '\u012as\u0101, the Taj Mahal is on the south bank of the [[Yamuna]] River. It can be observed from [[Agra Fort]] from where Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n gazed at it for the last eight years of his life, a prisoner of his son [[Aurangzeb]]. Verses of the [[Quran]] are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are 22 small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Taj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant dome of the Taj Mahal has a diameter of {{convert|60|ft|m}}, and rises to a height of {{convert|80|ft|m}}; directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal.

A stone tablet at the gate of the Fort states that it had been built before 1000 but was later renovated by Akbar. The red sandstone fort was converted into a palace during [[Shah Jahan|Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n]]'s time, and reworked extensively with [[marble]] and [[pietra dura]] inlay.

In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. An insulted Sh\u012bvaj\u012b stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666. Fearing the dungeons and execution he escaped on 17 August 1666.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe fort is a typical example of Mughal architecture, effectively showing how the North Indian style of fort construction differed from that of the South.

It lies about {{convert|2.34|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the Taj Mahal. The pavilions in this garden are designed so that the wind from the Yamuna, combined with the greenery, keeps them cool even during the peak of summer. The original name of the gardens was \u0100r\u0101m B\u0101gh, or 'Garden of Relaxation', and this was where the Mughal emperor B\u0101bar used to spend his leisure time and where he eventually died.

Black slaves were attendants to sea captains and ex-colonial officials as well as traders, plantation owners and military personnel. This marked growing evidence of the black presence in the northern, eastern and southern areas of London. There were also small numbers of free slaves and seaman from West Africa and South Asia.

In 1764 The Gentleman's Magazine reported that there was 'supposed to be near 20,000 Negroe servants'  -Evidence of the number of black residents in London has been found through registered burials. The people of London had widespread views that Black people in London were less than human;  {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} these views were expressed in slave sale advertisements. Leading black activists of this era included [[Olaudah Equiano]], [[Ignatius Sancho]] and [[Quobna Ottobah Cugoano]].\nWith the support of other Britons these activists demanded that Blacks be freed from slavery.  Supporters involved in this movements included workers and other nationalities of the urban poor<!-- commented out because non-neutral point of view: who themselves suffered under the rule of the upper class -->. <!--commented out: was the slave trade widely carried on in Britain?

Free black slaves could not be enslaved, but blacks who were brought as slaves to Britain were considered the property of their owners.\nDuring this era [[Lord Mansfield]] declared that a slave who fled from his master could not be taken by force or sold abroad, in the case of [[Somerset v Stewart]].  This verdict fuelled the numbers of Blacks that escaped slavery, and helped send slavery into decline.  In this same period many slave soldiers who fought on the side of the British in the [[American Revolutionary War]] arrived in London.  These soldiers were deprived of pensions and many of them became poverty-stricken and were reduced to begging on the streets.  The Blacks in London lived among the whites in areas of [[Mile End]], [[Stepney]], [[Paddington]] and [[St Giles, London|St Giles]]. The majority of these people did not live as slaves, but as servants to wealthy whites. Many became labeled as the \"Black Poor\" defined as former low wage soldiers, seafarers and plantation workers.<ref name=\"FilePower\">{{cite book|last=File|first=Nigel|first2=Chris|last2=Power|date=1981|title=Black Settlers in Britain 1555\u20131958|publisher=Heinnemann Educational|isbn=978-0435311735}}</ref>\n\nDuring the late 18th century there were many publications and memoirs written about the \"black poor\".  One example is the writings of Equiano, who became an unofficial spokesman for Britain's Black community.  A memoir about his life is entitled, ''[[The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano]]''. Equiano became a landowner in Cambridgeshire and married Susannah Cullen, from [[Soham]]. Both his daughters were born and baptised there.\n\nIn 1787 4,000 blacks were transported from London for resettlement to the colony of Sierra Leone with help from the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor.<ref>http://www.betterworldbooks.com/african-americans-in-the-american-revolution-id-1155512723.aspx</ref>\n\n== 19th century ==\n\nComing into the early 19th century, more groups of black soldiers and seaman were displaced after the [[Napoleonic wars]] and some settled in London.  These settlers suffered and faced many challenges as did many black people in London.  <!-- (commented out: see [[Atlantic slave trade#Economics of slavery]] for debates about this.)

The number of blacks in London was steadily declining with these new laws.  Fewer blacks were brought into London from the West Indies and parts of Africa.<ref name=\"FilePower\" />\n\nDuring the mid-19th century there were restrictions on African immigration.  In the later part of the 19th century there was a buildup of small groups of black dockside communities in towns such as [[Canning Town]],<ref>Geoffrey Bell, ''The other Eastenders : Kamal Chunchie and West Ham's early black community'' (Stratford: Eastside Community Heritage, 2002)</ref> [[Liverpool]], and [[Cardiff]].  This was a direct effect of new shipping links that were established with the Caribbean and West Africa.\n\nDespite social prejudice and  racist discrimination in Victorian England, some nineteenth-century black people living in England achieved exceptional success. [[Pablo Fanque]], born poor as William Darby in Norwich, rose to become the proprietor of one of Britain's most successful Victorian circuses. He is immortalised in the lyrics of The Beatles song \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" Another famous black Briton was [[William Davidson (conspirator)|William Davison]], a conspirator executed in London for his role in the Cato Street Conspiracy against Lord Liverpool's government in 1820. Britain's first black [[High Sheriff]] was [[Nathaniel Wells]], the son of a slave from [[St Kitts]] and a slave trader. After his father's death he was freed and inherited a fortune. He moved to Monmouthshire's [[Piercefield House]] and became [[Sheriff of Monmouthshire]] in 1818. One of the leaders in 19th century [[chartism]] was [[William Cuffay]], who was born on a merchant ship in the West Indies in 1788, and whose father, had been a slave in St Kitts.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC|work=History|title=William Cuffay (1788 - 1870)|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/cuffay_william.shtml}}</ref>\n\n==20th century==\n\nOne of the black Londoners, [[Learie Constantine]], a cricketer from Trinidad and  welfare officer in the [[RAF]], was refused service at a London hotel.

There were an estimated 492 that were passengers on the {{HMT|Empire Windrush}} that arrived at [[Tilbury Docks]] on 22 June 1948. These passengers settled in the area of [[Brixton]] which is now a prominently Black district in Britain. From the 1950s into the 1960s, there was a mass migration of workers from all over the English-speaking Caribbean, particularly [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]]; who settled in the UK. These immigrants were invited to fill labour requirements in London's hospitals, transportation venues and railway development. There was a continuous influx of African students, sportsmen, and businessmen mixed within British society .<ref>{{Cite web|title = Black British timeline {{!}} Black London {{!}} Black British History|url = http://www.blackpresence.co.uk/black-british-timeline/|website = The Black Presence in Britain|access-date = 2016-02-14|language = en-GB}}</ref>  They are widely viewed as having been a major contributing factor to the rebuilding of the post-war urban London economy.\n\nIn 1962, the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962|Commonwealth Immigrants Act]] was passed in the UK along with a succession of other laws in [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968|1968]], [[Immigration Act 1971|1971]], and [[British Nationality Act 1981|1981]] that severely restricted the entry of Black Caribbean immigrants into the United Kingdom. During this period, it is widely argued that emergent Blacks and Asians struggled in Britain against racism and prejudice. In 1975, a new voice emerged for the Black population of London; his name was [[David Pitt, Baron Pitt of Hampstead|David Pitt]] and he brought a new voice to the [[House of Lords]]. He spoke against racism and for equality in regards to all residents of Britain. At the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], the first-ever [[Black British]] MPs were elected to the [[House of Commons]]; [[Diane Abbott]] for [[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney North and Stoke Newington]], [[Bernie Grant]] for [[Tottenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Tottenham]] and [[Paul Boateng]] for [[Brent South (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent South]]. All were candidates from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and out of these three people; Abbott holds the distinction of being the first Black British woman to be elected to the House of Commons and is also the only one to still be an MP to the present day, as Grant died in 2000 and Boateng stood down in [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]].\n\nBy the end of the twentieth century, the number of Black Londoners numbered half a million, according to the [[United Kingdom Census 1991|1991 UK Census]]. An increasing number of these Black Londoners were London, or British-born. Even with this growing population and the first Blacks elected to the UK Parliament, many argue that there was still discrimination and a socio-economic imbalance in London among the Black community. In [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]], the number of Blacks in Parliament increased to six and in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]], they increased their numbers to nine. There are still many problems that Black Londoners face; the new global and high-tech information revolution is changing the urban economy and some argue that it is driving unemployment rates among Blacks up relative to non-blacks,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} something which, it is argued, threatens to erode the progress made thus far.<ref name=\"FilePower\" />\n\nAs of June 2007, the Black population of London is 802,300, equivalent to 10.6% of the population of London. 4.3% of Londoners are Caribbean, 5.5% of Londoners are African and a further 0.8% are from other black backgrounds including American and Latin American.

There was a continuous influx of African students, sportsmen, and businessmen mixed within British society .<ref>{{Cite web|title = Black British timeline {{!}} Black London {{!}} Black British History|url = http://www.blackpresence.co.uk/black-british-timeline/|website = The Black Presence in Britain|access-date = 2016-02-14|language = en-GB}}</ref>  They are widely viewed as having been a major contributing factor to the rebuilding of the post-war urban London economy.\n\nIn 1962, the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962|Commonwealth Immigrants Act]] was passed in the UK along with a succession of other laws in [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968|1968]], [[Immigration Act 1971|1971]], and [[British Nationality Act 1981|1981]] that severely restricted the entry of Black Caribbean immigrants into the United Kingdom. During this period, it is widely argued that emergent Blacks and Asians struggled in Britain against racism and prejudice. In 1975, a new voice emerged for the Black population of London; his name was [[David Pitt, Baron Pitt of Hampstead|David Pitt]] and he brought a new voice to the [[House of Lords]]. He spoke against racism and for equality in regards to all residents of Britain. At the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], the first-ever [[Black British]] MPs were elected to the [[House of Commons]]; [[Diane Abbott]] for [[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney North and Stoke Newington]], [[Bernie Grant]] for [[Tottenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Tottenham]] and [[Paul Boateng]] for [[Brent South (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent South]]. All were candidates from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and out of these three people; Abbott holds the distinction of being the first Black British woman to be elected to the House of Commons and is also the only one to still be an MP to the present day, as Grant died in 2000 and Boateng stood down in [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]].\n\nBy the end of the twentieth century, the number of Black Londoners numbered half a million, according to the [[United Kingdom Census 1991|1991 UK Census]]. An increasing number of these Black Londoners were London, or British-born. Even with this growing population and the first Blacks elected to the UK Parliament, many argue that there was still discrimination and a socio-economic imbalance in London among the Black community. In [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]], the number of Blacks in Parliament increased to six and in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]], they increased their numbers to nine. There are still many problems that Black Londoners face; the new global and high-tech information revolution is changing the urban economy and some argue that it is driving unemployment rates among Blacks up relative to non-blacks,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} something which, it is argued, threatens to erode the progress made thus far.<ref name=\"FilePower\" />\n\nAs of June 2007, the Black population of London is 802,300, equivalent to 10.6% of the population of London. 4.3% of Londoners are Caribbean, 5.5% of Londoners are African and a further 0.8% are from other black backgrounds including American and Latin American.

African Americans have traditionally been composed only a small part of the total population in Utah, with the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] placing the percentage of African Americans at 1.06%.

After 1870, the majority of African American immigrants were immigrating for non-religious reasons.<ref name=\":2\" /> Despite this growth, the proportion of African Americans in Utah remained consistently low. One major reason for this trend was the [[Black people and Mormonism|lack of full acceptance of African Americans in the Latter-day Saint church]] (which lasted until [[1978 Revelation on Priesthood|1978]]), which resulted in a low incentive for African American converts and minimal [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary effort]] focused on [[Africa]]n countries.\n\n=== Industry ===\nThe [[United States Armed Forces|United States Military]] and the arrival of the railroads in Utah were perhaps the two biggest pull factors and employers for African Americans in this time period.

There was a slight decline in economic activity shortly after World War I with [[J.R. Booth]]'s construction of a rival town, [[Depot Harbour, Ontario|Depot Harbour]] on nearby [[Parry Island, Ontario|Parry Island]], but this setback was overcome through later developments in tourism and commerce, and the accidental destruction by fire of the entire town of Depot Harbour on August 14, 1945.\n\nThe body of water that gives the town its name was surveyed and named by Captain [[Henry Bayfield]] in the 19th century, in honour of the Arctic explorer Sir [[William Edward Parry]]. In 1857, the modern townsite was established near the [[Ojibwa]] village of [[Wasauksing First Nation|Wasauksing]] (\"shining shore\") at the mouth of the [[Seguin River]]. Parry Sound was incorporated as a town in 1887.  In the late 19th century, [[railway|rail]] service was established, making the town an important depot along the rail lines to [[Western Canada]].\n\nIn 1916, a [[cordite]] factory was established in the nearby town of [[Nobel, Ontario|Nobel]] for the [[Imperial Munitions Board]]. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, an [[explosives]] and [[munitions]] factory was also built at Nobel, making Parry Sound an important part of both the First World War and the Second World War effort.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:downtownParrySound.jpg|thumb|left|View of downtown Parry Sound near the intersection of Seguin and James Streets. A portion of the Sound and the CP railway trestle can be seen in the distance.]]\nParry Sound is the birthplace of hockey legend [[Bobby Orr]], the namesake of the local community centre and the town's own [[Bobby Orr Hall of Fame]].

The [[Charles W.

The eastern coast of Georgian Bay where Parry Sound is located is known as the \"30,000 Islands\" and is considered the world's largest freshwater archipelago.  It covers 347,000 hectares of shoreline ecosystem, and over 100 species of animals and plants that are at risk in Canada and Ontario, including unique reptiles and amphibians.  Parry Sound's Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary<ref>[http://www.aspenvalleywildlifesanctuary.com Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary]</ref> cares for injured and orphaned animals, and offers an informational and interpretive centre for wildlife education.

Sightseeing tours of the 30,000 Islands are offered by Georgian Bay Airways,<ref>[http://www.georgianbayairways.com Georgian Bay Airways]</ref> and the Island Queen and MV Chippawa<ref>[http://www.spiritofthesound.ca M.V. Chippewa]</ref> cruise ships. [[kayak]] and [[canoe]] rentals and tours are available during the summer, as well as winter sporting gear rentals during the winter.  The town is home to an annual ATV Jamboree<ref>[http://www.springjam.ca Spring Jam]</ref> and guided ATV tours of the region's wilderness are available throughout the year.<ref>[http://bearclawtours.com Bear Claw Tours]</ref>  There are several [[golf courses]] located in and near Parry Sound; [[ice hockey]], [[fishing]] and [[softball]] are also popular recreational sports in the area.  Famous NHLer [[Bobby Orr]] played minor hockey for the Parry Sound Shamrocks. Aidan Dudas also played for the Shamrocks, and currently plays for the [[Owen Sound Attack]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL]], and was selected in the fourth round (113th overall) of the [[2019 NHL Draft]] by the [[Los Angeles Kings]]. The town had a junior team also called the Shamrocks for a short period of time who reached the [[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association]] championship finals in 1998 and 1999 before the team folded in 2003.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Image:Parry Sound ON.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Harbour of Parry Sound]]\nParry Sound is located along a highway which currently bears the dual designation of [[Ontario Highway 69|Highway 69]]/[[Ontario Highway 400|Highway 400]]. From the opening of this [[freeway]] alignment in 2004 until October 26, 2010, a point one kilometre north of Parry Sound's Bowes Street/McDougall Road interchange was the terminus of Highway 400, but the freeway now begins 17 kilometres further north, at [[Ontario Highway 559|Highway 559]] north of [[Nobel, Ontario|Nobel]].<ref name=\"nobel\">{{cite news\n |title       = $177-million section of highway now open\n |first       = Cameron\n |last        = Ginn\n |publisher   = Metroland Media Group\n |work        = Cottage Country Now\n |date        = October 27, 2010\n |url         = http://www.cottagecountrynow.ca/community/parrysound/article/893665\n |accessdate  = October 28, 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110424214321/http://www.cottagecountrynow.ca/community/parrysound/article/893665\n |archivedate = April 24, 2011\n}}</ref> The former alignment of Highway 69 from Parry Sound southerly to [[Holmur, Ontario|Holmur]] now has the street name [[Oastler Park Drive]] and serves as the main access road to [[Oastler Lake Provincial Park]].\n\nThe western termini of [[Ontario Highway 124|Highway 124]], which extends easterly to [[Sundridge, Ontario|Sundridge]], and [[Ontario Highway 518|Highway 518]], which heads east to [[Kearney, Ontario|Kearney]], are both located just outside Parry Sound's town limits.\n\nBus service from [[Toronto]] is available by [[Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services]], the government-owned transportation company, and buses arrive daily en route to Sudbury.  In addition, [[Via Rail]]'s ''[[Canadian (train)|Canadian]]'' (Toronto \u2013 [[Vancouver]]) [[Transcontinental railroad|transcontinental]] passenger train serve [[Parry Sound railway station]]s three times a week both east- and westbound. Westbound passenger as well as [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[Canadian National Railway]] freight trains are carried over the Seguin River by the [[Parry Sound CPR Trestle]], a visible presence in the centre of town.\n\nThe town is served by the [[Parry Sound Area Municipal Airport]] and the [[List of heliports in Canada#188|Parry Sound Medical Heliport]], as well as numerous small water [[aerodromes]]:\n* [[Parry Sound Harbour Water Aerodrome]] (CPS1)\n* [[Parry Sound/Deep Bay Water Aerodrome]] (CPT6)\n* [[Parry Sound/Derbyshire Island Water Aerodrome]] (CDS6)\n* [[Parry Sound/Frying Pan Island-Sans Souci Water Aerodrome]] (CPS9)\n* [[Parry Sound/Huron Island Water Aerodrome]] (CPS8)\n* [[Parry Sound/St. Waleran Island Water Aerodrome]] (CPD6)\n\nThe Big Sound Marina<ref>[http://www.bigsoundmarina.com Big Sound Marina]</ref> is a 120-serviced slip marina on Georgian Bay for transient vessels up to {{convert|60|ft|m|0}}.\n\n==Climate==\n\nParry Sound has a humid continental climate, with some quite-unusual local variations in cloudiness and precipitation for this climate, resulting from its location on the eastern shore of the large body of water comprising Parry Sound and Lake Huron to its west. Parry Sound's annual temperature regime reflects a cool-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Koppen]] Dfb), with January average temperatures of {{convert|-9.0|C}} and July average temperatures near {{convert|20.2|C}}, and the usual minimal seasonal lag typical of continental climates, i.e. January as the coldest month, July as the warmest.\n\nMuch more unusual (for Dfb climates) is Parry Sound's average annual cycle of precipitation, and cloudiness vs. sunshine. With its location on the eastern side of large bodies of water, where prevailing winds and weather come from the west (typical in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere), Parry Sound experiences an exceptionally strong [[Lake-effect snow|lake effect]]. From spring to mid-summer, this means lake waters are cooler than nearby land areas, resulting in diminished intensity of low pressure systems and less precipitation, but alternation of low clouds and fog (resulting from warmer air passing over snow-covered ground, frequent into May most years) with occasional sunshine, especially once the long winter's snow cover has melted (mostly May through July). Parry Sound's average driest month is July; here, thunderstorms are rare, due to cool lake waters inhibiting the combination of heat and humidity that fuels thunderstorm activity over areas like the central, southern and eastern United States.\n\nFrom September to January in Parry Sound the lake effect reverses its stabilizing effect from spring into mid-summer, becoming destabilizing. During these months, nearby waters release their stored warmth from the summer season, and increasingly strong polar and Arctic air outbreaks pass over these still-relatively-warm waters before hitting Parry Sound. This results in heavy [[cumulus cloud]] formation, instability rain showers (in September and October), transitioning toward heavy snow showers and squalls as temperatures continue to drop from November to January. Parry Sound's average monthly precipitation exceeds {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} inches every month from September to January - but this pattern peaks in December, the year's average wettest month, which averages over {{convert|137|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation, mostly carried by that month's average of {{convert|101.6|cm|abbr=on}} of snow, followed by January's snowfall average of {{convert|91.2|cm|abbr=on}}. Such heavy winter-month precipitation and snowfall figures are virtually nonexistent in humid continental climates, which tend to exist away from large bodies of water. As winter transitions toward spring, snowfall drops sharply by March, when lake and land temperatures nearly equalize. In winter, the heavy lake-effect snowfall is augmented by snowfall from sometimes-strong low-pressure systems (mid-latitude [[cyclone]]s) that often converge on the [[Great Lakes]] and areas further east.\n\nOverall, Parry Sound experiences a typical humid continental, cool-summer climate type in terms of temperatures - but a highly unusual climate regime in precipitation and cloudiness; the year's driest months are generally from March through July, while its wettest months are from September to January, with autumnal lake effect producing cloudy skies and heavy rainfall from September into November, followed by extremely heavy snowfall in December and January.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Parry Sound was {{convert|37.8|C}} on July 6, 1921.

Parry Sound Forest Fire District was founded by Ontario's former Department of Lands and Forests (now the MNR) in 1922 as one of 17 districts to help protect Ontario's forests from fire by early detection from [[fire tower]]s. The headquarters for the district were housed in town. It was the central location for 18 [[fire tower]] lookouts, including the Parry Sound fire tower, which was erected in the same location as the modern lookout tower at 17 George Street. In the 1970s all the towers had been decommissioned as aerial fire fighting techniques were employed. Fire suppression is of enhanced concern in and near Parry Sound due to this area's strong tendency toward drier weather coinciding with the period of highest sun, in June and July. In drier-summer years, drought can be a significant concern here, and with it, heightened wildfire risk.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Radio===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Frequency\n!Call sign\n!Branding\n!Format\n!Owner\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 88.9\n|[[CBPO-FM]]\n|[[Weatheradio Canada]] \n|[[Weather radio]]\n|[[Meteorological Service of Canada]]\n|\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 89.9\n|[[CBLA-FM|CBLR-FM]]\n|[[CBC Radio One]]\n|[[Talk radio]], [[Public broadcasting|public radio]]\n|[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CBLA-FM]] ([[Toronto]])\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 91.3\n|[[CHRZ-FM]]\n|Rez 91\n|[[First Nations]] [[community radio]]\n|Wasauksing Communications Group\n|Broadcasts in English and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 103.3\n|[[CKLP-FM]]\n|Moose FM\n|[[Adult hits]]\n|[[Vista Broadcast Group]]\n|\n|}\n\n===Television===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n![[Terrestrial television|OTA]] channel\n!Call sign\n!Network\n!Notes\n|-\n|7 ([[very high frequency|VHF]])\n|[[CIII-DT|CIII-DT-7]]\n|[[Global Television Network|Global]]\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CIII-DT]] ([[Toronto]])\n|-\n|12 ([[very high frequency|VHF]])\n|[[CKVR-DT|CKVR-TV-1]]\n|[[CTV Two]]\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CKVR-DT]] ([[Barrie]])\n|-\n|23 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]])\n|[[CHCH-DT|CHCH-DT-3]]\n|''Independent''\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CHCH-DT]] ([[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]])\n|}\n\n===Newspapers===\n* North Star - [http://www.parrysound.com The Parry Sound North Star]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = \n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    =\n|1871|1052\n|1901|2884\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|3429\n|1921|3546\n|1931|3512\n|1941|5765\n|1951|5183\n|1961|6004\n|1971|5842\n|1981|6124\n|1991|6125\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|6326\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|6124\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|5818\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|6191\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|6408\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Canada 2006 Census!!

Parry Sound is located {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and {{convert|225|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Toronto]]. It is a single tier government located in the territorial District of Parry Sound which has no second tier County, Regional or District level of government. Parry Sound is a popular [[cottage|cottage country]] region for [[Southern Ontario]] residents. It also has the world's deepest natural freshwater port.<ref name=\"Society2007\">{{cite book|title=Canadian Geographic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knUZAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2012|volume=127|year=2007|publisher=Royal Canadian Geographical Society|page=82|quote= Parry Sound, the world's deepest freshwater port, lends some measure to what I mean by Ontario Lake Country}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nDuring the early part of the 20th century, the area was a popular subject for the many scenic art works of [[Tom Thomson]] and members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. There was a slight decline in economic activity shortly after World War I with [[J.R. Booth]]'s construction of a rival town, [[Depot Harbour, Ontario|Depot Harbour]] on nearby [[Parry Island, Ontario|Parry Island]], but this setback was overcome through later developments in tourism and commerce, and the accidental destruction by fire of the entire town of Depot Harbour on August 14, 1945.\n\nThe body of water that gives the town its name was surveyed and named by Captain [[Henry Bayfield]] in the 19th century, in honour of the Arctic explorer Sir [[William Edward Parry]]. In 1857, the modern townsite was established near the [[Ojibwa]] village of [[Wasauksing First Nation|Wasauksing]] (\"shining shore\") at the mouth of the [[Seguin River]]. Parry Sound was incorporated as a town in 1887.  In the late 19th century, [[railway|rail]] service was established, making the town an important depot along the rail lines to [[Western Canada]].\n\nIn 1916, a [[cordite]] factory was established in the nearby town of [[Nobel, Ontario|Nobel]] for the [[Imperial Munitions Board]]. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, an [[explosives]] and [[munitions]] factory was also built at Nobel, making Parry Sound an important part of both the First World War and the Second World War effort.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:downtownParrySound.jpg|thumb|left|View of downtown Parry Sound near the intersection of Seguin and James Streets. A portion of the Sound and the CP railway trestle can be seen in the distance.]]\nParry Sound is the birthplace of hockey legend [[Bobby Orr]], the namesake of the local community centre and the town's own [[Bobby Orr Hall of Fame]]. In Orr's best-selling autobiography, ''[[Orr: My Story (book)|Orr: My Story]]'', he speaks highly of Parry Sound, the friends and family who resided there and the happy childhood he had living in that part of Canada.<ref name=\"Orr\">Orr, Bobby (2013) ''Bobby Orr: My Story''.

Former Ontario premier [[Ernie Eves]] also called the town home for many years; he was the [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]] for the [[Parry Sound\u2014Muskoka (provincial electoral district)|Parry Sound\u2014Muskoka]] riding from 1981 through 2001.\n\nThe town is home to several cultural festivals, including the [[Festival of the Sound]] classical music festival, an annual [[dragonboat]] race and a [[buskers]]' festival which takes place as part of the town's [[Canada Day]] festivities. The [[Charles W. Stockey Centre for the Performing Arts]] serves as the principal performance venue during the Festival of the Sound, and also hosts concerts, live theatre and other cultural events throughout the year.\n\n==Recreation and sports==\nThere are several [[provincial park]]s in the Parry Sound area, including [[Oastler Lake Provincial Park|Oastler Lake]], [[The Massasauga Provincial Park|The Massasauga]] and [[Killbear Provincial Park|Killbear]], as well as numerous provincial [[Nature Reserve Park (Ontario)|conservation reserve]]s, including the Georgian Bay Biosphere Reserve, one of only 13 UNESCO sites in Canada. The eastern coast of Georgian Bay where Parry Sound is located is known as the \"30,000 Islands\" and is considered the world's largest freshwater archipelago.  It covers 347,000 hectares of shoreline ecosystem, and over 100 species of animals and plants that are at risk in Canada and Ontario, including unique reptiles and amphibians.  Parry Sound's Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary<ref>[http://www.aspenvalleywildlifesanctuary.com Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary]</ref> cares for injured and orphaned animals, and offers an informational and interpretive centre for wildlife education.  A 230-kilometre recreational trail, the Park-to-Park Trail, connects Killbear with [[Algonquin Provincial Park]] in two locations, to the south at [[Dwight, Ontario|Dwight]], and farther north, east of [[Kearney, Ontario|Kearney]].<ref>[http://www.parktoparktrail.com/ The Park-to-Park Trail]</ref>\n\n[[File:ON ParrySound tango7174.jpg|thumb|230px|Departure point at the harbour, for the sightseeing tours of the 30,000 Islands]]\n\nParry Sound, and much of Northern Ontario, are well known for their tourism businesses.  Accommodation businesses range from hotels and full service resorts to lodges and camping grounds.  Sightseeing tours of the 30,000 Islands are offered by Georgian Bay Airways,<ref>[http://www.georgianbayairways.com Georgian Bay Airways]</ref> and the Island Queen and MV Chippawa<ref>[http://www.spiritofthesound.ca M.V. Chippewa]</ref> cruise ships. [[kayak]] and [[canoe]] rentals and tours are available during the summer, as well as winter sporting gear rentals during the winter.  The town is home to an annual ATV Jamboree<ref>[http://www.springjam.ca Spring Jam]</ref> and guided ATV tours of the region's wilderness are available throughout the year.<ref>[http://bearclawtours.com Bear Claw Tours]</ref>  There are several [[golf courses]] located in and near Parry Sound; [[ice hockey]], [[fishing]] and [[softball]] are also popular recreational sports in the area.  Famous NHLer [[Bobby Orr]] played minor hockey for the Parry Sound Shamrocks. Aidan Dudas also played for the Shamrocks, and currently plays for the [[Owen Sound Attack]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL]], and was selected in the fourth round (113th overall) of the [[2019 NHL Draft]] by the [[Los Angeles Kings]]. The town had a junior team also called the Shamrocks for a short period of time who reached the [[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association]] championship finals in 1998 and 1999 before the team folded in 2003.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Image:Parry Sound ON.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Harbour of Parry Sound]]\nParry Sound is located along a highway which currently bears the dual designation of [[Ontario Highway 69|Highway 69]]/[[Ontario Highway 400|Highway 400]]. From the opening of this [[freeway]] alignment in 2004 until October 26, 2010, a point one kilometre north of Parry Sound's Bowes Street/McDougall Road interchange was the terminus of Highway 400, but the freeway now begins 17 kilometres further north, at [[Ontario Highway 559|Highway 559]] north of [[Nobel, Ontario|Nobel]].<ref name=\"nobel\">{{cite news\n |title       = $177-million section of highway now open\n |first       = Cameron\n |last        = Ginn\n |publisher   = Metroland Media Group\n |work        = Cottage Country Now\n |date        = October 27, 2010\n |url         = http://www.cottagecountrynow.ca/community/parrysound/article/893665\n |accessdate  = October 28, 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110424214321/http://www.cottagecountrynow.ca/community/parrysound/article/893665\n |archivedate = April 24, 2011\n}}</ref> The former alignment of Highway 69 from Parry Sound southerly to [[Holmur, Ontario|Holmur]] now has the street name [[Oastler Park Drive]] and serves as the main access road to [[Oastler Lake Provincial Park]].\n\nThe western termini of [[Ontario Highway 124|Highway 124]], which extends easterly to [[Sundridge, Ontario|Sundridge]], and [[Ontario Highway 518|Highway 518]], which heads east to [[Kearney, Ontario|Kearney]], are both located just outside Parry Sound's town limits.\n\nBus service from [[Toronto]] is available by [[Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services]], the government-owned transportation company, and buses arrive daily en route to Sudbury.  In addition, [[Via Rail]]'s ''[[Canadian (train)|Canadian]]'' (Toronto \u2013 [[Vancouver]]) [[Transcontinental railroad|transcontinental]] passenger train serve [[Parry Sound railway station]]s three times a week both east- and westbound. Westbound passenger as well as [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[Canadian National Railway]] freight trains are carried over the Seguin River by the [[Parry Sound CPR Trestle]], a visible presence in the centre of town.\n\nThe town is served by the [[Parry Sound Area Municipal Airport]] and the [[List of heliports in Canada#188|Parry Sound Medical Heliport]], as well as numerous small water [[aerodromes]]:\n* [[Parry Sound Harbour Water Aerodrome]] (CPS1)\n* [[Parry Sound/Deep Bay Water Aerodrome]] (CPT6)\n* [[Parry Sound/Derbyshire Island Water Aerodrome]] (CDS6)\n* [[Parry Sound/Frying Pan Island-Sans Souci Water Aerodrome]] (CPS9)\n* [[Parry Sound/Huron Island Water Aerodrome]] (CPS8)\n* [[Parry Sound/St. Waleran Island Water Aerodrome]] (CPD6)\n\nThe Big Sound Marina<ref>[http://www.bigsoundmarina.com Big Sound Marina]</ref> is a 120-serviced slip marina on Georgian Bay for transient vessels up to {{convert|60|ft|m|0}}.\n\n==Climate==\n\nParry Sound has a humid continental climate, with some quite-unusual local variations in cloudiness and precipitation for this climate, resulting from its location on the eastern shore of the large body of water comprising Parry Sound and Lake Huron to its west. Parry Sound's annual temperature regime reflects a cool-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Koppen]] Dfb), with January average temperatures of {{convert|-9.0|C}} and July average temperatures near {{convert|20.2|C}}, and the usual minimal seasonal lag typical of continental climates, i.e. January as the coldest month, July as the warmest.\n\nMuch more unusual (for Dfb climates) is Parry Sound's average annual cycle of precipitation, and cloudiness vs. sunshine. With its location on the eastern side of large bodies of water, where prevailing winds and weather come from the west (typical in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere), Parry Sound experiences an exceptionally strong [[Lake-effect snow|lake effect]]. From spring to mid-summer, this means lake waters are cooler than nearby land areas, resulting in diminished intensity of low pressure systems and less precipitation, but alternation of low clouds and fog (resulting from warmer air passing over snow-covered ground, frequent into May most years) with occasional sunshine, especially once the long winter's snow cover has melted (mostly May through July). Parry Sound's average driest month is July; here, thunderstorms are rare, due to cool lake waters inhibiting the combination of heat and humidity that fuels thunderstorm activity over areas like the central, southern and eastern United States.\n\nFrom September to January in Parry Sound the lake effect reverses its stabilizing effect from spring into mid-summer, becoming destabilizing. During these months, nearby waters release their stored warmth from the summer season, and increasingly strong polar and Arctic air outbreaks pass over these still-relatively-warm waters before hitting Parry Sound. This results in heavy [[cumulus cloud]] formation, instability rain showers (in September and October), transitioning toward heavy snow showers and squalls as temperatures continue to drop from November to January. Parry Sound's average monthly precipitation exceeds {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} inches every month from September to January - but this pattern peaks in December, the year's average wettest month, which averages over {{convert|137|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation, mostly carried by that month's average of {{convert|101.6|cm|abbr=on}} of snow, followed by January's snowfall average of {{convert|91.2|cm|abbr=on}}. Such heavy winter-month precipitation and snowfall figures are virtually nonexistent in humid continental climates, which tend to exist away from large bodies of water. As winter transitions toward spring, snowfall drops sharply by March, when lake and land temperatures nearly equalize. In winter, the heavy lake-effect snowfall is augmented by snowfall from sometimes-strong low-pressure systems (mid-latitude [[cyclone]]s) that often converge on the [[Great Lakes]] and areas further east.\n\nOverall, Parry Sound experiences a typical humid continental, cool-summer climate type in terms of temperatures - but a highly unusual climate regime in precipitation and cloudiness; the year's driest months are generally from March through July, while its wettest months are from September to January, with autumnal lake effect producing cloudy skies and heavy rainfall from September into November, followed by extremely heavy snowfall in December and January.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Parry Sound was {{convert|37.8|C}} on July 6, 1921. The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-41.1|C|0}} on February 12. 1967.<ref name=\"July 1921\"/><ref name=\"February 1967\"/>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Parry Sound, 1981\u22122010

Parry Sound Forest Fire District was founded by Ontario's former Department of Lands and Forests (now the MNR) in 1922 as one of 17 districts to help protect Ontario's forests from fire by early detection from [[fire tower]]s. The headquarters for the district were housed in town. It was the central location for 18 [[fire tower]] lookouts, including the Parry Sound fire tower, which was erected in the same location as the modern lookout tower at 17 George Street. In the 1970s all the towers had been decommissioned as aerial fire fighting techniques were employed. Fire suppression is of enhanced concern in and near Parry Sound due to this area's strong tendency toward drier weather coinciding with the period of highest sun, in June and July. In drier-summer years, drought can be a significant concern here, and with it, heightened wildfire risk.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Radio===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Frequency\n!Call sign\n!Branding\n!Format\n!Owner\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 88.9\n|[[CBPO-FM]]\n|[[Weatheradio Canada]] \n|[[Weather radio]]\n|[[Meteorological Service of Canada]]\n|\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 89.9\n|[[CBLA-FM|CBLR-FM]]\n|[[CBC Radio One]]\n|[[Talk radio]], [[Public broadcasting|public radio]]\n|[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CBLA-FM]] ([[Toronto]])\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 91.3\n|[[CHRZ-FM]]\n|Rez 91\n|[[First Nations]] [[community radio]]\n|Wasauksing Communications Group\n|Broadcasts in English and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]\n|-\n|[[FM broadcasting|FM]] 103.3\n|[[CKLP-FM]]\n|Moose FM\n|[[Adult hits]]\n|[[Vista Broadcast Group]]\n|\n|}\n\n===Television===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n![[Terrestrial television|OTA]] channel\n!Call sign\n!Network\n!Notes\n|-\n|7 ([[very high frequency|VHF]])\n|[[CIII-DT|CIII-DT-7]]\n|[[Global Television Network|Global]]\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CIII-DT]] ([[Toronto]])\n|-\n|12 ([[very high frequency|VHF]])\n|[[CKVR-DT|CKVR-TV-1]]\n|[[CTV Two]]\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CKVR-DT]] ([[Barrie]])\n|-\n|23 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]])\n|[[CHCH-DT|CHCH-DT-3]]\n|''Independent''\n|Rebroadcaster of [[CHCH-DT]] ([[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]])\n|}\n\n===Newspapers===\n* North Star - [http://www.parrysound.com The Parry Sound North Star]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = \n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    =\n|1871|1052\n|1901|2884\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|3429\n|1921|3546\n|1931|3512\n|1941|5765\n|1951|5183\n|1961|6004\n|1971|5842\n|1981|6124\n|1991|6125\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|6326\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|6124\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|5818\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|6191\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|6408\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Canada 2006 Census!!

''Normandie'' held the [[Blue Riband]] for the fastest [[transatlantic crossing]] at several points during her service career, during which the {{RMS|Queen Mary}} was her main rival.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], ''Normandie'' was seized by U.S. authorities at New York and renamed USS ''Lafayette''. In 1942, the liner caught fire while being converted to a [[troopship]], capsized onto her port side and came to rest on the mud of the [[Hudson River]] at Pier 88, the site of the current [[New York Passenger Ship Terminal]]. Although salvaged at great expense, restoration was deemed too costly and she was scrapped in October 1946.<ref name=cross391>Maxtone-Graham, 1972, p. 391</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe beginnings of ''Normandie'' can be traced to the [[Roaring Twenties]] when shipping companies began looking to replace veterans such as {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|6}} (1906) and {{RMS|Olympic}} (1911).<ref name=ardman36>Ardman 1985, p. 36</ref> Those earlier ships had been designed around the huge numbers of steerage-class immigrants from Europe to the United States. When the U.S. closed the door on most immigration in the early 1920s, steamship companies ordered vessels built to serve upper-class tourists instead, particularly Americans who traveled to Europe to escape the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition of alcohol]].<ref name=palaces/> Companies like [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] and the [[White Star Line]] planned to build their own [[Superliner (passenger ship)|superliners]]<ref name=cross269>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 268\u201369</ref> to rival newer ships of the day; such vessels included the record-breaking {{SS|Bremen|1929|2}} and {{SS|Europa|1930|2}}, both German.<ref name=palaces/> The French Line began to plan its own superliner.<ref name=ardman36/>\n\n[[Image:Normandie poster.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|[[Adolphe Mouron Cassandre|Adolphe Cassandre]]'s famed 1935 depiction of the SS ''Normandie''.]]\nThe French Line's flagship was the {{SS|Ile de France|3=2}}, which had modern [[Art Deco]] interiors but a conservative hull design.<ref name=ardman36/> The designers intended their new superliner to be similar to earlier French Line ships. Then they were approached by [[Vladimir Yourkevitch]], a former ship architect for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], who had emigrated to France after the revolution.<ref name=ardman36/>  His ideas included a slanting clipper-like bow and a [[Bulbous bow|bulbous forefoot]] beneath the waterline, in combination with a slim hydrodynamic hull. Yourkevitch's concepts worked wonderfully in scale models, confirming his design's performance advantages.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 42\u201347</ref><ref name=cross273>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 273</ref> The French engineers were impressed and asked Yourkevitch to join their project. He also approached Cunard with his ideas, but was rejected because the bow was deemed too radical.<ref name=palaces/>\n\nThe French Line commissioned artists to create posters and publicity for the liner. One of the most famous posters was by [[Adolphe Mouron Cassandre]], who was also a Russian emigrant to France.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5D91E3EF935A15755C0A96E948260|title=Antiques - A Proliferation Of Poster Art|date=1988-06-26|newspaper=The New York Times|last=Reif|first=Rita|accessdate=2008-11-19}}</ref> Another poster by Albert S\u00e9bille, showed the interior layout in a cutaway diagram 15 feet long.

While the French continued construction, the competing [[White Star Line]] ship (intended as [[Oceanic (unfinished ship)|''Oceanic'']], and started before the crash) was cancelled and Cunard's ''Queen Mary'' was put on hold.<ref name=cross269/> French builders also ran into difficulty and had to ask for government money; this subsidy was questioned in the press. Still, building was followed by newspapers and national interest was deep, as she was designed to represent France in the nation-state contest of the great liners and was built in a French shipyard using French parts.<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 269\u2013272</ref>\n\nThe growing hull in Saint-Nazaire had no formal designation except \"T-6\" (\"T\" for \"Transat\", an alternate name for the French Line, and \"6\" for \"6th\"), the contract name.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fvEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA881 \"T-6 The Latest Giant Of The Sea\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1932</ref> Many names were suggested including ''Doumer'', after [[Paul Doumer]], the recently assassinated [[President of France]]; and originally, ''La Belle France.''<ref name=cross272>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 272</ref> Finally ''Normandie'' was chosen. In France, boat prefixes properly depend on the boat name's gender, but non-sailors mostly use the masculine form,<ref name=cross272/> inherited from the French terms for boat, which can be \"paquebot\", \"navire\", \"bateau\", or \"b\u00e2timent\", but English speakers refer to boats as feminine (\"she's a beauty\"), and the French Line carried many rich American customers. French Line wrote that their boat was to be called simply \"''Normandie'',\" preceded by neither \"le\" nor \"la\" (French masculine/feminine for \"the\") to avoid any confusion.<ref name=cross273/>\n\n[[Image:Forme Joubert - porte et usine de pompage.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Louis Joubert Lock|''Normandie'' drydock in St. Nazaire]] which was built specifically for the new ship.]]\nOn 29 October 1932 \u2013 three years to the day after the [[stock market crash]] \u2013 ''Normandie'' was launched in front of 200,000 spectators.<ref name=cross275>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 275</ref> The 27,567-ton hull that slid into the [[Loire River]] was the largest launched and the wave crashed into a few hundred people, but with no injury.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 7, 17\u201320</ref> The boat was christened by Madame [[Marguerite Lebrun]], wife of [[Albert Lebrun]], the President of France. ''Normandie'' was [[fitting-out|outfitted]] until early 1935, her interiors, funnels, engines, and other fittings put in to make her into a working vessel. Finally, in May 1935, ''Normandie'' was ready for trials, which were watched by reporters.<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 281</ref> The superiority of Yourkevitch's hull was visible: hardly a wave was created off the bulbous bow. The ship reached a top speed of {{convert|32.125|kn|km/h}}<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 111</ref> and performed an emergency stop from that speed in {{convert|1,700|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}.\n\nIn addition to a novel hull which let her attain speed at far less power than other big liners,<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 171</ref> ''Normandie'' was filled with technical feats. She had [[turbo-electric transmission]], with turbo-generators and electric propulsion motors built by [[Alstom|Alsthom]] of [[Belfort]].<ref name=LR/> CGT chose turbo-electric transmission for the ability to use full power in reverse,<ref name=ardman46/> and because, according to CGT officials, it was quieter and more easily controlled and maintained.<ref name=ardman46/> The engine installation was heavier than conventional turbines and slightly less efficient at high speed but allowed all propellers to operate even if one engine was not running. This system also made it possible to eliminate astern turbines.<ref name=ardman46/> An early form of [[radar]] was installed to prevent collisions.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 160</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=x98DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA844 \"Radio Waves Warn of Obstacles in Path\" ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1935]</ref>\n\nThe rudder frame, including the 125-ton cast steel connecting rod, was produced by [[\u0160koda Works]] in [[Czechoslovakia]].\nA less known technical novelty was, for the inaugural Atlantic crossing, the testing of a \u201cradar\u201d then called \"Obstacle detector\" built by Henry Gutton (SFR). Coincidently, the US coastal Artillery had also used the ship to test the detection capability of a thermal \u201cradar,\u201d the SCR-263T.    \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Interior==\nThe luxurious interiors were designed in [[Art Deco|Art D\u00e9co]] and [[Streamline Moderne]] style. Many sculptures and wall paintings made allusions to [[Normandy]], the province of France for which ''Normandie'' was named.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 80</ref> Drawings and photographs show a series of vast public rooms of great elegance. ''Normandie'''s voluminous interior spaces were made possible by having the funnel intakes split to pass along the sides of the ship, rather than straight upward.<ref name=cross275/> French architect [[Roger-Henri Expert]] was in charge of the overall decorative scheme.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/17/arts/design/17anti.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Art Deco Relics of the ''Normandie'' |first=Wendy |last=Moonan |date=2005-06-17}}</ref>\n\nMost of the public space was devoted to first-class passengers, including the dining room, first-class lounge, grill room, first-class [[swimming pool]], [[theatre]] and [[winter garden]].

''Normandie'' also had indoor and outdoor pools, a chapel, and a theatre which could double as a stage and cinema.<ref name=cross276/><ref>Ardman 1985, p. 91\u201392</ref>\n\nThe machinery of the top deck and [[forecastle]] was integrated within the ship, concealing it and releasing nearly all the exposed deck space for passengers. As such it was the only ocean liner to have a regulation-sized open air [[tennis court]] on board.<ref>{{cite book|title=Luxury Liners Life on Board | author=Catherine Donzel |year=2006 | publisher=Harry Abrams | p=109\u201311}}</ref> The air conditioner units were concealed along with the kennels inside the third, dummy, funnel.<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 273\u201375</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[Image:SS Normandie Le Havre maiden voyage.jpg|thumb|''Normandie'' arrives for the first time at her home port of [[Le Havre, France]], at the start of her record-breaking [[maiden voyage]].]]\n''Normandie'''s [[maiden voyage]] was on 29 May 1935. Fifty thousand saw her off at [[Le Havre]] on what was hoped would be a record-breaking crossing. ''Normandie'' reached New York after four days, three hours and two minutes, taking away the [[Blue Riband]] from the Italian liner, {{SS|Rex|3=2}}.<ref name=cross284>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 284</ref> This brought great pride for the French, who had not won the distinction before.

Cunard White Star said the ''Queen Mary'' would surpass 80,000 tons.<ref name=ardman166>Ardman 1985, p. 166\u2013170</ref> At 79,280 tons, ''Normandie'' would no longer be the world's largest. French Line increased ''Normandie''\u2019s size, mainly through the addition of an enclosed tourist lounge on the aft boat deck. Following these and other alterations, ''Normandie'' was 83,423 gross tons.<ref name=ardman166/> Exceeding the ''Queen Mary'' by 2,000 tons, she would soon become the world's largest in terms of overall measured gross tonnage and length once again, claiming it off the ''Queen Mary'' who only held it for a short amount of time.<ref name=ardman166/>\n\nOn 22 June 1936, a [[Blackburn Baffin]], [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|''S5162'']] of A Flight, [[HMS Sultan (establishment)|RAF Gosport]], flown by Lt Guy Kennedy Horsey on torpedo-dropping practice, buzzed ''Normandie'' a mile (2 km) off [[Ryde Pier]] and collided with a derrick which was transferring a motor car belonging to [[Arthur Evans (politician)|Arthur Evans]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]], onto a barge alongside the ship. The aircraft crashed onto ''Normandie{{'}}''s bow. The pilot was taken off by tender, but the wreckage of the aircraft remained on board ''Normandie'' as she had to sail due to the tide. It was carried to [[Le Havre]], [[France]]. A salvage team from the [[Royal Air Force]] later removed the wreckage. The pilot was [[court-martial]]led and found guilty on two charges.

Her three-bladed screws were replaced with four-bladed ones, and structural modifications were made to her lower aft section. These modifications reduced vibration at speed.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 172\u201373</ref><ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 286\u201387</ref> In July 1937 ''Normandie'' regained the Blue Riband, but the ''Queen Mary'' took it back next year. After this the captain of ''Normandie'' sent a message saying \"Bravo to the ''Queen Mary'' until next time!\" This rivalry could have gone on into the 1940s, but was ended by [[World War II]].\n\n''Normandie'' carried distinguished passengers, including the authors [[Colette]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]];<ref name=Ardman325>Ardman 1985, p. 325\u201326</ref> the wife of French President [[Albert Lebrun]];<ref name=cross284/> songwriters [[No\u00ebl Coward]] and [[Irving Berlin]]; and Hollywood celebrities such as [[Fred Astaire]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr]], and [[James Stewart]].<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 147, 184\u201385, 205, 218, 238</ref> ''Normandie'' also carried the [[Georg Ludwig von Trapp|von Trapp family singers]] of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' from New York to Southampton in 1938, and from Southampton, the family went to Scandinavia for a tour before returning to America.\n\n==Planned running mate - SS ''Bretagne''==\nWhile ''Normandie'' rarely was occupied at over 60% of her capacity, her finances were such that she did not require government subsidies every year. She never repaid any of the loans that made her construction possible. The French Line considered a sister ship, SS ''Bretagne'', which was to be longer and larger. There were two competing designs for this ship, one conservative, one radical. The conservative one was essentially ''Normandie'' with two funnels, possibly larger as well. The radical one was from ''Normandie''{{'}}s designer, Vladimir Yourkevitch, and was super-streamlined with twin, side-by-side funnels just aft of the bridge. The more conservative design won, but the outbreak of [[World War II]] halted the plan indefinitely.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 237, 423</ref><ref>Williams, David L., and De Kerbrech, R. P. ''Damned by Destiny''. 1982</ref>\n\n==Popularity==\nAlthough ''Normandie'' was a critical success in her design and decor, ultimately North Atlantic passengers flocked to the more traditional ''Queen Mary''. Two of the ship's greatest attributes, in reality, turned out to be two of her biggest faults.\n\n[[File:Jeton du paquebot Normandie, 1930-1940.jpg|thumb|''Normandie'' depicted on a token]]\n[[File:Luftaufnahme der Normandie.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Overhead view of ''Normandie'' at sea]]\nPart of the ship's problem lay in the fact that the majority of her passenger space was devoted solely to first class, which could carry up to 848 people. Less space and consideration were given to second and tourist class, which numbered only 670 and 454 passengers respectively. As a result, the consensus among North Atlantic passengers was that she was primarily a ship for the rich and famous. In contrast, in ''Queen Mary'', Cunard  White Star had placed just as much emphasis on decor, space, and accommodation in second and tourist class as in first class. Thus ''Queen Mary'' accommodated American tourists, who had become numerous in the 1920s and the 1930s. Many of these passengers could not afford first-class passage, yet wanted to travel with much of the same comfort as those experienced in first. As a result, second and tourist class became a major cash source for shipping companies at that time. ''Queen Mary'' would accommodate these trends and subsequently the liner achieved greater popularity among North Atlantic travellers during the late thirties.<ref name=\"thegreatoceanliners.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreatoceanliners.com/normandie2.html|title=TGOL - Normandie|website=www.thegreatoceanliners.com}}</ref>\n\nAnother of the French Liner's greatest triumphs also turned out to be one of her greatest flaws: her decor. ''Normandie''{{'}}s slick and modern art deco interiors proved to be somewhat intimidating and uncomfortable for her travellers. It was also here that ''Queen Mary'' triumphed over her French rival. Although also decorated in an art deco style, ''Queen Mary'' was more restrained in her appointments and was not as radical as ''Normandie'', and proved ultimately to be more popular with  travellers.<ref name=\"thegreatoceanliners.com\"/>\n\n[[File:SS Normandie in NYC Harbor at Pier.jpg|thumb|''Normandie'' at C.G.T.'s pier 88 in New York]]\nAs a result, ''Normandie'' at many times throughout her service history carried less than half her full complement of passengers. Her German rivals {{SS|Bremen|1929|2}} and {{SS|Europa|1928|2}}, and Italian rivals {{SS|Rex||2}} and {{SS|Conte di Savoia||2}} also suffered from this problem; despite their innovative designs and luxurious interiors, they made little profit for their respective companies. Contributing to this were international boycotts against Germany after 1933 and the same with Italy in the late 1930s as the European geo-political situation deteriorated. The Italian liners were relying heavily on government subsidies, while the German Lloyd liners never received funding. In comparison, ''Normandie'' did not require government subsidies in service, with her income covering not only her operating expenses, but generating revenue of 158,000,000 francs.\n\nIn contrast, Cunard White Star's ''Britannic III'', ''Georgic II'', and much older ''Aquitania'', along with the [[Holland America Line]]'s {{SS|Nieuw Amsterdam|1937|3=6}}, were among the few North Atlantic liners to make a profit, carrying the lion's share of passengers in the years preceding [[World War II]]. ''Queen Mary'', as ''Mauretania II'' earned only after WWII real profits.\n\n==World War II==\nThe outbreak of the war found ''Normandie'' in New York harbor. Looming hostilities in Europe had compelled ''Normandie'' to seek haven there. The U.S. government [[Internment|interned]] her on 3 September 1939, the same day [[France]] declared war on [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Soon the ''Queen Mary'', later refitted as a troop ship, moored\nnearby. Then, 2 weeks later, {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} joined the ''Queen Mary''. For 5 months, the three largest liners in the world were tied up side by side.<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 360\u201361</ref> ''Normandie'' remained in French hands, with French crewmembers on board, led by Captain Herv\u00e9 Lehu\u00e9d\u00e9, into the spring of 1940.\n\nOn 15 May 1940, during the [[battle of France]], the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] detailed about 150 Coast Guardsmen to go on board the ship and Pier&nbsp;88 to defend it against possible [[sabotage]].  (Under then-current U.S. law, the U.S. Coast Guard was a part of the Treasury during peacetime.)  When the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] (USCG) became a part of the Navy on 1 November 1941, ''Normandie''{{'}}s USCG detail remained intact, mainly observing while the French crew maintained the vessel's boilers, machinery, and other equipment, including the fire-watch system. On 12 December 1941, five days after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the Coast Guard removed Captain Lehu\u00e9d\u00e9 and his crew and took possession of the ''Normandie'' under the right of [[angary]], maintaining steam in the boilers and other activities on the idled vessel. However, the elaborate fire-watch system which ensured that any fire would be suppressed before it became a danger was abandoned.<ref>Braynard, Frank O. ''History of the Normandie''. 1987: Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-25257-4}}. p. 87</ref>\n\n===''Lafayette'' conversion===\n[[File:SS Normandie Pier 88 1941 view.jpg|thumb|''Normandie'' docked in New York harbor at Pier 88, site of attempted troopship conversion.]]\n\nOn 20 December 1941, the Auxiliary Vessels Board officially recorded President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s approval of ''Normandie'''s transfer to the U.S. Navy. Plans called for the vessel to be turned into a [[troopship]] (\"convoy unit loaded transport\"). The Navy renamed her USS ''Lafayette'', in honor both of [[Marquis de la Fayette]], the French general who fought on the [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonies]]' behalf in the [[American Revolution]], and the alliance with France that made American independence possible. The name was a suggestion of J.P. \"Jim\" Warburg, advisory assistant to Colonel [[William J. Donovan]], [[Coordinator of Information]], which was passed through multiple channels including the [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Frank Knox]], Admiral [[Harold R. Stark]], [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO), and Rear Adm. Randall Jacobs, Chief of the [[Bureau of Navigation]]; the name ''La Fayette'' (later universally and unofficially contracted to ''Lafayette'') was officially approved by the Secretary of the Navy on 31 December 1941, with the vessel classified as a transport, AP-53.\n\nEarlier proposals included turning the vessel into an aircraft carrier, but this was dropped in favor of immediate troop transport.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 274\u2013276</ref> The ship remained moored at Manhattan's [[New York Passenger Ship Terminal|Pier 88]] for the conversion. A contract for her conversion to a troop transport was awarded to Robins Dry Dock and Repair Co., a subsidiary of [[Vigor Shipyards|Todd Shipyards]], on 27 December 1941. On that date, Capt. Clayton M. Simmers, the 3rd Naval District Materiel Officer, reported to the Bureau of Ships (BuShips) his estimate that the conversion work could be completed by 31 January 1942, and planning for the work proceeded on that basis.\n\nCapt. Robert G. Coman reported as ''Lafayette'''s prospective commanding officer on 31 January 1942, overseeing a skeleton engineering force numbering 458 men. The complicated nature and enormous size of the conversion effort prevented Coman's crew from adhering to the original schedule; crew familiarization with the vessel was an issue, and additional crew members were arriving to assist the effort. On 6 February 1942, a request for a two-week delay for the first sailing of ''Lafayette'', originally scheduled for 14 February, was submitted to the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations. On that day, a schedule extension was granted due to a design plan change: elements of the superstructure were to be removed to improve stability, in work that was expected to take another 60 to 90 days. However, on 7 February, orders came from Washington that the reduction of the top-hamper had been abandoned and ''Lafayette'' was to sail on 14 February as planned. This abrupt reversal necessitated a frantic resumption of conversion work, and Captains Coman and Simmers scheduled 9 February{{clarify|date=December 2012}} meetings in New York and Washington to lobby for further clarification of conversion plans; ultimately, these meetings would never take place.\n\n===Fire and Capsizing===\n[[Image:Normandie fire.jpg|thumb|''Lafayette'' (AP-53) afire at New York harbor on 9 February 1942]]\nAt 14:30 on 9 February 1942, sparks from a welding torch used by Clement Derrick ignited a stack of life vests filled with flammable [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]] that had been stored in the first-class lounge.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 299</ref><ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 367\u201368</ref> The woodwork had not yet been removed, and the fire spread rapidly. The ship had a very efficient fire protection system, but it had been disconnected during the conversion and its internal pumping system was deactivated.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 272, 304\u201314</ref> The New York City fire department's hoses, unfortunately, did not fit the ship's French inlets. Before the fire department arrived, approximately 15 minutes after fire broke out, all onboard crew were using manual means in a vain attempt to stop the blaze. A strong northwesterly wind blowing over ''Lafayette'''s port quarter swept the blaze forward, eventually involving the three upper decks of the ship within an hour of the start of the conflagration. Capt. Coman, along with Capt. Simmers, arrived about 15:25 to see his huge prospective command in flames.\n\n[[File:Normandie capsized (LIFE).jpg|left|thumb|USS ''Lafayette'' capsized in New York harbor.]]\nAs firefighters on shore and in fire boats poured water on the blaze, the ship developed a dangerous list to port due to water pumped into the seaward side by fireboats. The ship's designer [[Vladimir Yourkevitch]] arrived at the scene to offer expertise, but he was barred by harbor police.<ref name=Ardman325/><ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 373\u201374</ref> His suggestion was to enter the vessel and open the sea-cocks. This would flood the lower decks and make her settle the few feet to the bottom. With the ship stabilised, water could be pumped into burning areas without the risk of capsize. The suggestion was rejected by the commander of the [[3rd Naval District]], Rear Admiral [[Adolphus Andrews]].\n\nBetween 17:45 and 18:00 on 9 February 1942, authorities considered the fire under control, and began winding down operations until 20:00. Water entering the ship through submerged openings and flowing to the lower decks negated efforts to counter-flood, and ''Lafayette'''s list gradually increased to port. Shortly after midnight, Rear Adm. Andrews ordered ''Lafayette'' abandoned, and the ship continued to list, a process hastened by the 6,000 tons of water that had been sprayed on her. New York fire officials were concerned that the fire could spread to the nearby city buildings. ''Lafayette'' eventually [[capsize]]d during the mid watch (02:45) on 10 February, nearly crushing a fire boat, and came to rest on her port side at an angle of approximately 80 degrees. Recognising that his incompetence had caused the disaster, Admiral Andrews ordered all pressmen barred from viewing the moment of capsize in an effort to lower the level of publicity.<ref>History of the Normandie, Frank O Braynard (1987), Dover Publications 0-486-25257-4 p. 97</ref>\n\n[[Image:USS Lafayette 1942.jpg|thumb|''Normandie'', renamed USS ''Lafayette'', lies capsized in the frozen mud of her New York pier in the winter of 1942]]\nOne man died in the tragedy \u2014 Frank \"Trent\" Trentacosta, 36, of Brooklyn, a Robins' employee and a member of the fire watch. Some 94 USCG and USN sailors, including some from ''Lafayette'''s pre-commissioning crew and men assigned to the receiving ship ''[[USS Washington (ACR-11)|Seattle]]'', 38 fire fighters, and 153 civilians were treated for various injuries, burns, smoke inhalation, and exposure.\n\n====''Saboteur'' (film)====\n\nThe ruined ''Lafayette'' after the fire can be seen briefly in the film ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942). The ship is not identified in the film, but the antagonist smiles when he sees it, suggesting that he was responsible.

Extensive damage to her hull, however, deterioration of her machinery, and the necessity for employing manpower on other more critical war projects prevented resumption of the conversion program, with the cost of restoring her determined to be too great, and her hulk remained in the Navy's custody through the cessation of hostilities with the [[Axis powers]].\n\n''Lafayette'' was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 11 October 1945 without having ever sailed under the US flag. President [[Harry Truman]] authorized her disposal in an Executive Order on 8 September 1946, and she was sold as scrap on 3 October 1946 to Lipsett, Inc., an American [[Marine salvage|salvage]] company based in New York City, for [[United States dollar|US$]]161,680 (approx. $1,997,000 in 2017 value). After neither the U.S. Navy nor French Line offered a plan to salvage her, Yourkevitch, the ship's original designer, proposed to cut the ship down and restore her as a mid-sized liner.<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 392</ref> This plan also failed to draw backing. She was cut up for scrap beginning in October 1946<ref name=cross391/> at [[Port Newark, New Jersey]], and completely scrapped by 31 December 1948.\n\n==Legacy==\nDesigner Marin-Marie gave an innovative line to ''Normandie'', a silhouette which influenced ocean liners over the decades, including ''[[Queen Mary 2]]''. The ambience of classic transatlantic liners like ''Normandie'' (and her chief rival, ''Queen Mary'') was the source of inspiration for [[Disney Cruise Line]]'s matching vessels, ''[[Disney Magic]],'' ''[[Disney Wonder]]'', ''[[Disney Dream]]'', and ''[[Disney Fantasy]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.britishdesigninnovation.org/index.php?page=newsservice/view&news_id=2431 |title=Imagination Creates Atmosphere On Disney Wonder, UK |date=2003-05-27 |publisher=British Design Innovation |accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:San Juan, PR 05.jpg|thumb|The [[Normandie Hotel]] in San Juan, Puerto Rico]]\n''Normandie'' also inspired the architecture and design of the [[Normandie Hotel]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].

It also inspired the nickname 'The Normandie' given to the [[Wukang Mansion|International Savings Society Apartments]] in Shanghai, one of the most fashionable residential buildings during the city's pre-revolutionary heyday and home to several stars of China's mid-20th century film industry.\n\nItems from ''Normandie'' were sold at a series of auctions after her demise,<ref name=Ardman418>Ardman 1985, p. 418\u201320</ref> and many pieces are considered valuable [[Art Deco]] treasures today.

When the U.S. closed the door on most immigration in the early 1920s, steamship companies ordered vessels built to serve upper-class tourists instead, particularly Americans who traveled to Europe to escape the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition of alcohol]].<ref name=palaces/> Companies like [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] and the [[White Star Line]] planned to build their own [[Superliner (passenger ship)|superliners]]<ref name=cross269>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 268\u201369</ref> to rival newer ships of the day; such vessels included the record-breaking {{SS|Bremen|1929|2}} and {{SS|Europa|1930|2}}, both German.<ref name=palaces/> The French Line began to plan its own superliner.<ref name=ardman36/>\n\n[[Image:Normandie poster.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|[[Adolphe Mouron Cassandre|Adolphe Cassandre]]'s famed 1935 depiction of the SS ''Normandie''.]]\nThe French Line's flagship was the {{SS|Ile de France|3=2}}, which had modern [[Art Deco]] interiors but a conservative hull design.<ref name=ardman36/> The designers intended their new superliner to be similar to earlier French Line ships. Then they were approached by [[Vladimir Yourkevitch]], a former ship architect for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], who had emigrated to France after the revolution.<ref name=ardman36/>  His ideas included a slanting clipper-like bow and a [[Bulbous bow|bulbous forefoot]] beneath the waterline, in combination with a slim hydrodynamic hull. Yourkevitch's concepts worked wonderfully in scale models, confirming his design's performance advantages.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 42\u201347</ref><ref name=cross273>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 273</ref> The French engineers were impressed and asked Yourkevitch to join their project. He also approached Cunard with his ideas, but was rejected because the bow was deemed too radical.<ref name=palaces/>\n\nThe French Line commissioned artists to create posters and publicity for the liner. One of the most famous posters was by [[Adolphe Mouron Cassandre]], who was also a Russian emigrant to France.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5D91E3EF935A15755C0A96E948260|title=Antiques - A Proliferation Of Poster Art|date=1988-06-26|newspaper=The New York Times|last=Reif|first=Rita|accessdate=2008-11-19}}</ref> Another poster by Albert S\u00e9bille, showed the interior layout in a cutaway diagram 15 feet long.

While the French continued construction, the competing [[White Star Line]] ship (intended as [[Oceanic (unfinished ship)|''Oceanic'']], and started before the crash) was cancelled and Cunard's ''Queen Mary'' was put on hold.<ref name=cross269/> French builders also ran into difficulty and had to ask for government money; this subsidy was questioned in the press. Still, building was followed by newspapers and national interest was deep, as she was designed to represent France in the nation-state contest of the great liners and was built in a French shipyard using French parts.<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 269\u2013272</ref>\n\nThe growing hull in Saint-Nazaire had no formal designation except \"T-6\" (\"T\" for \"Transat\", an alternate name for the French Line, and \"6\" for \"6th\"), the contract name.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fvEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA881 \"T-6 The Latest Giant Of The Sea\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1932</ref> Many names were suggested including ''Doumer'', after [[Paul Doumer]], the recently assassinated [[President of France]]; and originally, ''La Belle France.''<ref name=cross272>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 272</ref> Finally ''Normandie'' was chosen. In France, boat prefixes properly depend on the boat name's gender, but non-sailors mostly use the masculine form,<ref name=cross272/> inherited from the French terms for boat, which can be \"paquebot\", \"navire\", \"bateau\", or \"b\u00e2timent\", but English speakers refer to boats as feminine (\"she's a beauty\"), and the French Line carried many rich American customers. French Line wrote that their boat was to be called simply \"''Normandie'',\" preceded by neither \"le\" nor \"la\" (French masculine/feminine for \"the\") to avoid any confusion.<ref name=cross273/>\n\n[[Image:Forme Joubert - porte et usine de pompage.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Louis Joubert Lock|''Normandie'' drydock in St. Nazaire]] which was built specifically for the new ship.]]\nOn 29 October 1932 \u2013 three years to the day after the [[stock market crash]] \u2013 ''Normandie'' was launched in front of 200,000 spectators.<ref name=cross275>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 275</ref> The 27,567-ton hull that slid into the [[Loire River]] was the largest launched and the wave crashed into a few hundred people, but with no injury.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 7, 17\u201320</ref> The boat was christened by Madame [[Marguerite Lebrun]], wife of [[Albert Lebrun]], the President of France. ''Normandie'' was [[fitting-out|outfitted]] until early 1935, her interiors, funnels, engines, and other fittings put in to make her into a working vessel. Finally, in May 1935, ''Normandie'' was ready for trials, which were watched by reporters.<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 281</ref> The superiority of Yourkevitch's hull was visible: hardly a wave was created off the bulbous bow. The ship reached a top speed of {{convert|32.125|kn|km/h}}<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 111</ref> and performed an emergency stop from that speed in {{convert|1,700|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}.\n\nIn addition to a novel hull which let her attain speed at far less power than other big liners,<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 171</ref> ''Normandie'' was filled with technical feats. She had [[turbo-electric transmission]], with turbo-generators and electric propulsion motors built by [[Alstom|Alsthom]] of [[Belfort]].<ref name=LR/> CGT chose turbo-electric transmission for the ability to use full power in reverse,<ref name=ardman46/> and because, according to CGT officials, it was quieter and more easily controlled and maintained.<ref name=ardman46/> The engine installation was heavier than conventional turbines and slightly less efficient at high speed but allowed all propellers to operate even if one engine was not running. This system also made it possible to eliminate astern turbines.<ref name=ardman46/> An early form of [[radar]] was installed to prevent collisions.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 160</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=x98DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA844 \"Radio Waves Warn of Obstacles in Path\" ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1935]</ref>\n\nThe rudder frame, including the 125-ton cast steel connecting rod, was produced by [[\u0160koda Works]] in [[Czechoslovakia]].\nA less known technical novelty was, for the inaugural Atlantic crossing, the testing of a \u201cradar\u201d then called \"Obstacle detector\" built by Henry Gutton (SFR). Coincidently, the US coastal Artillery had also used the ship to test the detection capability of a thermal \u201cradar,\u201d the SCR-263T.    \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Interior==\nThe luxurious interiors were designed in [[Art Deco|Art D\u00e9co]] and [[Streamline Moderne]] style. Many sculptures and wall paintings made allusions to [[Normandy]], the province of France for which ''Normandie'' was named.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 80</ref> Drawings and photographs show a series of vast public rooms of great elegance. ''Normandie'''s voluminous interior spaces were made possible by having the funnel intakes split to pass along the sides of the ship, rather than straight upward.<ref name=cross275/> French architect [[Roger-Henri Expert]] was in charge of the overall decorative scheme.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/17/arts/design/17anti.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Art Deco Relics of the ''Normandie'' |first=Wendy |last=Moonan |date=2005-06-17}}</ref>\n\nMost of the public space was devoted to first-class passengers, including the dining room, first-class lounge, grill room, first-class [[swimming pool]], [[theatre]] and [[winter garden]].

''Normandie'' also had indoor and outdoor pools, a chapel, and a theatre which could double as a stage and cinema.<ref name=cross276/><ref>Ardman 1985, p. 91\u201392</ref>\n\nThe machinery of the top deck and [[forecastle]] was integrated within the ship, concealing it and releasing nearly all the exposed deck space for passengers. As such it was the only ocean liner to have a regulation-sized open air [[tennis court]] on board.<ref>{{cite book|title=Luxury Liners Life on Board | author=Catherine Donzel |year=2006 | publisher=Harry Abrams | p=109\u201311}}</ref> The air conditioner units were concealed along with the kennels inside the third, dummy, funnel.<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 273\u201375</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[Image:SS Normandie Le Havre maiden voyage.jpg|thumb|''Normandie'' arrives for the first time at her home port of [[Le Havre, France]], at the start of her record-breaking [[maiden voyage]].]]\n''Normandie'''s [[maiden voyage]] was on 29 May 1935.

Cunard White Star said the ''Queen Mary'' would surpass 80,000 tons.<ref name=ardman166>Ardman 1985, p. 166\u2013170</ref> At 79,280 tons, ''Normandie'' would no longer be the world's largest.

Following these and other alterations, ''Normandie'' was 83,423 gross tons.<ref name=ardman166/> Exceeding the ''Queen Mary'' by 2,000 tons, she would soon become the world's largest in terms of overall measured gross tonnage and length once again, claiming it off the ''Queen Mary'' who only held it for a short amount of time.<ref name=ardman166/>\n\nOn 22 June 1936, a [[Blackburn Baffin]], [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|''S5162'']] of A Flight, [[HMS Sultan (establishment)|RAF Gosport]], flown by Lt Guy Kennedy Horsey on torpedo-dropping practice, buzzed ''Normandie'' a mile (2 km) off [[Ryde Pier]] and collided with a derrick which was transferring a motor car belonging to [[Arthur Evans (politician)|Arthur Evans]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]], onto a barge alongside the ship. The aircraft crashed onto ''Normandie{{'}}''s bow. The pilot was taken off by tender, but the wreckage of the aircraft remained on board ''Normandie'' as she had to sail due to the tide.

Her three-bladed screws were replaced with four-bladed ones, and structural modifications were made to her lower aft section. These modifications reduced vibration at speed.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 172\u201373</ref><ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 286\u201387</ref> In July 1937 ''Normandie'' regained the Blue Riband, but the ''Queen Mary'' took it back next year. After this the captain of ''Normandie'' sent a message saying \"Bravo to the ''Queen Mary'' until next time!\" This rivalry could have gone on into the 1940s, but was ended by [[World War II]].\n\n''Normandie'' carried distinguished passengers, including the authors [[Colette]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]];<ref name=Ardman325>Ardman 1985, p. 325\u201326</ref> the wife of French President [[Albert Lebrun]];<ref name=cross284/> songwriters [[No\u00ebl Coward]] and [[Irving Berlin]]; and Hollywood celebrities such as [[Fred Astaire]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr]], and [[James Stewart]].<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 147, 184\u201385, 205, 218, 238</ref> ''Normandie'' also carried the [[Georg Ludwig von Trapp|von Trapp family singers]] of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' from New York to Southampton in 1938, and from Southampton, the family went to Scandinavia for a tour before returning to America.\n\n==Planned running mate - SS ''Bretagne''==\nWhile ''Normandie'' rarely was occupied at over 60% of her capacity, her finances were such that she did not require government subsidies every year. She never repaid any of the loans that made her construction possible. The French Line considered a sister ship, SS ''Bretagne'', which was to be longer and larger. There were two competing designs for this ship, one conservative, one radical. The conservative one was essentially ''Normandie'' with two funnels, possibly larger as well. The radical one was from ''Normandie''{{'}}s designer, Vladimir Yourkevitch, and was super-streamlined with twin, side-by-side funnels just aft of the bridge. The more conservative design won, but the outbreak of [[World War II]] halted the plan indefinitely.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 237, 423</ref><ref>Williams, David L., and De Kerbrech, R. P. ''Damned by Destiny''. 1982</ref>\n\n==Popularity==\nAlthough ''Normandie'' was a critical success in her design and decor, ultimately North Atlantic passengers flocked to the more traditional ''Queen Mary''. Two of the ship's greatest attributes, in reality, turned out to be two of her biggest faults.\n\n[[File:Jeton du paquebot Normandie, 1930-1940.jpg|thumb|''Normandie'' depicted on a token]]\n[[File:Luftaufnahme der Normandie.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Overhead view of ''Normandie'' at sea]]\nPart of the ship's problem lay in the fact that the majority of her passenger space was devoted solely to first class, which could carry up to 848 people. Less space and consideration were given to second and tourist class, which numbered only 670 and 454 passengers respectively. As a result, the consensus among North Atlantic passengers was that she was primarily a ship for the rich and famous. In contrast, in ''Queen Mary'', Cunard  White Star had placed just as much emphasis on decor, space, and accommodation in second and tourist class as in first class. Thus ''Queen Mary'' accommodated American tourists, who had become numerous in the 1920s and the 1930s. Many of these passengers could not afford first-class passage, yet wanted to travel with much of the same comfort as those experienced in first. As a result, second and tourist class became a major cash source for shipping companies at that time. ''Queen Mary'' would accommodate these trends and subsequently the liner achieved greater popularity among North Atlantic travellers during the late thirties.<ref name=\"thegreatoceanliners.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreatoceanliners.com/normandie2.html|title=TGOL - Normandie|website=www.thegreatoceanliners.com}}</ref>\n\nAnother of the French Liner's greatest triumphs also turned out to be one of her greatest flaws: her decor. ''Normandie''{{'}}s slick and modern art deco interiors proved to be somewhat intimidating and uncomfortable for her travellers. It was also here that ''Queen Mary'' triumphed over her French rival. Although also decorated in an art deco style, ''Queen Mary'' was more restrained in her appointments and was not as radical as ''Normandie'', and proved ultimately to be more popular with  travellers.<ref name=\"thegreatoceanliners.com\"/>\n\n[[File:SS Normandie in NYC Harbor at Pier.jpg|thumb|''Normandie'' at C.G.T.'s pier 88 in New York]]\nAs a result, ''Normandie'' at many times throughout her service history carried less than half her full complement of passengers. Her German rivals {{SS|Bremen|1929|2}} and {{SS|Europa|1928|2}}, and Italian rivals {{SS|Rex||2}} and {{SS|Conte di Savoia||2}} also suffered from this problem; despite their innovative designs and luxurious interiors, they made little profit for their respective companies. Contributing to this were international boycotts against Germany after 1933 and the same with Italy in the late 1930s as the European geo-political situation deteriorated. The Italian liners were relying heavily on government subsidies, while the German Lloyd liners never received funding. In comparison, ''Normandie'' did not require government subsidies in service, with her income covering not only her operating expenses, but generating revenue of 158,000,000 francs.\n\nIn contrast, Cunard White Star's ''Britannic III'', ''Georgic II'', and much older ''Aquitania'', along with the [[Holland America Line]]'s {{SS|Nieuw Amsterdam|1937|3=6}}, were among the few North Atlantic liners to make a profit, carrying the lion's share of passengers in the years preceding [[World War II]]. ''Queen Mary'', as ''Mauretania II'' earned only after WWII real profits.\n\n==World War II==\nThe outbreak of the war found ''Normandie'' in New York harbor. Looming hostilities in Europe had compelled ''Normandie'' to seek haven there. The U.S. government [[Internment|interned]] her on 3 September 1939, the same day [[France]] declared war on [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Soon the ''Queen Mary'', later refitted as a troop ship, moored\nnearby. Then, 2 weeks later, {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} joined the ''Queen Mary''. For 5 months, the three largest liners in the world were tied up side by side.<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 360\u201361</ref> ''Normandie'' remained in French hands, with French crewmembers on board, led by Captain Herv\u00e9 Lehu\u00e9d\u00e9, into the spring of 1940.\n\nOn 15 May 1940, during the [[battle of France]], the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] detailed about 150 Coast Guardsmen to go on board the ship and Pier&nbsp;88 to defend it against possible [[sabotage]].  (Under then-current U.S. law, the U.S. Coast Guard was a part of the Treasury during peacetime.)  When the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] (USCG) became a part of the Navy on 1 November 1941, ''Normandie''{{'}}s USCG detail remained intact, mainly observing while the French crew maintained the vessel's boilers, machinery, and other equipment, including the fire-watch system. On 12 December 1941, five days after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the Coast Guard removed Captain Lehu\u00e9d\u00e9 and his crew and took possession of the ''Normandie'' under the right of [[angary]], maintaining steam in the boilers and other activities on the idled vessel. However, the elaborate fire-watch system which ensured that any fire would be suppressed before it became a danger was abandoned.<ref>Braynard, Frank O.

Roosevelt]]'s approval of ''Normandie'''s transfer to the U.S. Navy. Plans called for the vessel to be turned into a [[troopship]] (\"convoy unit loaded transport\"). The Navy renamed her USS ''Lafayette'', in honor both of [[Marquis de la Fayette]], the French general who fought on the [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonies]]' behalf in the [[American Revolution]], and the alliance with France that made American independence possible. The name was a suggestion of J.P. \"Jim\" Warburg, advisory assistant to Colonel [[William J. Donovan]], [[Coordinator of Information]], which was passed through multiple channels including the [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Frank Knox]], Admiral [[Harold R. Stark]], [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO), and Rear Adm. Randall Jacobs, Chief of the [[Bureau of Navigation]]; the name ''La Fayette'' (later universally and unofficially contracted to ''Lafayette'') was officially approved by the Secretary of the Navy on 31 December 1941, with the vessel classified as a transport, AP-53.\n\nEarlier proposals included turning the vessel into an aircraft carrier, but this was dropped in favor of immediate troop transport.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 274\u2013276</ref> The ship remained moored at Manhattan's [[New York Passenger Ship Terminal|Pier 88]] for the conversion. A contract for her conversion to a troop transport was awarded to Robins Dry Dock and Repair Co., a subsidiary of [[Vigor Shipyards|Todd Shipyards]], on 27 December 1941. On that date, Capt. Clayton M. Simmers, the 3rd Naval District Materiel Officer, reported to the Bureau of Ships (BuShips) his estimate that the conversion work could be completed by 31 January 1942, and planning for the work proceeded on that basis.\n\nCapt. Robert G. Coman reported as ''Lafayette'''s prospective commanding officer on 31 January 1942, overseeing a skeleton engineering force numbering 458 men. The complicated nature and enormous size of the conversion effort prevented Coman's crew from adhering to the original schedule; crew familiarization with the vessel was an issue, and additional crew members were arriving to assist the effort. On 6 February 1942, a request for a two-week delay for the first sailing of ''Lafayette'', originally scheduled for 14 February, was submitted to the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations. On that day, a schedule extension was granted due to a design plan change: elements of the superstructure were to be removed to improve stability, in work that was expected to take another 60 to 90 days. However, on 7 February, orders came from Washington that the reduction of the top-hamper had been abandoned and ''Lafayette'' was to sail on 14 February as planned. This abrupt reversal necessitated a frantic resumption of conversion work, and Capts Coman and Simmers scheduled 9 February{{clarify|date=December 2012}} meetings in New York and Washington to lobby for further clarification of conversion plans; ultimately, these meetings would never take place.\n\n===Fire and Capsizing===\n[[Image:Normandie fire.jpg|thumb|''Lafayette'' (AP-53) afire at New York harbor on 9 February 1942]]\nAt 14:30 on 9 February 1942, sparks from a welding torch used by Clement Derrick ignited a stack of life vests filled with flammable [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]] that had been stored in the first-class lounge.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 299</ref><ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 367\u201368</ref> The woodwork had not yet been removed, and the fire spread rapidly. The ship had a very efficient fire protection system, but it had been disconnected during the conversion and its internal pumping system was deactivated.<ref>Ardman 1985, p. 272, 304\u201314</ref> The New York City fire department's hoses, unfortunately, did not fit the ship's French inlets. Before the fire department arrived, approximately 15 minutes after fire broke out, all onboard crew were using manual means in a vain attempt to stop the blaze. A strong northwesterly wind blowing over ''Lafayette'''s port quarter swept the blaze forward, eventually involving the three upper decks of the ship within an hour of the start of the conflagration. Capt. Coman, along with Capt. Simmers, arrived about 15:25 to see his huge prospective command in flames.\n\n[[File:Normandie capsized (LIFE).jpg|left|thumb|USS ''Lafayette'' capsized in New York harbor.]]\nAs firefighters on shore and in fire boats poured water on the blaze, the ship developed a dangerous list to port due to water pumped into the seaward side by fireboats. The ship's designer [[Vladimir Yourkevitch]] arrived at the scene to offer expertise, but he was barred by harbor police.<ref name=Ardman325/><ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 373\u201374</ref> His suggestion was to enter the vessel and open the sea-cocks. This would flood the lower decks and make her settle the few feet to the bottom. With the ship stabilised, water could be pumped into burning areas without the risk of capsize. The suggestion was rejected by the commander of the [[3rd Naval District]], Rear Admiral [[Adolphus Andrews]].\n\nBetween 17:45 and 18:00 on 9 February 1942, authorities considered the fire under control, and began winding down operations until 20:00. Water entering the ship through submerged openings and flowing to the lower decks negated efforts to counter-flood, and ''Lafayette'''s list gradually increased to port. Shortly after midnight, Rear Adm. Andrews ordered ''Lafayette'' abandoned, and the ship continued to list, a process hastened by the 6,000 tons of water that had been sprayed on her. New York fire officials were concerned that the fire could spread to the nearby city buildings. ''Lafayette'' eventually [[capsize]]d during the mid watch (02:45) on 10 February, nearly crushing a fire boat, and came to rest on her port side at an angle of approximately 80 degrees. Recognising that his incompetence had caused the disaster, Admiral Andrews ordered all pressmen barred from viewing the moment of capsize in an effort to lower the level of publicity.<ref>History of the Normandie, Frank O Braynard (1987), Dover Publications 0-486-25257-4 p. 97</ref>\n\n[[Image:USS Lafayette 1942.jpg|thumb|''Normandie'', renamed USS ''Lafayette'', lies capsized in the frozen mud of her New York pier in the winter of 1942]]\nOne man died in the tragedy \u2014 Frank \"Trent\" Trentacosta, 36, of Brooklyn, a Robins' employee and a member of the fire watch. Some 94 USCG and USN sailors, including some from ''Lafayette'''s pre-commissioning crew and men assigned to the receiving ship ''[[USS Washington (ACR-11)|Seattle]]'', 38 fire fighters, and 153 civilians were treated for various injuries, burns, smoke inhalation, and exposure.\n\n====''Saboteur'' (film)====\n\nThe ruined ''Lafayette'' after the fire can be seen briefly in the film ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942). The ship is not identified in the film, but the antagonist smiles when he sees it, suggesting that he was responsible. [[Alfred Hitchcock]], the director, later said that \"the Navy raised hell\" about the implication that their security was so poor.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book |last=Spoto |first=Donald |authorlink=Donald Spoto |title=The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock |publisher=Da Capo |year=1999 |isbn=0-306-80932-X |page=[https://archive.org/details/darksideofgenius00spot_0/page/253 253] |url=https://archive.org/details/darksideofgenius00spot_0/page/253 }}</ref> The [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]] of the US was being attacked by German U-boats at the time but information was suppressed by the Navy.

The alleged arson would have been organized by mobster [[Anthony Anastasio]], who was a power in the local longshoremen's union, for the purpose of providing a pretext for the release from prison of mob boss [[Charles Luciano|Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano]]. Luciano's end of the bargain would be that he would ensure that there would be no further \"enemy\" sabotage in the ports where the mob had strong influence with the unions.<ref>The evidence that the fire was caused by arson comes from [[Meyer Lansky]] and Luciano themselves.

Extensive damage to her hull, however, deterioration of her machinery, and the necessity for employing manpower on other more critical war projects prevented resumption of the conversion program, with the cost of restoring her determined to be too great, and her hulk remained in the Navy's custody through the cessation of hostilities with the [[Axis powers]].\n\n''Lafayette'' was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 11 October 1945 without having ever sailed under the US flag. President [[Harry Truman]] authorized her disposal in an Executive Order on 8 September 1946, and she was sold as scrap on 3 October 1946 to Lipsett, Inc., an American [[Marine salvage|salvage]] company based in New York City, for [[United States dollar|US$]]161,680 (approx. $1,997,000 in 2017 value). After neither the U.S. Navy nor French Line offered a plan to salvage her, Yourkevitch, the ship's original designer, proposed to cut the ship down and restore her as a mid-sized liner.<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 392</ref> This plan also failed to draw backing. She was cut up for scrap beginning in October 1946<ref name=cross391/> at [[Port Newark, New Jersey]], and completely scrapped by 31 December 1948.\n\n==Legacy==\nDesigner Marin-Marie gave an innovative line to ''Normandie'', a silhouette which influenced ocean liners over the decades, including ''[[Queen Mary 2]]''. The ambience of classic transatlantic liners like ''Normandie'' (and her chief rival, ''Queen Mary'') was the source of inspiration for [[Disney Cruise Line]]'s matching vessels, ''[[Disney Magic]],'' ''[[Disney Wonder]]'', ''[[Disney Dream]]'', and ''[[Disney Fantasy]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.britishdesigninnovation.org/index.php?page=newsservice/view&news_id=2431 |title=Imagination Creates Atmosphere On Disney Wonder, UK |date=2003-05-27 |publisher=British Design Innovation |accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:San Juan, PR 05.jpg|thumb|The [[Normandie Hotel]] in San Juan, Puerto Rico]]\n''Normandie'' also inspired the architecture and design of the [[Normandie Hotel]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. The hotel's roof sign is one of the two signs that adorned the top deck of the ''Normandie'' but were removed from it during an early refitting. It also inspired the nickname 'The Normandie' given to the [[Wukang Mansion|International Savings Society Apartments]] in Shanghai, one of the most fashionable residential buildings during the city's pre-revolutionary heyday and home to several stars of China's mid-20th century film industry.\n\nItems from ''Normandie'' were sold at a series of auctions after her demise,<ref name=Ardman418>Ardman 1985, p. 418\u201320</ref> and many pieces are considered valuable [[Art Deco]] treasures today.

It was first displayed outside in the [[parterre]] gardens near the formal pool and later indoors near the then Fontainebleau Hilton's spa.

In addition, it consistently presented issues of the day as problems due to competition with free blacks, projecting threats to white men's power and forecasting worse labor problems if the mass of slaves were freed. On March 1863, a [[Detroit race riot of 1863|race riot]] broke out in Detroit. Catalyzed by the arrest of a [[mixed-race]] man for allegedly molesting a white girl, a white mob attacked blacks and their neighborhood, resulting in two deaths (one, white and one black), numerous people injured, 35 houses and businesses destroyed, and more than 200 people left homeless.

In 1935, the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Act]] (FHLB) commissioned 239 lending maps for the [[Federal Housing Authority|Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation|Home Owners Loan Corporation]] (HOLC) to document and evaluate what neighborhoods throughout the country were lending risks. Many areas of Detroit were [[Redlining|redlined]] as a result of being designated \"high risk\" neighborhoods. Neighborhoods that were graded as hazardous for lending were primarily composed of minority groups, and these redlined neighborhoods illustrated the ways in which economic inequality disproportionately targeted African Americans. Citizens residing in these neighborhoods were denied loans by lending institutions, and consequently they were unable to purchase or fix homes. Since black individuals were not able to leave their impoverished neighborhoods and were not able to improve their homes through loans, the concentration of poverty within black bottom increased.<ref name=\"Sugrue, Thomas J. 1996 p. 43\">[Sugrue, Thomas J.

Racial covenants were legally bound contracts that outlawed the residency of African Americans within a given area.<ref>[https://www.naacpldf.org/files/our-work/Detroit%20Housing%20Discrimination.pdf \"Detroit Housing Discrimination\"]</ref> By 1940, 80% of Detroit's residencies abided by racial covenants, and thereby restricted black housing to historically impoverished and dangerous areas on the basis of race.<ref name=\"Sugrue, Thomas J. 1996 p. 43\"/> Though the use of redlining and racial covenants contributed to segregation within housing for African Americans, African Americans were displaced from their homes through urban redevelopment. In efforts to improve the city's conditions, highways, hospitals and apartment buildings were set to be created by removing and eradicating Detroit's \"slums\" that were located in black communities by the Detroit City Planning Commission (CPC).<ref>[Sugrue, Thomas J.

The CPC subsequently failed to provide adequate resources for relocation to the black families whose homes and neighborhoods were destroyed.<ref>[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996).

Systematic discrimination in housing contributed to volatile race relations in the city of Detroit.\n\nThe most important pro-public housing coalition was the [[Citizens Housing and Planning Council|Citizens' Housing and Planning Council]] (CHPC).

This reform aimed to ameliorate poor living spaces and construct a cleaner environment that was more conducive to public health and morale.<ref name=\":0\" /> This organization inevitably faced opposition from anti-public housing groups and white homeowners who were fixated on maintaining racial homogeneity in their neighborhoods.\n\nAfter the decision of Shelly v.

Historians have previously connected homeowners associations\u2019 efforts to prevent integration to be tied to the sense of identity within the segregated neighborhoods in Detroit.<ref name=\"Sugrue, Thomas J. 1996 p. 214\"/> Since the housing shortage affected both white and black populations, people clung onto aspects of their community for the feeling of security within housing.<ref name=\"Sugrue, Thomas J. 1996 p. 214\"/> Segregated Detroit neighborhoods facilitated for this feeling of safety and stability to then be linked to race. Once this sentiment of safety was threatened with integration of black residents who have been construed as dangerous and inhumane, the agency of white homeowners associations was actualized.\n\n==== 1943 Riot ====\nPostwar tensions and animosities culminated in the [[1943 Detroit race riot|race riots of 1943]]. This riot started with a conflict among young men at Belle Isle, and it quickly spread into the city, inciting violence between whites and blacks. Although at the time blacks were largely blamed for the violence, studies have found that many young armed whites traveled across the city to attack majority-black areas east of Woodward Avenue. By contrast, blacks arrested in the riot tended to be mature family men who had lived longer in the city and were defending their homes. The riot ended when 6,000 soldiers of the [[United States Army]] intervened to keep the peace and order in the city. As a result of this riot, white citizens learned to use violence to gain leverage in political and housing contentions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Civil Rights Movement ====\nThe civil rights movement in the South affected minorities in northern and western states as well. In Detroit, activists pushed for more representation in local government, including the white-dominated police force, and for equal justice in housing and employment. At the same time, African Americans were proud of their progress in Detroit. In 1965 the [[Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History]] was founded in the city.\n\nAccording to columnist [[Keith Richburg]], in the 1960s a social divide developed between the many black people from Alabama and those from South Carolina; they lived east and west of [[Woodward Avenue (Michigan)|Woodward Avenue]], respectively. The migrants from South Carolina believed they were more refined than those from Alabama, who were from rural areas and thought to be lower class. Richburg described the divide as \"more psychological than geographic\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Richburg, Keith|authorlink=Keith Richburg|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/richburg/richbrg1.htm|title=American in Africa|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=1995-03-16<!--Sunday-->|accessdate=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1950 to 1970 ''de facto'' racial segregation in the Metro Detroit area increased. Those white people who were more established economically moved out of the city to newly developed suburbs, which often were divided by class and income levels. In that period black growth in the suburbs averaged 2.7%, while in previous decades it had been 5%.<ref name=MetzgerBoozaAAp10/> Social tensions increased as blacks felt oppressed by discrimination, a majority-white police force, and restricted housing. Resentments erupted in the widespread destruction and violence in black neighborhoods of the [[Detroit riot of 1967]], considered the worst in urban America. That summer similar riots erupted in numerous cities across the country. Both middle-class whites and blacks began to leave Detroit in greater number. Following the assassination of Dr. [[Martin Luther King]] in April 1968, there was [[1968 Detroit riot|renewed violence]] in a civil disturbance along 12th Street, the center of the 1967 unrest. It was quickly controlled. In the 1970s, the number of middle-class blacks moving to the suburbs increased, as they also sought newer housing, better schools, and neighborhoods with less poverty and crime.<ref name=MetzgerBoozaAAp8/>\n\n==== Auto Industry ====\nPressures on the auto industry and restructuring of heavy manufacturing across the region caused high job losses, adding to the strains of the city. Overall population in the metro area declined, with many people moving to other areas for work. Detroit suffered concentrated poverty in sections, where people were unable to leave. The quality of schools declined, creating a cycle that appeared to trap people in place. The city struggled to support those in need at a time of declining revenues.\n\n==== Demographic Changes and Suburbanization ====\nBy 1970 Detroit and six other municipalities, [[Ecorse, Michigan|Ecorse]], Highland Park, Inkster, [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], [[River Rouge, Michigan|River Rouge]], and [[Royal Oak Charter Township, Michigan|Royal Oak Township]], had higher than average <!-- what does that mean? majority black, or compared to some national average? and that is what?-->black populations.

In 1935, the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Act]] (FHLB) commissioned 239 lending maps for the [[Federal Housing Authority|Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation|Home Owners Loan Corporation]] (HOLC) to document and evaluate what neighborhoods throughout the country were lending risks. Many areas of Detroit were [[Redlining|redlined]] as a result of being designated \"high risk\" neighborhoods. Neighborhoods that were graded as hazardous for lending were primarily composed of minority groups, and these redlined neighborhoods illustrated the ways in which economic inequality disproportionately targeted African Americans. Citizens residing in these neighborhoods were denied loans by lending institutions, and consequently they were unable to purchase or fix homes. Since black individuals were not able to leave their impoverished neighborhoods and were not able to improve their homes through loans, the concentration of poverty within black bottom increased.<ref name=\"Sugrue, Thomas J. 1996 p. 43\">[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 43. {{ISBN|978-0-691-12186-4}}.]</ref> Such policies worsen the condition of black housing solely on the basis of race.<ref name=\"Sugrue, Thomas J. 1996 p. 34\"/> The lack of mobility for black people reaffirmed stereotypes white communities held about the moral integrity of black neighborhoods because of the destitute conditions black communities were stuck in.\n\nFederal policies further exacerbated segregation through the use of racial covenants within the city. Racial covenants were legally bound contracts that outlawed the residency of African Americans within a given area.<ref>[https://www.naacpldf.org/files/our-work/Detroit%20Housing%20Discrimination.pdf \"Detroit Housing Discrimination\"]</ref> By 1940, 80% of Detroit's residencies abided by racial covenants, and thereby restricted black housing to historically impoverished and dangerous areas on the basis of race.<ref name=\"Sugrue, Thomas J. 1996 p. 43\"/> Though the use of redlining and racial covenants contributed to segregation within housing for African Americans, African Americans were displaced from their homes through urban redevelopment. In efforts to improve the city's conditions, highways, hospitals and apartment buildings were set to be created by removing and eradicating Detroit's \"slums\" that were located in black communities by the Detroit City Planning Commission (CPC).<ref>[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 49. {{ISBN|978-0-691-12186-4}}.]</ref> Having Detroit's city leadership in the 1940s and 1950s attribute redevelopment and renovation with destroying \"dangerous\" parts of the city made black bottom especially vulnerable to displacement. The CPC subsequently failed to provide adequate resources for relocation to the black families whose homes and neighborhoods were destroyed.<ref>[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 50. {{ISBN|978-0-691-12186-4}}.]</ref> The disappearance of culture is a by-product of this policy, since the displacement of black families eventually brought with it a disappearance of black culture and tradition. Systematic discrimination in housing contributed to volatile race relations in the city of Detroit.\n\nThe most important pro-public housing coalition was the [[Citizens Housing and Planning Council|Citizens' Housing and Planning Council]] (CHPC). The goal of this organization was to improve environmental conditions in slums by replacing suboptimal living and sanitary conditions with more adequate housing for African Americans. This reform aimed to ameliorate poor living spaces and construct a cleaner environment that was more conducive to public health and morale.<ref name=\":0\" /> This organization inevitably faced opposition from anti-public housing groups and white homeowners who were fixated on maintaining racial homogeneity in their neighborhoods.\n\nAfter the decision of Shelly v. Kramer banned racial covenants, efforts to keep neighborhoods segregated were propelled by Homeowners associations.<ref>[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996).

Through the use of mutual reciprocal legal agreements, homeowners associations maintained racially specific language to bar black people from obtaining loans in white populated areas.<ref>[Sugrue, Thomas J.

Associations such as the Plymouth Manor association required its members to only contract with approved real estate brokers that would guarantee that loans and property would only be sold to white individuals.<ref name=\"Sugrue, Thomas J. 1996 p. 222\">[Sugrue, Thomas J.

Cobo opted to have several members of homeowners associations counsel zoning and urban development policies which attempted to further enforce de facto segregation within Detroit.<ref name=\"Sugrue, Thomas J. 1996 p. 222\"/> The influence of homeowners associations within the Cobo administration stretched as far as playing an integral role in disbanding the Mayor's Interacial Committee (MIC) which was aimed at facilitating integration within the city, and turning it into the Commission on Community Relations (CCR). The CCR was composed of homeowners association members and perpetuated segregated housing standards by emphasizing rights that belong to white homeowners to resist integration throughout the city.<ref>[Sugrue, Thomas J. (1996). The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. 41 William Street, Princeton, New Jersey 08540: Princeton University Press. p. 225. {{ISBN|978-0-691-12186-4}}]</ref> Racism within housing was therefore still intact after it was federally banned through these extralegal loopholes that were spearheaded by white homeowners associations. \nThe actions of the homeowners associations reflected the deep cultural ties that Detroiters developed within their neighborhoods. Historians have previously connected homeowners associations\u2019 efforts to prevent integration to be tied to the sense of identity within the segregated neighborhoods in Detroit.<ref name=\"Sugrue, Thomas J. 1996 p. 214\"/> Since the housing shortage affected both white and black populations, people clung onto aspects of their community for the feeling of security within housing.<ref name=\"Sugrue, Thomas J. 1996 p. 214\"/> Segregated Detroit neighborhoods facilitated for this feeling of safety and stability to then be linked to race. Once this sentiment of safety was threatened with integration of black residents who have been construed as dangerous and inhumane, the agency of white homeowners associations was actualized.\n\n==== 1943 Riot ====\nPostwar tensions and animosities culminated in the [[1943 Detroit race riot|race riots of 1943]]. This riot started with a conflict among young men at Belle Isle, and it quickly spread into the city, inciting violence between whites and blacks. Although at the time blacks were largely blamed for the violence, studies have found that many young armed whites traveled across the city to attack majority-black areas east of Woodward Avenue. By contrast, blacks arrested in the riot tended to be mature family men who had lived longer in the city and were defending their homes. The riot ended when 6,000 soldiers of the [[United States Army]] intervened to keep the peace and order in the city. As a result of this riot, white citizens learned to use violence to gain leverage in political and housing contentions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Civil Rights Movement ====\nThe civil rights movement in the South affected minorities in northern and western states as well. In Detroit, activists pushed for more representation in local government, including the white-dominated police force, and for equal justice in housing and employment. At the same time, African Americans were proud of their progress in Detroit. In 1965 the [[Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History]] was founded in the city.\n\nAccording to columnist [[Keith Richburg]], in the 1960s a social divide developed between the many black people from Alabama and those from South Carolina; they lived east and west of [[Woodward Avenue (Michigan)|Woodward Avenue]], respectively. The migrants from South Carolina believed they were more refined than those from Alabama, who were from rural areas and thought to be lower class. Richburg described the divide as \"more psychological than geographic\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Richburg, Keith|authorlink=Keith Richburg|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/richburg/richbrg1.htm|title=American in Africa|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=1995-03-16<!--Sunday-->|accessdate=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1950 to 1970 ''de facto'' racial segregation in the Metro Detroit area increased. Those white people who were more established economically moved out of the city to newly developed suburbs, which often were divided by class and income levels. In that period black growth in the suburbs averaged 2.7%, while in previous decades it had been 5%.<ref name=MetzgerBoozaAAp10/> Social tensions increased as blacks felt oppressed by discrimination, a majority-white police force, and restricted housing. Resentments erupted in the widespread destruction and violence in black neighborhoods of the [[Detroit riot of 1967]], considered the worst in urban America. That summer similar riots erupted in numerous cities across the country. Both middle-class whites and blacks began to leave Detroit in greater number. Following the assassination of Dr. [[Martin Luther King]] in April 1968, there was [[1968 Detroit riot|renewed violence]] in a civil disturbance along 12th Street, the center of the 1967 unrest. It was quickly controlled. In the 1970s, the number of middle-class blacks moving to the suburbs increased, as they also sought newer housing, better schools, and neighborhoods with less poverty and crime.<ref name=MetzgerBoozaAAp8/>\n\n==== Auto Industry ====\nPressures on the auto industry and restructuring of heavy manufacturing across the region caused high job losses, adding to the strains of the city. Overall population in the metro area declined, with many people moving to other areas for work. Detroit suffered concentrated poverty in sections, where people were unable to leave. The quality of schools declined, creating a cycle that appeared to trap people in place. The city struggled to support those in need at a time of declining revenues.\n\n==== Demographic Changes and Suburbanization ====\nBy 1970 Detroit and six other municipalities, [[Ecorse, Michigan|Ecorse]], Highland Park, Inkster, [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], [[River Rouge, Michigan|River Rouge]], and [[Royal Oak Charter Township, Michigan|Royal Oak Township]], had higher than average <!-- what does that mean? majority black, or compared to some national average? and that is what?-->black populations. The six suburban municipalities with higher than average black populations held a total of 78.5% of the suburban black people in the tri-county area.<ref name=\"MetzgerBoozaAAp11\">Metzger, Kurt and Jason Booza. \"[http://www.cus.wayne.edu/content/publications/AAwork8.pdf African Americans in the United States, Michigan and Metropolitan Detroit] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6KzklwzgL?url=http://www.cus.wayne.edu/content/publications/AAwork8.pdf |date=2013-11-09 }}.\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6KzklwzgL?url=http://www.cus.wayne.edu/content/publications/AAwork8.pdf Archive]) Center for Urban Studies, [[Wayne State University]].
