Pictures]].<ref name=\"BOM\" /> It is based on [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|1997 novel of the same name]]. The film is the first instalment<!-- British English \"instalment\", not US \"installment\"--> of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]] and was written by [[Steve Kloves]] and produced by [[David Heyman]]. Its story follows [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]'s first year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as he discovers that he is a famous wizard and begins his education. The film stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], with [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]], and [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]].\n\nWarner Bros. bought the film rights to the book in 1999 for a reported \u00a31 million ($1.65 million in 1999). Production began in the United Kingdom in 2000, with Chris Columbus being chosen to create the film from a short list of directors that included [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Rob Reiner]]. Rowling insisted that the entire cast be British and Irish, and the film was shot at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]] and historic buildings around the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film was released to cinemas in the United Kingdom and United States on 16 November 2001. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $975.8 million at the box office worldwide.

Ten years later, Harry has been battling a disjointed life with the Dursleys. After inadvertently causing an accident during a family trip to the zoo, Harry begins receiving unsolicited letters by owls. After the Dursleys escape to an island to avoid more letters, Hagrid re-appears and informs Harry that he is actually a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts against the Dursleys' wishes. After taking Harry to [[Diagon Alley]] to buy his supplies for Hogwarts and a pet owl named Hedwig as a birthday present, Hagrid informs him of his past: Harry's parents [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|James and Lily Potter]] met their demise via a [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Killing Curse]] at the hands of the malevolent and all-powerful wizard: [[Lord Voldemort]]. Harry, the only survivor in the chaos, thus becomes well-known in the wizarding world as \"The Boy Who Lived\".\n\nHarry is then taken to [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] to board a train to Hogwarts, where he meets three other students: [[Ron Weasley]], whom he quickly befriends; [[Hermione Granger]], an intelligent witch born to [[Muggle]] parents; and [[Draco Malfoy]], a boy from a wealthy wizarding family, with whom he immediately clashes. After arriving at school the students assemble in the Great Hall, where all the first-years are sorted by the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] among four houses: [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], [[Ravenclaw]], and [[Slytherin]]. Although the Sorting Hat considers putting Harry in Slytherin with Draco, he is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione.\n\nAt Hogwarts, Harry begins learning magic spells and discovers more about his past and parents. After recovering the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Remembrall|Remembrall]] of Gryffindor student [[Neville Longbottom]], Harry is recruited for Gryffindor's [[Quidditch]] team as a Seeker, an extremely rare feat for first-year students. On their way to the dorms one night the stair cases change paths leading Harry, Ron, and Hermione to the forbidden floor of Hogwarts. The three discover a [[Cerberus|giant three-headed dog]] named Fluffy in a restricted area of the school. Ron then insults Hermione after being embarrassed by her in a charms lesson, causing Hermione to lock herself in the girls' bathroom. She is attacked by a marauding troll, but Harry and Ron save her, befriending her in the process.\n\nThe children later find out Fluffy is guarding the [[Philosopher's Stone]], an object that has the power to turn any metal into [[gold]] and produce a [[elixir of life|potion that grants immortality]]. Harry suspects that Potions teacher and head of Slytherin House [[Severus Snape]] is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort to physical form. Hagrid accidentally reveals to the trio that Fluffy will fall asleep if played music. Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide that night to try and find the stone before Snape. They discover an already asleep Fluffy and face a series of safeguards including a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys that bruise Harry, and a dangerous life-sized game of [[chess]] that almost kills Ron.\n\nAfter getting past the tasks, Harry discovers that it was [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher [[Quirinus Quirrell]] who was trying to claim the stone: Snape had actually been protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weak Voldemort living on the back of his head. Through an enchantment placed by Dumbledore, Harry finds the stone in his possession. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for reviving his parents, but Harry refuses. Quirrell attempts to kill Harry in response; however, he is instead killed after Harry ends up burning his skin, reducing Quirrell to dust and causing Voldemort's soul to rise from his ashes. Harry is knocked unconscious in the process.\n\nHarry recovers in the school hospital with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are safe. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrell: When Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, tying them for first place with Slytherin.

The book's first chapter is from the viewpoint of Vernon and Petunia Dursley the day before they are given Harry to look after, highlighting how non-magical people react to magic. The film removes this, beginning with Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hagrid leaving Harry with the Dursleys (although McGonagall tells Dumbledore how she had been watching the Dursleys all day). Harry's less than pleasant times at Mrs. Figg's are cut from the film while the [[boa constrictor]] from Brazil in the zoo becomes a [[Burmese Python]] in the film.

Some of [[Nicolas Flamel#In popular culture|Nicolas Flamel]]'s role is changed or cut altogether. [[Rubeus Hagrid#Norbert|Norbert]] is mentioned to have been taken away by Dumbledore in the film; whilst the book sees Harry and Hermione have to take him by hand to [[Charlie Weasley]]'s friends.

Pictures]].<ref name=\"BOM\" /> It is based on [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|1997 novel of the same name]]. The film is the first instalment<!-- British English \"instalment\", not US \"installment\"--> of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]] and was written by [[Steve Kloves]] and produced by [[David Heyman]]. Its story follows [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]'s first year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as he discovers that he is a famous wizard and begins his education. The film stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], with [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]], and [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]].\n\nWarner Bros. bought the film rights to the book in 1999 for a reported \u00a31 million ($1.65 million in 1999). Production began in the United Kingdom in 2000, with Chris Columbus being chosen to create the film from a short list of directors that included [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Rob Reiner]]. Rowling insisted that the entire cast be British and Irish, and the film was shot at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]] and historic buildings around the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film was released to cinemas in the United Kingdom and United States on 16 November 2001. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $975.8 million at the box office worldwide.

Ten years later, Harry has been battling a disjointed life with the Dursleys. After inadvertently causing an accident during a family trip to the zoo, Harry begins receiving unsolicited letters by owls. After the Dursleys escape to an island to avoid more letters, Hagrid re-appears and informs Harry that he is actually a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts against the Dursleys' wishes. After taking Harry to [[Diagon Alley]] to buy his supplies for Hogwarts and a pet owl named Hedwig as a birthday present, Hagrid informs him of his past: Harry's parents [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|James and Lily Potter]] met their demise via a [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Killing Curse]] at the hands of the malevolent and all-powerful wizard: [[Lord Voldemort]]. Harry, the only survivor in the chaos, thus becomes well-known in the wizarding world as \"The Boy Who Lived\".\n\nHarry is then taken to [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] to board a train to Hogwarts, where he meets three other students: [[Ron Weasley]], whom he quickly befriends; [[Hermione Granger]], an intelligent witch born to [[Muggle]] parents; and [[Draco Malfoy]], a boy from a wealthy wizarding family, with whom he immediately clashes. After arriving at school the students assemble in the Great Hall, where all the first-years are sorted by the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] among four houses: [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], [[Ravenclaw]], and [[Slytherin]]. Although the Sorting Hat considers putting Harry in Slytherin with Draco, he is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione.\n\nAt Hogwarts, Harry begins learning magic spells and discovers more about his past and parents. After recovering the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Remembrall|Remembrall]] of Gryffindor student [[Neville Longbottom]], Harry is recruited for Gryffindor's [[Quidditch]] team as a Seeker, an extremely rare feat for first-year students. On their way to the dorms one night the stair cases change paths leading Harry, Ron, and Hermione to the forbidden floor of Hogwarts. The three discover a [[Cerberus|giant three-headed dog]] named Fluffy in a restricted area of the school. Ron then insults Hermione after being embarrassed by her in a charms lesson, causing Hermione to lock herself in the girls' bathroom. She is attacked by a marauding troll, but Harry and Ron save her, befriending her in the process.\n\nThe children later find out Fluffy is guarding the [[Philosopher's Stone]], an object that has the power to turn any metal into [[gold]] and produce a [[elixir of life|potion that grants immortality]]. Harry suspects that Potions teacher and head of Slytherin House [[Severus Snape]] is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort to physical form. Hagrid accidentally reveals to the trio that Fluffy will fall asleep if played music. Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide that night to try and find the stone before Snape. They discover an already asleep Fluffy and face a series of safeguards including a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys that bruise Harry, and a dangerous life-sized game of [[chess]] that almost kills Ron.\n\nAfter getting past the tasks, Harry discovers that it was [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher [[Quirinus Quirrell]] who was trying to claim the stone: Snape had actually been protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weak Voldemort living on the back of his head. Through an enchantment placed by Dumbledore, Harry finds the stone in his possession. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for reviving his parents, but Harry refuses. Quirrell attempts to kill Harry in response; however, he is instead killed after Harry ends up burning his skin, reducing Quirrell to dust and causing Voldemort's soul to rise from his ashes. Harry is knocked unconscious in the process.\n\nHarry recovers in the school hospital with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are safe. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrell: When Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, tying them for first place with Slytherin. Dumbledore then awards ten points to Neville for attempting to stop the trio, granting Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns home for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts.\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], an 11-year-old orphan raised by his unwelcoming aunt and uncle, who learns of his own fame as a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] known to have survived his parents' murder at the hands of the [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] dark wizard Lord Voldemort as an infant when he is accepted to [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

The book's first chapter is from the viewpoint of Vernon and Petunia Dursley the day before they are given Harry to look after, highlighting how non-magical people react to magic. The film removes this, beginning with Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hagrid leaving Harry with the Dursleys (although McGonagall tells Dumbledore how she had been watching the Dursleys all day). Harry's less than pleasant times at Mrs. Figg's are cut from the film while the [[boa constrictor]] from Brazil in the zoo becomes a [[Burmese Python]] in the film. Some conflicts, such as Harry and Draco's encounter with each other in Madam Malkin's robe shop and midnight duel, are not in the film. Some of [[Nicolas Flamel#In popular culture|Nicolas Flamel]]'s role is changed or cut altogether. [[Rubeus Hagrid#Norbert|Norbert]] is mentioned to have been taken away by Dumbledore in the film; whilst the book sees Harry and Hermione have to take him by hand to [[Charlie Weasley]]'s friends.

The film stars [[Christina Ricci]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], [[Eric Idle]], and [[Amy Brenneman]], and also features the voices of [[Malachi Pearson]] in the [[title role]] as well as Joe Nipote, [[Joe Alaskey]], and [[Brad Garrett]].\n\nThe film makes extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the ghosts, and it is the first feature film to have a fully CGI character in the lead role. It goes for a much darker interpretation of the Friendly Ghost in comparison to the comics, cartoons, and films of the previous years, especially with its theme of death, most notably providing the character a tragic backstory that addresses his death.\n\n''Casper'' was released in cinemas on May 26, 1995 by [[Universal Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and earned $287.9 million<ref name=\"box office\" /> on a $55 million<ref name=\"box office\"/> budget. It went on to spawn [[direct-to-video]] follow-up films and an animated television spin-off, ''[[The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Friendship, Maine]], young boys Nicky and Andreas enter Whipstaff Manor on a dare, but are scared away by a ghost named [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]]. \n\nMeanwhile, following the death of her father, neurotic and spoiled heiress Carrigan Crittenden discovers she has only been left Whipstaff Manor in his will. Carrigan and her assistant, Dibs, find a map within the will's papers that tell of an alleged treasure hidden inside the manor, but find the property haunted by Casper and his [[poltergeist]] uncles, the [[Ghostly Trio]], and unsuccessfully attempt to force the ghosts out by way of paranormal experts and a demolitions team. A lonely Casper watches a news report about paranormal therapist James Harvey and is instantly smitten with his teenage daughter, Kat, prompting Casper to inspire Carrigan in summoning Dr. Harvey to Whipstaff. Harvey and Kat are estranged due to his reputation and obsession with contacting the ghost of his late wife, Amelia. The Harveys move into Whipstaff, but Casper's attempt to befriend them fails when his uncles try to torment and scare them away, which eventually fails.\n\nCasper gains the Harveys' trust when he serves them breakfast, and follows Kat to school, where she becomes popular when her class learns she is living in Whipstaff, and agrees to host their Halloween party. Her envious classmate Amber plots with her boyfriend, Vic, to humiliate Kat during the party. Harvey attempts therapy sessions with the Ghostly Trio, who not only try to avoid them, but also reveal they know Amelia; in exchange for convincing Carrigan to leave them alone, they promise to go through the \"red tape\" involved to get Harvey a meeting with his wife.\n\nKat learns Casper has no memory of his life, and restores his old playroom to remind him. Casper recognizes an old wooden [[sled]] his father bought him, and remembers playing outside until he caught a severe cold and died of [[pneumonia]], becoming a ghost to keep his father company. A newspaper article reveals that Casper's father was declared legally insane after he built a machine, the Lazarus, which he claimed could bring the dead back to life. Casper and Kat venture to the basement and find the Lazarus. Carrigan and Dibs sneak inside, steal the formula that powers the Lazarus, and plot to use the machine, believing it could grant them immortality. However, they attempt to kill each other to test the theory and retrieve the treasure they think is in the basement's locked vault; Carrigan falls off a cliff to her death, and rises as a ghost.\n\nDr. Harvey becomes despondent after the trio prank him, prompting them to take him out on the town. They plan on killing him to make themselves a quartet, but have a change of heart after a drunken Harvey declares he will tell Carrigan off so they can stay in their home. However, Harvey accidentally falls to his death down a manhole.\n\nIn the laboratory, Carrigan confronts Casper and Kat, stealing what she believes to be the treasure from the vault and launching Dibs out a window when he tries to double-cross her. Casper and Kat trick Carrigan into saying that she has no unfinished business on Earth, causing her to eject herself into the [[afterlife]]. The treasure is revealed to be Casper's prized baseball, signed by [[Duke Snider]]; the so-called map was part of a game Casper played with his father (thus, Carrigan would've been furious to know that she went through all that trouble for nothing). Dr. Harvey, now a ghost, returns with Casper's uncles, and Kat's despair over this prompts Casper to sacrifice his one chance to return to life, restoring her father instead.\n\nThe Halloween party kicks off upstairs, and Amber and Vic's prank is thwarted by the Ghostly Trio, and they flee in terror. A boy dances with Kat revealing it was Casper who had his wish granted by the angel of Amelia who meets with Harvey and tells him that she was so content with her family while alive that she has no unfinished business, and encourages him to move on, explaining that the Ghostly Trio kept their promise, in the end, to find her for Harvey. Amelia departs as the clock chimes ten and, after kissing Kat, Casper transforms back into a ghost, scaring off the guests. Kat is impressed with the party, which Harvey says is not over, cueing the Ghostly Trio to play their nephew's theme for them to dance to.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Malachi Pearson]] as the voice of Eddie], a lonely hand, who was originally a 12-year-old boy who died of pneumonia.

The film stars [[Christina Ricci]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], [[Eric Idle]], and [[Amy Brenneman]], and also features the voices of [[Malachi Pearson]] in the [[title role]] as well as Joe Nipote, [[Joe Alaskey]], and [[Brad Garrett]].\n\nThe film makes extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the ghosts, and it is the first feature film to have a fully CGI character in the lead role. It goes for a much darker interpretation of the Friendly Ghost in comparison to the comics, cartoons, and films of the previous years, especially with its theme of death, most notably providing the character a tragic backstory that addresses his death.\n\n''Casper'' was released in cinemas on May 26, 1995 by [[Universal Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and earned $287.9 million<ref name=\"box office\" /> on a $55 million<ref name=\"box office\"/> budget. It went on to spawn [[direct-to-video]] follow-up films and an animated television spin-off, ''[[The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Friendship, Maine]], young boys Nicky and Andreas enter Whipstaff Manor on a dare, but are scared away by a ghost named [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]]. \n\nMeanwhile, following the death of her father, neurotic and spoiled heiress Carrigan Crittenden discovers she has only been left Whipstaff Manor in his will. Carrigan and her assistant, Dibs, find a map within the will's papers that tell of an alleged treasure hidden inside the manor, but find the property haunted by Casper and his [[poltergeist]] uncles, the [[Ghostly Trio]], and unsuccessfully attempt to force the ghosts out by way of paranormal experts and a demolitions team. A lonely Casper watches a news report about paranormal therapist James Harvey and is instantly smitten with his teenage daughter, Kat, prompting Casper to inspire Carrigan in summoning Dr. Harvey to Whipstaff. Harvey and Kat are estranged due to his reputation and obsession with contacting the ghost of his late wife, Amelia. The Harveys move into Whipstaff, but Casper's attempt to befriend them fails when his uncles try to torment and scare them away, which eventually fails.\n\nCasper gains the Harveys' trust when he serves them breakfast, and follows Kat to school, where she becomes popular when her class learns she is living in Whipstaff, and agrees to host their Halloween party. Her envious classmate Amber plots with her boyfriend, Vic, to humiliate Kat during the party. Harvey attempts therapy sessions with the Ghostly Trio, who not only try to avoid them, but also reveal they know Amelia; in exchange for convincing Carrigan to leave them alone, they promise to go through the \"red tape\" involved to get Harvey a meeting with his wife.\n\nKat learns Casper has no memory of his life, and restores his old playroom to remind him. Casper recognizes an old wooden [[sled]] his father bought him, and remembers playing outside until he caught a severe cold and died of [[pneumonia]], becoming a ghost to keep his father company. A newspaper article reveals that Casper's father was declared legally insane after he built a machine, the Lazarus, which he claimed could bring the dead back to life. Casper and Kat venture to the basement and find the Lazarus. Carrigan and Dibs sneak inside, steal the formula that powers the Lazarus, and plot to use the machine, believing it could grant them immortality. However, they attempt to kill each other to test the theory and retrieve the treasure they think is in the basement's locked vault; Carrigan falls off a cliff to her death, and rises as a ghost.\n\nDr. Harvey becomes despondent after the trio prank him, prompting them to take him out on the town. They plan on killing him to make themselves a quartet, but have a change of heart after a drunken Harvey declares he will tell Carrigan off so they can stay in their home. However, Harvey accidentally falls to his death down a manhole.\n\nIn the laboratory, Carrigan confronts Casper and Kat, stealing what she believes to be the treasure from the vault and launching Dibs out a window when he tries to double-cross her. Casper and Kat trick Carrigan into saying that she has no unfinished business on Earth, causing her to eject herself into the [[afterlife]]. The treasure is revealed to be Casper's prized baseball, signed by [[Duke Snider]]; the so-called map was part of a game Casper played with his father (thus, Carrigan would've been furious to know that she went through all that trouble for nothing). Dr. Harvey, now a ghost, returns with Casper's uncles, and Kat's despair over this prompts Casper to sacrifice his one chance to return to life, restoring her father instead.\n\nThe Halloween party kicks off upstairs, and Amber and Vic's prank is thwarted by the Ghostly Trio, and they flee in terror. A boy dances with Kat revealing it was Casper who had his wish granted by the angel of Amelia who meets with Harvey and tells him that she was so content with her family while alive that she has no unfinished business, and encourages him to move on, explaining that the Ghostly Trio kept their promise, in the end, to find her for Harvey. Amelia departs as the clock chimes ten and, after kissing Kat, Casper transforms back into a ghost, scaring off the guests. Kat is impressed with the party, which Harvey says is not over, cueing the Ghostly Trio to play their nephew's theme for them to dance to.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Malachi Pearson]] as the voice of [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper McFadden]], a lonely ghost, who was originally a 12-year-old boy who died of pneumonia.

History records that it is called a sea because the Romans found it salty, especially in the southern reaches, and the name stuck.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Oil and natural gas production platforms are replete along the edges of the sea. In addition, large quantities of sturgeon live in its waters, and the caviar produced from their eggs is a valuable commodity. Fresh water flows into the sea via the Volga River and Ural River in the north; however, the sea remains somewhat salty, central and south. The measured surface area is 371,000 km<sup>2</sup> (143,244 sq mi), and he maximum depth is at 1025 m (3,363&nbsp;ft). Additional details and map.\n\n====Lake Baikal====\nLake Baikal is positioned in southeastern (Siberia) Russia, directly to the north of Mongolia. Recognized as the oldest (still existing) freshwater lake on the planet, it is also measured as the deepest continental body of water at 5,315 feet (1,620 m). In addition, it is the largest freshwater lake by volume, containing an astounding 20% of the planet's fresh water. With a maximum width of 60 miles (96&nbsp;km), Lake Baikal is about 389 miles (626&nbsp;km) in length. Completely surrounded by mountains, over 300 rivers and streams drain into this massive lake. Detailed map.\n\n====Aral Sea====\nPositioned in far-western Asia, just to the east of the Caspian Sea, the Aral Sea is located in the countries of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The Aral Sea is disappearing (evaporating) and is today almost totally polluted by fertilizer runoff, weapon testing residue left here by the former Soviet Union and careless industrial projects. The mismanagement of its valuable waters is considered by many experts to be one of the world's worst environmental disasters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Diversion of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers for irrigation began in 1918, and that action, along with other factors have now shrunk the Aral Sea to almost 60% of its former size. Over the last few years the outlook for the northern reaches of the sea have brightened some, but the lower half is basically abandoned and the remaining western waters are now predicted to be gone within a decade.

Sea, located in western Asia on the eastern edges of Europe, is the largest lake on the planet. History records that it is called a sea because the Romans found it salty, especially in the southern reaches, and the name stuck.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Oil and natural gas production platforms are replete along the edges of the sea. In addition, large quantities of sturgeon live in its waters, and the caviar produced from their eggs is a valuable commodity. Fresh water flows into the sea via the Volga River and Ural River in the north; however, the sea remains somewhat salty, central and south. The measured surface area is 371,000 km<sup>2</sup> (143,244 sq mi), and he maximum depth is at 1025 m (3,363&nbsp;ft). Additional details and map.\n\n====Lake Baikal====\nLake Baikal is positioned in southeastern (Siberia) Russia, directly to the north of Mongolia. Recognized as the oldest (still existing) freshwater lake on the planet, it is also measured as the deepest continental body of water at 5,315 feet (1,620 m). In addition, it is the largest freshwater lake by volume, containing an astounding 20% of the planet's fresh water. With a maximum width of 60 miles (96&nbsp;km), Lake Baikal is about 389 miles (626&nbsp;km) in length. Completely surrounded by mountains, over 300 rivers and streams drain into this massive lake. Detailed map.\n\n====Aral Sea====\nPositioned in far-western Asia, just to the east of the Caspian Sea, the Aral Sea is located in the countries of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The Aral Sea is disappearing (evaporating) and is today almost totally polluted by fertilizer runoff, weapon testing residue left here by the former Soviet Union and careless industrial projects. The mismanagement of its valuable waters is considered by many experts to be one of the world's worst environmental disasters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Diversion of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers for irrigation began in 1918, and that action, along with other factors have now shrunk the Aral Sea to almost 60% of its former size. Over the last few years the outlook for the northern reaches of the sea have brightened some, but the lower half is basically abandoned and the remaining western waters are now predicted to be gone within a decade.
