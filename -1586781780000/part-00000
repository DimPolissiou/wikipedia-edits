He [[nationalization|nationalized]] strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full [[external debt]] and achieved nearly [[full employment]]. The economy, however, began to decline in 1950 because of over-expenditure. His highly popular wife, [[Eva Per\u00f3n]], played a central political role. She pushed Congress to enact [[women's suffrage]] in 1947,{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=3}} and developed an unprecedented social assistance to the most vulnerable sectors of society.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|pp=113ff}} However, her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year. Per\u00f3n [[Argentine general election, 1951|was reelected in 1951]], surpassing even his 1946 performance. In 1955 the Navy [[bombing of Plaza de Mayo|bombed the Plaza de Mayo]] in an ill-fated attempt to kill the President. A few months later, during the self-called [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora|Liberating Revolution]] coup, he resigned and went into [[exile]] in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

Trade unionists were targeted for assassination by the Peronist and Marxist paramilitaries as early as 1969, and individual cases of [[state-sponsored terrorism]] against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the [[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]] in 1955. The [[Trelew massacre]] of 1972, the actions of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] since 1973, and [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]]'s \"annihilation decrees\" against left-wing guerrillas during ''[[Operativo Independencia]]'' (translates to Operation of Independence) in 1975, have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War.\n\nOngan\u00eda shut down Congress, banned all political parties and dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two massive protests: the ''[[Cordobazo]]'' and the ''[[Rosariazo]]''. The terrorist guerrilla organization [[Montoneros]] kidnapped and executed Aramburu.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=127}} The newly chosen head of government, [[Alejandro Agust\u00edn Lanusse]], seeking to ease the growing political pressure, let [[H\u00e9ctor Jos\u00e9 C\u00e1mpora]] be the Peronist candidate instead of Per\u00f3n. C\u00e1mpora won the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|March 1973 election]], issued a [[amnesty|pardon]] for condemned guerrilla members and then secured Per\u00f3n's return from his exile in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=423\u201365}}\n\nOn the day Per\u00f3n returned to Argentina, the clash between Peronist internal factions\u2014[[right-wing]] union leaders and [[left-wing]] youth from Montoneros\u2014resulted in the [[Ezeiza Massacre]]. C\u00e1mpora resigned, overwhelmed by political violence, and Per\u00f3n won the [[Argentine general election, September 1973|September 1973 election]] with his third wife [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n|Isabel]] as vice-president. He [[expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo|expelled Montoneros from the party]]{{sfn|Robben|2011|pp=76\u201377}} and they became once again a clandestine organization. [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega]] organized the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] (AAA) to fight against them and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP).\nPer\u00f3n died in July 1974 and was succeeded by his wife, who signed a secret decree empowering the military and the police to \"annihilate\" the left-wing subversion,{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=145}} [[Operation Independence|stopping ERP's attempt]] to start a rural insurgence in Tucum\u00e1n province.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=148}} [[March 1976 coup|Isabel Per\u00f3n was ousted]] one year later by a junta of the three armed forces, led by army general [[Jorge Rafael Videla]].

By the end of 1976 Montoneros had lost near 2,000 members; by 1977, the ERP was completely defeated. A severely weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979, which was quickly annihilated, ending the guerrilla threat. Nevertheless, the junta stayed in power.\n\nIn 1982, the then head of state, General [[Leopoldo Galtieri]], authorised the invasion of the British territories of South Georgia and, on 2 April, of the [[Operation Rosario|Falkland Islands]].

The western pampas receive less rainfall, this ''dry pampa'' is a plain of short grasses or [[steppe]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe [[National Parks of Argentina]] make up a network of 35 [[national park]]s in Argentina.

In this stage, in 1786, a tragedy entitled ''Siripo'' had its premiere. ''Siripo'' is now a lost work (only the second act is conserved), and can be considered the first Argentine stage play, because it was written by Buenos Aires poet Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Lavard\u00e9n, it was premiered in Buenos Aires, and its plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]]: the destruction of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti Spiritu]] colony by aboriginals in 1529. ''La Rancher\u00eda'' theatre operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792. The second theatre stage in Buenos Aires was [[Teatro Coliseo]], opened in 1804 during the term of Viceroy [[Rafael de Sobremonte]]. It was the nation's longest-continuously operating stage. The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem, [[Blas Parera]], earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century. The genre suffered during the regime of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], though it flourished alongside the economy later in the century. The national government gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the [[Col\u00f3n Theatre]], in 1857, which hosted classical and operatic, as well as stage performances. Antonio Petalardo's successful 1871 gambit on the opening of the [[Teatro Opera]], inspired others to fund the growing art in Argentina.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{main|Cinema of Argentina}}\nThe Argentine film industry has historically been one of the three most developed in [[Latin American cinema]], along with those produced in [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Cinema of Brazil|Brazil]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl J.|last=Mora|title=Mexican Cinema: Reflections of a Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOwdFIQiTv8C&pg=PA196|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04304-6|page=196}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.argentina.ar/_es/cultura/cine/index.php |title=Argentina \u2013 Cultura \u2013 Cine |language=Spanish |date=16 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141530/http://www.argentina.ar/_es/cultura/cine/index.php |archivedate=16 December 2008}}</ref> Started in 1896; by the early 1930s it had already become Latin America's leading film producer, a place it kept until the early 1950s.{{sfn|King|2000|p=36}} The world's first [[list of animated feature films|animated feature films]] were made and released in Argentina, by cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]], in 1917 and 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.4/articles/bendazzi1.4.html|title=Quirino Cristiani, The Untold Story of Argentina's Pioneer Animator|first=Giannalberto|last=Bendazzi|publisher=Animation World Network|year=1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928121624/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.4/articles/bendazzi1.4.html|archivedate=28 September 2013|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|caption_align=center\n|image1=Andr\u00e9s Muschietti.jpg|caption1=[[Andy Muschietti]], director of ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', the highest-grossing horror film of all-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever|title=Stephen King's It scares off The Exorcist to become highest-grossing horror ever|last=Mumford|first=Gwilym|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 29, 2017|accessdate=October 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114000256/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-it-movie-horror-record-despicable-me-3-kingsman-never-say-die-weekend-results-international-box-office-1202184382/|title='Blade Runner 2049' Launches With $50M Overseas; 'It' Tops $600M WW; 'Despicable 3' Hops Past 'Zootopia' \u2013 Intl Box Office|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008205909/http://deadline.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-it-movie-horror-record-despicable-me-3-kingsman-never-say-die-weekend-results-international-box-office-1202184382/|archive-date=8 October 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|image2=Marcelo Pont Verg\u00e9s.jpg|caption2=The art director of ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' won the [[Academy Award]] for that film.\n}}\n\nArgentine films have achieved worldwide recognition: the country has won two [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]], for ''[[The Official Story]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (2009), from seven nominations:\n* ''[[The Truce (1974 film)|The Truce]]'' (''La tregua'') in 1974\n* ''[[Camila (film)|Camila]]'' in 1984\n* ''[[The Official Story]]'' (''La historia oficial'') in 1985\n* ''[[Tango (1998 film)|Tango]]'' in 1998\n* ''[[Son of the Bride]]'' (''El hijo de la novia'') in 2001\n* ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (''El secreto de sus ojos'') in 2009\n* ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (''Relatos salvajes'') in 2015\n\nIn addition, Argentine composers [[Luis Enrique Bacalov]] and [[Gustavo Santaolalla]] have been honored with [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Awards for Best Original Score]], and [[Armando B\u00f3 (screenwriter)|Armando B\u00f3]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Giacobone]] shared in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] for 2014.

He [[nationalization|nationalized]] strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full [[external debt]] and achieved nearly [[full employment]]. The economy, however, began to decline in 1950 because of over-expenditure. His highly popular wife, [[Eva Per\u00f3n]], played a central political role. She pushed Congress to enact [[women's suffrage]] in 1947,{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=3}} and developed an unprecedented social assistance to the most vulnerable sectors of society.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|pp=113ff}} However, her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year. Per\u00f3n [[Argentine general election, 1951|was reelected in 1951]], surpassing even his 1946 performance. In 1955 the Navy [[bombing of Plaza de Mayo|bombed the Plaza de Mayo]] in an ill-fated attempt to kill the President. A few months later, during the self-called [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora|Liberating Revolution]] coup, he resigned and went into [[exile]] in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

Trade unionists were targeted for assassination by the Peronist and Marxist paramilitaries as early as 1969, and individual cases of [[state-sponsored terrorism]] against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the [[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]] in 1955. The [[Trelew massacre]] of 1972, the actions of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] since 1973, and [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]]'s \"annihilation decrees\" against left-wing guerrillas during ''[[Operativo Independencia]]'' (translates to Operation of Independence) in 1975, have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War.\n\nOngan\u00eda shut down Congress, banned all political parties and dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two massive protests: the ''[[Cordobazo]]'' and the ''[[Rosariazo]]''. The terrorist guerrilla organization [[Montoneros]] kidnapped and executed Aramburu.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=127}} The newly chosen head of government, [[Alejandro Agust\u00edn Lanusse]], seeking to ease the growing political pressure, let [[H\u00e9ctor Jos\u00e9 C\u00e1mpora]] be the Peronist candidate instead of Per\u00f3n. C\u00e1mpora won the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|March 1973 election]], issued a [[amnesty|pardon]] for condemned guerrilla members and then secured Per\u00f3n's return from his exile in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=423\u201365}}\n\nOn the day Per\u00f3n returned to Argentina, the clash between Peronist internal factions\u2014[[right-wing]] union leaders and [[left-wing]] youth from Montoneros\u2014resulted in the [[Ezeiza Massacre]]. C\u00e1mpora resigned, overwhelmed by political violence, and Per\u00f3n won the [[Argentine general election, September 1973|September 1973 election]] with his third wife [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n|Isabel]] as vice-president. He [[expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo|expelled Montoneros from the party]]{{sfn|Robben|2011|pp=76\u201377}} and they became once again a clandestine organization. [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega]] organized the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] (AAA) to fight against them and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP).\nPer\u00f3n died in July 1974 and was succeeded by his wife, who signed a secret decree empowering the military and the police to \"annihilate\" the left-wing subversion,{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=145}} [[Operation Independence|stopping ERP's attempt]] to start a rural insurgence in Tucum\u00e1n province.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=148}} [[March 1976 coup|Isabel Per\u00f3n was ousted]] one year later by a junta of the three armed forces, led by army general [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]. They initiated the [[National Reorganization Process]], often shortened to ''Proceso''.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

By the end of 1976 Montoneros had lost near 2,000 members; by 1977, the ERP was completely defeated. A severely weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979, which was quickly annihilated, ending the guerrilla threat. Nevertheless, the junta stayed in power.\n\nIn 1982, the then head of state, General [[Leopoldo Galtieri]], authorised the invasion of the British territories of South Georgia and, on 2 April, of the [[Operation Rosario|Falkland Islands]].

In this stage, in 1786, a tragedy entitled ''Siripo'' had its premiere. ''Siripo'' is now a lost work (only the second act is conserved), and can be considered the first Argentine stage play, because it was written by Buenos Aires poet Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Lavard\u00e9n, it was premiered in Buenos Aires, and its plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]]: the destruction of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti Spiritu]] colony by aboriginals in 1529. ''La Rancher\u00eda'' theatre operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792. The second theatre stage in Buenos Aires was [[Teatro Coliseo]], opened in 1804 during the term of Viceroy [[Rafael de Sobremonte]]. It was the nation's longest-continuously operating stage. The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem, [[Blas Parera]], earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century. The genre suffered during the regime of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], though it flourished alongside the economy later in the century. The national government gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the [[Col\u00f3n Theatre]], in 1857, which hosted classical and operatic, as well as stage performances. Antonio Petalardo's successful 1871 gambit on the opening of the [[Teatro Opera]], inspired others to fund the growing art in Argentina.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{main|Cinema of Argentina}}\nThe Argentine film industry has historically been one of the three most developed in [[Latin American cinema]], along with those produced in [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Cinema of Brazil|Brazil]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl J.|last=Mora|title=Mexican Cinema: Reflections of a Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOwdFIQiTv8C&pg=PA196|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04304-6|page=196}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.argentina.ar/_es/cultura/cine/index.php |title=Argentina \u2013 Cultura \u2013 Cine |language=Spanish |date=16 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141530/http://www.argentina.ar/_es/cultura/cine/index.php |archivedate=16 December 2008}}</ref> Started in 1896; by the early 1930s it had already become Latin America's leading film producer, a place it kept until the early 1950s.{{sfn|King|2000|p=36}} The world's first [[list of animated feature films|animated feature films]] were made and released in Argentina, by cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]], in 1917 and 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.4/articles/bendazzi1.4.html|title=Quirino Cristiani, The Untold Story of Argentina's Pioneer Animator|first=Giannalberto|last=Bendazzi|publisher=Animation World Network|year=1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928121624/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.4/articles/bendazzi1.4.html|archivedate=28 September 2013|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|caption_align=center\n|image1=Andr\u00e9s Muschietti.jpg|caption1=[[Andy Muschietti]], director of ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', the highest-grossing horror film of all-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever|title=Stephen King's It scares off The Exorcist to become highest-grossing horror ever|last=Mumford|first=Gwilym|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 29, 2017|accessdate=October 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114000256/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-it-movie-horror-record-despicable-me-3-kingsman-never-say-die-weekend-results-international-box-office-1202184382/|title='Blade Runner 2049' Launches With $50M Overseas; 'It' Tops $600M WW; 'Despicable 3' Hops Past 'Zootopia' \u2013 Intl Box Office|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008205909/http://deadline.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-it-movie-horror-record-despicable-me-3-kingsman-never-say-die-weekend-results-international-box-office-1202184382/|archive-date=8 October 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|image2=Marcelo Pont Verg\u00e9s.jpg|caption2=The art director of ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' won the [[Academy Award]] for that film.\n}}\n\nArgentine films have achieved worldwide recognition: the country has won two [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]], for ''[[The Official Story]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (2009), from seven nominations:\n* ''[[The Truce (1974 film)|The Truce]]'' (''La tregua'') in 1974\n* ''[[Camila (film)|Camila]]'' in 1984\n* ''[[The Official Story]]'' (''La historia oficial'') in 1985\n* ''[[Tango (1998 film)|Tango]]'' in 1998\n* ''[[Son of the Bride]]'' (''El hijo de la novia'') in 2001\n* ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (''El secreto de sus ojos'') in 2009\n* ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (''Relatos salvajes'') in 2015\n\nIn addition, Argentine composers [[Luis Enrique Bacalov]] and [[Gustavo Santaolalla]] have been honored with [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Awards for Best Original Score]], and [[Armando B\u00f3 (screenwriter)|Armando B\u00f3]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Giacobone]] shared in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] for 2014.

Campaigners including [[Marie Stopes]] in England and [[Margaret Sanger]] in the US had succeeded in bringing the issue into the open, and birth control clinics were established which offered family planning advice and contraceptive methods to women in need.\n\nIn 1929, the [[Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929|Infant Life Preservation Act]] was passed in the [[United Kingdom]], which amended the law ([[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]) so that an abortion carried out in good faith, for the sole purpose of preserving the life of the mother, would not be an offence.<ref>[[Hansard|HL Deb]].

Browne's beliefs were heavily influenced by the work of [[Havelock Ellis]], [[Edward Carpenter]] and other [[sexologists]].<ref name=\"Hall\">{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Lesley|title=The Life and Times of Stella Browne: Feminist and Free Spirit|year=2011|pages=27\u2013178}}</ref> She came to strongly believe that working women should have the choice to become pregnant and to terminate their pregnancy while they worked in the horrible circumstances surrounding a pregnant woman who was still required to do hard labour during her pregnancy.<ref>Jones, Greta. \"Women and eugenics in Britain: The case of Mary Scharlieb, Elizabeth Sloan Chesser, and Stella Browne.\" ''[[Annals of Science]]'' 52 no. 5 (1995):481-502</ref> In this case she argued that doctors should give free information about birth control to women that wanted to know about it. This would give women agency over their own circumstances and allow them to decide whether they wanted to be mothers or not.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rowbotham|first=Sheila|title=A New World for Women: Stella Browne, social feminist|year=1977|pages=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1920s Browne began a speaking tour around England, providing information about her beliefs on the need for accessibility of information about birth control for women, women's health problems, problems related to puberty and sex education and high maternal morbidity rates among other topics.<ref name=\"Hall\"/> These talks urged women to take matters of their sexuality and their health into their own hands. She became increasingly interested in her view of the woman's right to terminate their pregnancies, and in 1929 she brought forward her lecture \u201cThe Right to Abortion\u201d in front of the [[World Sexual Reform Congress]] in London.<ref name=\"Hall\"/> In 1931 Browne began to develop her argument for women's right to decide to have an [[abortion]].<ref name=\"Hall\"/> She again began touring, giving lectures on abortion and the negative consequences that followed if women were unable to terminate pregnancies of their own choosing such as: suicide, injury, permanent invalidism, madness and blood-poisoning.<ref name=\"Hall\"/>\n\n[[File:Aleck bourne trial.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aleck Bourne]] was acquitted for performing an abortion on a rape victim in 1938, a landmark case in the movement for abortion rights.]]\nOther prominent feminists, including [[Frida Laski]], [[Dora Russell]], [[Joan Malleson]] and [[Janet Chance]] began to champion this cause - the cause broke dramatically into the mainstream in July 1932 when the [[British Medical Association]] council formed a committee to discuss making changes to the laws on abortion.<ref name=\"Hall\"/> On 17 February 1936, [[Janet Chance]], Alice Jenkins and [[Joan Malleson]] established the [[Abortion Law Reform Association]] as the first [[advocacy]] organisation for abortion liberalization. The association promoted access to [[abortion in the United Kingdom]] and campaigned for the elimination of legal obstacles.<ref name=\"HindellSimms\">{{cite journal|last=Hindell|first=Keith|author2=Madeline Simms|title=How the Abortion Lobby Worked|year=1968|journal=[[The Political Quarterly]]|pages=271\u2013272}}</ref> In its first year ALRA recruited 35 members, and by 1939 had almost 400 members.<ref name=\"HindellSimms\"/>\n\nThe ALRA was very active between 1936 and 1939 sending speakers around the country to talk about Labour and Equal Citizenship and attempted, though most often unsuccessfully, to have letters and articles published in newspapers. They became the most popular when a member of the ALRA's Medico-Legal Committee received the case of a fourteen-year-old girl who had been raped, and received a termination of this pregnancy from Dr. [[Joan Malleson]], a progenitor of the ALRA.<ref name=\"HindellSimms\"/> This case gained a lot of publicity, however once the war began, the case was tucked away and the cause again lost its importance to the public.\n\nIn 1938, [[Joan Malleson]] precipitated one of the most influential cases in British abortion law when she referred a pregnant fourteen-year old [[rape]] victim to [[gynaecology|gynaecologist]] [[Aleck Bourne]]. He performed an abortion, then illegal, and was put on trial on charges of procuring abortion. Bourne was eventually acquitted in ''Rex v. Bourne'' as his actions were \"...an example of disinterested conduct in consonance with the highest traditions of the profession\".<ref>R v Bourne [1939] 1 KB 687, [1938] 3 All ER 615, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]</ref> This court case set a precedent that doctors could not be prosecuted for performing an abortion in cases where pregnancy would probably cause \"mental and physical wreck\".\n\nThe [[Abortion Law Reform Association]] continued its campaigning after the War, and this, combined with broad social changes brought the issue of abortion back into the political arena in the 1960s. President of the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] [[John Peel (gynaecologist)|John Peel]] chaired the committee advising the [[British Government]] on what became the [[1967 Abortion Act]], which allowed for legal abortion on a number of grounds, including to avoid injury to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing child(ren) if the pregnancy was still under 28 weeks.<ref name=\"Commons 1967\">House of Commons, Science and Technology Committee. \"Scientific Developments Relating to the Abortion Act 1967.\" 1 (2006-2007).

The forerunner of the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] was formed in 1969 to oppose restrictions on abortion and expand access to abortion.<ref>[http://www.nwhn.org/content/index.php?pid=106 National Women's Health Network | A Voice For Women, A Network For Change<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In late 1973 NARAL became the National Abortion Rights Action League.\n\nThe landmark judicial ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' ruled that a [[Texas]] statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional. The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]]. The Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being in the decision [[Doe v. Bolton]], delivered concurrently.\n\nFrom the 1970s, and the spread of [[second-wave feminism]], abortion and [[reproductive rights]] became unifying issues among various [[feminism|women's rights]] groups in Canada, the United States, the Netherlands, Britain, Norway, France, Germany, and Italy.<ref>LeGates, Marlene.

Campaigners including [[Marie Stopes]] in England and [[Margaret Sanger]] in the US had succeeded in bringing the issue into the open, and birth control clinics were established which offered family planning advice and contraceptive methods to women in need.\n\nIn 1929, the [[Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929|Infant Life Preservation Act]] was passed in the [[United Kingdom]], which amended the law ([[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]) so that an abortion carried out in good faith, for the sole purpose of preserving the life of the mother, would not be an offence.<ref>[[Hansard|HL Deb]].

She became increasingly interested in her view of the woman's right to terminate their pregnancies, and in 1929 she brought forward her lecture \u201cThe Right to Abortion\u201d in front of the [[World Sexual Reform Congress]] in London.<ref name=\"Hall\"/> In 1931 Browne began to develop her argument for women's right to decide to have an [[abortion]].<ref name=\"Hall\"/> She again began touring, giving lectures on abortion and the negative consequences that followed if women were unable to terminate pregnancies of their own choosing such as: suicide, injury, permanent invalidism, madness and blood-poisoning.<ref name=\"Hall\"/>\n\n[[File:Aleck bourne trial.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aleck Bourne]] was acquitted for performing an abortion on a rape victim in 1938, a landmark case in the movement for abortion rights.]]\nOther prominent feminists, including [[Frida Laski]], [[Dora Russell]], [[Joan Malleson]] and [[Janet Chance]] began to champion this cause - the cause broke dramatically into the mainstream in July 1932 when the [[British Medical Association]] council formed a committee to discuss making changes to the laws on abortion.<ref name=\"Hall\"/> On 17 February 1936, [[Janet Chance]], Alice Jenkins and [[Joan Malleson]] established the [[Abortion Law Reform Association]] as the first [[advocacy]] organisation for abortion liberalization.

He performed an abortion, then illegal, and was put on trial on charges of procuring abortion. Bourne was eventually acquitted in ''Rex v.

President of the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] [[John Peel (gynaecologist)|John Peel]] chaired the committee advising the [[British Government]] on what became the [[1967 Abortion Act]], which allowed for legal abortion on a number of grounds, including to avoid injury to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing child(ren) if the pregnancy was still under 28 weeks.<ref name=\"Commons 1967\">House of Commons, Science and Technology Committee. \"Scientific Developments Relating to the Abortion Act 1967.\" 1 (2006-2007).

Wade]]'' ruled that a [[Texas]] statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional. The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]]. The Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor.

However, more recent evidence has shown that Dionysus was in fact one of the earliest gods attested in mainland Greek culture.<ref name=iconography/> The earliest written records of Dionysus worship come from [[Mycenaean Greece]], specifically in and around the [[Palace of Nestor]] in [[Pylos]], dated to around 1300 BC.<ref name=Kerenyi>Ker\u00e9nyi, Karl. 1976. ''Dionysus''. Trans. Ralph Manheim, Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0691029156|978-0691029153}}</ref> The details of any religion surrounding Dionysus in this period are scant, and most evidence comes in the form only of his name, written as ''di-wo-nu-su-jo'' (\"Dionysoio\") in [[Linear B]], preserved on fragments of clay tablets that indicate a connection to offerings or payments of wine, which was described as being \"of Dionysoio\". References have also been uncovered to \"women of Oinoa\", the \"place of wine\", who may correspond to the Dionysian women of later periods.<ref name=Kerenyi/> Other Mycenaean records from Pylos record the worship of a god named Eleuther, who was the son of Zeus, and to whom oxen were sacrificed. The link to both Zeus and oxen, as well as etymological links between the name Eleuther or Eleutheros with the Latin name [[Liber|Liber Pater]], indicates that this may have been another name for Dionysus. According to [[K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi]], these clues suggest that even in the thirteenth century BC, the core religion of Dionysus was in place, as were his important myths. At [[Knossos]] in Minoan [[Crete]], men were often given the name \"Pentheus\", who is a figure in later Dionysian myth and which also means \"suffering\". Ker\u00e9nyi argued that to give such a name to one's child implies a strong religious connection, potentially not the separate character of Pentheus who suffers at the hands of Dionysus' followers in later myths, but as an epithet of Dionysus himself, whose mythology describes a god who must endure suffering before triumphing over it. According to Ker\u00e9nyi, the title of \"man who suffers\" likely originally referred to the god himself, only being applied to distinct characters as the myth developed.<ref name=Kerenyi/>\nThe oldest known image of Dionysus, accompanied by his name, is found on a [[dinos]] by the Attic potter [[Sophilos]] around 570 BC. By the seventh century, iconography found on pottery shows that Dionysus was already worshiped as more than just a god associated with wine. He was associated with weddings, death, sacrifice, and sexuality, and his retinue of satyrs and dancers was already established. A common theme in these early depictions was the metamorphosis, at the hand of the god, of his followers into hybrid creatures, usually represented by both tame and wild [[satyr]]s, representing the transition from civilized life back to nature as a means of escape.<ref name=iconography>Isler-Ker\u00e9nyi, C., & Watson, W.

It was held during the winter month of Poseideon (the time surrounding the winter solstice, modern December or January). The Rural Dionysia centered on a procession, during which participants carried phalluses, long loaves of bread, jars of water and wine as well as other offerings, and young girls carried baskets. The procession was followed by a series of dramatic performances and drama competitions.<ref name=athens_festivals>Sir Arthur Pickard-Cambridge. The Dramatic Festivals of Athens. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953 (2nd ed. 1968). {{ISBN|0-19-814258-7}}</ref>\n\nThe City Dionysia (or Great Dionysia) took place in urban centers such as [[Athens]] and [[Eleusis]], and was a later development, probably beginning during the sixth century BC. Held three months after the Rural Dionysia, the Greater festival fell near the spring equinox in the month of Elaphebolion (modern March or April). The procession of the City Dionysia was similar to that of the rural celebrations, but more elaborate, and led by participants carrying a wooden statue of Dionysus, and including sacrificial bulls and ornately dressed choruses. The dramatic competitions of the Greater Dionysia also featured more noteworthy poets and playwrights, and prizes for both dramatists and actors in multiple categories.<ref name=athens_festivals/><ref name=Brockett>Brockett, Oscar Gross (1968).

AD 100, [[British Museum]], [[London]].]]\nThe central religious cult of Dionysus is known as the Bacchic or [[Dionysian Mysteries]]. The exact origin of this religion is unknown, though [[Orpheus]] was said to have invented the mysteries of Dionysus.<ref name=\"Apollodorus1.3.2\">Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.3.2 ''Library and Epitome'', 1.3.2]. \"Orpheus also invented the mysteries of Dionysus, and having been torn in pieces by the Maenads he is buried in Pieria.\"</ref> Evidence suggests that many sources and rituals typically considered to be part of the similar [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic Mysteries]] actually belong to Dionysian mysteries.<ref name=iconography/> Some scholars have suggested that, additionally, there is no difference between the Dionysian mysteries and the mysteries of [[Persephone]], but that these were all facets of the same mystery religion, and that Dionysus and Persephone both had important roles in it.<ref name=iconography/><ref>Dickie, M.W. 1995. The Dionysiac Mysteries. In Pella, ZPE 109, 81-86.</ref> Previously considered to have been a primarily rural and fringe part of Greek religion, the major urban center of [[Athens]] played a major role in the development and spread of the Bacchic mysteries.<ref name=iconography/>\n\nThe Bacchic mysteries served an important role in creating ritual traditions for transitions in people's lives; originally primarily for men and male sexuality, but later also created space for ritualizing women's changing roles and celebrating changes of status in a woman's life. This was often symbolized by a meeting with the gods who rule over death and change, such as [[Hades]] and Persephone, but also with Dionysus' mother Semele, who probably served a role related to initiation into the mysteries.<ref name=iconography/>\n\nThe religion of Dionysus often included rituals involving the sacrifice of goats or bulls, and at least some participants and dancers wore wooden masks associated with the god. In some instances, records show the god participating in the ritual via a masked and clothed pillar, pole, or tree is used, while his worshipers eat bread and drink wine. The significance of masks and goats to the worship of Dionysus seems to date back to the earliest days of his worship, and these symbols have been found together at a [[Minoan]] tomb near [[Phaistos]] in Crete.<ref name=Kerenyi/>\n\n===Eleusinian mysteries===\n[[File:Hans von Aachen - Bacchus, Ceres and Amor (?) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Bacchus, Ceres and Amor'', (1595\u20131605).

It was established around 200 BC in the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] grove of [[Semele#Semele in Roman culture|Stimula]] by a [[Paculla Annia|priestess]] from [[Campania]], near the [[Aventine Triad|temple]] where [[Liber Pater]] (\"the Free Father\") had a State-sanctioned, popular cult. [[Liber]] was a native Roman god of wine, fertility, and prophecy, patron of Rome's [[plebeian]]s (citizen-commoners), and one of the members of the [[Aventine Triad]], along with his mother Ceres and sister or consort Libera. A temple to the Triad was erected on the [[Aventine Hill]] in 493 BC, along with the institution of celebrating the festival of [[Liberalia]]. The worship of the Triad gradually took on more and more Greek influence, and by 205 BC, Liber and Libera had been formally identified with Bacchus and [[Proserpina]].<ref>[[T. P.

These Bacchic rituals were said to have included [[Omophagia|omophagic]] practices, such as pulling live animals apart and eating the whole of them raw. This practice served not only as a reenactment of the infant death and rebirth of Bacchus, but also as a means by which Bacchic practitioners produced \"enthusiasm\": etymologically, to let a god enter the practitioner's body or to have her become one with Bacchus.<ref>Russell, Bertrand. History of Western Philosophy.Routledge, 1996, p. 25</ref><ref>Kraemer, Ross S. \"Ecstasy and Possession: The Attraction of Women to the Cult of Dionysus.\" The Harvard Theological Review, Vol. 72 60 Jan.\u2013Apr. 1979.</ref>\n\nIn [[Livy]]'s account, the Bacchic mysteries were a novelty at Rome; originally restricted to women and held only three times a year, they were corrupted by an Etruscan-Greek version, and thereafter drunken, disinhibited men and women of all ages and social classes cavorted in a sexual free-for-all five times a month. Livy relates their various outrages against Rome's civil and religious laws and traditional morality (''[[mos maiorum]]''); a secretive, subversive and potentially revolutionary counter-culture. Livy's sources, and his own account of the cult, probably drew heavily on the Roman dramatic ''genre'' known as \"Satyr plays\", based on Greek originals.<ref>...\"the Bacchic passages in the Roman drama, taken over from their Greek models, presented a pejorative image of the Bacchic cult which predisposed the Romans towards persecution before the consul denounced the cult in 186.\" Robert Rouselle, Liber-Dionysus in Early Roman Drama, ''The Classical Journal'', 82, 3 (1987), p. 193.</ref><ref>\"Certainly it is hard to imagine anything less consistent with Roman [[mos maiorum]] than the anarchic hedonism of satyrs.

[https://www.jstor.org/pss/301447] (accessed November 19, 2017)</ref> The cult was suppressed by the State with great ferocity; of the 7,000 arrested, most were executed. Modern scholarship treats much of Livy's account with skepticism; more certainly, a Senatorial edict, the ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]'' was distributed throughout Roman and allied Italy. It banned the former Bacchic cult organisations. Each meeting must seek prior senatorial approval through a [[praetor]]. No more than three women and two men were allowed at any one meeting, Those who defied the edict risked the death penalty.\n\nBacchus was conscripted into the official Roman pantheon as an aspect of Liber, and his festival was inserted into the [[Liberalia]]. In Roman culture, Liber, Bacchus and Dionysus became virtually interchangeable equivalents. Thanks to his mythology involving travels and struggles on earth, Bacchus became [[Euhemerism|euhemerised]] as a historical hero, conqueror, and founder of cities. He was a patron deity and founding hero at [[Leptis Magna]], birthplace of the emperor [[Septimius Severus]], who promoted his cult. In some Roman sources, the ritual procession of Bacchus in a tiger-drawn chariot, surrounded by maenads, satyrs and drunks, commemorates the god's triumphant return from the conquest of India. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] believed this to be the historical prototype for the [[Roman Triumph]].<ref>Pliny attributes the invention of the triumph to \"Father [[Liber]]\" (who by Pliny's time was identified with Bacchus and Dionysus): see Pliny, ''Historia Naturalis'', 7.57 (ed.

Nysa was regarded as the birthplace and first home of Dionysus. The divine marriage of Plouton and Persephone was celebrated on 'the meadow'. The dangerous region that Kore let herself be lured to in search of flowers was likely not originally connected to Plouton but to Dionysus, as Dionysus himself had the strange surname of 'the gaping one', though despite this the notion that the wine god in his quality as the Lord of the Underworld does not appear on the surface of the hymn. People would not be able to detect the hidden meaning it if it wasn\u2019t for archaic vase portrayals.\" ''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter'' [pp. 34, 35].\n\n\"The Hymn to Demeter later mentions that Queen Metaneira of Eleusis later offers the disguised Demeter a beaker of sweet wine, something that Demeter refuses on the grounds that it would be against themis, the very nature of order and justice, for her to drink red wine and she instead invents a new beverage called kykeon to drink instead. The fact that Demeter refuses to drink wine on the grounds that it would be against themis indicates that she is well aware of who Persephone's abductor is, that it is the Subterranean cover name of Dionysus. The critic of the mysteries, the severe philosopher Herakleitos once declared \"Hades is the same as Dionysos.\" The subterranean wine god was the ravisher, so how could Demeter accept something that was his gift to mankind\" [p. 40]</ref> votive marble images<ref>''Summary of Karl Ker\u00e9nyi:''\n\n\"The book later refers to Herakles initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries so that he may enter the Underworld. In the iconography after his initiation Herakles in shown wearing a fringed white garment with a Dionysian deerskin thrown over it. Kore is shown with her mother Demeter and a snake twined around the Mystery basket, foreshadowing the secret, as making friends with snakes was Dionysian [p. 58].\nThe god of the Anthesteria was Dionysus, who celebrated his marriage in Athens amid flowers, the opening of wine jars, and the rising up of the souls of the dead [p. 149].\nThere are two reliefs in a marble votive relief of the fourth century BC. One depicts Kore crowning her mother Demeter, the deities at the second altar are Persephone and her husband Dionysus as the recumbent god has the features of the bearded Dionysus rather than of Plouton. In his right hand, he raises not a cornucopia, the symbol of wealth, but a wine vessel and in his left, he bears the goblet for the wine. Over their heads an inscription reads \"To the God and Goddess\" [pp. 151, 152].\nThe fragments of a gilded jar cover of the Kerch type show Dionysus, Demeter, little Ploutos, Kore, and a curly-haired boy clad in a long garment, one of the first son's of the Eleusinian king who was the first to be initiated.\nOn another vase, Dionysus sits on his omphalos with his thryrsos in his left hand, sitting opposite Demeter, looking at each other severely. Kore is shown moving from Demeter towards Dionysus, as if trying to reconcile them [p. 162]. ''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter''</ref> and epithets<ref>''Summary of Karl Ker\u00e9nyi:''\n\nKore and Thea are two different duplications of Persephone; Plouton and Theos are duplications of the subterranean Dionysus. The duplication of the mystery god as subterranean father and subterranean son, as Father Zagreus and the child Zagreus, husband and son of Persephone, has more to do with the mysteries of Dionysus than with the Eleusinian Mysteries.

The Byzantine Greek encyclopedia, ''[[Suda]]'' (c. tenth century), stated: <blockquote>Sabazios&nbsp;... is the same as Dionysos. He acquired this form of address from the rite pertaining to him; for the barbarians call the bacchic cry \"sabazein\". Hence some of the Greeks too follow suit and call the cry \"sabasmos\"; thereby Dionysos [becomes] Sabazios. They also used to call \"saboi\" those places that had been dedicated to him and his [[Bacchantes]]&nbsp;... Demosthenes [in the speech] \"On Behalf of Ktesiphon\" [mentions them]. Some say that Saboi is the term for those who are dedicated to Sabazios, that is to Dionysos, just as those [dedicated] to Bakkhos [are] Bakkhoi. They say that Sabazios and Dionysos are the same. Thus some also say that the Greeks call the Bakkhoi Saboi.<ref>Sudas, under \"Sabazios\", \"saboi\"; Sider, David. \"Notes on Two Epigrams of Philodemus\".

Lane has taken pains to dismiss this widespread conflation: Lane, \"Towards a definition of the iconography of Sabazios\", ''Numen''  '''27''' (1980:9\u201333), and ''Corpus Cultis Jovis Sabazii:'', in ''\u00c9tudes Pr\u00e9liminaires aux Religions Orientales dans l'Empire Romain: Conclusions'' '''100'''.3  (Leiden, etc: Brill) 1989.</ref>\n\nSeveral ancient sources record an apparently widespread belief in the classical world that the god worshiped by the [[Judaism|Jewish]] people, [[Yahweh]], was identifiable as Dionysus or [[Liber]] via his identification with Sabazios. Tacitus, Lydus, Cornelius Labeo, and Plutarch all either made this association, or discussed it as an extant belief (though some, like Tacitus, specifically brought it up in order to reject it). According to Plutarch, one of the reasons for the identification is that Jews were reported to hail their god with the words \"Euoe\" and \"Sabi\", a cry typically associated with the worship of Sabazius. According to scholar Sean McDonough, it is possible that Plutarch's sources had confused the cry of \"Iao Sabaoth\" (typically used by Greek speakers in reference to Yahweh) with the Sabazian cry of \"Euoe Saboe\", originating the confusion and conflation of the two deities. The cry of \"Sabi\" could also have been conflated with the Jewish term \"sabbath\", adding to the evidence the ancients saw that Yahweh and Dionysus/Sabazius were the same deity. Further bolstering this connection would have been coins used by the [[Maccabees]] that included imagery linked to the worship of Dionysus such as grapes, vine leaves, and cups. However the belief that the Jewish god was identical with Dionysus/Sabazius was widespread enough that a coin dated to 55 BC depicting a kneeling king was labelled \"Bacchus Judaeus\" (''BACCHIVS IVDAEVS''), and in 139 BC praetor [[Cornelius Scipio Hispalus]] deported Jewish people for attempting to \"infect the Roman customs with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius\".<ref>McDonough 1999, pp. 88\u201390</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Roman - Sarcophagus Depicting the Birth of Dionysus - Walters 2333.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Birth of Dionysus, on a small sarcophagus that may have been made for a child ([[Walters Art Museum]])<ref>{{cite web|publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]|url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/16574|title= Sarcophagus Depicting the Birth of Dionysus}}</ref>]]\nVarious different accounts and traditions existed in the ancient world regarding the parentage, birth, and life of Dionysus on earth, complicated by his several rebirths. By the first century BC, some mythographers had attempted to harmonize the various accounts of Dionysus' birth into a single narrative involving not only multiple births, but two or three distinct manifestations of the god on earth throughout history in different lifetimes. The historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] said that according to \"some writers of myths\" there were two gods named Dionysus, an older one, who was the son of Zeus and Persephone,<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4A*.html#4 4.4.1].</ref> but that the \"younger one also inherited the deeds of the older, and so the men of later times, being unaware of the truth and being deceived because of the identity of their names thought there had been but one Dionysus.\"<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4A*.html#4 4.4.5].</ref> He also said that Dionysus \"was thought to have two forms...the ancient one having a long beard, because all men in early times wore long beards, the younger one being youthful and effeminate and young.\"<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4A*.html#5 4.5.2].</ref>\n\n[[File:Dionysus, marble bust Knossos, 2nd century AD, AMH, 145410.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Marble bust of youthful Dionysus.

According to Diodorus, Dionysus was originally the son of Zeus and [[Persephone]] (or alternately, Zeus and [[Demeter]]). This is the same horned Dionysus described by Hyginus and Nonnus in later accounts, and the Dionysus worshiped by the Orphics, who was dismembered by the Titans and then reborn. Nonnus calls this Dionysus [[Zagreus]], while Diodorus says he is also considered identical with [[Sabazius]].<ref name=diodiii/> However, unlike Hyginus and Nonnus, Diodorus does not provide a birth narrative for this incarnation of the god. It was this Dionysus who was said to have taught mortals how use use oxen to plow the fields, rather than doing so by hand. His worshipers were said to have honored him for this by depicting him with horns.<ref name=diodiii/>\n[[File:Mascherone di dioniso in bronzo, gi\u00e0 attacco di un manico in una situla o simile, 200-100 ac. ca.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Bronze mask depicting Dionysus bearded and horned, 200 BC \u2013 100 AD.

In it, he described how Zeus \"intended to make a new Dionysos grow up, a bullshaped copy of the older Dionysos\" who was the Egyptian god Osiris. (Dionysiaca 4)<ref>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 4. 268 ff (trans. Rouse)</ref> Zeus took the shape of a serpent (\"''drakon''\"), and \"ravished the maidenhood of unwedded Persephoneia.\" According to Nonnus, though Persephone was \"the consort of the blackrobed king of the underworld\", she remained a virgin, and had been hidden in a cave by her mother to avoid the many gods who were her suitors, because \"all that dwelt in Olympos were bewitched by this one girl, rivals in love for the marriageable maid.\" (Dionysiaca 5)<ref>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 5. 562 ff (trans. Rouse)</ref> After her union with Zeus, Perseophone's womb \"swelled with living fruit\", and she gave birth to a horned baby, named Zagreus. Zagreus, despite his infancy, was able to climb onto the throne of Zeus and brandish his lightning bolts, marking him a Zeus' heir. Hera saw this and alerted the Titans, who smeared their faces with chalk and ambushed the infant Zagreus \"while he contemplated his changeling countenance reflected in a mirror.\" They attacked him. However, according to Nonnus, \"where his limbs had been cut piecemeal by the Titan steel, the end of his life was the beginning of a new life as Dionysos.\" He began to change into many different forms in which he returned the attack, including Zeus, Kronos, a baby, and \"a mad youth with the flower of the first down marking his rounded chin with black.\" He then transformed into several animals to attack the assembled Titans, including a lion, a wild horse, a horned serpent, a tiger, and, finally, a bull. Hera intervened, killing the bull with a shout, and the Titans finally slaughtered him and cut him into pieces. Zeus attacked the Titans and had them imprisoned in [[Tartaros]]. This caused the mother of the Titans, [[Gaia]], to suffer, and her symptoms were seen across the whole world, resulting in fires and floods, and boiling seas. Zeus took pity on her, and in order to cool down the burning land, he caused great rains to [[Flood myth|flood the world]]. (Dionysiaca 6)<ref>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 6. 155 ff (trans.

As a result, the Orphics considered him the son of Persephone, and believed that he had been dismembered by the [[Titans (mythology)|Titans]] and then reborn. The myth of the dismemberment of Dionysus was alluded to as early as the fourth century BC by [[Plato]] in his ''[[Phaedo]]'', in which Socrates claims that the initiations of the Dionysian Mysteries are similar to those of the philosophic path. Late Neoplatonists such as [[Damascius]] explored the implications of this at length.<ref>Damascius, Commentary on the Phaedo, I, 1\u201313 and 165\u2013172, see in translation Westerink, The Greek Commentaries on Plato's Phaedo, vol. II, The Prometheus Trust, Westbury, 2009</ref> The dismemberment of Dionysus (the ''[[sparagmos]]'') is often considered to be the most important myth of Orphism.<ref>Nilsson, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1508326?seq=1 p. 202] calls it \"the cardinal myth of Orphism\"; Guthrie, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-C6wNyrxUO8C&pg=PA107 p. 107], describes the myth as \"the central point of Orphic story\", Linforth, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008294699;view=1up;seq=333 p. 307] says it is \"commonly regarded as essentially and peculiarly Orphic and the very core of the Orphic religion\", and Parker 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dsOEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA495 p. 495], writes that \"it has been seen as the Orphic 'arch-myth'.</ref>\n\nMany modern sources identify this \"Orphic Dionysus\" with the god [[Zagreus]], though this name does not seem to have been used by any of the ancient Orphics, who simply called him Dionysus.<ref>According to Gantz, p. 118, 'Orphic sources preserved seem not to use the name \"Zagreus\", and according to  West 1983, p. 153, the 'name was probably not used in the Orphic narrative'. Edmonds 1999, p. 37 n. 6 says: 'Lobeck 1892 seems to be responsible for the use of the name Zagreus for the Orphic Dionysos. As Linforth noticed, \"It is a curious thing that the name Zagreus does not appear in any Orphic poem or fragment, nor is it used by any author who refers to Orpheus\" (Linforth 1941:[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008294699;view=1up;seq=337 311]). In his reconstruction of the story, however, Lobeck made extensive use of the fifth-century epic of Nonnos, who does use the name Zagreus, and later scholars followed his cue. The association of Dionysos with Zagreus appears first explicitly in a fragment of Callimachus preserved in the Etymologicum Magnum (fr. 43.117 P), with a possible earlier precedent in the fragment from Euripides ''Cretans'' (fr. 472 Nauck). Earlier evidence, however, (e.g., ''Alkmaionis'' fr. 3 PEG; Aeschylus frr. 5, 228) suggests that Zagreus was often identified with other deities.'</ref> As pieced together from various ancient sources, the reconstructed story, usually given by modern scholars, goes as follows.<ref>West 1983, pp. 73\u201374, provides a detailed reconstruction with numerous cites to ancient sources, with a summary on p. 140.

He was torn apart and boiled by the sons of Gaia, or \"earth born\", symbolizing the harvesting and wine-making process.

Hyginus writes that Liber was torn apart by the Titans, so Jove took the fragments of his heart and put them into a drink which he gave to [[Semele]], the daughter of Harmonia and [[Cadmus]], king and founder of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]. This resulted in Semele becoming pregnant. [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] appeared to Semele in the form of her nurse, Beroe, and told her: \"Daughter, ask Jove to come to you as he comes to Juno, so you may know what pleasure it is to sleep with a god.\" When Semele requested that Jove do so, she was killed by a thunderbolt. Jove then took the infant Liber from her womb, and put him in the care of [[Nysus]]. Hyginus states that \"for this reason he is called Dionysus, and also the one with two mothers\" (''dim\u0113t\u014dr'').<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' CLXVII</ref>\n\nNonnus describes how, when life was rejuvenated after the flood, it was lacking in revelry in the absence of Dionysus. \"The [[Horae|Seasons]], those daughters of the lichtgang, still joyless, plaited garlands for the gods only of meadow-grass. For Wine was lacking. Without Bacchos to inspire the dance, its grace was only half complete and quite without profit; it charmed only the eyes of the company, when the circling dancer moved in twists and turns with a tumult of footsteps, having only nods for words, hand for mouth, fingers for voice.\" Zeus declared that he would send his son Dionysus to teach mortals how to grow grapes and make wine, to alleviate their toil, war, and suffering. After he became protector of humanity, Zeus promises, Dionysus would struggle on earth, but be received \"by the bright upper air to shine beside Zeus and to share the courses of the stars.\" (Dionysiaca 7).<ref>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 7. 14 ff (trans. Rouse)</ref>\n\n[[File:Sebastiano_Ricci_-_Dionysus_(1695).jpg|thumb|left|''\"Jove and Semele\"'' (c. 1695) by [[Sebastiano Ricci]].]]\nThe mortal princess Semele then had a dream, in which Zeus destroyed a fruit tree with a bolt of lightning, but did not harm the fruit. He sent a bird to bring him one of the fruits, and sewed it into his thigh, so that he would be both mother and father to the new Dionysus. She saw the bull-shaped figure of a man emerge from his thigh, and then came to the realization that she herself had been the tree. Her father Cadmus, fearful of the prophetic dream, instructed Semele to make sacrifices to Zeus. Zeus came to Semele in her bed, adorned with various symbols of Dionysus. He transformed into a snake, and \"Zeus made long wooing, and shouted \"Euoi!\" as if the winepress were near, as he begat his son who would love the cry.\" Immediately, Semele's bed and chambers were overgrown with vines and flowers, and the earth laughed. Zeus then spoke to Semele, revealing his true identity, and telling her to be happy: \"you bring forth a son who shall not die, and you I will call immortal. Happy woman! you have conceived a son who will make mortals forget their troubles, you shall bring forth joy for gods and men.\" (Dionysiaca 7).<ref>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 7. 139 ff (trans. Rouse)</ref>\n\nDuring her pregnancy, Semele rejoiced in the knowledge that her son would be divine. She dressed herself in garlands of flowers and wreathes of ivy, and would run barefoot to the meadows and forests to frolic whenever she heard music. Hera became envious, and feared that Zeus would replace her with Semele as queen of Olympus. She went to Semele in the guise of an old woman who had been Cadmus' wet nurse. She made Semele jealous of the attention Zeus' gave to Hera, compared with their own brief liaison, and provoked her to request Zeus to appear before her in his full godhood. Semele prayed to Zeus that he show himself. Zeus answered her prayers, but warned her than no other mortals had ever seen him as he held his lightning bolts. Semele reached out to touch them, and was burnt to ash. (Dionysiaca 8).<ref>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 8. (trans. Rouse)</ref> But the infant Dionysus survived, and Zeus rescued him from the flames, sewing him into his thigh. \"So the rounded thigh in labour became female, and the boy too soon born was brought forth, but not in a mother\u2019s way, having passed from a mother\u2019s womb to a father\u2019s.\" (Dionysiaca 9). At his birth, he had a pair of horns shaped like a crescent moon. The [[Horae|Seasons]] crowned him with ivy and flowers, and wrapped horned snakes around his own horns.<ref name=dion.9/>\n\nAn alternate birth narrative is given by Diodorus from the Egyptian tradition. In it, Dionysus is the son of [[Amun|Ammon]], who Diodorus regards both as the creator god and a quasi-historical king of [[Libya]]. Ammon had married the goddess [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], but he had an affair with [[Amaltheia]], who bore Dionysus. Ammon feared Rhea's wrath if she were to discover the child, so he took the infant Dionysus to [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]] (Dionysus' traditional childhood home). Ammon brought Dionysus into a cave where he was to be cared for by Nysa, a daughter of the hero [[Aristaeus]].<ref name=diodiii/> Dionysus grew famous due to his skill in the arts, his beauty, and his strength. It was said that he discovered the art of winemaking during his boyhood. His fame brought him to the attention of Rhea, who was furious with Ammon for his deception. She attempted to bring Dionysus under her own power but, unable to do so, she left Ammon and married [[Cronus]].<ref name=diodiii/>\n\n====Interpretation====\n[[File:Delos Museum Mosaik Dionysos 05.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic Greek]] [[mosaic]] depicting the god [[Dionysos]] as a winged [[daimon]] riding on a tiger, from [[Mosaics of Delos|the House of Dionysos]] at [[Delos]] (which [[History of Delos|was once controlled]] by [[History of Athens|Athens]]) in the [[South Aegean]] [[Administrative regions of Greece|region]] of [[Greece]], late second century BC, [[Archaeological Museum of Delos]]]]\nEven in antiquity, the account of Dionysus' birth to a mortal woman led some to argue that he had been a historical figure who became deified over time, a suggestion of [[Euhemerism]] (an explanation of mythic events having roots in mortal history) often applied to demi-gods. The fourth century Roman emperor and philosopher [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] encountered examples of this belief, and wrote arguments against it. In his letter ''To the Cynic Heracleios'', Julian wrote \"I have heard many people say that Dionysus was a mortal man because he was born of Semele, and that he became a god through his knowledge of [[theurgy]] and the Mysteries, and like our lord Heracles for his royal virtue was translated to Olympus by his father Zeus.\" However, to Julian, the myth of Dionysus's birth (and that of Heracles) stood as an allegory for a deeper spiritual truth. The birth of Dionysus, Julian argues, was \"no birth but a divine manifestation\" to Semele, who foresaw that a physical manifestation of the god Dionysus would soon appear. However, Semele was impatient for the god to come, and began revealing his mysteries too early; for her transgression, she was struck down by Zeus. When Zeus decided it was time to impose a new order on humanity, for it to \"pass from the nomadic to a more civilized mode of life\", he sent his son Dionysus from India as a god made visible, spreading his worship and giving the vine as a symbol of his manifestation among mortals. In Julian's interpretation, the Greeks \"called Semele the mother of Dionysus because of the prediction that she had made, but also because the god honored her as having been the first prophetess of his advent while it was yet to be.\" The allegorical myth of the birth of Dionysus, per Julian, was developed to express both the history of these events and encapsulate the truth of his birth outside the generative processes of the mortal world, but entering into it, though his true birth was directly from Zeus along into the [[Neoplatonism|intelligible realm]].<ref name=julian>Julian, trans. by Emily Wilmer Cave Wright.

Hermes gave Dionysus to the Lamides, or daughters of Lamos, who were river nymphs. But Hera drove the Lamides mad, and caused them to attack Dionysus, who was rescued by Hermes. Hermes next brought the infant to [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]] for fostering by her attendant Mystis, who taught him the rites of the mysteries (Dionysiaca 9). In Apollodorus' account, Hermes instructed Ino to raise Dionysus as a girl, in order to hide him from Hera's wrath.<ref>Apollodorus, The Library, with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes.

The [[Homeric hymn|''Homeric Hymn 1 to Dionysus'']] places it \"far from [[Phoenicia]], near to the [[Nile|Egyptian stream]]\".<ref>''Homeric Hymn 1 to Dionysus'' : \u2018There is a certain Nysa, mountain high, with forests thick, in Phoinike afar, close to Aigyptos' (Egypt's) streams.\u2019</ref> Others placed it in Anatolia, or in [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] (\"away in the west beside a great ocean\"), in Ethiopia (Herodotus), or [[Arabia]] (Diodorus Siculus).<ref>''Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 2. 3'' (trans.

Young Dionysus was also said to have been one of the many famous pupils of the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]].

In [[Phrygia]] the goddess [[Cybele]], better known to the Greeks as Rhea, cured him and taught him her religious rites, and he set out on a progress through Asia teaching the people the cultivation of the vine. The most famous part of his wanderings is his expedition to [[India]], which is said to have lasted several years. According to a legend, when [[Alexander the Great]] reached a city called Nysa near the [[Indus river]], the locals said that their city was founded by Dionysus in the distant past and their city was dedicated to the god Dionysus.<ref>[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis of Alexander]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/arrian-anabasis_alexander/1976/pb_LCL269.3.xml 5.1.1\u20132.2]</ref> These travels took something of the form of military conquests; according to [[Diodorus Siculus]] he conquered the whole world except for Britain and [[Ethiopia]].<ref>Bull, 253</ref>\n\nAnother myth according to [[Nonnus]] involves [[Ampelos|Ampelus]], a [[satyr]], who was loved by Dionysus.  As related by [[Ovid]], Ampelus became the constellation ''Vindemitor'', or the \"grape-gatherer\": <blockquote><small>...not so will the Grape-gatherer escape thee. The origin of that constellation also can be briefly told. 'Tis said that the unshorn Ampelus, son of a nymph and a satyr, was loved by Bacchus on the Ismarian hills.

Pentheus, as well as his mother [[Agave (Theban princess)|Agave]] and his aunts [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]] and [[Autonoe]], disbelieve Dionysus' divine birth. Despite the warnings of the blind prophet [[Tiresias]], they deny him worship and denounce him for inspiring the women of Thebes to madness.\n\nDionysus uses his divine powers to drive Pentheus insane, then invites him to spy on the ecstatic rituals of the [[Maenad]]s, in the woods of [[Mount Cithaeron]]. Pentheus, hoping to witness a sexual [[orgy]], hides himself in a tree. The Maenads spot him; maddened by Dionysus, they take him to be a mountain-dwelling [[lion]], and attack him with their bare hands. Pentheus' aunts and his mother Agave are among them, and they rip him limb from limb. Agave mounts his head on a pike, and takes the trophy to her father Cadmus. The madness passes. Dionysus arrives in his true, divine form, banishes Agave and her sisters, and transforms Cadmus and his wife [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] into serpents.

Dionysus fled and took refuge with [[Thetis]], and sent a [[drought]] which stirred the people to revolt. The god then drove King Lycurgus insane and had him slice his own son into pieces with an axe in the belief that he was a patch of ivy, a plant holy to Dionysus. An [[oracle]] then claimed that the land would stay dry and barren as long as Lycurgus lived, and his people had him [[drawn and quartered]]. Appeased by the king's death, Dionysus lifted the curse. This story is told in Homer's ''Iliad'' 6.136\u2013137.

When he was aboard, they sailed not to Naxos but to Asia, intending to sell him as a slave. This time the god turned the mast and oars into snakes, and filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes so that the sailors went mad and, leaping into the sea, were turned into dolphins. In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]],'' Bacchus begins this story as a young child found by the pirates, but transforms to a divine adult when on board.\n\nMany of the Dionysus myths involve the god, whose birth was secret, defending his godhead against skeptics. Malcolm Bull notes that \"It is a measure of Bacchus's ambiguous position in classical mythology that he, unlike the other Olympians, had to use a boat to travel to and from the islands with which he is associated\".<ref>Bull, 245\u2013247, 247 quoted</ref> Paola Corrente notes that in many sources, the incident with the pirates happens towards the end of Dionysus' time among mortals.

In the latter, Apollodorus tells how after having been hidden away from Hera's wrath, Dionysus traveled the world opposing those who denied his godhood, finally proving it when he transformed his pirate captors into dolphins. After this, the culmination of his life on earth was his descent to retrieve his mother from the underworld. He renamed his mother [[Semele|Thyone]], and ascended with her to heaven, where she became a goddess.<ref>Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' book 3</ref> In this variant of the myth, it is implied that Dionysus both must prove his godhood to mortals, then also legitimize his place on Olympus by proving his lineage and elevating his mother to divine status, before taking his place among the Olympic gods.<ref name=corrente2012/>\n\n===Secondary myths===\n[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|left|240px|''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' by [[Titian]], at the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in London.]]\n[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|left|240px|''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' (1822) by [[Antoine-Jean Gros]].]]\n\n====Midas' golden touch====\nDionysus discovered that his old school master and foster father, [[Silenus]], had gone missing. The old man had wandered away drunk, and was found by some peasants who carried him to their king [[Midas]] (alternatively, he passed out in Midas' rose garden). The king recognized him hospitably, feasting him for ten days and nights while Silenus entertained with stories and songs. On the eleventh day, Midas brought Silenus back to Dionysus. Dionysus offered the king his choice of reward.\n\nMidas asked that whatever he might touch would turn to gold. Dionysus consented, though was sorry that he had not made a better choice. Midas rejoiced in his new power, which he hastened to put to the test. He touched and turned to gold an oak twig and a stone, but his joy vanished when he found that his bread, meat, and wine also turned to gold. Later, when his daughter embraced him, she too turned to gold.\n\nThe horrified king strove to divest the [[Midas Touch]], and he prayed to Dionysus to save him from starvation. The god consented, telling Midas to wash in the river [[Pactolus]]. As he did so, the power passed into them, and the river sands turned gold: this [[etiological myth]] explained the gold sands of the Pactolus.\n\n====Other myths====\nWhen [[Hephaestus]] bound [[Hera]] to a magical chair, Dionysus got him drunk and brought him back to Olympus after he passed out.\n\nWhen [[Theseus]] abandoned [[Ariadne]] sleeping on Naxos, Dionysus found and married her. She bore him a son named Oenopion, but he committed suicide or was killed by [[Perseus]]. In some variants, he had her crown put into the heavens as the constellation Corona; in others, he descended into [[Hades]] to restore her to the gods on Olympus. Another account claims Dionysus ordered Theseus to abandon Ariadne on the island of Naxos, for Dionysus had seen her as Theseus carried her onto the ship and had decided to marry her.\n\nA third descent by Dionysus to Hades is invented by [[Aristophanes]] in his comedy ''[[The Frogs]]''. Dionysus, as patron of the Athenian dramatic festival, the ''Dionysia'', wants to bring back to life one of the great tragedians.

Peters suggests the original meaning as \"he who runs among the trees\", or that of a \"runner in the woods\". Janda (2010) accepts the etymology but proposes the more cosmological interpretation of \"he who impels the (world-)tree\". This interpretation explains how ''Nysa'' could have been re-interpreted from a meaning of \"tree\" to the name of a mountain: the [[axis mundi]] of [[Indo-European mythology]] is represented both as a [[world-tree]] and as a [[world-mountain]].<ref>see Janda (2010), 16\u201344 for a detailed account.</ref>\n\nDionysus is also closely associated with the transition between summer and autumn. In the Mediterranean summer, marked by the rising of the dog star [[Sirius]], the weather becomes extremely hot, but it is also a time when the promise of coming harvests grow. Late summer, when [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is at the center of the sky, was the time of the grape harvest in ancient Greece. Plato describes the gifts of this season as the fruit that is harvested as well as Dionysian joy. Pindar describes the \"pure light of high summer\" as closely associated with Dionysus and possibly even an embodiment of the god himself. An image of Dionysus' birth from Zeus' thigh call him \"the light of Zeus\" (''Dios phos'') and associate him with the light of Sirius.<ref name=Kerenyi/>\n\n===In classical art===\n[[File:Table support with a Dionysiac group (AD 170-180) (3470740119).jpg|thumb|left|Marble table support adorned by a group including [[Dionysos]], [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and a [[Satyr]]; Dionysos holds a [[rhyton]] (drinking vessel) in the shape of a panther; traces of [[Red hair|red]] and [[Blond|yellow colour]] are preserved on [[Hair color|the hair]] of the figures and the branches; from an [[Asia Minor]] workshop, 170\u2013180 AD, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]], Greece]]\n\nThe god, and still more often his followers, were commonly depicted in the painted [[pottery of Ancient Greece]], much of which made to hold wine.

The [[Furietti Centaurs]] and ''[[Sleeping Hermaphroditus]]'' reflect related subjects, which had by this time become drawn into the Dionysian orbit.<ref>Smith 1991, 127\u2013154</ref> The marble [[Dancer of Pergamon]] is an original, as is the bronze [[Dancing Satyr of Mazara del Vallo]], a recent recovery from the sea.\n\nThe Dionysian world by the Hellenistic period is a hedonistic but safe [[pastoral]] into which other semi-divine creatures of the countryside have been co-opted, such as [[centaur]]s, [[nymph]]s, and the gods [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and [[Hermaphroditus|Hermaphrodite]].<ref>Smith 1991, 127, 131, 133</ref> \"Nymph\" by this stage \"means simply an ideal female of the Dionysian outdoors, a non-wild bacchant\".<ref>Smith 1991, 130</ref> Hellenistic sculpture also includes for the first time large genre subjects of children and peasants, many of whom carry Dionysian attributes such as ivy wreaths, and \"most should be seen as part of his realm.

This tradition derived from a quotation by the Roman comedian [[Terence]] (c. 195/185 \u2013 c. 159 BC) which became a popular proverb in the [[Early Modern period]]: ''[[Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus]]'' (\"without [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Bacchus]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] freezes\"). Its simplest level of meaning is that love needs food and wine to thrive. Artwork based on this saying was popular during the period 1550\u20131630, especially in [[Northern Mannerism]] in [[Prague]] and the [[Low Countries]], as well as by [[Rubens]]. Because of his association with the vine harvest, Bacchus became the god of autumn, and he and his followers were often shown in sets depicting the seasons.<ref>Malcolm Bull, ''The Mirror of the Gods, How Renaissance Artists Rediscovered the Pagan Gods'', Oxford UP, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0195219234}}</ref>\n\n===Modern literature and philosophy===\n[[File:Los borrachos o el triunfo de Baco 1629 Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|220px|''[[The Triumph of Bacchus]]'', [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], c. 1629]]\n[[File:Cornelis de Vos - El triunfo de Baco.jpg|thumb|220px|The triumph of [[Bacchus]] by [[Cornelis de Vos]].]]\n<!--this section has been worked into connected encyclopedic text: please do not add bulletted items of trivia-->\n\nDionysus has remained an inspiration to artists, philosophers and writers into the [[modern era]]. In ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872), the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] proposed that a tension between [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] aesthetic principles underlay the development of [[Greek tragedy]]; Dionysus represented what was unrestrained chaotic and irrational, while Apollo represented the rational and ordered. This concept of a rivalry or opposition between Dionysus and Apollo has been characterized as a \"modern myth\", as it is the invention of modern thinkers like Nietzsche and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], and is not found in classical sources. However, the acceptance and popularity of this theme in Western culture has been so great, that its undercurrent has influenced the conclusions of classical scholarship.<ref>Isler-Ker\u00e9nyi, C., & Watson, W.

Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76w9x.13</ref>\n\nNietzsche also claimed that the oldest forms of Greek Tragedy were entirely based upon the suffering Dionysus. In Nietzsche's 1886 work ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', and later ''[[The Twilight of the Idols]]'', ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'' and ''[[Ecce Homo]]'', Dionysus is conceived as the embodiment of the unrestrained [[will to power]]. In ''The Hellenic Religion of the Suffering God'' (1904), and ''Dionysus and Early Dionysianism'' (1921), the poet [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] elaborates the theory of [[Dionysianism]], tracing the origins of literature, and [[tragedy]] in particular, to ancient Dionysian mysteries. [[Karl Ker\u00e9nyi]] characterizes Dionysus as representative of the psychological life force (Greek ''Zo\u00ea'').<ref>Kerenyi, K., ''Dionysus: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life'' (Princeton/Bollingen, 1976).</ref> Other psychological interpretations place Dionysus' [[emotionality]] in the foreground, focusing on the [[joy]], [[Fear|terror]] or [[hysteria]] associated with the god.<ref>Jeanmaire, H.

Also, the manner of death is different; in the most common myth, Dionysus was torn to pieces and eaten by the [[titan (mythology)|titan]]s, but \"eventually restored to a new life\" from the heart that was left over.<ref>Detienne, Marcel.

The discrepancies between the two stories, including their resolutions, have led many scholars to regard the Dionysus story as radically different from the one about Jesus, except for the parallel of the arrest, which is a detail that appears in many biographies as well.<ref>Dalby, Andrew (2005). ''The Story of Bacchus''. London: British Museum Press.</ref>\n\n===Sacred food and drink===\nOther elements, such as the celebration by a ritual meal of bread and wine, also have parallels.<ref name=Powell/> The [[omophagia]] was the Dionysian act of eating raw flesh and drinking wine to consume the god. Within Orphism, it was believed that consuming the meat and wine was symbolic of the Titans eating the flesh (meat) and blood (wine) of Dionysus and that, by participating in the omophagia, Dionysus' followers could achieve communion with the god. Powell, in particular, argues that precursors to the Catholic notion of [[transubstantiation]] can be found in Dionysian religion.<ref name=Powell/>\n\n===Other parallels===\nE. Kessler has argued that the Dionysian cult developed into strict [[monotheism]] by the fouth century AD; together with [[Mithraism]] and other sects, the cult formed an instance of \"pagan monotheism\" in direct competition with [[Early Christianity]] during [[Late Antiquity]].<ref>E. Kessler, ''Dionysian Monotheism in Nea Paphos, Cyprus''. Symposium on ''Pagan Monotheism in the Roman Empire'', Exeter, 17\u201320 July 2006 [http://www.huss.ex.ac.uk/classics/conferences/pagan_monotheism/abstracts.html Abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032154/http://www.huss.ex.ac.uk/classics/conferences/pagan_monotheism/abstracts.html |date=2008-04-21 }})</ref> Scholars from the sixteenth century onwards, especially [[Gerard Vossius]], also discussed the parallels between the biographies of Dionysus/Bacchus and [[Moses]] (Vossius named his sons [[Dionysius Vossius|Dionysius]] and [[Isaac Vossius|Isaac]]). Such comparisons surface in details of paintings by Poussin.<ref>Bull, 240\u2013241</ref>\n\n[[Tacitus]], [[John the Lydian]], and [[Cornelius Labeo]] all identify Yahweh with the Greek god Dionysus.{{sfn|McDonough|1999|page=88}} Jews themselves frequently used symbols that were also associated with Dionysus such as [[kylix]]es, [[amphora]]e, leaves of ivy, and clusters of grapes.{{sfn|Smith|Cohen|1996a|page=233}} In his ''[[Moralia|Quaestiones Convivales]]'', the Greek writer [[Plutarch of Chaeronea]] writes that the Jews hail their god with cries of \"Euoi\" and \"Sabi\", phrases associated with the worship of Dionysus.<ref>[[Plutarch]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0312%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D6 ''Quaestiones Convivales'', Question VI]</ref>{{sfn|McDonough|1999|page=89}}{{sfn|Smith|Cohen|1996a|pages=232\u2013233}} According to Sean M. McDonough, Greek-speakers may have confused [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] words such as [[Sabbath]], [[Alleluia]], or even possibly some variant of the name Yahweh itself for more familiar terms associated with Dionysus.{{sfn|McDonough|1999|pages=89\u201390}}\n\n[[John Moles]] has argued that the Dionysian cult influenced early Christianity, and especially the way that Christians understood themselves as a \"new\" religion centered around a savior deity. In particular, he argues that the account of Christian origins in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] was heavily influenced by [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]''.<ref name=\"moles\"/> Moles also suggests that [[Paul the Apostle]] may have partially based his account of the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]]{{bibleref2c|1 Cor|11:23\u201326}} on the ritual meals performed by members of the Dionysian cult.<ref name=\"moles\"/>{{rp|96}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Dionysus Sarcophagus.jpg|Roman marble sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysos and the Seasons (circa 260\u2013270 AD)\nFile:Roman - Sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysus - Walters 2331 (2).jpg|Triumph of Dionysus\nFile:Exekias Dionysos Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2044 n2.jpg|The [[Dionysus Cup]], a sixth-century BC [[kylix]] with Dionysus sailing with the pirates he transformed to dolphins\nFile:Dionysos on a cheetah, Pella, Greece.jpg|Dionysos riding a [[leopard]], [[Kingdom of Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[mosaic]] from [[Pella]], Greece (fourth century BC)\nFile:Dionysos Sardanapalus.jpg|Statue of [[Dionysus Sardanapalus|Dionysus (Sardanapalus)]] ([[National Roman Museum|Museo Palazzo Massimo Alle Terme]], Rome)\nFile:Bronze Head of Dionysos.JPG|Bronze head of Dionysus (50 BC \u2013 50 AD) in the [[British Museum]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=460422&partId=1&people=130287&peoA=130287-3-17&page=1|title=British Museum \u2013 statue|publisher=}}</ref>\nFile:Remich Statue of Dionysus.JPG|Statue of Dionysus in [[Remich]] [[Luxembourg]]\nFile:Fane Table.jpg|A Bacchus themed table - the top was made in Florence (c. 1736) and the gilded wood base in Britain or Ireland (circa 1736\u20131740).\nFile:Bacchus (Giovanni Francesco Romanelli) - Nationalmuseum - 17103.tif|''Bacchus'' \u2013 [[Giovanni Francesco Romanelli]] (seventeenth century)\nFile:Dion\u00fcszosz amf\u00f3ra.jpg|Dionysian amphora\nFile:Dion\u00fcszosz kancs\u00f3.jpg|Dionysian jug\nFile:3326 - Athens - Sto\u00e0 of Attalus Museum - Head of Dyonisos - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 9 2009.jpg|[[Terracotta]] vase in the shape of Dionysus' head (circa 410 BC) \u2013 on display in the [[Ancient Agora Museum]] in [[Athens]], housed in the [[Stoa of Attalus]]\nFile:Amphora with cult mask of Dionysus, by the Antimenes Painter, arounbd 520 BC, Altes Museum Berlin (13718436013).jpg|Amphora with cult mask of Dionysus, by the Antimenes Painter, arounbd 520 BC, [[Altes Museum]]\nFile:Marble head of Dionysus, from the Gymnasium of Salamis, 2nd century AD, Cyprus Museum, Nicosia, Cyprus (22309811890).jpg|Marble head of Dionysus, from the Gymnasium of Salamis, second century AD, [[Cyprus Museum]], [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]]\nFile:Dionysos - Landesmuseum W\u00fcrttemberg.jpg|Cult mask of Dionysus from [[Boeotia]], fourth century BC\nFile:Marble_statuette_of_Dionysos_MET_DP367957.jpg|Marble statuette of Dionysos, early third century B.C, [[Metropolitan Museum]]\n\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Greece|Myths|Religion}}\n* [[Alpos]]\n* [[Apollonian and Dionysian]]\n* [[Ascolia]]\n* [[Bacchanalia]]\n* [[Dionysian Mysteries]]\n* [[Orgia]]\n* [[Theatre of Dionysus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* [[Aristides]], ''Aristides ex recensione Guilielmi Dindorfii, Volume 3'', [[Wilhelm Dindorf]], Weidmann, G.

However, more recent evidence has shown that Dionysus was in fact one of the earliest gods attested in mainland Greek culture.<ref name=iconography/> The earliest written records of Dionysus worship come from [[Mycenaean Greece]], specifically in and around the [[Palace of Nestor]] in [[Pylos]], dated to around 1300 BC.<ref name=Kerenyi>Ker\u00e9nyi, Karl. 1976. ''Dionysus''. Trans. Ralph Manheim, Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0691029156|978-0691029153}}</ref> The details of any religion surrounding Dionysus in this period are scant, and most evidence comes in the form only of his name, written as ''di-wo-nu-su-jo'' (\"Dionysoio\") in [[Linear B]], preserved on fragments of clay tablets that indicate a connection to offerings or payments of wine, which was described as being \"of Dionysoio\". References have also been uncovered to \"women of Oinoa\", the \"place of wine\", who may correspond to the Dionysian women of later periods.<ref name=Kerenyi/> Other Mycenaean records from Pylos record the worship of a god named Eleuther, who was the son of Zeus, and to whom oxen were sacrificed. The link to both Zeus and oxen, as well as etymological links between the name Eleuther or Eleutheros with the Latin name [[Liber|Liber Pater]], indicates that this may have been another name for Dionysus. According to [[K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi]], these clues suggest that even in the thirteenth century BC, the core religion of Dionysus was in place, as were his important myths. At [[Knossos]] in Minoan [[Crete]], men were often given the name \"Pentheus\", who is a figure in later Dionysian myth and which also means \"suffering\". Ker\u00e9nyi argued that to give such a name to one's child implies a strong religious connection, potentially not the separate character of Pentheus who suffers at the hands of Dionysus' followers in later myths, but as an epithet of Dionysus himself, whose mythology describes a god who must endure suffering before triumphing over it. According to Ker\u00e9nyi, the title of \"man who suffers\" likely originally referred to the god himself, only being applied to distinct characters as the myth developed.<ref name=Kerenyi/>\nThe oldest known image of Dionysus, accompanied by his name, is found on a [[dinos]] by the Attic potter [[Sophilos]] around 570 BC. By the seventh century, iconography found on pottery shows that Dionysus was already worshiped as more than just a god associated with wine. He was associated with weddings, death, sacrifice, and sexuality, and his retinue of satyrs and dancers was already established. A common theme in these early depictions was the metamorphosis, at the hand of the god, of his followers into hybrid creatures, usually represented by both tame and wild [[satyr]]s, representing the transition from civilized life back to nature as a means of escape.<ref name=iconography>Isler-Ker\u00e9nyi, C., & Watson, W.

The [[Rural Dionysia]] (or Lesser Dionysia) was one of the oldest festivals dedicated to Dionysus, begun in [[Attica]], and probably celebrated the cultivation of vines. It was held during the winter month of Poseideon (the time surrounding the winter solstice, modern December or January). The Rural Dionysia centered on a procession, during which participants carried phalluses, long loaves of bread, jars of water and wine as well as other offerings, and young girls carried baskets. The procession was followed by a series of dramatic performances and drama competitions.<ref name=athens_festivals>Sir Arthur Pickard-Cambridge. The Dramatic Festivals of Athens. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953 (2nd ed. 1968). {{ISBN|0-19-814258-7}}</ref>\n\nThe City Dionysia (or Great Dionysia) took place in urban centers such as [[Athens]] and [[Eleusis]], and was a later development, probably beginning during the sixth century BC. Held three months after the Rural Dionysia, the Greater festival fell near the spring equinox in the month of Elaphebolion (modern March or April). The procession of the City Dionysia was similar to that of the rural celebrations, but more elaborate, and led by participants carrying a wooden statue of Dionysus, and including sacrificial bulls and ornately dressed choruses. The dramatic competitions of the Greater Dionysia also featured more noteworthy poets and playwrights, and prizes for both dramatists and actors in multiple categories.<ref name=athens_festivals/><ref name=Brockett>Brockett, Oscar Gross (1968).

AD 100, [[British Museum]], [[London]].]]\nThe central religious cult of Dionysus is known as the Bacchic or [[Dionysian Mysteries]]. The exact origin of this religion is unknown, though [[Orpheus]] was said to have invented the mysteries of Dionysus.<ref name=\"Apollodorus1.3.2\">Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.3.2 ''Library and Epitome'', 1.3.2]. \"Orpheus also invented the mysteries of Dionysus, and having been torn in pieces by the Maenads he is buried in Pieria.\"</ref> Evidence suggests that many sources and rituals typically considered to be part of the similar [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic Mysteries]] actually belong to Dionysian mysteries.<ref name=iconography/> Some scholars have suggested that, additionally, there is no difference between the Dionysian mysteries and the mysteries of [[Persephone]], but that these were all facets of the same mystery religion, and that Dionysus and Persephone both had important roles in it.<ref name=iconography/><ref>Dickie, M.W. 1995. The Dionysiac Mysteries. In Pella, ZPE 109, 81-86.</ref> Previously considered to have been a primarily rural and fringe part of Greek religion, the major urban center of [[Athens]] played a major role in the development and spread of the Bacchic mysteries.<ref name=iconography/>\n\nThe Bacchic mysteries served an important role in creating ritual traditions for transitions in people's lives; originally primarily for men and male sexuality, but later also created space for ritualizing women's changing roles and celebrating changes of status in a woman's life. This was often symbolized by a meeting with the gods who rule over death and change, such as [[Hades]] and Persephone, but also with Dionysus' mother Semele, who probably served a role related to initiation into the mysteries.<ref name=iconography/>\n\nThe religion of Dionysus often included rituals involving the sacrifice of goats or bulls, and at least some participants and dancers wore wooden masks associated with the god. In some instances, records show the god participating in the ritual via a masked and clothed pillar, pole, or tree is used, while his worshipers eat bread and drink wine. The significance of masks and goats to the worship of Dionysus seems to date back to the earliest days of his worship, and these symbols have been found together at a [[Minoan]] tomb near [[Phaistos]] in Crete.<ref name=Kerenyi/>\n\n===Eleusinian mysteries===\n[[File:Hans von Aachen - Bacchus, Ceres and Amor (?) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Bacchus, Ceres and Amor'', (1595\u20131605).

A temple to the Triad was erected on the [[Aventine Hill]] in 493 BC, along with the institution of celebrating the festival of [[Liberalia]].

These Bacchic rituals were said to have included [[Omophagia|omophagic]] practices, such as pulling live animals apart and eating the whole of them raw. This practice served not only as a reenactment of the infant death and rebirth of Bacchus, but also as a means by which Bacchic practitioners produced \"enthusiasm\": etymologically, to let a god enter the practitioner's body or to have her become one with Bacchus.<ref>Russell, Bertrand.

Livy relates their various outrages against Rome's civil and religious laws and traditional morality (''[[mos maiorum]]''); a secretive, subversive and potentially revolutionary counter-culture. Livy's sources, and his own account of the cult, probably drew heavily on the Roman dramatic ''genre'' known as \"Satyr plays\", based on Greek originals.<ref>...\"the Bacchic passages in the Roman drama, taken over from their Greek models, presented a pejorative image of the Bacchic cult which predisposed the Romans towards persecution before the consul denounced the cult in 186.\" Robert Rouselle, Liber-Dionysus in Early Roman Drama, ''The Classical Journal'', 82, 3 (1987), p. 193.</ref><ref>\"Certainly it is hard to imagine anything less consistent with Roman [[mos maiorum]] than the anarchic hedonism of satyrs.

Modern scholarship treats much of Livy's account with skepticism; more certainly, a Senatorial edict, the ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]'' was distributed throughout Roman and allied Italy. It banned the former Bacchic cult organisations. Each meeting must seek prior senatorial approval through a [[praetor]]. No more than three women and two men were allowed at any one meeting, Those who defied the edict risked the death penalty.\n\nBacchus was conscripted into the official Roman pantheon as an aspect of Liber, and his festival was inserted into the [[Liberalia]]. In Roman culture, Liber, Bacchus and Dionysus became virtually interchangeable equivalents. Thanks to his mythology involving travels and struggles on earth, Bacchus became [[Euhemerism|euhemerised]] as a historical hero, conqueror, and founder of cities. He was a patron deity and founding hero at [[Leptis Magna]], birthplace of the emperor [[Septimius Severus]], who promoted his cult. In some Roman sources, the ritual procession of Bacchus in a tiger-drawn chariot, surrounded by maenads, satyrs and drunks, commemorates the god's triumphant return from the conquest of India. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] believed this to be the historical prototype for the [[Roman Triumph]].<ref>Pliny attributes the invention of the triumph to \"Father [[Liber]]\" (who by Pliny's time was identified with Bacchus and Dionysus): see Pliny, ''Historia Naturalis'', 7.57 (ed.

When quoting this in his ''Hymn to King Helios'', [[Julian (emperor)|Emperor Julian]] substituted Dionysus' name with that of [[Serapis]], whose Egyptian counterpart [[Osiris]] was also identified with Dionysus.<ref name=Julian_hymn>''[[Hymn to King Helios]]''</ref>\n\n===Worship from the Middle Ages to the Modern period===\n[[File:Paulus Bor - Bacchus - WGA02449.jpg|thumb|left|Bacchus by [[Paulus Bor]]]]\nThough the last known worshippers of the Greek and Roman gods were converted before 1000 AD,{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} there were several isolated instances of revived worship of Dionysus during the Medieval and early modern periods.

Nysa was regarded as the birthplace and first home of Dionysus. The divine marriage of Plouton and Persephone was celebrated on 'the meadow'. The dangerous region that Kore let herself be lured to in search of flowers was likely not originally connected to Plouton but to Dionysus, as Dionysus himself had the strange surname of 'the gaping one', though despite this the notion that the wine god in his quality as the Lord of the Underworld does not appear on the surface of the hymn. People would not be able to detect the hidden meaning it if it wasn\u2019t for archaic vase portrayals.\" ''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter'' [pp. 34, 35].\n\n\"The Hymn to Demeter later mentions that Queen Metaneira of Eleusis later offers the disguised Demeter a beaker of sweet wine, something that Demeter refuses on the grounds that it would be against themis, the very nature of order and justice, for her to drink red wine and she instead invents a new beverage called kykeon to drink instead. The fact that Demeter refuses to drink wine on the grounds that it would be against themis indicates that she is well aware of who Persephone's abductor is, that it is the Subterranean cover name of Dionysus. The critic of the mysteries, the severe philosopher Herakleitos once declared \"Hades is the same as Dionysos.\" The subterranean wine god was the ravisher, so how could Demeter accept something that was his gift to mankind\" [p. 40]</ref> votive marble images<ref>''Summary of Karl Ker\u00e9nyi:''\n\n\"The book later refers to Herakles initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries so that he may enter the Underworld.

Kore is shown with her mother Demeter and a snake twined around the Mystery basket, foreshadowing the secret, as making friends with snakes was Dionysian [p. 58].\nThe god of the Anthesteria was Dionysus, who celebrated his marriage in Athens amid flowers, the opening of wine jars, and the rising up of the souls of the dead [p. 149].\nThere are two reliefs in a marble votive relief of the fourth century BC. One depicts Kore crowning her mother Demeter, the deities at the second altar are Persephone and her husband Dionysus as the recumbent god has the features of the bearded Dionysus rather than of Plouton. In his right hand, he raises not a cornucopia, the symbol of wealth, but a wine vessel and in his left, he bears the goblet for the wine. Over their heads an inscription reads \"To the God and Goddess\" [pp. 151, 152].\nThe fragments of a gilded jar cover of the Kerch type show Dionysus, Demeter, little Ploutos, Kore, and a curly-haired boy clad in a long garment, one of the first son's of the Eleusinian king who was the first to be initiated.\nOn another vase, Dionysus sits on his omphalos with his thryrsos in his left hand, sitting opposite Demeter, looking at each other severely.

''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter''</ref> and epithets<ref>''Summary of Karl Ker\u00e9nyi:''\n\nKore and Thea are two different duplications of Persephone; Plouton and Theos are duplications of the subterranean Dionysus. The duplication of the mystery god as subterranean father and subterranean son, as Father Zagreus and the child Zagreus, husband and son of Persephone, has more to do with the mysteries of Dionysus than with the Eleusinian Mysteries. But a duplication of the chthonian, mystical Dionysus is provided even by his youthful aspect, which became distinguished and classical as the son of Semele from the son of Persephone.

The Byzantine Greek encyclopedia, ''[[Suda]]'' (c. tenth century), stated: <blockquote>Sabazios&nbsp;... is the same as Dionysos. He acquired this form of address from the rite pertaining to him; for the barbarians call the bacchic cry \"sabazein\". Hence some of the Greeks too follow suit and call the cry \"sabasmos\"; thereby Dionysos [becomes] Sabazios. They also used to call \"saboi\" those places that had been dedicated to him and his [[Bacchantes]]&nbsp;... Demosthenes [in the speech] \"On Behalf of Ktesiphon\" [mentions them]. Some say that Saboi is the term for those who are dedicated to Sabazios, that is to Dionysos, just as those [dedicated] to Bakkhos [are] Bakkhoi. They say that Sabazios and Dionysos are the same. Thus some also say that the Greeks call the Bakkhoi Saboi.<ref>Sudas, under \"Sabazios\", \"saboi\"; Sider, David. \"Notes on Two Epigrams of Philodemus\". ''The American Journal of Philology'', '''103'''.2 (Summer 1982:208\u2013213) pp. 209ff.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Strabo]], in the first century, linked Sabazios with Zagreus among Phrygian ministers and attendants of the sacred rites of Rhea and Dionysos.<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', 10.3.15.</ref> Strabo's Sicilian contemporary, [[Diodorus Siculus]], conflated Sabazios with the secret Dionysus, born of Zeus and Persephone,<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], 4.4.1.</ref> However, this connection is not supported by any surviving inscriptions, which are entirely to ''Zeus Sabazios''.<ref>E.N. Lane has taken pains to dismiss this widespread conflation: Lane, \"Towards a definition of the iconography of Sabazios\", ''Numen''  '''27''' (1980:9\u201333), and ''Corpus Cultis Jovis Sabazii:'', in ''\u00c9tudes Pr\u00e9liminaires aux Religions Orientales dans l'Empire Romain: Conclusions'' '''100'''.3  (Leiden, etc: Brill) 1989.</ref>\n\nSeveral ancient sources record an apparently widespread belief in the classical world that the god worshiped by the [[Judaism|Jewish]] people, [[Yahweh]], was identifiable as Dionysus or [[Liber]] via his identification with Sabazios. Tacitus, Lydus, Cornelius Labeo, and Plutarch all either made this association, or discussed it as an extant belief (though some, like Tacitus, specifically brought it up in order to reject it). According to Plutarch, one of the reasons for the identification is that Jews were reported to hail their god with the words \"Euoe\" and \"Sabi\", a cry typically associated with the worship of Sabazius. According to scholar Sean McDonough, it is possible that Plutarch's sources had confused the cry of \"Iao Sabaoth\" (typically used by Greek speakers in reference to Yahweh) with the Sabazian cry of \"Euoe Saboe\", originating the confusion and conflation of the two deities. The cry of \"Sabi\" could also have been conflated with the Jewish term \"sabbath\", adding to the evidence the ancients saw that Yahweh and Dionysus/Sabazius were the same deity. Further bolstering this connection would have been coins used by the [[Maccabees]] that included imagery linked to the worship of Dionysus such as grapes, vine leaves, and cups. However the belief that the Jewish god was identical with Dionysus/Sabazius was widespread enough that a coin dated to 55 BC depicting a kneeling king was labelled \"Bacchus Judaeus\" (''BACCHIVS IVDAEVS''), and in 139 BC praetor [[Cornelius Scipio Hispalus]] deported Jewish people for attempting to \"infect the Roman customs with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius\".<ref>McDonough 1999, pp. 88\u201390</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Roman - Sarcophagus Depicting the Birth of Dionysus - Walters 2333.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Birth of Dionysus, on a small sarcophagus that may have been made for a child ([[Walters Art Museum]])<ref>{{cite web|publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]|url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/16574|title= Sarcophagus Depicting the Birth of Dionysus}}</ref>]]\nVarious different accounts and traditions existed in the ancient world regarding the parentage, birth, and life of Dionysus on earth, complicated by his several rebirths. By the first century BC, some mythographers had attempted to harmonize the various accounts of Dionysus' birth into a single narrative involving not only multiple births, but two or three distinct manifestations of the god on earth throughout history in different lifetimes. The historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] said that according to \"some writers of myths\" there were two gods named Dionysus, an older one, who was the son of Zeus and Persephone,<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4A*.html#4 4.4.1].</ref> but that the \"younger one also inherited the deeds of the older, and so the men of later times, being unaware of the truth and being deceived because of the identity of their names thought there had been but one Dionysus.\"<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4A*.html#4 4.4.5].</ref> He also said that Dionysus \"was thought to have two forms...the ancient one having a long beard, because all men in early times wore long beards, the younger one being youthful and effeminate and young.\"<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4A*.html#5 4.5.2].</ref>\n\n[[File:Dionysus, marble bust Knossos, 2nd century AD, AMH, 145410.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Marble bust of youthful Dionysus.

According to Diodorus, Dionysus was originally the son of Zeus and [[Persephone]] (or alternately, Zeus and [[Demeter]]). This is the same horned Dionysus described by Hyginus and Nonnus in later accounts, and the Dionysus worshiped by the Orphics, who was dismembered by the Titans and then reborn. Nonnus calls this Dionysus [[Zagreus]], while Diodorus says he is also considered identical with [[Sabazius]].<ref name=diodiii/> However, unlike Hyginus and Nonnus, Diodorus does not provide a birth narrative for this incarnation of the god. It was this Dionysus who was said to have taught mortals how use use oxen to plow the fields, rather than doing so by hand. His worshipers were said to have honored him for this by depicting him with horns.<ref name=diodiii/>\n[[File:Mascherone di dioniso in bronzo, gi\u00e0 attacco di un manico in una situla o simile, 200-100 ac. ca.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Bronze mask depicting Dionysus bearded and horned, 200 BC \u2013 100 AD.

In it, he described how Zeus \"intended to make a new Dionysos grow up, a bullshaped copy of the older Dionysos\" who was the Egyptian god Osiris. (Dionysiaca 4)<ref>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 4. 268 ff (trans. Rouse)</ref> Zeus took the shape of a serpent (\"''drakon''\"), and \"ravished the maidenhood of unwedded Persephoneia.\" According to Nonnus, though Persephone was \"the consort of the blackrobed king of the underworld\", she remained a virgin, and had been hidden in a cave by her mother to avoid the many gods who were her suitors, because \"all that dwelt in Olympos were bewitched by this one girl, rivals in love for the marriageable maid.\" (Dionysiaca 5)<ref>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 5. 562 ff (trans. Rouse)</ref> After her union with Zeus, Perseophone's womb \"swelled with living fruit\", and she gave birth to a horned baby, named Zagreus. Zagreus, despite his infancy, was able to climb onto the throne of Zeus and brandish his lightning bolts, marking him a Zeus' heir. Hera saw this and alerted the Titans, who smeared their faces with chalk and ambushed the infant Zagreus \"while he contemplated his changeling countenance reflected in a mirror.\" They attacked him. However, according to Nonnus, \"where his limbs had been cut piecemeal by the Titan steel, the end of his life was the beginning of a new life as Dionysos.\" He began to change into many different forms in which he returned the attack, including Zeus, Kronos, a baby, and \"a mad youth with the flower of the first down marking his rounded chin with black.\" He then transformed into several animals to attack the assembled Titans, including a lion, a wild horse, a horned serpent, a tiger, and, finally, a bull. Hera intervened, killing the bull with a shout, and the Titans finally slaughtered him and cut him into pieces. Zeus attacked the Titans and had them imprisoned in [[Tartaros]]. This caused the mother of the Titans, [[Gaia]], to suffer, and her symptoms were seen across the whole world, resulting in fires and floods, and boiling seas. Zeus took pity on her, and in order to cool down the burning land, he caused great rains to [[Flood myth|flood the world]]. (Dionysiaca 6)<ref>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 6. 155 ff (trans.

As a result, the Orphics considered him the son of Persephone, and believed that he had been dismembered by the [[Titans (mythology)|Titans]] and then reborn. The myth of the dismemberment of Dionysus was alluded to as early as the fourth century BC by [[Plato]] in his ''[[Phaedo]]'', in which Socrates claims that the initiations of the Dionysian Mysteries are similar to those of the philosophic path. Late Neoplatonists such as [[Damascius]] explored the implications of this at length.<ref>Damascius, Commentary on the Phaedo, I, 1\u201313 and 165\u2013172, see in translation Westerink, The Greek Commentaries on Plato's Phaedo, vol. II, The Prometheus Trust, Westbury, 2009</ref> The dismemberment of Dionysus (the ''[[sparagmos]]'') is often considered to be the most important myth of Orphism.<ref>Nilsson, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1508326?seq=1 p. 202] calls it \"the cardinal myth of Orphism\"; Guthrie, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-C6wNyrxUO8C&pg=PA107 p. 107], describes the myth as \"the central point of Orphic story\", Linforth, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008294699;view=1up;seq=333 p. 307] says it is \"commonly regarded as essentially and peculiarly Orphic and the very core of the Orphic religion\", and Parker 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dsOEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA495 p. 495], writes that \"it has been seen as the Orphic 'arch-myth'.</ref>\n\nMany modern sources identify this \"Orphic Dionysus\" with the god [[Zagreus]], though this name does not seem to have been used by any of the ancient Orphics, who simply called him Dionysus.<ref>According to Gantz, p. 118, 'Orphic sources preserved seem not to use the name \"Zagreus\", and according to  West 1983, p. 153, the 'name was probably not used in the Orphic narrative'. Edmonds 1999, p. 37 n. 6 says: 'Lobeck 1892 seems to be responsible for the use of the name Zagreus for the Orphic Dionysos. As Linforth noticed, \"It is a curious thing that the name Zagreus does not appear in any Orphic poem or fragment, nor is it used by any author who refers to Orpheus\" (Linforth 1941:[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008294699;view=1up;seq=337 311]). In his reconstruction of the story, however, Lobeck made extensive use of the fifth-century epic of Nonnos, who does use the name Zagreus, and later scholars followed his cue. The association of Dionysos with Zagreus appears first explicitly in a fragment of Callimachus preserved in the Etymologicum Magnum (fr. 43.117 P), with a possible earlier precedent in the fragment from Euripides ''Cretans'' (fr. 472 Nauck). Earlier evidence, however, (e.g., ''Alkmaionis'' fr. 3 PEG; Aeschylus frr. 5, 228) suggests that Zagreus was often identified with other deities.'</ref> As pieced together from various ancient sources, the reconstructed story, usually given by modern scholars, goes as follows.<ref>West 1983, pp. 73\u201374, provides a detailed reconstruction with numerous cites to ancient sources, with a summary on p. 140.

The infant was taken to [[Mount Ida]], where, like the infant Zeus, he was guarded by the dancing [[Korybantes|Curetes]]. Zeus intended Dionysus to be his successor as ruler of the cosmos, but a jealous Hera incited the Titans to kill the child. It is said that he was mocked by the Titans who gave him a thyrsus (a fennel stalk) in place of his rightful scepter.<ref>Damascius, Commentary on the Phaedo, I, 170, see in translation Westerink, ''The Greek Commentaries on [[Plato]]'s Phaedo'', vol.

In this account, Dionysus is said to be the son of Zeus and Demeter, the goddess of agriculture.<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html#64 3.64.1]; also noted by Ker\u00e9ny (110 note 214).</ref> When the \"Sons of Gaia\" (i.e. the Titans) boiled Dionysus following his birth, Demeter gathered together his remains, allowing his rebirth. Diodorus noted the symbolism this myth held for its adherents: Dionysus, god of the vine, was born from the gods of the rain and the earth. He was torn apart and boiled by the sons of Gaia, or \"earth born\", symbolizing the harvesting and wine-making process. Just as the remains of the bare vines are returned to the earth to restore its fruitfulness, the remains of the young Dionysus were returned to Demeter allowing him to be born again.<ref name=diodiii>[[Diodorus Siculus]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html 3.62\u201374].</ref>\n\n===Second birth===\n[[File:Jupiter and Semele by Gustave Moreau.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Jupiter and Semele|Jupiter et S\u00e9m\u00e9l\u00e9]]''. Oil on canvas by [[Gustave Moreau]], 1895.]]\nThe birth narrative given by [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]] (c. 64 BC \u2013 17 AD) in ''Fabulae'' 167, agrees with the Orphic tradition that Liber (Dionysus) was originally the son of Jove (Zeus) and Proserpine (Persephone). Hyginus writes that Liber was torn apart by the Titans, so Jove took the fragments of his heart and put them into a drink which he gave to [[Semele]], the daughter of Harmonia and [[Cadmus]], king and founder of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]. This resulted in Semele becoming pregnant. [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] appeared to Semele in the form of her nurse, Beroe, and told her: \"Daughter, ask Jove to come to you as he comes to Juno, so you may know what pleasure it is to sleep with a god.\" When Semele requested that Jove do so, she was killed by a thunderbolt. Jove then took the infant Liber from her womb, and put him in the care of [[Nysus]]. Hyginus states that \"for this reason he is called Dionysus, and also the one with two mothers\" (''dim\u0113t\u014dr'').<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' CLXVII</ref>\n\nNonnus describes how, when life was rejuvenated after the flood, it was lacking in revelry in the absence of Dionysus. \"The [[Horae|Seasons]], those daughters of the lichtgang, still joyless, plaited garlands for the gods only of meadow-grass. For Wine was lacking. Without Bacchos to inspire the dance, its grace was only half complete and quite without profit; it charmed only the eyes of the company, when the circling dancer moved in twists and turns with a tumult of footsteps, having only nods for words, hand for mouth, fingers for voice.\" Zeus declared that he would send his son Dionysus to teach mortals how to grow grapes and make wine, to alleviate their toil, war, and suffering. After he became protector of humanity, Zeus promises, Dionysus would struggle on earth, but be received \"by the bright upper air to shine beside Zeus and to share the courses of the stars.\" (Dionysiaca 7).<ref>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 7. 14 ff (trans. Rouse)</ref>\n\n[[File:Sebastiano_Ricci_-_Dionysus_(1695).jpg|thumb|left|''\"Jove and Semele\"'' (c. 1695) by [[Sebastiano Ricci]].]]\nThe mortal princess Semele then had a dream, in which Zeus destroyed a fruit tree with a bolt of lightning, but did not harm the fruit. He sent a bird to bring him one of the fruits, and sewed it into his thigh, so that he would be both mother and father to the new Dionysus. She saw the bull-shaped figure of a man emerge from his thigh, and then came to the realization that she herself had been the tree. Her father Cadmus, fearful of the prophetic dream, instructed Semele to make sacrifices to Zeus. Zeus came to Semele in her bed, adorned with various symbols of Dionysus. He transformed into a snake, and \"Zeus made long wooing, and shouted \"Euoi!\" as if the winepress were near, as he begat his son who would love the cry.\" Immediately, Semele's bed and chambers were overgrown with vines and flowers, and the earth laughed. Zeus then spoke to Semele, revealing his true identity, and telling her to be happy: \"you bring forth a son who shall not die, and you I will call immortal. Happy woman! you have conceived a son who will make mortals forget their troubles, you shall bring forth joy for gods and men.\" (Dionysiaca 7).<ref>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 7. 139 ff (trans. Rouse)</ref>\n\nDuring her pregnancy, Semele rejoiced in the knowledge that her son would be divine. She dressed herself in garlands of flowers and wreathes of ivy, and would run barefoot to the meadows and forests to frolic whenever she heard music. Hera became envious, and feared that Zeus would replace her with Semele as queen of Olympus. She went to Semele in the guise of an old woman who had been Cadmus' wet nurse. She made Semele jealous of the attention Zeus' gave to Hera, compared with their own brief liaison, and provoked her to request Zeus to appear before her in his full godhood. Semele prayed to Zeus that he show himself. Zeus answered her prayers, but warned her than no other mortals had ever seen him as he held his lightning bolts. Semele reached out to touch them, and was burnt to ash. (Dionysiaca 8).<ref>Nonnus, Dionysiaca 8. (trans. Rouse)</ref> But the infant Dionysus survived, and Zeus rescued him from the flames, sewing him into his thigh. \"So the rounded thigh in labour became female, and the boy too soon born was brought forth, but not in a mother\u2019s way, having passed from a mother\u2019s womb to a father\u2019s.\" (Dionysiaca 9). At his birth, he had a pair of horns shaped like a crescent moon. The [[Horae|Seasons]] crowned him with ivy and flowers, and wrapped horned snakes around his own horns.<ref name=dion.9/>\n\nAn alternate birth narrative is given by Diodorus from the Egyptian tradition. In it, Dionysus is the son of [[Amun|Ammon]], who Diodorus regards both as the creator god and a quasi-historical king of [[Libya]]. Ammon had married the goddess [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], but he had an affair with [[Amaltheia]], who bore Dionysus. Ammon feared Rhea's wrath if she were to discover the child, so he took the infant Dionysus to [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]] (Dionysus' traditional childhood home). Ammon brought Dionysus into a cave where he was to be cared for by Nysa, a daughter of the hero [[Aristaeus]].<ref name=diodiii/> Dionysus grew famous due to his skill in the arts, his beauty, and his strength. It was said that he discovered the art of winemaking during his boyhood. His fame brought him to the attention of Rhea, who was furious with Ammon for his deception. She attempted to bring Dionysus under her own power but, unable to do so, she left Ammon and married [[Cronus]].<ref name=diodiii/>\n\n====Interpretation====\n[[File:Delos Museum Mosaik Dionysos 05.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic Greek]] [[mosaic]] depicting the god [[Dionysos]] as a winged [[daimon]] riding on a tiger, from [[Mosaics of Delos|the House of Dionysos]] at [[Delos]] (which [[History of Delos|was once controlled]] by [[History of Athens|Athens]]) in the [[South Aegean]] [[Administrative regions of Greece|region]] of [[Greece]], late second century BC, [[Archaeological Museum of Delos]]]]\nEven in antiquity, the account of Dionysus' birth to a mortal woman led some to argue that he had been a historical figure who became deified over time, a suggestion of [[Euhemerism]] (an explanation of mythic events having roots in mortal history) often applied to demi-gods. The fourth century Roman emperor and philosopher [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] encountered examples of this belief, and wrote arguments against it. In his letter ''To the Cynic Heracleios'', Julian wrote \"I have heard many people say that Dionysus was a mortal man because he was born of Semele, and that he became a god through his knowledge of [[theurgy]] and the Mysteries, and like our lord Heracles for his royal virtue was translated to Olympus by his father Zeus.\" However, to Julian, the myth of Dionysus's birth (and that of Heracles) stood as an allegory for a deeper spiritual truth. The birth of Dionysus, Julian argues, was \"no birth but a divine manifestation\" to Semele, who foresaw that a physical manifestation of the god Dionysus would soon appear. However, Semele was impatient for the god to come, and began revealing his mysteries too early; for her transgression, she was struck down by Zeus. When Zeus decided it was time to impose a new order on humanity, for it to \"pass from the nomadic to a more civilized mode of life\", he sent his son Dionysus from India as a god made visible, spreading his worship and giving the vine as a symbol of his manifestation among mortals. In Julian's interpretation, the Greeks \"called Semele the mother of Dionysus because of the prediction that she had made, but also because the god honored her as having been the first prophetess of his advent while it was yet to be.\" The allegorical myth of the birth of Dionysus, per Julian, was developed to express both the history of these events and encapsulate the truth of his birth outside the generative processes of the mortal world, but entering into it, though his true birth was directly from Zeus along into the [[Neoplatonism|intelligible realm]].<ref name=julian>Julian, trans. by Emily Wilmer Cave Wright.

Hermes gave Dionysus to the Lamides, or daughters of Lamos, who were river nymphs. But Hera drove the Lamides mad, and caused them to attack Dionysus, who was rescued by Hermes. Hermes next brought the infant to [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]] for fostering by her attendant Mystis, who taught him the rites of the mysteries (Dionysiaca 9). In Apollodorus' account, Hermes instructed Ino to raise Dionysus as a girl, in order to hide him from Hera's wrath.<ref>Apollodorus, The Library, with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes.

Young Dionysus was also said to have been one of the many famous pupils of the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]].

In [[Phrygia]] the goddess [[Cybele]], better known to the Greeks as Rhea, cured him and taught him her religious rites, and he set out on a progress through Asia teaching the people the cultivation of the vine. The most famous part of his wanderings is his expedition to [[India]], which is said to have lasted several years.

When he was aboard, they sailed not to Naxos but to Asia, intending to sell him as a slave. This time the god turned the mast and oars into snakes, and filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes so that the sailors went mad and, leaping into the sea, were turned into dolphins. In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]],'' Bacchus begins this story as a young child found by the pirates, but transforms to a divine adult when on board.\n\nMany of the Dionysus myths involve the god, whose birth was secret, defending his godhead against skeptics. Malcolm Bull notes that \"It is a measure of Bacchus's ambiguous position in classical mythology that he, unlike the other Olympians, had to use a boat to travel to and from the islands with which he is associated\".<ref>Bull, 245\u2013247, 247 quoted</ref> Paola Corrente notes that in many sources, the incident with the pirates happens towards the end of Dionysus' time among mortals.

To do so, he had to contend with the hell dog [[Cerberus]], which was restrained for him by [[Heracles]]. After retrieving Semele, Dionysus emerged with her from the unfathomable waters of a lagoon on the coast of the [[Argolid]] near the prehistoric site of [[Lerna]], according to the local tradition.<ref name=PausaniasII>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' book 2</ref> This mythic event was commemorated with a yearly nighttime festival, the details of which were held secret by the local religion.

Prosymnus died before Dionysus could honor his pledge, so to satisfy Prosymnus' shade, Dionysus fashioned a [[phallus]] from an olive branch and sat on it at Prosymnus' tomb.<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Protreptikos,'' II-30 3\u20135</ref> This story survives in full only in Christian sources, whose aim was to discredit pagan mythology, but it appears to have also served to explain the origin of secret objects used by the [[Dionysian Mysteries]].<ref>[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Gentes'' [https://archive.org/stream/thesevenbooksofa00arnouoft#page/n279/mode/2up 5.28 (pp. 252\u2013253)] {{Harv|Dalby|2005|pp=108\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nThis same myth of Dionysus' descent to the underworld is related by both [[Diodorus Siculus]] in his first century BC work ''Bibliotheca historica'', and Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]] in the third book of his first century AD work ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''. In the latter, Apollodorus tells how after having been hidden away from Hera's wrath, Dionysus traveled the world opposing those who denied his godhood, finally proving it when he transformed his pirate captors into dolphins. After this, the culmination of his life on earth was his descent to retrieve his mother from the underworld. He renamed his mother [[Semele|Thyone]], and ascended with her to heaven, where she became a goddess.<ref>Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' book 3</ref> In this variant of the myth, it is implied that Dionysus both must prove his godhood to mortals, then also legitimize his place on Olympus by proving his lineage and elevating his mother to divine status, before taking his place among the Olympic gods.<ref name=corrente2012/>\n\n===Secondary myths===\n[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|left|240px|''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' by [[Titian]], at the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in London.]]\n[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|left|240px|''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' (1822) by [[Antoine-Jean Gros]].]]\n\n====Midas' golden touch====\nDionysus discovered that his old school master and foster father, [[Silenus]], had gone missing. The old man had wandered away drunk, and was found by some peasants who carried him to their king [[Midas]] (alternatively, he passed out in Midas' rose garden). The king recognized him hospitably, feasting him for ten days and nights while Silenus entertained with stories and songs. On the eleventh day, Midas brought Silenus back to Dionysus. Dionysus offered the king his choice of reward.\n\nMidas asked that whatever he might touch would turn to gold. Dionysus consented, though was sorry that he had not made a better choice. Midas rejoiced in his new power, which he hastened to put to the test. He touched and turned to gold an oak twig and a stone, but his joy vanished when he found that his bread, meat, and wine also turned to gold. Later, when his daughter embraced him, she too turned to gold.\n\nThe horrified king strove to divest the [[Midas Touch]], and he prayed to Dionysus to save him from starvation. The god consented, telling Midas to wash in the river [[Pactolus]]. As he did so, the power passed into them, and the river sands turned gold: this [[etiological myth]] explained the gold sands of the Pactolus.\n\n====Other myths====\nWhen [[Hephaestus]] bound [[Hera]] to a magical chair, Dionysus got him drunk and brought him back to Olympus after he passed out.\n\nWhen [[Theseus]] abandoned [[Ariadne]] sleeping on Naxos, Dionysus found and married her. She bore him a son named Oenopion, but he committed suicide or was killed by [[Perseus]]. In some variants, he had her crown put into the heavens as the constellation Corona; in others, he descended into [[Hades]] to restore her to the gods on Olympus. Another account claims Dionysus ordered Theseus to abandon Ariadne on the island of Naxos, for Dionysus had seen her as Theseus carried her onto the ship and had decided to marry her.\n\nA third descent by Dionysus to Hades is invented by [[Aristophanes]] in his comedy ''[[The Frogs]]''. Dionysus, as patron of the Athenian dramatic festival, the ''Dionysia'', wants to bring back to life one of the great tragedians. After a [[poetry slam]], [[Aeschylus]] is chosen in preference to [[Euripides]].\n\n[[Psalacantha]], a nymph, failed to win the love of Dionysus in preference to Ariadne, and ended up being changed into a plant.\n\nCallirrhoe was a [[Calydon]]ian woman who scorned [[Coresus]], a priest of Dionysus, who threatened to afflict all the women of Calydon with insanity (see [[Maenad]]). The priest was ordered to sacrifice Callirhoe but he killed himself instead. Callirhoe threw herself into a well which was later named after her.\n\n==Lovers and offspring==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n[[Aphrodite]]\n:[[Charites]] (Graces){{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n:: [[Pasithea]]\n:: [[Euphrosyne (mythology)|Euphrosyne]]\n:: [[Thalia (Grace)|Thalia]]\n:[[Priapus]] (possibly)<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.31.2 9.31.2].</ref>\n\n[[Ariadne]]\n:Ceramus\n:[[Enyeus]]\n:[[Euanthes]]\n:[[Eurymedon (mythology)|Eurymedon]]\n:Latramys\n:[[Maron (mythology)|Maron]]\n:[[Oenopion]]\n:Phanus\n:[[Peparethus]]\n:[[Phlias]]\n:[[Staphylus (son of Dionysus)|Staphylus]]\n:Tauropolis\n:[[Thoas (Tauri king)|Thoas]]\n\n[[Aura (mythology)|Aura]]\n:[[Iacchus]]<ref>[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/n61/mode/2up 1.26&ndash;28 I pp. 4, 5], [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca03nonnuoft#page/442/mode/2up 48.245&ndash;247 III pp. 440&ndash;443], [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca03nonnuoft#page/484/mode/2up 48.848&ndash;968 III pp. 484&ndash;493].</ref>\n:Iacchus' twin brother<ref>Unnamed brother of Iacchus, killed by Aura instantly upon birth.</ref>\n\n[[Alexirrhoe]]\n:[[Carmanor (son of Dionysus)|Carmanor]]\n\n[[Alphesiboea]]\n:Medus\n\n[[Althaea (mythology)|Althaea]]\n:[[Deianira]]\n\n[[Araethyrea]]\n:[[Phlias]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n[[Chthonophyle]]\n:[[Phlias]]\n\n[[Carya (daughter of Dion)|Carya]]\n:''No known offspring''\n\n[[Chione (Greek myth)|Chione]]\n:[[Priapus]] (possibly)<ref>[[Scholia]] on [[Theocritus]], Idyll 1. 21.</ref>\n\n[[Circe]]\n:[[Comus]]\n\n[[Cronois]]\n:[[Charites]] (Graces)\n:: [[Pasithea]]\n:: [[Euphrosyne (mythology)|Euphrosyne]]\n:: [[Thalia (Grace)|Thalia]]\n\n[[Nicaea (mythology)|Nicaea]]\n:[[Telete]]\n\n[[Pallene (mythology)|Pallene]]\n:''No known offspring''\n\nPercote\n:[[Priapus]] (possibly)<ref>[[Hesychius of Alexandria]] s. v.

The god himself is drawn in a chariot, usually by exotic beasts such as lions or tigers, and is sometimes attended by a bearded, drunken [[Silenus]]. This procession is presumed to be the cult model for the followers of his [[Dionysian Mysteries]].

Peters suggests the original meaning as \"he who runs among the trees\", or that of a \"runner in the woods\". Janda (2010) accepts the etymology but proposes the more cosmological interpretation of \"he who impels the (world-)tree\". This interpretation explains how ''Nysa'' could have been re-interpreted from a meaning of \"tree\" to the name of a mountain: the [[axis mundi]] of [[Indo-European mythology]] is represented both as a [[world-tree]] and as a [[world-mountain]].<ref>see Janda (2010), 16\u201344 for a detailed account.</ref>\n\nDionysus is also closely associated with the transition between summer and autumn. In the Mediterranean summer, marked by the rising of the dog star [[Sirius]], the weather becomes extremely hot, but it is also a time when the promise of coming harvests grow. Late summer, when [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is at the center of the sky, was the time of the grape harvest in ancient Greece. Plato describes the gifts of this season as the fruit that is harvested as well as Dionysian joy. Pindar describes the \"pure light of high summer\" as closely associated with Dionysus and possibly even an embodiment of the god himself. An image of Dionysus' birth from Zeus' thigh call him \"the light of Zeus\" (''Dios phos'') and associate him with the light of Sirius.<ref name=Kerenyi/>\n\n===In classical art===\n[[File:Table support with a Dionysiac group (AD 170-180) (3470740119).jpg|thumb|left|Marble table support adorned by a group including [[Dionysos]], [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and a [[Satyr]]; Dionysos holds a [[rhyton]] (drinking vessel) in the shape of a panther; traces of [[Red hair|red]] and [[Blond|yellow colour]] are preserved on [[Hair color|the hair]] of the figures and the branches; from an [[Asia Minor]] workshop, 170\u2013180 AD, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]], Greece]]\n\nThe god, and still more often his followers, were commonly depicted in the painted [[pottery of Ancient Greece]], much of which made to hold wine.

The [[Furietti Centaurs]] and ''[[Sleeping Hermaphroditus]]'' reflect related subjects, which had by this time become drawn into the Dionysian orbit.<ref>Smith 1991, 127\u2013154</ref> The marble [[Dancer of Pergamon]] is an original, as is the bronze [[Dancing Satyr of Mazara del Vallo]], a recent recovery from the sea.\n\nThe Dionysian world by the Hellenistic period is a hedonistic but safe [[pastoral]] into which other semi-divine creatures of the countryside have been co-opted, such as [[centaur]]s, [[nymph]]s, and the gods [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and [[Hermaphroditus|Hermaphrodite]].<ref>Smith 1991, 127, 131, 133</ref> \"Nymph\" by this stage \"means simply an ideal female of the Dionysian outdoors, a non-wild bacchant\".<ref>Smith 1991, 130</ref> Hellenistic sculpture also includes for the first time large genre subjects of children and peasants, many of whom carry Dionysian attributes such as ivy wreaths, and \"most should be seen as part of his realm.

Its simplest level of meaning is that love needs food and wine to thrive. Artwork based on this saying was popular during the period 1550\u20131630, especially in [[Northern Mannerism]] in [[Prague]] and the [[Low Countries]], as well as by [[Rubens]]. Because of his association with the vine harvest, Bacchus became the god of autumn, and he and his followers were often shown in sets depicting the seasons.<ref>Malcolm Bull, ''The Mirror of the Gods, How Renaissance Artists Rediscovered the Pagan Gods'', Oxford UP, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0195219234}}</ref>\n\n===Modern literature and philosophy===\n[[File:Los borrachos o el triunfo de Baco 1629 Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|220px|''[[The Triumph of Bacchus]]'', [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], c. 1629]]\n[[File:Cornelis de Vos - El triunfo de Baco.jpg|thumb|220px|The triumph of [[Bacchus]] by [[Cornelis de Vos]].]]\n<!--this section has been worked into connected encyclopedic text: please do not add bulletted items of trivia-->\n\nDionysus has remained an inspiration to artists, philosophers and writers into the [[modern era]]. In ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872), the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] proposed that a tension between [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] aesthetic principles underlay the development of [[Greek tragedy]]; Dionysus represented what was unrestrained chaotic and irrational, while Apollo represented the rational and ordered. This concept of a rivalry or opposition between Dionysus and Apollo has been characterized as a \"modern myth\", as it is the invention of modern thinkers like Nietzsche and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], and is not found in classical sources. However, the acceptance and popularity of this theme in Western culture has been so great, that its undercurrent has influenced the conclusions of classical scholarship.<ref>Isler-Ker\u00e9nyi, C., & Watson, W.

Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76w9x.13</ref>\n\nNietzsche also claimed that the oldest forms of Greek Tragedy were entirely based upon the suffering Dionysus. In Nietzsche's 1886 work ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', and later ''[[The Twilight of the Idols]]'', ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'' and ''[[Ecce Homo]]'', Dionysus is conceived as the embodiment of the unrestrained [[will to power]].

The two stories take place in very different historical and geographic contexts.

The discrepancies between the two stories, including their resolutions, have led many scholars to regard the Dionysus story as radically different from the one about Jesus, except for the parallel of the arrest, which is a detail that appears in many biographies as well.<ref>Dalby, Andrew (2005).

Within Orphism, it was believed that consuming the meat and wine was symbolic of the Titans eating the flesh (meat) and blood (wine) of Dionysus and that, by participating in the omophagia, Dionysus' followers could achieve communion with the god. Powell, in particular, argues that precursors to the Catholic notion of [[transubstantiation]] can be found in Dionysian religion.<ref name=Powell/>\n\n===Other parallels===\nE. Kessler has argued that the Dionysian cult developed into strict [[monotheism]] by the fouth century AD; together with [[Mithraism]] and other sects, the cult formed an instance of \"pagan monotheism\" in direct competition with [[Early Christianity]] during [[Late Antiquity]].<ref>E. Kessler, ''Dionysian Monotheism in Nea Paphos, Cyprus''. Symposium on ''Pagan Monotheism in the Roman Empire'', Exeter, 17\u201320 July 2006 [http://www.huss.ex.ac.uk/classics/conferences/pagan_monotheism/abstracts.html Abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032154/http://www.huss.ex.ac.uk/classics/conferences/pagan_monotheism/abstracts.html |date=2008-04-21 }})</ref> Scholars from the sixteenth century onwards, especially [[Gerard Vossius]], also discussed the parallels between the biographies of Dionysus/Bacchus and [[Moses]] (Vossius named his sons [[Dionysius Vossius|Dionysius]] and [[Isaac Vossius|Isaac]]). Such comparisons surface in details of paintings by Poussin.<ref>Bull, 240\u2013241</ref>\n\n[[Tacitus]], [[John the Lydian]], and [[Cornelius Labeo]] all identify Yahweh with the Greek god Dionysus.{{sfn|McDonough|1999|page=88}} Jews themselves frequently used symbols that were also associated with Dionysus such as [[kylix]]es, [[amphora]]e, leaves of ivy, and clusters of grapes.{{sfn|Smith|Cohen|1996a|page=233}} In his ''[[Moralia|Quaestiones Convivales]]'', the Greek writer [[Plutarch of Chaeronea]] writes that the Jews hail their god with cries of \"Euoi\" and \"Sabi\", phrases associated with the worship of Dionysus.<ref>[[Plutarch]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0312%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D6 ''Quaestiones Convivales'', Question VI]</ref>{{sfn|McDonough|1999|page=89}}{{sfn|Smith|Cohen|1996a|pages=232\u2013233}} According to Sean M.

In particular, he argues that the account of Christian origins in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] was heavily influenced by [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]''.<ref name=\"moles\"/> Moles also suggests that [[Paul the Apostle]] may have partially based his account of the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]]{{bibleref2c|1 Cor|11:23\u201326}} on the ritual meals performed by members of the Dionysian cult.<ref name=\"moles\"/>{{rp|96}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Dionysus Sarcophagus.jpg|Roman marble sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysos and the Seasons (circa 260\u2013270 AD)\nFile:Roman - Sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysus - Walters 2331 (2).jpg|Triumph of Dionysus\nFile:Exekias Dionysos Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2044 n2.jpg|The [[Dionysus Cup]], a sixth-century BC [[kylix]] with Dionysus sailing with the pirates he transformed to dolphins\nFile:Dionysos on a cheetah, Pella, Greece.jpg|Dionysos riding a [[leopard]], [[Kingdom of Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[mosaic]] from [[Pella]], Greece (fourth century BC)\nFile:Dionysos Sardanapalus.jpg|Statue of [[Dionysus Sardanapalus|Dionysus (Sardanapalus)]] ([[National Roman Museum|Museo Palazzo Massimo Alle Terme]], Rome)\nFile:Bronze Head of Dionysos.JPG|Bronze head of Dionysus (50 BC \u2013 50 AD) in the [[British Museum]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=460422&partId=1&people=130287&peoA=130287-3-17&page=1|title=British Museum \u2013 statue|publisher=}}</ref>\nFile:Remich Statue of Dionysus.JPG|Statue of Dionysus in [[Remich]] [[Luxembourg]]\nFile:Fane Table.jpg|A Bacchus themed table - the top was made in Florence (c. 1736) and the gilded wood base in Britain or Ireland (circa 1736\u20131740).\nFile:Bacchus (Giovanni Francesco Romanelli) - Nationalmuseum - 17103.tif|''Bacchus'' \u2013 [[Giovanni Francesco Romanelli]] (seventeenth century)\nFile:Dion\u00fcszosz amf\u00f3ra.jpg|Dionysian amphora\nFile:Dion\u00fcszosz kancs\u00f3.jpg|Dionysian jug\nFile:3326 - Athens - Sto\u00e0 of Attalus Museum - Head of Dyonisos - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 9 2009.jpg|[[Terracotta]] vase in the shape of Dionysus' head (circa 410 BC) \u2013 on display in the [[Ancient Agora Museum]] in [[Athens]], housed in the [[Stoa of Attalus]]\nFile:Amphora with cult mask of Dionysus, by the Antimenes Painter, arounbd 520 BC, Altes Museum Berlin (13718436013).jpg|Amphora with cult mask of Dionysus, by the Antimenes Painter, arounbd 520 BC, [[Altes Museum]]\nFile:Marble head of Dionysus, from the Gymnasium of Salamis, 2nd century AD, Cyprus Museum, Nicosia, Cyprus (22309811890).jpg|Marble head of Dionysus, from the Gymnasium of Salamis, second century AD, [[Cyprus Museum]], [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]]\nFile:Dionysos - Landesmuseum W\u00fcrttemberg.jpg|Cult mask of Dionysus from [[Boeotia]], fourth century BC\nFile:Marble_statuette_of_Dionysos_MET_DP367957.jpg|Marble statuette of Dionysos, early third century B.C, [[Metropolitan Museum]]\n\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Greece|Myths|Religion}}\n* [[Alpos]]\n* [[Apollonian and Dionysian]]\n* [[Ascolia]]\n* [[Bacchanalia]]\n* [[Dionysian Mysteries]]\n* [[Orgia]]\n* [[Theatre of Dionysus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* [[Aristides]], ''Aristides ex recensione Guilielmi Dindorfii, Volume 3'', [[Wilhelm Dindorf]], Weidmann, G.

He was the 8th child to his parents and had 10 siblings. He was adopted by Chigappi Aachi for a sum of INR 7000 at an early age, who brought him up and was responsible for his early stages of school education. He completed his schooling till the 8th standard in Sirukudalpatti and Amaravathipudhur. He worked for a private company in [[Tiruvottiyur]] before taking up an editorial post in a Tamil Magazine where for the first time he took up the pseudonym Kannadasan.\n\nHis friendship with [[M. S. Viswanathan|MSV]] was legendary and the combination of these two geniuses created some of the most important songs of Tamil Cinema.\n\n==Religious views -Muthiah  was a keen follower of the Dravidian atheistic movement. He had great love of Tamil language and its culture, and excelled in [[Tamil literature]], both prose and poetry. He read the [[Thiruppavai]] of [[Andal]], and was amazed at its mystic poetry, which was to have a deep and lasting impact on him. After a lot of introspection, he decided to go back to [[Hinduism|Sanatana Dharma]]. He renamed himself as Kannadasan, meaning the servant of Lord [[Sri Krishna]] (In Tamil Kannan means Krishna and in Sanskrit, ''dasa'' means ''servant''), as he had become a [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] [[Hindu]]. He Also built a Temple for Lord Krishna which is located on Thankichalam Chetty road in T.Nagar, just a couple of hundred meters from his home. He dug deep into understanding [[Hinduism|Sanatana Dharma]], and wrote his series of books on Sanatana Dharma titled ''Arthamulla Indhu Matham''. He was born in the village of Sirukoodalpatti, which is near [[Karaikudi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nattukottaichettiar.blogspot.in/|title=nattukottai chettiar|website=Nattukottaichettiar.blogspot.in|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nagarathar Heritage|title=Kannadasan Biography {{!}} Kaviarasu {{!}} Sirukoodalpatti|date=2017-04-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q11nirUmlwA|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2017-08-28}}</ref>\n\n==Songwriting==\nKannadasan's greatest contribution to Tamil culture is his songwriting. Before Kannadasan, many lyricists like [[Papanasam Sivan]], Kambadasan, Vindhan, [[A. Maruthakasi]], and [[Ku. Ma. Balasubramaniam]] were sought after in the Tamil music industry, but after the advent of Kannadasan, the scene changed. He quickly became the most sought after lyricist in the industry and remained so until his death. Kannadasan was so popular that few songs written by other contemporary poets were considered to be written by Kannadhasan } Though, after his death, film lyrics have come a long way, many people still consider Kannadasan to be the best songwriter.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} He is considered to be the greatest modern Tamil poet after [[Subramanya Bharathi]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nHe was the producer of the historic Tamil film ''Sivagangai Seemai'' portraying the pioneers of the Indian freedom struggle \"Marudhu Pandaiars\".

He was the 8th child to his parents and had 10 siblings. He was adopted by Chigappi Aachi for a sum of INR 7000 at an early age, who brought him up and was responsible for his early stages of school education. He completed his schooling till the 8th standard in Sirukudalpatti and Amaravathipudhur. He worked for a private company in [[Tiruvottiyur]] before taking up an editorial post in a Tamil Magazine where for the first time he took up the pseudonym Kannadasan.\n\nHis friendship with [[M. S. Viswanathan|MSV]] was legendary and the combination of these two geniuses created some of the most important songs of Tamil Cinema.\n\n==Religious views -Muthiah  was a keen follower of the Dravidian atheistic movement. He had great love of Tamil language and its culture, and excelled in [[Tamil literature]], both prose and poetry. He read the [[Thiruppavai]] of [[Andal]], and was amazed at its mystic poetry, which was to have a deep and lasting impact on him. After a lot of introspection, he decided to go back to [[Hinduism|Sanatana Dharma]]. He renamed himself as Kannadasan, meaning the servant of Lord [[Sri Krishna]] (In Tamil Kannan means Krishna and in Sanskrit, ''dasa'' means ''servant''), as he had become a [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] [[Hindu]]. He Also built a Temple for Lord Krishna which is located on Thankichalam Chetty road in T.Nagar, just a couple of hundred meters from his home. He dug deep into understanding [[Hinduism|Sanatana Dharma]], and wrote his series of books on Sanatana Dharma titled ''Arthamulla Indhu Matham''. He was born in the village of Sirukoodalpatti, which is near [[Karaikudi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nattukottaichettiar.blogspot.in/|title=nattukottai chettiar|website=Nattukottaichettiar.blogspot.in|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nagarathar Heritage|title=Kannadasan Biography {{!}} Kaviarasu {{!}} Sirukoodalpatti|date=2017-04-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q11nirUmlwA|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2017-08-28}}</ref>\n\n==Songwriting==\nKannadasan's greatest contribution to Tamil culture is his songwriting. Before Kannadasan, many lyricists like [[Papanasam Sivan]], Kambadasan, Vindhan, [[A. Maruthakasi]], and [[Ku. Ma. Balasubramaniam]] were sought after in the Tamil music industry, but after the advent of Kannadasan, the scene changed. He quickly became the most sought after lyricist in the industry and remained so until his death. Kannadasan was so popular that few songs written by other contemporary poets were considered to be written by Kannadhasan } Though, after his death, film lyrics have come a long way, many people still consider Kannadasan to be the best songwriter.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} He is considered to be the greatest modern Tamil poet after [[Subramanya Bharathi]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nHe was the producer of the historic Tamil film ''Sivagangai Seemai'' portraying the pioneers of the Indian freedom struggle \"Marudhu Pandaiars\".
