{"title_page": "KOI8-U", "text_new": "{{infobox character encoding\n|name=KOI8-U\n|lang=[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]\n|classification=8-bit [[KOI character encodings|KOI]], [[extended ASCII]]\n|basedon=[[KOI8-R]]\n|extends=[[KOI8-B]]\n|otherrelated=[[KOI8-RU]], [[KOI8-F]]\n}}\n'''KOI8-U''' (RFC 2319) is an 8-bit [[character encoding]], designed to cover [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], which uses a [[Cyrillic]] alphabet. It is based on [[KOI8-R]], which covers [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], but replaces eight box drawing characters with four Ukrainian letters [[Ghe with upturn|\u0490]], [[Ukrainian Ye|\u0404]], [[Soft-dotted i (Cyrillic)|\u0406]], and [[Yi (Cyrillic)|\u0407]] in both upper case and lower case.\n\n[[KOI8-RU]] is closely related, but adds \u040e for [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]. In both, the letter allocations match those in [[KOI8-E]], except for \u0490 which is added to [[KOI8-F]].\n\nIn [[Microsoft Windows]], KOI8-U is assigned the code page number 21866. In [[IBM]], KOI8-U is assigned code page 1168.<ref name=\"IBM\"/><ref name=\"IBM_1168_2\"/>\n\nKOI8 remains much more commonly used than [[ISO 8859-5]], which never really caught on.  Another common Cyrillic character encoding is [[Windows-1251]]. In the future, both may eventually give way to [[Unicode]].\n\nKOI8 stands for ''Kod Obmena Informatsiey, 8 bit'' ({{lang-ru|\u041a\u043e\u0434 \u041e\u0431\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u0439, 8 \u0431\u0438\u0442}}) which means \"Code for Information Exchange, 8 bit\".\n\nThe KOI8 character sets have the property that the Russian Cyrillic letters are in pseudo-Roman order rather than the natural Cyrillic alphabetical order as in ISO 8859-5.  Although this may seem unnatural, it has the useful property that if the eighth bit is stripped, the text can still be read (or at least deciphered) in case-reversed transliteration on an ordinary ASCII terminal.  For instance, \"\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0422\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\" in KOI8-U becomes ''rUSSKIJ tEKST'' (\"Russian Text\") if the 8th bit is stripped.\n\n==Character set==\nThe

It is based on [[KOI8-R]], which covers [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], but replaces eight box drawing characters with four Ukrainian letters [[Ghe with upturn|\u0490]], [[Ukrainian Ye|\u0404]], [[Soft-dotted i (Cyrillic)|\u0406]], and [[Yi (Cyrillic)|\u0407]] in both upper case and lower case.\n\n[[KOI8-RU]] is closely related, but adds \u040e for [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]. In both, the letter allocations match those in [[KOI8-E]], except for \u0490 which is added to [[KOI8-F]].\n\nIn [[Microsoft Windows]], KOI8-U is assigned the code page number 21866. In [[IBM]], KOI8-U is assigned code page 1168.<ref name=\"IBM\"/><ref name=\"IBM_1168_2\"/>\n\nKOI8 remains much more commonly used than [[ISO 8859-5]], which never really caught on.  Another common Cyrillic character encoding is [[Windows-1251]]. In the future, both may eventually give way to [[Unicode]].\n\nKOI8 stands for ''Kod Obmena Informatsiey, 8 bit'' ({{lang-ru|\u041a\u043e\u0434 \u041e\u0431\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u0439, 8 \u0431\u0438\u0442}}) which means \"Code for Information Exchange, 8 bit\".\n\nThe KOI8 character sets have the property that the Russian Cyrillic letters are in pseudo-Roman order rather than the natural Cyrillic alphabetical order as in ISO 8859-5.  Although this may seem unnatural, it has the useful property that if the eighth bit is stripped, the text can still be read (or at least deciphered) in case-reversed transliteration on an ordinary ASCII terminal.  For instance, \"\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0422\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\" in KOI8-U becomes ''rUSSKIJ tEKST'' (\"Russian Text\") if the 8th bit is stripped.\n\n==Character set==\nThe

in Russian.\n\nAlthough RFC 2319 says that character 0x95 should be U+2219 (\u2219), it may also be U+2022 (\u2022) to match the bullet character in [[Windows-1251]].\n\nSome references have a typo

The Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs reports to the [[Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs]].\n\nWhen the Department of State originally established the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs on September 18, 1969, the bureau had replaced a special component for politico-military affairs that had served under the Deputy [[Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs]] since 1960.

Later, the director became appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]], subject to the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate|Senate]], and the title of the head of the Bureau was changed to Assistant Secretary on April 14, 1986.<ref name=\"a\">{{cite web | title=Assistant Secretaries of State for Politico-Military Affairs | url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/po/12149.htm | accessdate= September 22, 2007  <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\n==List of Directors of the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, 1969\u20131985==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Assumed Office\n!Left Office\n![[President of the United States|President]] served under\n|-\n|[[Ronald I.

The Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs reports to the [[Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs]].\n\nWhen the Department of State originally established the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs on September 18, 1969, the bureau had replaced a special component for politico-military affairs that had served under the Deputy [[Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs]] since 1960. The head of the Bureau had the title of '''Director of the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs''', and was designated by the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], but still held rank equivalent to [[Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary]]. Later, the director became appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]], subject to the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate|Senate]], and the title of the head of the Bureau was changed to Assistant Secretary on April 14, 1986.<ref name=\"a\">{{cite web | title=Assistant Secretaries of State for Politico-Military Affairs | url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/po/12149.htm | accessdate= September 22, 2007  <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\n==List of Directors of the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, 1969\u20131985==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Assumed Office\n!Left Office\n![[President of the United States|President]] served under\n|-\n|[[Ronald I.

{"title_page": "Order of Nine Angles", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n[[File:Ona.svg|thumb|right|One of the main symbols of the ONA<ref name=\"lapisphilosophicus\"/>]]\n<!--Basic introduction-->\n'''The Order of Nine Angles''' ('''ONA'''; '''O9A''') is a [[Satanism|Satanic]] and [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|Left-Hand Path]] [[occultism|occult]] group based in the United Kingdom, but with associated groups in various other parts of the world. Claiming to have been established in the 1960s, it rose to public recognition in the early 1980s, attracting attention for its [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] ideologies and activism. Describing its approach as \"[[Theistic Satanism|Traditional Satanism]]\", it has been identified by academic researchers as also exhibiting [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] and [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] elements in its beliefs.\n\n<!--History of the ONA-->\nAccording to the Order's own account, it was established in the [[Welsh Marches]] of Western England during the late 1960s by a woman who had previously been involved in a secretive pre-Christian sect surviving in the region. This account also states that in 1973 a man named \"Anton Long\" was initiated into the group, subsequently becoming its Grand Master. Several academic commentators to have studied the ONA express the view that the name \"Anton Long\" is probably the pseudonym of the British neo-Nazi activist [[David Myatt]], although Myatt has denied that this is the case. From the late 1970s onward, Long authored a number of books and articles propagating the Order's ideas, and in 1988 it began production of its own journal, ''Fenrir''. Through these ventures it established links with other neo-Nazi Satanist groups around the world, furthering its cause through embracing the [[Internet]] in the 2000s.\n\n<!--Beliefs-->\nThe ONA promotes the idea that human history can be divided into a series of Aeons, each of which contain a corresponding human civilization. It expresses the view that the current Aeonic civilization is that of the [[Western culture|Western]], but claims that the evolution of this society is threatened by the \"Magian/Nazarene\u201d influence of [[Judeo-Christian]] religion, which the Order seeks to combat in order to establish a militaristic new social order, termed the \"Imperium\". According to Order teachings, this is necessary in order for a Galactic civilization to form, in which \"[[Aryan race|Aryan]]\" society will colonise the [[Milky Way]]. It advocates a spiritual path in which the practitioner is required to break societal taboos by isolating themselves from society, committing crimes, embracing political extremism and violence, and carrying out an act of [[human sacrifice]]. ONA members practice [[magic (paranormal)|magick]], believing that they are able to do so through channeling [[Energy (esotericism)|energies]] into our own \"causal\" realm from an \"acausal\" realm where the laws of physics do not apply, with such magical actions designed to aid in the ultimate establishment of the Imperium.\n\n<!--Structure and organisation-->\nThe ONA lacks any central authority or structure, instead operating as a broad network of associates &ndash; termed the \"kollective\" &ndash; who are inspired by the texts originally authored by Long and other members of the \"Inner ONA\". The group comprises largely of clandestine cells, termed \"nexions.\" With the first nexion based in [[Shropshire]], Western England, the majority of groups have been established in the British Isles and Germany, although others have been formed elsewhere in Europe, Russia, South Africa, Australia, and North America. Some academic estimates suggest that the number of individuals broadly associated with the Order falls in the low thousands. Various killings and [[terrorism|terroristic]] activities have been perpetrated by far-right activists influenced by the ONA's teachings, with various British politicians and activists calling for the ONA to be proscribed as a terrorist group. It has been described as one of the most extreme and dangerous Satanist groups in the world.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\n[[File:Shropshire UK locator map 2010.svg|thumb|right|The ONA's first cell, \"Nexion Zero\", was established in Shropshire (pictured).{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}}]]\n\nAcademics have found it difficult to ascertain \"exact and verifiable information\" about the ONA's origins given the secrecy with which the group shields itself.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=255}} As with many other occult organisations, the Order shrouds its history in \"mystery and legend\", creating a \"mythical narrative\" for its origins and development.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=255}} The ONA claims to be the descendant of pre-Christian [[paganism|pagan]] traditions which survived the [[Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianisation of Britain]] and which were passed down from the Middle Ages onward in small groups or \"temples\" based in the [[Welsh Marches]] &ndash; a border area between England and Wales &ndash; which were each led by a Grand Master or Grand Mistress.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=236|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=218}} According to the Order, in the late 1960s a Grand Mistress of one such group united three of these temples &ndash; Camlad, the Temple of the Sun, and The Noctulians &ndash; to form the ONA,{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}} before welcoming outsiders into the tradition.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=236|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=391}}\n\nAccording to the Order's account, one of those whom the Grand Mistress initiated into the group was \"Anton Long\", an individual who described himself as a British citizen who had spent much of his youth visiting Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=86}} Long claimed that prior to his involvement in the ONA he had been interested in occultism for several years, having contacted a [[coven]] based in [[The Fens|Fenland]] in 1968, before moving to London and joining groups that practiced [[ceremonial magic]] in the style of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and [[Aleister Crowley]].{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=255}} He also claimed a brief involvement in a Satanic group based in [[Manchester]], the [[Orthodox Temple of the Prince]] run by Ray Bogart, during which time he encountered the ONA Grand Mistress.{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1p=86|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3p=357}} According to the Order's account, Long joined the ONA in 1973 &ndash; the first to have done so in five years &ndash; and became the Grand Mistress' heir.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=217|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}} He later recalled that at that time the group held rituals at [[henges]] and [[Stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany|stone circles]] around the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=255}}\n\nThis account further states that when the Order's Grand Mistress migrated to Australia, Long took over as the group's new Grand Master.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}} The group claimed that Long \"implemented the next stage of Sinister Strategy &ndash; to make the teachings known on a large scale\".{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=256}} From the late 1970s onward, Long encouraged the establishment of new ONA groups, which were known as \"temples\",{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|pp=221&ndash;222}} and from 1976 onward he authored an array of texts for the tradition, codifying and extending its teachings, mythos, and structure.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256|3a1=Monette|3y=2013|3p=87}} These texts are typically written in English, although they include passages of [[Classical Greek]] as well as terms from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]],{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=87}} reflecting Long's fluency in such languages.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=86}} After examining these texts, the historian [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] stated that in them, Long \"evokes a world of witches, outlaw peasant sorcerers, orgies and blood sacrifices at lonely cottages in the woods and valleys of this area [Shropshire and Herefordshire] where he has lived since the early 1980s\".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=220}}\n\n[[File:Ibnmyatt.png|thumb|left|David Myatt (pictured 1998) is often cited as the central ideologue in the ONA.]]\n\nThe real identity of \"Anton Long\" remains a mystery to both members of the Order and to academics who have studied it.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=85}} However, in a 1998 issue of the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] magazine ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'', it was claimed that \"Anton Long\" was a pseudonym of [[David Myatt]], a prominent figure in the British neo-Nazi movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Senholt|1y=2013|1p=256|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=357}} Born in the early 1950s, Myatt had been involved in various neo-Nazi groups, initially serving as a bodyguard for [[Colin Jordan]] of the [[British Movement]] before joining the [[Combat 18]] militia and becoming a founding member and leader of the [[National Socialist Movement (United Kingdom)|National Socialist Movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1pp=217, 222|2a1=Ryan|2y=2003|2p=53|3a1=Senholt|3y=2013|3pp=263&ndash;264}} His text on ''A Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution'', in which he advocated violent militancy in aid of the neo-Nazi cause, was cited as an influence on the nail bomber [[David Copeland]].{{sfnm|1a1=Weitzmann|1y=2010|1p=16|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2pp=263&ndash;264}} In 1998 Myatt converted to [[Islam]] and remained a practicing Muslim for eight years, in which time he encouraged violent [[jihad]] against [[Zionism]] and Israel's Western allies.{{sfnm|1a1=Weitzmann|1y=2010|1pp=16&ndash;17|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2pp=265&ndash;267|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3p=358}} In 2010, he announced that he had renounced Islam and was practicing an esoteric tradition that he termed the \"Numinous Way\".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=358}}\n\nGoodrick-Clarke supported the idea that Myatt was Long,{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=216|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=357}} with the [[religious studies]] scholar Jacob C. Senholt adding that \"the role of David Myatt [is] paramount to the whole creation and existence of the ONA\".{{sfn|Senholt|2009|p=16}} Senholt presented additional evidence that he believed confirmed Myatt's identity as Long,{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=268}} writing that Myatt's embrace of neo-Nazism and radical [[Islamism]] represented \"insight roles\" which Myatt had adopted as part of the ONA's \"sinister strategy\" to undermine Western society,{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=267}} a view endorsed by scholar of Satanism Per Faxneld.{{sfn|Faxneld|2013a|p=207}} In 2015, an ONA member known as R. Parker argued in favour of the idea that Myatt was Long.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://omega9alpha.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/myatt-mage-v9d.pdf |accessdate=16 October 2015 |title=A Modern Mage |website=O9A |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cKRCfXiA?url=https://omega9alpha.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/myatt-mage-v9d.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> As a result of Page's publication, the sociologist of religion [[Massimo Introvigne]] stated that the ONA has \"more or less acknowledged\" that Myatt and Long are the same person, {{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=358}} which claim about Myatt the ONA has disputed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://omega9alpha.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/the-o9a-and-academia-v3.pdf |accessdate=2 June 2017 |title=Academia, David Myatt, and the Order of Nine Angles |website=O9A}}</ref>\n\nMyatt himself has repeatedly denied allegations that he has any involvement with the ONA,{{sfnm|1a1=Ryan|1y=2003|1p=53|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=267}} and that he has used the pseudonym \"Anton Long\",{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=111}} furthermore challenging the arguments used to connect him with Long by claiming that they are based on insufficient evidence.<ref name=Myatt-honor>{{cite web |url=http://www.davidmyatt.ws/myatt-a-matter-of-honour.html |accessdate=2012-10-10 |date=November 2012 |title=A Matter of Honour |website=David Myatt |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6biSydvsn?url=http://www.davidmyatt.ws/myatt-a-matter-of-honour.html |archivedate=2015-09-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Religious studies scholar George Sieg expressed concern with this association, stating that he found it to be \"implausible and untenable based on the extent of variance in writing style, personality, and tone\" between Myatt and Long.{{sfn|Sieg|2013|p=257}} [[Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|Jeffrey Kaplan]], an academic specialist in the far right, has also suggested that Myatt and Long are separate people,{{sfn|Kaplan|1998|p=115}} while the religious studies scholar Connell R. Monette posited the possibility that \"Anton Long\" was not a singular individual but rather a pseudonym used by several different people.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=92}}\n\n===Public emergence===\n\nThe ONA arose to public attention in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=293}} During the 1980s and 1990s it spread its message through articles in various magazines,{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=256}} such as Stephen Sennitt's ''Nox'',<ref>''The Infernal Texts: Nox & Liber Koth''. Falcon Publications, 1997. (Third edition, The Original Falcon Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-935150-73-2}})</ref> as well as through the publication of such volumes as ''The Black Book of Satan'',<ref name=blackbook>''The Black Book of Satan''. 1984, Thormynd Press, {{ISBN|0-946646-04-X}}.

its resulting quietness led some occultists to erroneously speculate that the ONA had become defunct.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=107}}\nIn 2000, the ONA established a presence on the Internet, using it as a medium to communicate with others and to distribute its writings.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=256}}\nIn 2008, the ONA announced that it was entering the third phase in its history, in which it would once again focus heavily on promotion, utilising such [[social media]] as online blogs, forums, [[Facebook]], and [[YouTube]] to spread its message.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=107}} In 2011, the \"Old Guard\", a group of longstanding members of the Order, stated that they would withdraw from active, public work with the group.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=93}} In March 2012, Long announced that he would be withdrawing from public activity, although he appears to have remained active in the Order.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=87}}\n\n==Beliefs and structure==\n\nThe ONA describes its beliefs as belonging to \"a sinisterly-numinous mystic tradition\", adding that \"it is not now and never was either strictly satanist or strictly Left Hand Path, but uses \"satanism\" and the LHP as \"causal forms\";

When in the past we and others like us have said things that others interpret as being against the [Temple of Set] or La Vey, we were simply assuming the role of Adversary \u2013 challenging what seemed to be becoming accepted dogma.\"{{sfn|Long|1992a||p=7}}\n\nAlthough conceiving of itself as having pre-Christian origins and describing Satanism as \"militant paganism\", the ONA does not advocate the re-establishment of pre-Christian belief systems, with one ONA tract stating that \"all past gods of the various Western Traditions are rendered obsolete by the forces which Satanism alone is unleashing\".{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=293}} However, Goodrick-Clarke noted that the group's \"ideas and rituals\" draw upon \"a native tradition\", with references to the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon concept of ''[[wyrd]]'', an emphasis on ceremonies performed at equinoxes, and the construction of incense using indigenous trees, thus suggesting the idea of \"rootedness in English nature\".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}} Practitioners undergo \"black pilgrimages\" to prehistoric ceremonial sites in the area around Shropshire and Herefordshire in the [[English Midlands]].{{Sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=220}}\nFurthermore, Monette writes that \"a critical examination of the ONA's key texts suggests that the satanic overtones could be cosmetic, and that its core mythos and cosmology are genuinely hermetic, with pagan influences.\"{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=87}}\n\n===Aeonic Cosmology and Nazism===\n\nThe ONA states that cosmic evolution is guided by a \"sinister dialectics\" of alternating Aeonic energies.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=294}} It divides history into a series of Aeons, believing that each was dominated by a human civilization that emerged, evolved, and then died.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=294|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=220}} It states that each Aeon lasts for approximately 2000 years, with its respective dominating human civilization developing within the latter 1500 years of that period.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=261}} It holds that after 800 years of growth, each civilization faces problems, resulting in a \"Time of Troubles\" that lasts from between 398 and 400 years. In each civilization's final stage is a period that lasts for approximately 390 years, in which it is controlled by a strong military and imperial regime, after which the civilization falls.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=220}} The ONA claims that humanity has lived through five such Aeons, each with an associated civilization: the Primal, Hyperborean, Sumerian, Hellenic, and Western.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=391}} Both Goodrick-Clarke and Senholt have stated that this system of Aeons is inspired by the work of [[Arnold J. Toynbee]],{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=220|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=261}} with Senholt suggesting that it might also have been influenced by Crowley's ideas regarding [[Thelema|Thelemic]] Aeons.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=261}} However, the ONA has stated that their concept \"has nothing to do with Crowley\",{{sfn|Long|1992a||p=22}} but is based on the work of both Toynbee and Spengler.{{sfn|ONA|2015|pp=678&ndash;684}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=\"[[Adolf Hitler]] was sent by our gods<br>To guide us to greatness<br>We believe in the inequality of races<br>And in the right of the [[Aryan]] to live<br>According to the laws of the folk.<br>We acknowledge that the story of the Jewish \"holocaust\"<br>Is a lie to keep our race in chains<br>And express our desire to see the truth revealed.<br>We believe in justice for our oppressed comrades<br>And seek an end to the world-wide<br>Persecution of National-Socialists.\"|source=\u2014 The ONA's \"Mass of Heresy\"{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=237}} }}\n\nThe ONA claim that current Western civilization has a [[Faustian]] ethos and that it has recently undergone its Time of Troubles, with its final stage, an \"Imperium\" of militaristic governance, due to commence at some point in 1990&ndash;2011 and last until 2390.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=220}} This will be followed by a period of chaos from which will be established a sixth Aeon, the Aeon of Fire, which will be represented by the Galactic civilization in which an Aryan society shall colonize the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=294,391|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=221}} However, the Order holds that unlike previous Aeonic civilizations, the Western has been infected with the \"Magian/Nazarene\" distorion, which they associate with Judeo-Christian religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=294|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=220|3a1=Senholt|3y=2013|3p=261}} The group's writings state that while Western civilization had once been \"a pioneering entity, imbued with elitist values and exalting the way of the warrior\", under the impact of the Magian/Nazarene ethos it has become \"essentially neurotic, inward-looking and obsessed\", embracing [[humanism]], [[capitalism]], [[communism]], as well as \"the sham of democracy\" and \"the dogma of racial equality\".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=220}} They believe that these Magian/Nazarene forces represent a counter-evolutionary trend which threaten to prevent the emergence of the Western Imperium and thus the evolution of humanity, opining that this cosmic enemy must be overcome through the force of will.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=294|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=220|3a1=Senholt|3y=2013|3p=261}} Both Goodrick-Clarke and Sieg note that these ideas regarding the \"Magian soul\" and \"cultural distortion\" brought about by Jews were derived from the work of [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Francis Parker Yockey]].{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=220|2a1=Sieg|2y=2013|2p=259}}\n\nThe ONA praise [[Nazi Germany]] as \"a practical expression of Satanic spirit&nbsp;... a burst of Luciferian light &ndash; of zest and power &ndash; in an otherwise Nazarene, pacified, and boring world.\"{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=221}} Embracing [[Holocaust denial]],{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=221}}{{sfn|ONA|2011|pp=39&ndash;45, 53&ndash;56}} they claim that the [[Holocaust]] was a myth constructed by the Magian/Nazarene establishment in order to denigrate the Nazi administration following the [[Second World War]] and erase its achievements from \"the psyche of the West\".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=221}} The group believe that a neo-Nazi revolution is necessary to overthrow the Magian-Nazarene domination of Western society and to establish the Imperium, ultimately allowing humanity to enter the Galactic civilization of the future.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=294|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=221}} \nAccordingly, positive references to Nazism and neo-Nazism can be found within the group's written material,{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=237}} and it evokes the Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]] as a positive force in its text for the performance of a [[Black Mass]],{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=155}} also known as The Mass of Heresy.{{sfn|ONA|2011|pp=757&ndash;760}} However, some ONA texts stress that members should embrace neo-Nazism and racism not out of a genuine belief in Nazi ideology, but rather as part of a \"sinister strategy\" to advance Aeonic evolution.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=294|2a1=Sieg|2y=2013|2p=259}} A version of the Black Mass-produced by an Australian ONA group, The Temple of THEM, replaces praise for Hitler with praise for Islamist militant [[Osama bin Laden]],{{sfnm|1a1=Sieg|1y=2013|1p=258|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=359}} while the writings of Chloe Ortega and Kayla DiGiovanni, key publicists for the U.S.-based White Star Acception, express what Sieg termed a \"left-anarchist\" platform which lacked the condemnation of Zionism and endorsement of [[Aryan]] racialism found in Long's writings.{{sfn|Sieg|2013|p=269}} The Order is thus far more overtly political extreme in its aims than other Satanic and Left Hand Path organisations, seeking to infiltrate and destabilise modern society through both magical and practical means.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=251}}\n\n===Initiation and the Seven Fold Way===\n\nThe ONA's core system is known as the \"Seven Fold Way\" or \"Hebdomadry\",{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=219|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=257|3a1=Monette|3y=2013|3p=95|4a1=Introvigne|4y=2016|4p=361}} and is outlined in one of the Order's primary texts, ''Naos''.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=106}} The sevenfold system is reflected in the group's symbolic [[cosmology]], the \"Tree of Wyrd\", on which seven celestial bodies &ndash; the Moon, Venus, Mercury, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn &ndash; are located.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=101}} The term ''[[wyrd]]'' was adopted from [[Old English]], where it referred to [[fate]] or [[destiny]].{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=101}} Monette identified this as a \"hermetic system\", highlighting that the use of seven planetary bodies had been influenced by the Medieval Arabic texts ''[[Picatrix|Gh\u0101yat al-\u1e24ak\u012bm]]'' and ''[[Shams I-Maarif]]''.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=106}}\nThe Seven Fold Way is also reflected in the group's initiatory system, which has seven grades through which the member can gradually progress.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=219|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=257|3a1=Monette|3y=2013|3p=95}} These are: (1) Neophyte, (2) Initiate, (3) External Adept, (4) Internal Adept, (5) Master/Mistress, (6) Grand Master/Mousa and (7) Immortal.{{sfnm|1a1=Senholt|1y=2013|1p=258|2a1=Monette|2y=2013|2pp=95&ndash;96}} The group has revealed that very few of its members raise to the fifth and sixth degrees,{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=259}} and in a 1989 article the ONA stated that at that point there were only four individuals who had reached the stage of Master.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=259}}\n\n[[File:Gadewar.jpg|thumb|right|The ONA encourages its members to adopt \"insight roles\" in anarchist, neo-Nazi, and Islamist groups in order to disrupt modern Western society.]]\n\nThe ONA does not initiate members into the group itself, but rather expects an individual to initiate themselves.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=96}} It requires that initiates be in a good physical condition, and recommends a training regimen for prospective members to follow.{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=236}}  Newcomers are expected to take on a magical partner of the opposite sex,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}} or of the same sex if they are lesbian or gay.{{sfn|ONA|2015|p=467}} Thenceforth, the practitioner must undertake personal and increasingly difficult challenges in order to move through the different grades.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=96}} Most of the ordeals that allow the initiate to proceed to the next stage are publicly revealed by the Order in its introductory material, as it is believed that the true initiatory element lies in the experience itself and can only be attained through performing them.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=258}} For instance, part of the ritual to become an External Adept involves an ordeal in which the prospective member is to find a lonely spot and to lie there, still, for an entire night without moving or sleeping.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=236|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=258}} The initiatory process for the role of Internal Adept entails the practitioner withdrawing from human society for three months, from an equinox to a solstice, or (more usually) for six months,{{sfn|ONA|2015|pp=201&ndash;203}} during which time they must live in the wild without modern conveniences or contact with civilisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1pp=236&ndash;237|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=219|3a1=Senholt|3y=2013|3p=258}}  The next stage \u2013 the Ritual of the Abyss \u2013 involves the candidate living alone in a dark isolated cavern for a lunar month.{{sfn|ONA|2015|pp=1446&ndash;1459}} According to Jeffrey Kaplan, an academic specialist of the far right, these physically and mentally challenging initiatory tasks reflect \"the ONA's conception of itself as a vanguard organization composed of a tiny coterie of Nietzschean elites.\"{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=237}}\n\nWithin the initiatory system of the ONA, there is an emphasis on practitioners adopting \"insight roles\" in which they work undercover among a politically extreme group for a period of six to eighteen months, thus gaining experience in something different from their normal life.{{sfnm|1a1=Senholt|1y=2013|1p=269|2a1=Monette|2y=2013|2p=96}} Among the ideological trends that the ONA suggests its members adopt \"insight roles\" within are [[anarchism]], neo-Nazism, and [[Islamism]], stating that aside from the personal benefits of such an involvement, membership of these groups has the benefit of undermining the Magian-Nazarene socio-political system of the West and thus helping to bring about the instability from which a new order, the Imperium, can emerge.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=269}} However, Monette noted a potential shift in the insight roles recommended by the group over the decades; he highlighted that while the ONA recommended criminal or military activities during the 1980s and early 1990s, by the late 1990s and 2000s they were instead recommending Buddhist monasticism as an insight role for practitioners to adopt.{{sfn|Monette|2013|pp=96&ndash;97}}\nTherefore, \"through the practice of \"insight roles\", the order advocates continuous transgression of established norms, roles, and comfort zones in the development of the initiate&nbsp;... This extreme application of ideas further amplifies the ambiguity of satanic and Left Hand Path practices of [[Antinomianism#Left-hand path|antinomianism]], making it almost impossible to penetrate the layers of subversion, play and counter-dichotomy inherent in the sinister dialectics.\"{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=15}} Senholt suggested that Myatt's involvement with both neo-Nazism and Islamism represent such \"insight roles\" in his own life.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|pp=267, 269}}\n\n===The Acausal Realm, Magick and the Dark Gods===\n\nThe ONA believe that humans live within the ''causal'' realm, which obeys the laws of cause and effect. However, they also believe in an ''acausal'' realm, in which the laws of physics do not apply, further promoting the idea that numinous energies from the acausal realm can be drawn into the causal, allowing for the performance of magic.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=100}} Believing in the existence of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] &ndash; which the group spell \"magick\" following the example of [[Elias Ashmole]]'s 1652 work ''[[Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Further Notes Concerning The Hermetic Origins Of The O9A |author=R.

The first entails rites and chants with the intent of opening a gateway &ndash; known as a \"nexion\" &ndash; to the \"acausal realm\" in order to manifest energies in the \"causal realm\" that will influence the existing aeon in the practitioner's desired direction.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|pp=261&ndash;262}} The second method involves playing an advanced form of a board game known as the Star Game; the game was devised by the group, with the game pieces representing different aeons. The group believes that when an initiate plays the game they can become a \"living nexion\" and thus a channel for acausal energies to enter the causal realm and effect aeonic change.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=1998|1p=116|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=262}} An advanced form of the game is used as part of the training for the grade of Internal Adept.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}} According to Myatt, he invented the game in 1975.<ref name=Myatt-stargame>{{cite web |url=https://davidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/star-game-history.pdf |accessdate=21 September 2015 |title=The Star Game: History and Theory |website=David Myatt |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bicJedT9?url=https://davidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/star-game-history.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Order promotes the idea that \"Dark Gods\" exist within the acausal realm, although it is accepted that some members will interpret them not as real entities but as facets of the human subconscious.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=103}} These entities are perceived as dangerous, with the ONA advising caution when interacting with them.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=103}} Among those Dark Gods whose identities have been discussed in the Order's publicly available material are a goddess named [[Baphomet]] who is depicted as a mature woman carrying a severed head,{{sfn|Monette|2013|pp=103&ndash;105}} with the ONA stating that the name is of ancient Greek origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://omega9alpha.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/baphomet-esoteric-v3a.pdf|accessdate=21 September 2015|title=Baphomet, An Esoteric Signification|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922111657/https://omega9alpha.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/baphomet-esoteric-v3a.pdf|archivedate = 22 September 2015}}</ref> In addition, there are entities whose names, according to Monette, are borrowed from or influenced by figures from Classical sources and [[astronomy]], such as Kthunae, Nemicu, and Atazoth.{{sfn|Monette|2013|pp=103&ndash;105}}\n\nAnother of these acausal figures is termed Vindex, after the Latin word for \"avenger\". The ONA believe that Vindex will eventually incarnate as a human &ndash; although the gender and ethnicity of this individual is unknown &ndash; through the successful \"presencing\" of acausal energies within the causal realm, and that they will act as a messianic figure by overthrowing the Magian forces and leading the ONA to prominence in the establishment of a new society.{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1pp=104, 108&ndash;109|2a1=Sieg|2y=2013|2pp=260, 265&ndash;266|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3p=360}} Sieg drew comparisons between this belief in Vindex and the ideas of [[Savitri Devi]], the prominent [[Esoteric Hitlerism|Esoteric Hitlerist]], regarding the arrival of [[Kalki]], an avatar of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]], to Earth.{{sfn|Sieg|2013|pp=259&ndash;260}} The ONA also propagate the idea that it is possible for the practitioner to secure an [[afterlife]] within the acausal realm through their spiritual activities.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=101}} It is for this reason that the final stage of the Seven Fold Way is known as the \"Immortal\", constituting those initiates who have been able to advance to the stage of dwelling in the acausal realm.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=101}}\n\n===Human sacrifice===\n\nThe ONA's writings condone and encourage human sacrifice,{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1pp=218&ndash;219|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=155}} referring to their victims as ''opfers''.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}}\nThe ONA outline their views on human sacrifice in a number of documents: \"A Gift for the Prince &ndash; A Guide to Human Sacrifice\", \"Culling &ndash; A Guide to Sacrifice II\", \"Victims &ndash; A Sinister Expos\u00e9\", and \"Guidelines for the Testing of Opfers\".{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|pp=237&ndash;238}} According to the ONA's beliefs, the killer must allow their victim to \"self-select\" themselves; this is achieved through testing the victim to see if they expose perceived character faults. If this proves to be the case, the victim is believed to have shown that they are worthy of death, and the sacrifice can commence.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=237|2a1=Ryan|2y=2003|2p=54}} Those deemed ideal for sacrifice by the group include individuals perceived as being of low character, members of what they deem \"sham-Satanic groups\" like the Church of Satan and Temple of Set, as well as \"zealous, interfering Nazarenes\", and journalists, business figures and political activists who disrupt the group's operations.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=293&ndash;294|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=155}} The ONA explains that because of the need for such \"self-selection\", children must never be victims of sacrifice.{{sfnm|1a1=Harvey|1y=1995|1p=292|2a1=Kaplan|2y=2000|2p=237}} Similarly, the ONA \"despise animal sacrifice, maintaining that it is much better to sacrifice suitable mundanes given the abundance of human dross\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.o9a.org/wp-content/uploads/praxis-and-theory-of-the-o9a.pdf |accessdate=21 September 2015 |title=Praxis and Theory of the Order of Nine

|url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe sacrifice is then carried out through either physical or magical means, at which point the killer is believed to absorb power from the body and spirit of the victim, thus entering a new level of \"sinister\" consciousness.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=237|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=293}} As well as strengthening the character of the killer by heightening their connection with the acausal forces of death and destruction,{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=293|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=219}} such sacrifices are also viewed as having wider benefits by the ONA, because they remove from society individuals whom the group deems to be worthless human beings.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=293}} Monette noted that no ONA nexion cells publicly admitted to carrying out a sacrifice in a ritual manner, but that members had joined the police and military groups in order to engage in legal violence and killing.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=114}}\n\nThe ONA believe that there are historical precedents to their practice of human sacrifice, expressing belief in a prehistoric tradition in which humans were sacrificed to a goddess named [[Baphomet]] at the spring equinox and to the [[Arcturus]] star in the autumn.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}} However, the ONA's advocacy of human sacrifice has drawn strong criticism from other Satanist groups like the Temple of Set, who deem it to be detrimental to their own attempts to make Satanism more socially acceptable within Western nations.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}}\n\n===The term \"nine angles\"===\n\nIn its essays and other writings, the ONA offers various differing explanations as to the meaning of the term \"Nine Angles\".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=105}} One explanation is that it pertains to the seven planets of the group's cosmology (the seven angles), added to the system as a whole (the eighth angle), and the mystic themselves (the ninth angle).{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1p=105|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=360}} A second explanation is that it refers to seven \"normal\" [[alchemy|alchemical]] stages, with an additional two processes.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=105}} A third is that it pertains to the nine emanations of the divine, a concept originally found in Medieval texts produced within the Islamic mystical tradition of [[Sufism]].{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=105}} Monette further suggested that it was a reference to a classical Indian tradition which divided the [[solar system]] into nine planets.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=105}}\n\nAccording to the O9A, they use the term \"nine angles\" in reference to not only the nine emanations, and transformations, of the three basic alchemical substances (mercury, sulfur, salt) as occurs in their occult use of the Star Game,<ref name=\"Myatt-stargame\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/the-star-game/

The Greek wing of the ONA goes by the name Mir\u00f3s tou Ze\u00fas.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}} Some of these groups, such as the U.S.-based Tempel ov Blood, describe themselves as being distinct from the ONA while both having been greatly influenced by it and having connections to it.{{sfn|Monette|2013|pp=89, 90}}\n\nIn the ONA's terminology, the terms Drecc and Niner refer to folk-based or gang-based culture or individuals who support the Order's aims by practical (including criminal) means rather than esoteric ones.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=89}} One such group is the White Star Acception, who claim to have perpetrated rapes, assaults, and robberies in order to advance the group's power; Sieg noted that the reality of these actions has not been verified.{{sfn|Sieg|2013|pp=270&ndash;271}}\nA Balobian is an artist or musician who contributes to the group through their production of [[fine art]].{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=89}} The Rounwytha is a tradition of folk-mystics deemed to exhibit gifted [[psychic]] powers reflecting their embodiment of the \"sinister feminine archetype\".

Claiming to have been established in the 1960s, it rose to public recognition in the early 1980s, attracting attention for its [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] ideologies and activism. Describing its approach as \"[[Theistic Satanism|Traditional Satanism]]\", it has been identified by academic researchers as also exhibiting [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] and [[Modern paganism|modern Pagan]] elements in its beliefs.\n\n<!--History of the ONA-->\nAccording to the Order's own account, it was established in the [[Welsh Marches]] of Western England during the late 1960s by a woman who had previously been involved in a secretive pre-Christian sect surviving in the region. This account also states that in 1973 a man named \"Anton Long\" was initiated into the group, subsequently becoming its Grand Master. Several academic commentators to have studied the ONA express the view that the name \"Anton Long\" is probably the pseudonym of the British neo-Nazi activist [[David Myatt]], although Myatt has denied that this is the case. From the late 1970s onward, Long authored a number of books and articles propagating the Order's ideas, and in 1988 it began production of its own journal, ''Fenrir''. Through these ventures it established links with other neo-Nazi Satanist groups around the world, furthering its cause through embracing the [[Internet]] in the 2000s.\n\n<!--Beliefs-->\nThe ONA promotes the idea that human history can be divided into a series of Aeons, each of which contain a corresponding human civilization. It expresses the view that the current Aeonic civilization is that of the [[Western culture|Western]], but claims that the evolution of this society is threatened by the \"Magian/Nazarene\u201d influence of [[Judeo-Christian]] religion, which the Order seeks to combat in order to establish a militaristic new social order, termed the \"Imperium\". According to Order teachings, this is necessary in order for a Galactic civilization to form, in which \"[[Aryan race|Aryan]]\" society will colonise the [[Milky Way]]. It advocates a spiritual path in which the practitioner is required to break societal taboos by isolating themselves from society, committing crimes, embracing political extremism and violence, and carrying out an act of [[human sacrifice]]. ONA members practice [[magic (paranormal)|magick]], believing that they are able to do so through channeling [[Energy (esotericism)|energies]] into our own \"causal\" realm from an \"acausal\" realm where the laws of physics do not apply, with such magical actions designed to aid in the ultimate establishment of the Imperium.\n\n<!--Structure and organisation-->\nThe ONA lacks any central authority or structure, instead operating as a broad network of associates &ndash; termed the \"kollective\" &ndash; who are inspired by the texts originally authored by Long and other members of the \"Inner ONA\". The group comprises largely of clandestine cells, termed \"nexions.\" With the first nexion based in [[Shropshire]], Western England, the majority of groups have been established in the British Isles and Germany, although others have been formed elsewhere in Europe, Russia, South Africa, Australia, and North America. Some academic estimates suggest that the number of individuals broadly associated with the Order falls in the low thousands. Various killings and [[terrorism|terroristic]] activities have been perpetrated by far-right activists influenced by the ONA's teachings, with various British politicians and activists calling for the ONA to be proscribed as a terrorist group. It has been described as one of the most extreme and dangerous Satanist groups in the world.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\n[[File:Shropshire UK locator map 2010.svg|thumb|right|The ONA's first cell, \"Nexion Zero\", was established in Shropshire (pictured).{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}}]]\n\nAcademics have found it difficult to ascertain \"exact and verifiable information\" about the ONA's origins given the secrecy with which the group shields itself.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=255}} As with many other occult organisations, the Order shrouds its history in \"mystery and legend\", creating a \"mythical narrative\" for its origins and development.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=255}} The ONA claims to be the descendant of pre-Christian [[paganism|pagan]] traditions which survived the [[Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianisation of Britain]] and which were passed down from the Middle Ages onward in small groups or \"temples\" based in the [[Welsh Marches]] &ndash; a border area between England and Wales &ndash; which were each led by a Grand Master or Grand Mistress.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=236|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=218}} According to the Order, in the late 1960s a Grand Mistress of one such group united three of these temples &ndash; Camlad, the Temple of the Sun, and The Noctulians &ndash; to form the ONA,{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}} before welcoming outsiders into the tradition.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=236|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=391}}\n\nAccording to the Order's account, one of those whom the Grand Mistress initiated into the group was \"Anton Long\", an individual who described himself as a British citizen who had spent much of his youth visiting Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=86}} Long claimed that prior to his involvement in the ONA he had been interested in occultism for several years, having contacted a [[coven]] based in [[The Fens|Fenland]] in 1968, before moving to London and joining groups that practiced [[ceremonial magic]] in the style of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and [[Aleister Crowley]].{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=255}} He also claimed a brief involvement in a Satanic group based in [[Manchester]], the [[Orthodox Temple of the Prince]] run by Ray Bogart, during which time he encountered the ONA Grand Mistress.{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1p=86|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3p=357}} According to the Order's account, Long joined the ONA in 1973 &ndash; the first to have done so in five years &ndash; and became the Grand Mistress' heir.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=217|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}} He later recalled that at that time the group held rituals at [[henges]] and [[Stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany|stone circles]] around the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=255}}\n\nThis account further states that when the Order's Grand Mistress migrated to Australia, Long took over as the group's new Grand Master.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}} The group claimed that Long \"implemented the next stage of Sinister Strategy &ndash;

the Moon, Venus, Mercury, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn &ndash; are located.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=101}} The term ''[[wyrd]]'' was adopted from [[Old English]], where it referred to [[fate]] or [[destiny]].{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=101}} Monette identified this as a \"hermetic system\", highlighting that the use of seven planetary bodies had been influenced by the Medieval Arabic texts ''[[Picatrix|Gh\u0101yat al-\u1e24ak\u012bm]]'' and ''[[Shams I-Maarif]]''.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=106}}\nThe Seven Fold Way is also reflected in the group's initiatory system, which has seven grades through which the member can gradually progress.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=219|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=257|3a1=Monette|3y=2013|3p=95}} These are: (1) Neophyte, (2) Initiate, (3) External Adept, (4) Internal Adept, (5) Master/Mistress, (6) Grand Master/Mousa and (7) Immortal.{{sfnm|1a1=Senholt|1y=2013|1p=258|2a1=Monette|2y=2013|2pp=95&ndash;96}} The group has revealed that very few of its members raise to the fifth and sixth degrees,{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=259}} and in a 1989 article the ONA stated that at that point there were only four individuals who had reached the stage of Master.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=259}}\n\n[[File:Gadewar.jpg|thumb|right|The ONA encourages its members to adopt \"insight roles\" in anarchist, neo-Nazi, and Islamist groups in order to disrupt modern Western society.]]\n\nThe ONA does not initiate members into the group itself, but rather expects an individual to initiate themselves.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=96}} It requires that initiates be in a good physical condition, and recommends a training regimen for prospective members to follow.{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=236}}  Newcomers are expected to take on a magical partner of the opposite sex,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}} or of the same sex if they are lesbian or gay.{{sfn|ONA|2015|p=467}} Thenceforth, the practitioner must undertake personal and increasingly difficult challenges in order to move through the different grades.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=96}} Most of the ordeals that allow the initiate to proceed to the next stage are publicly revealed by the Order in its introductory material, as it is believed that the true initiatory element lies in the experience itself and can only be attained through performing them.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=258}} For instance, part of the ritual to become an External Adept involves an ordeal in which the prospective member is to find a lonely spot and to lie there, still, for an entire night without moving or sleeping.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=236|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=258}} The initiatory process for the role of Internal Adept entails the practitioner withdrawing from human society for three months, from an equinox to a solstice, or (more usually) for six months,{{sfn|ONA|2015|pp=201&ndash;203}} during which time they must live in the wild without modern conveniences or contact with civilisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1pp=236&ndash;237|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=219|3a1=Senholt|3y=2013|3p=258}}  The next stage \u2013 the Ritual of the Abyss \u2013 involves the candidate living alone in a dark isolated cavern for a lunar month.{{sfn|ONA|2015|pp=1446&ndash;1459}} According to Jeffrey Kaplan, an academic specialist of the far right, these physically and mentally challenging initiatory tasks reflect \"the ONA's conception of itself as a vanguard organization composed of a tiny coterie of Nietzschean elites.\"{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=237}}\n\nWithin the initiatory system of the ONA, there is an emphasis on practitioners adopting \"insight roles\" in which they work undercover among a politically extreme group for a period of six to eighteen months, thus gaining experience in something different from their normal life.{{sfnm|1a1=Senholt|1y=2013|1p=269|2a1=Monette|2y=2013|2p=96}} Among the ideological trends that the ONA suggests its members adopt \"insight roles\" within are [[anarchism]], neo-Nazism, and [[Islamism]], stating that aside from the personal benefits of such an involvement, membership of these groups has the benefit of undermining the Magian-Nazarene socio-political system of the West and thus helping to bring about the instability from which a new order, the Imperium, can emerge.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=269}} However, Monette noted a potential shift in the insight roles recommended by the group over the decades; he highlighted that while the ONA recommended criminal or military activities during the 1980s and early 1990s, by the late 1990s and 2000s they were instead recommending Buddhist monasticism as an insight role for practitioners to adopt.{{sfn|Monette|2013|pp=96&ndash;97}}\nTherefore, \"through the practice of \"insight roles\", the order advocates continuous transgression of established norms, roles, and comfort zones in the development of the initiate&nbsp;... This extreme application of ideas further amplifies the ambiguity of satanic and Left Hand Path practices of [[Antinomianism#Left-hand path|antinomianism]], making it almost impossible to penetrate the layers of subversion, play and counter-dichotomy inherent in the sinister dialectics.\"{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=15}} Senholt suggested that Myatt's involvement with both neo-Nazism and Islamism represent such \"insight roles\" in his own life.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|pp=267, 269}}\n\n===The Acausal Realm, Magick and the Dark Gods===\n\nThe ONA believe that humans live within the ''causal'' realm, which obeys the laws of cause and effect. However, they also believe in an ''acausal'' realm, in which the laws of physics do not apply, further promoting the idea that numinous energies from the acausal realm can be drawn into the causal, allowing for the performance of magic.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=100}} Believing in the existence of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] &ndash; which the group spell \"magick\" following the example of [[Elias Ashmole]]'s 1652 work ''[[Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Further Notes Concerning The Hermetic Origins Of The O9A |author=R.

Chromolitho Wellcome V0045066.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The ONA Dark Goddess Baphomet has been described as having \"strong parallels\" with the Hindu Goddess Kali (pictured){{sfn|Monette|2013|pp=103&ndash;104}}]]\n\nThe ONA utilises two methods in its performance of aeonic magick. The first entails rites and chants with the intent of opening a gateway &ndash; known as a \"nexion\" &ndash; to the \"acausal realm\" in order to manifest energies in the \"causal realm\" that will influence the existing aeon in the practitioner's desired direction.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|pp=261&ndash;262}} The second method involves playing an advanced form of a board game known as the Star Game; the game was devised by the group, with the game pieces representing different aeons. The group believes that when an initiate plays the game they can become a \"living nexion\" and thus a channel for acausal energies to enter the causal realm and effect aeonic change.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=1998|1p=116|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=262}} An advanced form of the game is used as part of the training for the grade of Internal Adept.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}} According to Myatt, he invented the game in 1975.<ref name=Myatt-stargame>{{cite web |url=https://davidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/star-game-history.pdf |accessdate=21 September 2015 |title=The Star Game: History and Theory |website=David Myatt |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bicJedT9?url=https://davidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/star-game-history.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Order promotes the idea that \"Dark Gods\" exist within the acausal realm, although it is accepted that some members will interpret them not as real entities but as facets of the human subconscious.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=103}} These entities are perceived as dangerous, with the ONA advising caution when interacting with them.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=103}} Among those Dark Gods whose identities have been discussed in the Order's publicly available material are a goddess named [[Baphomet]] who is depicted as a mature woman carrying a severed head,{{sfn|Monette|2013|pp=103&ndash;105}} with the ONA stating that the name is of ancient Greek origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://omega9alpha.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/baphomet-esoteric-v3a.pdf|accessdate=21 September 2015|title=Baphomet, An Esoteric Signification|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922111657/https://omega9alpha.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/baphomet-esoteric-v3a.pdf|archivedate = 22 September 2015}}</ref> In addition, there are entities whose names, according to Monette, are borrowed from or influenced by figures from Classical sources and [[astronomy]], such as Kthunae, Nemicu, and Atazoth.{{sfn|Monette|2013|pp=103&ndash;105}}\n\nAnother of these acausal figures is termed Vindex, after the Latin word for \"avenger\". The ONA believe that Vindex will eventually incarnate as a human &ndash; although the gender and ethnicity of this individual is unknown &ndash; through the successful \"presencing\" of acausal energies within the causal realm, and that they will act as a messianic figure by overthrowing the Magian forces and leading the ONA to prominence in the establishment of a new society.{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1pp=104, 108&ndash;109|2a1=Sieg|2y=2013|2pp=260, 265&ndash;266|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3p=360}} Sieg drew comparisons between this belief in Vindex and the ideas of [[Savitri Devi]], the prominent [[Esoteric Hitlerism|Esoteric Hitlerist]], regarding the arrival of [[Kalki]], an avatar of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]], to Earth.{{sfn|Sieg|2013|pp=259&ndash;260}} The ONA also propagate the idea that it is possible for the practitioner to secure an [[afterlife]] within the acausal realm through their spiritual activities.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=101}} It is for this reason that the final stage of the Seven Fold Way is known as the \"Immortal\", constituting those initiates who have been able to advance to the stage of dwelling in the acausal realm.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=101}}\n\n===Human sacrifice===\n\nThe ONA's writings condone and encourage human sacrifice,{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1pp=218&ndash;219|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=155}} referring to their victims as ''opfers''.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}}\nThe ONA outline their views on human sacrifice in a number of documents: \"A Gift for the Prince &ndash; A Guide to Human Sacrifice\", \"Culling &ndash; A Guide to Sacrifice II\", \"Victims &ndash; A Sinister Expos\u00e9\", and \"Guidelines for the Testing of Opfers\".{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|pp=237&ndash;238}} According to the ONA's beliefs, the killer must allow their victim to \"self-select\" themselves; this is achieved through testing the victim to see if they expose perceived character faults. If this proves to be the case, the victim is believed to have shown that they are worthy of death, and the sacrifice can commence.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=237|2a1=Ryan|2y=2003|2p=54}} Those deemed ideal for sacrifice by the group include individuals perceived as being of low character, members of what they deem \"sham-Satanic groups\" like the Church of Satan and Temple of Set, as well as \"zealous, interfering Nazarenes\", and journalists, business figures and political activists who disrupt the group's operations.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=293&ndash;294|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=155}} The ONA explains that because of the need for such \"self-selection\", children must never be victims of sacrifice.{{sfnm|1a1=Harvey|1y=1995|1p=292|2a1=Kaplan|2y=2000|2p=237}} Similarly, the ONA \"despise animal sacrifice, maintaining that it is much better to sacrifice suitable mundanes given the abundance of human dross\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.o9a.org/wp-content/uploads/praxis-and-theory-of-the-o9a.pdf |accessdate=21 September 2015 |title=Praxis and Theory of the Order of Nine

|url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe sacrifice is then carried out through either physical or magical means, at which point the killer is believed to absorb power from the body and spirit of the victim, thus entering a new level of \"sinister\" consciousness.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=237|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=293}} As well as strengthening the character of the killer by heightening their connection with the acausal forces of death and destruction,{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=293|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=219}} such sacrifices are also viewed as having wider benefits by the ONA, because they remove from society individuals whom the group deems to be worthless human beings.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=293}} Monette noted that no ONA nexion cells publicly admitted to carrying out a sacrifice in a ritual manner, but that members had joined the police and military groups in order to engage in legal violence and killing.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=114}}\n\nThe ONA believe that there are historical precedents to their practice of human sacrifice, expressing belief in a prehistoric tradition in which humans were sacrificed to a goddess named [[Baphomet]] at the spring equinox and to the [[Arcturus]] star in the autumn.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}} However, the ONA's advocacy of human sacrifice has drawn strong criticism from other Satanist groups like the Temple of Set, who deem it to be detrimental to their own attempts to make Satanism more socially acceptable within Western nations.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}}\n\n===The term \"nine angles\"===\n\nIn its essays and other writings, the ONA offers various differing explanations as to the meaning of the term \"Nine Angles\".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=105}} One explanation is that it pertains to the seven planets of the group's cosmology (the seven angles), added to the system as a whole (the eighth angle), and the mystic themselves (the ninth angle).{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1p=105|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=360}} A second explanation is that it refers to seven \"normal\" [[alchemy|alchemical]] stages, with an additional two processes.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=105}} A third is that it pertains to the nine emanations of the divine, a concept originally found in Medieval texts produced within the Islamic mystical tradition of [[Sufism]].{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=105}} Monette further suggested that it was a reference to a classical Indian tradition which divided the [[solar system]] into nine planets.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=105}}\n\nAccording to the O9A, they use the term \"nine angles\" in reference to not only the nine emanations, and transformations, of the three basic alchemical substances (mercury, sulfur, salt) as occurs in their occult use of the Star Game,<ref name=\"Myatt-stargame\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/the-star-game/
