Most games consist of four players, but there are also two- and six-player variants. Differences include where the players line up and infraction penalties, among others. The materials used in roundnet include a small [[trampoline]]-like object with string netting, a small [[bouncing ball]] with a 12-inch circumference, and four players. Players initially line up directly across from one another, forming an even diamond around the net at the start of a point. In all versions, the game starts with a [[serve (volleyball)|serve]] from one team to another, continues as long as the ball is being hit by players back to the net, and ends when an infraction occurs between either the players or the ball. The game is constantly evolving, with new defensive strategies, serving stances, and playstyles being developed every season. The first ever Roundnet World Championship is scheduled this September 2020 in Belgium.\n[[File:Spikeball Roundnet Association.jpg|thumb|Highest governing body of roundnet<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tournaments.spikeball.com/|title=Spikeball Roundnet Association|website=Spikeball Roundnet Association|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>]]\n<br />\n\n==Roundnet Basics==\nSometimes referred to as [[Spikeball]], this sport features elements from other sports such as Volleyball and [[Four square|4-Square]]. First, 2 teams of 2 people are formed. Players are positioned at 4 points around the net, with partners located at neighboring positions. From here, one player serves the ball across the net to an opposing team member. The opposing team then has 3 hits to return the ball to the net. After the serve, there are no boundaries of play. Participants are free to run, set, and spike the ball from anywhere around the net. Play continues until a team fails to return the ball or the ball hits a rim piece, at which point the point ends, and the other team receives 1 point.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc1pEqCGWnw</ref>\n\n== Rules==\nSource:<ref name=\":1\">https://tournaments.spikeball.com/pages/official-rules-1</ref>\n[[File:Roundnet court.jpg|thumb|Roundnet court, a serving circle with a diameter of 15ft, the 3ft net is place in the middle, making the serving circle 6ft away from the net. Also an example of how the teams are set up.|alt=]]\n\n=== Setup ===\nMaterials needed for roundnet include a trampoline-like net, and a small ball with a 12-inch circumference. Players line up in a square around the net with their partner to one side, and a member of the opposing team on the other. Each partner is ninety degrees away from the next player. Before the point starts, players will always be across the net from an opponent and next to their teammate. \n\nEach point begins with a serve, usually done by the team who won the previous point. To determine who serves first in the match, teams will play a game of rock paper scissors with the winner of the rock paper scissors game receiving the option to serve first or receive first. During the serve, all players who are not receiving the serve have to line up in their designated positions outside of 6 feet from their section of the rim. The returner can stand wherever they want prior to the serve.\n\nOnce the ball is served, all players on both teams can move wherever they may like. After the ball is served, the possession is assumed by the returning team. Once the ball is hit and returned by the non-serving team and hits the net, the possession is flipped. This continues throughout the point, as possession changes whenever the ball hits the net. During each possession, teams have three hits but do not have to use all of their hits.\n\nTo account for harsh sunlight, wind, or any other condition outside of the game; players will rotate serving positions ninety degrees every five points. Only a maximum of 3 touches are permitted.\n\n=== Serving ===\nThe first serve starts the game, and the setup is dictated by the first receiver. The server then stands directly across from the receiver, and only the designated receiver may receive the serve. To serve, the server must throw the ball at least 4 inches away from the release point to begin the serve. The ball is not allowed to be interfered with during the serve. For each point, the server is allowed two serves to complete a legal serve. If they catch, swing at and miss, or drop the tossed ball, it results in a service fault. Servers must be behind the six-foot line away from the net to be eligible for the play. The server cannot lean over the line in order to get closer to the net, and their feet and entire body must be behind the line until the ball is contacted. The server is allowed to take a pivot step, but cannot move further than a pivot. The server can hit the ball at any speed and direction including drop shots. For the serve to be eligible, the ball must not go any higher than the receiver's raised hand. If the ball does this, the receivers must call fault before a second touch occurs or the ball hits the ground. The serving team will have one more try to serve it correctly, or they lose the point. When serving, if the ball hits what is known as a \"pocket\" (the area of the net that is right next to the rim) then the receiving team can call a fault and the server can attempt another serve. If a fault is not called, then the play continues. If two faults occur back to back, the receiving team is awarded the point and possession switches sides. If the serving team wins the point, the server must switch places with their teammate to serve to the other receiver. If the receiving team wins the point, they get to serve the next point.\n\n=== Contacting the ball ===\nRules and regulations exist when the ball is in play. When a team has possession, they must alternate touches, so no double hits happen. The ball must be hit; it cannot be lifted, caught or thrown. Players must use one hand to hit the ball; two-hand hits result in an [[infraction]] and loss of point. Any part of the body may be used to hit the ball. However, if the ball hits any part of the body (even if not the hands), then it may not be hit a second time. In other words, you cannot hit the ball twice in a row no matter what part of the body the ball touches, including if the ball touches elsewhere than the hands. If the ball hits the ground or the rim at any point during the rally, the play ends and a point is given to the other team. If the teams could not determine whether the ball hit the rim or a pocket, the play is replayed. When the ball hits the net, it must clear the rim for the play to be continued. If the ball hits the net again, a double bounce is called and point given to the assuming receiving team. If during a rally the ball hits the pocket, the rally continues. Pockets are only a fault during serves. If the ball makes contact with the net and then proceeds to roll up into the rim, this is known as a \"roll-up\". If this occurs during a serve, the receiving team may call a fault and the serve is tried again. If a roll-up occurs during a rally, it is treated as a pocket, and the rally continues.\n\nInfractions exist even if a team does not have assumed possession, these are called hinders. These include if a defensive player gets in the way of the team going for the ball. It is required that defensive players make an effort to get out of the way to avoid interference. If a player gets in the way of the play, the opposing team must call \"hinder\". They will then be able to replay the point. The offensive team must have a legitimate reason to call \"hinder\". If the defensive player makes an attempt to play at the ball if they do not have possession, they lose the point. If a player hits a shot that hits off the net and hits either themselves or their teammate, they lose the point. If a player makes contact with the set, it results in the loss of the point. Even if the player hit a \"kill shot\", you will lose the point if you touch the set until the ball makes contact with the ground.\n[[File:Roundnet Serve.jpg|thumb|An amateur player shows off the eponymous \"spike\" of Spikeball]]\n\n=== Scoring ===\nScoring in roundnet is dictated by \"rally scoring\", meaning that a team may earn a point whether they are serving or not. Games are usually played to 21 points, but the tournament organizer can change that at his/her discretion. As is common with similar games such as [[Table tennis|ping-pong]], [[tennis]], and volleyball, teams can only win by two points. This can lead to [[Glossary of tennis terms#D|deuces]] and point-advantages until a team wins by 2 points. Points can be scored in these ways:\n\n* When the ball doesn't hit the net within three hits during a possession\n* The ball hits the ground\n* The ball hits the rim. (This includes during serves)\n* The ball does not bounce off the net on a single bounce, also known as a double hit. The ball must clear the rim of the net completely.\n* There are two illegal serves in a row.\n* The player hits themselves or their teammate with the ball after it makes contact with the net<br>\n\n== Skills ==\nMany competitive teams and players master these 4 fundamental skills: serve, pass/dig/set, attack (spike), and the body block. These skills are standard practice for high-level advanced, premier, or pro division players.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UColRVNu-hSF_NJJnRNc3dOg|title=Preston Bies|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref><br />\n\n=== Serve ===\nThe server stands behind the 6 foot serving line, in attempt to hit the ball onto the net. The servers main goal is to hit a clean serve that will result in a bad touch or a possible \"ace\". A serve is called an \"ace\" when the server hits the ball onto the net, bounces off clean, and the ball goes untouched by the receiver and hits the ground, or the ball hits the ground before the receiver can touch it, or the receiver has a bad touch and the ball goes off in a different direction, resulting in the ball hitting the ground. \n\nIn present-day roundnet, several types of serves are implemented: \n\n* Basic serve: Used by most beginners. When you hit the ball with a flat hand giving the ball little to no spin. The basic serve is rarely used in high-level games and tournaments, because of how easy the serve is to receive. Can be performed in any serving stance\n* Topspin/Jam/Backdoor serve<ref>{{Citation|title=HOW TO ROUNDNET: Back Door/Jam Serve|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSz4vvYIJVk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>: The most commonly used serve in the sport of roundnet. It's when the player tosses the ball and hits the ball with top spin, which makes the ball go shooting forward at the receiver. When hit hard this serve can be extremely difficult to receive. This serve can be performed in multiple serving stances.\n* Drop serve<ref>{{Citation|title=HOW TO ROUNDNET: The Drop Serve|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6VG1OWh1tA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>: Another very commonly used serve in the sport of roundnet. When the player tosses the ball and hits the ball with a bit of back spin, which results in the ball dropping in-front of the receiver. When the serve is placed properly it can be extremely difficult to defend if you are further back receiving the hard driven serves. This serve can be performed in multiple serving stances.\n* Cut serve<ref>{{Citation|title=HOW TO ROUNDNET: The Cut Serve|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYhdRwhyqC4|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>: Used by higher level players, you will rarely see this serve in the beginner or intermediate levels. When the server tosses the ball and hits the ball with side spin and top spin, making the ball bounce off the net wider than expected by the receiver. When this serve is placed on the net with tons of power and spin it can be extremely hard for the receiver to get a touch. This serve can be used in most stances, may be more difficult for certain stances.\n\n=== Pass/Dig/Set ===\nA pass or a dig is used to properly receive the opponents serve or any type of hit. To properly handle the serve or hit, you not only have to prevent it from hitting the ground, you also want to give your partner a nice pass to give you a nice set.\n\nThere are two different techniques used to pass the ball, they can be used in different circumstances:\n\n* Under hand pass<ref>{{Citation|title=HOW TO ROUNDNET: The Perfect Underhand Set|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XJC6yzLCZI|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>: When you make a platform with your hand for the ball to bounce off the palm of your hand. Most commonly used for setting your partner.\n* Over head pass<ref>{{Citation|title=HOW TO ROUNDNET: Overhead & Deep Gets/Sets|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idydjh393ds|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>: Essentially the same contact with the under hand pass, but pushing the ball over head. Most commonly used when receiving the serve and hard driven hits, long distance setting, or when the ball is traveling over head.\n\n=== Attack (Spiking) ===\nA hit/flick/chip/drop is used when you are attacking the ball, its an attempt to give your a hard hit to defend so they are unable to get the ball back onto the net. Player usually use a combination of wrist snap, arm swing and rotation to deliver certain types of attacks. The main goal of the hitter is to get a \"kill\". A \"kill\" is a term used when ball is hit and bounces off the net, and the opposing team could not dig the ball, resulting in a point.\n\nIn present-day roundnet there are many different ways to attack the ball:\n\n* Hit(spike)<ref>{{Citation|title=HOW TO ROUNDNET: Over the Net Hitting|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyTwNnBr8wA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>: A hard driven hit usually performed with topspin.\n* Flick<ref>{{Citation|title=HOW TO ROUNDNET: Flick of the Wrist|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgRYfBfNSzE|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>: A very low trajectory shot to place the ball where the defender is not. This is a placement shot.\n* Chip: A high and far trajectory shot to place the ball overhead of the defender, being unreachable then landing very far away from the net.\n* Drop: A low trajectory shot placed in front of the defender. This attack is used with minimal amounts of force.\n\n=== Body block ===\nA body block is a common tactic for defence. Where the player defending a hard driven shot, gets hit with ball, passing the ball up to his partner for a set. Body blocks can also be used to block the ball back onto the net, this is referred to a \"God-(hand, body, knee, or block ect)\"<ref>{{Citation|title=HOW TO ROUNDNET: Body Defense|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSb0bdah1o|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>. A \"God-block\" is when you use any part of your body for example your hand, to deflect the ball back onto the net in one touch usually resulting in a \"kill\", in this case it would be called a \"God-hand\".<br /><br />\n\n== Other names for roundnet ==\n\n* Revol (Used for a short period of time in 2015)\n* Trivolle - used in Europe in 2016-2017\n* Spikeball\u2122 - the brand name of the most popular equipment provider for roundnet (1989-1995, 2008\u2013present)\n* Rashball - popular brand name for roundnet equipment in Europe, especially Germany (2018-present)\n* Slammo\u2122 - Another popular brand name for roundnet equipment\n* Strike 360 - Another popular brand name for roundnet equipment in [[Argentina]] [[Brazil]]\n* Bounceball - Another popular brand name for roundnet equipment in [[Brazil]]\n* Jumbee - popular brand name for roundnet equipment in France\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Shark Tank}}\n\n[[Category:Volleyball variations]]\n[[Category:Games and sports introduced in 1989]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Ball sport with racket and net}}\n\n{{Infobox sport\n| name = Roundnet\n| image = Spiking_a_spikeball.jpg\n| imagesize = 250\n| union = Spikeball Roundnet Association\n| nickname =\n| registered =\n| clubs = Multiple\n| region = Worldwide\n| contact = No\n| team = Doubles (2v2)\n| mgender = Yes, Co-ed tournaments\n| type = Outdoor or indoor\n| category = [[Racket sport]]\n| equipment = [[Ball]], [[Net sport|Net]]\n| venue = Roundnet court\n}}\n\n'''Roundnet''' is a [[net sport]] inspired primarily by concepts from [[volleyball]].

Also an example of how the teams are set up.|alt=]]\n\n=== Setup ===\nMaterials needed for roundnet include a trampoline-like net, and a small ball with a 12-inch circumference. Players line up in a square around the net with their partner to one side, and a member of the opposing team on the other. Each partner is ninety degrees away from the next player.

During the serve, all players who are not receiving the serve have to line up in their designated positions outside of 6 feet from their section of the rim. The returner can stand wherever they want prior to the serve.\n\nOnce the ball is served, all players on both teams can move wherever they may like. After the ball is served, the possession is assumed by the returning team. Once the ball is hit and returned by the non-serving team and hits the net, the possession is flipped. This continues throughout the point, as possession changes whenever the ball hits the net. During each possession, teams have three hits but do not have to use all of their hits.\n\nTo account for harsh sunlight, wind, or any other condition outside of the game; players will rotate serving positions ninety degrees every five points. Only a maximum of 3 touches are permitted.\n\n=== Serving ===\nThe first serve starts the game, and the setup is dictated by the first receiver. The server then stands directly across from the receiver, and only the designated receiver may receive the serve. To serve, the server must throw the ball at least 4 inches away from the release point to begin the serve. The ball is not allowed to be interfered with during the serve. For each point, the server is allowed two serves to complete a legal serve. If they catch, swing at and miss, or drop the tossed ball, it results in a service fault. Servers must be behind the six-foot line away from the net to be eligible for the play. The server cannot lean over the line in order to get closer to the net, and their feet and entire body must be behind the line until the ball is contacted. The server is allowed to take a pivot step, but cannot move further than a pivot. The server can hit the ball at any speed and direction including drop shots. For the serve to be eligible, the ball must not go any higher than the receiver's raised hand. If the ball does this, the receivers must call fault before a second touch occurs or the ball hits the ground. The serving team will have one more try to serve it correctly, or they lose the point. When serving, if the ball hits what is known as a \"pocket\" (the area of the net that is right next to the rim) then the receiving team can call a fault and the server can attempt another serve. If a fault is not called, then the play continues. If two faults occur back to back, the receiving team is awarded the point and possession switches sides. If the serving team wins the point, the server must switch places with their teammate to serve to the other receiver. If the receiving team wins the point, they get to serve the next point.\n\n=== Contacting the ball ===\nRules and regulations exist when the ball is in play. When a team has possession, they must alternate touches, so no double hits happen. The ball must be hit; it cannot be lifted, caught or thrown. Players must use one hand to hit the ball; two-hand hits result in an [[infraction]] and loss of point. Any part of the body may be used to hit the ball. However, if the ball hits any part of the body (even if not the hands), then it may not be hit a second time. In other words, you cannot hit the ball twice in a row no matter what part of the body the ball touches, including if the ball touches elsewhere than the hands. If the ball hits the ground or the rim at any point during the rally, the play ends and a point is given to the other team. If the teams could not determine whether the ball hit the rim or a pocket, the play is replayed. When the ball hits the net, it must clear the rim for the play to be continued. If the ball hits the net again, a double bounce is called and point given to the assuming receiving team. If during a rally the ball hits the pocket, the rally continues. Pockets are only a fault during serves. If the ball makes contact with the net and then proceeds to roll up into the rim, this is known as a \"roll-up\". If this occurs during a serve, the receiving team may call a fault and the serve is tried again. If a roll-up occurs during a rally, it is treated as a pocket, and the rally continues.\n\nInfractions exist even if a team does not have assumed possession, these are called hinders.

If a player hits a shot that hits off the net and hits either themselves or their teammate, they lose the point. If a player makes contact with the set, it results in the loss of the point.

When the server tosses the ball and hits the ball with side spin and top spin, making the ball bounce off the net wider than expected by the receiver. When this serve is placed on the net with tons of power and spin it can be extremely hard for the receiver to get a touch. This serve can be used in most stances, may be more difficult for certain stances.\n\n=== Pass/Dig/Set ===\nA pass or a dig is used to properly receive the opponents serve or any type of hit. To properly handle the serve or hit, you not only have to prevent it from hitting the ground, you also want to give your partner a nice pass to give you a nice set.\n\nThere are two different techniques used to pass the ball, they can be used in different circumstances:\n\n* Under hand pass<ref>{{Citation|title=HOW TO ROUNDNET: The Perfect Underhand Set|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XJC6yzLCZI|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>: When you make a platform with your hand for the ball to bounce off the palm of your hand. Most commonly used for setting your partner.\n* Over head pass<ref>{{Citation|title=HOW TO ROUNDNET: Overhead & Deep Gets/Sets|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idydjh393ds|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>: Essentially the same contact with the under hand pass, but pushing the ball over head. Most commonly used when receiving the serve and hard driven hits, long distance setting, or when the ball is traveling over head.\n\n=== Attack (Spiking) ===\nA hit/flick/chip/drop is used when you are attacking the ball, its an attempt to give your a hard hit to defend so they are unable to get the ball back onto the net. Player usually use a combination of wrist snap, arm swing and rotation to deliver certain types of attacks. The main goal of the hitter is to get a \"kill\". A \"kill\" is a term used when ball is hit and bounces off the net, and the opposing team could not dig the ball, resulting in a point.\n\nIn present-day roundnet there are many different ways to attack the ball:\n\n* Hit(spike)<ref>{{Citation|title=HOW TO ROUNDNET: Over the Net Hitting|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyTwNnBr8wA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>: A hard driven hit usually performed with topspin.\n* Flick<ref>{{Citation|title=HOW TO ROUNDNET: Flick of the Wrist|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgRYfBfNSzE|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>: A very low trajectory shot to place the ball where the defender is not, this is a placement shot.\n* Chip: A high and far trajectory shot to place the ball overhead of the defender, being unreachable then landing very far away from the net.\n* Drop: A low trajectory shot placed in front of the defender. This attack is used with minimal amounts of force.\n\n=== Body block ===\nA body block is a common tactic for defence. Where the player defending a hard driven shot, gets hit with ball, passing the ball up to his partner for a set. Body blocks can also be used to block the ball back onto the net, this is referred to a \"God-(hand, body, knee, or block ect)\"<ref>{{Citation|title=HOW TO ROUNDNET: Body Defense|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSb0bdah1o|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>. A \"God-block\" is when you use any part of your body for example your hand, to deflect the ball back onto the net in one touch usually resulting in a \"kill\", in this case it would be called a \"God-hand\".<br /><br />\n\n== Other names for roundnet ==\n\n* Revol (Used for a short period of time in 2015)\n* Trivolle - used in Europe in 2016-2017\n* Spikeball\u2122 - the brand name of the most popular equipment provider for roundnet (1989-1995, 2008\u2013present)\n* Rashball - popular brand name for roundnet equipment in Europe, especially Germany (2018-present)\n* Slammo\u2122 - Another popular brand name for roundnet equipment\n* Strike 360 - Another popular brand name for roundnet equipment in [[Argentina]] [[Brazil]]\n* Bounceball - Another popular brand name for roundnet equipment in [[Brazil]]\n* Jumbee - popular brand name for roundnet equipment in France\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Shark Tank}}\n\n[[Category:Volleyball variations]]\n[[Category:Games and sports introduced in 1989]]\n", "name_user": "Canadian Spiker13", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundnet"}
