[https://www.biblegateway.com/resources/ivp-nt/Parable-Forgiving-Father Parable of the Forgiving Father (15:11-32)] - The IVP New Testament Commentary Series</ref> is one of the [[parables of Jesus]] in [[the Bible]] and appears in {{bibleverse|Luke|15:11\u201332|NIV}}. Jesus shares it with his disciples, the Pharisees and others.\n\nIn the story, a father has two sons. The younger son asks the father for his inheritance, and the father grants his son's request. However, the younger son is prodigal (i.e., wasteful and extravagant) and squanders his fortune, eventually becoming destitute. The younger son is forced to return home empty-handed and intends to beg his father to accept him back as a servant. To the son's surprise, he is not scorned by his father but is welcomed back with celebration and welcoming party. Envious, the older son refuses to participate in the festivities. The father tells the older son \"you are ever with me, and all that I have is yours, but thy younger brother was lost and now he is found\".\n\nIt is the thirdd and final part of a cycle on redemption, following the [[Parable of the Lost Sheep]] and the [[Parable of the Lost Coin]]. In [[Revised Common Lectionary]] and [[Roman Rite]] Catholic [[Lectionary]], this parable is read on the fourth Sunday of [[Lent]] (in [[Lectionary#Three year cycle|Year C]]);<ref>{{cite web |work= TextWeek.com |title= Lent 4C |accessdate= 2013-09-12 |url= http://www.textweek.com/yearc/lentc4.htm }}</ref> in the latter it is also included in the long form of the Gospel on the 24th Sunday of [[Ordinary Time]] in Year C, along with the preceding two parables of the cycle.<ref>{{cite web |work= TextWeek.com |title= Proper 19 (24th Sunday of Ordinary Time) |accessdate= 2016-09-11 |url= http://www.textweek.com/yearc/properc19.htm }}</ref> In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] it is read on the ''[[Sunday of the Prodigal Son]]''.\n\n==Narrative==\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Return of the Prodigal Son (Le retour de l'enfant prodigue) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Tissot]] \u2013 ''The Return of the Prodigal Son'' (Le retour de l'enfant prodigue) \u2013 [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\nThe [[parable]] begins with a man who had two sons, and the younger of them asks his father to give him his share of the estate. The implication is the son could not wait for his father's death for his inheritance, he wanted it immediately. The father agrees and divides his estate between both sons.\n\nUpon receiving his portion of the inheritance, the younger son travels to a distant country and wastes all his money in extravagant living. Immediately thereafter, a [[famine]] strikes the land; he becomes desperately poor and is forced to take work as a [[swineherd]]. (This, too, would have been abhorrent to Jesus' Jewish audience, who considered swine unclean animals.) When he reaches the point of envying the food of the pigs he is watching, he finally comes to his senses:\n\n{{quotation|\"And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.\n\nAnd he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.\"|Luke 15:17\u201320, [[King James Version]]}} This implies the father was hopefully watching for the son's return. \n\nIn most versions of Luke, the son does not even have time to finish his rehearsed speech,<ref>[[William Robertson Nicoll|Nicoll, W. R.]], [https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/15.htm Expositor's Greek Testament] on Luke 15:21, accessed 3 November 2019; some ancient authorities complete verse 21 in line with the son's prepared statement</ref> as the father calls for his servants to dress him in a fine robe, a ring, and sandals, and slaughter the \"[[Fatted calf|fattened calf]]\" for a celebratory meal.\n\nThe older son, who was at work in the fields, hears the sound of celebration, and is told about the return of his younger brother. He is not impressed, and becomes angry. He also has a speech for his father:\n\n{{quotation|\"And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.\"|Luke 15:29\u201330, [[King James Version]]}}\n\nThe parable concludes with the father explaining that because the younger son had returned, in a sense, from the dead, celebration was necessary:\n\n{{quotation|\"It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.\"|Luke 15:32, [[King James Version]]}}\n\n==Context and interpretation==\n[[File:De_verloren_zoon,_Peter_Paul_Rubens,_(1618),_Koninklijk_Museum_voor_Schone_Kunsten_Antwerpen,_781.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Prodigal Son (painting, Rubens)|The Prodigal Son]]'', a 1618 painting by Rubens of the son as a [[swineherd]].]]\n[[File:Sebald Beham Der verlorene Sohn h\u00fctet seine Schweine.jpg|thumb|Engraving of the Prodigal Son as a swineherd by [[Hans Sebald Beham]], 1538.]]\n\nThe opening, \"A man had two sons\" is a storyteller's trope and would immediately bring to mind [[Cain and Abel]], [[Ishmael]] and [[Isaac]], and [[Esau]] and [[Jacob]].

[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] made a famous [[engraving]] of the Prodigal Son amongst the pigs (1496), a popular subject in the [[Northern Renaissance]]. [[Rembrandt]] depicted several scenes from the parable, especially the final episode, which he etched, drew, or painted on several occasions during his career.<ref>Roland E. Fleischer and Susan C.

[[The Osmonds]] present a version of the parable in their 1973 hit song \"[[Let Me In (The Osmonds song)|Let Me In]],\" from their Mormon concept album ''[[The Plan (The Osmonds album)|The Plan]]''. The British heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]] recorded a song titled \"Prodigal Son\", based on the parable of the same name, which appeared on their second release, ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'', in 1981. U2 recorded a song titled \"The First Time\" on their 1993 album Zooropa. While based on the parable, it presents the idea of an alternate ending to the story. It could be argued that [[Kelly Willard]]'s 1982 song, ''Make Me A Servant'' is based on what the son said to his father when he returned home. \"The Prodigal Son Suite\" from the album ''[[The Prodigal Son (Keith Green album)|The Prodigal Son]]'' is one of the first posthumous releases by the late piano player and gospel singer [[Keith Green]] in 1983. Another artist in the Christian music field during that era, [[Benny Hester]], would record a song titled \"When God Ran\" based on the parable in 1985.\n\nDetroit musician, [[Kid Rock]], also recorded a song titled \"Prodigal Son\", which appeared on his second album ''[[The Polyfuze Method]]'', in 1993. Kid Rock later re-recorded the track for his 2000 album ''[[The History of Rock]]''. The Christian Rock trio [[BarlowGirl]] recorded the song \"She Walked Away\", influenced by the parable,<ref>[http://www.newreleasetuesday.com/albumdetail.php?album_id=253&sortflag=2&page=1 BarlowGirl by BarlowGirl CD review] at NewReleaseTuesday.com</ref> as part of their 2004 [[BarlowGirl (album)|self-titled album]]. \"Indie\" rock band [[Two Gallants (band)|Two Gallants]] covered the parable in the song \"The Prodigal Son\" on their 2006 album ''[[What the Toll Tells]]''.

The band [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]] recorded a song titled \"Who Cares?\", which appeared on the album ''[[III Sides to Every Story]]'', which is influenced by this parable.\nBrantley Gilbert released a song called \"Modern Day Prodigal Son\". British Reggae band [[Steel Pulse]] recorded a song titled \"Prodigal Son\" on their debut album [[Handsworth Revolution]], recreating the Biblical story as a Rastafarian parable. The Post-Hardcore band \"Gideon\" released a song called \"Prodigal Son\", which appeared on their second album ''Milestone''. Christian rock outfit The Chinese Express opened and closed their 2006 release with a two part telling of the parable with songs titled \"Said the son to the Father\" and \"Said the Father to the Son\". Post-hardcore band \"Jamie's Elsewhere\" also released a song titled \"Prodigal Son\". The Los Angeles rap group [[House of Pain]] references the parable in one of the verses of their song, \"[[Jump Around]]\". English indie rock band [[alt-J]] references the parable in the first verse of their song \"Left Hand Free\". On their 2015 album ''Something Different'', the Christian band [[Sidewalk Prophets]] included an uplifting song titled \"Prodigal\" with lyrics that are directed towards the Prodigal Son from the parable, or any person who is or has felt like they are in a similar situation.\n\nIn 2006 Country artist [[Dierks Bentley]] wrote a song for his album ''[[Long Trip Alone]]'' entitled \"The Prodigal Son's Prayer\". The song is based on the son's prospective of coming home after he's ruined himself in the world.\nGospel artists [[Tribute Quartet]] released \"When the Prodigal Comes Home\" in 2016.\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:L Spada Regreso del hijo pr\u00f3digo Museo del Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|The Return of the Prodigal Son ([[Leonello Spada]], [[Louvre]], [[Paris]])]]\nAnother literary tribute to this parable is Dutch theologian [[Henri Nouwen]]'s 1992 book, ''The Return of the Prodigal Son: A Story of Homecoming'', in which he describes his own spiritual journey infused with understanding based on an encounter with Rembrandt's painting of the return of the Prodigal and deals with three personages: the younger, prodigal son; the [[self-righteous]], resentful older son; and the [[compassion]]ate father \u2013 all of whom the author identifies with personally.<ref>Deirdre LaNoue, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OS2u8ZoktZYC&pg=PA45 The Spiritual Legacy of Henri Nouwen]'', Continuum, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8264-1283-1}}, p. 45.</ref> An earlier work with similarities to the parable is \"[[Le retour de l'enfant prodigue]]\" (\"The Return of the Prodigal Son\"), a short story by [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Martin |last=Turnell |title= Andr\u00e9 Gide and the Disintegration of the Protestant Cell |journal=Yale French Studies |publisher=Yale University Press |issue=7 |pages=21\u201331}}</ref>\n\n[[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote a poem<ref>{{cite web|url=http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/rudyard_kipling/poems/14457 |title=The Prodigal Son |publisher=Famouspoetsandpoems.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}</ref> giving an interpretation of the younger brother's perspective.<ref>Andrew Keith Malcolm Adam, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GqkPR4EehX0C&pg=PA202 Postmodern Interpretations of the Bible: A reader]'', Chalice Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8272-2970-4}}, pp. 202\u2013203.</ref>\n\nThe Parable of the Prodigal Son is also a recurring theme in the works of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], who interpreted the parable in a different way to the conventional reading. His version of the parable was not so concerned with redemption and the [[forgiveness]] of family; the love of the family, and human love in general, was seen as less worthy than unreciprocated love, which is the purest form of love. In loving the family less, the Son can love God more, even if this love is not returned.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRCJwgmfhzYC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=rilke+the+prodigal+son&source=bl&ots=E1O5UwL85Z&sig=wjqKit4PuE0v0awq2iIii7_BJwA&hl=en&ei=vUFETbH8EqKqhAeSnsnUAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&sqi=2&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Books.google.co.uk |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcNpVv9wpPsC&pg=PA196&lpg=PA196&dq=rilke+the+prodigal+son&source=bl&ots=MYt525JcKd&sig=X5-83oebnWAlBT5HU0OuAJRmCpU&hl=en&ei=vUFETbH8EqKqhAeSnsnUAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&sqi=2&ved=0CEoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=rilke%20the%20prodigal%20son&f=false |title=Books.google.co.uk |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}</ref>\n\nThe theme of the Prodigal Son plays a major role in Anne Tyler's novel ''[[A Spool of Blue Thread]]''.<ref name=\"Sinkler, R.

Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 4.2 (1981), p. 91</ref> However, an influence of the biblical story on the Lotus sutra is regarded as unlikely given the early dating of the stratum of the sutra containing the Buddhist parable.<ref name=\"lai\"/> In spite of their similarities, both parables continue differently after the two meet for the first time at the son's return. In the biblical story, there is an immediate reunion of the two. In contrast, in the Lotus sutra, the poor son does not recognize the rich man as his father. When the father sends out some attendants to welcome the son, the son panics, fearing some kind of retribution. The father then lets the son leave without telling him of their kinship. However, he gradually draws the son closer to him by employing him in successively higher positions, only to tell him of their kinship in the end.<ref name=\"sutra\"/> In the Buddhist parable, the father symbolises the Buddha, and the son symbolises any human being. Their kinship symbolises that any being has [[Buddha nature]].

[https://www.biblegateway.com/resources/ivp-nt/Parable-Forgiving-Father Parable of the Forgiving Father (15:11-32)] - The IVP New Testament Commentary Series</ref> is one of the [[parables of Jesus]] in [[the Bible]] and appears in {{bibleverse|Luke|15:11\u201332|NIV}}. Jesus shares it with his disciples, the Pharisees and others.\n\nIn the story, a father has two sons. The younger son asks the father for his inheritance, and the father grants his son's request. However, the younger son is prodigal (i.e., wasteful and extravagant) and squanders his fortune, eventually becoming destitute. The younger son is forced to return home empty-handed and intends to beg his father to accept him back as a servant. To the son's surprise, he is not scorned by his father but is welcomed back with celebration and welcoming party. Envious, the older son refuses to participate in the festivities. The father tells the older son \"you are ever with me, and all that I have is yours, but thy younger brother was lost and now he is found\".\n\nIt is the third and final part of a cycle on redemption, following the [[Parable of the Lost Sheep]] and the [[Parable of the Lost Coin]]. In [[Revised Common Lectionary]] and [[Roman Rite]] Catholic [[Lectionary]], this parable is read on the fourth Sunday of [[Lent]] (in [[Lectionary#Three year cycle|Year C]]);<ref>{{cite web |work= TextWeek.com |title= Lent 4C |accessdate= 2013-09-12 |url= http://www.textweek.com/yearc/lentc4.htm }}</ref> in the latter it is also included in the long form of the Gospel on the 24th Sunday of [[Ordinary Time]] in Year C, along with the preceding two parables of the cycle.<ref>{{cite web |work= TextWeek.com |title= Proper 19 (24th Sunday of Ordinary Time) |accessdate= 2016-09-11 |url= http://www.textweek.com/yearc/properc19.htm }}</ref> In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] it is read on the ''[[Sunday of the Prodigal Son]]''.\n\n==Narrative==\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Return of the Prodigal Son (Le retour de l'enfant prodigue) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Tissot]] \u2013 ''The Return of the Prodigal Son'' (Le retour de l'enfant prodigue) \u2013 [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\nThe [[parable]] begins with a man who had two sons, and the younger of them asks his father to give him his share of the estate. The implication is the son could not wait for his father's death for his inheritance, he wanted it immediately. The father agrees and divides his estate between both sons.\n\nUpon receiving his portion of the inheritance, the younger son travels to a distant country and wastes all his money in extravagant living. Immediately thereafter, a [[famine]] strikes the land; he becomes desperately poor and is forced to take work as a [[swineherd]]. (This, too, would have been abhorrent to Jesus' Jewish audience, who considered swine unclean animals.) When he reaches the point of envying the food of the pigs he is watching, he finally comes to his senses:\n\n{{quotation|\"And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.\n\nAnd he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.\"|Luke 15:17\u201320, [[King James Version]]}} This implies the father was hopefully watching for the son's return. \n\nIn most versions of Luke, the son does not even have time to finish his rehearsed speech,<ref>[[William Robertson Nicoll|Nicoll, W. R.]], [https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/15.htm Expositor's Greek Testament] on Luke 15:21, accessed 3 November 2019; some ancient authorities complete verse 21 in line with the son's prepared statement</ref> as the father calls for his servants to dress him in a fine robe, a ring, and sandals, and slaughter the \"[[Fatted calf|fattened calf]]\" for a celebratory meal.\n\nThe older son, who was at work in the fields, hears the sound of celebration, and is told about the return of his younger brother. He is not impressed, and becomes angry. He also has a speech for his father:\n\n{{quotation|\"And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.\"|Luke 15:29\u201330, [[King James Version]]}}\n\nThe parable concludes with the father explaining that because the younger son had returned, in a sense, from the dead, celebration was necessary:\n\n{{quotation|\"It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.\"|Luke 15:32, [[King James Version]]}}\n\n==Context and interpretation==\n[[File:De_verloren_zoon,_Peter_Paul_Rubens,_(1618),_Koninklijk_Museum_voor_Schone_Kunsten_Antwerpen,_781.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Prodigal Son (painting, Rubens)|The Prodigal Son]]'', a 1618 painting by Rubens of the son as a [[swineherd]].]]\n[[File:Sebald Beham Der verlorene Sohn h\u00fctet seine Schweine.jpg|thumb|Engraving of the Prodigal Son as a swineherd by [[Hans Sebald Beham]], 1538.]]\n\nThe opening, \"A man had two sons\" is a storyteller's trope and would immediately bring to mind [[Cain and Abel]], [[Ishmael]] and [[Isaac]], and [[Esau]] and [[Jacob]].

[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] made a famous [[engraving]] of the Prodigal Son amongst the pigs (1496), a popular subject in the [[Northern Renaissance]].

[[The Osmonds]] present a version of the parable in their 1973 hit song \"[[Let Me In (The Osmonds song)|Let Me In]],\" from their Mormon concept album ''[[The Plan (The Osmonds album)|The Plan]]''. The British heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]] recorded a song titled \"Prodigal Son\", based on the parable of the same name, which appeared on their second release, ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'', in 1981. U2 recorded a song titled \"The First Time\" on their 1993 album Zooropa. While based on the parable, it presents the idea of an alternate ending to the story. It could be argued that [[Kelly Willard]]'s 1982 song, ''Make Me A Servant'' is based on what the son said to his father when he returned home. \"The Prodigal Son Suite\" from the album ''[[The Prodigal Son (Keith Green album)|The Prodigal Son]]'' is one of the first posthumous releases by the late piano player and gospel singer [[Keith Green]] in 1983. Another artist in the Christian music field during that era, [[Benny Hester]], would record a song titled \"When God Ran\" based on the parable in 1985.\n\nDetroit musician, [[Kid Rock]], also recorded a song titled \"Prodigal Son\", which appeared on his second album ''[[The Polyfuze Method]]'', in 1993. Kid Rock later re-recorded the track for his 2000 album ''[[The History of Rock]]''. The Christian Rock trio [[BarlowGirl]] recorded the song \"She Walked Away\", influenced by the parable,<ref>[http://www.newreleasetuesday.com/albumdetail.php?album_id=253&sortflag=2&page=1 BarlowGirl by BarlowGirl CD review] at NewReleaseTuesday.com</ref> as part of their 2004 [[BarlowGirl (album)|self-titled album]]. \"Indie\" rock band [[Two Gallants (band)|Two Gallants]] covered the parable in the song \"The Prodigal Son\" on their 2006 album ''[[What the Toll Tells]]''.

The band [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]] recorded a song titled \"Who Cares?\", which appeared on the album ''[[III Sides to Every Story]]'', which is influenced by this parable.\nBrantley Gilbert released a song called \"Modern Day Prodigal Son\". British Reggae band [[Steel Pulse]] recorded a song titled \"Prodigal Son\" on their debut album [[Handsworth Revolution]], recreating the Biblical story as a Rastafarian parable. The Post-Hardcore band \"Gideon\" released a song called \"Prodigal Son\", which appeared on their second album ''Milestone''. Christian rock outfit The Chinese Express opened and closed their 2006 release with a two part telling of the parable with songs titled \"Said the son to the Father\" and \"Said the Father to the Son\". Post-hardcore band \"Jamie's Elsewhere\" also released a song titled \"Prodigal Son\". The Los Angeles rap group [[House of Pain]] references the parable in one of the verses of their song, \"[[Jump Around]]\". English indie rock band [[alt-J]] references the parable in the first verse of their song \"Left Hand Free\". On their 2015 album ''Something Different'', the Christian band [[Sidewalk Prophets]] included an uplifting song titled \"Prodigal\" with lyrics that are directed towards the Prodigal Son from the parable, or any person who is or has felt like they are in a similar situation.\n\nIn 2006 Country artist [[Dierks Bentley]] wrote a song for his album ''[[Long Trip Alone]]'' entitled \"The Prodigal Son's Prayer\".

In the biblical story, there is an immediate reunion of the two. In contrast, in the Lotus sutra, the poor son does not recognize the rich man as his father. When the father sends out some attendants to welcome the son, the son panics, fearing some kind of retribution. The father then lets the son leave without telling him of their kinship. However, he gradually draws the son closer to him by employing him in successively higher positions, only to tell him of their kinship in the end.<ref name=\"sutra\"/> In the Buddhist parable, the father symbolises the Buddha, and the son symbolises any human being. Their kinship symbolises that any being has [[Buddha nature]]. The concealment of the kinship of the father to his son is regarded as a skillful means (Sanskrit:[[Upaya|up\u0101ya]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Opening the Heart of the Cosmos|last=Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh|first=Th\u00edch|pages=37\u201341|isbn=9781888375336|publisher=Parallax Press|year=2003}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ministry of Jesus]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Wiggins, James, 2010.

Elizabeth was raised in what would eventually become (in the years after the [[American Revolution]]) the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].\n\nHer mother, Catherine, died in 1777 when Elizabeth was three years old, possibly due to complications from the birth of her namesake Catherine, who died early the following year. Elizabeth's father then married Charlotte Amelia Barclay, a member of the Jacobus James [[Roosevelt family]],<ref name=shrine/> to provide a mother for his two surviving daughters. The new Mrs. Bayley participated in her church's social ministry, and often took young Elizabeth with her on charitable rounds, as she visited the poor in their homes to distribute food and needed items.\n\n[[File:Appletons' Seton Elizabeth Ann.jpg|thumb|210px|Elizabeth Ann Seton, from ''Appleton's Cyclopaedia'']]\n\nThe couple had five children, but the marriage ended in separation. During the breakup, their stepmother rejected Elizabeth and her older sister. Their father then traveled to [[London]] for further medical studies, so the sisters lived temporarily in New Rochelle with their paternal uncle, William Bayley, and his wife, Sarah Pell Bayley. Elizabeth endured a time of darkness, grieving the absence of a second mother, as she later reflected in her journals. In these journals, Elizabeth showed her love for nature, poetry, and music, especially the piano. Other entries expressed her religious aspirations, and favorite passages from her reading showing her introspection and natural bent toward contemplation.

A [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]], the senior William Seton was the last royal [[notary public|public notary]] for the city and province of New York. He brought his sons William (Elizabeth's husband) and James into the import-export mercantile firm, the William Seton Company, which became Seton, Maitland and Company in 1793. The younger William had visited important [[counting house]]s in Europe in 1788, was a friend of Filippo Filicchi (a renowned merchant in [[Livorno|Leghorn]], Italy, with whom his firm traded), and brought the first [[Stradivarius]] violin to America.<ref name=Barkley/>\n\nShortly after they married, Elizabeth and William moved into a fashionable residence on Wall Street. Socially prominent in New York society, the Setons belonged to [[Trinity Episcopal Church, New York|Trinity Episcopal Church]], near Broadway and Wall Streets. A devout communicant, Elizabeth took the Rev. [[John Henry Hobart]] (later bishop) as her spiritual director. Along with her sister-in-law Rebecca Mary Seton (1780\u20131804) (her soul-friend and dearest confidante), Elizabeth continued her former stepmother's social ministry\u2014nursing the sick and dying among family, friends, and needy neighbors. Influenced by her father she became a charter member of The Society for the Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children (1797) and also served as the organization's treasurer.<ref name=archb>{{cite web |url=https://www.archbalt.org/st-elizabeth-ann-seton/ |title=St. Elizabeth Ann Seton |publisher=Archdiocese of Baltimore |first=Betty Ann |last=McNeil |date=September 27, 2009 |accessdate=January 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhen the elder William Seton died, the Seton family fortunes waned during the volatile economic climate preceding the [[War of 1812]]. The couple took in William's six younger siblings, ages seven to seventeen, in addition to their own five children: Anna Maria (Annina) (1795\u20131812), William II (1796\u20131868), Richard Seton (1798\u20131823), [[Catherine Seton|Catherine]] (1800\u20131891) (who was to become the first American to join the [[Sisters of Mercy]]) and Rebecca Mary (1802\u20131816).

Through most of their married life, William Seton suffered from tuberculosis. The stress worsened his illness; his doctors sent him to Italy for the warmer climate, with Elizabeth and their eldest daughter as his companions. Upon landing at the port of Leghorn, they were held in [[quarantine]] for a month, for authorities feared they might have brought yellow fever from New York.

A year later, she received the [[sacrament]] of [[Confirmation]] from the [[Archdiocese of Baltimore|Bishop of Baltimore]], [[the Right Reverend]] [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]], the only Catholic bishop in the nation.\n\nIn order to support herself and her children, Seton had started an [[academy]] for young ladies, as was common for widows of social standing in that period. After news of her conversion to Catholicism spread, however, most parents withdrew their daughters from her tutelage. In 1807, students attending a local Protestant Academy were boarded at her house on Stuyvesant Lane in the Bowery, near St. Mark's Church.<ref>Meehan, Thomas F.

The Sulpicians had taken refuge in the United States from the religious persecution of the [[Reign of Terror]] in France and were in the process of establishing the first Catholic [[seminary]] for the United States, in keeping with the goals of their society. For several years, Dubourg had envisioned a religious school to meet the educational needs of the new nation's small Catholic community.<ref name=archb/>\n\n===Founder===\nAfter living through many difficulties in life, in 1809 Seton accepted the invitation of the Sulpicians and moved to Emmitsburg, Maryland. A year later she established the [[St. Joseph's College and Mother Seton Shrine|Saint Joseph's Academy and Free School]], a school dedicated to the education of Catholic girls. This was possible due to the financial support of Samuel Sutherland Cooper,<ref name=randolph/> a wealthy convert and seminarian at the newly established [[Mount Saint Mary's University]], begun by [[John Dubois]], S.S., and the Sulpicians.\n\nOn July 31, Seton established a religious community in Emmitsburg dedicated to the care of the children of the poor. This was the first congregation of religious sisters to be founded in the United States, and its school was the first free Catholic school in America.

From that point on, she became known as \"Mother Seton\". In 1811, the sisters adopted the rules of the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]], co-founded in France by [[St. Vincent de Paul]] and [[St. Louise de Marillac]].\n\n===Later life and death===\n[[File:Basilica of the National Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton interior 14.jpg|thumb|Mother Seton's tomb in Emmitsburg]]\nThe remainder of Seton's life was spent in leading and developing the new congregation. Seton was described as a charming and cultured lady. Her connections to New York society and the accompanying social pressures to leave the new life she had created for herself did not deter her from embracing her religious vocation and charitable mission. The greatest difficulties she faced were actually internal, stemming from misunderstandings, interpersonal conflicts and the deaths of two daughters, other loved ones, and young sisters in the community.\n\nSeton died on January 4, 1821, at the age of 46. Today, her remains are entombed in the [[National Shrine of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton]] in Emmitsburg, Maryland.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\n[[Image:Elizabeth Ann Seton Sign.JPG|thumb|left|Sign of the New York shrine]]\n[[Image:Seton Raymond cem jeh.JPG|thumb|Statue in [[Saint Raymond's Cemetery, Bronx|St. Raymond's Cemetery]], [[Bronx, New York]]]]\n\nBy 1830, the Sisters were running orphanages and schools as far west as Cincinnati and New Orleans, and had established the first hospital west of the Mississippi in St. Louis.<ref name=emmitsburg/>\n\nIt had been Seton's original intention to join the [[Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul]], but the [[embargo]] of [[France]] due to the [[Napoleonic Wars]] prevented this connection.

Elizabeth was raised in what would eventually become (in the years after the [[American Revolution]]) the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].\n\nHer mother, Catherine, died in 1777 when Elizabeth was three years old, possibly due to complications from the birth of her namesake Catherine, who died early the following year. Elizabeth's father then married Charlotte Amelia Barclay, a member of the Jacobus James [[Roosevelt family]],<ref name=shrine/> to provide a mother for his two surviving daughters. The new Mrs. Bayley participated in her church's social ministry, and often took young Elizabeth with her on charitable rounds, as she visited the poor in their homes to distribute food and needed items.\n\n[[File:Appletons' Seton Elizabeth Ann.jpg|thumb|210px|Elizabeth Ann Seton, from ''Appleton's Cyclopaedia'']]\n\nThe couple had five children, but the marriage ended in separation. During the breakup, their stepmother rejected Elizabeth and her older sister. Their father then traveled to [[London]] for further medical studies, so the sisters lived temporarily in New Rochelle with their paternal uncle, William Bayley, and his wife, Sarah Pell Bayley. Elizabeth endured a time of darkness, grieving the absence of a second mother, as she later reflected in her journals. In these journals, Elizabeth showed her love for nature, poetry, and music, especially the piano. Other entries expressed her religious aspirations, and favorite passages from her reading showing her introspection and natural bent toward contemplation. Elizabeth was fluent in French, a fine musician, and an accomplished horsewoman.<ref name=crystal>{{cite web |url=https://www.elizabethannseton.org/biography-of-st-elizabeth-ann-seton |title=Biography of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton |publisher=St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Roman Catholic Church, Crystal Lake, Illinois |accessdate=January 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and motherhood ===\nOn January 25, 1794, at age 19, Elizabeth married William Magee Seton, aged 25, a wealthy businessman in the [[import]] trade. [[Samuel Provoost]], the first Episcopal [[bishop]] of New York, presided at their wedding.<ref name=ehs>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmitsburg.net/setonshrine/|title=St. Elizabeth Ann Seton|website=www.emmitsburg.net|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref> Her husband's father, William Seton (1746\u20131798), belonged to an impoverished noble Scottish family, and had emigrated to New York in 1758, and became superintendent and part owner of the iron-works of [[Ringwood, New Jersey]]. A [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]], the senior William Seton was the last royal [[notary public|public notary]] for the city and province of New York. He brought his sons William (Elizabeth's husband) and James into the import-export mercantile firm, the William Seton Company, which became Seton, Maitland and Company in 1793. The younger William had visited important [[counting house]]s in Europe in 1788, was a friend of Filippo Filicchi (a renowned merchant in [[Livorno|Leghorn]], Italy, with whom his firm traded), and brought the first [[Stradivarius]] violin to America.<ref name=Barkley/>\n\nShortly after they married, Elizabeth and William moved into a fashionable residence on Wall Street. Socially prominent in New York society, the Setons belonged to [[Trinity Episcopal Church, New York|Trinity Episcopal Church]], near Broadway and Wall Streets. A devout communicant, Elizabeth took the Rev. [[John Henry Hobart]] (later bishop) as her spiritual director. Along with her sister-in-law Rebecca Mary Seton (1780\u20131804) (her soul-friend and dearest confidante), Elizabeth continued her former stepmother's social ministry\u2014nursing the sick and dying among family, friends, and needy neighbors.

The couple took in William's six younger siblings, ages seven to seventeen, in addition to their own five children: Anna Maria (Annina) (1795\u20131812), William II (1796\u20131868), Richard Seton (1798\u20131823), [[Catherine Seton|Catherine]] (1800\u20131891) (who was to become the first American to join the [[Sisters of Mercy]]) and Rebecca Mary (1802\u20131816).

The [[United Kingdom]]'s blockade of France and the loss of several of his ships at sea led William Seton into bankruptcy, and the Setons lost their home at 61 Stone Street in lower Manhattan.<ref name=ehs/> The following summer she and the children stayed with her father, who was still the health officer for the Port of New York on Staten Island.<ref name=crystal/> From 1801 to 1803 they lived in a house at 8 State Street, on the site of the present Church of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary (built in 1964). Through most of their married life, William Seton suffered from tuberculosis. The stress worsened his illness; his doctors sent him to Italy for the warmer climate, with Elizabeth and their eldest daughter as his companions. Upon landing at the port of Leghorn, they were held in [[quarantine]] for a month, for authorities feared they might have brought yellow fever from New York. William died on December 27, 1803,<ref name=randolph>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13739a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Elizabeth Ann Seton|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref> and was buried in Italy's [[Old English Cemetery, Livorno|Old English Cemetery]]. Elizabeth and Anna Maria were received by the families of her late husband's Italian business partners, Filippo and Antonio Filicchi, who introduced her to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].\n[[File:Old Saint Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Manhattan, New York.jpg|thumb|left|St. Peter's, Barclay Street, 1785]]\nReturning to New York, the widow Seton was received into the Catholic Church on March 14, 1805, by the Reverend Matthew O'Brien, [[pastor]] of [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, New York|St. Peter's Church]],<ref name=archb/> then the city's only Catholic church. (Anti-Catholic laws had been lifted just a few years before.) A year later, she received the [[sacrament]] of [[Confirmation]] from the [[Archdiocese of Baltimore|Bishop of Baltimore]], [[the Right Reverend]] [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]], the only Catholic bishop in the nation.\n\nIn order to support herself and her children, Seton had started an [[academy]] for young ladies, as was common for widows of social standing in that period. After news of her conversion to Catholicism spread, however, most parents withdrew their daughters from her tutelage. In 1807, students attending a local Protestant Academy were boarded at her house on Stuyvesant Lane in the Bowery, near St. Mark's Church.<ref>Meehan, Thomas F.

The Sulpicians had taken refuge in the United States from the religious persecution of the [[Reign of Terror]] in France and were in the process of establishing the first Catholic [[seminary]] for the United States, in keeping with the goals of their society. For several years, Dubourg had envisioned a religious school to meet the educational needs of the new nation's small Catholic community.<ref name=archb/>\n\n===Founder===\nAfter living through many difficulties in life, in 1809 Seton accepted the invitation of the Sulpicians and moved to Emmitsburg, Maryland. A year later she established the [[St. Joseph's College and Mother Seton Shrine|Saint Joseph's Academy and Free School]], a school dedicated to the education of Catholic girls. This was possible due to the financial support of Samuel Sutherland Cooper,<ref name=randolph/> a wealthy convert and seminarian at the newly established [[Mount Saint Mary's University]], begun by [[John Dubois]], S.S., and the Sulpicians.\n\nOn July 31, Seton established a religious community in Emmitsburg dedicated to the care of the children of the poor. This was the first congregation of religious sisters to be founded in the United States, and its school was the first free Catholic school in America. This modest beginning marked the start of the Catholic parochial school system in the United States.<ref name=emmitsburg>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmitsburg.net/archive_list/articles/history/stories/sisters_of_charity.htm |title=A Short History of the Sisters of Charity |publisher=Emmitsburg Area Historical Society |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref> The congregation was initially called the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph's. From that point on, she became known as \"Mother Seton\". In 1811, the sisters adopted the rules of the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]], co-founded in France by [[St. Vincent de Paul]] and [[St. Louise de Marillac]].\n\n===Later life and death===\n[[File:Basilica of the National Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton interior 14.jpg|thumb|Mother Seton's tomb in Emmitsburg]]\nThe remainder of Seton's life was spent in leading and developing the new congregation. Seton was described as a charming and cultured lady. Her connections to New York society and the accompanying social pressures to leave the new life she had created for herself did not deter her from embracing her religious vocation and charitable mission. The greatest difficulties she faced were actually internal, stemming from misunderstandings, interpersonal conflicts and the deaths of two daughters, other loved ones, and young sisters in the community.\n\nSeton died on January 4, 1821, at the age of 46. Today, her remains are entombed in the [[National Shrine of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton]] in Emmitsburg, Maryland.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\n[[Image:Elizabeth Ann Seton Sign.JPG|thumb|left|Sign of the New York shrine]]\n[[Image:Seton Raymond cem jeh.JPG|thumb|Statue in [[Saint Raymond's Cemetery, Bronx|St. Raymond's Cemetery]], [[Bronx, New York]]]]\n\nBy 1830, the Sisters were running orphanages and schools as far west as Cincinnati and New Orleans, and had established the first hospital west of the Mississippi in St. Louis.<ref name=emmitsburg/>\n\nIt had been Seton's original intention to join the [[Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul]], but the [[embargo]] of [[France]] due to the [[Napoleonic Wars]] prevented this connection.

They have been a feature of many cultures, including Catholic and Orthodox Europe and Shinto Japan.\n\n== The origins of wayside shrines ==\nWayside shrines were often erected to honor the memory of the victim of an accident, which explains their prevalence near roads and paths; in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], for example, they often stand at crossroads. Some commemorate a specific incident near the place; either a death in an accident or escape from harm. Other icons commemorate the victims of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. The very grand medieval English [[Eleanor cross]]es were erected by her husband to commemorate the nightly resting places of the journey made by the body of Queen [[Eleanor of Castile]] as it returned to London in the 1290s.  Some make it clear by an inscription or notice that a specific dead person is commemorated, but most do not.\n\nWayside shrines were also erected along old pilgrim routes, such as the [[Via Sacra (Wienerwald)|Via Sacra]] that leads from Vienna to [[Mariazell]]. Some mark parish or other boundaries, such as the edge or a landholding, or have a function as convenient markers for travelers to find their way. Shrines and [[Calvary (sculpture)|calvaries]] are furthermore frequently noted on maps and therefore represent important orientation aids. \n\n==Europe==\n[[File:Slovenska bozi muka.jpg|thumb|Wayside shrine [[Ohrady]], [[Slovakia]].]] \n[[File:Cappella angelo custode sul monte trefontane, fondachelli fantina, sicilia.JPG|thumb|upright|Wayside shrine of the [[Guardian Angel]]  in a wood of [[Fondachelli-Fantina]], Sicily]]\nThe pre-Christian cultures of Europe had similar shrines of various types; many [[runestone]]s may have fallen into this category, though they are often in the nature of a memorial to a dead person.  Few Christian shrines survive in predominantly Protestant countries, but they remain common in many parts of Catholic and Orthodox Europe, often being repaired or replaced as they fall into disrepair, and relocated as roads are moved or widened.  The most common subjects are a plain cross or a [[crucifix]], or an image of the [[Virgin Mary]], but saints or other scenes may also be shown.  The surviving large stone [[high cross]]es of [[Celtic Christianity]], and the related stone [[Anglo-Saxon]] crosses (mostly damaged or destroyed after the [[Protestant Reformation]]) are sometimes outside churches, but often not, and these may have functioned as [[preaching cross]]es, or in some cases just been wayside shrines.  The [[Calvary (sculpture)|''calvaires'']] of [[Brittany]] in France, are especially large stone shrines showing the [[Crucifixion]], but these are typically in villages.\n\nIn Greece they may be called ''kandilakia'' (Greek: \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1) or \u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 (''ikonost\u00e1sio stin akri tu dr\u00f3mu'', literally \"shrine at the roadside\").\n\n== Types of shrines ==\nWayside shrines are found in a variety of styles, ranging from simpler column shrines and ''Sch\u00f6pfl\u00f6ffel'' shrines to more elaborate chapel-shrines. Some have only flat painted surfaces, while other shrines are decorated with reliefs or with religious statues. Some feature a small kneeling platform, so that the faithful may pray in front of the image.  A common wayside shrine seen throughout the Alpine regions of Europe, especially Germany, Austria and northern Italy, is the Alpine style crucifix wayside shrine.  This style often has elaborate wood carvings and usually consists of a crucifix surrounded by a roof and shelter.\n\n=== Column shrines ===\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | footer = Column shrines\n | footer_align = center\n | image1 = Garsdorf Shrine.JPG\n | width1 = 145\n | caption1 = Wooden column shrine in [[Ursensollen|Garsdorf]], [[Bavaria]]\n | image2 = Bo\u017e\u00ed muka - V\u0159esovice.jpg\n | width2 = 137\n | caption2 = Stone column shrine in [[V\u0159esovice (Hodon\u00edn District)|V\u0159esovice]], [[Czech Republic]]\n | image3 = Shrine - Mali Lipoglav Slovenia.JPG\n | width3 = 121\n | caption3 = Roofed column shrine in [[Mali Lipoglav]], Slovenia\n }}\nA column shrine<ref>Leary, James P. 1998.

It is given by the following formula: BMI equals a person's weight (mass) in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in metres. The units therefore are kg/m<sup>2</sup> but BMI measures are typically used and written without units.\n\n:BMI provides a significantly more accurate representation of body fat content than simply measuring a person's weight. It is only moderately correlated with both body fat percentage and body fat mass ([[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|R<sup>2</sup>]] of 0.68).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Use of relative weight and Body Mass Index for the determination of adiposity |last1=Gray |first1=D.

There has been an acceptance in recent years that abdominal fat and weight around the abdomen constitute a greater health risk.<ref>{{cite web |last=Craver |first=R. |date=10 September 2008 |url=http://www.wakehealth.edu/Gerontology-and-Geriatrics/Location,-not-volume,-of-fat-found-to-be-key.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515223636/http://www.wakehealth.edu/Gerontology-and-Geriatrics/Location,-not-volume,-of-fat-found-to-be-key.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 May 2013 |title=Location, not volume, of fat found to be key |publisher=Journalnow.com |accessdate=2008-10-09 }}</ref>\n*[[weighing scale|Simple weighing]]\n:A person's weight is measured and compared to an estimated ideal weight. This is the easiest and most common method, but by far the least accurate, as it only measures one quantity (weight) and often does not take into account many factors such as height, [[body type]], and relative amount of [[muscle]] mass.\n*Skinfold [[caliper]]s or \"pinch test\"\n:The skin at several specific points on the body is pinched and the thickness of the resulting fold is measured.  This measures the thickness of the layers of fat located under the skin, from which a general measurement of total amount of fat in the body is calculated.  This method can be reasonably accurate for many people, but it assumes particular fat distribution patterns over the body\u2014which may not apply to all individuals, and does not account for fat deposits not directly under the skin.  Also, as the measurement and analysis generally involves a high degree of practice and interpretation, an accurate result requires that a professional perform it. It cannot generally be done by patients themselves.\n*[[Bioelectrical impedance analysis]]\n:A small electric current is passed through the body to measure its [[electrical resistance]]. As fat and muscle conduct electricity differently, this method can provide a direct measurement of the body fat percentage, in relation to muscle mass. In the past, this technique could only be performed reliably by trained professionals with specialized equipment, but it is now possible to buy home testing kits that let people do this themselves with a minimum of training.  Despite the improved simplicity of this process over the years, however, a number of factors can affect the results, including [[Fluid replacement|hydration]] and [[body temperature]], so it still needs some care when taking the test to ensure that the results are accurate.\n*[[hydrostatic equilibrium|Hydrostatic]] weighing\n:Considered one of the more accurate methods of measuring body fat, this technique involves complete submersion of a person in water, with special equipment to measure the person's weight while submerged. This weight is then compared with \"dry weight\" as recorded outside the water to determine overall body density. As fat is less dense than muscle, careful application of this technique can provide a reasonably close estimate of fat content in the body.  This technique does, however, require expensive specialized equipment and trained professionals to administer it properly.\n*[[Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DEXA)\n:Originally developed to measure bone density, DEXA imaging is also used to precisely determine body fat content by using the density of various body tissues to identify which portions of the body are fat. This test is generally considered very accurate, but requires a great deal of expensive medical equipment and trained professionals to perform.\n\nThe most common method for discussing this subject and the one used primarily by researchers and advisory institutions is BMI. Definitions of what is considered overweight vary by ethnicity. The current definition proposed by the US [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) designates whites, Hispanics and blacks with a BMI of 25 or more as overweight. For Asians, overweight is a BMI between 23 and 29.9 and obesity for all groups is a BMI of 30 or more.\n\nBMI, however, does not account extremes of muscle mass, some rare [[genetics|genetic]] factors, the very young, and a few other individual variations.  Thus it is possible for an individuals with a BMI of less than 25 to have excess body fat, while others may have a BMI that is significantly higher without falling into this category.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Dympna |last1=Gallagher |first2=S.

It is given by the following formula: BMI equals a person's weight (mass) in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in metres. The units therefore are kg/m<sup>2</sup> but BMI measures are typically used and written without units.\n\n:BMI provides a significantly more accurate representation of body fat content than simply measuring a person's weight. It is only moderately correlated with both body fat percentage and body fat mass ([[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|R<sup>2</sup>]] of 0.68).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Use of relative weight and Body Mass Index for the determination of adiposity |last1=Gray |first1=D.

There has been an acceptance in recent years that abdominal fat and weight around the abdomen constitute a greater health risk.<ref>{{cite web |last=Craver |first=R. |date=10 September 2008 |url=http://www.wakehealth.edu/Gerontology-and-Geriatrics/Location,-not-volume,-of-fat-found-to-be-key.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515223636/http://www.wakehealth.edu/Gerontology-and-Geriatrics/Location,-not-volume,-of-fat-found-to-be-key.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 May 2013 |title=Location, not volume, of fat found to be key |publisher=Journalnow.com |accessdate=2008-10-09 }}</ref>\n*[[weighing scale|Simple weighing]]\n:A person's weight is measured and compared to an estimated ideal weight. This is the easiest and most common method, but by far the least accurate, as it only measures one quantity (weight) and often does not take into account many factors such as height, [[body type]], and relative amount of [[muscle]] mass.\n*Skinfold [[caliper]]s or \"pinch test\"\n:The skin at several specific points on the body is pinched and the thickness of the resulting fold is measured.  This measures the thickness of the layers of fat located under the skin, from which a general measurement of total amount of fat in the body is calculated.  This method can be reasonably accurate for many people, but it assumes particular fat distribution patterns over the body\u2014which may not apply to all individuals, and does not account for fat deposits not directly under the skin.  Also, as the measurement and analysis generally involves a high degree of practice and interpretation, an accurate result requires that a professional perform it. It cannot generally be done by patients themselves.\n*[[Bioelectrical impedance analysis]]\n:A small electric current is passed through the body to measure its [[electrical resistance]]. As fat and muscle conduct electricity differently, this method can provide a direct measurement of the body fat percentage, in relation to muscle mass. In the past, this technique could only be performed reliably by trained professionals with specialized equipment, but it is now possible to buy home testing kits that let people do this themselves with a minimum of training.  Despite the improved simplicity of this process over the years, however, a number of factors can affect the results, including [[Fluid replacement|hydration]] and [[body temperature]], so it still needs some care when taking the test to ensure that the results are accurate.\n*[[hydrostatic equilibrium|Hydrostatic]] weighing\n:Considered one of the more accurate methods of measuring body fat, this technique involves complete submersion of a person in water, with special equipment to measure the person's weight while submerged. This weight is then compared with \"dry weight\" as recorded outside the water to determine overall body density. As fat is less dense than muscle, careful application of this technique can provide a reasonably close estimate of fat content in the body.  This technique does, however, require expensive specialized equipment and trained professionals to administer it properly.\n*[[Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DEXA)\n:Originally developed to measure bone density, DEXA imaging is also used to precisely determine body fat content by using the density of various body tissues to identify which portions of the body are fat. This test is generally considered very accurate, but requires a great deal of expensive medical equipment and trained professionals to perform.\n\nThe most common method for discussing this subject and the one used primarily by researchers and advisory institutions is BMI. Definitions of what is considered overweight vary by ethnicity. The current definition proposed by the US [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) designates whites, Hispanics and blacks with a BMI of 25 or more as overweight. For Asians, overweight is a BMI between 23 and 29.9 and obesity for all groups is a BMI of 30 or more.\n\nBMI, however, does not account extremes of muscle mass, some rare [[genetics|genetic]] factors, the very young, and a few other individual variations.  Thus it is possible for an individuals with a BMI of less than 25 to have excess body fat, while others may have a BMI that is significantly higher without falling into this category.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Dympna |last1=Gallagher |first2=S.

{"title_page": "Miniature shrine", "text_new": "A '''miniature shrine''', also referred to in literature as a '''portable shrine,''' '''pocket shrine''', or a '''travel altar''', is a small, generally moveable [[shrine]] or [[altar]].

The stela is 100&nbsp;cm high and made of limestone. Osiris is depicted standing under a winged sun disk facing [[Senwosret III]]. The text is laid out below Osiris in twenty-four horizontal lines. Underneath the text, [[Ikhernofret]], a [[12th dynasty]] treasurer under Pharaoh [[Senwosret III]], is depicted at an offering table with his family.<ref name=\"simpson\">\"''The Literature of Ancient Egypt''\", [[William Kelly Simpson]], p425\u2013427, Yale University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-300-09920-7}}</ref> It reads:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=I acted as Son, Whom He Loves, for Osiris, First of the Westerners, I adorned the great [...] forever and ever.

It dates perhaps to the [[18th Dynasty]].\n\nOne of the best-known artifacts of Ancient Egypt is the [[Anubis Shrine]], which is in a portable form, placed atop a [[palanquin]]. The statue of a recumbent jackal is attached to the roof of the shrine. The statue is made from wood, covered with black paint. The insides of the ears, the eyebrows, and the rims of the eyes, and the collar and the band knotted around the neck, are worked in gold leaf.\n[[File:Anubi.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the statue (presumably of [[Anubis]]) placed on top of the shrine.]]\n\n====Phoenicia====\n<ref>Hill, G. (1911). Some Graeco-Phoenician Shrines. The Journal of Hellenic Studies, 31, 56\u201364. {{doi|10.2307/624736}}</ref>\n====Greece====\n====Rome====\n{{Main|Lares}}\nBy the early Imperial period, household shrines were known generically as lararia (plural lararium) because they typically housed a figure of a [[Lares]],  guardian deities in ancient Roman religion. Painted lararia from Pompeii show two Lares flanking a genius or ancestor-figure, who wears his toga in the priestly manner prescribed for sacrificers. Underneath this trio, a serpent, representing the fertility of fields or the principle of generative power, winds towards an altar. The essentials of sacrifice are depicted around and about; bowl and knife, incense box, libation vessels and parts of sacrificial animals. In households of modest means, small Lar statuettes were set in wall-niches, sometimes merely a tile-support projecting from a painted background. In wealthier households, they tend to be found in servant's quarters and working areas. [[File:Casa dei Vettii - Larario.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Lararium at the House of the Vettii: Two Lares, each holding a [[rhyton]], flank an ancestor-''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' holding a [[patera|libation bowl]] and incense box, his [[capite velato|head covered]] as if for sacrifice. The snake, associated with the land's fertility and thus prosperity, approaches a low, laden altar. The shrine's [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] shows a ''[[patera]]'', [[bucranium|ox-skull]] and sacrificial knife.]] The placing of Lares in the public or semi-public parts of a house, such as its [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], enrolled them in the more outward, theatrical functions of household religion.\n\n===Medieval===\n====Asia====\nIn Buddhism, portable shrines were made so that devout travelers with nowhere to worship could carry their shrines with them. The shrines were two-piece, and could be shut together to preserve the artwork.\nMiniature buddhas and goddesses could be carried in small lacquer cases carried on the wrist. \n\nIn Tibet, shrines called ''gau'' are worn as jewelry.\n\nThe [[mikoshi]] is a Japanese type of portable shrine used mostly during Shinto religious festivals called [[matsuri]].\n\n====Christian Europe====\n\nThe [[Monymusk Reliquary]] is an eighth-century Scottish reliquary made of wood and metal characterized by an Insular fusion of Gaelic and Pictish design and Anglo-Saxon metalworking, probably by Ionan monks. It is now in the [[National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh]]. It is characterised by a mixture of Pictish artistic designs and Irish artistic traditions (perhaps first brought to Scotland by Irish missionaries in the sixth century), fused with Anglo-Saxon metalworking techniques, an artistic movement now classified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon art.

It dates perhaps to the [[18th Dynasty]].\n\nOne of the best-known artifacts of Ancient Egypt is the [[Anubis Shrine]], which is in a portable form, placed atop a [[palanquin]]. The statue of a recumbent jackal is attached to the roof of the shrine. The statue is made from wood, covered with black paint. The insides of the ears, the eyebrows, and the rims of the eyes, and the collar and the band knotted around the neck, are worked in gold leaf.\n[[File:Anubi.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the statue (presumably of [[Anubis]]) placed on top of the shrine.]]\n\n====Phoenicia====\n<ref>Hill, G.

Painted lararia from Pompeii show two Lares flanking a genius or ancestor-figure, who wears his toga in the priestly manner prescribed for sacrificers. Underneath this trio, a serpent, representing the fertility of fields or the principle of generative power, winds towards an altar. The essentials of sacrifice are depicted around and about; bowl and knife, incense box, libation vessels and parts of sacrificial animals. In households of modest means, small Lar statuettes were set in wall-niches, sometimes merely a tile-support projecting from a painted background. In wealthier households, they tend to be found in servant's quarters and working areas. [[File:Casa dei Vettii - Larario.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Lararium at the House of the Vettii: Two Lares, each holding a [[rhyton]], flank an ancestor-''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' holding a [[patera|libation bowl]] and incense box, his [[capite velato|head covered]] as if for sacrifice. The snake, associated with the land's fertility and thus prosperity, approaches a low, laden altar. The shrine's [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] shows a ''[[patera]]'', [[bucranium|ox-skull]] and sacrificial knife.]] The placing of Lares in the public or semi-public parts of a house, such as its [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], enrolled them in the more outward, theatrical functions of household religion.\n\n===Medieval===\n====Asia====\nIn Buddhism, portable shrines were made so that devout travelers with nowhere to worship could carry their shrines with them. The shrines were two-piece, and could be shut together to preserve the artwork.\nMiniature buddhas and goddesses could be carried in small lacquer cases carried on the wrist. \n\nIn Tibet, shrines called ''gau'' are worn as jewelry.\n\nThe [[mikoshi]] is a Japanese type of portable shrine used mostly during Shinto religious festivals called [[matsuri]].\n\n====Christian Europe====\n\nThe [[Monymusk Reliquary]] is an eighth-century Scottish reliquary made of wood and metal characterized by an Insular fusion of Gaelic and Pictish design and Anglo-Saxon metalworking, probably by Ionan monks. It is now in the [[National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh]]. It is characterised by a mixture of Pictish artistic designs and Irish artistic traditions (perhaps first brought to Scotland by Irish missionaries in the sixth century), fused with Anglo-Saxon metalworking techniques, an artistic movement now classified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon art. The casket is wooden, but is covered with silver and copper-alloy.\n\nA particularly well-preserved portable shrine, the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]] in the [[Cologne Cathedral]], is archetypal of the [[Romanesque style]] of [[reliquaries]].

The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the [[San Diego]] shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees [[Climate of the Los Angeles Basin|warmer]] than at the coast. The same [[microclimate]] phenomenon is seen in the [[San Francisco Bay Area#Climate|climate]] of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas closer to the ocean.\n\nNorthern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], have an [[alpine climate]] with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.\n\nCalifornia's mountains produce [[rain shadow]]s on the eastern side, creating extensive [[desert]]s.

The [[Mojave River]] is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the [[Santa Ana River]] drains much of the [[Transverse Ranges]] as it bisects Southern California. The [[Colorado River]] forms the state's southeast border with [[Arizona]].\n\nMost of California's major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the [[Central Valley Project]], providing water for agriculture in the Central Valley, and the [[California State Water Project]] diverting water from northern to southern California.

From 1899 to 1939, California had Republican governors. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor [[Gavin Newsom]]; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more [[Centrism|centrist]] than the national party.\n\nThe Democrats also now hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 60 Democrats and 20 Republicans in the Assembly; and 29 Democrats and 11 Republicans in the Senate.\n\nThe trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections. From [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] through [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], California was a Republican leaning state, with the party carrying the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in nine of ten elections, with [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] as the exception. Southern California Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were both elected twice as the 37th and 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes for the last seven elections,<!--7 thru 2016--> starting in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].\n\nIn the United States House, the Democrats held a 34\u201319 edge in the CA delegation of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained four seats and held a 38\u201315 majority in the delegation. Following the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm House elections]], Democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in California, leaving Republicans with seven.\n\nIn general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] had remained largely Republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections, in which a majority of the county's votes were cast for Democratic candidates.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ocvote.com/fileadmin/live/gen2016/results.htm|title=2016 Presidential General Election|website=Ocvote.com|access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://latimes.com/la-ol-opinion-newsletter-midterm-election-20181110-htmlstory.html |title=RIP Republican Orange County |last=Thornton |first=Paul |date=November 10, 2018 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> One study ranked [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and [[San Francisco]] in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]], and [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] in the top 20 most conservative cities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research |title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities |date=August 16, 2005 |access-date=February 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110501140306/http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |archive-date=May 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, out of the 23,802,577 people eligible to vote, 18,245,970 people were registered to vote.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\">{{cite web |url= http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |title=Voter Registration by County |author=|date=October 22, 2012 |website=Elections |publisher=California Secretary of State |access-date=January 12, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117084449/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013 }}</ref> Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (7,966,422), Republicans (5,356,608), and [[Decline to State]] (3,820,545).<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" /> [[Los Angeles County]] had the largest number of registered Democrats (2,430,612) and Republicans (1,037,031) of any county in the state.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|California|United States}}\n* [[Index of California-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of California]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n\n* {{cite book|first=Saul Bernard|last=Cohen|title=Geopolitics of the World System|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=QkMD8HKRlgoC|page=115}}|date=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9907-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Starr |title=California: A History |series=Modern Library Chronicles |volume=23 |date=2007 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |isbn=978-0-8129-7753-0 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{Cite book |last=Chartkoff |first=Joseph L. |author2=Chartkoff, Kerry Kona |date=1984 |title=The archaeology of California |location=Stanford |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8047-1157-9 |oclc=11351549 |url= https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofcal00char }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Fagan |first=Brian |date=2003 |title=Before California: An archaeologist looks at our earliest inhabitants |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield Publishers]] |isbn=978-0-7425-2794-2 |oclc=226025645}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hart |first=James D. |date=1978 |title=A Companion to California |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-502400-5 |oclc=}}\n* Matthews, Glenna.

The lightly populated and arid lower region of old Baja California remained as a part of [[Mexico]]. In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769.<ref name=\"Osborne2012\">{{cite book|first=Thomas J. |last=Osborne|title=Pacific Eldorado: A History of Greater California|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=FvA3jL4CFCMC}}|date=November 29, 2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-29217-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1848, only one week before the official American annexation of the area, gold was discovered in California, this being an event which was to forever alter both the state's demographics and its finances.

The population burgeoned with United States citizens, Europeans, Chinese and other immigrants during the great [[California Gold Rush]].

Still, several smaller military units within the Union army were unofficially associated with the state of California, such as the [[2nd Regiment of Cavalry, Massachusetts Volunteers|\"California 100 Company\"]], due to a majority of their members being from California.\n\nAt the time of California's admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time-consuming and dangerous feat. Nineteen years afterwards, in 1869, shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War, a more direct connection was developed with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. California was then easy to reach.\n\nMuch of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere.\n\n====Indigenous peoples====\n\n[[File:Yokayo-People-at-Ukiah-California-1916.JPG|thumb|right| ]]\n\nUnder earlier Spanish and Mexican rule, California's original native population had precipitously declined, above all, from Eurasian diseases to which the indigenous people of California had not yet developed a natural immunity.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617|title=Destruction of the California Indians|publisher=[[California Secretary of State]]|access-date=April 15, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111207115225/http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617|archive-date=December 7, 2011}}</ref> Under its new American administration, California's harsh governmental policies towards its own indigenous people did not improve.

The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the [[San Diego]] shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees [[Climate of the Los Angeles Basin|warmer]] than at the coast. The same [[microclimate]] phenomenon is seen in the [[San Francisco Bay Area#Climate|climate]] of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas closer to the ocean.\n\nNorthern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], have an [[alpine climate]] with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.\n\nCalifornia's mountains produce [[rain shadow]]s on the eastern side, creating extensive [[desert]]s. The higher elevation deserts of [[eastern California]] have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters.

From 1899 to 1939, California had Republican governors. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor [[Gavin Newsom]]; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more [[Centrism|centrist]] than the national party.\n\nThe Democrats also now hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 60 Democrats and 20 Republicans in the Assembly; and 29 Democrats and 11 Republicans in the Senate.\n\nThe trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections. From [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] through [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], California was a Republican leaning state, with the party carrying the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in nine of ten elections, with [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] as the exception. Southern California Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were both elected twice as the 37th and 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes for the last seven elections,<!--7 thru 2016--> starting in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].\n\nIn the United States House, the Democrats held a 34\u201319 edge in the CA delegation of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained four seats and held a 38\u201315 majority in the delegation. Following the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm House elections]], Democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in California, leaving Republicans with seven.\n\nIn general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] had remained largely Republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections, in which a majority of the county's votes were cast for Democratic candidates.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ocvote.com/fileadmin/live/gen2016/results.htm|title=2016 Presidential General Election|website=Ocvote.com|access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://latimes.com/la-ol-opinion-newsletter-midterm-election-20181110-htmlstory.html |title=RIP Republican Orange County |last=Thornton |first=Paul |date=November 10, 2018 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> One study ranked [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and [[San Francisco]] in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]], and [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] in the top 20 most conservative cities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research |title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities |date=August 16, 2005 |access-date=February 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110501140306/http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |archive-date=May 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, out of the 23,802,577 people eligible to vote, 18,245,970 people were registered to vote.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\">{{cite web |url= http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |title=Voter Registration by County |author=|date=October 22, 2012 |website=Elections |publisher=California Secretary of State |access-date=January 12, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117084449/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013 }}</ref> Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (7,966,422), Republicans (5,356,608), and [[Decline to State]] (3,820,545).<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" /> [[Los Angeles County]] had the largest number of registered Democrats (2,430,612) and Republicans (1,037,031) of any county in the state.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|California|United States}}\n* [[Index of California-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of California]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n\n* {{cite book|first=Saul Bernard|last=Cohen|title=Geopolitics of the World System|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=QkMD8HKRlgoC|page=115}}|date=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9907-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Starr |title=California: A History |series=Modern Library Chronicles |volume=23 |date=2007 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |isbn=978-0-8129-7753-0 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{Cite book |last=Chartkoff |first=Joseph L. |author2=Chartkoff, Kerry Kona |date=1984 |title=The archaeology of California |location=Stanford |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8047-1157-9 |oclc=11351549 |url= https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofcal00char }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Fagan |first=Brian |date=2003 |title=Before California: An archaeologist looks at our earliest inhabitants |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield Publishers]] |isbn=978-0-7425-2794-2 |oclc=226025645}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hart |first=James D. |date=1978 |title=A Companion to California |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-502400-5 |oclc=}}\n* Matthews, Glenna.
