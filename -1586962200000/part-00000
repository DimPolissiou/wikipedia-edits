The film is an adaptation of the 1959 [[Musical theatre|stage musical]] of [[The Sound of Music|the same name]], composed by [[Richard Rodgers]] with lyrics by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. The film's screenplay was written by [[Ernest Lehman]], adapted from the stage musical's [[Libretto|book]] by [[Lindsay and Crouse]]. Based on the memoir ''[[The Story of the Trapp Family Singers]]'' by [[Maria von Trapp]], the film is about a young Austrian [[postulant]] in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], in 1938 who is sent to the villa of a retired naval officer and widower to be governess to his seven children.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/opinion/hollywood-s-widower-fantasy.html|title=Hollywood's Widower Fantasy|last=Yoffe|first=Emily|date=1993-08-08|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-02-05|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205185041/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/opinion/hollywood-s-widower-fantasy.html|archivedate=February 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After bringing love and music into the lives of the family, she marries the officer and, together with the children, finds a way to survive the loss of their homeland to the Nazis.\n\nThe film was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited [[roadshow theatrical release]]. Although critical response to the film was mixed, the film was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office movie after four weeks, and [[List of highest-grossing films#High-grossing films by year|the highest-grossing film of 1965]]. By November 1966, ''The Sound of Music'' had become the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] of all-time\u2014surpassing ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''\u2014and held that distinction for five years. The film was just as popular throughout the world, breaking previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries. Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years, and two successful re-releases, the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286,000,000.\n\n''The Sound of Music'' received five [[38th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. The film also received two [[23rd Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]], for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], the Directors Guild of America Award for [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film|Outstanding Directorial Achievement]], and the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 1965|Writers Guild of America Award]] for Best Written American Musical. In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) listed ''The Sound of Music'' as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|fifty-fifth]] greatest American movie of all time, and the [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals|fourth]] greatest movie musical. In 2001, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Salzburg, Austria]] in 1938, Maria is a free-spirited young [[postulant]] at [[Nonnberg Abbey]]. Her love of music and the mountains, her youthful enthusiasm and imagination, and her lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children. The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl, the oldest, is won over after Maria protects her from discovery when she is nearly caught sneaking back into the house after meeting with Rolfe, a messenger boy she is in love with.\n\nWhile the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with the wealthy socialite Baroness Elsa Schraeder and their mutual friend, the musical agent Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. The Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay.\n\nImpressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter them in the upcoming [[Salzburg Festival]], but the suggestion is immediately rejected by the Captain as he is opposed to his children singing in public. He does agree, however, to organize a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional ''[[L\u00e4ndler]]'' folk dance, he cuts in and dances with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, convinces Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed, and after breaking off his engagement, the Captain marries Maria.\n\nWhile the Captain and Maria are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. When they learn that Austria has been annexed by the [[Third Reich]] in the ''[[Anschluss]]'', the couple return to their home, where a telegram awaits informing the Captain that he must report to the German Naval base at [[Bremerhaven]] to accept a commission in the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]]. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and the ''Anschluss'', the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately for Switzerland. Many of the Von Trapps' friends are prepared to accept the new regime, including Rolfe, who has joined the [[Hitler Youth]]. That night, as the von Trapp family attempt to leave, they are stopped by a group of [[Sturmabteilung|Brownshirts]] waiting outside the villa. When questioned by ''[[Gauleiter]]'' Hans Zeller, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven.\n\nLater that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where the nuns hide them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts soon arrive and search the abbey, and the family is discovered by Rolfe. Upon seeing Liesl, he hesitates to raise the alarm (long enough to allow the family time to flee), and the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the [[Swiss Alps]] into Switzerland.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Julie Andrews]] as [[Maria von Trapp]]\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as [[Georg von Trapp|Captain von Trapp]]\n** [[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]] overdubbed Plummer's singing<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/11/24/165806779/the-unsung-overdub-star-in-sound-of-music |title=The Unsung Overdub Star In 'Sound Of Music' |work=NPR |date=November 24, 2012 |accessdate=May 10, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Eleanor Parker]] as Baroness Elsa von Schraeder\n* [[Richard Haydn]] as Max Detweiler\n* [[Peggy Wood]] as the [[Virgilia, Mother Abbess|Mother Abbess]]\n* [[Charmian Carr]] as Liesl von Trapp\n* [[Nicholas Hammond]] as Friedrich von Trapp\n* [[Heather Menzies]] as Louisa von Trapp\n* [[Duane Chase]] as Kurt von Trapp\n* [[Angela Cartwright]] as Brigitta von Trapp\n* [[Debbie Turner]] as Marta von Trapp\n* [[Kym Karath]] as Gretl von Trapp\n* [[Anna Lee]] as Sister Margaretta\n* [[Portia Nelson]] as Sister Berthe\n* [[Ben Wright (English actor)|Ben Wright]] as Herr Zeller\n* [[Daniel Truhitte]] as Rolfe\n* [[Norma Varden]] as Frau Schmidt, housekeeper\n* Gil Stuart as Franz, servant\n* [[Marni Nixon]] as Sister Sophia\n* Ada Beth Lee as Sister Catherine (uncredited)\n* Doreen Tryden as Sister Agatha (uncredited)\n* [[Evadne Baker]] as Sister Bernice\n* [[Doris Lloyd]] as Baroness Ebberfeld\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Background==\n{{multiple image\n| align =\n| direction =\n| footer = Composer [[Richard Rodgers]] and lyricist [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]\n| image1 = Richard Rodgers 1948.jpg\n| width1 = 175\n| image2 = Oscar Hammerstein - portrait.jpg\n| width2 = 175\n| alt = Portrait photos of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II\n}}\n''The Sound of Music'' story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir, ''The Story of the Trapp Family Singers'', [[1949 in literature|published in 1949]] to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband [[Georg von Trapp|Georg]] in 1947.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\">Hirsch 1993, p. 4.</ref> Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/> In 1956, German producer [[Wolfgang Liebeneiner]] purchased the film rights for $9,000 ({{Inflation|US|9000|1956|r=-3|fmt=eq}}), hired [[George Hurdalek]] and [[Herbert Reinecker]] to write the screenplay, and [[Franz Grothe]] to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional [[Folk song|Austrian folk songs]].<ref name=\"hirsch-6\">Hirsch 1993, p. 6.</ref> ''[[The Trapp Family]]'' was released in [[West Germany]] on October 9, 1956 and became a major success.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/> Two years later, Liebeneiner directed a [[sequel]], ''[[The Trapp Family in America]]'', and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/> Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/>\n\nIn 1956, [[Paramount Pictures]] purchased the United States film rights, intending to produce an English-language version with [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Maria.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/> The studio eventually dropped its option, but one of its directors, [[Vincent J.

Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material.<ref name=\"hirsch-28\">Hirsch 1993, p. 28.</ref> While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director. Their first choice was [[Robert Wise]], with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]''.<ref name=\"hirsch-13\">Hirsch 1993, p. 13.</ref> Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including [[Stanley Donen]], [[Vincent J.

After seeing the show, Wyler said he hated it, but after two weeks of Lehman's persuasion, Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film.<ref name=\"hirsch-13-14\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 13\u201314.</ref> After hiring musical supervisor [[Roger Edens]], Wyler, Lehman, and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations.<ref name=\"hirsch-15\">Hirsch 1993, p. 15.</ref> In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy-five locations\u2014an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences.<ref name=\"hirsch-31\">Hirsch 1993, p. 31.</ref> During that trip, Lehman began to have reservations about Wyler's commitment to the project, and communicated this to Zanuck, who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"hirsch-16\">Hirsch 1993, p. 16.</ref> Lehman completed the first draft on September 10, 1963 and sent it to Wyler, who had no suggestions or changes.<ref name=\"hirsch-16\"/> At that time, Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise, whom Lehman still wanted as the director.<ref name=\"hirsch-16\"/> Later that month, Wyler's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct ''[[The Collector (1965 film)|The Collector]]''. Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film, and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director, ending Wyler's participation.<ref name=\"hirsch-16\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Wise, whose film ''The Sand Pebbles'' had been postponed, read Lehman's first draft, was impressed by what he read, and agreed to direct the film.<ref name=\"hirsch-17\">Hirsch 1993, p. 17.</ref> Wise joined the picture in October 1963,<ref name=\"hirsch-34\">Hirsch 1993, p. 34.</ref> and flew to Salzburg with associate producer [[Saul Chaplin]] and members of his production team to scout filming locations, including many that Wyler had identified.<ref name=\"hirsch-75-78\">Hirsch 1993, p. 75, 78.</ref> When he returned, Wise began working on the script. Wise shared Lehman's vision of the film being centered on the music, and the changes he made were consistent with the writer's approach\u2014mainly reducing the amount of sweetness and sentimentality found in the stage musical.<ref name=\"hirsch-34\"/> He had reservations about Lehman's opening aerial sequence because ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]],'' whose screenplay Lehman had also written, had used a similar opening sequence, but he was unable to think of a better one and decided to keep Lehman's.<ref name=\"hirsch-34\"/> Other changes included replacing \"An Ordinary Couple\" with a more romantic number, and a new song for Maria's departure from the abbey\u2014Rodgers provided \"Something Good\" and \"I Have Confidence\" especially for the film.<ref name=\"hirsch-34-37\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 34\u201337.</ref> Lehman completed the second draft on December 20, 1963,<ref name=\"hirsch-38\">Hirsch 1993, p. 38.</ref> but additional changes would be made based on input from Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer about the character of the Captain.

For the role of Max Detweiler, Wise initially considered [[Victor Borge]], [[No\u00ebl Coward]], and [[Hal Holbrook]] among others before deciding on Richard Haydn.<ref name=\"hirsch-53-54\"/> For the character of Baroness Elsa Schraeder, Wise looked for a \"name\" actress\u2014Andrews and Plummer were not yet widely known to film audiences\u2014and decided on Eleanor Parker.<ref name=\"hirsch-54-55\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 54\u201355.</ref> The casting of the children characters began in November 1963 and involved over two hundred interviews and auditions throughout the United States and England.<ref name=\"hirsch-61\">Hirsch 1993, p. 61.</ref> Some of the child-actors interviewed or tested, who were not selected, included [[Mia Farrow]], [[Patty Duke]], [[Lesley Ann Warren]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Shelley Fabares]], [[Teri Garr]], [[Kurt Russell]], and [[The Osmonds]].<ref name=\"hirsch-61-63\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 61\u201363.</ref> Most of the actors selected had some acting, singing, or dancing experience.

Julie Andrews hosted the four-hour telecast which presented the musical numbers in a [[letterbox]] format. As the film's home video availability cut into its television ratings, NBC let their contract lapse in 2001. That year, the film was broadcast one time on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network, in its heavily edited 140-minute version. Since 2002, the film has aired on ABC, generally during Christmas week, and has been broadcast on its sister cable network, [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], periodically around Easter and other holidays. Most of its more recent runs have been the full version in a four-hour time slot, complete with the entr'acte. ABC first broadcast a [[high definition television|high definition]] version on December 28, 2008. On December 22, 2013, the annual broadcast had its highest ratings since 2007; the increase in ratings were credited to NBC's broadcast of ''[[The Sound of Music Live!]]''\u2014a live television adaptation of the original musical which aired earlier that month.<ref name=deadline-ratings/>\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the film rights were acquired by the [[BBC]], who paid a corporation record $4.1 million,<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=September 28, 1978|page=4|title=Stanfill Says Fox' 3d-Qtr.

The film was influenced by other musicals of its era, such as ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] television production of ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]'', and the stage production of [[Lerner and Loewe]]'s ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' (coincidentally all starring [[Julie Andrews]]). Screenwriter [[Ernest Lehman]] was inspired by the opening of ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' and saw the musical as \"a fairy tale that's almost real\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.la-screenwriter.com/2015/04/16/the-sound-of-music-and-the-thrill-of-screenwriting/ |first=Scott |last=Holleran |title=The Sound of Music and the Thrill of Screenwriting|website=LA-Screenwriter.com|language=en-US|access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref> The film incorporated many \"fairy tale\" tropes which included the idyllic imagery (placed in the hills of [[Salzburg]]), the European villas, and the cross-class Cinderella-like romance between Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As Maria walks down the aisle to be married, the pageantry is explicitly both [[Guinevere]] and Cinderella.<ref name=\"Flinn\">Flinn 2015</ref>{{page number needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn keeping with this tone the filmmakers used [[artistic license]] to convey the essence and meaning of their story. [[Georg Ludwig von Trapp]] was indeed an anti-Nazi opposed to the [[Anschluss]], and lived with his family in a villa in a district of Salzburg called [[Aigen (Salzburg city district)|Aigen]]. Their lifestyle depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living. The actual family villa, located at Traunstra\u00dfe 34, Aigen 5026, was large and comfortable but not nearly as grand as the mansion depicted in the film. The house was also not their ancestral home, as depicted in the film. The family had previously lived in homes in [[Zell Am See]] and [[Klosterneuburg]] after being forced to abandon their actual ancestral home in [[Pula|Pola]] following [[World War I]]. Georg moved the family to the Salzburg villa shortly after the death of his first wife in 1922.<ref name=\"archives\"/> In the film, Georg is referred to as \"[[Captain]]\", but his actual family title was \"[[Ritter]]\" (German for \"knight\"), a hereditary knighthood the equivalent of which in the United Kingdom is a baronetcy. Austrian nobility, moreover, was legally abolished in 1919 and the [[nobiliary particle]] ''von'' was proscribed after World War I, so he was legally \"Georg Trapp\". Both the title and the prepositional nobiliary particle ''von'', however, continued to be widely used unofficially as a matter of courtesy.<ref name=\"archives\"/>\n\nGeorg was offered a position in the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', but this occurred before the Anschluss. He was heavily courted by the Nazis because he had extensive experience with submarines, and Germany was looking to expand its fleet of [[U-boats]]. With his family in desperate financial straits, and having no marketable skills other than his training as a naval officer, he seriously considered the offer before deciding he could not serve a Nazi regime. Rather than threaten arrest, the Nazis actually continued to woo him.<ref name=\"archives\"/> In the film, Georg is depicted initially as a humorless, emotionally distant father. In reality, third child Maria von Trapp (called \"Louisa\" in the film) described her father as a doting parent who made handmade gifts for the children in his woodshop and who would often lead family musicales on his violin. She has a different recollection of her stepmother, whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage. In a 2003 interview, Maria remembered, \"[She] had a terrible temper ... and from one moment to the next, you didn't know what hit her. We were not used to this. But we took it like a thunderstorm that would pass, because the next minute she could be very nice.\"<ref name=\"tfl-family\"/>\n\n[[Maria von Trapp|Maria Augusta Kutschera]] had indeed been a novice at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and had been hired by the von Trapp family. However, she was hired only to be a tutor to young [[Maria Franziska von Trapp|Maria Franziska]] (\"Louisa\" in the movie), who had come down with scarlet fever and needed her lessons at home, not to be a governess for all of the children.<ref name=\"archives\"/> Maria and Georg married for practical reasons, rather than love and affection for each other. Georg needed a mother for his children, and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey. \"I really and truly was not in love,\" Maria wrote in her memoir, \"I liked him but didn't love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children. I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after.\" They were married in 1927, not in 1938 as depicted in the film, and the couple had been married for over a decade by the time of the Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time. Maria later acknowledged that she grew to love Georg over time and enjoyed a happy marriage.<ref name=\"archives\"/>\n\nThe von Trapp family lost most of its wealth during the [[Great Depression|worldwide depression of the early 1930s]], when the Austrian national bank folded.<ref name=\"archives\"/> In order to survive, the family dismissed the servants and began taking in boarders. They also started singing onstage to earn money, a fact that caused the proud Georg much embarrassment.<ref name=\"hirsch-201-202\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 201\u2013202.</ref> In the film, the von Trapp family hike over the Alps from Austria to Switzerland to escape the Nazis, which would not have been possible; Salzburg is over two hundred miles from Switzerland. The von Trapp villa, however, was only a few kilometers from the Austria\u2013Germany border, and the final scene shows the family hiking on the Obersalzberg near the German town of [[Berchtesgaden]], within sight of Adolf Hitler's [[Kehlsteinhaus]] Eagle's Nest retreat. In reality, the family simply walked to the local train station and boarded a train to Italy. Although Georg was an ethnic German-Austrian, he was also an Italian citizen, having been born in the [[Dalmatia]]n city of [[Zadar]], which at that time was part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], and later fell into Italian territory after World War I. From Italy, they traveled to London and ultimately the United States.<ref name=\"archives\"/>\n\nThe character Max Detweiler, the scheming family music director, is fictional. The von Trapps' family priest, the Reverend [[Franz Wasner]], was their musical director for over twenty years and accompanied them when they left Austria.<ref name=\"archives\"/> The character of Friedrich, the second oldest child in the film version, was based on Rupert, the oldest of the real von Trapp children. Liesl, the oldest child in the film, was based on Agathe von Trapp, the second oldest in the real family. The names and ages of the children were changed, in part because the third child, who would be portrayed as \"Louisa\", was also named Maria, and producers thought that it would be confusing to have two characters called Maria in the film.<ref name=\"archives\"/> The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers.<ref name=\"archives\"/> Robert Wise met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to Richard Zanuck, that he was not making a \"documentary or realistic movie\" about her family, and that he would make the film with \"complete dramatic freedom\" in order to produce a \"fine and moving film\", one they could all be proud of.<ref>Hirsch 1993, p. 40.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1966, [[American Express]] created the first ''Sound of Music'' guided tour in Salzburg.<ref name=\"maslon-172\">Maslon

The film is an adaptation of the 1959 [[Musical theatre|stage musical]] of [[The Sound of Music|the same name]], composed by [[Richard Rodgers]] with lyrics by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. The film's screenplay was written by [[Ernest Lehman]], adapted from the stage musical's [[Libretto|book]] by [[Lindsay and Crouse]]. Based on the memoir ''[[The Story of the Trapp Family Singers]]'' by [[Maria von Trapp]], the film is about a young Austrian [[postulant]] in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], in 1938 who is sent to the villa of a retired naval officer and widower to be governess to his seven children.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/opinion/hollywood-s-widower-fantasy.html|title=Hollywood's Widower Fantasy|last=Yoffe|first=Emily|date=1993-08-08|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-02-05|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205185041/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/opinion/hollywood-s-widower-fantasy.html|archivedate=February 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After bringing love and music into the lives of the family, she marries the officer and, together with the children, finds a way to survive the loss of their homeland to the Nazis.\n\nThe film was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited [[roadshow theatrical release]]. Although critical response to the film was mixed, the film was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office movie after four weeks, and [[List of highest-grossing films#High-grossing films by year|the highest-grossing film of 1965]]. By November 1966, ''The Sound of Music'' had become the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] of all-time\u2014surpassing ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''\u2014and held that distinction for five years. The film was just as popular throughout the world, breaking previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries. Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years, and two successful re-releases, the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286,000,000.\n\n''The Sound of Music'' received five [[38th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. The film also received two [[23rd Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]], for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], the Directors Guild of America Award for [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film|Outstanding Directorial Achievement]], and the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 1965|Writers Guild of America Award]] for Best Written American Musical. In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) listed ''The Sound of Music'' as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|fifty-fifth]] greatest American movie of all time, and the [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals|fourth]] greatest movie musical. In 2001, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Salzburg, Austria]] in 1938, Maria is a free-spirited young [[postulant]] at [[Nonnberg Abbey]]. Her love of music and the mountains, her youthful enthusiasm and imagination, and her lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children. The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl, the oldest, is won over after Maria protects her from discovery when she is nearly caught sneaking back into the house after meeting with Rolfe, a messenger boy she is in love with.\n\nWhile the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with the wealthy socialite Baroness Elsa Schraeder and their mutual friend, the musical agent Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. The Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay.\n\nImpressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter them in the upcoming [[Salzburg Festival]], but the suggestion is immediately rejected by the Captain as he is opposed to his children singing in public. He does agree, however, to organize a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional ''[[L\u00e4ndler]]'' folk dance, he cuts in and dances with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, convinces Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed, and after breaking off his engagement, the Captain marries Maria.\n\nWhile the Captain and Maria are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. When they learn that Austria has been annexed by the [[Third Reich]] in the ''[[Anschluss]]'', the couple return to their home, where a telegram awaits informing the Captain that he must report to the German Naval base at [[Bremerhaven]] to accept a commission in the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]]. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and the ''Anschluss'', the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately for Switzerland. Many of the Von Trapps' friends are prepared to accept the new regime, including Rolfe, who has joined the [[Hitler Youth]]. That night, as the von Trapp family attempt to leave, they are stopped by a group of [[Sturmabteilung|Brownshirts]] waiting outside the villa. When questioned by ''[[Gauleiter]]'' Hans Zeller, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven.\n\nLater that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where the nuns hide them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts soon arrive and search the abbey, and the family is discovered by Rolfe. Upon seeing Liesl, he hesitates to raise the alarm (long enough to allow the family time to flee), and the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the [[Swiss Alps]] into Switzerland.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Julie Andrews]] as [[Maria von Trapp]]\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as [[Georg von Trapp|Captain von Trapp]]\n** [[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]] overdubbed Plummer's singing<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/11/24/165806779/the-unsung-overdub-star-in-sound-of-music |title=The Unsung Overdub Star In 'Sound Of Music' |work=NPR |date=November 24, 2012 |accessdate=May 10, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Eleanor Parker]] as Baroness Elsa von Schraeder\n* [[Richard Haydn]] as Max Detweiler\n* [[Peggy Wood]] as the [[Virgilia, Mother Abbess|Mother Abbess]]\n* [[Charmian Carr]] as Liesl von Trapp\n* [[Nicholas Hammond]] as Friedrich von Trapp\n* [[Heather Menzies]] as Louisa von Trapp\n* [[Duane Chase]] as Kurt von Trapp\n* [[Angela Cartwright]] as Brigitta von Trapp\n* [[Debbie Turner]] as Marta von Trapp\n* [[Kym Karath]] as Gretl von Trapp\n* [[Anna Lee]] as Sister Margaretta\n* [[Portia Nelson]] as Sister Berthe\n* [[Ben Wright (English actor)|Ben Wright]] as Herr Zeller\n* [[Daniel Truhitte]] as Rolfe\n* [[Norma Varden]] as Frau Schmidt, housekeeper\n* Gil Stuart as Franz, servant\n* [[Marni Nixon]] as Sister Sophia\n* Ada Beth Lee as Sister Catherine (uncredited)\n* Doreen Tryden as Sister Agatha (uncredited)\n* [[Evadne Baker]] as Sister Bernice\n* [[Doris Lloyd]] as Baroness Ebberfeld\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Background==\n{{multiple image\n| align =\n| direction =\n| footer = Composer [[Richard Rodgers]] and lyricist [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]\n| image1 = Richard Rodgers 1948.jpg\n| width1 = 175\n| image2 = Oscar Hammerstein - portrait.jpg\n| width2 = 175\n| alt = Portrait photos of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II\n}}\n''The Sound of Music'' story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir, ''The Story of the Trapp Family Singers'', [[1949 in literature|published in 1949]] to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband [[Georg von Trapp|Georg]] in 1947.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\">Hirsch 1993, p. 4.</ref> Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/> In 1956, German producer [[Wolfgang Liebeneiner]] purchased the film rights for $9,000 ({{Inflation|US|9000|1956|r=-3|fmt=eq}}), hired [[George Hurdalek]] and [[Herbert Reinecker]] to write the screenplay, and [[Franz Grothe]] to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional [[Folk song|Austrian folk songs]].<ref name=\"hirsch-6\">Hirsch 1993, p. 6.</ref> ''[[The Trapp Family]]'' was released in [[West Germany]] on October 9, 1956 and became a major success.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/> Two years later, Liebeneiner directed a [[sequel]], ''[[The Trapp Family in America]]'', and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/> Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/>\n\nIn 1956, [[Paramount Pictures]] purchased the United States film rights, intending to produce an English-language version with [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Maria.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/> The studio eventually dropped its option, but one of its directors, [[Vincent J.

''The Sound of Music'' was filmed from March 26 through September 1, 1964, with external scenes shot on location in Salzburg, Austria, and the surrounding region, and interior scenes filmed at the [[20th Century Fox]] studios in [[California]].\n\n===Screenplay and pre-production===\n[[File:Robert wise 1990.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Robert Wise smiling|Robert Wise, 1990]]\nIn December 1962, 20th Century Fox president [[Richard D. Zanuck]] hired Ernest Lehman to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of the stage musical.<ref name=\"hirsch-11\">Hirsch 1993, p. 11.</ref> Lehman reviewed the original script for the stage musical, rearranged the sequence of songs, and began transforming a work designed for the stage into a film that could use the camera to emphasize action and mood, and open the story up to the beautiful locations of Salzburg and the Austrian Alps.<ref name=\"hirsch-23-25\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 23\u201325.</ref> The \"Do-Re-Mi\" sequence in the play, for example, was originally a stagnant number; Lehman transformed it into a lively [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] showing some of the beautiful sites of Salzburg, as well as showing Maria and the children growing closer over time.<ref name=\"hirsch-23-25\"/> Lehman also eliminated two songs, \"How Can Love Survive?\" and \"[[No Way to Stop It]]\", sung by the characters of Elsa and Max.<ref name=\"hirsch-23-25\"/> In January 1963, he saw the Fox English-dubbed version of the two German films. Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material.<ref name=\"hirsch-28\">Hirsch 1993, p. 28.</ref> While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director. Their first choice was [[Robert Wise]], with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]''.<ref name=\"hirsch-13\">Hirsch 1993, p. 13.</ref> Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including [[Stanley Donen]], [[Vincent J.

After seeing the show, Wyler said he hated it, but after two weeks of Lehman's persuasion, Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film.<ref name=\"hirsch-13-14\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 13\u201314.</ref> After hiring musical supervisor [[Roger Edens]], Wyler, Lehman, and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations.<ref name=\"hirsch-15\">Hirsch 1993, p. 15.</ref> In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy-five locations\u2014an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences.<ref name=\"hirsch-31\">Hirsch 1993, p. 31.</ref> During that trip, Lehman began to have reservations about Wyler's commitment to the project, and communicated this to Zanuck, who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"hirsch-16\">Hirsch 1993, p. 16.</ref> Lehman completed the first draft on September 10, 1963 and sent it to Wyler, who had no suggestions or changes.<ref name=\"hirsch-16\"/> At that time, Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise, whom Lehman still wanted as the director.<ref name=\"hirsch-16\"/> Later that month, Wyler's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct ''[[The Collector (1965 film)|The Collector]]''. Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film, and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director, ending Wyler's participation.<ref name=\"hirsch-16\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Wise, whose film ''The Sand Pebbles'' had been postponed, read Lehman's first draft, was impressed by what he read, and agreed to direct the film.<ref name=\"hirsch-17\">Hirsch 1993, p. 17.</ref> Wise joined the picture in October 1963,<ref name=\"hirsch-34\">Hirsch 1993, p. 34.</ref> and flew to Salzburg with associate producer [[Saul Chaplin]] and members of his production team to scout filming locations, including many that Wyler had identified.<ref name=\"hirsch-75-78\">Hirsch 1993, p. 75, 78.</ref> When he returned, Wise began working on the script. Wise shared Lehman's vision of the film being centered on the music, and the changes he made were consistent with the writer's approach\u2014mainly reducing the amount of sweetness and sentimentality found in the stage musical.<ref name=\"hirsch-34\"/> He had reservations about Lehman's opening aerial sequence because ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]],'' whose screenplay Lehman had also written, had used a similar opening sequence, but he was unable to think of a better one and decided to keep Lehman's.<ref name=\"hirsch-34\"/> Other changes included replacing \"An Ordinary Couple\" with a more romantic number, and a new song for Maria's departure from the abbey\u2014Rodgers provided \"Something Good\" and \"I Have Confidence\" especially for the film.<ref name=\"hirsch-34-37\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 34\u201337.</ref> Lehman completed the second draft on December 20, 1963,<ref name=\"hirsch-38\">Hirsch 1993, p. 38.</ref> but additional changes would be made based on input from Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer about the character of the Captain.

For the role of Max Detweiler, Wise initially considered [[Victor Borge]], [[No\u00ebl Coward]], and [[Hal Holbrook]] among others before deciding on Richard Haydn.<ref name=\"hirsch-53-54\"/> For the character of Baroness Elsa Schraeder, Wise looked for a \"name\" actress\u2014Andrews and Plummer were not yet widely known to film audiences\u2014and decided on Eleanor Parker.<ref name=\"hirsch-54-55\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 54\u201355.</ref> The casting of the children characters began in November 1963 and involved over two hundred interviews and auditions throughout the United States and England.<ref name=\"hirsch-61\">Hirsch 1993, p. 61.</ref> Some of the child-actors interviewed or tested, who were not selected, included [[Mia Farrow]], [[Patty Duke]], [[Lesley Ann Warren]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Shelley Fabares]], [[Teri Garr]], [[Kurt Russell]], and [[The Osmonds]].<ref name=\"hirsch-61-63\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 61\u201363.</ref> Most of the actors selected had some acting, singing, or dancing experience.

Julie Andrews hosted the four-hour telecast which presented the musical numbers in a [[letterbox]] format. As the film's home video availability cut into its television ratings, NBC let their contract lapse in 2001. That year, the film was broadcast one time on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network, in its heavily edited 140-minute version. Since 2002, the film has aired on ABC, generally during Christmas week, and has been broadcast on its sister cable network, [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], periodically around Easter and other holidays. Most of its more recent runs have been the full version in a four-hour time slot, complete with the entr'acte. ABC first broadcast a [[high definition television|high definition]] version on December 28, 2008. On December 22, 2013, the annual broadcast had its highest ratings since 2007; the increase in ratings were credited to NBC's broadcast of ''[[The Sound of Music Live!]]''\u2014a live television adaptation of the original musical which aired earlier that month.<ref name=deadline-ratings/>\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the film rights were acquired by the [[BBC]], who paid a corporation record $4.1 million,<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=September 28, 1978|page=4|title=Stanfill Says Fox' 3d-Qtr.

The film was influenced by other musicals of its era, such as ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] television production of ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]'', and the stage production of [[Lerner and Loewe]]'s ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' (coincidentally all starring [[Julie Andrews]]). Screenwriter [[Ernest Lehman]] was inspired by the opening of ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' and saw the musical as \"a fairy tale that's almost real\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.la-screenwriter.com/2015/04/16/the-sound-of-music-and-the-thrill-of-screenwriting/ |first=Scott |last=Holleran |title=The Sound of Music and the Thrill of Screenwriting|website=LA-Screenwriter.com|language=en-US|access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref> The film incorporated many \"fairy tale\" tropes which included the idyllic imagery (placed in the hills of [[Salzburg]]), the European villas, and the cross-class Cinderella-like romance between Maria and Captain Von Trapp.  As Maria walks down the aisle to be married, the pageantry is explicitly both [[Guinevere]] and Cinderella.<ref name=\"Flinn\">Flinn 2015</ref>{{page number needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn keeping with this tone the filmmakers used [[artistic license]] to convey the essence and meaning of their story. [[Georg Ludwig von Trapp]] was indeed an anti-Nazi opposed to the [[Anschluss]], and lived with his family in a villa in a district of Salzburg called [[Aigen (Salzburg city district)|Aigen]]. Their lifestyle depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living. The actual family villa, located at Traunstra\u00dfe 34, Aigen 5026, was large and comfortable but not nearly as grand as the mansion depicted in the film. The house was also not their ancestral home, as depicted in the film. The family had previously lived in homes in [[Zell Am See]] and [[Klosterneuburg]] after being forced to abandon their actual ancestral home in [[Pula|Pola]] following [[World War I]]. Georg moved the family to the Salzburg villa shortly after the death of his first wife in 1922.<ref name=\"archives\"/> In the film, Georg is referred to as \"[[Captain]]\", but his actual family title was \"[[Ritter]]\" (German for \"knight\"), a hereditary knighthood the equivalent of which in the United Kingdom is a baronetcy. Austrian nobility, moreover, was legally abolished in 1919 and the [[nobiliary particle]] ''von'' was proscribed after World War I, so he was legally \"Georg Trapp\". Both the title and the prepositional nobiliary particle ''von'', however, continued to be widely used unofficially as a matter of courtesy.<ref name=\"archives\"/>\n\nGeorg was offered a position in the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', but this occurred before the Anschluss. He was heavily courted by the Nazis because he had extensive experience with submarines, and Germany was looking to expand its fleet of [[U-boats]]. With his family in desperate financial straits, and having no other marketable skills other than his training as a naval officer, he seriously considered the offer before deciding he could not serve a Nazi regime. Rather than threaten arrest, the Nazis actually continued to woo him.<ref name=\"archives\"/> In the film, Georg is depicted initially as a humorless, emotionally distant father. In reality, third child Maria von Trapp (called \"Louisa\" in the film) described her father as a doting parent who made handmade gifts for the children in his woodshop and who would often lead family musicales on his violin. She has a different recollection of her stepmother, whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage. In a 2003 interview, Maria remembered, \"[She] had a terrible temper ... and from one moment to the next, you didn't know what hit her. We were not used to this. But we took it like a thunderstorm that would pass, because the next minute she could be very nice.\"<ref name=\"tfl-family\"/>\n\n[[Maria von Trapp|Maria Augusta Kutschera]] had indeed been a novice at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and had been hired by the von Trapp family. However, she was hired only to be a tutor to young [[Maria Franziska von Trapp|Maria Franziska]] (\"Louisa\" in the movie), who had come down with scarlet fever and needed her lessons at home, not to be a governess for all of the children.<ref name=\"archives\"/> Maria and Georg married for practical reasons, rather than love and affection for each other. Georg needed a mother for his children, and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey. \"I really and truly was not in love,\" Maria wrote in her memoir, \"I liked him but didn't love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children. I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after.\" They were married in 1927, not in 1938 as depicted in the film, and the couple had been married for over a decade by the time of the Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time. Maria later acknowledged that she grew to love Georg over time and enjoyed a happy marriage.<ref name=\"archives\"/>\n\nThe von Trapp family lost most of its wealth during the [[Great Depression|worldwide depression of the early 1930s]], when the Austrian national bank folded.<ref name=\"archives\"/> In order to survive, the family dismissed the servants and began taking in boarders. They also started singing onstage to earn money, a fact that caused the proud Georg much embarrassment.<ref name=\"hirsch-201-202\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 201\u2013202.</ref> In the film, the von Trapp family hike over the Alps from Austria to Switzerland to escape the Nazis, which would not have been possible; Salzburg is over two hundred miles from Switzerland. The von Trapp villa, however, was only a few kilometers from the Austria\u2013Germany border, and the final scene shows the family hiking on the Obersalzberg near the German town of [[Berchtesgaden]], within sight of Adolf Hitler's [[Kehlsteinhaus]] Eagle's Nest retreat. In reality, the family simply walked to the local train station and boarded a train to Italy. Although Georg was an ethnic German-Austrian, he was also an Italian citizen, having been born in the [[Dalmatia]]n city of [[Zadar]], which at that time was part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], and later fell into Italian territory after World War I. From Italy, they traveled to London and ultimately the United States.<ref name=\"archives\"/>\n\nThe character Max Detweiler, the scheming family music director, is fictional. The von Trapps' family priest, the Reverend [[Franz Wasner]], was their musical director for over twenty years and accompanied them when they left Austria.<ref name=\"archives\"/> The character of Friedrich, the second oldest child in the film version, was based on Rupert, the oldest of the real von Trapp children. Liesl, the oldest child in the film, was based on Agathe von Trapp, the second oldest in the real family. The names and ages of the children were changed, in part because the third child, who would be portrayed as \"Louisa\", was also named Maria, and producers thought that it would be confusing to have two characters called Maria in the film.<ref name=\"archives\"/> The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers.<ref name=\"archives\"/> Robert Wise met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to Richard Zanuck, that he was not making a \"documentary or realistic movie\" about her family, and that he would make the film with \"complete dramatic freedom\" in order to produce a \"fine and moving film\", one they could all be proud of.<ref>Hirsch 1993, p. 40.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1966, [[American Express]] created the first ''Sound of Music'' guided tour in Salzburg.<ref name=\"maslon-172\">Maslon

An air pump or flexible [[diaphragm]] (usually motor-driven) varies the air pressure inside the tank, in continuous alternations, lowering and raising the air pressure in the cylinder. This causes the patient's chest to rise and fall, stimulating inhalation and exhalation through the patient's nose and mouth (which are outside the cylinder, exposed to ambient air pressure).<ref name=\"Non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" />\n\n===cuirass ventilator===\n'''cuirass ventilator''' also known as '''chest shell,''' '''turtle shell''' or '''tortise shell''' - A more compact variation of the iron lung, which only encloses the patient's torso, and is sealed around their neck and waist.<ref name=\"Non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\n===exovent===\nThe '''exovent''' is a modern device similar to the cuirass ventilator, but developed in 2020, in response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name=\"modern_iron_lung_2020_04_06_newatlas\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_and_2020_04_11_oxy_gen\" />\n\n===jacket ventilator===\nThe '''jacket ventilator,''' -- known as '''poncho''' or '''raincoat''' ventilator - is a lighter version of the iron lung or the cuirass ventilator, constructed of an airtight material (such as plastic or rubber) arranged over a light metal or plastic frame, or screen.<ref name=\"Non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" />\n\n===Positive-and-negative pressure ventilator===\n==== Pulmotor ====\nThe '''Pulmotor''' - brand name for a device developed in the early 1900s -- was the forerunner of modern [[mechanical ventilator]]s.
