During that time the metric system had undergone a number of changes, particularly in science and engineering. Some industries were based on the CGS variant of the metric system and other on the MKS variant. In 1960, the [[CGPM]] published the [[International System of Units]] (SI), a coherent version of the metric system based on the MKS variant. Directive 71/354/EEC sought to rationalise the system of units within the EEC by standardising on SI.\n\nThe directive catalogued the units of measure that were permitted for [[measuring instrument]]s (for instance scales), [[measurement]]s and indications of quantity expressed in units for economic, public health, public safety and administrative purposes. The catalogue was consistent with the SI standard. The directive explicitly proscribed a number of mainly CGS units of measure that were not to be used after 31 December 1977.\n\nThe directive explicitly exempted member states from having to use those units of measure in the catalogue in situations where other units of measure had been laid down by international intergovernmental conventions or agreements in the field of air and sea transport and rail traffic.\n\n[[Denmark]], Ireland and the United Kingdom joined the EEC in 1973. The directive had little impact in Denmark which was in a similar situation to the other EEC member vis-\u00e0-vis the use of metric units. Ireland and the United Kingdom were in the process of metrication programmes and the directive was consistent with those countries policies as they stood at the time. The three new member states had five years to implement this directive (as well as all other directives that had been published by the EEC).\n\n==Directive 80/181/EEC== \nBy the late 1970s the metrication programme in the United Kingdom had lost momentum. In particular the government had decided to postpone the metrication of road signs. Furthermore, the metrication of trade in many consumer areas had not been completed. The United Kingdom asked the EEC for a derogation to permit the continued use of imperial units. The result was a repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC and its replacement by Directive 80/181/EEC. The principal changes were:\n\n* A number of units that had been proscribed under Directive 71/354/EEC could continue to be used until the end of 1985.\n* A number of imperial units including the [[Pound (mass)|pound]], [[ounce]], yard, foot, inch, [[gallon]] and [[pint]] could continue to be used until the end of 1989.\n* The mile, yard, foot and inch could be used on road traffic signs, distance and speed measurement, pints could be used for the sale of milk in returnable containers and for the measurement of draught beer and cider, acres could be used for purposes of land registration and [[troy ounces]] could be used when dealing with precious metals until a date to be determined by the states in question.\n* Supplementary units were permitted until the end of 1989.\n\n===Amendments=== \n* Directive 85/1/EEC of 18 December 1984<ref>{{cite web | url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31985L0001:EN:NOT | title=Council Directive 89/617/EEC of 27 November 1989 amending Directive 80/181/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement | accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref> was a technical amendment to reflect the change in the definition of the metre and included other minor changes to the catalogue of allowable units.\n* {{anchor|89/617/EEC}} Directive 89/617/EEC of 27 November 1989<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31989L0617:EN:NOT | title = Council Directive 89/617/EEC of 27 November 1989 amending Directive 80/181/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement | accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref> changed the cutoff dates for supplementary units to 31 December 1999 and cutoff dates for those imperial units that were previously allowed were extended to 31 December 1994 for some units and to 31 December 1999 for other units.\n* Directive 1999/103/EC of 24 January 2000<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0103:EN:NOT | title = Directive 1999/103/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 January 2000 amending Council Directive 80/181/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement | accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref> included minor changes to the catalogue of allowable units.

During that time the metric system had undergone a number of changes, particularly in science and engineering. Some industries were based on the CGS variant of the metric system and other on the MKS variant. In 1960, the [[CGPM]] published the [[International System of Units]] (SI), a coherent version of the metric system based on the MKS variant. Directive 71/354/EEC sought to rationalise the system of units within the EEC by standardising on SI.\n\nThe directive catalogued the units of measure that were permitted for [[measuring instrument]]s (for instance scales), [[measurement]]s and indications of quantity expressed in units for economic, public health, public safety and administrative purposes. The catalogue was consistent with the SI standard. The directive explicitly proscribed a number of mainly CGS units of measure that were not to be used after 31 December 1977.\n\nThe directive explicitly exempted member states from having to use those units of measure in the catalogue in situations where other units of measure had been laid down by international intergovernmental conventions or agreements in the field of air and sea transport and rail traffic.\n\n[[Denmark]], Ireland and the United Kingdom joined the EEC in 1973. The directive had little impact in Denmark which was in a similar situation to the other EEC member vis-\u00e0-vis the use of metric units. Ireland and the United Kingdom were in the process of metrication programmes and the directive was consistent with those countries policies as they stood at the time. The three new member states had five years to implement this directive (as well as all other directives that had been published by the EEC).\n\n==Directive 80/181/EEC== \nBy the late 1970s the metrication programme in the United Kingdom had lost momentum. In particular the government had decided to postpone the metrication of road signs. Furthermore, the metrication of trade in many consumer areas had not been completed. The United Kingdom asked the EEC for a derogation to permit the continued use of imperial units. The result was a repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC and its replacement by Directive 80/181/EEC. The principal changes were:\n\n* A number of units that had been proscribed under Directive 71/354/EEC could continue to be used until the end of 1985.\n* A number of imperial units including the [[Pound (mass)|pound]], [[ounce]], yard, foot, inch, [[gallon]] and [[pint]] could continue to be used until the end of 1989.\n* The mile, yard, foot and inch could be used on road traffic signs, distance and speed measurement, pints could be used for the sale of milk in returnable containers and for the measurement of draught beer and cider, acres could be used for purposes of land registration and [[troy ounces]] could be used when dealing with precious metals until a date to be determined by the states in question.\n* Supplementary units were permitted until the end of 1989.\n\n===Amendments=== \n* Directive 85/1/EEC of 18 December 1984<ref>{{cite web | url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31985L0001:EN:NOT | title=Council Directive 89/617/EEC of 27 November 1989 amending Directive 80/181/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement | accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref> was a technical amendment to reflect the change in the definition of the metre and included other minor changes to the catalogue of allowable units.\n* {{anchor|89/617/EEC}} Directive 89/617/EEC of 27 November 1989<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31989L0617:EN:NOT | title = Council Directive 89/617/EEC of 27 November 1989 amending Directive 80/181/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement | accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref> changed the cutoff dates for supplementary units to 31 December 1999 and cutoff dates for those imperial units that were previously allowed were extended to 31 December 1994 for some units and to 31 December 1999 for other units.\n* Directive 1999/103/EC of 24 January 2000<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0103:EN:NOT | title = Directive 1999/103/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 January 2000 amending Council Directive 80/181/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement | accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref> included minor changes to the catalogue of allowable units.

M.C.,  I.D.S.M.,  11th Gorkha  Rifles.(Seconded  to  Assam  Rifles).\n\n''(Effective   date  of  award \u2014 3rd  May 1961)''\n\nIn  April\u2013May  1961, Captain  Man  Bahadur  Rai   (IC-5261)  took  part  in  a series  of  actions  against  a  body  of  hostile  Nagas  who  had  entrenched  themselves  in  a  very  difficult,   densely  wooded,  hilly  region  interspersed  with numerous  ravines.   Towards  the  end  of  April  1961, he  led  a  platoon  at  dead of  night  through  two  hostile  positions  into  the  heart  of  their stronghold, fiercely  attacked  them  and  was  successful  in  dislodging  them  from  that position. On the  3rd  May  1961, he  led  a  platoon  against  another  strongly  fortified hostile  position  which  was  situated  on  the  steep  slopes  of  a   ravine.   This position  dominated  the  surrounding  area  and  could  not  be  approached except  frontally. Captain  Rai,  knowing  that  heavy  casualties  would  result if  he  were  to  attack  frontally,  took  half  a  platoon, crawled  through  the thick  undergrowth  and  scaled  up  the  steep  side  while  exposed  to  a  hail of close  range  fire  which  covered  his  advance.  On  locating  the  hostile position,  he  pressed  forward  in  its  direction,  threw  two  hand  grenades  killing a  few  hostiles  and  charged  the  position  firing  as  he  went  and  killing   two more  hostiles.   This  fearless  and  unexpected  assault  spurred  his  men  to action  and  so  demoralised  the  hostiles  that  they  fled  into  the  thick  jungle. The  hostiles  lost  ten  men  in  the  encounter  and  left  behind  two  rifles, one 12 bore  gun  and  one  tommy  gun.   The  attack  dealt  a  crushing  blow  to  the hostiles  and  led  to  the  eventual  destruction  of  their  position. This  action  was  one  of  several  in  which  Captain  Rai  took  part,   first   as an  officer  of  the  8th  Battalion  of  the  Assam  Rifles  and  more  recently  as  an officer   of  the  Village  Guards  Organisation  of  Nagaland.   Throughout  this period,  he  repeatedly  showed  conspicuous  bravery,  unselfishness  and    indomitable  courage  in  very  difficult  and   dangerous  situations.  His  leader-ship  and  unconquerable  will  have  been  a  source  of  inspiration   to  all   his comrades  and  are  in  the  highest  traditions   of  the  Army.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Later life and death==\nAfter retiring from the Indian Army, Rai settled at Jorhat in Assam. He died there on 14 February 2011, aged 97, and was accorded full military honours by the Assam Rifles at his funeral. The Assam Rifles named an auditorium at their Shillong HQ in honour of Rai.<ref>{{cite news |date=15 February 2011 |title=Last rites of India's oldest-surviving Ashok Chakra recipient held|url=https://www.sify.com/news/last-rites-of-indias-oldest-surviving-ashok-chakra-recipient-held-news-national-lcpuEogcbdasi.html |work=Sify News|location= |access-date=3 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n<center>\n{|\n<center>\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Ashoka Chakra ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=India_General_Service_Medal_1947.svg|width=106}} \n</center>\n|}\n{|\n<center>\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND Samanya Seva medal.svg|width=106}} \n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND_Samar_Seva_Star_Ribbon.svg|width=106}} \n|[[File:IND Raksha Medal Ribbon.svg|100px]]\n|[[File:Indian Independence medal 1947.svg|105px]]\n|-\n|[[File:IND 20YearsServiceMedalRibbon.svg|105px]]\n|[[File:IND 9YearsServiceMedalRibbon.svg|105px]]\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Military_cross_BAR.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Indian_Distinguished_Service_Medal_Ribbon.gif|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Ribbon_-_1939-45_Star.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Ribbon_-_Burma_Star.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Ribbon_-_War_Medal_&_MiD.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Ribbon_India_Service_Medal.png|width=106}}     \n|-\n|}</center>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|<center>Ashoka Chakra</center>\n|<center>[[General Service Medal 1947]]</center>\n|-\n|<center>[[Samanya Seva Medal]]</center>\n|<center>Samar Seva Star</center>\n|<center>Raksha Medal</center>\n|<center>[[Indian Independence Medal]]</center>\n|-\n|<center>20 Years Long Service Medal</center>\n|<center>9 Years Long Service Medal</center>\n|<center>[[Military Cross]]</center>\n|<center>[[Indian Distinguished Service Medal]]</center>\n|-\n|<center>[[1939-45 Star]]</center>\n|<center>[[Burma Star]]</center>\n|<center>[[War Medal 1939-1945]]</center>\n|<center>India Service Medal</center>\n|-\n|}</center>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rai, Man Bahadur}}\n[[Category:1914 births]]\n[[Category:2011 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Darjeeling district]]\n[[Category:British Indian Army officers]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Military Cross]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Indian Distinguished Service Medal]]\n[[Category:Indian Army personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:People of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]]\n[[Category:Military personnel from West Bengal]]\n[[Category:Indian Army personnel]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox military person\n| honorific_prefix = Captain\n| name          = Man Bahadur Rai\n| honorific_suffix = [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|AC]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Indian Distinguished Service Medal|IDSM]]\n| image         = \n| image_size    = \n| caption       = \n| birth_date    = {{Birth date|df=y|1914|01|10}}<ref name=\"recipients\">{{cite book |last1=Aggarwal |first1=Rashmi |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Ashoka Chakra Recipients |location= |pages=173 |publisher=Prabhat Books|isbn= }}</ref>\n| birth_place   = [[Darjeeling district]], [[Bengal Presidency]], [[British Raj]]<br> (present-day [[West Bengal]], India)<ref name=\"recipients\"/>\n| death_date    = {{Death date and age|df=y|2011|02|14|1914|01|10}}\n| death_place   = [[Jorhat]], [[Assam]]\n| serviceyears  = 1930\u201319?\n| nickname      = \n| allegiance    = {{flag|British India}}<br> {{flag|India}}\n| branch        = {{army|British Raj}}<br>{{army|India}}\n| rank          = [[File:Captain of the Indian Army.svg|15px]] [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]]\n| servicenumber = 17249IO (British Indian Army Indian Officer)<br>SS-14842 (short-service commission)<ref name=\"commission\"/><br>IC-5261 (regular commission)<ref name=\"commission\"/>\n| unit          = [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]]<br>[[11th Gorkha Rifles]]<br>[[Assam Rifles]]\n| commands      = \n| battles       =\n*[[World War II]]\n**[[Burma Campaign]]\n*[[Indo-Pakistan War of 1947]]\n*[[Insurgency in Northeast India]]\n| awards        = \n}}\n\n'''Man Bahadur Rai''' [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|AC]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Indian Distinguished Service Medal|IDSM]] (10 January 1914 \u2013 14 February 2011) was a highly decorated [[Indian Army]] Gorkha officer and a recipient of the [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashoka Chakra]], the highest peacetime Indian gallantry decoration.

M.C.,  I.D.S.M.,  11th Gorkha  Rifles.(Seconded  to  Assam  Rifles).\n\n''(Effective   date  of  award \u2014 3rd  May 1961)''\n\nIn  April\u2013May  1961, Captain  Man  Bahadur  Rai   (IC-5261)  took  part  in  a series  of  actions  against  a  body  of  hostile  Nagas  who  had  entrenched  themselves  in  a  very  difficult,   densely  wooded,  hilly  region  interspersed  with numerous  ravines.   Towards  the  end  of  April  1961, he  led  a  platoon  at  dead of  night  through  two  hostile  positions  into  the  heart  of  their stronghold, fiercely  attacked  them  and  was  successful  in  dislodging  them  from  that position. On the  3rd  May  1961, he  led  a  platoon  against  another  strongly  fortified hostile  position  which  was  situated  on  the  steep  slopes  of  a   ravine.   This position  dominated  the  surrounding  area  and  could  not  be  approached except  frontally. Captain  Rai,  knowing  that  heavy  casualties  would  result if  he  were  to  attack  frontally,  took  half  a  platoon, crawled  through  the thick  undergrowth  and  scaled  up  the  steep  side  while  exposed  to  a  hail of close  range  fire  which  covered  his  advance.  On  locating  the  hostile position,  he  pressed  forward  in  its  direction,  threw  two  hand  grenades  killing a  few  hostiles  and  charged  the  position  firing  as  he  went  and  killing   two more  hostiles.   This  fearless  and  unexpected  assault  spurred  his  men  to action  and  so  demoralised  the  hostiles  that  they  fled  into  the  thick  jungle. The  hostiles  lost  ten  men  in  the  encounter  and  left  behind  two  rifles, one 12 bore  gun  and  one  tommy  gun.   The  attack  dealt  a  crushing  blow  to  the hostiles  and  led  to  the  eventual  destruction  of  their  position. This  action  was  one  of  several  in  which  Captain  Rai  took  part,   first   as an  officer  of  the  8th  Battalion  of  the  Assam  Rifles  and  more  recently  as  an officer   of  the  Village  Guards  Organisation  of  Nagaland.   Throughout  this period,  he  repeatedly  showed  conspicuous  bravery,  unselfishness  and    indomitable  courage  in  very  difficult  and   dangerous  situations.  His  leader-ship  and  unconquerable  will  have  been  a  source  of  inspiration   to  all   his comrades  and  are  in  the  highest  traditions   of  the  Army.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Later life and death==\nAfter retiring from the Indian Army, Rai settled at Jorhat in Assam. He died there on 14 February 2011, aged 97, and was accorded full military honours by the Assam Rifles at his funeral. The Assam Rifles named an auditorium at their Shillong HQ in honour of Rai.<ref>{{cite news |date=15 February 2011 |title=Last rites of India's oldest-surviving Ashok Chakra recipient held|url=https://www.sify.com/news/last-rites-of-indias-oldest-surviving-ashok-chakra-recipient-held-news-national-lcpuEogcbdasi.html |work=Sify News|location= |access-date=3 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n<center>\n{|\n<center>\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Ashoka Chakra ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=India_General_Service_Medal_1947.svg|width=106}} \n</center>\n|}\n{|\n<center>\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND Samanya Seva medal.svg|width=106}} \n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=IND_Samar_Seva_Star_Ribbon.svg|width=106}} \n|[[File:IND Raksha Medal Ribbon.svg|100px]]\n|[[File:Indian Independence medal 1947.svg|105px]]\n|-\n|[[File:IND 20YearsServiceMedalRibbon.svg|105px]]\n|[[File:IND 9YearsServiceMedalRibbon.svg|105px]]\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Military_cross_BAR.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Indian_Distinguished_Service_Medal_Ribbon.gif|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Ribbon_-_1939-45_Star.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Ribbon_-_Burma_Star.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Ribbon_-_War_Medal_&_MiD.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Ribbon_India_Service_Medal.png|width=106}}     \n|-\n|}</center>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|<center>Ashoka Chakra</center>\n|<center>[[General Service Medal 1947]]</center>\n|-\n|<center>[[Samanya Seva Medal]]</center>\n|<center>Samar Seva Star</center>\n|<center>Raksha Medal</center>\n|<center>[[Indian Independence Medal]]</center>\n|-\n|<center>20 Years Long Service Medal</center>\n|<center>9 Years Long Service Medal</center>\n|<center>[[Military Cross]]</center>\n|<center>[[Indian Distinguished Service Medal]]</center>\n|-\n|<center>[[1939-45 Star]]</center>\n|<center>[[Burma Star]]</center>\n|<center>[[War Medal 1939-1945]]</center>\n|<center>India Service Medal</center>\n|-\n|}</center>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rai, Man Bahadur}}\n[[Category:1914 births]]\n[[Category:2011 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Darjeeling district]]\n[[Category:British Indian Army officers]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Military Cross]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Indian Distinguished Service Medal]]\n[[Category:Indian Army personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:People of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]]\n[[Category:Military personnel from West Bengal]]\n[[Category:Indian Army personnel]]\n", "name_user": "Koushik Pain", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Bahadur_Rai"}

PDMS is optically clear, and, in general, inert, non-[[Toxicity|toxic]], and non-[[Flammability|flammable]]. It is one of several types of [[silicone oil]] ([[polymer]]ized [[siloxane]]). Its applications range from contact lenses and medical devices to [[elastomer]]s; it is also present in shampoos (as dimethicone makes hair shiny and slippery), food (antifoaming agent), [[caulking]], [[lubricant]]s and heat-resistant tiles.\n\n==Structure==\nThe [[chemical formula]] for PDMS is CH<sub>3</sub>[Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O]<sub>''n''</sub>Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, where ''n'' is the number of repeating [[monomer]] [SiO(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] units.<ref name=West>Mark, J. E.; Allcock, H. R.; West, R. \u201cInorganic Polymers\u201d Prentice Hall, Englewood, NJ: 1992. {{ISBN|0-13-465881-7}}.</ref> Industrial synthesis can begin from [[dimethyldichlorosilane]] and water by the following net reaction:\n:<math chem>n\\ce{Si(CH3)2Cl2} + (n+1)\\ce{H2O -> HO[-Si(CH3)2O-]_\\mathit{n}H} + 2n\\ce{HCl}</math>\nThe polymerization reaction evolves [[hydrochloric acid]]. For medical and domestic applications, a process was developed in which the [[chlorine]] atoms in the [[silane]] precursor were replaced with [[acetate]] groups.  In this case, the polymerization produces [[acetic acid]], which is less chemically aggressive than HCl. As a side-effect, the curing process is also much slower in this case. The acetate is used in consumer applications, such as silicone [[caulk]] and [[adhesive]]s.\n\n===Branching and capping===\nHydrolysis of  Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> generates a polymer that is terminated with [[silanol]] groups (-Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OH]).  These reactive centers are typically \"capped\" by reaction with [[trimethylsilyl chloride]]:\n:2 Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl  +  [Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O]<sub>{{mvar|n}}-2</sub>[Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OH]<sub>2</sub>   \u2192   [Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O]<sub>{{mvar|n}}-2</sub>[Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub> + 2 HCl\n\nSilane precursors with more acid-forming groups and fewer methyl groups, such as [[methyltrichlorosilane]], can be used to introduce [[Branching (chemistry)|branches]] or [[cross-link]]s in the polymer chain. Under ideal conditions, each molecule of such a compound becomes a branch point. This can be used to produce hard [[silicone resin]]s. In a similar manner, precursors with three methyl groups can be used to limit molecular weight, since each such molecule has only one reactive site and so forms the end of a siloxane chain.\n\nWell-defined PDMS with a low polydispersity index and high homogeneity is produced by controlled anionic ring-opening polymerization of [[hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane]]. Using this methodology it is possible to synthesize linear block copolymers, heteroarm star-shaped block copolymers and many other macromolecular architectures.\n\nThe polymer is manufactured in multiple [[viscosity|viscosities]], ranging from a thin pourable liquid (when ''n'' is very low), to a thick rubbery semi-solid (when ''n'' is very high). PDMS [[molecule]]s have quite flexible polymer backbones (or chains) due to their siloxane linkages, which are analogous to the [[ether]] linkages used to impart rubberiness to [[polyurethane]]s. Such flexible chains become loosely entangled when [[molecular weight]] is high, which results in PDMS' unusually high level of [[viscoelasticity]].\n\n==Mechanical properties==\nPDMS is [[viscoelastic]], meaning that at long flow times (or high temperatures), it acts like a [[Viscosity|viscous liquid]], similar to honey. However, at short flow times (or low temperatures), it acts like an [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[solid]], similar to rubber. Viscoelasticity is a form of nonlinear elasticity that is common amongst noncrystalline polymers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mechanical Behavior of Materials|last=Courtney, Thomas H.|date=2013|publisher=McGraw Hill Education (India)|isbn=978-1259027512|oclc=929663641}}</ref> The loading and unloading of a stress-strain curve for PDMS do not coincide; rather, the amount of stress will vary based on the degree of strain, and the general rule is that increasing strain will result in greater stiffness. When the load itself is removed, the strain is slowly recovered (rather than instantaneously). This time-dependent elastic deformation results from the long-chains of the polymer. But the process that is described above is only relevant when cross-linking is present; when it is not, the polymer PDMS cannot shift back to the original state even when the load is removed, resulting in a permanent deformation. However, permanent deformation is rarely seen in PDMS, since it is almost always cured with a cross-linking agent. \u00a0\n\nIf some PDMS is left on a surface overnight (long flow time), it will flow to cover the surface and mold to any surface imperfections. However, if the same PDMS is poured into a spherical mold and allowed to cure (short flow time), it will bounce like a rubber ball.<ref name=\"West\" /> The mechanical properties of PDMS enable this polymer to conform to a diverse amount of surfaces. Since these properties are affected by a variety of factors, this unique polymer is relatively easy to tune. This enables PDMS to become a good substrate that can easily be integrated into a variety of microfluidic and microelectromechanical systems.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"pdms_review\" /> Specifically, the determination of mechanical properties can be decided before PDMS is cured; the uncured version allows the user to capitalize on myriad opportunities for achieving a desirable elastomer. \nGenerally, the cross-linked cured version of PDMS resembles rubber in a solidified form. It is widely known to be easily stretched, bent, compressed in all directions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Polydimethylsiloxane Mechanical Properties Measured by Macroscopic Compression and Nanoindentation Techniques|last=Wang, Zhixin.|date=2011|oclc=778367553}}</ref> Depending on the application and field, the user is able to tune the properties based on what is demanded. \n[[File:FabricwithinPDMS.jpg|thumb|Fabric embedded within PDMS.

The oxidized surface can be further functionalized by reaction with trichlorosilanes.

With this type of technique, it is possible to produce devices that can be used in the areas of optic telecommunications or biomedical research. The stamp is produced from the normal techniques of [[photolithography]] or [[electron-beam lithography]]. The resolution depends on the mask used and can reach 6&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{cite book |last = Waldner |first = Jean-Baptiste | author-link = Jean-Baptiste Waldner |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = John Wiley & Sons|place = London |year = 2008|pages = 92\u201393 |isbn = 978-1-84704-002-2}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Bio-MEMS|biomedical (or biological) microelectromechanical systems]] (bio-MEMS), soft lithography is used extensively for microfluidics in both organic and inorganic contexts. Silicon wafers are used to design channels, and PDMS is then poured over these wafers and left to harden. When removed, even the smallest of details is left imprinted in the PDMS. With this particular PDMS block, hydrophilic surface modification is conducted using [[Plasma etcher|plasma etching]] techniques. Plasma treatment disrupts surface silicon-oxygen bonds, and a plasma-treated glass slide is usually placed on the activated side of the PDMS (the plasma-treated, now hydrophilic side with imprints). Once activation wears off and bonds begin to reform, silicon-oxygen bonds are formed between the surface atoms of the glass and the surface atoms of the PDMS, and the slide becomes permanently sealed to the PDMS, thus creating a waterproof channel.

PDMS is optically clear, and, in general, inert, non-[[Toxicity|toxic]], and non-[[Flammability|flammable]]. It is one of several types of [[silicone oil]] ([[polymer]]ized [[siloxane]]). Its applications range from contact lenses and medical devices to [[elastomer]]s; it is also present in shampoos (as dimethicone makes hair shiny and slippery), food (antifoaming agent), [[caulking]], [[lubricant]]s and heat-resistant tiles.\n\n==Structure==\nThe [[chemical formula]] for PDMS is CH<sub>3</sub>[Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O]<sub>''n''</sub>Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, where ''n'' is the number of repeating [[monomer]] [SiO(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] units.<ref name=West>Mark, J.

For medical and domestic applications, a process was developed in which the [[chlorine]] atoms in the [[silane]] precursor were replaced with [[acetate]] groups.  In this case, the polymerization produces [[acetic acid]], which is less chemically aggressive than HCl. As a side-effect, the curing process is also much slower in this case. The acetate is used in consumer applications, such as silicone [[caulk]] and [[adhesive]]s.\n\n===Branching and capping===\nHydrolysis of  Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> generates a polymer that is terminated with [[silanol]] groups (-Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OH]).  These reactive centers are typically \"capped\" by reaction with [[trimethylsilyl chloride]]:\n:2 Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl  +  [Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O]<sub>{{mvar|n}}-2</sub>[Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OH]<sub>2</sub>   \u2192   [Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O]<sub>{{mvar|n}}-2</sub>[Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub> + 2 HCl\n\nSilane precursors with more acid-forming groups and fewer methyl groups, such as [[methyltrichlorosilane]], can be used to introduce [[Branching (chemistry)|branches]] or [[cross-link]]s in the polymer chain. Under ideal conditions, each molecule of such a compound becomes a branch point. This can be used to produce hard [[silicone resin]]s. In a similar manner, precursors with three methyl groups can be used to limit molecular weight, since each such molecule has only one reactive site and so forms the end of a siloxane chain.\n\nWell-defined PDMS with a low polydispersity index and high homogeneity is produced by controlled anionic ring-opening polymerization of [[hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane]]. Using this methodology it is possible to synthesize linear block copolymers, heteroarm star-shaped block copolymers and many other macromolecular architectures.\n\nThe polymer is manufactured in multiple [[viscosity|viscosities]], ranging from a thin pourable liquid (when ''n'' is very low), to a thick rubbery semi-solid (when ''n'' is very high). PDMS [[molecule]]s have quite flexible polymer backbones (or chains) due to their siloxane linkages, which are analogous to the [[ether]] linkages used to impart rubberiness to [[polyurethane]]s. Such flexible chains become loosely entangled when [[molecular weight]] is high, which results in PDMS' unusually high level of [[viscoelasticity]].\n\n==Mechanical properties==\nPDMS is [[viscoelastic]], meaning that at long flow times (or high temperatures), it acts like a [[Viscosity|viscous liquid]], similar to honey. However, at short flow times (or low temperatures), it acts like an [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[solid]], similar to rubber. Viscoelasticity is a form of nonlinear elasticity that is common amongst noncrystalline polymers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mechanical Behavior of Materials|last=Courtney, Thomas H.|date=2013|publisher=McGraw Hill Education (India)|isbn=978-1259027512|oclc=929663641}}</ref> The loading and unloading of a stress-strain curve for PDMS do not coincide; rather, the amount of stress will vary based on the degree of strain, and the general rule is that increasing strain will result in greater stiffness. When the load itself is removed, the strain is slowly recovered (rather than instantaneously). This time-dependent elastic deformation results from the long-chains of the polymer. But the process that is described above is only relevant when cross-linking is present; when it is not, the polymer PDMS cannot shift back to the original state even when the load is removed, resulting in a permanent deformation. However, permanent deformation is rarely seen in PDMS, since it is almost always cured with a cross-linking agent. \u00a0\n\nIf some PDMS is left on a surface overnight (long flow time), it will flow to cover the surface and mold to any surface imperfections. However, if the same PDMS is poured into a spherical mold and allowed to cure (short flow time), it will bounce like a rubber ball.<ref name=\"West\" /> The mechanical properties of PDMS enable this polymer to conform to a diverse amount of surfaces. Since these properties are affected by a variety of factors, this unique polymer is relatively easy to tune. This enables PDMS to become a good substrate that can easily be integrated into a variety of microfluidic and microelectromechanical systems.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"pdms_review\" /> Specifically, the determination of mechanical properties can be decided before PDMS is cured; the uncured version allows the user to capitalize on myriad opportunities for achieving a desirable elastomer. \nGenerally, the cross-linked cured version of PDMS resembles rubber in a solidified form. It is widely known to be easily stretched, bent, compressed in all directions. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Polydimethylsiloxane Mechanical Properties Measured by Macroscopic Compression and Nanoindentation Techniques|last=Wang, Zhixin.|date=2011|oclc=778367553}}</ref>Depending on the application and field, the user is able to tune the properties based on what is demanded. \n[[File:FabricwithinPDMS.jpg|thumb|Fabric embedded within PDMS.

However most [[Organic compound|organic]] solvents will [[Diffusion|diffuse]] into the material and cause it to swell.<ref name=\"pdms_review\" /> Despite this, some organic solvents lead to sufficiently small swelling that they can be used with PDMS, for instance within the channels of PDMS microfluidic devices. The swelling ratio is roughly inversely related to the [[solubility|solubility parameter]] of the solvent. [[Diisopropylamine]] swells PDMS to the greatest extent; solvents such as [[chloroform]], [[ether]], and [[THF]] swell the material to a large extent. Solvents such as [[acetone]], [[1-propanol]], and [[pyridine]] swell the material to a small extent. Alcohols and polar solvents such as [[methanol]], [[glycerol]] and water do not swell the material appreciably.<ref name=\"solvent_review\">{{cite journal|author1=Lee, J.

With this type of technique, it is possible to produce devices that can be used in the areas of optic telecommunications or biomedical research. The stamp is produced from the normal techniques of [[photolithography]] or [[electron-beam lithography]]. The resolution depends on the mask used and can reach 6&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{cite book |last = Waldner |first = Jean-Baptiste | author-link = Jean-Baptiste Waldner |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = John Wiley & Sons|place = London |year = 2008|pages = 92\u201393 |isbn = 978-1-84704-002-2}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Bio-MEMS|biomedical (or biological) microelectromechanical systems]] (bio-MEMS), soft lithography is used extensively for microfluidics in both organic and inorganic contexts. Silicon wafers are used to design channels, and PDMS is then poured over these wafers and left to harden. When removed, even the smallest of details is left imprinted in the PDMS. With this particular PDMS block, hydrophilic surface modification is conducted using [[Plasma etcher|plasma etching]] techniques. Plasma treatment disrupts surface silicon-oxygen bonds, and a plasma-treated glass slide is usually placed on the activated side of the PDMS (the plasma-treated, now hydrophilic side with imprints). Once activation wears off and bonds begin to reform, silicon-oxygen bonds are formed between the surface atoms of the glass and the surface atoms of the PDMS, and the slide becomes permanently sealed to the PDMS, thus creating a waterproof channel. With these devices, researchers can utilize various surface chemistry techniques for different functions creating unique lab-on-a-chip devices for rapid parallel testing.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1369-7021(05)00702-9 | last1 = Rogers | first1 = J.

His death became a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' among those campaigning against [[bullying]] in [[military training]] regimes. As a result of his death a number of procedures and guidelines within the Navy's training programs were changed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Paul L.|date=June 26, 1991|title=Navy Training Safety: High-Risk Training Can be Safer|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/160/150706.pdf|journal=United States General Accounting Office|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>  He is cited by name in the Navy documentation supporting these changes.\n\n==Background==\nBoot Camp - Lee completed boot camp from Orlando Florida company C246.  This tragedy started before his entry in SAR school.   During basic swimming tests, it became clear to everyone that Lee was afraid of the water.  It took at least 5 tries to get him to pass the tread water requirements.   The company commander, BMC Treacy kept commenting \"and you are going to be a rescue swimmer my a**.   Lee told me, his rack mate, that he was terrified of the water and knew he would \"never\" make it to the Rescue Swimmer and would have to reclass.\n\nRescue Swimmer School (RSS) was a compulsory part of the training for this role.  This demanding training was developed to prepare recruits for retrieving downed aircraft carrier-based airmen under wartime conditions.  Recruits must be in peak physical condition, and the course has a 50% attrition rate.  The basic swimming skills of distance and time are tested while the student goes through Recruit Training (boot camp) and those that fail lose their guaranteed job skill training and go to the naval fleet as \"Apprentices\" with no technical jobs skills.\n\nAs part of the RSS program, recruits must successfully complete a drill known as ''sharks and daisies''. In this drill, students swim in a circle with their hands behind their backs, equipped with flippers but no safety apparatus.  Instructors take a (head) hold on the student and attempt to simulate panicking victims in need of rescue. A student failing to perform the release maneuver correctly is given additional instruction.\n\nRSS allowed for \"drop on request\" (DOR), which Mirecki had already done once, in February 1988, following failure to complete the \"sharks and daisies\" drill.  He underwent a series of physical and psychological exams and was placed on \"medical hold.\"  It is alleged that pressure from RSS instructors was behind his decision to return to the RSS program when he did.  The RSS instructors may have reminded Mirecki that his DOR request would cost him his technical skill training and send him to the naval fleet as an undesignated seaman assigned to the ship's deck force.\n\n===Mirecki's death===\nMirecki, from [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], joined the Navy in 1987. At the time of his death he was training to become an Aviation Anti-Submarine Warfare Operator (AW) Rescue Swimmer, despite a childhood fear of being under water.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-29/news/mn-5279_1_navy-swimming|title=Navy Recruit's Drowning: Chilling Tale of Determination, Terror|last=MOORE|first=MOLLY|date=1988-05-29|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-01-23|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> According to reports, at least two of the instructors on duty that day were aware of Mirecki's earlier problem with the drill.

The Officer-In-Charge of the RSS and the primary instructor involved in the incident were reportedly{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} disciplined within the Navy [[Judiciary|judicial system]].\n\n===US Navy response===\nThe Navy did not begin an investigation until a reporter from the ''[[Pensacola News Journal]]'' received an anonymous tip with information and reason to investigate the incident. When the management of the newspaper refused to publish the reporter's account, the reporter quit her job at the newspaper. The family then contacted [[Member of Congress|members of Congress]] and the [[news media|press]]. After two months of media, family, and Congressional pressure, the Navy began an investigation, determined that there was a case to answer, and disciplined both the primary instructor involved<ref name=\":0\" /> and the school's Officer In Charge. However, there were no court martial.\n\n===Legal actions===\nOn January 25, 1990, Mirecki's mother, Elaine Kitowski, as [[personal representative]] of her son's [[Estate (law)|estate]], filed a wrongful death action under the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]].

His death became a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' among those campaigning against [[bullying]] in [[military training]] regimes. As a result of his death a number of procedures and guidelines within the Navy's training programs were changed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Paul L.|date=June 26, 1991|title=Navy Training Safety: High-Risk Training Can be Safer|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/160/150706.pdf|journal=United States General Accounting Office|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>  He is cited by name in the Navy documentation supporting these changes.\n\n==Background==\nBoot Camp - Lee completed boot camp from Orlando Florida company C246.  This tragedy started before his entry in SAR school.   During basic swimming tests, it became clear to everyone that Lee was afraid of the water.  It took at least 5 tries to get him to pass the tread water requirements.   The company commander, BMC Treacy kept commenting \"and you are going to be a rescue swimmer my a**.   Lee told me, his rack mate, that he was terrified of the water and knew he would \"never\" make it to the Rescue Swimmer and would have to reclass.\n\nRescue Swimmer School (RSS) was a compulsory part of the training for this role.  This demanding training was developed to prepare recruits for retrieving downed aircraft carrier-based airmen under wartime conditions.  Recruits must be in peak physical condition, and the course has a 50% attrition rate.  The basic swimming skills of distance and time are tested while the student goes through Recruit Training (boot camp) and those that fail lose their guaranteed job skill training and go to the naval fleet as \"Apprentices\" with no technical jobs skills.\n\nAs part of the RSS program, recruits must successfully complete a drill known as ''sharks and daisies''. In this drill, students swim in a circle with their hands behind their backs, equipped with flippers but no safety apparatus.  Instructors take a (head) hold on the student and attempt to simulate panicking victims in need of rescue. A student failing to perform the release maneuver correctly is given additional instruction.\n\nRSS allowed for \"drop on request\" (DOR), which Mirecki had already done once, in February 1988, following failure to complete the \"sharks and daisies\" drill.  He underwent a series of physical and psychological exams and was placed on \"medical hold.\"  It is alleged that pressure from RSS instructors was behind his decision to return to the RSS program when he did.  The RSS instructors may have reminded Mirecki that his DOR request would cost him his technical skill training and send him to the naval fleet as an undesignated seaman assigned to the ship's deck force.\n\n===Mirecki's death===\nMirecki, from [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], joined the Navy in 1987. At the time of his death he was training to become an Aviation Anti-Submarine Warfare Operator (AW) Rescue Swimmer, despite a childhood fear of being under water.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-29/news/mn-5279_1_navy-swimming|title=Navy Recruit's Drowning: Chilling Tale of Determination, Terror|last=MOORE|first=MOLLY|date=1988-05-29|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-01-23|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> According to reports, at least two of the instructors on duty that day were aware of Mirecki's earlier problem with the drill. Once again, Mirecki had difficulty with the drill and requested that he be dropped from the course and not be forced to re-enter the pool. Instead of honoring his request, the instructors reportedly seized him and forced him back into the water, then began \"smurfing\" him (holding him under the water) until he lost consciousness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=So Others May Live: Coast Guard's Rescue Swimmers: Saving Lives, Defying Death|last=Laguardia-Kotite|first=Martha J.|publisher=Lyons Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1592289318|location=Guilford, Connecticut|pages=36}}</ref> At this time, other recruits were commanded to line up, turn their backs and sing the national anthem.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/24/us/navy-instructor-found-guilty-in-recruit-s-drowning-death.html|title=Navy Instructor Found Guilty In Recruit's Drowning Death|last=Ap|date=1988-09-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-01-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nMirecki died from a heart arrhythmia, [[ventricular fibrillation]], secondary to [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], consistent with a death by drowning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1988-09-29-8802250804-story.html|title='SYSTEM' GUILTY IN RECRUIT'S DEATH|last=Sun-Sentinel|first=South Florida|date=September 29, 1988|website=Sun-Sentinel.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Mirecki case resulted in increased safety awareness during training in several Navy training programs.  The Officer-In-Charge of the RSS and the primary instructor involved in the incident were reportedly{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} disciplined within the Navy [[Judiciary|judicial system]].\n\n===US Navy response===\nThe Navy did not begin an investigation until a reporter from the ''[[Pensacola News Journal]]'' received an anonymous tip with information and reason to investigate the incident. When the management of the newspaper refused to publish the reporter's account, the reporter quit her job at the newspaper. The family then contacted [[Member of Congress|members of Congress]] and the [[news media|press]]. After two months of media, family, and Congressional pressure, the Navy began an investigation, determined that there was a case to answer, and disciplined both the primary instructor involved<ref name=\":0\" /> and the school's Officer In Charge. However, there were no court martial.\n\n===Legal actions===\nOn January 25, 1990, Mirecki's mother, Elaine Kitowski, as [[personal representative]] of her son's [[Estate (law)|estate]], filed a wrongful death action under the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]]. The court dismissed the suit and held that the claim was barred under the [[FTCA]].

Up until April 4, 2008, not a single Western Conference team had secured a playoff spot, and the 8th-seeded team was a mere 6.5 games behind the 1st seed. Additionally, the quality of the teams ensured that the [[2007\u201308 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] finished with the highest winning percentage of any non-playoff team in NBA history since the switch to the eight-team playoff format, beating out the [[2000\u201301 Houston Rockets season|2000\u201301 Houston Rockets]].
