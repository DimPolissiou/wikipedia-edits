The Monarch was represented in South Africa by a [[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa|Governor-General]]. South Africa became a republic under the [[South African Constitution of 1961|Constitution of 1961]] and the Monarch and Governor-General were replaced by a ceremonial [[State President of South Africa|State President]]. In 1984, under the [[South African Constitution of 1983|Tricameral Constitution]], the State President gained executive powers, becoming head of both state and government. Since 1994, under the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa|Interim Constitution]] and the current [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]], the head of state and government has been called the [[President of South Africa|President]].\n\n==Presidents==\nDuring the early 1800s, many Dutch settlers departed from the [[Cape Colony]], where they had been subjected to British control. They migrated to the future [[Natal Province|Natal]], [[Orange Free State]], and [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] regions. The Boers founded the [[Boer Republics]]: the [[South African Republic]] (now Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and [[North West (South African province)|North West]] provinces), the [[Natalia Republic]] (KwaZulu-Natal), and the Orange Free State (Free State).\n\n===State Presidents of the South African Republic (1857\u20131902)===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:99%;text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| Name<br />{{small|(Birth\u2013Death)}}\n!

The Monarch was represented in South Africa by a [[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa|Governor-General]]. South Africa became a republic under the [[South African Constitution of 1961|Constitution of 1961]] and the Monarch and Governor-General were replaced by a ceremonial [[State President of South Africa|State President]]. In 1984, under the [[South African Constitution of 1983|Tricameral Constitution]], the State President gained executive powers, becoming head of both state and government. Since 1994, under the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa|Interim Constitution]] and the current [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]], the head of state and government has been called the [[President of South Africa|President]].\n\n==Presidents==\nDuring the early 1800s, many Dutch settlers departed from the [[Cape Colony]], where they had been subjected to British control. They migrated to the future [[Natal]], [[Orange Free State]], and [[Transvaal]] regions.

{"title_page": "Thomas Mortimer", "text_new": "{{for|the English writer|Thomas Mortimer (writer)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n'''Sir Thomas Mortimer''' (c. 1350\u20131399) was a medieval English soldier and statesman who served briefly in several important administrative and judicial state offices in [[Ireland]] and played a part in the opposition to the government of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. He was an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] member of the [[Mortimer#Medieval magnates|Mortimer family]], who  were one of the leading noble houses in England and Ireland, and he helped to manage the Mortimer  lands during the minority of the family heir, his nephew [[Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March|Roger, earl of March]]. Sir Thomas was also a close associate of the [[Lords Appellant]] who opposed the administration  of King Richard II.\n\nSir Thomas took part in the appellants' rebellion in 1387 against the king, and fought at the [[Battle of Radcot Bridge]], during which he killed Sir Thomas Molineux, one of the royal commanders. 10 years later, when the king took his revenge against the rebels, this act ultimately led to his conviction for [[treason]]. He fled for his life and died in [[exile]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Conte de la Marsche.jpg|thumb|150px|Thomas's father, Roger, 2nd Earl of March]]\n\nThomas was an illegitimate son of [[Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March]] (1328\u20131360).{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=56}} He was described as an esquire in 1367, pointing to a birth date of  around 1350.{{sfn|Isaacson|1913|p=54}} He seems to have been treated by his father and  his brother very much as one of the family. Nothing is known of his mother. By 1380 he had acquired considerable military expertise, and had been [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]]. When his legitimate brother [[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March]] was made [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] in 1379, Thomas went with him to Ireland and acted as his Deputy, holding in his name a Great Council at [[Clonmel]].{{sfn|Otway-Ruthven|1968|p=315}} Edmund was charged with the task of subduing the Gaelic clans in [[Ulster]] and [[Munster]], but he had only limited success in this task.\n\n==Lord Deputy of Ireland==\nEdmund's sudden death in December 1381 left the [[Dublin]] Government in a quandary, since there were very few men willing  or qualified to assume the office of Lord Lieutenant, at a time of exceptional political turbulence in Ireland. Richard Wyre, [[Bishop of Cloyne]], proposed that Thomas Mortimer should be appointed Lord Lieutenant, both for his military experience and his ability to retain the loyalty of his brother's [[retinue]].{{sfn|Otway-Ruthven|1968|pp=315\u20136}} In the event King [[Richard II]] appointed Thomas's nephew, [[Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March]], a child of seven, as Lord Lieutenant.  The absurdity of this choice was lessened to some extent by the appointment of Thomas as Lord Deputy and [[Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench for Ireland|Lord Chief Justice]].{{sfn|Otway-Ruthven|1968|p=316}}\n\n==Return to England==\nOn the appointment of Sir [[Philip Courtenay (died 1406)|Philip Courtenay]] as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in February 1383, Thomas returned to England. His nephew's [[wardship]] had been entrusted to a group of magnates which included [[Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel]], of whom Thomas was an intimate friend. It was probably Arundel who appointed Thomas to the position of steward of the Mortimer estates during Roger's minority, thus greatly enhancing his political standing.{{sfn|Dunn|2002|p=162}} As Roger grew older he and his uncle became close, going hunting together and exchanging gifts of wine: Dunn suggests that Thomas was the closest Roger ever knew to a father.{{sfn|Dunn|2002|p=164}}\n\n==The Appellants==\nArundel was a  key member of the group of nobles called the [[Lords Appellant]], who had emerged as opponents of Richard II and the royal favourite [[Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland]]. Mortimer was closely associated with them and is known to have visited Arundel's house regularly during 1387, the critical year in the Appellants' rise to power.\n\n===The Battle of Radcot Bridge===\n{{main|Battle of Radcot Bridge}}\n\nIn December 1387, at [[Radcot Bridge]], the Appellants clashed with the royal army, headed by Robert de Vere and Sir Thomas Molineux, Constable of [[Chester Castle]]; de Vere was defeated and forced to flee the country.  Mortimer himself killed Molineux,  who was one of the few casualties of the fight.{{sfn|Dunn|2002|p=162}} According to [[Thomas Walsingham]], Molineux, who had attempted to flee, pleaded for his life, but Mortimer pulled off Molinuex's [[helmet]] and stabbed him in the head with a [[dagger]].{{sfn|Gillespie|1975|p=163}}\n\n[[Image:Robert de Vere fleeing Radcot Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Robert de Vere fleeing after the defeat at Radcot Bridge]]\n\nDuring the brief rule of the Appellants, Mortimer was in high favour. He was appointed Justiciar of Ireland, but Richard, despite his temporary loss of power, somehow managed to countermand the appointment (no doubt he feared to surrender control of Ireland entirely to his enemies) and it never took effect. Despite the King's mistrust of them,  Thomas and his nephew Roger, with troops, accompanied him on his Irish expedition in 1394;{{sfn|Otway-Ruthven|1968|p=326}} and when Roger was reappointed Lord Lieutenant in 1396, Thomas went to Ireland with him.\n\n==Downfall==\nIn 1397 the King at last moved to destroy the surviving Lords Appellant.  Arundel, Mortimer's patron, was convicted of treason and executed. Mortimer was \"appealed for\" (i.e. charged with) treason, in that his killing of Molineux, the King's commander ten years earlier was deemed in law to be an attempt to murder the King himself. Mortimer was not permitted to stand trial, but ordered to surrender himself within three months. Unsurprisingly Mortimer instead chose to flee the country: the King accused Roger, probably with good reason, of conniving at his uncle's escape.{{sfn|Otway-Ruthven|1968|p=337}} Thomas was declared a traitor and his lands were forfeited to the Crown. He took refuge in [[Scotland]] where he died in 1399.{{sfn|Given-Wilson|2016|p=45 n. 41}}\n\n==Marriage==\nHe married Agnes de Poynings, daughter of [[Michael de Poynings, 2nd Baron Poynings]], and widow of [[William Bardolf, 4th Baron Bardolf]]. They had no children. She was described as a widow on 9 January 1403, indicating that Sir Thomas Mortimer was dead by then.{{sfn|Nicolas|1826|p=162}}\n\n==Character==\nAlthough the details (if they were accurately reported) of his killing of Molineux show him in a rather sinister light, Mortimer had the respect and esteem of many who knew him, including his brother and his nephew.

Lucas, \"The G\u00f6delian Argument\"]</ref>\n# [[Determinism]] \u2194 For any human ''h'' there exists at least one (deterministic) [[logical system]] ''L''(''h'') which reliably predicts ''h'''s actions in all circumstances.\n# For any logical system ''L'' a sufficiently skilled [[mathematical logic]]ian (equipped with a sufficiently powerful computer if necessary) can construct some statements ''T''(''L'') which are true but unprovable in ''L''. (This follows from G\u00f6del's first theorem.) \n# If a human ''m'' is a sufficiently skillful mathematical logician (equipped with a sufficiently powerful computer if necessary) then if ''m'' is given ''L''(''m''), he or she can construct ''T''(''L''(''m'')) and determine that they are true\u2014which ''L''(''m'') cannot do.\n# Hence ''L''(''m'') does not reliably predict ''m'''s actions in all circumstances.\n# Hence ''m'' has [[free will]].\n# It is implausible that the qualitative difference between mathematical logicians and the rest of the population is such that the former have free will and the latter do not.\n\nHis argument was strengthened by the discovery by [[Hava Siegelmann]] in the 1990s that sufficiently complex analogue recurrent neural networks are equivalent to [[Turing Machine]]s.<ref>H.T.

He spent the 1957\u201358 academic year at [[Princeton University]], studying mathematics and logic. For 36 years, until his 1996 retirement, he was a Fellow and Tutor of [[Merton College, Oxford]], and he remains an emeritus member of the University Faculty of Philosophy. He is a Fellow of the [[British Academy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/fellows/john-lucas-FBA|title=Mr John Lucas|website=The British Academy|language=en|access-date=2019-05-11}}</ref>\n\nLucas is perhaps best known for his paper \"[[Minds, Machines and G\u00f6del]],\" arguing that an [[Turing machine|automaton]] cannot represent a human mathematician, essentially refuting [[computationalism]].\n\nAn author with diverse teaching and research interests, Lucas has written on the [[philosophy of mathematics]], especially the implications of [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]], the [[philosophy of mind]], [[free will and determinism]], the [[philosophy of science]] including two books on physics coauthored with [[Peter E. Hodgson]], [[causality]], [[political philosophy]], ethics and [[business ethics]], and the [[philosophy of religion]].\n\nThe son of a [[Church of England]] clergyman, and an Anglican himself, Lucas describes himself as \"a dyed-in-the-wool traditional Englishman.\" He and Morar Portal have four children, among them [[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]], a former journalist at ''[[The Economist]]''.\n\nIn addition to his philosophical career, Lucas has a practical interest in [[business ethics]]. He helped found the Oxford Consumers' Group,<ref>[http://www.communigate.co.uk/oxford/oxfordconsumergroup/index.phtml Oxford Consumers' Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030830110852/http://www.communigate.co.uk/oxford/oxfordconsumergroup/index.phtml |date=30 August 2003 }}</ref> and was its first chairman in 1961-3, serving again in 1965.\n\n==Philosophical contributions==\n\n===Free will===\n[[Minds, Machines and G\u00f6del|Lucas (1961)]] began a lengthy and heated [[Mechanism (philosophy)#G\u00f6delian arguments|debate]] over the implications of [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]] for the [[Mechanism (philosophy)#Anthropic mechanism|anthropic mechanism thesis]], by arguing that:<ref>[http://www.leaderu.com/truth/2truth08.html J.R. Lucas, \"The G\u00f6delian Argument\"]</ref>\n# [[Determinism]] \u2194 For any human ''h'' there exists at least one (deterministic) [[logical system]] ''L''(''h'') which reliably predicts ''h'''s actions in all circumstances.\n# For any logical system ''L'' a sufficiently skilled [[mathematical logic]]ian (equipped with a sufficiently powerful computer if necessary) can construct some statements ''T''(''L'') which are true but unprovable in ''L''. (This follows from G\u00f6del's first theorem.) \n# If a human ''m'' is a sufficiently skillful mathematical logician (equipped with a sufficiently powerful computer if necessary) then if ''m'' is given ''L''(''m''), he or she can construct ''T''(''L''(''m'')) and determine that they are true\u2014which ''L''(''m'') cannot do.\n# Hence ''L''(''m'') does not reliably predict ''m'''s actions in all circumstances.\n# Hence ''m'' has [[free will]].\n# It is implausible that the qualitative difference between mathematical logicians and the rest of the population is such that the former have free will and the latter do not.\n\nHis argument was strengthened by the discovery by [[Hava Siegelmann]] in the 1990s that sufficiently complex analogue recurrent neural networks are equivalent to [[Turing Machine]]s.<ref>H.T. Siegelmann, \"Computation Beyond the Turing Limit,\" ''Science'', '''238'''(28), April 1995: 632\u2013637</ref>\n\n===Space, time and causality===\nLucas wrote several books on the philosophy of science and space-time (see below).

It fails to account for the passage of time, the pre-eminence of the present, the directedness of time and the difference between the future and the past\"<ref>''The Future'' (1989), p. 8.</ref> and in favour of a tree structure in which there is only one past or present (at any given point in spacetime) but a large number of possible futures. \"We are by our own decisions in the face of other men's actions and chance circumstances weaving the web of history on the loom of natural necessity\"<ref>''The Future'' (1989), p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n*1942-7.

The series is executive produced by Lauren LeFranc, [[Doug Liman]], [[David Bartis]], and Gene Klein. LeFranc also acts as showrunner for the series. In July 2018, the series was renewed for a second season consisting of ten episodes, which premiered on October 16, 2019. ''Impulse'' was canceled in March 2020.\n\n==Premise==\n''Impulse'' follows 16-year-old Henrietta \"Henry\" Coles who discovers she has the ability to [[Teleportation in fiction|teleport]] but has no control over her destination. The first time she realizes this, she is in a truck with her high school's basketball captain and star, Clay Boone, who tries to rape her. She has a seizure and teleports, in the course of which she inadvertently crushes much of his truck when her ability to teleport first manifests, leaving him a paraplegic. The show goes on to explore Henry's need to reconcile what her assailant tried to do with the consequence, and her feelings about discovering she can teleport and [[Psionics|psionically]] move objects from a distance, which are triggered by her feelings of fear regarding the assault.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Maddie Hasson]] as Henrietta \"Henry\" Coles, a teenage girl who possesses the ability to teleport, though has no control over her destination. She first realizes she has this capability while in the middle of being sexually assaulted. Her powers activate through emotional distress. She eventually is taught to control her powers. \n**Carina Battrick portrays a younger Henry Coles in a supporting role.\n*[[Sarah Desjardins]] as Jenna Faith Hope, Henry's soon-to-be stepsister and confidante. Initially cold and distant towards Henry, she becomes closer to her upon discovering that she was sexually assaulted. She soon begins questioning her sexuality.\n* [[Enuka Okuma]] as Anna Hulce, a deputy sheriff in Reston, investigating the incident which left Clay Boone physically disabled for life via his legs. She eventually witnesses a man teleporting away right before her eyes and confronts Henry about it.\n* Craig Arnold as Lucas Boone, a local mechanic, drug trafficker, and the eldest son of car and drug dealer Bill Boone. After spending time with the Millers and learning their religious ways, he returns to Reston and declares his unwavering devotion and allegiance to Henry as penance for what his father and brother put her through. \n* Tanner Stine as Clay Boone, a star of the local basketball team and Bill Boone's youngest son. A classmate of Henry's, Clay develops an interest in her when she begins attending school. While making out in his truck, he attempts to rape her. The assault causes her latent ability to teleport to activate, resulting in her having a seizure and teleporting away out of self-preservation. The resulting spatial distortion of Henry's escape crushes much of Clay's truck and leaves him without the use of his legs.

She gets a classmate, Clay, to retrieve her car for her, as it's in his family's lot. Later, they go to his car where he sexually assaults her. Panicking, she has another seizure and ends up in her room with part of Clay's car. She tells Jenna and they find Clay, call 911 and return home. Clay survives, but will be permanently paralyzed as a result. Later, Thomas finds part of Clay's car in Henry's room, but lies to Deputy Anne Hulce when she inquires about Henry's 911 call, stating she'd been home all night.

The first time she realizes this, she is in a truck with her high school's basketball captain and star, Clay Boone, who tries to rape her. She has a seizure and teleports, in the course of which she inadvertently crushes much of his truck when her ability to teleport first manifests, leaving him a paraplegic. The show goes on to explore Henry's need to reconcile what her assailant tried to do with the consequence, and her feelings about discovering she can teleport and [[Psionics|psionically]] move objects from a distance, which are triggered by her feelings of fear regarding the assault.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Maddie Hasson]] as Henrietta \"Henry\" Coles, a teenage girl who possesses the ability to teleport, though has no control over her destination.

It is suggested that it acts as an adaptor protein in events related to immune response and cholesterol regulation, for example. As a protein of the SNXs family, the SNX8 is formed of 465 aminoacids and presents a BAR-domain and a PX-domain which are very relevant in relation to its functions. Furthermore, SNX8 study is motivated by its medical significance in relation to diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease, cancer, neurodevelopmental malformations and to its role in fighting against viral infections.\n\n==Structure==\n===Sorting nexins (SNXs)===\n{{Main|Sorting nexin}}\nSNX8 belongs to the [[sorting nexin]] family of proteins, which mainly contain two functional membrane-binding that allow SNXs to have different roles in endosomal sorting and protein trafficking thanks to its membrane curvature ability.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9Y5X2|title=SNX8 - Sorting nexin-8 - Homo sapiens (Human) - SNX8 gene & protein|website=www.uniprot.org|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref> To begin with, [[PX domain|SNX-PX]] is a distinct [[Phosphatidylinositol|phosphoinositide]] (PI)-binding domain. The preferential interaction of this domain with membrane [[lipid]]s makes the main function of [[PX domain|SNX-PX]] the targeting of proteins to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) to [[endosome]]s. On the other hand, the [[Bar domain|BAR]] (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain is a key regulator of phosphoinositide-mediated, tubular-based endosomal sorting. Accordingly, this domain also [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimerizes]] to sense, stabilize and induce membrane curvature. The SNX-BAR proteins that contain both domains are a part of phosphoinositide-enriched, high-curvature tubular micro-domains of the endo-lysosomal network.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |last1=Muirhead |first1=Gillian |last2=Dev |first2=Kumlesh K. |title=The Expression of Neuronal Sorting Nexin 8 (SNX8) Exacerbates Abnormal Cholesterol Levels |journal=Journal of Molecular Neuroscience |date=2014 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=125\u2013134 |doi=10.1007/s12031-013-0209-z |pmid=24362679 }}</ref>\n\nThe&nbsp;[[mammal]]ian genome contains 12 genes coding for SNX-BAR proteins ([[SNX1]], [[SNX2]], [[SNX4]],[[SNX9]], [[SNX18]], SNX32 and SNX33). Other domains, such as [[PDZ domain|PDZ]] (postsynaptic density protein-95, discs-large, zona occludens-1), [[SH3 domain|SH3]] (Src homology 3) and RA (Ras-associated), are involved in protein-protein interactions.\n\n=== SNX8 ===\n[[File:SNX8 primary structure with highlighted relevant aminoacids and domains.png|thumb|367x367px|SNX8 primary structure highlighting relevant domains and amino acids.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/29886|title=SNX8 sorting nexin 8 [Homo sapiens (human)] - Gene - NCBI|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref><ref name=\":6\" />]]\nThe SNX8 protein, even though is very similar to the other sorting nexins, presents a domain structure which resembles the most to [[SNX1]]\u2019s and [[SNX9]]'s; for this reason, although its [[Protein tertiary structure|terciary structure]] remains unknown, it theoretically resembles that of [[SNX9]] shown in the model above. Overall, the SNX8 protein is integred by one unique peptide chain that has 465 [[amino acid]]s with a [[molecular mass]] of 52.569 Da.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==== PX Domain-containing N-terminus ====\n{{Main|PX domain}}\nSNX8 contains a PX domain in its N-terminus, which is located between amino acids 71 and 181. An homology domain with yeast's PX domain is localized between amino acids 75 and 178 within this same domain. As it is a [[Phosphatidylinositol|phosphoinositide]]-binding domain, it is important to highlight amino acids 109, 135 and 148 as residues directly related to [[phosphatidylinositol]] 3-phosphate since being specific binding sites, constituting a phosphoinositid binding site with a span of  40 amino acids.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> Furthermore, it includes a pair of [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylable]] [[tyrosine]]s in positions 95 and 126 that are key in its function in the IFN\u03b3-triggered IKK\u03b2-mediated noncanonical signaling pathway.<ref name=\":6\" /> Overall, the PX domain main function is to target SNX8 mainly to [[Endosome|early endosomes]] and other membranes rich in [[phosphatidylinositol]] 3-phosphate phospholipids.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== BAR Domain-containing C-terminus ====\n{{Main|BAR domain}}\nSNX contains a BAR domain in its C-terminus, which is located between amino acids 256 and 440. Its ability to form coatings in membranes in order to induce their curvature is key in SNX8 participation in tubular structures formation. Furthermore, SNX8 C-terminus contains a [[threonine]] in position 452 and a [[serine]] in position 456 which can go through post-traductional changes that induces its [[Protein phosphorylation|phosphorylation]], resulting in a phosphothreonine and a phosphoserine. Therefore, there are classified as phosphorylation sites.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== MVP1 ortholog ====\nSNX8 has a [[yeast]] [[Sequence homology|ortholog]] protein, the MVP1 encoded by the also homolog gene Mvp1p, which also plays a role by mediating transport of cargo to the [[Vacuole|vacuolar]] and [[Lysosome|lysosomal]] compartments. For this reason, its investigation can lead to a better understanding of SNX8 functions in human cells.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n==Biological functions and its molecular mechanisms==\nSNX8 is thought to be an [[adaptor]] protein involved in the '''endosome-to-Golgi transport pathway''', participating in [[endocytosis]] and '''endosomal sorting and signaling'''. It downregulates [[retrograde transport]] of intracellular proteins from the [[Endosome Types|early endosome compartment]] to the [[trans-Golgi network]] in a retromer-mediated manner. SNX8 is therefore localized in early endosomes, as its colocalization with components of the retromer such as [[SNX1]], [[SNX2]], [[VPS26A|Vps26]] and [[VPS35|Vps35]] has been demonstrated by some studies (and also with [[EEA1]]).<ref name=\":11\">{{cite journal |last1=Dyve |first1=Anne Berit |last2=Bergan |first2=Jonas |last3=Utskarpen |first3=Audrun |last4=Sandvig |first4=Kirsten |title=Sorting nexin 8 regulates endosome-to-Golgi transport |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |date=December 2009 |volume=390 |issue=1 |pages=109\u2013114 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.09.076 |pmid=19782049 }}</ref> Furthermore, the dynamics of endosomal structures with SNX8-enriched membrane domains are regulated by the opposite [[motor protein]]s [[Dynein|dynein-1]] containing LIC1 and [[Kinesin|kinesin-1]], both of which allow SNX8-mediated cargo movement through the [[cytosol]] by exerting forces on these structures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hunt |first1=Sylvie D. |last2=Townley |first2=Anna K. |last3=Danson |first3=Chris M. |last4=Cullen |first4=Peter J. |last5=Stephens |first5=David J. |title=Microtubule motors mediate endosomal sorting by maintaining functional domain organization |journal=Journal of Cell Science |date=1 June 2013 |volume=126 |issue=11 |pages=2493\u20132501 |doi=10.1242/jcs.122317 |pmid=23549789 |pmc=3679488 }}</ref> The biological functions of SNX8 that have been studied, all of which involve its role in intracellular endosomal transport, are explained in more detail in the following sections.\n\n=== Innate immune response ===\n==== Cytosolic RNA virus-triggered response ====\nSNX8 is a key component in the induction of [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|downstream]] [[Effector (biology)|effector]] antiviral gene [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] in response to [[RNA virus]]es, as it is necessari for [[RIG-I-like receptor|RLR]]-mediated activation of the IFN\u03b2 promoter that leads to host defense in a dose-dependent manner. It positively regulates the [[Particle aggregation|aggregation]] and activation of [[Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein|VISA]], a key [[Signal transducing adaptor protein|adaptor protein]] involved in the innate immune response against this type of infections; this process is critical in the recruitment of other [[Cell signaling|signaling]] components. Although SNX8's standard localization includes the [[cytoplasm]] and other compartments such as the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|ER]], the [[Vesicular-tubular cluster|ER-Golgi intermediate compartment]], the [[Golgi apparatus]] or [[endosome]]s, it is partially localized at [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. Furthermore, RNA viral infections cause the translocation of SNX8 from the [[cytosol]] to the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. During the early stage of the infection, SNX8 association with [[Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein|VISA]] increases above constitutive levels (degradation of [[Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein|VISA]] in later stages results in a reduction of this phenomenon).

The reception of [[Interferon gamma|IFN\u03b3]] activates [[Janus kinase 1]], resulting in the stimulation of its association with Sxn8 above standard constitutive levels. The link between these two protein within the [[Janus kinase 1|JAK1]]-SNX8 complex allows [[Janus kinase 1|JAK1]] to catalyse SNX8's [[tyrosines]] [[phosphorylation]] in positions 95 and 126. This [[Protein phosphorylation|phosphorylation]] activates the [[Janus kinase 1|JAK1]]-SNX, and the SNX8 acts as an [[Signal transducing adaptor protein|adaptor or scaffolding protein]] by permitting the recruitment of the [[IKK2|inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa-B kinase subunit beta]] (IKK\u03b2) to [[Janus kinase 1|JAK1]] in the [[Janus kinase 1|JAK1]]-SNX8-[[IKK2|IKK\u03b2]] complex.

For example, it is unclear if SNX8 has a direct participation in the transport of [[Sterol regulatory element-binding protein|SREBP]] pathway components or if it regulates [[Endosome|endosomal]] and [[Lysosome|lysosomal]] compartimentalisation through the production of cholesterol cargoes.

The amyloidogenic pathway leads to [[Amyloid precursor protein|APP]] processement by [[Gamma secretase|\u03b3-secretases]] and [[Beta-secretase|\u03b2-secretases]] such as [[Beta-secretase 1|BACE1]], resulting in production of the neurotoxic [[amyloid beta]] (A\u03b2) peptide that accumulates in extracellular locations forming [[senile plaques]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nSNX8 promotes non-amyloidogenic transport from the [[Golgi apparatus]] to other cellular locations, leading to an increase of [[Amyloid precursor protein|APP]] levels, a stimulated distribution throughout the outer face of [[cell membrane]], an enhanced sAPP\u03b1 secretion and a reduced [[Amyloid beta|A\u03b2]] production (specifically, production of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242) . In addition, SNX8 improves [[Amyloid precursor protein|APP]] stability, which is responsible for a longer lifespan, without having any effect in its [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]]. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that SNX8 mainly colocalizes with [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab5]] at [[Endosome#Types|early endosomes]] and partially with [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab4]] at [[Endosomes#Types|recycling endosomes]], with [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab7]] at [[Endosome#Types|late endosomes]] and with [[Giantin]] at [[Golgi apparatus]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n===Construction of tubular profiles===\nAlthough the [[Endosome|endosomal compartment]] is composed of [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicular]] and tubular structures, it has been demonstrated that sorting involving recycling pathways is mainly tubule-mediated. Therefore, tubular structures building is essential for the activity of [[Sorting nexin|SNXs]] containing [[BAR domain]]s (such as [[SNX1]], [[SNX4]] or SNX8) as [[Phosphatidylinositol|phosphoinositide]]-mediated endosomal sorting proteins. This [[BAR domain]] allows them to assembly in a dose-dependent manner an helical coat with the capacity to detect, promote and stabilize the curvature of endosomal vesicular membranes into tubular profiles during the so-called incidence detection process, specially in [[Phosphatidylinositol|phosphoinosited]]-enriched regions where they are localized thanks to the affinity of the [[PX domain]] for these [[Phospholipid|membrane phospholipids]]. In particular, SNX8 colocalizes with [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab5]] at [[Endosome#Types|early endosomes]] membranes and at the [[Endosome#Types|tubular endosomal network]] (TEN) around the endosomal vacuole, which is an important compartment for successful sorting of cargoes.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal |last1=van Weering |first1=Jan R.T. |last2=Verkade |first2=Paul |last3=Cullen |first3=Peter J. |title=SNX-BAR-Mediated Endosome Tubulation is Co-ordinated with Endosome Maturation |journal=Traffic |date=January 2012 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=94\u2013107 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01297.x |pmid=21973056 }}</ref>\n\nIt is also worth mentioning the existing coupling of tubular structures formation and the [[Endosome#Types|maduration processes from early endosomes to late endosomes]], which is mainly characterized by a retrograde movement from the cell periphery to a juxtanuclear position, an acidification of [[Endosome#Types|early endosomes]] lumen and a switch from [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab5 GTPase]] to [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab7 GTPase]]. The construction of these tubules, which is important for SNX-mediated endosomal sorting, experiments an important acceleration during this transition process; therefore, it is suggested that SNX8 may be involved in the transport of endogenous acid environment-requiring cargo. In addition, as SNX8 interacts with elements of the [[retromer]], it is important to highlight the role of both [[Retromer|subcomplexes of the retromer]] in the coordinated relationship between [[Endosome#Types|endosomal maturation]] and the generation of tubular profiles from vesicular structures.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Medical and clinical significance==\n=== Alzheimer's disease ===\nInsoluble accumulations of [[Amyloid beta|\u03b2-amyloid]] peptide in [[brain]] regions related to memory and cognition are a defining characteristic of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's Disease (AD)]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Glenner|first=George G.|last2=Wong|first2=Caine W.|date=May 1984|title=Alzheimer's disease: Initial report of the purification and characterization of a novel cerebrovascular amyloid protein|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|volume=120|issue=3|pages=885\u2013890|doi=10.1016/S0006-291X(84)80190-4|pmid=6375662}}</ref> SNX8 has a [[Neuroprotection|neuroprotective]] role related to [[Alzheimer's disease|AD]]: it enhances the non-amyloidogenic [[Amyloid precursor protein|APP]] pathway and, hence, reduces the [[Senile plaques|A\u03b2 plaques and deposit accumulations]] and suppresses cognitive impairment caused by [[Alzheimer's disease|AD]].

During the early stage of the infection, SNX8 association with [[Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein|VISA]] increases above constitutive levels (degradation of [[Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein|VISA]] in later stages results in a reduction of this phenomenon). Structurally, the [[C-terminus]] [[transmembrane domain]] of [[Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein|VISA]] and both [[N-terminus]] [[PX domain]] and [[C-terminus]] of SNX8 are necessary for this linkage.

This [[BAR domain]] allows them to assembly in a dose-dependent manner an helical coat with the capacity to detect, promote and stabilize the curvature of endosomal vesicular membranes into tubular profiles during the so-called incidence detection process, specially in [[Phosphatidylinositol|phosphoinosited]]-enriched regions where they are localized thanks to the affinity of the [[PX domain]] for these [[Phospholipid|membrane phospholipids]]. In particular, SNX8 colocalizes with [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab5]] at [[Endosome#Types|early endosomes]] membranes and at the [[Endosome#Types|tubular endosomal network]] (TEN) around the endosomal vacuole, which is an important compartment for successful sorting of cargoes.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal |last1=van Weering |first1=Jan R.T. |last2=Verkade |first2=Paul |last3=Cullen |first3=Peter J. |title=SNX-BAR-Mediated Endosome Tubulation is Co-ordinated with Endosome Maturation |journal=Traffic |date=January 2012 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=94\u2013107 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01297.x |pmid=21973056 }}</ref>\n\nIt is also worth mentioning the existing coupling of tubular structures formation and the [[Endosome#Types|maduration processes from early endosomes to late endosomes]], which is mainly characterized by a retrograde movement from the cell periphery to a juxtanuclear position, an acidification of [[Endosome#Types|early endosomes]] lumen and a switch from [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab5 GTPase]] to [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab7 GTPase]]. The construction of these tubules, which is important for SNX-mediated endosomal sorting, experiments an important acceleration during this transition process; therefore, it is suggested that SNX8 may be involved in the transport of endogenous acid environment-requiring cargo. In addition, as SNX8 interacts with elements of the [[retromer]], it is important to highlight the role of both [[Retromer|subcomplexes of the retromer]] in the coordinated relationship between [[Endosome#Types|endosomal maturation]] and the generation of tubular profiles from vesicular structures.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Medical and clinical significance==\n=== Alzheimer's disease ===\nInsoluble accumulations of [[Amyloid beta|\u03b2-amyloid]] peptide in [[brain]] regions related to memory and cognition are a defining characteristic of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's Disease (AD)]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Glenner|first=George G.|last2=Wong|first2=Caine W.|date=May 1984|title=Alzheimer's disease: Initial report of the purification and characterization of a novel cerebrovascular amyloid protein|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|volume=120|issue=3|pages=885\u2013890|doi=10.1016/S0006-291X(84)80190-4|pmid=6375662}}</ref> SNX8 has a [[Neuroprotection|neuroprotective]] role related to [[Alzheimer's disease|AD]]: it enhances the non-amyloidogenic [[Amyloid precursor protein|APP]] pathway and, hence, reduces the [[Senile plaques|A\u03b2 plaques and deposit accumulations]] and suppresses cognitive impairment caused by [[Alzheimer's disease|AD]].
