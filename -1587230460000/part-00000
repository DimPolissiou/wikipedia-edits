{"title_page": "Purchasing power parity", "text_new": "{{short description|Economic theory that states that the exchange rate between two countries is equal to the ratio of the currencies' respective purchasing power}}\n'''Purchasing power parity''' ('''PPP''')<ref name=\"Krugman2\" /> is a measurement of prices in different areas using specific goods, to contrast the absolute purchasing power between currencies. In many cases, PPP produces an inflation rate that is equal to the price of the basket of goods at one location divided by the price of the basket of goods at a different location. The PPP inflation and exchange rate may differ from the[[Exchange rate| market exchange rate]] because of poverty, tariffs and other [[Transaction cost|frictions]]. PPP exchange baud modem fortress worm rates are widely used when comparing the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|GDP of different countries]].<ref name=Burgernomics>{{cite web |last1=Pakko |first1=Michael |title=Burgernomics |url=https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/03/11/pakko.pdf |website=St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank |accessdate=24 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Concept==\n\nPurchasing power parity is an [[Economics|economic]] term for measuring prices at different locations.  It is based on the [[law of one price]], which says that, if there are no [[transaction cost]]s nor [[trade barrier]]s for a particular good, then the price for that good should be the same at every location.<ref name=\"Krugman2\">{{cite book|last=Krugman and Obstfeld|title=International Economics|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.}}</ref> So, in the ideal, a computer in New York and in Hong Kong should have the same price.  If its price is 500 US Dollars in New York and the same computer costs 2000 HK Dollars in Hong Kong, PPP theory says the exchange rate should be 4 HK Dollars for every 1 US Dollar.\n\nPoverty, tariffs, and other frictions prevent trading and purchasing of various goods, so measuring a single good can cause a large error. PPP term accounts for this by using a [[Market_basket|basket of goods]], that is, many goods with different quantities. PPP then computes an inflation and exchange rate as the ratio of the price of the basket in one location to the price of the basket in the other location. For example, if a basket consisting of 1 computer, 1 ton of rice, and 1 ton of steel was 1800 US Dollars in New York and the same goods cost 10800 HK Dollars in Hong Kong, the PPP exchange rate would be 6 HK Dollars for every 1 US Dollar.  \n\nThe name ''purchasing power parity'' comes from the idea that, with the right exchange rate, consumers in every location will have the same [[purchasing power]].\n\nThe value of the PPP exchange rate is very dependent on the basket of goods chosen. In general, goods are chosen that might closely obey the Law of One Price. So, ones traded easily and are commonly available in both locations. Organizations that compute PPP exchange rates use different baskets of goods and can come up with different values.  \n\nThe PPP exchange rate may not match the market exchange rate. The market rate is more [[Volatility (finance)|volatile]] because it reacts to changes in demand at each location. Also, tariffs and difference in the price of labor (see [[Balassa\u2013Samuelson theorem]]) can contribute to longer term differences between the two rates. One use of PPP is to predict longer term exchange rates.\n\nBecause PPP exchange rates are more stable and are less affected by tariffs, they are used for many international comparisons, such as comparing countries' GDPs or other national income statistics. These numbers often come with the label ''PPP-adjusted''. \n\nThere can be marked differences between purchasing power adjusted incomes and those converted via market exchange rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/36a2d566-ad82-11dc-9386-0000779fd2ac.html|title=China, India economies '40% smaller'|first=Scheherazade|last= Daneshkhu|date=18 December 2007|work=Financial Times}}</ref> A well-known purchasing power adjustment is the [[Geary\u2013Khamis dollar]] (the ''international dollar''). The [[World Bank|World Bank's]] ''World Development Indicators 2005'' estimated that in 2003, one Geary\u2013Khamis dollar was equivalent to about 1.8 [[Renminbi|Chinese yuan]] by purchasing power parity<ref>[http://devdata.worldbank.org/wdi2005/Table5_7.htm 2005 World Development Indicators: Table 5.7 | Relative prices and exchange rates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223140429/http://devdata.worldbank.org/wdi2005/Table5_7.htm |date=2007-02-23 }}</ref>\u2014considerably different from the nominal exchange rate. This discrepancy has large implications; for instance, when converted via the nominal exchange rates [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita]] in [[India]] is about [[United States dollar|US$]]1,965<ref>[[List of countries by past and future GDP (nominal)]]</ref> while on a PPP basis it is about US$7,197.<ref>[[List of countries by future GDP (PPP) per capita estimates]]</ref> At the other extreme, for instance [[Denmark|Denmark's]] nominal GDP per capita is around US$53,242, but its PPP figure is US$46,602, in line with other [[developed nations]].\n\n===Variations===\n\nThere are variations to calculating PPP. The EKS method (developed by \u00d6. \u00c9ltet\u0151, P. K\u00f6ves and B. Szulc) uses the [[geometric mean]] of the exchange rates computed for individual goods.<ref>{{cite web |title=EKS Method |url=https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=5525 |publisher=OECD}}</ref> The EKS-S method (by \u00c9ltet\u0151, K\u00f6ves, Szulc, and Sergeev) uses two different baskets, one for each country, and then averages the result.  While these methods work for 2 countries, the exchange rates may be inconsistent if applied to 3 countries, so further adjustment may be necessary so that the rate from currency A to B times the rate from B to C equals the rate from A to C.\n\n===Relative PPP===\n\n{{Main|Relative purchasing power parity}}\n\nRelative PPP is a weaker statement based on the law of one price, covering changes in the exchange rate and inflation rates. It seems to mirror the exchange rate closer than PPP does.<ref name=Burgernomics />\n\n==Usage==\n===Conversion===\n\nPurchasing power parity exchange rate is used when comparing [[Gross domestic product|national production]] and consumption and other places where the prices of non-traded goods are considered important.  (Market exchange rates are used for individual goods that are traded). PPP rates are more stable over time and can be used when that attribute is important.\n\nPPP exchange rates help [[costing]] but exclude profits and above all do not consider the different [[Quality (business)|quality of goods]] among countries. The same product, for instance, can have a different level of quality and even safety in different countries, and may be subject to different taxes and transport costs. Since market exchange rates fluctuate substantially, when the GDP of one country measured in its own currency is converted to the other country's currency using market exchange rates, one country might be inferred to have higher [[real GDP]] than the other country in one year but lower in the other; both of these inferences would fail to reflect the reality of their ''relative levels of production''. But if one country's GDP is converted into the other country's currency using PPP exchange rates instead of observed market exchange rates, the false inference will not occur. Essentially GDP measured at PPP controls for the different costs of living and price levels, usually relative to the United States dollar, enabling a more accurate estimate of a nation's level of production.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| width = 400\n| direction = vertical\n}}\n\nThe exchange rate reflects transaction values for [[tradable goods|traded goods]] ''between'' countries in contrast to non-traded goods, that is, goods produced for home-country use. Also, currencies are traded for purposes other than trade in goods and services, ''e.g.'', to buy [[capital asset]]s whose prices vary more than those of physical goods. Also, different [[interest rate]]s, [[speculation]], [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] or interventions by [[central bank]]s can influence the [[foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange market]].\n\nThe PPP method is used as an alternative to correct for possible statistical bias. The [[Penn World Table]] is a widely cited source of PPP adjustments, and the associated [[Penn effect]] reflects such a [[systematic bias]] in using exchange rates to outputs among countries.\n\nFor example, if the value of the [[Mexican peso]] falls by half compared to the [[US dollar]], the Mexican [[gross domestic product]] measured in dollars will also halve. However, this exchange rate results from international trade and financial markets. It does not necessarily mean that Mexicans are poorer by a half; if incomes and prices measured in pesos stay the same, they will be no worse off assuming that imported goods are not essential to the quality of life of individuals. Measuring income in different countries using PPP exchange rates helps to avoid this problem.\n\n===Exchange rate prediction===\n\nPPP exchange rates are also valued because market exchange rates tend to move in their general direction, over a period of years.  There is some value to knowing in which direction the exchange rate is more likely to shift over the long run.\n\nIn [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] [[economic theory]], the ''purchasing power parity theory'' assumes that the exchange rate between two currencies actually observed in the [[foreign exchange market]] is the one that is used in the purchasing power parity comparisons, so that the same amount of goods could actually be purchased in either currency with the same beginning amount of funds. Depending on the particular theory, purchasing power parity is assumed to hold either in the [[long run]] or, more strongly, in the [[short run]]. Theories that invoke purchasing power parity assume that in some circumstances a fall in either currency's purchasing power(a rise in its price level) would lead to a proportional decrease in that currency's valuation on the foreign exchange market.\n\n===Identifying manipulation===\n\nPPP exchange rates are especially useful when official exchange rates are artificially manipulated by governments. Countries with strong government control of the economy sometimes enforce official exchange rates that make their own currency artificially strong. By contrast, the currency's black market exchange rate is artificially weak. In such cases, a PPP exchange rate is likely the most realistic basis for economic comparison. Similarly, when exchange rates deviate significantly from their long term equilibrium due to speculative attacks or carry trade, a PPP exchange rate offers a better alternative for comparison.\n\nIn 2011, the [[Big Mac Index]] was used to [[Big Mac Index#Manipulation|identify manipulation of inflation numbers by Argentina]].  Argentina responded by manipulating the Big Mac Index.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/24/argentinas-big-mac-attack/|title=Argentina's Big Mac Attack|last=Politi|first=Daniel|date=2011-11-24|website=Latitude|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023175605/https://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/24/argentinas-big-mac-attack/|archive-date=2019-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Issues==\n\nThe PPP exchange-rate calculation is controversial because of the difficulties of finding comparable [[Market basket|baskets of goods]] to compare purchasing power across countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taylor and Taylor|first=Alan and Mark|date=Fall 2004|title=The Purchasing Power Parity Debate|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~mchinn/taylor&taylor_PPP_JEP.pdf|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=18| issue = 4|pages=135\u2013158|via=|doi=10.1257/0895330042632744}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nEstimation of purchasing power parity is complicated by the fact that countries do not simply differ in a uniform [[price level]]; rather, the difference in food prices may be greater than the difference in housing prices, while also less than the difference in entertainment prices. People in different countries typically consume different baskets of goods. It is necessary to compare the cost of baskets of goods and services using a [[price index]]. This is a difficult task because purchasing patterns and even the goods available to purchase differ across countries.\n\nThus, it is necessary to make adjustments for differences in the quality of goods and services. Furthermore, the basket of goods representative of one economy will vary from that of another: Americans eat more bread; Chinese more rice. Hence a PPP calculated using the US consumption as a base will differ from that calculated using China as a base. Additional statistical difficulties arise with multilateral comparisons when(as is usually the case) more than two countries are to be compared.\n\nVarious ways of averaging bilateral PPPs can provide a more stable multilateral comparison, but at the cost of distorting bilateral ones. These are all general issues of indexing; as with other [[price index|price indices]] there is no way to reduce complexity to a single number that is equally satisfying for all purposes. Nevertheless, PPPs are typically robust in the face of the many problems that arise in using market exchange rates to make comparisons.\n\nFor example, in 2005 the price of a gallon of gasoline in Saudi Arabia was US$0.91, and in Norway the price was US$6.27.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/global_gasprices/|work=CNN/Money|title=Global gas prices|date=23 March 2005}}</ref> The significant differences in price would not contribute to accuracy in a PPP analysis, despite all of the variables that contribute to the significant differences in price. More comparisons have to be made and used as variables in the overall formulation of the PPP.\n\nWhen PPP comparisons are to be made over some interval of time, proper account needs to be made of [[inflation]]ary effects.\n\nIn addition to methodological issues presented by the selection of a basket of goods, PPP estimates can also vary based on the statistical capacity of participating countries. The [[International Comparison Program]], which PPP estimates are based on, require the disaggregation of national accounts into production, expenditure or (in some cases) income, and not all participating countries routinely disaggregate their data into such categories.\n\nSome aspects of PPP comparison are theoretically impossible or unclear. For example, there is no basis for comparison between the Ethiopian laborer who lives on teff with the Thai laborer who lives on rice, because teff is not commercially available in Thailand and rice is not in Ethiopia, so the price of rice in Ethiopia or teff in Thailand cannot be determined. As a general rule, the more similar the price structure between countries, the more valid the PPP comparison.\n\nPPP levels will also vary based on the formula used to calculate price matrices. Possible formulas include GEKS-Fisher, Geary-Khamis, IDB, and the superlative method. Each has advantages and disadvantages.\n\nLinking regions presents another methodological difficulty. In the 2005 ICP round, regions were compared by using a list of some 1,000 identical items for which a price could be found for 18 countries, selected so that at least two countries would be in each region. While this was superior to earlier \"bridging\" methods, which do not fully take into account differing quality between goods, it may serve to overstate the PPP basis of poorer countries, because the price indexing on which PPP is based will assign to poorer countries the greater weight of goods consumed in greater shares in richer countries.\n\nThere are a number of reasons that different measures do not perfectly reflect standards of living.\n\n===Range and quality of goods===\nThe goods that the currency has the \"power\" to purchase are a basket of goods of different types:\n# Local, non-tradable goods and services (like electric power) that are produced and sold domestically.\n# Tradable goods such as non-perishable [[Commodity|commodities]] that can be sold on the international market (like [[diamond]]s).\n\nThe more that a product falls into category 1, the further its price will be from the currency [[exchange rate]], moving towards the PPP exchange rate. Conversely, category 2 products tend to trade close to the currency exchange rate. (See also [[Penn effect]]).\n\nMore processed and expensive products are likely to be [[tradable]], falling into the second category, and drifting from the PPP exchange rate to the currency exchange rate. Even if the PPP \"value\" of the Ethiopian currency is three times stronger than the currency exchange rate, it won't buy three times as much of internationally traded goods like steel, cars and microchips, but non-traded goods like housing, services (\"haircuts\"), and domestically produced crops. The relative price differential between tradables and non-tradables from high-income to low-income countries is a consequence of the [[Balassa\u2013Samuelson effect]] and gives a big cost advantage to labour-intensive production of tradable goods in low income countries (like [[Ethiopia]]), as against high income countries (like [[Switzerland]]).\n\nThe corporate cost advantage is nothing more sophisticated than access to cheaper workers, but because the pay of those workers goes farther in low-income countries than high, the relative pay differentials (inter-country) can be sustained for longer than would be the case otherwise. (This is another way of saying that the wage rate is based on average local productivity and that this is below the per capita productivity that factories selling tradable goods to international markets can achieve.) An equivalent [[cost]] benefit comes from non-traded goods that can be sourced locally (nearer the PPP-exchange rate than the nominal exchange rate in which receipts are paid). These act as a cheaper [[factor of production]] than is available to factories in richer countries. It is difficult by GDP PPP to consider the different quality of goods among the countries.\n\nThe Bhagwati\u2013Kravis\u2013Lipsey view provides a somewhat different explanation from the Balassa\u2013Samuelson theory. This view states that price levels for nontradables are lower in poorer countries because of differences in endowment of labor and capital, not because of lower levels of productivity. Poor countries have more labor relative to capital, so marginal productivity of labor is greater in rich countries than in poor countries. Nontradables tend to be labor-intensive; therefore, because labor is less expensive in poor countries and is used mostly for nontradables, nontradables are cheaper in poor countries. Wages are high in rich countries, so nontradables are relatively more expensive.<ref name=\"Krugman\"/>\n\nPPP calculations tend to overemphasise the primary sectoral contribution, and underemphasise the industrial and service sectoral contributions to the economy of a nation.\n\n===Trade barriers and nontradables===\nThe law of one price, the underlying mechanism behind PPP, is weakened by transport costs and governmental trade restrictions, which make it expensive to move goods between markets located in different countries. Transport costs sever the link between exchange rates and the prices of goods implied by the law of one price. As transport costs increase, the larger the range of exchange rate fluctuations. The same is true for official trade restrictions because the customs fees affect importers' profits in the same way as shipping fees. According to Krugman and Obstfeld, \"Either type of trade impediment weakens the basis of PPP by allowing the purchasing power of a given currency to differ more widely from country to country.\"<ref name=Krugman>{{cite book|last=Krugman and Obstfeld|title=International Economics|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|pages=394\u2013395}}</ref>  They cite the example that a dollar in London should purchase the same goods as a dollar in Chicago, which is certainly not the case.\n\nNontradables are primarily services and the output of the construction industry. Nontradables also lead to deviations in PPP because the prices of nontradables are not linked internationally. The prices are determined by domestic supply and demand, and shifts in those curves lead to changes in the market basket of some goods relative to the foreign price of the same basket. If the prices of nontradables rise, the purchasing power of any given currency will fall in that country.<ref name=\"Krugman\"/>\n\n===Departures from free competition===\nLinkages between national price levels are also weakened when trade barriers and imperfectly competitive market structures occur together. Pricing to market occurs when a firm sells the same product for different prices in different markets. This is a reflection of inter-country differences in conditions on both the demand side (''e.g.'', virtually no demand for pork in Islamic states) and the supply side (''e.g.'', whether the existing market for a prospective entrant's product features few suppliers or instead is already near-saturated). According to Krugman and Obstfeld, this occurrence of product differentiation and segmented markets results in violations of the law of one price and absolute PPP. Over time, shifts in market structure and demand will occur, which may invalidate relative PPP.<ref name=\"Krugman\"/>\n\n===Differences in price level measurement===\nMeasurement of price levels differ from country to country. Inflation data from different countries are based on different commodity baskets; therefore, exchange rate changes do not offset official measures of inflation differences. Because it makes predictions about price changes rather than price levels, relative PPP is still a useful concept. However, change in the relative prices of basket components can cause relative PPP to fail tests that are based on official price indexes.<ref name=\"Krugman\"/>\n\n===Global poverty line===\nThe global poverty line is a worldwide count of people who live below an international [[poverty line]], referred to as the dollar-a-day line. This line represents an average of the national poverty lines of the [[least developed country|world's poorest countries]], expressed in international dollars.  These national poverty lines are converted to international currency and the global line is converted back to local currency using the PPP exchange rates from the ICP. PPP exchange rates include data from the sales of high end non-poverty related items which skews the value of food items and necessary goods which is 70 percent of poor peoples' consumption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/archive/policy_innovations/index|title=Policy Innovations Digital Magazine (2006-2016) {{!}} Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs|website=www.carnegiecouncil.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> Angus Deaton argues that PPP indices need to be reweighted for use in poverty measurement; they need to be redefined to reflect local poverty measures, not global measures, weighing local food items and excluding luxury items that are not prevalent or are not of equal value in all localities.<ref>[http://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/presidential%20address%2019january%202010%20all.pdf Price indexes, inequality, and the measurement of world poverty Angus Deaton, Princeton University]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe idea originated with the [[School of Salamanca]] in the 16th century, and was developed in its modern form by [[Gustav Cassel]] in 1916, in ''The Present Situation of the Foreign Trade''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cassel|first=Gustav|date=December 1918|title=Abnormal Deviations in International Exchanges|journal=The Economic Journal|volume= 28|issue=112|pages=413\u2013415|jstor=2223329|doi=10.2307/2223329|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1759129}}</ref><ref name=princetonenc>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Cheung |first=Yin-Wong|editor-last=Reinert|editor-first=Kenneth A.|editor2-last=Rajan |editor2-first=Ramkishen S.|editor3-last=Glass|editor3-first=Amy Jocelyn|editor4-first=Lewis S. |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Davis|title=purchasing power parity|encyclopedia=The Princeton Encyclopedia of the World Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnEDno1hTegC&pg=PA942|accessdate=2 October 2011|volume=I|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0-691-12812-2 |page=942}}</ref> While Gustav Cassel's use of PPP concept has been traditionally interpreted as his attempt to formulate a positive theory of exchange rate determination, the policy and theoretical context in which Cassel wrote about exchange rates suggests different interpretation.&nbsp; In the years immediately preceding the end of WWI and following it economists and politicians were involved in discussions on possible ways of restoring the [[gold standard]], which would automatically restore the system of [[Fixed exchange-rate system|fixed exchange rates]] among participating nations. &nbsp;The stability of exchange rates was widely believed to be crucial for restoring the international trade and for its further stable and balanced growth.&nbsp; Nobody then was mentally prepared for the idea that flexible exchange rates determined by market forces do not necessarily cause chaos and instability in the peaceful time(and that is what the abandoning of the gold standard during the war was blamed for). &nbsp;Gustav Cassel was among those who supported the idea of restoring the gold standard, although with some alterations.&nbsp; The question, which Gustav Cassel tried to answer in his works written during that period, was not how exchange rates are determined in the free market, but rather how to determine the appropriate level at which exchange rates were to be fixed during the restoration of the system of fixed exchange rates.&nbsp; His recommendation was to fix exchange rates at the level corresponding to the PPP, as he believed that this would prevent trade imbalances between trading nations.&nbsp; Thus, PPP doctrine proposed by Cassel was not really a positive theory of exchange rate determination (as Cassel was perfectly aware of numerous factors that prevent exchange rates from stabilizing at PPP level if allowed to float), but rather a normative policy advice, formulated in the context of discussions on returning to the gold standard.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kadochnikov|first=Denis|date=2013|title=Gustav Cassel's purchasing power parity doctrine in the context of his views on international economic policy coordination|journal=European Journal of the History of Economic Thought|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1101\u20131121|doi=10.1080/09672567.2013.824999}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n===Professional===\n====OECD comparative price levels====\nEach month, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) measures the differences in price levels between its member countries by calculating the ratios of PPPs for [[household final consumption expenditure|private final consumption expenditure]] to exchange rates.

The index was created and popularized by ''[[The Economist]]'' as a way to teach economics and to identify over- and under-valued currencies. \n\nThe Big Mac has the value of being a relatively standardized consumer product that includes input costs from a wide range of sectors in the local economy, such as agricultural commodities (beef, bread, lettuce, cheese), labor (blue and white collar), advertising, rent and real estate costs, transportation, etc.  \n\nThere are some problems with the Big Mac Index.  A Big Mac is perishable and not easily transported.  That means the [[Law of one price|Law of One Price]] is not likely to keep prices the same in different locations.  McDonald's restaurants are not present in every country, which limits the index's usage.  Moreover, Big Macs are not sold at every McDonald's ([[Cattle_slaughter_in_India|noticeably in India]]), which limits its usage further.\n\nIn the white paper, \"Burgernomics\", the authors computed a correlation of 0.73 between the Big Mac Index's prices and prices calculated using the Penn World Tables.  This single-good index captures most, but not all, of the effects captured by more professional (and more complex) PPP measurement.<ref name=Burgernomics />  \n\n''The Economist'' uses The Big Mac Index to identify overvalued and undervalued currencies.  That is, ones where the Big Mac is expense or cheap, when measured using current exchange rates.  The January 2019 article states that a Big Mac costs HK$20.00 in Hong Kong and US$5.58 in the United States.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/2019/01/10/the-big-mac-index|title=The Big Mac index|date=2019-01-10|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-07-02|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>  The implied PPP exchange rate is 3.58 HK$ per US$. The difference between this and the actual exchange rate of 7.83 suggests that the Hong Kong dollar is 54.2% undervalued.  That is, it is cheaper to convert US Dollars into HK$ and buy a Big Mac in Hong Kong than it is to buy a Big Mac directly in US Dollars.\n\n====KFC Index====\n{{Main|KFC Index}}\n\nSimilar to the [[Big Mac Index]], the [[KFC Index]] measures PPP with a basket that contains a single item:  a [[KFC]] Original 12/15 pc. bucket.   The Big Mac Index cannot be used for most countries in Africa because most do not have a McDonald's restaurant.  Thus, the KFC Index was created by Sagaci Research (a [[market research]] firm focusing solely on Africa) to identify over- and under-valued currencies in Africa.  \n\nFor example, the average price of KFC's Original 12 pc. Bucket in the United States in January 2016 was $20.50; while in Namibia it was only $13.40 at market exchange rates. Therefore, the index states the Namibian dollar was undervalued by 33% at that time.\n====iPad Index====\nLike the [[Big Mac Index]], the iPad index (elaborated by [[Commonwealth Securities|CommSec]]) compares an item's price in various locations.  Unlike the Big Mac, however, each iPad is produced in the same place (except for the model sold in Brazil) and all iPads (within the same model) have identical performance characteristics.

In many cases, PPP produces an inflation rate that is equal to the price of the basket of goods at one location divided by the price of the basket of goods at a different location. The PPP inflation and exchange rate may differ from the[[Exchange rate| market exchange rate]] because of poverty, tariffs and other [[Transaction cost|frictions]]. PPP exchange rates are widely used when comparing the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|GDP of different countries]].<ref name=Burgernomics>{{cite web |last1=Pakko |first1=Michael |title=Burgernomics |url=https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/03/11/pakko.pdf |website=St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank |accessdate=24 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Concept==\n\nPurchasing power parity is an [[Economics|economic]] term for measuring prices at different locations.  It is based on the [[law of one price]], which says that, if there are no [[transaction cost]]s nor [[trade barrier]]s for a particular good, then the price for that good should be the same at every location.<ref name=\"Krugman2\">{{cite book|last=Krugman and Obstfeld|title=International Economics|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.}}</ref> So, in the ideal, a computer in New York and in Hong Kong should have the same price.  If its price is 500 US Dollars in New York and the same computer costs 2000 HK Dollars in Hong Kong, PPP theory says the exchange rate should be 4 HK Dollars for every 1 US Dollar.\n\nPoverty, tariffs, and other frictions prevent trading and purchasing of various goods, so measuring a single good can cause a large error. PPP term accounts for this by using a [[Market_basket|basket of goods]], that is, many goods with different quantities. PPP then computes an inflation and exchange rate as the ratio of the price of the basket in one location to the price of the basket in the other location. For example, if a basket consisting of 1 computer, 1 ton of rice, and 1 ton of steel was 1800 US Dollars in New York and the same goods cost 10800 HK Dollars in Hong Kong, the PPP exchange rate would be 6 HK Dollars for every 1 US Dollar.  \n\nThe name ''purchasing power parity'' comes from the idea that, with the right exchange rate, consumers in every location will have the same [[purchasing power]].\n\nThe value of the PPP exchange rate is very dependent on the basket of goods chosen. In general, goods are chosen that might closely obey the Law of One Price. So, ones traded easily and are commonly available in both locations. Organizations that compute PPP exchange rates use different baskets of goods and can come up with different values.  \n\nThe PPP exchange rate may not match the market exchange rate. The market rate is more [[Volatility (finance)|volatile]] because it reacts to changes in demand at each location. Also, tariffs and difference in the price of labor (see [[Balassa\u2013Samuelson theorem]]) can contribute to longer term differences between the two rates. One use of PPP is to predict longer term exchange rates.\n\nBecause PPP exchange rates are more stable and are less affected by tariffs, they are used for many international comparisons, such as comparing countries' GDPs or other national income statistics. These numbers often come with the label ''PPP-adjusted''. \n\nThere can be marked differences between purchasing power adjusted incomes and those converted via market exchange rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/36a2d566-ad82-11dc-9386-0000779fd2ac.html|title=China, India economies '40% smaller'|first=Scheherazade|last= Daneshkhu|date=18 December 2007|work=Financial Times}}</ref> A well-known purchasing power adjustment is the [[Geary\u2013Khamis dollar]] (the ''international dollar'').

This discrepancy has large implications; for instance, when converted via the nominal exchange rates [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita]] in [[India]] is about [[United States dollar|US$]]1,965<ref>[[List of countries by past and future GDP (nominal)]]</ref> while on a PPP basis it is about US$7,197.<ref>[[List of countries by future GDP (PPP) per capita estimates]]</ref> At the other extreme, for instance [[Denmark|Denmark's]] nominal GDP per capita is around US$53,242, but its PPP figure is US$46,602, in line with other [[developed nations]].\n\n===Variations===\n\nThere are variations to calculating PPP. The EKS method (developed by \u00d6. \u00c9ltet\u0151, P. K\u00f6ves and B. Szulc) uses the [[geometric mean]] of the exchange rates computed for individual goods.<ref>{{cite web |title=EKS Method |url=https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=5525 |publisher=OECD}}</ref> The EKS-S method (by \u00c9ltet\u0151, K\u00f6ves, Szulc, and Sergeev) uses two different baskets, one for each country, and then averages the result.  While these methods work for 2 countries, the exchange rates may be inconsistent if applied to 3 countries, so further adjustment may be necessary so that the rate from currency A to B times the rate from B to C equals the rate from A to C.\n\n===Relative PPP===\n\n{{Main|Relative purchasing power parity}}\n\nRelative PPP is a weaker statement based on the law of one price, covering changes in the exchange rate and inflation rates. It seems to mirror the exchange rate closer than PPP does.<ref name=Burgernomics />\n\n==Usage==\n===Conversion===\n\nPurchasing power parity exchange rate is used when comparing [[Gross domestic product|national production]] and consumption and other places where the prices of non-traded goods are considered important.  (Market exchange rates are used for individual goods that are traded). PPP rates are more stable over time and can be used when that attribute is important.\n\nPPP exchange rates help [[costing]] but exclude profits and above all do not consider the different [[Quality (business)|quality of goods]] among countries. The same product, for instance, can have a different level of quality and even safety in different countries, and may be subject to different taxes and transport costs. Since market exchange rates fluctuate substantially, when the GDP of one country measured in its own currency is converted to the other country's currency using market exchange rates, one country might be inferred to have higher [[real GDP]] than the other country in one year but lower in the other; both of these inferences would fail to reflect the reality of their ''relative levels of production''. But if one country's GDP is converted into the other country's currency using PPP exchange rates instead of observed market exchange rates, the false inference will not occur. Essentially GDP measured at PPP controls for the different costs of living and price levels, usually relative to the United States dollar, enabling a more accurate estimate of a nation's level of production.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| width = 400\n| direction = vertical\n}}\n\nThe exchange rate reflects transaction values for [[tradable goods|traded goods]] ''between'' countries in contrast to non-traded goods, that is, goods produced for home-country use. Also, currencies are traded for purposes other than trade in goods and services, ''e.g.'', to buy [[capital asset]]s whose prices vary more than those of physical goods. Also, different [[interest rate]]s, [[speculation]], [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] or interventions by [[central bank]]s can influence the [[foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange market]].\n\nThe PPP method is used as an alternative to correct for possible statistical bias. The [[Penn World Table]] is a widely cited source of PPP adjustments, and the associated [[Penn effect]] reflects such a [[systematic bias]] in using exchange rates to outputs among countries.\n\nFor example, if the value of the [[Mexican peso]] falls by half compared to the [[US dollar]], the Mexican [[gross domestic product]] measured in dollars will also halve. However, this exchange rate results from international trade and financial markets. It does not necessarily mean that Mexicans are poorer by a half; if incomes and prices measured in pesos stay the same, they will be no worse off assuming that imported goods are not essential to the quality of life of individuals. Measuring income in different countries using PPP exchange rates helps to avoid this problem.\n\n===Exchange rate prediction===\n\nPPP exchange rates are also valued because market exchange rates tend to move in their general direction, over a period of years.  There is some value to knowing in which direction the exchange rate is more likely to shift over the long run.\n\nIn [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] [[economic theory]], the ''purchasing power parity theory'' assumes that the exchange rate between two currencies actually observed in the [[foreign exchange market]] is the one that is used in the purchasing power parity comparisons, so that the same amount of goods could actually be purchased in either currency with the same beginning amount of funds. Depending on the particular theory, purchasing power parity is assumed to hold either in the [[long run]] or, more strongly, in the [[short run]]. Theories that invoke purchasing power parity assume that in some circumstances a fall in either currency's purchasing power(a rise in its price level) would lead to a proportional decrease in that currency's valuation on the foreign exchange market.\n\n===Identifying manipulation===\n\nPPP exchange rates are especially useful when official exchange rates are artificially manipulated by governments. Countries with strong government control of the economy sometimes enforce official exchange rates that make their own currency artificially strong. By contrast, the currency's black market exchange rate is artificially weak. In such cases, a PPP exchange rate is likely the most realistic basis for economic comparison. Similarly, when exchange rates deviate significantly from their long term equilibrium due to speculative attacks or carry trade, a PPP exchange rate offers a better alternative for comparison.\n\nIn 2011, the [[Big Mac Index]] was used to [[Big Mac Index#Manipulation|identify manipulation of inflation numbers by Argentina]].  Argentina responded by manipulating the Big Mac Index.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/24/argentinas-big-mac-attack/|title=Argentina's Big Mac Attack|last=Politi|first=Daniel|date=2011-11-24|website=Latitude|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023175605/https://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/24/argentinas-big-mac-attack/|archive-date=2019-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Issues==\n\nThe PPP exchange-rate calculation is controversial because of the difficulties of finding comparable [[Market basket|baskets of goods]] to compare purchasing power across countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taylor and Taylor|first=Alan and Mark|date=Fall 2004|title=The Purchasing Power Parity Debate|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~mchinn/taylor&taylor_PPP_JEP.pdf|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=18| issue = 4|pages=135\u2013158|via=|doi=10.1257/0895330042632744}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nEstimation of purchasing power parity is complicated by the fact that countries do not simply differ in a uniform [[price level]]; rather, the difference in food prices may be greater than the difference in housing prices, while also less than the difference in entertainment prices. People in different countries typically consume different baskets of goods. It is necessary to compare the cost of baskets of goods and services using a [[price index]]. This is a difficult task because purchasing patterns and even the goods available to purchase differ across countries.\n\nThus, it is necessary to make adjustments for differences in the quality of goods and services. Furthermore, the basket of goods representative of one economy will vary from that of another: Americans eat more bread; Chinese more rice. Hence a PPP calculated using the US consumption as a base will differ from that calculated using China as a base. Additional statistical difficulties arise with multilateral comparisons when(as is usually the case) more than two countries are to be compared.\n\nVarious ways of averaging bilateral PPPs can provide a more stable multilateral comparison, but at the cost of distorting bilateral ones. These are all general issues of indexing; as with other [[price index|price indices]] there is no way to reduce complexity to a single number that is equally satisfying for all purposes. Nevertheless, PPPs are typically robust in the face of the many problems that arise in using market exchange rates to make comparisons.\n\nFor example, in 2005 the price of a gallon of gasoline in Saudi Arabia was US$0.91, and in Norway the price was US$6.27.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/global_gasprices/|work=CNN/Money|title=Global gas prices|date=23 March 2005}}</ref> The significant differences in price would not contribute to accuracy in a PPP analysis, despite all of the variables that contribute to the significant differences in price. More comparisons have to be made and used as variables in the overall formulation of the PPP.\n\nWhen PPP comparisons are to be made over some interval of time, proper account needs to be made of [[inflation]]ary effects.\n\nIn addition to methodological issues presented by the selection of a basket of goods, PPP estimates can also vary based on the statistical capacity of participating countries. The [[International Comparison Program]], which PPP estimates are based on, require the disaggregation of national accounts into production, expenditure or (in some cases) income, and not all participating countries routinely disaggregate their data into such categories.\n\nSome aspects of PPP comparison are theoretically impossible or unclear. For example, there is no basis for comparison between the Ethiopian laborer who lives on teff with the Thai laborer who lives on rice, because teff is not commercially available in Thailand and rice is not in Ethiopia, so the price of rice in Ethiopia or teff in Thailand cannot be determined. As a general rule, the more similar the price structure between countries, the more valid the PPP comparison.\n\nPPP levels will also vary based on the formula used to calculate price matrices. Possible formulas include GEKS-Fisher, Geary-Khamis, IDB, and the superlative method. Each has advantages and disadvantages.\n\nLinking regions presents another methodological difficulty. In the 2005 ICP round, regions were compared by using a list of some 1,000 identical items for which a price could be found for 18 countries, selected so that at least two countries would be in each region. While this was superior to earlier \"bridging\" methods, which do not fully take into account differing quality between goods, it may serve to overstate the PPP basis of poorer countries, because the price indexing on which PPP is based will assign to poorer countries the greater weight of goods consumed in greater shares in richer countries.\n\nThere are a number of reasons that different measures do not perfectly reflect standards of living.\n\n===Range and quality of goods===\nThe goods that the currency has the \"power\" to purchase are a basket of goods of different types:\n# Local, non-tradable goods and services (like electric power) that are produced and sold domestically.\n# Tradable goods such as non-perishable [[Commodity|commodities]] that can be sold on the international market (like [[diamond]]s).\n\nThe more that a product falls into category 1, the further its price will be from the currency [[exchange rate]], moving towards the PPP exchange rate. Conversely, category 2 products tend to trade close to the currency exchange rate. (See also [[Penn effect]]).\n\nMore processed and expensive products are likely to be [[tradable]], falling into the second category, and drifting from the PPP exchange rate to the currency exchange rate. Even if the PPP \"value\" of the Ethiopian currency is three times stronger than the currency exchange rate, it won't buy three times as much of internationally traded goods like steel, cars and microchips, but non-traded goods like housing, services (\"haircuts\"), and domestically produced crops. The relative price differential between tradables and non-tradables from high-income to low-income countries is a consequence of the [[Balassa\u2013Samuelson effect]] and gives a big cost advantage to labour-intensive production of tradable goods in low income countries (like [[Ethiopia]]), as against high income countries (like [[Switzerland]]).\n\nThe corporate cost advantage is nothing more sophisticated than access to cheaper workers, but because the pay of those workers goes farther in low-income countries than high, the relative pay differentials (inter-country) can be sustained for longer than would be the case otherwise. (This is another way of saying that the wage rate is based on average local productivity and that this is below the per capita productivity that factories selling tradable goods to international markets can achieve.) An equivalent [[cost]] benefit comes from non-traded goods that can be sourced locally (nearer the PPP-exchange rate than the nominal exchange rate in which receipts are paid). These act as a cheaper [[factor of production]] than is available to factories in richer countries. It is difficult by GDP PPP to consider the different quality of goods among the countries.\n\nThe Bhagwati\u2013Kravis\u2013Lipsey view provides a somewhat different explanation from the Balassa\u2013Samuelson theory. This view states that price levels for nontradables are lower in poorer countries because of differences in endowment of labor and capital, not because of lower levels of productivity. Poor countries have more labor relative to capital, so marginal productivity of labor is greater in rich countries than in poor countries. Nontradables tend to be labor-intensive; therefore, because labor is less expensive in poor countries and is used mostly for nontradables, nontradables are cheaper in poor countries. Wages are high in rich countries, so nontradables are relatively more expensive.<ref name=\"Krugman\"/>\n\nPPP calculations tend to overemphasise the primary sectoral contribution, and underemphasise the industrial and service sectoral contributions to the economy of a nation.\n\n===Trade barriers and nontradables===\nThe law of one price, the underlying mechanism behind PPP, is weakened by transport costs and governmental trade restrictions, which make it expensive to move goods between markets located in different countries. Transport costs sever the link between exchange rates and the prices of goods implied by the law of one price. As transport costs increase, the larger the range of exchange rate fluctuations. The same is true for official trade restrictions because the customs fees affect importers' profits in the same way as shipping fees. According to Krugman and Obstfeld, \"Either type of trade impediment weakens the basis of PPP by allowing the purchasing power of a given currency to differ more widely from country to country.\"<ref name=Krugman>{{cite book|last=Krugman and Obstfeld|title=International Economics|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|pages=394\u2013395}}</ref>  They cite the example that a dollar in London should purchase the same goods as a dollar in Chicago, which is certainly not the case.\n\nNontradables are primarily services and the output of the construction industry. Nontradables also lead to deviations in PPP because the prices of nontradables are not linked internationally. The prices are determined by domestic supply and demand, and shifts in those curves lead to changes in the market basket of some goods relative to the foreign price of the same basket. If the prices of nontradables rise, the purchasing power of any given currency will fall in that country.<ref name=\"Krugman\"/>\n\n===Departures from free competition===\nLinkages between national price levels are also weakened when trade barriers and imperfectly competitive market structures occur together. Pricing to market occurs when a firm sells the same product for different prices in different markets. This is a reflection of inter-country differences in conditions on both the demand side (''e.g.'', virtually no demand for pork in Islamic states) and the supply side (''e.g.'', whether the existing market for a prospective entrant's product features few suppliers or instead is already near-saturated). According to Krugman and Obstfeld, this occurrence of product differentiation and segmented markets results in violations of the law of one price and absolute PPP. Over time, shifts in market structure and demand will occur, which may invalidate relative PPP.<ref name=\"Krugman\"/>\n\n===Differences in price level measurement===\nMeasurement of price levels differ from country to country. Inflation data from different countries are based on different commodity baskets; therefore, exchange rate changes do not offset official measures of inflation differences. Because it makes predictions about price changes rather than price levels, relative PPP is still a useful concept. However, change in the relative prices of basket components can cause relative PPP to fail tests that are based on official price indexes.<ref name=\"Krugman\"/>\n\n===Global poverty line===\nThe global poverty line is a worldwide count of people who live below an international [[poverty line]], referred to as the dollar-a-day line.

The index was created and popularized by ''[[The Economist]]'' as a way to teach economics and to identify over- and under-valued currencies. \n\nThe Big Mac has the value of being a relatively standardized consumer product that includes input costs from a wide range of sectors in the local economy, such as agricultural commodities (beef, bread, lettuce, cheese), labor (blue and white collar), advertising, rent and real estate costs, transportation, etc.  \n\nThere are some problems with the Big Mac Index.  A Big Mac is perishable and not easily transported.  That means the [[Law of one price|Law of One Price]] is not likely to keep prices the same in different locations.  McDonald's restaurants are not present in every country, which limits the index's usage.  Moreover, Big Macs are not sold at every McDonald's ([[Cattle_slaughter_in_India|noticeably in India]]), which limits its usage further.\n\nIn the white paper, \"Burgernomics\", the authors computed a correlation of 0.73 between the Big Mac Index's prices and prices calculated using the Penn World Tables.  This single-good index captures most, but not all, of the effects captured by more professional (and more complex) PPP measurement.<ref name=Burgernomics />  \n\n''The Economist'' uses The Big Mac Index to identify overvalued and undervalued currencies.  That is, ones where the Big Mac is expense or cheap, when measured using current exchange rates.  The January 2019 article states that a Big Mac costs HK$20.00 in Hong Kong and US$5.58 in the United States.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/2019/01/10/the-big-mac-index|title=The Big Mac index|date=2019-01-10|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-07-02|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>  The implied PPP exchange rate is 3.58 HK$ per US$. The difference between this and the actual exchange rate of 7.83 suggests that the Hong Kong dollar is 54.2% undervalued.  That is, it is cheaper to convert US Dollars into HK$ and buy a Big Mac in Hong Kong than it is to buy a Big Mac directly in US Dollars.\n\n====KFC Index====\n{{Main|KFC Index}}\n\nSimilar to the [[Big Mac Index]], the [[KFC Index]] measures PPP with a basket that contains a single item:  a [[KFC]] Original 12/15 pc. bucket.   The Big Mac Index cannot be used for most countries in Africa because most do not have a McDonald's restaurant.  Thus, the KFC Index was created by Sagaci Research (a [[market research]] firm focusing solely on Africa) to identify over- and under-valued currencies in Africa.  \n\nFor example, the average price of KFC's Original 12 pc. Bucket in the United States in January 2016 was $20.50; while in Namibia it was only $13.40 at market exchange rates. Therefore, the index states the Namibian dollar was undervalued by 33% at that time.\n====iPad Index====\nLike the [[Big Mac Index]], the iPad index (elaborated by [[Commonwealth Securities|CommSec]]) compares an item's price in various locations.  Unlike the Big Mac, however, each iPad is produced in the same place (except for the model sold in Brazil) and all iPads (within the same model) have identical performance characteristics.  Price differences are therefore a function of transportation costs, taxes, and the prices that may be realized in individual markets.  In 2013, an iPad cost about twice as much in Argentina as in the United States.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! Country or region !!

[[Flow cytometry|Flow cytometric]] analysis on the cell cycle of the 9L rat glioma showed that cAMP can arrest the cells in the G1 phase and induces 9L cells into resting position (G0 cells). On the other hand SNAP ([[S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine|S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine]])-induced p53-sensitive cell death and [[DNA fragmentation]] were enhanced and [[Bcl-2]] was decreased by pretreatment with bucladesine (dBc-AMP). Bucladesine induces a decreased Bcl-2 level and enhances [[MPP]]+-induced cell death thus dBc-AMP sensitized the cells to induction of apoptosis.

The members of the other branches added frequently to their surname the name of the place where they chose to live and where a castle was available for their residence. The first of such cases were the Visconti of [[Massino Visconti|Massino]], the Visconti of [[Invorio]] and the Visconti of [[Oleggio Castello]].<ref>{{harvp|Filippini|2014|pages=62\u201363}}</ref> In these localities the castle ([[Visconti Castle (Massino)|Massino]]), its remains ([[Visconti Castle (Invorio)|Invorio]]) or a later reconstruction of the initial building ([[Dal Pozzo Castle|Oleggio Castello]]) are still today visible.\n\n==Lords and Dukes of Milan==\nThe Visconti ruled Milan until the early [[Renaissance]], first as Lords, then, from 1395, with the mighty [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti|Gian Galeazzo]] who endeavored to unify Northern Italy and [[Tuscany]], as [[Duchy of Milan|Dukes]]. Visconti rule in Milan ended with the death of [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] in 1447. He was succeeded by a [[Ambrosian Republic|short-lived republic]] and then by his son-in-law [[Francesco I Sforza]], who established the reign of the [[House of Sforza]].<ref name=\"harvp|Hale|1981|p=338\u2013341, 352\">{{harvp|Hale|1981|p=338\u2013341, 352}}</ref><ref name=\"harvp|Williams|1998|p=33\u201335\">{{harvp|Williams|1998|p=33\u201335}}</ref>\n\n===Rise to the lordship===\nWith the death of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] in 1250 and the ceasing of the war of the [[Lombard League]] against him, which itself was a reason for the Milanese [[Medieval commune|commune]] to be united in its defence, a period of conflicts between rivaling factions began inside the city. The [[Della Torre]] family progressively acquired power in Milan after 1240, when Pagano Della Torre assumed the leadership of the Credenza di Sant'Ambrogio, a political party with a popular base. This allowed them to have a role in the tax collection of the commune (estimo), which was essential to finance the war against Frederick II while affecting the great landowners. In 1247 Pagano was succeeded by his nephew [[Martino della Torre|Martino Della Torre]]. To underline the preeminence of his position, the new role of Senior of the Credenza (Anziano della Credenza) was created. In this position the Della Torre began to be confronted with the Milanese noble families organized in their own political party, the Societas Capitaneorum et Valvassorum, having the Visconti among the most prominent figures. After a period of unrest between the opposite parties, in 1258 the so-called Sant'Ambrogio Peace was signed among the parties, strengthening the position of La Credenza and La Motta (a second political party with popular tendencies).<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=33\u201345}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Menant|2005|page=67}}</ref>\n\nThe peace was undermined by new events in favour of the Della Torre. At the end of 1259, [[Oberto Pallavicino]], a former partisan of Frederick II who got closer to the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] positions of the Della Torre, was appointed by the Milanese commune for five years in the role of General Captain of the People. Pallavicino's position in Milan was greatly enhanced by the victory he obtained in the [[Battle of Cassano (1259)|Battle of Cassano]] on 16 September 1259, against [[Ezzelino III da Romano|Ezzelino da Romano]], formerly his ally on the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]] side in the war against Milan, the Lombard League and the Papacy. In Ezzelino the noble expelled from Milan during the clashes preceding the Sant'Ambrogio Peace placed their hopes to get back in the city to their old power. In 1264, when Pallavicino left his office (preparing another change of alliance), Martino Della Torre remained the sole ruler of Milan and de facto its Lord.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=45\u201351}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Menant|2005|pages=111\u2013112}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Jones|1997|pages=520\u2013521}}</ref> A decisive event in the confrontation between the Della Torre and the Visconti factions was the appointment of [[Ottone Visconti]] to archbishop of Milan in 1262. Ottone was preferred by [[Urban IV|Pope Urban IV]] to [[Raimondo della Torre|Raimondo]], another candidate member of the Della Torre family. Prevented from assuming his office and forced by the opposite faction to remain outside the city, Ottone tried to settle in Arona, at the border of the Milanese archdiocese. At the end of 1263, Della Torre forces with the support of Oberto Pallavicino dislodged him from Arona. Ottone sought refuge in central Italy near the pope. The Della Torre party under the guidance of Filippo Della Torre, brother of Martino and his successor after 1263, took advantage also of the favour of [[Charles I of Anjou|Charles of Anjou]]. Milan forged an alliance with him and with other northern Italian cities (Guelph League) to fight the [[Hohenstaufen]] rule in southern Italy. Francesco Della Torre led the Milanese expedition in southern Italy, which ended in 1266 with the allied victory against [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred of Sicily]] in the [[Battle of Benevento]]. Charles of Anjou became the new [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]], having also an indirect rule (exercised through the Della Torre) on Milan.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=56\u201362}}</ref>\n\nTrying to take advantage from the favourable moment, in 1266 the Della Torre made an attempt to advocate their cause against the Visconti in a [[Consistory court|consistory]] held by [[Pope Clement IV]] in [[Viterbo]] and attended by the archbishop Ottone. Despite the presence of a delegate of Charles of Anjou the decision of the pope was in favour of Ottone. An attempt was then made by the Pope to appease the Milanese factions by means of an oath of allegiance demanded to the Milanese population. Part of it was the acceptance of Ottone as archbishop. The events however were changed again by new circumstances in favour of the Della Torre. At the end of 1266 in Germany was taken the decision to support [[Conradin]], the last member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, in an attempt to recover the domains in southern Italy lost after the defeat of Benevento and the death of Manfred of Sicily. This reinstated again the Della Torre in their position of leaders of the Guelph League. Moreover, in 1268, Clement IV died, initiating a period of papal vacancy that left without practical consequences the dispositions in favour of Ottone.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=64\u201367}}</ref>\n\nAfter the definitive end of the Hohenstaufen threat (Conradin was defeated and executed in Naples in 1268), the confrontation between the two Milanese factions assumed more and more a military connotation. A leading figure on the Visconti side was Simone Orelli da Locarno, whose military ability became legendary during the wars against Fredrick II. Notwithstanding this, being in favour of the Visconti, he was arrested in 1263 and jailed in Milan. In 1276 he was freed in the context of a compromise between the two factions about [[Como]] and after his promise of not acting against the Della Torre. He joined altogether the Visconti army assuming the role of General Captain. The Visconti forces took progressively advantage in the area of Lake Maggiore. In 1276 [[Teobaldo Visconti (1230-1276)|Tebaldo Visconti]], nephew of Ottone, was captured with other leading figures of the Visconti forces. Brought to [[Gallarate]], they were executed by beheading. The Visconti eventually defeated the Della Torre army in the decisive [[Battle of Desio]] on 27 January 1277, opening the way for Ottone to enter in Milan. [[Napoleone della Torre|Napoleone]], son of Pagano, was arrested with other Della Torre family members. He died in jail few months later. These events are generally considered to mark the foundation of the Visconti lordship on Milan.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=67\u201371}}</ref><ref name=\"Jones 619\">{{harvp|Jones|1997|page=619}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ingresso di Ottone Visconti a Milano.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|January 21st 1277, after the victory obtained against the [[Della Torre]] in [[Battle of Desio|Desio]], the archbishop [[Ottone Visconti]] enters in Milan (14th century [[fresco]] in the [[Rocca Borromeo di Angera]])]]\n\nOttone initially granted power in Milan to Simone Orelli, appointing him [[Capitano del popolo|Captain of the People]]. In 1287, he transferred this role to his grandnephew [[Matteo I Visconti|Matteo Visconti]] (the son of Tebaldo executed in 1277), who one year later obtained also the title of [[Imperial vicar]] from the emperor [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf of Habsburg]]. Ottone died in 1295, leaving Matteo Lord of Milan. In 1302, the Della Torre took again the power, forcing Matteo to leave the city. After an intervention of [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], appeasing the dispute between the two families, the lordship of the Visconti on Milan was definitely restored in 1311.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=87\u2013100, 109\u2013124}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Menant|2005|pages=117\u2013118}}</ref><ref name=\"Jones 619\"/>\n\n===Rulers and their families===\n====Matteo, Galeazzo, Azzone, Luchino and Giovanni (1311\u20131354)====\nThe reconciliation agreement with the Della Torre, reached in the December 1310 on the initiative of Henry VII, was attended by Matteo, his brother Uberto and their cousin [[Lodrisio Visconti|Ludovico]], also known as Lodrisio.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=109\u2013114}}</ref> In the following years Matteo acted alone as Lord of Milan and after him the authority on the city and on a growing territory in northern and central Italy was assumed by seven members of his offspring along four generations. Matteo ruled for about eleven years, providing to his family the legal basis for the hereditary lordship on Milan and extending the territory under Milanese influence against the traditional opponents of the Visconti: the Della Torre and [[Counts and dukes of Anjou|Anjou]] dynasties allied with the Papacy. After being accused of [[necromancy]] and [[heresy]], he was convicted by the Church. Looking for a reconciliation, he transferred the power to his eldest son [[Galeazzo I Visconti|Galeazzo]] and left Milan for the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monastery of [[Crescenzago]], where he died in 1322.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=125\u2013131, 142\u2013146, 152}}</ref>\n\nAfter Matteo's death, Galeazzo associated his brothers Marco, [[Luchino Visconti (died 1349)|Luchino]], [[Stefano Visconti|Stefano]], and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni]] (a cleric) in the controls of the inherited domains. He died five years later, succeeded by his son [[Azzone Visconti|Azzone]], who ruled between 1329 and 1339. [[Stefano Visconti|Stefano]], married to Valentina Doria from [[Genoa]], died in 1327 under unclear circumstances. He left three children: [[Matteo II Visconti|Matteo]] (Matteo II), [[Bernab\u00f2 Visconti|Bernab\u00f2]] and [[Galeazzo II Visconti|Galeazzo]] (Galeazzo II). Marco felt in disgrace and was killed by hitmen in 1329. The deaths of two brothers restricted the future successions to Luchino, Giovanni (since 1342 archbishop of Milan) and the three sons of Stefano.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=152\u2013154, 163\u2013164, 173\u2013174}}</ref>\n\nDuring Azzone's rule, Lodrisio (the cousin of Matteo who in 1310 attended the reconciliation with the Della Torre) raised against him trying to revert the line of succession in favour of his own family. He obtained the support of the Della Scala family of [[Verona]], but in 1339, in the [[Battle of Parabiago]], he was defeated by an army led by Azzone and backed by his uncles Luchino and Giovanni. When Azzone died, in 1339, the young age of his sons motivated the transfer of the power to his uncle Luchino, who ruled until his death in 1349. During this period the three sons of Stefano were suspected of a conspiracy against him. The archbishop Giovanni sent them away from Milan, saving them from the possible violent reaction of Luchino.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=189\u2013190, 191\u2013192, 207\u2013210}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Luchino, the power was transferred to Giovanni. Under his rule the territorial expansion continued (to Genoa and [[Bologna]]) as a result of his diplomacy. Part of his initiatives were the marriages of the sons of Stefano to members of the nearby noble dynasties of northern Italy: in 1340 Matteo II to [[Egidiola Gonzaga]], in 1350 Bernab\u00f2 to [[Beatrice Regina della Scala|Regina Della Scala]] and Galeazzo II to [[Bianca of Savoy]].<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=208, 210\u2013213}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=6\u20137}}</ref> In 1353 [[Petrarch]] accepted an invitation of Giovanni and moved to Milan, where he lived until 1361.

Their sons Marco and Carlo married respectively Elisabeth of Bavaria and Beatrice of Armagnac. [[Caterina Visconti|Caterina]], another daughter of Bernab\u00f2, married in 1380 her cousin Gian Galeazzo, widow of Isabelle of Valois, who died in 1373 in Pavia while giving birth to her fourth child.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=292\u2013293, 283\u2013284, 333\u2013334}}</ref>\n\nWhen Galeazzo II died in 1378, his son Gian Galeazzo was the only heir of his half of the Visconti territories. Bernab\u00f2, being 28 years older than his nephew, tended to assume a leading role towards him. The two Visconti had different personalities and ruling styles: instinctive, bad tempered and establisher of a terror regime Bernab\u00f2; circumspect and relatively mild to his subjects Gian Galeazzo. In the following years the relationship between the two Visconti progressively deteriorated.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=284\u2013285}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nFew months after the death of his wife and counselor, Bernab\u00f2 was deposed by his nephew in a coup, probably prepared for years and kept secret. On 5 May 1385, accompanied by his generals ([[Jacopo dal Verme]], Antonio Porro and Guglielmo Bevilacqua) and with a heavy armed escort, Gian Galeazzo moved from Pavia for an apparent pilgrimage journey to Santa Maria del Monte di Velate near [[Varese]]. The following day, passing by Milan, he arranged to meet Bernab\u00f2 for what was expected to be a familiar greeting. Bernab\u00f2, unprotected, was intercepted and arrested. The coup led also to the arrest of two sons of Bernab\u00f2, who were accompanying him.\n\n[[File:L'arresto di Bernab\u00f2 Visconti da parte degli uomini di Gian Galeazzo Visconti.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|May 6th 1385, [[Bernab\u00f2 Visconti]] is arrested by the men of his nephew [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] (19th century engrave)]]\n\nThe people living in the domains of Bernab\u00f2, firstly the Milanese, promptly submitted to Gian Galeazzo, an attitude widely attributed to their desire to abandon the ruthless regime under which they had been living. Incarcerated in his own [[Trezzo sull'Adda Castle|castle at Trezzo sull'Adda]], Bernab\u00f2 died few months later after being submitted a poisoned meal.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=289\u2013302}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=31\u201334}}</ref>\n\n====Gian Galeazzo, sole ruler and Duke of Milan (1385\u20131402)====\nThe death of Bernab\u00f2 left Gian Galeazzo the sole ruler of the Visconti territories. The sons of Bernab\u00f2 arrested with him (Ludovico and Rodolfo) spent the rest of their life in jail; the two still free (Carlo and Mastino) lived far from Milan and never posed a threat to Gian Galeazzo. Only the Della Scala in Verona, the family of their mother, continued to support them, but they ended their life in exile, in [[Bavaria]] and in [[Venice]], after having reached some agreement with their cousin. The younger and unmarried daughters of Bernab\u00f2 (Anglesia, Lucia, Elisabetta) continued their life in Pavia under the care of their sister Caterina, the second wife of Gian Galeazzo, until their wedding.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=333\u2013334, 338}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=144, 171}}</ref>\n\nFor his court, Gian Galeazzo preferred Pavia to Milan. There he continued to develop the renowned library of the castle and to support the [[University of Pavia|local university]]. The relationship between Gian Galeazzo and the French royal family, interrupted by the death of his first wife Isabelle, was revived by their daughter [[Valentina Visconti|Valentina]], who married in 1389 [[Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], brother of [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI, King of France]]. The three sons of Gian Galeazzo and Isabelle died before reaching adulthood.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=325\u2013326, 368\u2013371}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=63\u201368, 79\u201380, 105}}</ref>\n\nGian Galeazzo and Caterina had two sons: [[Gian Maria Visconti|Giovanni Maria]] in 1388 and [[Filippo Maria Visconti|Filippo Maria]] in 1392. In 1395 Gian Galeazzo obtained from the Emperor [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia]], for the price of 100,000 florins, the title of Duke of Milan. During the years of his rule, the Visconti domains reached the greatest territorial extension in northern and central Italy. Of all the domains of the previous years only Genoa, ruled by the archbishop Giovanni, remained excluded. After a short disease, the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] or the [[gout]], Gian Galeazzo died on 3 September 1402.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=3119\u20133323, 379\u2013380}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=173\u2013175, 297\u2013298}}</ref>\n\n====Giovanni Maria and Filippo Maria (1402\u20131447)====\nThe difficulties posed to the Visconti court by the unexpected death of Gian Galeazzo is revealed by the secrecy under which the news of his end was kept. The funeral was held a couple of months after his death. The two sons, being only 12 and 10 years old, remained under the care of their mother Caterina. A Council of Regency with a leading role of [[Facino Cane]], one of the generals of Gian Galeazzo, was set up, but contrasts soon emerged inside it. In 1404 Giovanni Maria formally assumed power. Ruling under the influence of Facino Cane, he forced his mother to leave Milan for [[Monza]]. There, she ended in the hands of two of the illegitimate sons of Bernab\u00f2, who probably caused her death.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=382\u2013395}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=298\u2013301}}</ref>\n\nWith Giovanni Maria a period of political crisis began. The policy of Facino Cane, who for himself obtained the title of Count of [[Biandrate]], favoured the local powers and led to the fragmentation of the territorial unity. Peripheral regions were lost to nearby powers. This situation ended in 1412 with the death of Facino Cane. Few months later a conspiracy against Giovanni Maria ended his reign and life. In the same year, his brother Filippo Maria married the widow of Facino Cane, the 42-year-old [[Beatrice Lascaris di Tenda|Beatrice of Tenda]], taking advantage of a testamentary disposition in favour of any Visconti that would have married her. The marriage ended with the accusation of adultery to Beatrice, her incarceration and the sentence to death, carried out in the [[Visconti Castle (Binasco)|Binasco castle]] in 1418.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=397\u2013414, 415\u2013416}}</ref>\n\nIn 1428 Filippo Maria secondly married [[Marie of Savoy, Duchess of Milan|Mary of Savoy]], but they never had sons. In 1425 his mistress [[Agnese del Maino|Agnese Del Maino]] gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, [[Bianca Maria Visconti|Bianca Maria]]. Considered by his father his only heir, she grew up with her mother in the [[Visconti Castle (Abbiategrasso)|Abbiategrasso]] and [[Visconti Castle (Cusago)|Cusago]] castles.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=452\u2013453, 457}}</ref> In 1432 Bianca Maria was betrothed to [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]], a condottiero of Filippo Maria. In 1441 she married him, granting him the succession of the Duchy of Milan. A sign of their marriage is visible today in the twin churches of [[Santa Maria Incoronata, Milan|Santa Maria Incoronata]] in Milan.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=457, 484\u2013486}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Facciata Santa Maria Incoronata.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The twin fa\u00e7ades of [[Santa Maria Incoronata, Milan|Santa Maria Incoronata]] in Milan reveals the addition of a second church, erected by [[Bianca Maria Visconti]] as a sign of the indissolubility of her marriage to [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]], builder of the original church]]\n\n====The heirs of Bianca Maria and Valentina, dukes of Milan (1450\u20131535) ====\nAfter the death of Filippo Maria in 1447 and the short-lived [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]], in 1450 Francesco Sforza became the new Duke of Milan.

After his death and the short rule of [[Maximilian Sforza]] (1512\u20131515), the Duchy was inherited by his cousin [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. After France was defeated by an Imperial-Spanish army in the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, the rule on Milan was assumed again by a Sforza, [[Francesco II Sforza|Francesco II]]. His death and a [[Italian War of 1536\u201338|new war]] led the Duchy of Milan in the hands of [[Philip II of Spain]], bringing to an end the line of succession initiated by Ottone and Matteo Visconti.\n\n===Political developments and territorial hegemony of Milan===\nUnder the rule of the Visconti, the government of the city of Milan underwent profound transformations while its territorial hegemony greatly extended, to suffer a crisis after the death of Gian Galeazzo.\n\nThe lordship of Ottone and Matteo brought to an end the confrontation between noble and popular parties, which had assumed growing violent forms in Milan during the 13th century. The new power of the Visconti relied initially on the combined roles of Archbishop (Ottone) and Captain of the People, along with the authority deriving from the title of Imperial Vicar (Matteo). After Matteo, the rule in the city assumed hereditary nature inside his family, making unnecessary any formal recognition by the communal institutions. The first Visconti claimed an absolute power (''plenitudo potestatis'') comparable to the one preserved to pope and emperor,<ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=38\u201356}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|pages=21\u201323}}</ref> culminating with Bernab\u00f2, who openly considered their authorities irrelevant in his dominions.<ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=52\u201353}}</ref> The political change in Milan was part of the general decline of the Commune and the subsequent rise of the [[Signoria]] that affected northern and central Italy along the 13th and 14th centuries.<ref>{{harvp|Jones|1997|pages=152\u2013650}}</ref>\n\nThe annexation of the properties of the Milanese church, which included fortifications like the [[Rocca Borromeo di Angera|Angera]] and Arona castles guarding the Lake Maggiore, was the first step taken by Matteo Visconti to consolidate his power in the territory of the Milanese diocese. This originated a conflict with the Papacy that lasted along the following decades.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|page=132}}</ref><ref name=\"harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=24\">{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=24}}</ref> The expansion of the Visconti rule outside the Milanese diocese took advantage of the traditional importance of Milan in northern Italy, reinforced by the leading role played in the Lombard League during the wars against the Hohenstaufen emperors.<ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|pages=19\u201320}}</ref> After the destructions inflicted by Frederick Barbarossa in 1162, in few years the Milanese reconstructed their city and defeated the emperor at [[Battle of Legnano|Legnano]] in 1176, forcing him to the [[Peace of Constance]], which granted autonomy also to the cities allied to Milan.

Regimes in favour of the Visconti were installed in [[Como]], [[Novara]] and Pavia. During this first expansion phase, the Visconti continued to face the opposition of the Guelph League: the Papacy, the Anjou house (sovereigns in southern Italy) and the Della Torre family.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=132\u2013168}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|pages=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Visconti XIV century.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|The Visconti dominions around the middle of the 14th century]]\n\nAfter a crisis suffered during the years of Galeazzo I, the expansion continued under the lordship of Azzone with the military support of his uncle Luchino. In 1334 [[Cremona]] surrendered to Azzone. In 1337 Luchino entered in [[Brescia]], allowing Azzone to become Lord of the city. In 1339 Azzone and Luchino defeated in the battle of Parabiago an army formed by their cousin Lodrisio Visconti and the Della Scala family, lords of Verona. In 1341, under the lordship of Luchino, a reconciliation with the Church was reached. In 1346 Luchino took [[Parma]] and in 1347 he extended the western border of the Visconti dominions along a stretch of land until [[Mondov\u00ec]] and [[Cuneo]], at the foot of the [[Western Alps]].<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=191\u2013205}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=38\u201342}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=39}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Luchino, the archbishop Giovanni further extended the territories under Milanese control. In 1350 he obtained Bologna from the [[Pepoli|Pepoli family]] and in 1353 he accepted the lordship of Genoa. Through the marriages of his nephews (Matteo II, Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II), he linked dynastically the Visconti to the families ruling the territories to the west and east of the Visconti dominions: the Gonzaga, the Della Scala and the [[House of Savoy|Savoy]]. The acquisition of Bologna, a city belonging to the territory of the [[Papal States]], reopened the conflict with the pope. In 1352, negotiation with the papal envoy, the abbot [[Pope Urban V|Guillaume de Grimoard]] (later Pope Urban V), led to an agreement that allowed Giovanni to continue to rule on Bologna as papal vicar.<ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=6\u20137}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=42\u201343}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=207\u2013234}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=30}}</ref>\n\nThe death of the archbishop Giovanni in 1354 and the transfer of power to Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II were followed by a reaction in Genoa and Bologna. In 1356 Genoa regained its independence. In Bologna, the rebellion of Giovanni Visconti di Oleggio, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the Archbishop Giovanni and his lieutenant in the city, opened the way to the intervention of the [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who in 1360 brought back the city within the Papal States. Bernab\u00f2, ruler of the eastern portion of the Visconti dominions, tried repeatedly to recover Bologna. This, among other disputes with the Church, cost him a sentence of excommunication by [[Pope Innocent VI]]. After his defeat in the Battle of San Ruffillo in 1361, Bernab\u00f2 finally came to term with the loss of Bologna.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=239\u2013240, 248\u2013253}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=51\u201352}}</ref> Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II engaged bitter clashes also with the imperial authority. After the [[List of rulers of Montferrat|marquess of Monferrato]] was appointed imperial vicar in Pavia by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], the relationship between the emperor and the Visconti deteriorated. In November 1356, in the Battle of [[Casorate Primo|Casorate]], Visconti forces under the command of Lodrisio Visconti (now reconciled with his cousins) defeated an imperial army and captured its commander, [[Marquard of Randeck]]. In 1359, Pavia definitely surrendered to Galeazzo II.<ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=7\u20138}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=241\u2013244}}</ref> His decision to erect a vast [[Visconti Castle (Pavia)|castle in Pavia]] and to establish there his court was a sign of the ambition of the Visconti to extend their dominions to the area of the ancient Lombard Kingdom.\n\nIn the 1370s, Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II emerged without severe consequences from manifold simultaneous attacks. The two brothers were deprived by the emperor of their vicariate and condemned by the Pope Gregory XI as heretics. They subsequently suffered military incursions from the eastern border (by the count of Savoy) and from Bologna (by Papal-Florentine forces), which ended without significant impacts. A peace with the pope and a reconciliation with the count of Savoy  followed, while [[Florence]] turned against the pope in a [[War of the Eight Saints|new war]].<ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=8\u20139}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=52\u201354}}</ref> The years of Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II were marked also by the extension of their matrimonial policies.

The primary role of Ottone in the political life of the Milanese [[Medieval commune|commune]] emerges in the period of the confrontation with [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]]: his name is the first to be cited, March 1, 1162, in the group of Milanese leaders surrendering to the emperor after the capitulation of the city that took place in the previous weeks.<ref>{{harvp|Filippini|2014|pages=100\u2013101}}</ref><ref>{{harvp |Morena |Morena |1994 |p=[https://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00000687/images/index.html?id=00000687&nativeno=152 152]}}</ref> A member of the following generation, [[Ariprando Visconti, bishop of Vercelli|Ariprando]] was bishop of [[Vercelli]] between 1208 and 1213, when he played also the role of [[Papal legate]] for [[Innocent III]].

The members of the other branches added frequently to their surname the name of the place where they chose to live and where a castle was available for their residence. The first of such cases were the Visconti of [[Massino Visconti|Massino]], the Visconti of [[Invorio]] and the Visconti of [[Oleggio Castello]].<ref>{{harvp|Filippini|2014|pages=62\u201363}}</ref> In these localities the castle ([[Visconti Castle (Massino)|Massino]]), its remains ([[Visconti Castle (Invorio)|Invorio]]) or a later reconstruction of the initial building ([[Dal Pozzo Castle|Oleggio Castello]]) are still today visible.\n\n==Lords and Dukes of Milan==\nThe Visconti ruled Milan until the early [[Renaissance]], first as Lords, then, from 1395, with the mighty [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti|Gian Galeazzo]] who endeavored to unify Northern Italy and [[Tuscany]], as [[Duchy of Milan|Dukes]]. Visconti rule in Milan ended with the death of [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] in 1447. He was succeeded by a [[Ambrosian Republic|short-lived republic]] and then by his son-in-law [[Francesco I Sforza]], who established the reign of the [[House of Sforza]].<ref name=\"harvp|Hale|1981|p=338\u2013341, 352\">{{harvp|Hale|1981|p=338\u2013341, 352}}</ref><ref name=\"harvp|Williams|1998|p=33\u201335\">{{harvp|Williams|1998|p=33\u201335}}</ref>\n\n===Rise to the lordship===\nWith the death of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] in 1250 and the ceasing of the war of the [[Lombard League]] against him, which itself was a reason for the Milanese [[Medieval commune|commune]] to be united in its defence, a period of conflicts between rivaling factions began inside the city. The [[Della Torre]] family progressively acquired power in Milan after 1240, when Pagano Della Torre assumed the leadership of the Credenza di Sant'Ambrogio, a political party with a popular base. This allowed them to have a role in the tax collection of the commune (estimo), which was essential to finance the war against Frederick II while affecting the great landowners. In 1247 Pagano was succeeded by his nephew [[Martino della Torre|Martino Della Torre]]. To underline the preeminence of his position, the new role of Senior of the Credenza (Anziano della Credenza) was created. In this position the Della Torre began to be confronted with the Milanese noble families organized in their own political party, the Societas Capitaneorum et Valvassorum, having the Visconti among the most prominent figures. After a period of unrest between the opposite parties, in 1258 the so-called Sant'Ambrogio Peace was signed among the parties, strengthening the position of La Credenza and La Motta (a second political party with popular tendencies).<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=33\u201345}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Menant|2005|page=67}}</ref>\n\nThe peace was undermined by new events in favour of the Della Torre. At the end of 1259, [[Oberto Pallavicino]], a former partisan of Frederick II who got closer to the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] positions of the Della Torre, was appointed by the Milanese commune for five years in the role of General Captain of the People. Pallavicino's position in Milan was greatly enhanced by the victory he obtained in the [[Battle of Cassano (1259)|Battle of Cassano]] on 16 September 1259, against [[Ezzelino III da Romano|Ezzelino da Romano]], formerly his ally on the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]] side in the war against Milan, the Lombard League and the Papacy. In Ezzelino the noble expelled from Milan during the clashes preceding the Sant'Ambrogio Peace placed their hopes to get back in the city to their old power. In 1264, when Pallavicino left his office (preparing another change of alliance), Martino Della Torre remained the sole ruler of Milan and de facto its Lord.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=45\u201351}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Menant|2005|pages=111\u2013112}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Jones|1997|pages=520\u2013521}}</ref> A decisive event in the confrontation between the Della Torre and the Visconti factions was the appointment of [[Ottone Visconti]] to archbishop of Milan in 1262. Ottone was preferred by [[Urban IV|Pope Urban IV]] to [[Raimondo della Torre|Raimondo]], another candidate member of the Della Torre family. Prevented from assuming his office and forced by the opposite faction to remain outside the city, Ottone tried to settle in Arona, at the border of the Milanese archdiocese. At the end of 1263, Della Torre forces with the support of Oberto Pallavicino dislodged him from Arona. Ottone sought refuge in central Italy near the pope. The Della Torre party under the guidance of Filippo Della Torre, brother of Martino and his successor after 1263, took advantage also of the favour of [[Charles I of Anjou|Charles of Anjou]]. Milan forged an alliance with him and with other northern Italian cities (Guelph League) to fight the [[Hohenstaufen]] rule in southern Italy. Francesco Della Torre led the Milanese expedition in southern Italy, which ended in 1266 with the allied victory against [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred of Sicily]] in the [[Battle of Benevento]]. Charles of Anjou became the new [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]], having also an indirect rule (exercised through the Della Torre) on Milan.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=56\u201362}}</ref>\n\nTrying to take advantage from the favourable moment, in 1266 the Della Torre made an attempt to advocate their cause against the Visconti in a [[Consistory court|consistory]] held by [[Pope Clement IV]] in [[Viterbo]] and attended by the archbishop Ottone. Despite the presence of a delegate of Charles of Anjou the decision of the pope was in favour of Ottone. An attempt was then made by the Pope to appease the Milanese factions by means of an oath of allegiance demanded to the Milanese population. Part of it was the acceptance of Ottone as archbishop. The events however were changed again by new circumstances in favour of the Della Torre. At the end of 1266 in Germany was taken the decision to support [[Conradin]], the last member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, in an attempt to recover the domains in southern Italy lost after the defeat of Benevento and the death of Manfred of Sicily. This reinstated again the Della Torre in their position of leaders of the Guelph League. Moreover, in 1268, Clement IV died, initiating a period of papal vacancy that left without practical consequences the dispositions in favour of Ottone.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=64\u201367}}</ref>\n\nAfter the definitive end of the Hohenstaufen threat (Conradin was defeated and executed in Naples in 1268), the confrontation between the two Milanese factions assumed more and more a military connotation. A leading figure on the Visconti side was Simone Orelli da Locarno, whose military ability became legendary during the wars against Fredrick II. Notwithstanding this, being in favour of the Visconti, he was arrested in 1263 and jailed in Milan. In 1276 he was freed in the context of a compromise between the two factions about [[Como]] and after his promise of not acting against the Della Torre. He joined altogether the Visconti army assuming the role of General Captain. The Visconti forces took progressively advantage in the area of Lake Maggiore. In 1276 [[Teobaldo Visconti (1230-1276)|Tebaldo Visconti]], nephew of Ottone, was captured with other leading figures of the Visconti forces. Brought to [[Gallarate]], they were executed by beheading. The Visconti eventually defeated the Della Torre army in the decisive [[Battle of Desio]] on 27 January 1277, opening the way for Ottone to enter in Milan. [[Napoleone della Torre|Napoleone]], son of Pagano, was arrested with other Della Torre family members. He died in jail few months later. These events are generally considered to mark the foundation of the Visconti lordship on Milan.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=67\u201371}}</ref><ref name=\"Jones 619\">{{harvp|Jones|1997|page=619}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ingresso di Ottone Visconti a Milano.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|January 21st 1277, after the victory obtained against the [[Della Torre]] in [[Battle of Desio|Desio]], the archbishop [[Ottone Visconti]] enters in Milan (14th century [[fresco]] in the [[Rocca Borromeo di Angera]])]]\n\nOttone initially granted power in Milan to Simone Orelli, appointing him [[Capitano del popolo|Captain of the People]]. In 1287, he transferred this role to his grandnephew [[Matteo I Visconti|Matteo Visconti]] (the son of Tebaldo executed in 1277), who one year later obtained also the title of [[Imperial vicar]] from the emperor [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf of Habsburg]]. Ottone died in 1295, leaving Matteo Lord of Milan. In 1302, the Della Torre took again the power, forcing Matteo to leave the city. After an intervention of [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], appeasing the dispute between the two families, the lordship of the Visconti on Milan was definitely restored in 1311.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=87\u2013100, 109\u2013124}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Menant|2005|pages=117\u2013118}}</ref><ref name=\"Jones 619\"/>\n\n===Rulers and their families===\n====Matteo, Galeazzo, Azzone, Luchino and Giovanni (1311\u20131354)====\nThe reconciliation agreement with the Della Torre, reached in the December 1310 on the initiative of Henry VII, was attended by Matteo, his brother Uberto and their cousin [[Lodrisio Visconti|Ludovico]], also known as Lodrisio.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=109\u2013114}}</ref> In the following years Matteo acted alone as Lord of Milan and after him the authority on the city and on a growing territory in northern and central Italy was assumed by seven members of his offspring along four generations. Matteo ruled for about eleven years, providing to his family the legal basis for the hereditary lordship on Milan and extending the territory under Milanese influence against the traditional opponents of the Visconti: the Della Torre and [[Counts and dukes of Anjou|Anjou]] dynasties allied with the Papacy. After being accused of [[necromancy]] and [[heresy]], he was convicted by the Church. Looking for a reconciliation, he transferred the power to his eldest son [[Galeazzo I Visconti|Galeazzo]] and left Milan for the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monastery of [[Crescenzago]], where he died in 1322.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=125\u2013131, 142\u2013146, 152}}</ref>\n\nAfter Matteo's death, Galeazzo associated his brothers Marco, [[Luchino Visconti (died 1349)|Luchino]], [[Stefano Visconti|Stefano]], and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni]] (a cleric) in the controls of the inherited domains. He died five years later, succeeded by his son [[Azzone Visconti|Azzone]], who ruled between 1329 and 1339. [[Stefano Visconti|Stefano]], married to Valentina Doria from [[Genoa]], died in 1327 under unclear circumstances. He left three children: [[Matteo II Visconti|Matteo]] (Matteo II), [[Bernab\u00f2 Visconti|Bernab\u00f2]] and [[Galeazzo II Visconti|Galeazzo]] (Galeazzo II). Marco felt in disgrace and was killed by hitmen in 1329. The deaths of two brothers restricted the future successions to Luchino, Giovanni (since 1342 archbishop of Milan) and the three sons of Stefano.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=152\u2013154, 163\u2013164, 173\u2013174}}</ref>\n\nDuring Azzone's rule, Lodrisio (the cousin of Matteo who in 1310 attended the reconciliation with the Della Torre) raised against him trying to revert the line of succession in favour of his own family. He obtained the support of the Della Scala family of [[Verona]], but in 1339, in the [[Battle of Parabiago]], he was defeated by an army led by Azzone and backed by his uncles Luchino and Giovanni. When Azzone died, in 1339, the young age of his sons motivated the transfer of the power to his uncle Luchino, who ruled until his death in 1349. During this period the three sons of Stefano were suspected of a conspiracy against him. The archbishop Giovanni sent them away from Milan, saving them from the possible violent reaction of Luchino.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=189\u2013190, 191\u2013192, 207\u2013210}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Luchino, the power was transferred to Giovanni. Under his rule the territorial expansion continued (to Genoa and [[Bologna]]) as a result of his diplomacy. Part of his initiatives were the marriages of the sons of Stefano to members of the nearby noble dynasties of northern Italy: in 1340 Matteo II to [[Egidiola Gonzaga]], in 1350 Bernab\u00f2 to [[Beatrice Regina della Scala|Regina Della Scala]] and Galeazzo II to [[Bianca of Savoy]].<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=208, 210\u2013213}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=6\u20137}}</ref> In 1353 [[Petrarch]] accepted an invitation of Giovanni and moved to Milan, where he lived until 1361.

Their sons Marco and Carlo married respectively Elisabeth of Bavaria and Beatrice of Armagnac. [[Caterina Visconti|Caterina]], another daughter of Bernab\u00f2, married in 1380 her cousin Gian Galeazzo, widow of Isabelle of Valois, who died in 1373 in Pavia while giving birth to her fourth child.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=292\u2013293, 283\u2013284, 333\u2013334}}</ref>\n\nWhen Galeazzo II died in 1378, his son Gian Galeazzo was the only heir of his half of the Visconti territories. Bernab\u00f2, being 28 years older than his nephew, tended to assume a leading role towards him. The two Visconti had different personalities and ruling styles: instinctive, bad tempered and establisher of a terror regime Bernab\u00f2; circumspect and relatively mild to his subjects Gian Galeazzo. In the following years the relationship between the two Visconti progressively deteriorated.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=284\u2013285}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nFew months after the death of his wife and counselor, Bernab\u00f2 was deposed by his nephew in a coup, probably prepared for years and kept secret. On 5 May 1385, accompanied by his generals ([[Jacopo dal Verme]], Antonio Porro and Guglielmo Bevilacqua) and with a heavy armed escort, Gian Galeazzo moved from Pavia for an apparent pilgrimage journey to Santa Maria del Monte di Velate near [[Varese]]. The following day, passing by Milan, he arranged to meet Bernab\u00f2 for what was expected to be a familiar greeting. Bernab\u00f2, unprotected, was intercepted and arrested. The coup led also to the arrest of two sons of Bernab\u00f2, who were accompanying him.\n\n[[File:L'arresto di Bernab\u00f2 Visconti da parte degli uomini di Gian Galeazzo Visconti.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|May 6th 1385, [[Bernab\u00f2 Visconti]] is arrested by the men of his nephew [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] (19th century engrave)]]\n\nThe people living in the domains of Bernab\u00f2, firstly the Milanese, promptly submitted to Gian Galeazzo, an attitude widely attributed to their desire to abandon the ruthless regime under which they had been living. Incarcerated in his own [[Trezzo sull'Adda Castle|castle at Trezzo sull'Adda]], Bernab\u00f2 died few months later after being submitted a poisoned meal.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=289\u2013302}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=31\u201334}}</ref>\n\n====Gian Galeazzo, sole ruler and Duke of Milan (1385\u20131402)====\nThe death of Bernab\u00f2 left Gian Galeazzo the sole ruler of the Visconti territories. The sons of Bernab\u00f2 arrested with him (Ludovico and Rodolfo) spent the rest of their life in jail; the two still free (Carlo and Mastino) lived far from Milan and never posed a threat to Gian Galeazzo. Only the Della Scala in Verona, the family of their mother, continued to support them, but they ended their life in exile, in [[Bavaria]] and in [[Venice]], after having reached some agreement with their cousin. The younger and unmarried daughters of Bernab\u00f2 (Anglesia, Lucia, Elisabetta) continued their life in Pavia under the care of their sister Caterina, the second wife of Gian Galeazzo, until their wedding.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=333\u2013334, 338}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=144, 171}}</ref>\n\nFor his court, Gian Galeazzo preferred Pavia to Milan. There he continued to develop the renowned library of the castle and to support the [[University of Pavia|local university]]. The relationship between Gian Galeazzo and the French royal family, interrupted by the death of his first wife Isabelle, was revived by their daughter [[Valentina Visconti|Valentina]], who married in 1389 [[Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], brother of [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI, King of France]]. The three sons of Gian Galeazzo and Isabelle died before reaching adulthood.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=325\u2013326, 368\u2013371}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=63\u201368, 79\u201380, 105}}</ref>\n\nGian Galeazzo and Caterina had two sons: [[Gian Maria Visconti|Giovanni Maria]] in 1388 and [[Filippo Maria Visconti|Filippo Maria]] in 1392. In 1395 Gian Galeazzo obtained from the Emperor [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia]], for the price of 100,000 florins, the title of Duke of Milan. During the years of his rule, the Visconti domains reached the greatest territorial extension in northern and central Italy. Of all the domains of the previous years only Genoa, ruled by the archbishop Giovanni, remained excluded. After a short disease, the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] or the [[gout]], Gian Galeazzo died on 3 September 1402.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=3119\u20133323, 379\u2013380}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=173\u2013175, 297\u2013298}}</ref>\n\n====Giovanni Maria and Filippo Maria (1402\u20131447)====\nThe difficulties posed to the Visconti court by the unexpected death of Gian Galeazzo is revealed by the secrecy under which the news of his end was kept. The funeral was held a couple of months after his death. The two sons, being only 12 and 10 years old, remained under the care of their mother Caterina. A Council of Regency with a leading role of [[Facino Cane]], one of the generals of Gian Galeazzo, was set up, but contrasts soon emerged inside it. In 1404 Giovanni Maria formally assumed power. Ruling under the influence of Facino Cane, he forced his mother to leave Milan for [[Monza]]. There, she ended in the hands of two of the illegitimate sons of Bernab\u00f2, who probably caused her death.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=382\u2013395}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=298\u2013301}}</ref>\n\nWith Giovanni Maria a period of political crisis began. The policy of Facino Cane, who for himself obtained the title of Count of [[Biandrate]], favoured the local powers and led to the fragmentation of the territorial unity. Peripheral regions were lost to nearby powers. This situation ended in 1412 with the death of Facino Cane. Few months later a conspiracy against Giovanni Maria ended his reign and life. In the same year, his brother Filippo Maria married the widow of Facino Cane, the 42-year-old [[Beatrice Lascaris di Tenda|Beatrice of Tenda]], taking advantage of a testamentary disposition in favour of any Visconti that would have married her. The marriage ended with the accusation of adultery to Beatrice, her incarceration and the sentence to death, carried out in the [[Visconti Castle (Binasco)|Binasco castle]] in 1418.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=397\u2013414, 415\u2013416}}</ref>\n\nIn 1428 Filippo Maria secondly married [[Marie of Savoy, Duchess of Milan|Mary of Savoy]], but they never had sons. In 1425 his mistress [[Agnese del Maino|Agnese Del Maino]] gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, [[Bianca Maria Visconti|Bianca Maria]]. Considered by his father his only heir, she grew up with her mother in the [[Visconti Castle (Abbiategrasso)|Abbiategrasso]] and [[Visconti Castle (Cusago)|Cusago]] castles.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=452\u2013453, 457}}</ref> In 1432 Bianca Maria was betrothed to [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]], a condottiero of Filippo Maria. In 1441 she married him, granting him the succession of the Duchy of Milan. A sign of their marriage is visible today in the twin churches of [[Santa Maria Incoronata, Milan|Santa Maria Incoronata]] in Milan.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=457, 484\u2013486}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Facciata Santa Maria Incoronata.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The twin fa\u00e7ades of [[Santa Maria Incoronata, Milan|Santa Maria Incoronata]] in Milan reveals the addition of a second church, erected by [[Bianca Maria Visconti]] as a sign of the indissolubility of her marriage to [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]], builder of the original church]]\n\n====The heirs of Bianca Maria and Valentina, dukes of Milan (1450\u20131535) ====\nAfter the death of Filippo Maria in 1447 and the short-lived [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]], in 1450 Francesco Sforza became the new Duke of Milan. Bianca Maria and her husband initiated [[House of Sforza|a new dynasty]] that ruled Milan discontinuously until 1535.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=528\u2013540, 541\u2013547}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Louis XII of France]] entered Milan in 1499 after the [[Italian War of 1494\u201398|First Italian War]], he leveraged on a clause of the marriage contract of his grandmother Valentina, the daughter of Gian Galeazzo, and assumed the title of Duke of Milan. After his death and the short rule of [[Maximilian Sforza]] (1512\u20131515), the Duchy was inherited by his cousin [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. After France was defeated by an Imperial-Spanish army in the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, the rule on Milan was assumed again by a Sforza, [[Francesco II Sforza|Francesco II]]. His death and a [[Italian War of 1536\u201338|new war]] led the Duchy of Milan in the hands of [[Philip II of Spain]], bringing to an end the line of succession initiated by Ottone and Matteo Visconti.\n\n===Political developments and territorial hegemony of Milan===\nUnder the rule of the Visconti, the government of the city of Milan underwent profound transformations while its territorial hegemony greatly extended, to suffer a crisis after the death of Gian Galeazzo.\n\nThe lordship of Ottone and Matteo brought to an end the confrontation between noble and popular parties, which had assumed growing violent forms in Milan during the 13th century. The new power of the Visconti relied initially on the combined roles of Archbishop (Ottone) and Captain of the People, along with the authority deriving from the title of Imperial Vicar (Matteo). After Matteo, the rule in the city assumed hereditary nature inside his family, making unnecessary any formal recognition by the communal institutions. The first Visconti claimed an absolute power (''plenitudo potestatis'') comparable to the one preserved to pope and emperor,<ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=38\u201356}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|pages=21\u201323}}</ref> culminating with Bernab\u00f2, who openly considered their authorities irrelevant in his dominions.<ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=52\u201353}}</ref> The political change in Milan was part of the general decline of the Commune and the subsequent rise of the [[Signoria]] that affected northern and central Italy along the 13th and 14th centuries.<ref>{{harvp|Jones|1997|pages=152\u2013650}}</ref>\n\nThe annexation of the properties of the Milanese church, which included fortifications like the [[Rocca Borromeo di Angera|Angera]] and Arona castles guarding the Lake Maggiore, was the first step taken by Matteo Visconti to consolidate his power in the territory of the Milanese diocese. This originated a conflict with the Papacy that lasted along the following decades.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|page=132}}</ref><ref name=\"harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=24\">{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=24}}</ref> The expansion of the Visconti rule outside the Milanese diocese took advantage of the traditional importance of Milan in northern Italy, reinforced by the leading role played in the Lombard League during the wars against the Hohenstaufen emperors.<ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|pages=19\u201320}}</ref> After the destructions inflicted by Frederick Barbarossa in 1162, in few years the Milanese reconstructed their city and defeated the emperor at [[Battle of Legnano|Legnano]] in 1176, forcing him to the [[Peace of Constance]], which granted autonomy also to the cities allied to Milan.

Regimes in favour of the Visconti were installed in [[Como]], [[Novara]] and Pavia. During this first expansion phase, the Visconti continued to face the opposition of the Guelph League: the Papacy, the Anjou house (sovereigns in southern Italy) and the Della Torre family.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=132\u2013168}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|pages=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Visconti XIV century.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|The Visconti dominions around the middle of the 14th century]]\n\nAfter a crisis suffered during the years of Galeazzo I, the expansion continued under the lordship of Azzone with the military support of his uncle Luchino. In 1334 [[Cremona]] surrendered to Azzone. In 1337 Luchino entered in [[Brescia]], allowing Azzone to become Lord of the city. In 1339 Azzone and Luchino defeated in the battle of Parabiago an army formed by their cousin Lodrisio Visconti and the Della Scala family, lords of Verona. In 1341, under the lordship of Luchino, a reconciliation with the Church was reached. In 1346 Luchino took [[Parma]] and in 1347 he extended the western border of the Visconti dominions along a stretch of land until [[Mondov\u00ec]] and [[Cuneo]], at the foot of the [[Western Alps]].<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=191\u2013205}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=38\u201342}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=39}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Luchino, the archbishop Giovanni further extended the territories under Milanese control. In 1350 he obtained Bologna from the [[Pepoli|Pepoli family]] and in 1353 he accepted the lordship of Genoa. Through the marriages of his nephews (Matteo II, Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II), he linked dynastically the Visconti to the families ruling the territories to the west and east of the Visconti dominions: the Gonzaga, the Della Scala and the [[House of Savoy|Savoy]]. The acquisition of Bologna, a city belonging to the territory of the [[Papal States]], reopened the conflict with the pope. In 1352, negotiation with the papal envoy, the abbot [[Pope Urban V|Guillaume de Grimoard]] (later Pope Urban V), led to an agreement that allowed Giovanni to continue to rule on Bologna as papal vicar.<ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=6\u20137}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=42\u201343}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=207\u2013234}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=30}}</ref>\n\nThe death of the archbishop Giovanni in 1354 and the transfer of power to Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II were followed by a reaction in Genoa and Bologna. In 1356 Genoa regained its independence. In Bologna, the rebellion of Giovanni Visconti di Oleggio, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the Archbishop Giovanni and his lieutenant in the city, opened the way to the intervention of the [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who in 1360 brought back the city within the Papal States. Bernab\u00f2, ruler of the eastern portion of the Visconti dominions, tried repeatedly to recover Bologna. This, among other disputes with the Church, cost him a sentence of excommunication by [[Pope Innocent VI]]. After his defeat in the Battle of San Ruffillo in 1361, Bernab\u00f2 finally came to term with the loss of Bologna.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=239\u2013240, 248\u2013253}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=51\u201352}}</ref> Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II engaged bitter clashes also with the imperial authority. After the [[List of rulers of Montferrat|marquess of Monferrato]] was appointed imperial vicar in Pavia by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], the relationship between the emperor and the Visconti deteriorated. In November 1356, in the Battle of [[Casorate Primo|Casorate]], Visconti forces under the command of Lodrisio Visconti (now reconciled with his cousins) defeated an imperial army and captured its commander, [[Marquard of Randeck]]. In 1359, Pavia definitely surrendered to Galeazzo II.<ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=7\u20138}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=241\u2013244}}</ref> His decision to erect a vast [[Visconti Castle (Pavia)|castle in Pavia]] and to establish there his court was a sign of the ambition of the Visconti to extend their dominions to the area of the ancient Lombard Kingdom.\n\nIn the 1370s, Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II emerged without severe consequences from manifold simultaneous attacks. The two brothers were deprived by the emperor of their vicariate and condemned by the Pope Gregory XI as heretics. They subsequently suffered military incursions from the eastern border (by the count of Savoy) and from Bologna (by Papal-Florentine forces), which ended without significant impacts. A peace with the pope and a reconciliation with the count of Savoy  followed, while [[Florence]] turned against the pope in a [[War of the Eight Saints|new war]].<ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=8\u20139}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=52\u201354}}</ref> The years of Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II were marked also by the extension of their matrimonial policies.

The Turks were militarily defeated but were able to negotiate the [[Peace of Vasv\u00e1r]], which was highly favorable to them.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/01900/01911/html/index8.html Cross and Crescent]</ref>\n\n==Preparations==\nOttoman dominance in Hungary began with the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, which resulted in the conquest of most of Hungary by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. Meanwhile, the parts of Hungary that remained under Austrian control became known as [[Royal Hungary]]. Although the Ottomans had been in relative decline since the death of Suleiman I, Ottoman power saw a resurgence under the extremely capable [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family]] who sought to destroy the Austrian Habsburgs once and for all. They found their ''[[casus belli]]'' when the Habsburgs supported a Transylvanian rebellion against Ottoman rule.\n\n[[Transylvania]] had escaped Ottoman conquest during the invasion of Hungary and retained its independence by playing off of their powerful neighbors: [[Poland]], Austria and the Ottomans. They recognized Ottoman suzerainty and paid a tribute to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] but were given political and religious autonomy in return. In 1658, seeking new land for his principality, Prince [[George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|George R\u00e1k\u00f3czy II]] invaded Poland with his [[Sweden|Swedish]] allies in the [[Northern Wars|Second Northern War]]. After initial success, he was defeated by the Poles and fled back to Transylvania. On hearing about R\u00e1k\u00f3czy's unauthorized war, the Ottomans declared war on their vassal. It was not long before [[Grand Vizier]] [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha]] (Vizier 1656-1661) defeated R\u00e1k\u00f3czy and conquered Transylvania. The new Transylvanian prince, [[John Kem\u00e9ny (Prince)|J\u00e1nos Kem\u00e9ny]], fled to Vienna, seeking Austrian support.\n\nEmperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], not wishing to see Transylvania fall under direct Ottoman control, sent Montecuccoli into Hungary with his small army. Montecuccoli gave no direct support as he was severely outnumbered by the Ottomans. The Ottomans, meanwhile, completed the conquest of Transylvania {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} and built up their forces in Ottoman Hungary. Leopold I, not wishing to face the Turks alone, summoned the [[Diet (assembly)|Imperial Diet]] in January 1663.\n\nThe Turks failed to conquer the fortress of [[Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky]] six times, but managed to do so in 1663. It was made the center of an Ottoman province, the [[Uyvar eyalet]] in present-day southern [[Slovakia]]. Turks and Tatars crossed the Danube in strength in 1663, ravaging Slovakia, [[Moravia]], and [[Silesia]]. They took 12,000 slaves in Moravia. Several Turkish divisions reached as far as [[Olomouc]].<ref>[http://www.olomouc-tourism.cz/index.php?lang=2&kategorie=158&clanek=42 Olomouc History]</ref>\n\n[[Image:VasCounty.gif|thumb|left|Vas County - Hungary]]\n\n==Diplomatic efforts==\nAlthough Leopold personally objected to [[Protestantism]], he had to rely on his Protestant German princes to provide military aid. Even worse was the military aid from [[France]], which was (and continued to be until the [[Diplomatic Revolution]] of 1756) Austria's nemesis. Despite numerous objections from some Protestant princes, help was not withheld. The [[League of the Rhine]] - a French dominated group of German princes - agreed to send a corps of 6,000 men independently commanded by Count Coligny of France and Prince [[Johann Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn|Johann Philipp of Mainz]]. By September 1663, [[Brandenburg]] and [[Saxony]] had also agreed to contingents of their own. In January 1664, the Imperial Diet agreed to raise 21,000 men, although this army did not yet exist other than on paper. The Turks had declared war in April 1663, but were slow in executing their invasion plans.\n\n==Battle==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nK\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc's army, which might have numbered 120-150,000, probably included some 60,000 [[Janissary|Janissaries]] and [[sipahi]]s, 60-90,000 [[azap]]s, [[ak\u0131nc\u0131]]s, [[silidar]]s, [[Tatars]] and [[vassal]]s and allegedly 360 guns.\n\n[[Image:Raimondo-montecuccoli.jpg|thumb|left|Raimondo Montecuccoli]]\n\nMontecuccoli's army consisted of Habsburg forces (including [[Czechs|Czech]] infantry and a few hundred Hungarians, approx. 2,000 Croatians) and forces from the German principalities, French brigades,  a [[Piedmont]]ese regiment .\n\n'''The Habsburg forces:''' 5,000 infantry (10 Battalions), 5,900 cavalry (27 escadrons), 10 guns<br />\n'''The Imperial forces:''' 6,200 infantry (6 Battalions), 1,200 cavalry (9 escadrons), 14 guns<br />\n'''The Rhine forces:''' 600 infantry (2 Battalions), 300 cavalry (4 escadrons)<br />\n'''The French forces:''' 3,500 infantry (4 Battalions), 1,750 cavalry (10 escadrons)<br />\n'''Other forces:''' 2,000 Croat cavalry (out of this a regiment), Hungarian foot soldiers in [[Szentgotth\u00e1rd]], and Esterh\u00e1zy, Batthy\u00e1ny and N\u00e1dasdy regiment's, Czech [[musketeer]]s and the Italian (Piedmontish) infantry regiment (commander [[Francesco Pio de Savoya|Marchese Pio de Savoya]]).\n\nThe Turks renewed their invasion in the spring of 1664. They [[Siege of Novi Zrin (1664)|besieged, conquered and destroyed]] [[Novi Zrin|Novi Zrin Fortress]] on the [[Mur River|Mura]] river in [[northern Croatia]] at the very beginning of July. Montecuccoli was still waiting for help to arrive, and this delay was key to the defense of Austria. In July 1664 the Imperial forces were assembled and set out for the River [[R\u00e1ba]], which separated the Ottoman forces from the Austrian duchy itself. If the Turks were allowed to cross, they would threaten both Vienna and [[Graz]]. Montecuccoli intercepted the Turks before they crossed the river but the division of command made effective deployment of troops impossible.\n\nOn 1 August 1664, Ottoman forces crossed the river near the monastery of [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Saint Gotthar]]d and beat the Austrians back. Although initially plagued by disunity, Montecuccoli was finally able to convince Coligny and Leopold Wilhelm of Baden-Baden (commander of the Imperial detachment) to mass their forces and attack the Ottoman troops, who were reorganizing in a nearby forest. The attack surprised the Turks, who fled in confusion back to the river, a large number drowning. The confusion caused by the fleeing troops prevented Ahmed K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc (Vizier 1661-1676) from sending the rest of his army across the river and he instead retired from the field.\n\n[[File:A szentgotth\u00e1rdi csata (n\u00e9met k\u00e9p).jpg|thumb|250px|The Battle in an engraving of the era.]]\n\nOttoman casualties were heavy, significantly falling mostly on the elite corps of the army. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was left with an army of ill-trained irregulars and auxiliaries while Montecuccoli's casualties were light and mostly in the Imperial contingent.\n\n[[Image:Schl\u00f6sslbergi k\u0151kereszt.jpg|thumb|right|Stonecross of Sch\u00f6sslberg, over Mogersdorf; monument of the Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664).]]\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nAlthough many in Europe, especially the [[Croats]] and [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] nobility, expected the Austrian Habsburgs to finally liberate Hungary once and for all, Leopold abandoned the campaign. Many have criticized him for this decision (both in the past and the present). Although Montecuccoli's army was largely intact, there was no interest among the allies to liberate Hungary. Any invasion of Hungary would undoubtedly have to be done without the help of the French and German troops. Leopold noticed that the French officers had begun to fraternize with the Magyar nobles and encouraged them to rebel against Austrian rule.\n\nIn addition, Leopold had always been a member of the \"Spanish faction\" in Vienna. With the last [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]], [[Charles II of Spain|Carlos II]], about to die at any given moment, Leopold wanted to ensure that his hands were free for the inevitable struggle against [[Louis XIV of France]]. Although the liberation of Hungary was a strategic interest of the Habsburgs, it would have to wait until later. Throughout his reign, Leopold had always been more interested in the struggle against France rather than the Ottomans. Therefore, he signed the rather unfavourable [[Peace of Vasv\u00e1r]], which did not take into account the Battle of Saint Gotthard. The Battle of Saint Gotthard is still significant, however, for it stopped any Ottoman invasion of Austria, which certainly would have prolonged the war and led to a disastrous resolution. The Austrians would also use the twenty-year truce to build up their forces and begin the liberation of Hungary in 1683.\n\n==In literature==\nThe battle of Mogersdorf/Szentgotth\u00e1rd provided [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] with the inspiration for his poetic short story, \"[[:de:Die Weise von Liebe und Tod des Cornets Christoph Rilke|Lay of the Love and Death of Cornet Christopher Rilke]]\", which was very popular among German and Austrian soldiers during the first half of the 20th century.\n\n== Evliya \u00c7elebi and bullet extraction from the intracranial cavity via \u201c[[Trepanning|trephination]]\u201d ==\nIn the 7th volume of his ''Seyahatname'', the Turkish traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi|Evliy\u00e2 \u00c7elebi]] recounts the journey of Austria in the year 1665 in a long chapter. According to his anectodal travelogue, Evliy\u00e2 \u00c7elebi visited the Hospital of [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|Saint Stephan's Cathedral]] on the banks of the [[Danube]] in the city of [[Vienna]] as a member of an Ottoman embassy in 1665, after the [[Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664)|Battle of Saint Gotthard]] between an Ottoman army under the command of [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fczade Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha|K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed]] and an Habsburg army led by [[Raimondo Montecuccoli]], Jean de Coligny-Saligny, Wolfgang Julius von Hohenlohe, Prince Leopold of Baden, and Georg Friedrich of Waldeck on the [[R\u00e1ba|river Raab]] on August 1, 1664 <ref>{{Cite journal|last=K\u00f6kmen|first=E.|date=1972|title=A fantastic craniotomy: excerpt from the 17th century Turkish travelogue of Evliy\u00e2 Celebi.

The Turks were militarily defeated but were able to negotiate the [[Peace of Vasv\u00e1r]], which was highly favorable to them.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/01900/01911/html/index8.html Cross and Crescent]</ref>\n\n==Preparations==\nOttoman dominance in Hungary began with the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, which resulted in the conquest of most of Hungary by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. Meanwhile, the parts of Hungary that remained under Austrian control became known as [[Royal Hungary]]. Although the Ottomans had been in relative decline since the death of Suleiman I, Ottoman power saw a resurgence under the extremely capable [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family]] who sought to destroy the Austrian Habsburgs once and for all. They found their ''[[casus belli]]'' when the Habsburgs supported a Transylvanian rebellion against Ottoman rule.\n\n[[Transylvania]] had escaped Ottoman conquest during the invasion of Hungary and retained its independence by playing off of their powerful neighbors: [[Poland]], Austria and the Ottomans. They recognized Ottoman suzerainty and paid a tribute to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] but were given political and religious autonomy in return. In 1658, seeking new land for his principality, Prince [[George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|George R\u00e1k\u00f3czy II]] invaded Poland with his [[Sweden|Swedish]] allies in the [[Northern Wars|Second Northern War]]. After initial success, he was defeated by the Poles and fled back to Transylvania. On hearing about R\u00e1k\u00f3czy's unauthorized war, the Ottomans declared war on their vassal. It was not long before [[Grand Vizier]] [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha]] (Vizier 1656-1661) defeated R\u00e1k\u00f3czy and conquered Transylvania. The new Transylvanian prince, [[John Kem\u00e9ny (Prince)|J\u00e1nos Kem\u00e9ny]], fled to Vienna, seeking Austrian support.\n\nEmperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], not wishing to see Transylvania fall under direct Ottoman control, sent Montecuccoli into Hungary with his small army. Montecuccoli gave no direct support as he was severely outnumbered by the Ottomans. The Ottomans, meanwhile, completed the conquest of Transylvania {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} and built up their forces in Ottoman Hungary. Leopold I, not wishing to face the Turks alone, summoned the [[Diet (assembly)|Imperial Diet]] in January 1663.\n\nThe Turks failed to conquer the fortress of [[Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky]] six times, but managed to do so in 1663. It was made the center of an Ottoman province, the [[Uyvar eyalet]] in present-day southern [[Slovakia]]. Turks and Tatars crossed the Danube in strength in 1663, ravaging Slovakia, [[Moravia]], and [[Silesia]]. They took 12,000 slaves in Moravia. Several Turkish divisions reached as far as [[Olomouc]].<ref>[http://www.olomouc-tourism.cz/index.php?lang=2&kategorie=158&clanek=42 Olomouc History]</ref>\n\n[[Image:VasCounty.gif|thumb|left|Vas County - Hungary]]\n\n==Diplomatic efforts==\nAlthough Leopold personally objected to [[Protestantism]], he had to rely on his Protestant German princes to provide military aid. Even worse was the military aid from [[France]], which was (and continued to be until the [[Diplomatic Revolution]] of 1756) Austria's nemesis. Despite numerous objections from some Protestant princes, help was not withheld. The [[League of the Rhine]] - a French dominated group of German princes - agreed to send a corps of 6,000 men independently commanded by Count Coligny of France and Prince [[Johann Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn|Johann Philipp of Mainz]]. By September 1663, [[Brandenburg]] and [[Saxony]] had also agreed to contingents of their own. In January 1664, the Imperial Diet agreed to raise 21,000 men, although this army did not yet exist other than on paper. The Turks had declared war in April 1663, but were slow in executing their invasion plans.\n\n==Battle==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nK\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc's army, which might have numbered 120-150,000, probably included some 60,000 [[Janissary|Janissaries]] and [[sipahi]]s, 60-90,000 [[azap]]s, [[ak\u0131nc\u0131]]s, [[silidar]]s, [[Tatars]] and [[vassal]]s and allegedly 360 guns.\n\n[[Image:Raimondo-montecuccoli.jpg|thumb|left|Raimondo Montecuccoli]]\n\nMontecuccoli's army consisted of Habsburg forces (including [[Czechs|Czech]] infantry and a few hundred Hungarians, approx. 2,000 Croatians) and forces from the German principalities, French brigades,  a [[Piedmont]]ese regiment .\n\n'''The Habsburg forces:''' 5,000 infantry (10 Battalions), 5,900 cavalry (27 escadrons), 10 guns<br />\n'''The Imperial forces:''' 6,200 infantry (6 Battalions), 1,200 cavalry (9 escadrons), 14 guns<br />\n'''The Rhine forces:''' 600 infantry (2 Battalions), 300 cavalry (4 escadrons)<br />\n'''The French forces:''' 3,500 infantry (4 Battalions), 1,750 cavalry (10 escadrons)<br />\n'''Other forces:''' 2,000 Croat cavalry (out of this a regiment), Hungarian foot soldiers in [[Szentgotth\u00e1rd]], and Esterh\u00e1zy, Batthy\u00e1ny and N\u00e1dasdy regiment's, Czech [[musketeer]]s and the Italian (Piedmontish) infantry regiment (commander [[Francesco Pio de Savoya|Marchese Pio de Savoya]]).\n\nThe Turks renewed their invasion in the spring of 1664. They [[Siege of Novi Zrin (1664)|besieged, conquered and destroyed]] [[Novi Zrin|Novi Zrin Fortress]] on the [[Mur River|Mura]] river in [[northern Croatia]] at the very beginning of July. Montecuccoli was still waiting for help to arrive, and this delay was key to the defense of Austria. In July 1664 the Imperial forces were assembled and set out for the River [[R\u00e1ba]], which separated the Ottoman forces from the Austrian duchy itself. If the Turks were allowed to cross, they would threaten both Vienna and [[Graz]]. Montecuccoli intercepted the Turks before they crossed the river but the division of command made effective deployment of troops impossible.\n\nOn 1 August 1664, Ottoman forces crossed the river near the monastery of [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Saint Gotthar]]d and beat the Austrians back. Although initially plagued by disunity, Montecuccoli was finally able to convince Coligny and Leopold Wilhelm of Baden-Baden (commander of the Imperial detachment) to mass their forces and attack the Ottoman troops, who were reorganizing in a nearby forest. The attack surprised the Turks, who fled in confusion back to the river, a large number drowning. The confusion caused by the fleeing troops prevented Ahmed K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc (Vizier 1661-1676) from sending the rest of his army across the river and he instead retired from the field.\n\n[[File:A szentgotth\u00e1rdi csata (n\u00e9met k\u00e9p).jpg|thumb|250px|The Battle in an engraving of the era.]]\n\nOttoman casualties were heavy, significantly falling mostly on the elite corps of the army. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was left with an army of ill-trained irregulars and auxiliaries while Montecuccoli's casualties were light and mostly in the Imperial contingent.\n\n[[Image:Schl\u00f6sslbergi k\u0151kereszt.jpg|thumb|right|Stonecross of Sch\u00f6sslberg, over Mogersdorf; monument of the Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664).]]\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nAlthough many in Europe, especially the [[Croats]] and [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] nobility, expected the Austrian Habsburgs to finally liberate Hungary once and for all, Leopold abandoned the campaign. Many have criticized him for this decision (both in the past and the present). Although Montecuccoli's army was largely intact, there was no interest among the allies to liberate Hungary. Any invasion of Hungary would undoubtedly have to be done without the help of the French and German troops. Leopold noticed that the French officers had begun to fraternize with the Magyar nobles and encouraged them to rebel against Austrian rule.\n\nIn addition, Leopold had always been a member of the \"Spanish faction\" in Vienna. With the last [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]], [[Charles II of Spain|Carlos II]], about to die at any given moment, Leopold wanted to ensure that his hands were free for the inevitable struggle against [[Louis XIV of France]]. Although the liberation of Hungary was a strategic interest of the Habsburgs, it would have to wait until later. Throughout his reign, Leopold had always been more interested in the struggle against France rather than the Ottomans. Therefore, he signed the rather unfavourable [[Peace of Vasv\u00e1r]], which did not take into account the Battle of Saint Gotthard. The Battle of Saint Gotthard is still significant, however, for it stopped any Ottoman invasion of Austria, which certainly would have prolonged the war and led to a disastrous resolution. The Austrians would also use the twenty-year truce to build up their forces and begin the liberation of Hungary in 1683.\n\n==In literature==\nThe battle of Mogersdorf/Szentgotth\u00e1rd provided [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] with the inspiration for his poetic short story, \"[[:de:Die Weise von Liebe und Tod des Cornets Christoph Rilke|Lay of the Love and Death of Cornet Christopher Rilke]]\", which was very popular among German and Austrian soldiers during the first half of the 20th century.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|War}}\n* [[Battle of Saint Gotthard (1705)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons and category|Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664)|Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664)}}\n* {{Cite ADB|35|264|267|Sporck, Johann Graf von|Felix Stieve|ADB:Sporck, Johann Graf von|ref=CITEREF1893Stieve}}\n* Jeremy Black & Rhoads Murphey, ''Ottoman Warfare, 1500-1700'', Routledge, 1999.\n* Peter H.

{"title_page": "Internet Protocol television", "text_new": "{{redirect|IPTV|Iowa Public Television|Iowa PBS}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2012}}\n\n[[File:Mview IPTV.jpg|thumb|M VIEW IPTV device]]\n\n'''Internet Protocol television''' ('''IPTV''') is the delivery of [[television]] content over [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) networks. This is in contrast to delivery through traditional [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]], [[Satellite television|satellite]], and [[Cable television|cable]] television formats. Unlike [[download]]ed media, IPTV offers the ability to stream the source media continuously. As a result, a client media player can begin playing the content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately. This is known as [[streaming media]].\n\nAlthough IPTV uses the Internet protocol it is not limited to [[streaming television|television streamed]] from the [[Internet]] ([[Internet television]]). IPTV is widely deployed in subscriber-based telecommunications networks with high-speed access channels into end-user premises via [[set-top box]]es or other [[customer-premises equipment]]. IPTV is also used for media delivery around corporate and private networks. IPTV in the telecommunications arena is notable for its ongoing standardisation process (e.g., [[ETSI|European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]).\n\nIPTV services may be classified into [[live television]] and live media, with or without related interactivity; [[time shifting]] of media, e.g., [[catch-up TV]] (replays a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago), start-over TV (replays the current TV show from its beginning); and [[video on demand]] (VOD) which involves browsing and viewing items of a media catalogue.\n\n==Definition==\nHistorically, many different definitions of IPTV have appeared, including elementary streams{{clarify|date=February 2018}} over IP networks, [[MPEG transport stream]]s over IP networks and a number of proprietary systems. One official definition approved by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] focus group on IPTV (ITU-T FG IPTV) is:\n\n<blockquote>IPTV is defined as multimedia services such as television/video/audio/text/graphics/data delivered over IP based networks managed to provide the required level of quality of service and experience, security, interactivity and reliability.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/IPTV+Standardization+On+Track+Say+Industry+Experts.aspx |work=ITU-T Newslog |date=27 October 2006 |title=IPTV Standardization on Track Say Industry Experts |access-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916031736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/IPTV+Standardization+On+Track+Say+Industry+Experts.aspx |archive-date=16 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother definition of IPTV, relating to the telecommunications industry, is the one given by [[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions]] (ATIS) IPTV Exploratory Group in 2005:\n\n<blockquote>IPTV is defined as the secure and reliable delivery to subscribers of entertainment video and related services.  These services may include, for example, Live TV, Video On Demand (VOD) and [[Interactive television|Interactive TV (iTV)]]. These services are delivered across an access agnostic, packet switched network that employs the IP protocol to transport the audio, video and control signals. In contrast to video over the public Internet, with IPTV deployments, network security and performance are tightly managed to ensure a superior entertainment experience, resulting in a compelling business environment for content providers, advertisers and customers alike.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.atis.org/tops/IEG/ATIS_IPTV_EG_RPT_final.pdf |access-date=17 January 2012 |title=ATIS IPTV Exploratory Group Report and Recommendation to the TOPS Council |date=July 2006 |publisher=Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118031705/http://www.atis.org/tops/IEG/ATIS_IPTV_EG_RPT_final.pdf |archive-date=18 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nUp until the early 1990s, it was not thought possible that a [[television show|television programme]] could be squeezed into the limited [[telecommunication]] [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a [[copper]] [[telephone cable]] to provide a [[video-on-demand]] (VOD) television service of acceptable quality, as the required bandwidth of a [[digital television]] signal was around 200{{nbsp}}[[Mbps]], which was 2,000 times greater than the bandwidth of a speech signal over a copper [[telephone wire]]. VOD services were only made possible as a result of two major technological developments: [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) [[video compression]] and [[asymmetric digital subscriber line]] (ADSL) [[data transmission]].<ref name=\"Lea\">{{cite book |last1=Lea |first1=William |title=Video on demand: Research Paper 94/68 |date=1994 |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |location=9 May 1994 |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP94-68 |accessdate=20 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082623/https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP94-68 |archive-date=20 September 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> DCT is a [[lossy compression]] technique that was first proposed by [[N.

The combination of DCT and ADSL technologies made it possible to practically implement VOD services at around 2{{nbsp}}Mbps bandwidth in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Lea\"/>\n\nThe term IPTV first appeared in 1995 with the founding of [[Precept Software]] by [[Judith Estrin]]  and [[William N. Carrico Jr.|Bill Carrico]]. Precept developed an Internet video product named ''IP/TV''.

Examples of types of commercial users include airports, schools, offices, hotels, and sports stadiums, to name just a few.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:IPTVnet.png|thumbnail|A simplified network diagram for IPTV]]\n\n===Elements===\n{{prose|section|date=April 2020}}\n* IPTV head-end: where live TV channels and AV sources are encoded, encrypted and delivered in the form of [[IP multicast]] streams.\n* Video on Demand (VOD) platform: where on-demand video assets are stored and served as IP unicast streams when a user makes a request. The VOD platform may sometimes be located with, and considered part of, the IPTV headend.\n* Interactive portal: allows the user to navigate within the different IPTV services, such as the VOD catalogue.\n* Delivery network: the packet-switched network that carries IP packets (unicast and multicast).\n* Endpoints: User equipment that can request, decode and deliver IPTV streams for display to the user. This can include computers and mobile devices as well as [[set-top box]]es.\n* Home [[TV gateway]]: the piece of equipment at a residential IPTV user's home that terminates the access link from the delivery network.\n* User [[set-top box]]: the piece of endpoint equipment that decodes and decrypts TV and VOD streams for display on the TV screen.\n\n===Architecture of a video server network===\nDepending on the network architecture of the service provider, there are two main types of video server architecture that can be considered for IPTV deployment: centralised and distributed.\n\nThe centralised architecture model is a relatively simple and easy to manage solution. Because all media content is stored in centralised servers, it does not require a comprehensive content distribution system. Centralised architecture is generally good for a network that provides relatively small VOD service deployment, has adequate core and edge bandwidth or has an efficient [[content delivery network]] (CDN).\n\nA distributed architecture has bandwidth usage advantages and inherent system management features that are essential for managing a larger server network.

Playback requires a broadband device connected to either a fixed or wireless IP network in the form of either a standalone [[personal computer]] or limited embedded [[Operating system|OS]] device such as a [[smartphone]], [[Internet tablet|touch screen tablet]], [[game console]], [[connected TV]] or [[Set-top box#IPTV receiver|set-top box]].  Video compression is provided by either a [[H.263]] or [[H.264]] derived codec, audio is compressed via a [[MDCT]] based codec and then encapsulated in either an [[MPEG transport stream]] or [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]] packets or [[Flash Video]] packets for live or VoD streaming.  IP multicasting allows for live data to be sent to multiple receivers using a single multicast group address. [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]]/MPEG-4 AVC is commonly used for internet streaming over higher bit rate standards such as [[H.261]] and [[H.263]] which were more designed for [[ISDN]] video conferencing. [[H.262]]/MPEG-1/2 is generally not used as the bandwidth required would quite easily saturate a network which is why they are only used in single link broadcast or storage applications.\n\nIn standards-based IPTV systems, the primary underlying protocols used are:\n* Service provider-based streaming:\n** [[IGMP]] for subscribing to a live multicast stream (TV channel) and for changing from one live multicast stream to another (TV channel change). IP multicast operates within LANs (including VLANs) and across WANs also. IP multicast is usually routed in the network core by [[Protocol Independent Multicast]] (PIM), setting up correct distribution of multicast streams (TV channels) from their source all the way to the customers who wants to view them, duplicating received packets as needed.  On-demand content uses a negotiated unicast connection. [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) over [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) or the lower overhead [[H.222]] transport stream over [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) are generally the preferred methods of encapsulation.\n* [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based [[unicast]] only live and VoD streaming:\n** [[Adobe Flash Player]] prefers [[Real Time Messaging Protocol|RTMP]] over TCP with setup and control via either [[Action Message Format|AMF]] or [[XML]] or [[JSON]] transactions.\n** Apple iOS uses [[HTTP Live Streaming|HLS]] [[adaptive bitrate streaming]] over [[HTTP]] with setup and control via an embedded [[M3U]] playlist file.\n** Microsoft Silverlight uses [[Smooth Streaming|smooth streaming]] ([[adaptive bitrate streaming]]) over HTTP.\n* Web-based multicast live and unicast VoD streaming:\n** The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) recommends RTP over UDP or [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] transports with setup and control using [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]] over TCP.\n* [[Connected TV]]s, [[game console]]s, [[Set-top box#IPTV receiver|set-top boxes]] and [[network personal video recorder]]s:\n** local network content uses [[Universal Plug and Play#UPnP AV standards|UPnP AV]] for [[unicast]] via HTTP over TCP or for multicast live RTP over UDP.\n** Web-based content is provided through either inline Web plug-ins or a television broadcast-based application that uses a [[middleware]] language such as [[MHEG-5]] that triggers an event such as loading an inline Web browser using an [[Adobe Flash Player]] plug-in.\n\nA telecommunications company IPTV service is usually delivered over an investment-heavy [[Walled garden (technology)|walled garden network]].\n\nLocal IPTV, as used by businesses for [[audio visual]] AV distribution on their company networks is typically based on a mixture of:\n# Conventional TV reception equipment and IPTV encoders\n# IP[[TV gateway]]s that take broadcast MPEG channels and IP wrap them to create multicast streams.\n\n==Via satellite==\nAlthough IPTV and conventional [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] distribution have been seen as complementary technologies, they are likely to be increasingly used together in hybrid IPTV networks that deliver the highest levels of performance and reliability. IPTV is largely neutral to the transmission medium, and IP traffic is already routinely carried by satellite for [[Internet backbone]] trunking and corporate [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] networks.<ref>Berlocher, Greg and Freyer, Dan. \"IP And Satellite: Communications Worlds Merging\" ''Via Satellite'' January 2009 p 24\u201328</ref> The use of satellite to carry IP is fundamental to overcoming the greatest shortcoming of IPTV over terrestrial cables \u2013 the speed/bandwidth of the connection, as well as availability.\n\nThe copper twisted pair cabling that forms the [[last mile]] of the telephone and broadband network in many countries is not able to provide a sizeable proportion of the population with an IPTV service that matches even existing terrestrial or satellite digital TV distribution. For a competitive multi-channel TV service, a connection speed of 20&nbsp;Mbit/s is likely to be required, but unavailable to most potential customers.<ref>Taga, Karim. \"Hybrid delivery of content for IPTV\" ''InterComms'' Issue 11 August 2008 p 13\u201314</ref> The increasing popularity of [[high-definition television]] (with twice the data rate of [[Standard-definition television|SD video]]) increases connection speed requirements, or limits IPTV service quality and connection eligibility even further.\n\nHowever, satellites are capable of delivering in excess of 100&nbsp;Gbit/s via multi-spot beam technologies, making satellite a clear emerging technology for implementing IPTV networks. Satellite distribution can be included in an IPTV network architecture in several ways. The simplest to implement is an IPTV-[[Direct-broadcast satellite|direct to home]] (DTH) architecture, in which hybrid DVB-broadband [[set-top box]]es in subscriber homes integrate satellite and IP reception to give near-infinite bandwidth with return channel capabilities. In such a system, many live TV channels may be multicast via satellite (IP-encapsulated or as conventional [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] digital TV) with stored video-on-demand transmission via the broadband connection.

Since the emergence of online video aggregation sites, like [[YouTube]] and [[Vimeo]] in the mid-2000s, traditional [[pay TV]] operators have come under increasing pressure to provide their subscribers with a means of viewing [[Internet]]-based video [both professional and user-generated] on their televisions. At the same time, specialist [[Internet Protocol|IP]]-based operators [often telecommunications providers] have looked for ways to offer [[Analog television|analogue]] and [[digital terrestrial]] services to their operations, without adding either additional cost or complexity to their transmission operations. [[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]] is a valuable asset for operators, so many have looked for alternative ways to deliver these new services without investing in additional network infrastructures.\n\nA hybrid set-top allows content from a range of sources, including [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] broadcast, satellite, and cable, to be brought together with video delivered over the Internet via an Ethernet connection on the device. This enables television viewers to access a greater variety of content on their TV sets, without the need for a separate box for each service.\n\nHybrid IPTV set-top boxes also enable users to access a range of advanced interactive services, such as [[Video on demand|VOD]] / catch-up TV, as well as Internet applications, including [[Videotelephony|video telephony]], surveillance, gaming, shopping, [[E-Government|e-government]] accessed via a [[television set]].\n\nFrom a [[pay-TV]] operator's perspective, a hybrid IPTV set-top box gives them greater long-term flexibility by enabling them to deploy new services and applications as and when consumers require, most often without the need to upgrade equipment or for a technician to visit and reconfigure or swap out the device. This reduces the cost of launching new services, increases speed to market and limits disruption for consumers.<ref>[http://www.v-net.tv/Webcast.aspx?id=5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405064453/http://www.v-net.tv/Webcast.aspx?id=5 |date=5 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] (HbbTV) consortium of industry companies is currently{{When|date=January 2012}} promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast and broadband digital TV and multimedia applications with a single user interface.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=HbbTV Consortium |date=27 August 2009 |url=http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |title=New European initiative merges television with the power of the Internet |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007125549/http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |archive-date=7 October 2009 }}</ref> These trends led to the development of [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] set-top boxes that included both a [[ATSC tuner|broadcast tuner]] and an [[Internet access|Internet connection]]&nbsp;\u2013 usually an [[Ethernet]] port.

The platform was developed for Spanish pay TV operator [[Telefonica]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltvnews.net/items/060911adb_spain.htm |title=ADB Delivers World's First Hybrid, Single-Chip, Advanced Video Coding, High Definition IPTV Set-Top Boxes To TELEF\u00d3NICA |publisher=Digitaltvnews.net |date= |access-date=15 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227141252/http://www.digitaltvnews.net/items/060911adb_spain.htm |archive-date=27 February 2012 }}</ref> and used as part of its Movistar TV service, launched to subscribers at the end of 2005.\n\nAn alternative approach is the IPTV version of the [[Headend in the Sky]] cable TV solution. Here, multiple TV channels are distributed via satellite to the ISP or IPTV provider's [[point of presence]] (POP) for IP-encapsulated distribution to individual subscribers as required by each subscriber.\n\nThis can provide a huge selection of channels to subscribers without overburdening Internet trunking to the POP, and enables an IPTV service to be offered to small or remote operators outside the reach of terrestrial high speed broadband connection. An example is a network combining fibre and satellite distribution via an [[SES New Skies]] satellite of 95 channels to Latin America and the Caribbean, operated by IPTV Americas.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=IPTV Americas |date=13 January 2009 |url=http://www.iptv-americas.tv/releaseDB.php?leng=&notID=47 |title=IPTV Americas Launches First IPTV Satellite Distribution Platform for Latin America and The Caribbean via SES NEW SKIES' NSS-806 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016015125/http://www.iptv-americas.tv/releaseDB.php?leng=&notID=47 |archive-date=16 October 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nWhile the future development of IPTV probably lies with a number of coexisting architectures and implementations, it is clear{{According to whom|date=January 2012}} that broadcasting of high bandwidth applications such as IPTV is accomplished more efficiently and cost-effectively using satellite<ref>International Datacasting Corporation [http://www.datacast.com/pg_SolutionIndex.php \"Why IP Over Satellite?\"].

Retrieved 18 January 2009.</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nThe Internet protocol-based platform offers significant advantages, including the ability to integrate television with other IP-based services like high speed Internet access and VoIP.\n\nA switched IP network also allows for the delivery of significantly more content and functionality. In a typical TV or satellite network, using broadcast video technology, all the content constantly flows downstream to each customer, and the customer switches the content at the set-top box. The customer can select from as many choices as the telecomms, cable or satellite company can stuff into the \"pipe\" flowing into the home. A switched IP network works differently. Content remains in the network, and only the content the customer selects is sent into the customer's home. That frees up bandwidth, and the customer's choice is less restricted by the size of the \"pipe\" into the home. This also implies that the customer's privacy could be compromised to a greater extent than is possible with traditional TV or satellite networks. It may also provide a means to hack into, or at least disrupt (see [[Denial-of-service attack|Denial of service]]) the private network.\n\n===Economics===\nThe cable industry's expenditures of approximately $1 billion per year are based on network updates to accommodate higher data speeds. Most operators use 2\u20133 channels to support maximum data speeds of 50&nbsp;Mbit/s to 100&nbsp;Mbit/s. However, because video streams require a high bit rate for much longer periods of time, the expenditures to support high amounts of video traffic will be much greater. This phenomenon is called persistency. Data persistency is routinely 5% while video persistency can easily reach 50%. As video traffic continues to grow, this means that significantly more [[Cable modem termination system|CMTS]] downstream channels will be required to carry this video content. Based on today's market, it is likely that industry expenditures for CMTS expansion could exceed $2 billion a year, virtually all of that expenditure being driven by video traffic. Adoption of IPTV for carrying the majority of this traffic could save the industry approximately 75% of this capital expenditure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.curvedview.com/economics-iptv/|title=The Economics of IPTV|date=2 February 2015|language=en-US|access-date=23 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920030343/http://www.curvedview.com/economics-iptv/|archive-date=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nAnd https://worldiptvlinks.com/\n===Interactivity===\nAn IP-based platform also allows significant opportunities to make the TV viewing experience more interactive and personalised.\nThe supplier may, for example, include an interactive programme guide that allows viewers to search for content by title or actor's name, or a [[picture-in-picture]] functionality that allows them to \"channel surf\" without leaving the programme they're watching. Viewers may be able to look up a player's stats while watching a sports game, or control the camera angle. They also may be able to access photos or music from their PC on their television, use a wireless phone to schedule a recording of their favourite show, or even adjust parental controls so their child can watch a documentary for a school report, while they're away from home.\n\nIn order that there can take place an interaction between the receiver and the transmitter, a feedback channel is needed. Due to this, terrestrial, satellite, and cable networks for television do not allow interactivity. However, interactivity with those networks can be possible by combining TV networks with data networks such as the [[Internet]] or a mobile communication network.\n\n===Video-on-demand===\nIPTV technology is bringing [[video on demand]] (VoD) to television,<ref>[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ Broadband Users Control What They Watch and When] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420143608/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ |date=20 April 2010 }}</ref> which permits a customer to browse an online programme or film catalogue, to watch trailers and to then select a selected recording. The [[playout]] of the selected item starts nearly instantaneously on the customer's TV or PC.\n\nTechnically, when the customer selects the movie, a [[Point-to-Point Protocol|point-to-point]] unicast connection is set up between the customer's decoder (set-top box or PC) and the delivering streaming server. The signalling for the trick play functionality (pause, slow-motion, wind/rewind etc.) is assured by RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol).\n\nThe most common codecs used for VoD are [[MPEG-2]], [[MPEG-4]] and [[VC-1]].\n\nIn an attempt to avoid content piracy, the VoD content is usually encrypted. Whilst [[encryption]] of satellite and cable TV broadcasts is an old practice, with IPTV technology it can effectively be thought of as a form of [[Digital rights management]]. A film that is chosen, for example, may be playable for 24 hours following payment, after which time it becomes unavailable.\n\n===IPTV-based converged services===\nAnother advantage is the opportunity for integration and convergence. This opportunity is amplified when using IMS-based solutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Session and Media Signalling for IPTV via IMS|url=http://c-mobile.ptinovacao.pt/files/PaperMobilWare2008.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625075612/http://c-mobile.ptinovacao.pt/files/PaperMobilWare2008.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 June 2008|website=MobileWare'08|authors=Riede, Christian & Al-Hezmi, Adel & Magedanz, Thomas||location= Innsbruck, Austria||isbn=|date=12 February 2008 }}</ref> Converged services implies interaction of existing services in a seamless manner to create new value added services. One example is on-screen [[Caller ID]], getting Caller ID on a TV, and the ability to handle it (send it to voice mail, etc.). IP-based services help to enable efforts to provide consumers anytime-anywhere access to content over their televisions, PCs, and mobile device, and to integrate services and content to tie them together. Within businesses and institutions, IPTV eliminates the need to run a parallel infrastructure to deliver live and stored video services.\n\n==Limitations==\nIPTV is sensitive to packet loss and delays if the streamed data is unreliable. IPTV has strict minimum speed requirements in order to facilitate the right number of frames per second to deliver moving pictures. This means that the limited connection speed and bandwidth available for a large IPTV customer base can reduce the service quality delivered.\n\nAlthough a few countries have very high-speed broadband-enabled populations, such as [[South Korea]] with 6 million homes benefiting from a minimum connection speed of 100&nbsp;Mbit/s, in other countries (such as the UK) legacy networks struggle to provide 3\u20135&nbsp;Mbit/s<ref>Bulkley, Kate. \"IPTV\u2019s Eastern Promise\" ''Digital TV Europe'' October 2008 p 48</ref>{{Update after|2013|8|13}} and so simultaneous provision to the home of TV channels, VOIP and Internet access may not be viable. The last-mile delivery for IPTV usually has a bandwidth restriction that only allows a small number of simultaneous TV channel streams&nbsp;\u2013 typically from one to three&nbsp;\u2013 to be delivered.<ref>Brown, Peter J. \"Super Headends And High Expectations\" ''Via Satellite'' April 2006 p 18\u201330</ref>\n\nStreaming IPTV across wireless links within the home has proved troublesome; not due to bandwidth limitations as many{{Who|date=January 2012}} assume, but due to issues with multipath and reflections of the RF signal carrying the IP data packets.

Service providers such as AT&T (which makes extensive use of wireline home networking as part of its [[AT&T U-verse]] IPTV service) have expressed support for the work done in this direction by [[ITU-T]], which has adopted Recommendation [[G.hn]] (also known as G.9960), which is a next-generation home networking standard that specifies a common PHY/MAC that can operate over any home wiring (power lines, phone lines or coaxial cables).<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/homepna-homegrid-sign-liaison-agreement/story.aspx?guid={C8E4BB07-375A-41E5-8B05-2E33222E44C2}&dist=msr_9 HomePNA and HomeGrid Sign Liaison Agreement]{{dead link|date=February 2016}}, Groups Work to Promote New ITU G.hn Global Wired Home Networking Standard</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everywire.com/2009/02/att-participating-in-ghn-standard-development-1.html|title=AT&T Participating in G.hn Standard Development|author=|date=|website=everywire.com|access-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810051112/http://www.everywire.com/2009/02/att-participating-in-ghn-standard-development-1.html|archive-date=10 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Latency===\nThe [[latency (engineering)|latency]] inherent in the use of [[Satellite Internet access|satellite Internet]] is often held up as reason why satellites cannot be successfully used for IPTV. In practice, however, latency is not an important factor for IPTV, since it is a service that does not require real-time transmission, as is the case with telephony or videoconferencing services.\n\nIt is the latency of response to requests to change channel, display an EPG, etc. that most affects customers\u2019 perceived quality of service, and these problems affect satellite IPTV no more than terrestrial IPTV. Command latency problems, faced by terrestrial IPTV networks with insufficient bandwidth as their customer base grows, may be solved by the high capacity of satellite distribution.\n\nSatellite distribution does suffer from latency&nbsp;\u2013 the time for the signal to travel up from the hub to the satellite and back down to the user is around 0.25 seconds, and cannot be reduced. However, the effects of this delay are mitigated in real-life systems using data compression, TCP-acceleration, and HTTP pre-fetching.<ref>Newtec Productions NV [http://www.newtec.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/product_leaflets/sat3Play/Sat3Play_Ku-band_Terminal_TP210_R1.pdf \"TP210 Sat3Play Broadband Terminal\"] (Version R2/06.2010).

Existing [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] TV channels that [[simulcast]] by both terrestrial and satellite transmissions experience the same 0.25-second delay difference between the two services with no detrimental effect, and it goes unnoticed by viewers.\n\n==Bandwidth requirements==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Figure2a.jpg|thumb|400px|Bandwidth capacity for simultaneously two HDTV streams, two SD streams, additional to HSD and voice]]\n\nDigital video is a combination of sequence of digital images, and they are made up of [[pixel]]s or picture elements. Each pixel has two values, which are [[luminance]] and [[chrominance]]. Luminance is representing intensity of the pixel; chrominance represents the colour of the pixel. Three bytes would be used to represent the colour of the high quality image for a true colour technique. A sequence of images is creating the digital video, in that case, images are called as frames.\n\nMovies use 24 frames per second; however, the rate of the frames can change according to territories' electrical systems so that there are different kinds of frame rates, for instance, North America is using approximately 30 frames per second where the Europe television frame rate is 25 frames per second. Each digital video has dimensions width and height; when referred to analogue television, the dimension for SDTV is 720\u00d7480 pixels, on the other hand, numerous HDTV requires 1920\u00d71080 pixels. Moreover, whilst for SDTV, two bytes (16 bits) is enough to create the colour depth, HDTV requires three bytes (24 bits) to create the colour depth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThereby, with a rate of 30 frames/second, the uncompressed data rate for SDTV becomes 30\u00d7720\u00d7480\u00d716,{{vague|date=July 2017}} in other words, 147,456,000 bits per second. Moreover, for HDTV, at the same frame rate, uncompressed date rate becomes 30\u00d71920\u00d71080\u00d724 or 1,492,992,000 bits per second. Using that simple calculation, a service provider's service delivery to the subscribers is limited unless a lossy compression method is used.\n\nThere is no absolute answer for the bandwidth requirement for the IPTV service because the bandwidth requirement is increasing due to the devices inside the household. Thus, currently compressed HDTV content can be delivered at a data rate between 8 and 10&nbsp;Mbit/s, but if the home of the consumer equipped with several HDTV outputs, this rate will be multiplied respectively.\n\nThe high-speed data transfer will increase the needed bandwidth for the viewer, at least 2&nbsp;Mbit/s is needed to use web-based applications on the computer. Additionally to that, 64&nbsp;kbit/s is required to use landline telephone for the property. In minimal usage, to receive an IPTV triple-play service requires 13&nbsp;Mbit/s to process in a household.\n\n==Privacy implications==\nDue to limitations in bandwidth, an IPTV channel is delivered to the user one at a time, as opposed to the traditional multiplexed delivery. Changing a channel requires requesting the head-end server to provide a different broadcast stream, much like [[Video on demand|VOD]] (For VOD the stream is delivered using [[unicast]], for the normal TV signal multicast is used). This could enable the service provider to accurately track each and every programme watched and the duration of watching for each viewer; broadcasters and advertisers could then understand their audience and programming better with accurate data and [[targeted advertising]].\n\nIn conjunction with regulatory differences between IPTV and cable TV, this tracking could pose a threat to privacy according to critics.<ref>[http://www.cedmagazine.com/iptv-privacy-risks.aspx IPTV privacy risks<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105172921/http://www.cedmagazine.com/iptv-privacy-risks.aspx |date=5 January 2010 }}</ref>  For IP multicast scenarios, since a particular multicast group (TV channel) needs to be requested before it can be viewed, the same privacy concerns apply.\n\n==Vendors==\nGlobal sales of IPTV systems exceeded US$2 billion in 2007, although only a small number of companies supply most current IPTV system solutions. Some, such as [[Movistar TV]], were formed by telecoms operators themselves, to minimise external costs, a tactic also used by [[PCCW]] of [[Hong Kong]]. Some major telecoms vendors are also active in this space, notably [[Accenture]] (Accenture Video Solution), [[Alcatel-Lucent]] (sometimes working with Movistar TV), [[Ericsson]] (notably since acquiring [[Tandberg Television]]), [[Huawei]], [[NEC]], [[PTCL Smart TV]], [[Sri Lanka Telecom]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson]], and [[ZTE]], as are some IT houses, led by [[Microsoft]]. Delaware-based AlphaOTT Tokyo-based The New Media Group, Malaysian-based [[Select-TV]], Oslo/Norway-based SnapTV, and California-based [[UTStarcom]], Inc. also offer end-to-end networking infrastructure for IPTV-based services, and Hong Kong-based BNS Ltd. provides turnkey open platform IPTV technology solutions. \n\nChannel PEAR is a \"collaborative, cloud-based media platform\"<ref>{{cite web|website=Channel PEAR |title=Login|url=https://channelpear.com/login/}}</ref> that allows users to create a private channel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thestreamingadvisor.com/add-channel-pear-back-to-roku/|website=The Streaming Advisor|title= HOW TO PLEX: What Happened To Channel Pear On Roku How to Get It Back| author=Downey, Ryan|date=October 25, 2017}}</ref> on which they can discover, share, and view video files, MRSS feeds, and live IPTV streams from around the world, through devices such as [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]],<ref>{{cite web|website=Addictive Tips|url=https://www.addictivetips.com/media-streaming/channel-pear-kodi-addon/|title=Channel Pear Kodi Add-on, Installation Tutorial and Discovery| author=Larue-Langlois, Renaud Larue-Langlois|date= September 16, 2017}}</ref> [[Plex (software)|Plex]],<ref>{{cite web|website=Plex TV Forums|url=https://forums.plex.tv/t/rel-channel-pear-live-stream-discovery-iptv/113612|title=Channel Pear Live Stream Discovery}}</ref> and [[Roku]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Roku Guide|url=https://www.rokuguide.com/private-channels/channel-pear|title=Private Channels: Channel PEAR}}</ref>\n\nHospitality IPTV Ltd, having established many closed network IPTV systems, expanded in 2013 to OTT delivery platforms for markets in New Zealand, Australia, and Asia Pacific region.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[Google Fiber]] offers an IPTV service in various US cities which includes up to 1 Gigabit-speed internet and over 290 channels depending on package via the fiber optic network being built out in Kansas City Kansas and Kansas City Missouri.\n\nPEAR IPTV self-declares as \"the leading IPTV provider in the world\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://peariptv.com/|website= PEAR IPTV|title =Home Page}}</ref>\n\nMany of these IPTV solution vendors participated in the biennial Multiservice Switching Forum Interoperability 2008 (GMI) event which was coordinated by the [[MultiService Forum]] (MSF) at five sites worldwide from 20 to 31 October 2008. Test equipment vendors including Netrounds, [[Codenomicon]], [[Empirix]], Ixia, [[Mu Dynamics]] and [[Spirent]] joined solution vendors such as the companies listed above in one of the largest IPTV proving grounds ever deployed.\n\n==Service bundling==\nFor residential users, IPTV is often provided in conjunction with [[video on demand]] and may be bundled with [[Internet service]]s such as [[Internet access]] and [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) telecommunications services. Commercial bundling of IPTV, VoIP and Internet access is sometimes referred to in marketing as ''[[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]]'' service.  When these three are offered with cellular service, the combined service may be referred to as ''[[quadruple play]]''.\n\n==Regulation==\nHistorically, broadcast television has been regulated differently from telecommunications. As IPTV allows TV and VoD to be transmitted over IP networks, new regulatory issues arise.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/publications/ericsson_business_review/pdf/308/308_38_41_reshaping.pdf |title= Ericsson report on need for regulation |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081115174848/http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/publications/ericsson_business_review/pdf/308/308_38_41_reshaping.pdf |archive-date= 15 November 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(217&nbsp;KB)}}</ref>\nProfessor Eli M.

This is in contrast to delivery through traditional [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]], [[Satellite television|satellite]], and [[Cable television|cable]] television formats. Unlike [[download]]ed media, IPTV offers the ability to stream the source media continuously. As a result, a client media player can begin playing the content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately. This is known as [[streaming media]].\n\nAlthough IPTV uses the Internet protocol it is not limited to [[streaming television|television streamed]] from the [[Internet]] ([[Internet television]]). IPTV is widely deployed in subscriber-based telecommunications networks with high-speed access channels into end-user premises via [[set-top box]]es or other [[customer-premises equipment]]. IPTV is also used for media delivery around corporate and private networks. IPTV in the telecommunications arena is notable for its ongoing standardisation process (e.g., [[ETSI|European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]).\n\nIPTV services may be classified into [[live television]] and live media, with or without related interactivity; [[time shifting]] of media, e.g., [[catch-up TV]] (replays a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago), start-over TV (replays the current TV show from its beginning); and [[video on demand]] (VOD) which involves browsing and viewing items of a media catalogue.\n\n==Definition==\nHistorically, many different definitions of IPTV have appeared, including elementary streams{{clarify|date=February 2018}} over IP networks, [[MPEG transport stream]]s over IP networks and a number of proprietary systems. One official definition approved by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] focus group on IPTV (ITU-T FG IPTV) is:\n\n<blockquote>IPTV is defined as multimedia services such as television/video/audio/text/graphics/data delivered over IP based networks managed to provide the required level of quality of service and experience, security, interactivity and reliability.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/IPTV+Standardization+On+Track+Say+Industry+Experts.aspx |work=ITU-T Newslog |date=27 October 2006 |title=IPTV Standardization on Track Say Industry Experts |access-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916031736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/IPTV+Standardization+On+Track+Say+Industry+Experts.aspx |archive-date=16 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother definition of IPTV, relating to the telecommunications industry, is the one given by [[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions]] (ATIS) IPTV Exploratory Group in 2005:\n\n<blockquote>IPTV is defined as the secure and reliable delivery to subscribers of entertainment video and related services.  These services may include, for example, Live TV, Video On Demand (VOD) and [[Interactive television|Interactive TV (iTV)]]. These services are delivered across an access agnostic, packet switched network that employs the IP protocol to transport the audio, video and control signals. In contrast to video over the public Internet, with IPTV deployments, network security and performance are tightly managed to ensure a superior entertainment experience, resulting in a compelling business environment for content providers, advertisers and customers alike.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.atis.org/tops/IEG/ATIS_IPTV_EG_RPT_final.pdf |access-date=17 January 2012 |title=ATIS IPTV Exploratory Group Report and Recommendation to the TOPS Council |date=July 2006 |publisher=Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118031705/http://www.atis.org/tops/IEG/ATIS_IPTV_EG_RPT_final.pdf |archive-date=18 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nUp until the early 1990s, it was not thought possible that a [[television show|television programme]] could be squeezed into the limited [[telecommunication]] [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a [[copper]] [[telephone cable]] to provide a [[video-on-demand]] (VOD) television service of acceptable quality, as the required bandwidth of a [[digital television]] signal was around 200{{nbsp}}[[Mbps]], which was 2,000 times greater than the bandwidth of a speech signal over a copper [[telephone wire]].

Examples of types of commercial users include airports, schools, offices, hotels, and sports stadiums, to name just a few.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:IPTVnet.png|thumbnail|A simplified network diagram for IPTV]]\n\n===Elements===\n{{prose|section|date=April 2020}}\n* IPTV head-end: where live TV channels and AV sources are encoded, encrypted and delivered in the form of [[IP multicast]] streams.\n* Video on Demand (VOD) platform: where on-demand video assets are stored and served as IP unicast streams when a user makes a request. The VOD platform may sometimes be located with, and considered part of, the IPTV headend.\n* Interactive portal: allows the user to navigate within the different IPTV services, such as the VOD catalogue.\n* Delivery network: the packet-switched network that carries IP packets (unicast and multicast).\n* Endpoints: User equipment that can request, decode and deliver IPTV streams for display to the user. This can include computers and mobile devices as well as [[set-top box]]es.\n* Home [[TV gateway]]: the piece of equipment at a residential IPTV user's home that terminates the access link from the delivery network.\n* User [[set-top box]]: the piece of endpoint equipment that decodes and decrypts TV and VOD streams for display on the TV screen.\n\n===Architecture of a video server network===\nDepending on the network architecture of the service provider, there are two main types of video server architecture that can be considered for IPTV deployment: centralised and distributed.\n\nThe centralised architecture model is a relatively simple and easy to manage solution. Because all media content is stored in centralised servers, it does not require a comprehensive content distribution system. Centralised architecture is generally good for a network that provides relatively small VOD service deployment, has adequate core and edge bandwidth or has an efficient [[content delivery network]] (CDN).\n\nA distributed architecture has bandwidth usage advantages and inherent system management features that are essential for managing a larger server network. Distributed architecture requires intelligent and sophisticated content distribution technologies to augment effective delivery of multimedia contents over the service provider's network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inwf.com/pubs/print/aroc58_toc.html|title=inwf.com |website=www.inwf.com |access-date=25 April 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222175000/http://www.inwf.com/pubs/print/aroc58_toc.html|archive-date=22 December 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n===Residential IPTV home networks===\nIn many cases, the [[residential gateway]] that provides connectivity with the [[Internet access]] network is not located close to the IPTV set-top box.

Video compression is provided by either a [[H.263]] or [[H.264]] derived codec, audio is compressed via a [[MDCT]] based codec and then encapsulated in either an [[MPEG transport stream]] or [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]] packets or [[Flash Video]] packets for live or VoD streaming.  IP multicasting allows for live data to be sent to multiple receivers using a single multicast group address. [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]]/MPEG-4 AVC is commonly used for internet streaming over higher bit rate standards such as [[H.261]] and [[H.263]] which were more designed for [[ISDN]] video conferencing. [[H.262]]/MPEG-1/2 is generally not used as the bandwidth required would quite easily saturate a network which is why they are only used in single link broadcast or storage applications.\n\nIn standards-based IPTV systems, the primary underlying protocols used are:\n* Service provider-based streaming:\n** [[IGMP]] for subscribing to a live multicast stream (TV channel) and for changing from one live multicast stream to another (TV channel change). IP multicast operates within LANs (including VLANs) and across WANs also. IP multicast is usually routed in the network core by [[Protocol Independent Multicast]] (PIM), setting up correct distribution of multicast streams (TV channels) from their source all the way to the customers who wants to view them, duplicating received packets as needed.  On-demand content uses a negotiated unicast connection. [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) over [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) or the lower overhead [[H.222]] transport stream over [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) are generally the preferred methods of encapsulation.\n* [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based [[unicast]] only live and VoD streaming:\n** [[Adobe Flash Player]] prefers [[Real Time Messaging Protocol|RTMP]] over TCP with setup and control via either [[Action Message Format|AMF]] or [[XML]] or [[JSON]] transactions.\n** Apple iOS uses [[HTTP Live Streaming|HLS]] [[adaptive bitrate streaming]] over [[HTTP]] with setup and control via an embedded [[M3U]] playlist file.\n** Microsoft Silverlight uses [[Smooth Streaming|smooth streaming]] ([[adaptive bitrate streaming]]) over HTTP.\n* Web-based multicast live and unicast VoD streaming:\n** The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) recommends RTP over UDP or [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] transports with setup and control using [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]] over TCP.\n* [[Connected TV]]s, [[game console]]s, [[Set-top box#IPTV receiver|set-top boxes]] and [[network personal video recorder]]s:\n** local network content uses [[Universal Plug and Play#UPnP AV standards|UPnP AV]] for [[unicast]] via HTTP over TCP or for multicast live RTP over UDP.\n** Web-based content is provided through either inline Web plug-ins or a television broadcast-based application that uses a [[middleware]] language such as [[MHEG-5]] that triggers an event such as loading an inline Web browser using an [[Adobe Flash Player]] plug-in.\n\nA telecommunications company IPTV service is usually delivered over an investment-heavy [[Walled garden (technology)|walled garden network]].\n\nLocal IPTV, as used by businesses for [[audio visual]] AV distribution on their company networks is typically based on a mixture of:\n# Conventional TV reception equipment and IPTV encoders\n# IP[[TV gateway]]s that take broadcast MPEG channels and IP wrap them to create multicast streams.\n\n==Via satellite==\nAlthough IPTV and conventional [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] distribution have been seen as complementary technologies, they are likely to be increasingly used together in hybrid IPTV networks that deliver the highest levels of performance and reliability. IPTV is largely neutral to the transmission medium, and IP traffic is already routinely carried by satellite for [[Internet backbone]] trunking and corporate [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] networks.<ref>Berlocher, Greg and Freyer, Dan. \"IP And Satellite: Communications Worlds Merging\" ''Via Satellite'' January 2009 p 24\u201328</ref> The use of satellite to carry IP is fundamental to overcoming the greatest shortcoming of IPTV over terrestrial cables \u2013 the speed/bandwidth of the connection, as well as availability.\n\nThe copper twisted pair cabling that forms the [[last mile]] of the telephone and broadband network in many countries is not able to provide a sizeable proportion of the population with an IPTV service that matches even existing terrestrial or satellite digital TV distribution. For a competitive multi-channel TV service, a connection speed of 20&nbsp;Mbit/s is likely to be required, but unavailable to most potential customers.<ref>Taga, Karim. \"Hybrid delivery of content for IPTV\" ''InterComms'' Issue 11 August 2008 p 13\u201314</ref> The increasing popularity of [[high-definition television]] (with twice the data rate of [[Standard-definition television|SD video]]) increases connection speed requirements, or limits IPTV service quality and connection eligibility even further.\n\nHowever, satellites are capable of delivering in excess of 100&nbsp;Gbit/s via multi-spot beam technologies, making satellite a clear emerging technology for implementing IPTV networks. Satellite distribution can be included in an IPTV network architecture in several ways. The simplest to implement is an IPTV-[[Direct-broadcast satellite|direct to home]] (DTH) architecture, in which hybrid DVB-broadband [[set-top box]]es in subscriber homes integrate satellite and IP reception to give near-infinite bandwidth with return channel capabilities. In such a system, many live TV channels may be multicast via satellite (IP-encapsulated or as conventional [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] digital TV) with stored video-on-demand transmission via the broadband connection.

Since the emergence of online video aggregation sites, like [[YouTube]] and [[Vimeo]] in the mid-2000s, traditional [[pay TV]] operators have come under increasing pressure to provide their subscribers with a means of viewing [[Internet]]-based video [both professional and user-generated] on their televisions. At the same time, specialist [[Internet Protocol|IP]]-based operators [often telecommunications providers] have looked for ways to offer [[Analog television|analogue]] and [[digital terrestrial]] services to their operations, without adding either additional cost or complexity to their transmission operations. [[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]] is a valuable asset for operators, so many have looked for alternative ways to deliver these new services without investing in additional network infrastructures.\n\nA hybrid set-top allows content from a range of sources, including [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] broadcast, satellite, and cable, to be brought together with video delivered over the Internet via an Ethernet connection on the device. This enables television viewers to access a greater variety of content on their TV sets, without the need for a separate box for each service.\n\nHybrid IPTV set-top boxes also enable users to access a range of advanced interactive services, such as [[Video on demand|VOD]] / catch-up TV, as well as Internet applications, including [[Videotelephony|video telephony]], surveillance, gaming, shopping, [[E-Government|e-government]] accessed via a [[television set]].\n\nFrom a [[pay-TV]] operator's perspective, a hybrid IPTV set-top box gives them greater long-term flexibility by enabling them to deploy new services and applications as and when consumers require, most often without the need to upgrade equipment or for a technician to visit and reconfigure or swap out the device. This reduces the cost of launching new services, increases speed to market and limits disruption for consumers.<ref>[http://www.v-net.tv/Webcast.aspx?id=5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405064453/http://www.v-net.tv/Webcast.aspx?id=5 |date=5 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] (HbbTV) consortium of industry companies is currently{{When|date=January 2012}} promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast and broadband digital TV and multimedia applications with a single user interface.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=HbbTV Consortium |date=27 August 2009 |url=http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |title=New European initiative merges television with the power of the Internet |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007125549/http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |archive-date=7 October 2009 }}</ref> These trends led to the development of [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] set-top boxes that included both a [[ATSC tuner|broadcast tuner]] and an [[Internet access|Internet connection]]&nbsp;\u2013 usually an [[Ethernet]] port. The first commercially available hybrid IPTV set-top box was developed by [[Advanced Digital Broadcast]], a developer of digital television hardware and software, in 2005. The platform was developed for Spanish pay TV operator [[Telefonica]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltvnews.net/items/060911adb_spain.htm |title=ADB Delivers World's First Hybrid, Single-Chip, Advanced Video Coding, High Definition IPTV Set-Top Boxes To TELEF\u00d3NICA |publisher=Digitaltvnews.net |date= |access-date=15 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227141252/http://www.digitaltvnews.net/items/060911adb_spain.htm |archive-date=27 February 2012 }}</ref> and used as part of its Movistar TV service, launched to subscribers at the end of 2005.\n\nAn alternative approach is the IPTV version of the [[Headend in the Sky]] cable TV solution. Here, multiple TV channels are distributed via satellite to the ISP or IPTV provider's [[point of presence]] (POP) for IP-encapsulated distribution to individual subscribers as required by each subscriber.\n\nThis can provide a huge selection of channels to subscribers without overburdening Internet trunking to the POP, and enables an IPTV service to be offered to small or remote operators outside the reach of terrestrial high speed broadband connection. An example is a network combining fibre and satellite distribution via an [[SES New Skies]] satellite of 95 channels to Latin America and the Caribbean, operated by IPTV Americas.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=IPTV Americas |date=13 January 2009 |url=http://www.iptv-americas.tv/releaseDB.php?leng=&notID=47 |title=IPTV Americas Launches First IPTV Satellite Distribution Platform for Latin America and The Caribbean via SES NEW SKIES' NSS-806 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016015125/http://www.iptv-americas.tv/releaseDB.php?leng=&notID=47 |archive-date=16 October 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nWhile the future development of IPTV probably lies with a number of coexisting architectures and implementations, it is clear{{According to whom|date=January 2012}} that broadcasting of high bandwidth applications such as IPTV is accomplished more efficiently and cost-effectively using satellite<ref>International Datacasting Corporation [http://www.datacast.com/pg_SolutionIndex.php \"Why IP Over Satellite?\"].

Retrieved 18 January 2009.</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nThe Internet protocol-based platform offers significant advantages, including the ability to integrate television with other IP-based services like high speed Internet access and VoIP.\n\nA switched IP network also allows for the delivery of significantly more content and functionality. In a typical TV or satellite network, using broadcast video technology, all the content constantly flows downstream to each customer, and the customer switches the content at the set-top box. The customer can select from as many choices as the telecomms, cable or satellite company can stuff into the \"pipe\" flowing into the home. A switched IP network works differently. Content remains in the network, and only the content the customer selects is sent into the customer's home. That frees up bandwidth, and the customer's choice is less restricted by the size of the \"pipe\" into the home. This also implies that the customer's privacy could be compromised to a greater extent than is possible with traditional TV or satellite networks. It may also provide a means to hack into, or at least disrupt (see [[Denial-of-service attack|Denial of service]]) the private network.\n\n===Economics===\nThe cable industry's expenditures of approximately $1 billion per year are based on network updates to accommodate higher data speeds. Most operators use 2\u20133 channels to support maximum data speeds of 50&nbsp;Mbit/s to 100&nbsp;Mbit/s. However, because video streams require a high bit rate for much longer periods of time, the expenditures to support high amounts of video traffic will be much greater. This phenomenon is called persistency. Data persistency is routinely 5% while video persistency can easily reach 50%. As video traffic continues to grow, this means that significantly more [[Cable modem termination system|CMTS]] downstream channels will be required to carry this video content. Based on today's market, it is likely that industry expenditures for CMTS expansion could exceed $2 billion a year, virtually all of that expenditure being driven by video traffic. Adoption of IPTV for carrying the majority of this traffic could save the industry approximately 75% of this capital expenditure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.curvedview.com/economics-iptv/|title=The Economics of IPTV|date=2 February 2015|language=en-US|access-date=23 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920030343/http://www.curvedview.com/economics-iptv/|archive-date=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Interactivity===\nAn IP-based platform also allows significant opportunities to make the TV viewing experience more interactive and personalised.\nThe supplier may, for example, include an interactive programme guide that allows viewers to search for content by title or actor's name, or a [[picture-in-picture]] functionality that allows them to \"channel surf\" without leaving the programme they're watching. Viewers may be able to look up a player's stats while watching a sports game, or control the camera angle. They also may be able to access photos or music from their PC on their television, use a wireless phone to schedule a recording of their favourite show, or even adjust parental controls so their child can watch a documentary for a school report, while they're away from home.\n\nIn order that there can take place an interaction between the receiver and the transmitter, a feedback channel is needed. Due to this, terrestrial, satellite, and cable networks for television do not allow interactivity. However, interactivity with those networks can be possible by combining TV networks with data networks such as the [[Internet]] or a mobile communication network.\n\n===Video-on-demand===\nIPTV technology is bringing [[video on demand]] (VoD) to television,<ref>[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ Broadband Users Control What They Watch and When] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420143608/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ |date=20 April 2010 }}</ref> which permits a customer to browse an online programme or film catalogue, to watch trailers and to then select a selected recording. The [[playout]] of the selected item starts nearly instantaneously on the customer's TV or PC.\n\nTechnically, when the customer selects the movie, a [[Point-to-Point Protocol|point-to-point]] unicast connection is set up between the customer's decoder (set-top box or PC) and the delivering streaming server. The signalling for the trick play functionality (pause, slow-motion, wind/rewind etc.) is assured by RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol).\n\nThe most common codecs used for VoD are [[MPEG-2]], [[MPEG-4]] and [[VC-1]].\n\nIn an attempt to avoid content piracy, the VoD content is usually encrypted. Whilst [[encryption]] of satellite and cable TV broadcasts is an old practice, with IPTV technology it can effectively be thought of as a form of [[Digital rights management]]. A film that is chosen, for example, may be playable for 24 hours following payment, after which time it becomes unavailable.\n\n===IPTV-based converged services===\nAnother advantage is the opportunity for integration and convergence. This opportunity is amplified when using IMS-based solutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Session and Media Signalling for IPTV via IMS|url=http://c-mobile.ptinovacao.pt/files/PaperMobilWare2008.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625075612/http://c-mobile.ptinovacao.pt/files/PaperMobilWare2008.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 June 2008|website=MobileWare'08|authors=Riede, Christian & Al-Hezmi, Adel & Magedanz, Thomas||location= Innsbruck, Austria||isbn=|date=12 February 2008 }}</ref> Converged services implies interaction of existing services in a seamless manner to create new value added services. One example is on-screen [[Caller ID]], getting Caller ID on a TV, and the ability to handle it (send it to voice mail, etc.). IP-based services help to enable efforts to provide consumers anytime-anywhere access to content over their televisions, PCs, and mobile device, and to integrate services and content to tie them together. Within businesses and institutions, IPTV eliminates the need to run a parallel infrastructure to deliver live and stored video services.\n\n==Limitations==\nIPTV is sensitive to packet loss and delays if the streamed data is unreliable. IPTV has strict minimum speed requirements in order to facilitate the right number of frames per second to deliver moving pictures. This means that the limited connection speed and bandwidth available for a large IPTV customer base can reduce the service quality delivered.\n\nAlthough a few countries have very high-speed broadband-enabled populations, such as [[South Korea]] with 6 million homes benefiting from a minimum connection speed of 100&nbsp;Mbit/s, in other countries (such as the UK) legacy networks struggle to provide 3\u20135&nbsp;Mbit/s<ref>Bulkley, Kate. \"IPTV\u2019s Eastern Promise\" ''Digital TV Europe'' October 2008 p 48</ref>{{Update after|2013|8|13}} and so simultaneous provision to the home of TV channels, VOIP and Internet access may not be viable. The last-mile delivery for IPTV usually has a bandwidth restriction that only allows a small number of simultaneous TV channel streams&nbsp;\u2013 typically from one to three&nbsp;\u2013 to be delivered.<ref>Brown, Peter J. \"Super Headends And High Expectations\" ''Via Satellite'' April 2006 p 18\u201330</ref>\n\nStreaming IPTV across wireless links within the home has proved troublesome; not due to bandwidth limitations as many{{Who|date=January 2012}} assume, but due to issues with multipath and reflections of the RF signal carrying the IP data packets. An IPTV stream is sensitive to packets arriving at the right time and in the right order. Improvements in wireless technology are now{{When|date=January 2012}} starting to provide equipment to solve the problem.<ref>Market Wire [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091001092108/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200806/ai_n26682515 \"ZyXEL Announces Industry's First ADSL2/2+ 802.11n Gateway and New IPTV Product Offerings\"] June 2008</ref>\n\nDue to the limitations of wireless, most IPTV service providers today use wired home networking technologies instead of wireless technologies like [[IEEE 802.11]]. Service providers such as AT&T (which makes extensive use of wireline home networking as part of its [[AT&T U-verse]] IPTV service) have expressed support for the work done in this direction by [[ITU-T]], which has adopted Recommendation [[G.hn]] (also known as G.9960), which is a next-generation home networking standard that specifies a common PHY/MAC that can operate over any home wiring (power lines, phone lines or coaxial cables).<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/homepna-homegrid-sign-liaison-agreement/story.aspx?guid={C8E4BB07-375A-41E5-8B05-2E33222E44C2}&dist=msr_9 HomePNA and HomeGrid Sign Liaison Agreement]{{dead link|date=February 2016}}, Groups Work to Promote New ITU G.hn Global Wired Home Networking Standard</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everywire.com/2009/02/att-participating-in-ghn-standard-development-1.html|title=AT&T Participating in G.hn Standard Development|author=|date=|website=everywire.com|access-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810051112/http://www.everywire.com/2009/02/att-participating-in-ghn-standard-development-1.html|archive-date=10 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Latency===\nThe [[latency (engineering)|latency]] inherent in the use of [[Satellite Internet access|satellite Internet]] is often held up as reason why satellites cannot be successfully used for IPTV. In practice, however, latency is not an important factor for IPTV, since it is a service that does not require real-time transmission, as is the case with telephony or videoconferencing services.\n\nIt is the latency of response to requests to change channel, display an EPG, etc. that most affects customers\u2019 perceived quality of service, and these problems affect satellite IPTV no more than terrestrial IPTV. Command latency problems, faced by terrestrial IPTV networks with insufficient bandwidth as their customer base grows, may be solved by the high capacity of satellite distribution.\n\nSatellite distribution does suffer from latency&nbsp;\u2013 the time for the signal to travel up from the hub to the satellite and back down to the user is around 0.25 seconds, and cannot be reduced. However, the effects of this delay are mitigated in real-life systems using data compression, TCP-acceleration, and HTTP pre-fetching.<ref>Newtec Productions NV [http://www.newtec.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/product_leaflets/sat3Play/Sat3Play_Ku-band_Terminal_TP210_R1.pdf \"TP210 Sat3Play Broadband Terminal\"] (Version R2/06.2010).

Existing [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] TV channels that [[simulcast]] by both terrestrial and satellite transmissions experience the same 0.25-second delay difference between the two services with no detrimental effect, and it goes unnoticed by viewers.\n\n==Bandwidth requirements==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Figure2a.jpg|thumb|400px|Bandwidth capacity for simultaneously two HDTV streams, two SD streams, additional to HSD and voice]]\n\nDigital video is a combination of sequence of digital images, and they are made up of [[pixel]]s or picture elements. Each pixel has two values, which are [[luminance]] and [[chrominance]]. Luminance is representing intensity of the pixel; chrominance represents the colour of the pixel. Three bytes would be used to represent the colour of the high quality image for a true colour technique. A sequence of images is creating the digital video, in that case, images are called as frames.\n\nMovies use 24 frames per second; however, the rate of the frames can change according to territories' electrical systems so that there are different kinds of frame rates, for instance, North America is using approximately 30 frames per second where the Europe television frame rate is 25 frames per second. Each digital video has dimensions width and height; when referred to analogue television, the dimension for SDTV is 720\u00d7480 pixels, on the other hand, numerous HDTV requires 1920\u00d71080 pixels. Moreover, whilst for SDTV, two bytes (16 bits) is enough to create the colour depth, HDTV requires three bytes (24 bits) to create the colour depth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThereby, with a rate of 30 frames/second, the uncompressed data rate for SDTV becomes 30\u00d7720\u00d7480\u00d716,{{vague|date=July 2017}} in other words, 147,456,000 bits per second. Moreover, for HDTV, at the same frame rate, uncompressed date rate becomes 30\u00d71920\u00d71080\u00d724 or 1,492,992,000 bits per second. Using that simple calculation, a service provider's service delivery to the subscribers is limited unless a lossy compression method is used.\n\nThere is no absolute answer for the bandwidth requirement for the IPTV service because the bandwidth requirement is increasing due to the devices inside the household. Thus, currently compressed HDTV content can be delivered at a data rate between 8 and 10&nbsp;Mbit/s, but if the home of the consumer equipped with several HDTV outputs, this rate will be multiplied respectively.\n\nThe high-speed data transfer will increase the needed bandwidth for the viewer, at least 2&nbsp;Mbit/s is needed to use web-based applications on the computer. Additionally to that, 64&nbsp;kbit/s is required to use landline telephone for the property. In minimal usage, to receive an IPTV triple-play service requires 13&nbsp;Mbit/s to process in a household.\n\n==Privacy implications==\nDue to limitations in bandwidth, an IPTV channel is delivered to the user one at a time, as opposed to the traditional multiplexed delivery. Changing a channel requires requesting the head-end server to provide a different broadcast stream, much like [[Video on demand|VOD]] (For VOD the stream is delivered using [[unicast]], for the normal TV signal multicast is used). This could enable the service provider to accurately track each and every programme watched and the duration of watching for each viewer; broadcasters and advertisers could then understand their audience and programming better with accurate data and [[targeted advertising]].\n\nIn conjunction with regulatory differences between IPTV and cable TV, this tracking could pose a threat to privacy according to critics.<ref>[http://www.cedmagazine.com/iptv-privacy-risks.aspx IPTV privacy risks<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105172921/http://www.cedmagazine.com/iptv-privacy-risks.aspx |date=5 January 2010 }}</ref>  For IP multicast scenarios, since a particular multicast group (TV channel) needs to be requested before it can be viewed, the same privacy concerns apply.\n\n==Vendors==\nGlobal sales of IPTV systems exceeded US$2 billion in 2007, although only a small number of companies supply most current IPTV system solutions. Some, such as [[Movistar TV]], were formed by telecoms operators themselves, to minimise external costs, a tactic also used by [[PCCW]] of [[Hong Kong]]. Some major telecoms vendors are also active in this space, notably [[Accenture]] (Accenture Video Solution), [[Alcatel-Lucent]] (sometimes working with Movistar TV), [[Ericsson]] (notably since acquiring [[Tandberg Television]]), [[Huawei]], [[NEC]], [[PTCL Smart TV]], [[Sri Lanka Telecom]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson]], and [[ZTE]], as are some IT houses, led by [[Microsoft]]. Delaware-based AlphaOTT Tokyo-based The New Media Group, Malaysian-based [[Select-TV]], Oslo/Norway-based SnapTV, and California-based [[UTStarcom]], Inc. also offer end-to-end networking infrastructure for IPTV-based services, and Hong Kong-based BNS Ltd. provides turnkey open platform IPTV technology solutions. \n\nChannel PEAR is a \"collaborative, cloud-based media platform\"<ref>{{cite web|website=Channel PEAR |title=Login|url=https://channelpear.com/login/}}</ref> that allows users to create a private channel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thestreamingadvisor.com/add-channel-pear-back-to-roku/|website=The Streaming Advisor|title= HOW TO PLEX: What Happened To Channel Pear On Roku How to Get It Back| author=Downey, Ryan|date=October 25, 2017}}</ref> on which they can discover, share, and view video files, MRSS feeds, and live IPTV streams from around the world, through devices such as [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]],<ref>{{cite web|website=Addictive Tips|url=https://www.addictivetips.com/media-streaming/channel-pear-kodi-addon/|title=Channel Pear Kodi Add-on, Installation Tutorial and Discovery| author=Larue-Langlois, Renaud Larue-Langlois|date= September 16, 2017}}</ref> [[Plex (software)|Plex]],<ref>{{cite web|website=Plex TV Forums|url=https://forums.plex.tv/t/rel-channel-pear-live-stream-discovery-iptv/113612|title=Channel Pear Live Stream Discovery}}</ref> and [[Roku]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Roku Guide|url=https://www.rokuguide.com/private-channels/channel-pear|title=Private Channels: Channel PEAR}}</ref>\n\nHospitality IPTV Ltd, having established many closed network IPTV systems, expanded in 2013 to OTT delivery platforms for markets in New Zealand, Australia, and Asia Pacific region.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[Google Fiber]] offers an IPTV service in various US cities which includes up to 1 Gigabit-speed internet and over 290 channels depending on package via the fiber optic network being built out in Kansas City Kansas and Kansas City Missouri.\n\nPEAR IPTV self-declares as \"the leading IPTV provider in the world\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://peariptv.com/|website= PEAR IPTV|title =Home Page}}</ref>\n\nMany of these IPTV solution vendors participated in the biennial Multiservice Switching Forum Interoperability 2008 (GMI) event which was coordinated by the [[MultiService Forum]] (MSF) at five sites worldwide from 20 to 31 October 2008. Test equipment vendors including Netrounds, [[Codenomicon]], [[Empirix]], Ixia, [[Mu Dynamics]] and [[Spirent]] joined solution vendors such as the companies listed above in one of the largest IPTV proving grounds ever deployed.\n\n==Service bundling==\nFor residential users, IPTV is often provided in conjunction with [[video on demand]] and may be bundled with [[Internet service]]s such as [[Internet access]] and [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) telecommunications services. Commercial bundling of IPTV, VoIP and Internet access is sometimes referred to in marketing as ''[[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]]'' service.  When these three are offered with cellular service, the combined service may be referred to as ''[[quadruple play]]''.\n\n==Regulation==\nHistorically, broadcast television has been regulated differently from telecommunications. As IPTV allows TV and VoD to be transmitted over IP networks, new regulatory issues arise.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/publications/ericsson_business_review/pdf/308/308_38_41_reshaping.pdf |title= Ericsson report on need for regulation |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081115174848/http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/publications/ericsson_business_review/pdf/308/308_38_41_reshaping.pdf |archive-date= 15 November 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(217&nbsp;KB)}}</ref>\nProfessor Eli M.

Symptoms vary by tree species but generally consist of leaf discoloration, wilt, defoliation, and death. The fungus spreads from diseased to healthy trees overland by insect or other airborne vectors and underground by naturally grafted tree roots. Management of the disease historically meant preventing infection by not wounding oaks during certain time periods, removing diseased oaks that will produce spores (sanitation), and breaking root connections with vibratory plows, trenchers, rock saws or hoes. Present methods focus on reducing or eliminating monocultures and restoring ecosystems correctly using soils baseline information. Fungicides are used for preventive treatments in urban areas. Oak wilt poses a danger for oak wood products and shade trees in urban areas.\n\n==Hosts and symptoms==\n[[File:Oak wilt symptoms.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of oak wilt symptoms|Photograph of leaf and whole tree symptoms of oak wilt in a red oak tree. Joseph O'Brien, USDA Forest Service, Bugwood.org]]\n\nOak wilt is one of three devastating North American vascular wilt diseases and was first seen in Wisconsin in the 1940s.  Within the last decade, it has spread into new counties in northern Wisconsin, counties northwest and northeast of the Twin Cities in Minnesota and also new locations in northeastern states.  The other two vascular wilts and their destructive time periods are [[chestnut blight]] (1900-1950) and [[Dutch elm disease]] (1928 - 1980).\n\nVascular wilts, including oak wilt, kill by fooling the tree into killing itself; the fungus or pathogen does not kill the tree or host.  The tree's reaction-to fungus entering into sapwood, by walling off the fungus, causes shutdown of water supply upward, then wilting, thus killing off the fungus doesn't eradicate the problem, keeping the water supply open and flowing upward is the main problem.  Certain elements like Boron are crucial to the trees' physiological well being, especially with translocation of fluids.  Additionally, copper and chemotherapies have been used to keep the tree or plant from killing itself via wilting[http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=EY7524088].\n\nOak wilt infects and kills all oak species but affects the two main groups, [[red oak|red]] and [[white oak]]s, differently. Mostly, red oak group trees die faster from oak wilt disease than white oak group trees. Oaks in North and Central America are sorted into two groups based mostly upon the porosity and corresponding leaf shape. The white oak group have rounded leaf edges and pores, also known as xylem or sapwood, are clogged with [[tylosis (botany)|tyloses]]. The red oak group have pointed leaf edges and pores are large and open.\n \nCommon names of oaks are based upon folklore or customs, which leads-to black oaks being in the red oak group. In the upper midwest, red oak group trees like black, northern red and northern pin are most threatened by oak wilt for two reasons: they die faster and they produce spore mats, known also as spore pads or pressure pads.  Spore mats are the fruiting bodies of the oak wilt fungus and, when ripening or sporulating, can spread disease overland.   Overland spread of oak wilt from white oaks is not a problem because white oak group trees rarely produce spore mats. When infected, oaks in the red oak group die over the course of a single summer. These oaks typically die from the top of the tree down as leaves become a bronze color and fall off the tree.  Another symptom is discoloration of the vascular tissues. Brown streaks or spots can be seen under the bark in the sapwood; oak wilt specialists call this stage II.[[File:Oak_Wilt_Dropped_Leaves_Polk_County_WI_Noon_July_14,_2016.png|thumb|right|Sudden leaf drop July red oak]]\n\nOaks in the white oak group, [[Quercus alba|white]], [[Quercus bicolor|swamp white]], and [[Quercus macrocarpa|bur]], die slower when infected (white oak in particular) and can live for several years after infection, losing a few branches each season from the top down. Bur oaks tend to die faster than others in the white oak group, although not as fast as trees in the red oak group. Symptoms in white oak are similar to those in red oak. Quercus virginiana, the southern live oak, is the most common of 31 species of evergreen oaks and is in the white oak group.\n\nOaks with oak wilt stand out with their dead crowns compared to a green canopy in the summer, so much so that oak wilt infections can be spotted from the air.\n\nNorthern pin oak (''Q. ellipsoidalis'') infection and spread are extreme when monocultures exist. Northern pin oak forests are typically found on entisol soils (aka barren, river terrace or lakebed sands) in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and these forest ecosystems are often misidentified as oak savannas, which are prairie - not forest - ecosystems. Mistaking northern pin oak forest monocultures for oak savannas, then burning them for oak savanna restoration, has made state and federal lands north of Minneapolis-St Paul the largest oak wilt disease reservoirs in Minnesota.<ref>Nelson, Steven (2011). ''Savanna Soils of Minnesota.'' Minnesota: Self. pp. 21-22,29-30. {{ISBN|978-0-615-50320-2}}.</ref>\n\nWilt and death in [[Live oak]] usually occurs within six months of infection. Live oak foliar symptoms differ from those of red and white oak. Infected live oak leaves develop yellow colored veins then eventually die and turn brown before falling off the tree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.texasoakwilt.org/Documents/Stewardship/OakWilt_English.pdf |title=How to identify and manage oak wilt in Texas |date= June 2003 |website=Texasokwilt.org |publisher=USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station |access-date= June 12, 2017 |quote=Leaves on diseased live oaks often develop chlorotic (yellow colored) veins that eventually die / turn brown}}</ref>\n\n==Disease Cycle==\n[[File:Oak Wilt cycle.gif|thumb|alt=Illustration of the oak wilt disease cycle|Illustration of the oak wilt disease cycle by Julie Martinez]]\n\n[[File:Ceratocystis fagacearum endoconidia.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Ceratocystis fagacearum endoconidia|Photograph of spores produced by the oak wilt fungus. (a) Endoconidia (b) Conidiophore]]\n\nThe oak wilt fungus spreads in two basic ways: transfer of spores from diseased to healthy trees overland by insect and other vectors and movement underground of the fungus from a diseased tree to a healthy tree through [[grafting|root grafts]]. [[File:Root Graft.png|thumb|left|Root Graft of hardwood tree after excavation following vibratory plowing]] \n====Overland====\nSpores are the seeds of a fungus.  If conditions - temperature, moisture content, wood pH - are right after the oak has wilted and died, spore mats form under the bark of the tree. [[File:Spore_Mats_Car_Keys_May_2015.jpg|thumb|left|Bark removed by squirrels attracted-to fruity odor. Spore mats stage III]]\n\nSpore mats produce asexual spores called endoconidia, which are barrel shaped and produced in chains.  [[File:The Real Dr Spore Mat.jpg|thumb|right|Wood caramel colored, spore mats stage III]]Conidia are often dispersed by air and rain and also by insects and other agents.<ref>K\u00e4\u00e4rik, A. (1983).\"Atlas of Airborne Fungal Spores in Europe\". Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer-Verlag. p. 7 {{ISBN|3-540-11900-0}}.</ref> If compatible mating types are present, these mats will also produce sexual spores called ascospores in fruiting structures called perithecia.  Ascospores are spread by water, insects and other agents.<ref>K\u00e4\u00e4rik, A. (1983).\"Atlas of Airborne Fungal Spores in Europe\". Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer-Verlag. p. 7 {{ISBN|3-540-11900-0}}.</ref>    \nCertain species of [[Nitidulidae|sap beetles]] plus other insects, birds and animals are attracted to the fruity smell of oak wilt spore mats. \n\nSpore mats/pressure pads increase in size, eventually breaking the bark covering them, which sends the spores' fruity odor out into the area, attracting sap beetles and other insects, birds and animals, like squirrels. The oak wilt disease \"selling\" business is now open. [[File:SpMatClose.jpg|thumb|left|Spore Mat stage III meaning infectious]]One example of overland spread is sap beetles picking-up spores from diseased red oaks then depositing them onto fresh wounds made on healthy oaks.  The oak wilt \"buying\" business is now open...for 2 days only.  New infections in areas with no history of oak wilt occur by this overland transmission route.[[File:Spore_Mats_Stage_IV-V.jpg|thumb|right|Spore mats (dark patches) stage IV - V are no longer infectious]]  However, not all all red oaks that died in one year produce spores/sporulate the next year between April and July. Small red oaks 6 - 10 inch dbh tend to sporulate the autumn of the year they got infected, or not at all; small trees, once dead, dry out faster than large trees and oak wilt fungus cannot survive in that dry environment.  Roughly 15 to 30 percent of red oaks greater than 10 inch dbh will sporulate April - July the year following infection.  The other 70 - 85 percent of infected red oaks will sporulate, either before April or after July the following year or, not at all, because wood rotting fungi (Trichoderma) is already in the oak and out-competes/kills the oak wilt fungus.\n====Underground====\nOak wilt moves from diseased trees to healthy trees through roots that have become interconnected (root [[grafting|grafts]]). \nTransmission via root grafts is the most common means of spread, and makes up more than 85 % of new infections every year.  Oaks within 50 - 150 feet (15 - 50 meters) of a diseased oak can be infected via root graft transmission.  In this case, spores (also endoconidia) produced inside the tree travel upward through vascular tissue in the wood, known as the xylem.  Most root grafts form between oaks of the same species and of the same generation; it's rare for a 60 year old oak to root graft with a 15 year old oak of same species.  Red oak roots graft more commonly than do white oak roots, and grafts between red and white oaks are very rare.\n\n==Environment==\nIn the Midwest and eastern United States, conditions are usually favorable for spore production and beetle activity during spring and early summer.  In Texas, mat formation is most common in late fall and winter. Frequency of root graft formation, and therefore root graft transmission, is affected by soil type and stand composition (diversity of tree species). See disease cycle and management sections for details.\n\n==Management==\nLandowners and managers have to remember that oaks love light and heat more than other forest tree species; they are one of the few tree species that survive in the prairie regions.  Releasing or thinning oaks from competition, which gives remaining oaks more light, moisture and nutrients, should always be the primary goal, whether or not oak wilt is present.  Oak wilt is similar to [[Dutch elm disease]] but more controllable. Beetles carrying oak wilt do not have chewing mouth parts, and need some other creature or physical damage to wound the tree, whereas beetles that carry Dutch elm disease do have chewing mouth parts. Prevention is essential, as there is no permanent cure. To prevent overland spread, oaks should not be wounded, including [[pruning|pruned]], in the [[spring (season)|spring]] months in the east and Midwest or February through June in Texas. Care should be taken to prevent injury to oaks during this period, particularly during construction activities. Painting wounds less than 48 hours old is advised if oaks are wounded in the spring by wind or human caused damage. Painting wounds more than 48 hours old is not helpful because the oak by that time has compartmentalized (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CODIT) the injury/wound.  Reducing the source of spores is helpful. When a dead red oak has not sporulated - hasn't reached stage III yet - before the following spring, it should be chipped or mulched onsite, then burned at a CHP (combined heat & power) plant.  If that is not possible, wood greater than 5\" diameter can be split into firewood size pieces then left onsite to dry before spring, or covered with plastic sheeting to effect composting. Heat from composting should destroy the fungus. Logs or firewood from red oak group trees that have died of oak wilt should never be moved to unaffected areas.\n\n====Root Graft or Overland Infection?====\nThe first oak in any infection center is always infected from overland spread; additional oaks killed from the disease in that infection center are killed from underground root graft spread.  Before control plans are made, the landowner or land manager (forester, arborist) needs to find out how the infection got there and what type (underground, overland or both) it is.  Root graft infections move slowly, so additional root graft infections may not be seen for 1-3 years.  It is impossible for one oak infected via overland to infect & wilt seventeen additional oaks via root graft transmission, in less than 4 months (see Kerrick, Minnesota oak wilt photo, below).  If one sees more than half dozen oaks wilting during one summer in a new infection with healthy oaks in between means infections started from overland route/storm event, not underground.  In that case, each wilting oak is a separate infection center, not part of one infection center.  One should also look at the site to confirm whether or not it's an overland infection.  Overland infections occur on or near hilltops or other exposed areas, where taller oaks get wounded, then infected, and shorter oaks look healthy.  A spread pattern with no obvious direction usually means multiple airborne/overland infections.  Root graft infections can \"fan\" out in 360 degree pattern, but tend to head faster in one or two directions because of soil and topography changes and tree species arrangement/diversity. [[File:Kost_Oak_Savanna_OW_cleanup_autumn_2007.jpg|thumb|left|Oak wilt and buckthorn cleanup on oak savanna in Chisago County, Minnesota autumn/after leaf drop 2007]]  A birds-eye view of an infection center, during the middle of summer, going from oldest to newest based on colors would show: stone dead gray, brown, yellow, orange, green.  So, if one doesn't see these color sequences or, a hub and spoke pattern radiating out, they are probably looking at multiple airborne infections.  Looks can be deceiving because 2-6 large wilting oaks may often have only 1-2 trees left nearby to infect.  Compared-to one oak deep in the woods that is just starting to wilt that can lead-to 2-5 dozen more nearby oaks dying in the next 5 years.  So, proper ground ID & diagnosis is crucial for stopping this disease.  Stopping spread with multiple infections means plowlines will be further out, so natural barriers should be located first.  In the Lake States, a vibratory plow line is installed 54 to 72 inches deep in the ground and 60 - 150 feet away from the diseased oak.  Plowing done correctly ruptures healthy roots that could, in the future, transmit oak wilt to neighboring healthy trees.  Installing plow lines far enough away from diseased oaks is key to preventing root graft disease transmission.  In southern states like Texas, where heavy clay or Caliche soils are prevalent, rocksaws are commonly used in lieu of vibratory plows.  Infected oaks should not be cut down before vibratory plowing because, doing so will speed up oak wilt root graft spread to nearby healthy oaks.  Base of trunk or root flare injections of azole or copper based fungicides can help contain foliar - or top down - infections but are costly and have less success containing root graft - bottom up - transmission of oak wilt.\n\n\n====Strategies - Containment vs. Control====\nThere is a big difference between containment and control.  Containment happens within a few hours or days; control takes weeks or many months.  The lack of appreciation and understanding for disease control methods and strategies has led to a lot of landowners and taxpayers thinking there is no way to control oak wilt.  Despite 40-50 years of work & study showing oak wilt as one of the easiest to control forest diseases in North America.  Putting a plowline around an oak wilt infection center is containment, which is not controlling the disease.  Going inside the containment lines or natural barriers/edges/cover type changes and making sure all oak wilt infections are dead and gone is control.  Landowners and managers have to ask themselves this question (are we going to be containing or controlling this disease?) before starting a disease control project, whether in a small yard or on hundreds of acres.  Control also means removal and processing - mostly by logging - of future spore-producing oaks.  For the last 40-50 years, experienced professionals throughout North America have been doing insect & disease control year round, not four or six months per year.  They stop oak wilt spread by identifying future spore producing red oaks, which trees to protect from wounding, which trees not threatened by root graft infection then, respond same day to tree health changes.  Agriculture and construction work starts in April-May each year, so it behooves oak wilt specialists to continue disease control work and prevention right through spring and early summer.\n[[File:White_Oak_on_Nymore_soils_Chisago_County_2012.jpg|thumb|right|Healthy white oak (Q. alba) remaining after cleaning up 7-1-11 storm damage & oak wilt infections, 13 months after storm, 2012, Chisago County Minnesota]]\nAfter 2005, treatment goals shifted towards \"passive oak wilt control\" on properties less than 5 acres and treating to natural barriers or edges for large acreages. Passive control means letting the disease burn out over a few years which allows other native tree and shrub species to take over. Treating to natural barriers means restoring to native forest or savanna species by harvesting out to where oak wilt can no longer expand via root grafts. All oaks of the species that is infected are logged out, whether they are infected or healthy. Passive oak wilt control on large acreages creates short and long term problems for oaks. White oak group trees are at risk for infection from nearby sporulating red oak group trees for the short term; invasive species can take over and monocultures of oaks can re-develop that sustain oak wilt infections for 50-100 more years making for long term risks. Treating to natural barriers/edges or cover type changes is by far the best method to use when controlling oak wilt on large acreages.\n\n==Importance==\n\nOak wilt is a devastating disease, killing trees rapidly in a single season. It is an important disease in urban areas where a few oak trees in a homeowner's yard may be of great value. If one tree in the homeowners yard becomes infected it will die. Not only will the homeowner need to pay to remove the dead tree, they will also need to protect the rest of the oak trees in their yard or face the prospect that remaining oaks will continue to die. Loss of trees from a property can also lead to a decrease in property value. Even if a homeowner is vigilant about pruning at the correct time, storms and construction can damage trees and introduce oak wilt into a neighborhood.  In forest systems, oak wilt is an important disease of oak produced for hardwood lumber and railroad ties.\n\n===July 1, 2011 Windstorm in Minnesota and Wisconsin===\n\n[[File:Kerrick_Oak_Wilt_8-19-16_Spawned-_from_7-1-2011_Infection_Centers.png|thumb|left|North Flank of 7-1-2011 Windstorm went thru northern Pine and Carlton Counties Minnesota.

West-facing slopes on the east bank (Wisconsin side) and terrace crests in the St. Croix river valley were hit hard with wind damage and oak wilt infections.  Hilltops and bottoms and field edges, where oaks were more exposed, also had more serious wind and oak wilt damage.  Approximately 3/4 million acres in Minnesota, possibly 10 times that area for Wisconsin<ref>WI DNR https://forestrynews.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/12/03/new-northern-oak-wilt-detections/</ref> and up to the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, were affected by the storm. Millions of freshly wounded oak trees were now open to infection from trillions of oak wilt spores carried-in by the storm.\n\n====Infection Levels-Spore Loads====\nIt's difficult for oaks to get infected in mid summer - after July 1 - because it's too hot for red oaks to sporulate and latewood cell development has been underway since early to mid-June. Two factors changed this around on July 1, 2011: the trillions of oak wilt spores carried-in from west-southwest and the windstorm's tearing/shredding/breaking-apart trees which re-opened oaks' 2011 & 2010 earlywood cells (earlywood is also called ''springwood'', and latewood goes by the name ''summerwood'' in some areas). The oak wilt fungus is too big to fit within the smaller latewood cells, but can fit within and move upward through the much larger earlywood cells. This storm damage increased the chances of infection 1,000 - 1,000,000 times the usual. Instead of one new infection per 1,500 acres, foresters were seeing one new infection per 10 acres. The manageable level of oak wilt disease is one infection per 640 acres.[[File:Oak_Wilt_Infection_Center_in_2013_Created_7-1-2011_Rushseba_Township,_Chisago_County,_Minnesota.jpg|thumb|right|7-1-2011 storm-caused oak wilt on terrace crest in Rushsheba Township, Chisago County, Minnesota]][[File:East_Farmington_3_Infection_Centers_photo_taken_8-8-16.png|thumb|left|South Flank of 7-1-2011 Windstorm went thru St. Croix County, Wisconsin.  Photo shows one of five 7-1-11 infection centers on hilltop near East Farmington, Wisconsin]]\nOne year after the storm, in summer 2012, oak wilt specialists found 10 - 20 infections per 100 acres both in Rushseba Township, Chisago County Minnesota and at St. Croix State Park<ref>Minnesota DNR Forestry 2012 Forest Health Annual Report, p. 37</ref>  in Pine County, Minnesota. \nWounding & infecting at ten oaks per 100 acres, one oak per 100 acres or one oak per 200 acres presents a serious threat to the oak resource. St. Croix State Park's northern-most infected oak and southern-most infected oak were 10 miles apart. This broad coverage of oak wilt blanketing millions of acres is achieved only with huge spore supplies and re-opening of that years' earlywood cells.\n====Detection====\nThe use of spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging show promise for accurate detection of the disease <ref> Fallon, B., A. Yang, C. Lapadat, I. Armour, J. Juzwik, R. A. Montgomery, and J. Cavender-Bares. 2020. Spectral differentiation of oak wilt from foliar fungal disease and drought is correlated with physiological changes. Tree Physiology 40:377-390.\nhttps://academic.oup.com/treephys/article/40/3/377/5728678 </ref> and are currently being tested for large scale detection and monitoring.\n\n====Sources====\nSources with that many hundreds of acres of oak wilt spores were upwind  (240 degrees/west southwest) in the three oak wilt \"reservoirs\" on state and federal lands in Sherburne, Anoka, Isanti and Chisago counties of Minnesota (see Hosts and Symptoms). The sources of oak wilt spores were not nearby.\n\n====Rate of Spread====\nBefore the windstorm, oak wilt could spread north at three quarters of a mile per year and east or west at one and one half miles per year.<ref>Minnesota DNR Forestry (2001).</ref>  During the storm, oak wilt spread at up to 100 miles per hour. In the two years following the 2011 storm, infections were found at new locations in four Minnesota and at least one (Sawyer) of three Wisconsin counties.<ref>Wisconsin DNR Division of Forestry, Annual Report 2012 p. 6</ref><ref>WI DNR https://forestrynews.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/12/03/new-northern-oak-wilt-detections/</ref> These 2011 infections have serious ecological/economic impacts, including loss of stumpage and real estate values, and will only get worse if summer (aerial with ground follow up) surveys aren't established as soon as possible.\n\n\n==Host-Parasite Interaction==\n\nHardwood vascular wilt diseases are characterized by blockage of the tree's water-conducting vessels by either the physical presence of the pathogen (mycelium and spores), or through the host's own response to infection. Oak trees, in response to wounding or infection often produce [[tylosis (botany)|tyloses]], balloon-like outgrowths of the vessels' cell walls that can function to wall-off pathogens and prevent infections from spreading. Red oaks appear to lack a host-response mechanism that restricts the pathogen's movement, and infection usually kills the tree by wilting the entire crown. White oaks, which produce [[tyloses]] more quickly and in greater numbers, are more resistant to the disease, though the exact mechanism for this resistance is unknown.\n\n==Origin==\n\nThe causal agent, ''Bretziella fagacearum'', is found only within the borders of the United States, but the origin of the pathogen is not known. Recent evidence suggests that the pathogen was introduced into the United States, possibly from [[Central America|Central]] or [[South America]], or [[Mexico]].<ref>Juzwik, J.; Harrington, T.C.; MacDonald, W.L.; Appel, D.N. (2008), \"The origin of Ceratocystis fagacearum, the oak wilt fungus\", \"Annual Review of Phytopathology\",46: 13-26,</ref> The disease currently affects much of the eastern and central US, from [[Virginia]] to [[Minnesota]] to [[Arkansas]], with pockets of infection as far southwestward as the Hill Country of central [[Texas]]. One area of infection has recently been discovered as far northeastward as [[Glenville, New York|Glenville]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is particularly common in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].\n\n==See also==\n\n=== Mortality of oaks ===\n* [[Japanese oak wilt]] - caused by ''Raffaelea quercivora'' in Japan\n* [[Sudden oak death]] - caused by ''Phytophthora ramorum''\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/fidls/oakwilt/oakwilt.htm USDA Forest Service article]\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/howtos/ht_oakwilt/toc.htm USDA \"How to prevent Oak Wilt\"]\n* [http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/naturalresources/DD3174.html Oak Wilt in Minnesota]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1991788}}\n\n<!-- [[Category:Sordariomycetes]] moved to species Latin name redirect-->\n[[Category:Parasitic fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungal tree pathogens and diseases]]\n[[Category:Quercus]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Central America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of South America]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox plant disease\n| name             = Oak wilt\n| image            = Oak wilt aerial photo.jpg\n| caption          = Aerial photograph of an oak wilt center (St. Paul, MN).

Symptoms vary by tree species but generally consist of leaf discoloration, wilt, defoliation, and death. The fungus spreads from diseased to healthy trees overland by insect or other airborne vectors and underground by naturally grafted tree roots. Management of the disease historically meant preventing infection by not wounding oaks during certain time periods, removing diseased oaks that will produce spores (sanitation), and breaking root connections with vibratory plows, trenchers, rock saws or hoes. Present methods focus on reducing or eliminating monocultures and restoring ecosystems correctly using soils baseline information. Fungicides are used for preventive treatments in urban areas. Oak wilt poses a danger for oak wood products and shade trees in urban areas.\n\n==Hosts and symptoms==\n[[File:Oak wilt symptoms.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of oak wilt symptoms|Photograph of leaf and whole tree symptoms of oak wilt in a red oak tree. Joseph O'Brien, USDA Forest Service, Bugwood.org]]\n\nOak wilt is one of three devastating North American vascular wilt diseases and was first seen in Wisconsin in the 1940s.  Within the last decade, it has spread into new counties in northern Wisconsin, counties northwest and northeast of the Twin Cities in Minnesota and also new locations in northeastern states.  The other two vascular wilts and their destructive time periods are [[chestnut blight]] (1900-1950) and [[Dutch elm disease]] (1928 - 1980).\n\nVascular wilts, including oak wilt, kill by fooling the tree into killing itself; the fungus or pathogen does not kill the tree or host.  The tree's reaction-to fungus entering into sapwood, by walling off the fungus, causes shutdown of water supply upward, then wilting, thus killing off the fungus doesn't eradicate the problem, keeping the water supply open and flowing upward is the main problem.  Certain elements like Boron are crucial to the trees' physiological well being, especially with translocation of fluids.  Additionally, copper and chemotherapies have been used to keep the tree or plant from killing itself via wilting[http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=EY7524088].\n\nOak wilt infects and kills all oak species but affects the two main groups, [[red oak|red]] and [[white oak]]s, differently. Mostly, red oak group trees die faster from oak wilt disease than white oak group trees. Oaks in North and Central America are sorted into two groups based mostly upon the porosity and corresponding leaf shape. The white oak group have rounded leaf edges and pores, also known as xylem or sapwood, are clogged with [[tylosis (botany)|tyloses]]. The red oak group have pointed leaf edges and pores are large and open.\n \nCommon names of oaks are based upon folklore or customs, which leads-to black oaks being in the red oak group. In the upper midwest, red oak group trees like black, northern red and northern pin are most threatened by oak wilt for two reasons: they die faster and they produce spore mats, known also as spore pads or pressure pads.  Spore mats are the fruiting bodies of the oak wilt fungus and, when ripening or sporulating, can spread disease overland.   Overland spread of oak wilt from white oaks is not a problem because white oak group trees rarely produce spore mats. When infected, oaks in the red oak group die over the course of a single summer. These oaks typically die from the top of the tree down as leaves become a bronze color and fall off the tree.  Another symptom is discoloration of the vascular tissues. Brown streaks or spots can be seen under the bark in the sapwood; oak wilt specialists call this stage II.[[File:Oak_Wilt_Dropped_Leaves_Polk_County_WI_Noon_July_14,_2016.png|thumb|right|Sudden leaf drop July red oak]]\n\nOaks in the white oak group, [[Quercus alba|white]], [[Quercus bicolor|swamp white]], and [[Quercus macrocarpa|bur]], die slower when infected (white oak in particular) and can live for several years after infection, losing a few branches each season from the top down. Bur oaks tend to die faster than others in the white oak group, although not as fast as trees in the red oak group. Symptoms in white oak are similar to those in red oak. Quercus virginiana, the southern live oak, is the most common of 31 species of evergreen oaks and is in the white oak group.\n\nOaks with oak wilt stand out with their dead crowns compared to a green canopy in the summer, so much so that oak wilt infections can be spotted from the air.\n\nNorthern pin oak (''Q. ellipsoidalis'') infection and spread are extreme when monocultures exist. Northern pin oak forests are typically found on entisol soils (aka barren, river terrace or lakebed sands) in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and these forest ecosystems are often misidentified as oak savannas, which are prairie - not forest - ecosystems. Mistaking northern pin oak forest monocultures for oak savannas, then burning them for oak savanna restoration, has made state and federal lands north of Minneapolis-St Paul the largest oak wilt disease reservoirs in Minnesota.<ref>Nelson, Steven (2011). ''Savanna Soils of Minnesota.'' Minnesota: Self. pp. 21-22,29-30. {{ISBN|978-0-615-50320-2}}.</ref>\n\nWilt and death in [[Live oak]] usually occurs within six months of infection. Live oak foliar symptoms differ from those of red and white oak. Infected live oak leaves develop yellow colored veins then eventually die and turn brown before falling off the tree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.texasoakwilt.org/Documents/Stewardship/OakWilt_English.pdf |title=How to identify and manage oak wilt in Texas |date= June 2003 |website=Texasokwilt.org |publisher=USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station |access-date= June 12, 2017 |quote=Leaves on diseased live oaks often develop chlorotic (yellow colored) veins that eventually die / turn brown}}</ref>\n\n==Disease Cycle==\n[[File:Oak Wilt cycle.gif|thumb|alt=Illustration of the oak wilt disease cycle|Illustration of the oak wilt disease cycle by Julie Martinez]]\n\n[[File:Ceratocystis fagacearum endoconidia.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Ceratocystis fagacearum endoconidia|Photograph of spores produced by the oak wilt fungus. (a) Endoconidia (b) Conidiophore]]\n\nThe oak wilt fungus spreads in two basic ways: transfer of spores from diseased to healthy trees overland by insect and other vectors and movement underground of the fungus from a diseased tree to a healthy tree through [[grafting|root grafts]]. [[File:Root Graft.png|thumb|left|Root Graft of hardwood tree after excavation following vibratory plowing]] \n====Overland====\nSpores are the seeds of a fungus.  If conditions - temperature, moisture content, wood pH - are right after the oak has wilted and died, spore mats form under the bark of the tree. [[File:Spore_Mats_Car_Keys_May_2015.jpg|thumb|left|Bark removed by squirrels attracted-to fruity odor. Spore mats stage III]]\n\nSpore mats produce asexual spores called endoconidia, which are barrel shaped and produced in chains.  [[File:The Real Dr Spore Mat.jpg|thumb|right|Wood caramel colored, spore mats stage III]]Conidia are often dispersed by air and rain and also by insects and other agents.<ref>K\u00e4\u00e4rik, A. (1983).\"Atlas of Airborne Fungal Spores in Europe\". Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer-Verlag. p. 7 {{ISBN|3-540-11900-0}}.</ref> If compatible mating types are present, these mats will also produce sexual spores called ascospores in fruiting structures called perithecia.  Ascospores are spread by water, insects and other agents.<ref>K\u00e4\u00e4rik, A. (1983).\"Atlas of Airborne Fungal Spores in Europe\". Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer-Verlag. p. 7 {{ISBN|3-540-11900-0}}.</ref>    \nCertain species of [[Nitidulidae|sap beetles]] plus other insects, birds and animals are attracted to the fruity smell of oak wilt spore mats. \n\nSpore mats/pressure pads increase in size, eventually breaking the bark covering them, which sends the spores' fruity odor out into the area, attracting sap beetles and other insects, birds and animals, like squirrels. The oak wilt disease \"selling\" business is now open. [[File:SpMatClose.jpg|thumb|left|Spore Mat stage III meaning infectious]]One example of overland spread is sap beetles picking-up spores from diseased red oaks then depositing them onto fresh wounds made on healthy oaks.  The oak wilt \"buying\" business is now open...for 2 days only.  New infections in areas with no history of oak wilt occur by this overland transmission route.[[File:Spore_Mats_Stage_IV-V.jpg|thumb|right|Spore mats (dark patches) stage IV - V are no longer infectious]]  However, not all all red oaks that died in one year produce spores/sporulate the next year between April and July. Small red oaks 6 - 10 inch dbh tend to sporulate the autumn of the year they got infected, or not at all; small trees, once dead, dry out faster than large trees and oak wilt fungus cannot survive in that dry environment.  Roughly 15 to 30 percent of red oaks greater than 10 inch dbh will sporulate April - July the year following infection.  The other 70 - 85 percent of infected red oaks will sporulate, either before April or after July the following year or, not at all, because wood rotting fungi (Trichoderma) is already in the oak and out-competes/kills the oak wilt fungus.\n====Underground====\nOak wilt moves from diseased trees to healthy trees through roots that have become interconnected (root [[grafting|grafts]]). \nTransmission via root grafts is the most common means of spread, and makes up more than 85 % of new infections every year.  Oaks within 50 - 150 feet (15 - 50 meters) of a diseased oak can be infected via root graft transmission.  In this case, spores (also endoconidia) produced inside the tree travel upward through vascular tissue in the wood, known as the xylem.  Most root grafts form between oaks of the same species and of the same generation; it's rare for a 60 year old oak to root graft with a 15 year old oak of same species.  Red oak roots graft more commonly than do white oak roots, and grafts between red and white oaks are very rare.\n\n==Environment==\nIn the Midwest and eastern United States, conditions are usually favorable for spore production and beetle activity during spring and early summer.  In Texas, mat formation is most common in late fall and winter. Frequency of root graft formation, and therefore root graft transmission, is affected by soil type and stand composition (diversity of tree species). See disease cycle and management sections for details.\n\n==Management==\nLandowners and managers have to remember that oaks love light and heat more than other forest tree species; they are one of the few tree species that survive in the prairie regions.  Releasing or thinning oaks from competition, which gives remaining oaks more light, moisture and nutrients, should always be the primary goal, whether or not oak wilt is present.  Oak wilt is similar to [[Dutch elm disease]] but more controllable. Beetles carrying oak wilt do not have chewing mouth parts, and need some other creature or physical damage to wound the tree, whereas beetles that carry Dutch elm disease do have chewing mouth parts. Prevention is essential, as there is no permanent cure. To prevent overland spread, oaks should not be wounded, including [[pruning|pruned]], in the [[spring (season)|spring]] months in the east and Midwest or February through June in Texas. Care should be taken to prevent injury to oaks during this period, particularly during construction activities. Painting wounds less than 48 hours old is advised if oaks are wounded in the spring by wind or human caused damage. Painting wounds more than 48 hours old is not helpful because the oak by that time has compartmentalized (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CODIT) the injury/wound.  Reducing the source of spores is helpful. When a dead red oak has not sporulated - hasn't reached stage III yet - before the following spring, it should be chipped or mulched onsite, then burned at a CHP (combined heat & power) plant.  If that is not possible, wood greater than 5\" diameter can be split into firewood size pieces then left onsite to dry before spring, or covered with plastic sheeting to effect composting. Heat from composting should destroy the fungus. Logs or firewood from red oak group trees that have died of oak wilt should never be moved to unaffected areas.\n\n====Root Graft or Overland Infection?====\nThe first oak in any infection center is always infected from overland spread; additional oaks killed from the disease in that infection center are killed from underground root graft spread.  Before control plans are made, the landowner or land manager (forester, arborist) needs to find out how the infection got there and what type (underground, overland or both) it is.  Root graft infections move slowly, so additional root graft infections may not be seen for 1-3 years.  It is impossible for one oak infected via overland to infect & wilt seventeen additional oaks via root graft transmission, in less than 4 months (see Kerrick, Minnesota oak wilt photo, below).  If one sees more than half dozen oaks wilting during one summer in a new infection with healthy oaks in between means infections started from overland route/storm event, not underground.  In that case, each wilting oak is a separate infection center, not part of one infection center.  One should also look at the site to confirm whether or not it's an overland infection.  Overland infections occur on or near hilltops or other exposed areas, where taller oaks get wounded, then infected, and shorter oaks look healthy.  A spread pattern with no obvious direction usually means multiple airborne/overland infections.  Root graft infections can \"fan\" out in 360 degree pattern, but tend to head faster in one or two directions because of soil and topography changes and tree species arrangement/diversity. [[File:Kost_Oak_Savanna_OW_cleanup_autumn_2007.jpg|thumb|left|Oak wilt and buckthorn cleanup on oak savanna in Chisago County, Minnesota autumn/after leaf drop 2007]]  A birds-eye view of an infection center, during the middle of summer, going from oldest to newest based on colors would show: stone dead gray, brown, yellow, orange, green.  So, if one doesn't see these color sequences or, a hub and spoke pattern radiating out, they are probably looking at multiple airborne infections.  Looks can be deceiving because 2-6 large wilting oaks may often have only 1-2 trees left nearby to infect.  Compared-to one oak deep in the woods that is just starting to wilt that can lead-to 2-5 dozen more nearby oaks dying in the next 5 years.  So, proper ground ID & diagnosis is crucial for stopping this disease.  Stopping spread with multiple infections means plowlines will be further out, so natural barriers should be located first.  In the Lake States, a vibratory plow line is installed 54 to 72 inches deep in the ground and 60 - 150 feet away from the diseased oak.  Plowing done correctly ruptures healthy roots that could, in the future, transmit oak wilt to neighboring healthy trees.  Installing plow lines far enough away from diseased oaks is key to preventing root graft disease transmission.  In southern states like Texas, where heavy clay or Caliche soils are prevalent, rocksaws are commonly used in lieu of vibratory plows.  Infected oaks should not be cut down before vibratory plowing because, doing so will speed up oak wilt root graft spread to nearby healthy oaks.  Base of trunk or root flare injections of azole or copper based fungicides can help contain foliar - or top down - infections but are costly and have less success containing root graft - bottom up - transmission of oak wilt.\n\n\n====Strategies - Containment vs. Control====\nThere is a big difference between containment and control.  Containment happens within a few hours or days; control takes weeks or many months.  The lack of appreciation and understanding for disease control methods and strategies has led to a lot of landowners and taxpayers thinking there is no way to control oak wilt.  Despite 40-50 years of work & study showing oak wilt as one of the easiest to control forest diseases in North America.  Putting a plowline around an oak wilt infection center is containment, which is not controlling the disease.  Going inside the containment lines or natural barriers/edges/cover type changes and making sure all oak wilt infections are dead and gone is control.  Landowners and managers have to ask themselves this question (are we going to be containing or controlling this disease?) before starting a disease control project, whether in a small yard or on hundreds of acres.  Control also means removal and processing - mostly by logging - of future spore-producing oaks.  For the last 40-50 years, experienced professionals throughout North America have been doing insect & disease control year round, not four or six months per year.  They stop oak wilt spread by identifying future spore producing red oaks, which trees to protect from wounding, which trees not threatened by root graft infection then, respond same day to tree health changes.  Agriculture and construction work starts in April-May each year, so it behooves oak wilt specialists to continue disease control work and prevention right through spring and early summer.\n[[File:White_Oak_on_Nymore_soils_Chisago_County_2012.jpg|thumb|right|Healthy white oak (Q. alba) remaining after cleaning up 7-1-11 storm damage & oak wilt infections, 13 months after storm, 2012, Chisago County Minnesota]]\nAfter 2005, treatment goals shifted towards \"passive oak wilt control\" on properties less than 5 acres and treating to natural barriers or edges for large acreages. Passive control means letting the disease burn out over a few years which allows other native tree and shrub species to take over. Treating to natural barriers means restoring to native forest or savanna species by harvesting out to where oak wilt can no longer expand via root grafts. All oaks of the species that is infected are logged out, whether they are infected or healthy. Passive oak wilt control on large acreages creates short and long term problems for oaks. White oak group trees are at risk for infection from nearby sporulating red oak group trees for the short term; invasive species can take over and monocultures of oaks can re-develop that sustain oak wilt infections for 50-100 more years making for long term risks. Treating to natural barriers/edges or cover type changes is by far the best method to use when controlling oak wilt on large acreages.\n\n==Importance==\n\nOak wilt is a devastating disease, killing trees rapidly in a single season. It is an important disease in urban areas where a few oak trees in a homeowner's yard may be of great value. If one tree in the homeowners yard becomes infected it will die. Not only will the homeowner need to pay to remove the dead tree, they will also need to protect the rest of the oak trees in their yard or face the prospect that remaining oaks will continue to die. Loss of trees from a property can also lead to a decrease in property value. Even if a homeowner is vigilant about pruning at the correct time, storms and construction can damage trees and introduce oak wilt into a neighborhood.  In forest systems, oak wilt is an important disease of oak produced for hardwood lumber and railroad ties.\n\n===July 1, 2011 Windstorm in Minnesota and Wisconsin===\n\n[[File:Kerrick_Oak_Wilt_8-19-16_Spawned-_from_7-1-2011_Infection_Centers.png|thumb|left|North Flank of 7-1-2011 Windstorm went thru northern Pine and Carlton Counties Minnesota.

The infections appeared to have coincided-with the July 1, 2011 mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) windstorm,<ref>NWS NOAA https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Storm_1_01July2011_SW_to_NE.pdf</ref> which had windspeeds of over 100&nbsp;mph, because foresters found that first oaks infected were 7-1-11 storm-damaged oaks. \nThey also knew infections happened within 48 hours of storm damage. West-facing slopes on the east bank (Wisconsin side) and terrace crests in the St. Croix river valley were hit hard with wind damage and oak wilt infections.  Hilltops and bottoms and field edges, where oaks were more exposed, also had more serious wind and oak wilt damage.  Approximately 3/4 million acres in Minnesota, possibly 10 times that area for Wisconsin<ref>WI DNR https://forestrynews.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/12/03/new-northern-oak-wilt-detections/</ref> and up to the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, were affected by the storm. Millions of freshly wounded oak trees were now open to infection from trillions of oak wilt spores carried-in by the storm.\n\n====Infection Levels-Spore Loads====\nIt's difficult for oaks to get infected in mid summer - after July 1 - because it's too hot for red oaks to sporulate and latewood cell development has been underway since early to mid-June. Two factors changed this around on July 1, 2011: the trillions of oak wilt spores carried-in from west-southwest and the windstorm's tearing/shredding/breaking-apart trees which re-opened oaks' 2011 & 2010 earlywood cells (earlywood is also called ''springwood'', and latewood goes by the name ''summerwood'' in some areas). The oak wilt fungus is too big to fit within the smaller latewood cells, but can fit within and move upward through the much larger earlywood cells. This storm damage increased the chances of infection 1,000 - 1,000,000 times the usual. Instead of one new infection per 1,500 acres, foresters were seeing one new infection per 10 acres. The manageable level of oak wilt disease is one infection per 640 acres.[[File:Oak_Wilt_Infection_Center_in_2013_Created_7-1-2011_Rushseba_Township,_Chisago_County,_Minnesota.jpg|thumb|right|7-1-2011 storm-caused oak wilt on terrace crest in Rushsheba Township, Chisago County, Minnesota]][[File:East_Farmington_3_Infection_Centers_photo_taken_8-8-16.png|thumb|left|South Flank of 7-1-2011 Windstorm went thru St. Croix County, Wisconsin.  Photo shows one of five 7-1-11 infection centers on hilltop near East Farmington, Wisconsin]]\nOne year after the storm, in summer 2012, oak wilt specialists found 10 - 20 infections per 100 acres both in Rushseba Township, Chisago County Minnesota and at St. Croix State Park<ref>Minnesota DNR Forestry 2012 Forest Health Annual Report, p. 37</ref>  in Pine County, Minnesota. \nWounding & infecting at ten oaks per 100 acres, one oak per 100 acres or one oak per 200 acres presents a serious threat to the oak resource. St. Croix State Park's northern-most infected oak and southern-most infected oak were 10 miles apart. This broad coverage of oak wilt blanketing millions of acres is achieved only with huge spore supplies and re-opening of that years' earlywood cells.\n====Detection====\nThe use of spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging show promise for accurate detection of the disease <ref> Fallon, et al. 2020 Fallon, B., A. Yang, C. Lapadat, I. Armour, J. Juzwik, R. A. Montgomery, and J. Cavender-Bares. 2020.

Tree Physiology 40:377-390.\nhttps://academic.oup.com/treephys/article/40/3/377/5728678 </ref> and are currently being tested for large scale detection and monitoring.\n\n====Sources====\nSources with that many hundreds of acres of oak wilt spores were upwind  (240 degrees/west southwest) in the three oak wilt \"reservoirs\" on state and federal lands in Sherburne, Anoka, Isanti and Chisago counties of Minnesota (see Hosts and Symptoms). The sources of oak wilt spores were not nearby.\n\n====Rate of Spread====\nBefore the windstorm, oak wilt could spread north at three quarters of a mile per year and east or west at one and one half miles per year.<ref>Minnesota DNR Forestry (2001).</ref>  During the storm, oak wilt spread at up to 100 miles per hour. In the two years following the 2011 storm, infections were found at new locations in four Minnesota and at least one (Sawyer) of three Wisconsin counties.<ref>Wisconsin DNR Division of Forestry, Annual Report 2012 p. 6</ref><ref>WI DNR https://forestrynews.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/12/03/new-northern-oak-wilt-detections/</ref> These 2011 infections have serious ecological/economic impacts, including loss of stumpage and real estate values, and will only get worse if summer (aerial with ground follow up) surveys aren't established as soon as possible.\n\n\n==Host-Parasite Interaction==\n\nHardwood vascular wilt diseases are characterized by blockage of the tree's water-conducting vessels by either the physical presence of the pathogen (mycelium and spores), or through the host's own response to infection. Oak trees, in response to wounding or infection often produce [[tylosis (botany)|tyloses]], balloon-like outgrowths of the vessels' cell walls that can function to wall-off pathogens and prevent infections from spreading. Red oaks appear to lack a host-response mechanism that restricts the pathogen's movement, and infection usually kills the tree by wilting the entire crown. White oaks, which produce [[tyloses]] more quickly and in greater numbers, are more resistant to the disease, though the exact mechanism for this resistance is unknown.\n\n==Origin==\n\nThe causal agent, ''Bretziella fagacearum'', is found only within the borders of the United States, but the origin of the pathogen is not known. Recent evidence suggests that the pathogen was introduced into the United States, possibly from [[Central America|Central]] or [[South America]], or [[Mexico]].<ref>Juzwik, J.; Harrington, T.C.; MacDonald, W.L.; Appel, D.N. (2008), \"The origin of Ceratocystis fagacearum, the oak wilt fungus\", \"Annual Review of Phytopathology\",46: 13-26,</ref> The disease currently affects much of the eastern and central US, from [[Virginia]] to [[Minnesota]] to [[Arkansas]], with pockets of infection as far southwestward as the Hill Country of central [[Texas]]. One area of infection has recently been discovered as far northeastward as [[Glenville, New York|Glenville]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is particularly common in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].\n\n==See also==\n\n=== Mortality of oaks ===\n* [[Japanese oak wilt]] - caused by ''Raffaelea quercivora'' in Japan\n* [[Sudden oak death]] - caused by ''Phytophthora ramorum''\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/fidls/oakwilt/oakwilt.htm USDA Forest Service article]\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/howtos/ht_oakwilt/toc.htm USDA \"How to prevent Oak Wilt\"]\n* [http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/naturalresources/DD3174.html Oak Wilt in Minnesota]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1991788}}\n\n<!-- [[Category:Sordariomycetes]] moved to species Latin name redirect-->\n[[Category:Parasitic fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungal tree pathogens and diseases]]\n[[Category:Quercus]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Central America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of South America]]\n", "name_user": "Cavender.bares", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_wilt"}

Changes in the cost of living over time are often operationalized in a [[cost-of-living index]]. Cost of living volatile explosion sulphate manganese calculations are also used to compare the cost of maintaining a certain standard of living in different geographic areas.  Differences in cost of living between locations can also be measured in terms of [[purchasing power parity]] rates.\n\n==Cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)==\nEmployment contracts and pension benefits can be tied to a cost-of-living index, typically to the [[consumer price index]] (CPI). A COLA adjusts salaries based on changes in a cost-of-living index. Salaries are typically adjusted annually. They may also be tied to a cost-of-living index that varies by geographic location if the employee moves. In this later case, the expatriate employee will likely see only the [[disposable income|discretionary income]] part of their salary indexed by a differential CPI between the new and old employment locations, leaving the non-discretionary part of the salary (e.g., mortgage payments, insurance, car payments) unmodified.\n\nAnnual escalation clauses in employment contracts can specify retroactive or future percentage increases in worker pay which are not tied to any index. These negotiated increases in pay are colloquially referred to as cost-of-living adjustments or cost-of-living increases because of their similarity to increases tied to externally determined indexes. Cost-of-living allowance is equal to the nominal interest minus the real interest rate.\n\n== Consumer Price Index (CPI) ==\nWhen cost-of-living adjustments, negotiated wage settlements and budgetary increases exceed ''CPI'', media reports frequently compare the two without consideration of the pertinent tax code. However, CPI is based on the retail pricing of a [[Market basket|basket]] of goods and services. Most purchases of that same basket require the use of after-tax dollars\u2014dollars that were often subject to the highest ''marginal tax rate''. Consequently, the COLA will necessarily have to exceed the CPI inflation rate to maintain purchasing power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/cpi/|title=CPI Home : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\nThe widely recognized problem known as [[Fiscal drag|bracket-creep]] can also occur in countries where the marginal tax brackets themselves are not indexed \u2014 COLA increases simply place more dollars into higher tax rate brackets.
