Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. \"Self-abuse,\" as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth & Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as \"bad\" or \"wrong.\" In an age when people are urged to practice \"[[safer sex]],\" masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}</ref><ref name=\"Sigel2004\">{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|series= |issue=4|pages=1065\u20131066|issn=0022-4529|accessdate=|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

The implications were clear: if most people masturbated and did not experience insanity, debility, and early death, then masturbation could not be held accountable to the etiology that had been assigned it.

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. \"Self-abuse,\" as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth & Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as \"bad\" or \"wrong.\" In an age when people are urged to practice \"[[safer sex]],\" masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}</ref><ref name=\"Sigel2004\">{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|series= |issue=4|pages=1065\u20131066|issn=0022-4529|accessdate=|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

The implications were clear: if most people masturbated and did not experience insanity, debility, and early death, then masturbation could not be held accountable to the etiology that had been assigned it.

Produced in commemoration of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series' 25th anniversary, ''Sonic Mania'' homages the original [[Sega Genesis]] ''Sonic'' games, featuring speedy [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] gameplay. It takes place over twelve [[Level (video gaming)|levels]], including eight redesigned stages from past games. The story follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] and his companions [[Tails (character)|Tails]] and [[Knuckles the Echidna|Knuckles]] as they venture to defeat their nemesis [[Doctor Eggman]] and his robotic henchmen, the Hard-Boiled Heavies.\n\nThe development team was composed of members known for their work in the ''Sonic'' [[fangame]] and [[ROM hacking]] community. Development began after lead developer [[Christian \"Taxman\" Whitehead]], who was previously contracted by Sega to develop enhanced mobile ports of Genesis ''Sonic'' games, presented a playable prototype to [[Sonic Team]] producer [[Takashi Iizuka (game designer)|Takashi Iizuka]]. Art, level design, audio, and additional programming was provided by independent studios PagodaWest Games and Headcannon. The team used Whitehead's [[Retro Engine]] and aimed for a graphical quality between Genesis and [[Sega Saturn]] games.\n\n''Sonic Mania'' was released in August 2017. Many reviewers saw it as a return to form for the ''Sonic'' series following a number of poorly received games released after the 1990s;<!--Do not change this as it does not imply that EVERY Sonic game released since the 1990s has been poorly-received. Thank you.--> its presentation, level design, music, and faithfulness to the early ''Sonic'' games were praised, but its lack of originality was criticized. Several described it as one of the best ''Sonic'' games and one of the best games of 2017.

However, Dr. Robotnik sends an elite group of EggRobos to reach the signal before Sonic and Tails. The EggRobos excavate the source of the signal, a magical gemstone called the Phantom Ruby, just as Sonic and Tails arrive. The EggRobos gain new powers from the ruby, becoming the Hard Boiled Heavies, and send Sonic, Tails, and the island's guardian, Knuckles, through zones they have previously visited where they pursue Robotnik to prevent him from using the ruby's power for evil, clashing with him and the Heavies along the way.\n\nSonic and his allies discover that Robotnik has used the Phantom Ruby's power to retake control of Little Planet from ''Sonic CD''. They board Robotnik's robotic fortress, defeat him and the Heavies, and escape just as it explodes. If all 7 Chaos Emeralds are collected while playing as Sonic, the Phantom Ruby transports him and Robotnik to another dimension. There, the Heavy King betrays Robotnik and takes the ruby, imbuing himself with power; Robotnik attacks the Heavy to try to reclaim it. Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic and fights Robotnik and the Heavy King separately to keep the ruby out of the possession of both. After the battle, the Phantom Ruby reacts with the Emeralds, negating Sonic's super state and creating a wormhole that engulfs itself and Sonic as Little Planet vanishes.<!--DO NOT LINK TO SONIC FORCES HERE.

Produced in commemoration of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series' 25th anniversary, ''Sonic Mania'' homages the original [[Sega Genesis]] ''Sonic'' games, featuring speedy [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] gameplay. It takes place over twelve [[Level (video gaming)|levels]], including eight redesigned stages from past games. The story follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] and his companions [[Tails (character)|Tails]] and [[Knuckles the Echidna|Knuckles]] as they venture to defeat their nemesis [[Doctor Eggman]] and his robotic henchmen, the Hard-Boiled Heavies.\n\nThe development team was composed of members known for their work in the ''Sonic'' [[fangame]] and [[ROM hacking]] community. Development began after lead developer [[Christian \"Taxman\" Whitehead]], who was previously contracted by Sega to develop enhanced mobile ports of Genesis ''Sonic'' games, presented a playable prototype to [[Sonic Team]] producer [[Takashi Iizuka (game designer)|Takashi Iizuka]]. Art, level design, audio, and additional programming was provided by independent studios PagodaWest Games and Headcannon. The team used Whitehead's [[Retro Engine]] and aimed for a graphical quality between Genesis and [[Sega Saturn]] games.\n\n''Sonic Mania'' was released in August 2017. Many reviewers saw it as a return to form for the ''Sonic'' series following a number of poorly received games released after the 1990s;<!--Do not change this as it does not imply that EVERY Sonic game released since the 1990s has been poorly-received. Thank you.--> its presentation, level design, music, and faithfulness to the early ''Sonic'' games were praised, but its lack of originality was criticized. Several described it as one of the best ''Sonic'' games and one of the best games of 2017. Within a year, it had sold over one million copies worldwide across all platforms. ''Sonic Mania Plus'', an enhanced version with additional content, was released in July 2018.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Sonic Mania Studiopolis screenshot.png|thumb|left|alt=Sonic, a cartoonish blue hedgehog with red shoes, runs at high speeds and breaks windows in Studiopolis Zone, one of the levels in Sonic Mania.|Gameplay screenshot showing Sonic in Studiopolis Zone, the first of the four original levels in ''Sonic Mania''.]]\n\n''Sonic Mania'' is a [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]] similar to the early ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' games released for the [[Sega Genesis]].

However, Dr. Robotnik sends an elite group of EggRobos to reach the signal before Sonic and Tails. The EggRobos excavate the source of the signal, a magical gemstone called the Phantom Ruby, just as Sonic and Tails arrive. The EggRobos gain new powers from the ruby, becoming the Hard Boiled Heavies, and send Sonic, Tails, and the island's guardian, Knuckles, through zones they have previously visited where they pursue Robotnik to prevent him from using the ruby's power for evil, clashing with him and the Heavies along the way.\n\nSonic and his allies discover that Robotnik has used the Phantom Ruby's power to retake control of Little Planet from ''Sonic CD''. They board Robotnik's robotic fortress, defeat him and the Heavies, and escape just as it explodes. If all 7 Chaos Emeralds are collected while playing as Sonic, the Phantom Ruby transports him and Robotnik to another dimension. There, the Heavy King betrays Robotnik and takes the ruby, imbuing himself with power; Robotnik attacks the Heavy to try to reclaim it. Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic and fights Robotnik and the Heavy King separately to keep the ruby out of the possession of both. After the battle, the Phantom Ruby reacts with the Emeralds, negating Sonic's super state and creating a wormhole that engulfs itself and Sonic as Little Planet vanishes.<!--DO NOT LINK TO SONIC FORCES HERE.
