Cisco made its first [[Takeover|acquisition]] in 1993,<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=April 16, 2008|url=http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac49/ac20/downloads/annualreport/ar2004/pdf/ar_2004_editorial.pdf|title=A Communications Revolution |publisher=[[Cisco Systems]]}}</ref> which was followed by a series of further acquisitions.\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1987, Cisco did not acquire a company during the first seven years of its existence; but, on September 24, 1993, Cisco acquired [[Crescendo Communications]], a [[LAN switching]] company.<ref name=\"crescendo 2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_03/b3766006.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020116065334/http://businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_03/b3766006.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 16, 2002|title=Cisco Shopped till It Nearly Dropped|publisher=[[BusinessWeek]]|accessdate=April 28, 2008}}</ref> Following the first Cisco takeover purchase, acquisitions have constituted 50 percent of the company's business activity.<ref name=\"crescendo 2\" />\n\nThe company's largest acquisition {{as of|2008|4|lc=on}} is the purchase of [[Scientific-Atlanta]]\u2014a manufacturer of [[cable television]], [[telecommunications]] and [[broadband]] equipment\u2014for [[United States dollar|US$]]6.9 billion. The purchase represented the interest that Cisco had in Internet television, as spending on switches and routers decreased, and expanded the corporation's consumer product base after its prior acquisition of Linksys Inc., a producer of wireless networking products for homes and small businesses. Cisco [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) at the time, John Chambers, described it as a \"medium-sized\" purchase, but the acquisition was the largest since Cisco paid US$7.29 billion for Cerent Corporation in 1999. The deal was announced in November 2005 and was finalized in early 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cisco Agrees to Buy Scientific-Atlanta for $6.9 Bln (Update8)|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awnLzqzOM2A8&refer=us|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113150619/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awnLzqzOM2A8&refer=us|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 13, 2015|accessdate=May 24, 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=November 18, 2005|author=Rebecca Barr}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of companies acquired by Cisco are based in the United States (U.S.) and a total of 149 companies have been acquired {{as of|2011|3|lc=on}}.<ref name=\"Acquisitions by Year\">{{cite web |title=Acquisitions by Year |url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/corporate-strategy-office/acquisitions/acquisitions-list-years.html |website=www.cisco.com |accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref> Most of the companies acquired by Cisco are related to computer networking, with several LAN switching and [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) companies included in the list of acquisitions.<ref name=\"Acquisitions by Year\"/>\n\n==Acquisitions==\nEach acquisition is for the respective company in its entirety, unless otherwise specified, and the date of the agreement between Cisco Systems and the subject of the acquisition is listed. The value of each acquisition is listed in the US$ currency because Cisco Systems is headquartered in [[California]], U.S.\n\nMost of the products and business comes through acquisition. Cisco Systems has spent more than 70 billion dollars for acquisition.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Date\n! Company\n! Business\n! Country\n!

The purchase represented the interest that Cisco had in Internet television, as spending on switches and routers decreased, and expanded the corporation's consumer product base after its prior acquisition of Linksys Inc., a producer of wireless networking products for homes and small businesses. Cisco [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) at the time, John Chambers, described it as a \"medium-sized\" purchase, but the acquisition was the largest since Cisco paid US$7.29 billion for Cerent Corporation in 1999. The deal was announced in November 2005 and was finalized in early 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cisco Agrees to Buy Scientific-Atlanta for $6.9 Bln (Update8)|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awnLzqzOM2A8&refer=us|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113150619/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awnLzqzOM2A8&refer=us|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 13, 2015|accessdate=May 24, 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=November 18, 2005|author=Rebecca Barr}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of companies acquired by Cisco are based in the United States (U.S.) and a total of 149 companies have been acquired {{as of|2011|3|lc=on}}.<ref name=\"Acquisitions by Year\">{{cite web |title=Acquisitions by Year |url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/corporate-strategy-office/acquisitions/acquisitions-list-years.html |website=www.cisco.com |accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref> Most of the companies acquired by Cisco are related to computer networking, with several LAN switching and [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) companies included in the list of acquisitions.<ref name=\"Acquisitions by Year\"/>\n\n==Acquisitions==\nEach acquisition is for the respective company in its entirety, unless otherwise specified, and the date of the agreement between Cisco Systems and the subject of the acquisition is listed.

It lists the 40 most-played songs on [[alternative music|alternative]] and [[modern rock]] radio stations. The chart was introduced as a companion to the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart and its creation was prompted by the explosion of alternative music on American radio in the late 1980s. During the first several years of the chart, it regularly featured music that did not receive commercial radio airplay anywhere but on a few modern rock and college rock radio stations. This included many [[electronica|electronic]] and [[post-punk]] artists. Gradually, as alternative rock became more \"mainstream\" (particularly spearheaded by the [[grunge]] explosion in the early 1990s), the Alternative Songs and Mainstream Rock Songs charts began featuring more of the same songs. However, the formats would differentiate themselves by the late 2000s. Today, the Alternative Songs chart favors more [[indie rock]], [[indie pop]], and [[synth-pop]] bands while the Mainstream Rock chart favors more [[alternative rock]], [[hard rock]], and [[heavy metal music]].\n\nThe chart is based solely on radio airplay. As of 2012, approximately 80 radio stations are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].<ref>{{cite news|url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BX&s_site=sunherald&p_multi=BX&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10C3552E00587870&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D|title = The charts|work = [[The Sun Herald]]|date = 2005-08-25|accessdate = 2008-01-18|format = fee required}}</ref> Songs are ranked by a calculation of the total number of spins per week with its \"audience impression\", which is based upon exact times of airplay and each station's [[Arbitron]] listener data.

(also called '''Alternative''' and formerly known as '''Modern Rock Tracks''' and '''Hot Modern Rock Tracks''') is a [[music chart]] in the United States that has appeared in [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] since September 10, 1988.  It lists the 40 most-played songs on [[alternative music|alternative]] and [[modern rock]] radio stations. The chart was introduced as a companion to the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart and its creation was prompted by the explosion of alternative music on American radio in the late 1980s. During the first several years of the chart, it regularly featured music that did not receive commercial radio airplay anywhere but on a few modern rock and college rock radio stations. This included many [[electronica|electronic]] and [[post-punk]] artists. Gradually, as alternative rock became more \"mainstream\" (particularly spearheaded by the [[grunge]] explosion in the early 1990s), the Alternative Songs and Mainstream Rock Songs charts began featuring more of the same songs. However, the formats would differentiate themselves by the late 2000s. Today, the Alternative Songs chart favors more [[indie rock]], [[indie pop]], and [[synth-pop]] bands while the Mainstream Rock chart favors more [[alternative rock]], [[hard rock]], and [[heavy metal music]].\n\nThe chart is based solely on radio airplay. As of 2012, approximately 80 radio stations are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].<ref>{{cite news|url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BX&s_site=sunherald&p_multi=BX&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10C3552E00587870&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D|title = The charts|work = [[The Sun Herald]]|date = 2005-08-25|accessdate = 2008-01-18|format = fee required}}</ref> Songs are ranked by a calculation of the total number of spins per week with its \"audience impression\", which is based upon exact times of airplay and each station's [[Arbitron]] listener data.

In Athens, dithyrambs were sung by a [[Greek chorus]] of up to fifty men or boys dancing in circular formation, who may or may not have been dressed as [[Satyr]]s, probably accompanied by the ''[[aulos]]''. They would normally relate some incident in the life of [[Dionysus]] or just celebrate wine and fertility.\n\nThe ancient Greeks laid out the criteria of the dithyramb as follows:\n* special rhythm\n* ''[[aulos]]'' accompaniment in [[Phrygian mode]] <ref>Harvey (1955). [[Aristotle]] records the failed attempt to set it in [[Dorian mode]], in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (8.7).</ref>\n* enriching text\n* considerable narrative content\n* originally [[Antistrophe|antistrophic character]]\n\nCompetitions between groups, singing and dancing dithyrambs were an important part of the festivals of Dionysus, such as the [[Dionysia]] and [[Lenaia]]. Each tribe would enter two choirs, one of men and one of boys, each under the leadership of a ''[[coryphaeus]]''. The names of the winning teams of dithyrambic contests in Athens were recorded. The successful ''[[choregos]]'' would receive a statue that would be erected\u2014at his expense\u2014as a public monument to commemorate the victory.

Schubert's earlier attempt at setting the same poem for a more extended vocal ensemble had remained unfinished ({{D.|number=47}}, 1813). [[Johann Friedrich Reichardt]] (in ''Schillers lyrische Gedichte'' volume 2, published around 1809) and [[Wilhelm Taubert]] (Op. 144 No. 2, 1864) were other composers setting Schiller's poem. Other composers basing vocal music on dithyrambs include [[Giuseppe Verdi]] (\"[[Brindisi (Song Verdi)|Brindisi]]\", No. 6 of his 1845 ''[[Album di Sei Romanze (Verdi)|Album di Sei Romanze]]''), and [[Max Bruch]] (Op. 39, {{circa}} 1871).

[[Richard Edward Wilson]]'s 1983 ''Dithyramb'' is for oboe and clarinet. [[Wolfgang Rihm]] composed a 30-minute work, ''Concerto'', in 2000, with the subtitle ''Dithyrambe'' and a scoring for string quartet and orchestra. \n\nIn 1961 the American choreographer [[James Waring]] created a dance piece entitled ''Dithyramb'' with music and objects by the Fluxus artist [[George Brecht]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Iambus (genre)]]\n* [[Thriambus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book| last = Feder| first = Lillian| title = The Handbook Of Classical Literature| year = 1998| publisher = Da Capo Press| isbn = 978-0-306-80880-7 }}\n* {{cite book| author = E.

Ecce homo. Dionysos-Dithyramben. Nietzsche contra Wagner (= Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften (Hg.): Historischer und kritischer Kommentar zu Friedrich Nietzsches Werken, vol. 6/2), Berlin / Boston: Walter de Gruyter 2013</ref>\n\n===Music and dance===\nFrom the 19th century dithyrambs appear frequently in [[classical music]], as well in vocal as instrumental compositions.\n\n[[Franz Schubert]] wrote a song for bass voice based on Schiller's ''Dithyrambe'' ({{D.}} 801, published as Op. 60 No. 2 in 1826). Schubert's earlier attempt at setting the same poem for a more extended vocal ensemble had remained unfinished ({{D.|number=47}}, 1813). [[Johann Friedrich Reichardt]] (in ''Schillers lyrische Gedichte'' volume 2, published around 1809) and [[Wilhelm Taubert]] (Op. 144 No. 2, 1864) were other composers setting Schiller's poem. Other composers basing vocal music on dithyrambs include [[Giuseppe Verdi]] (\"[[Brindisi (Song Verdi)|Brindisi]]\", No. 6 of his 1845 ''[[Album di Sei Romanze (Verdi)|Album di Sei Romanze]]''), and [[Max Bruch]] (Op. 39, {{circa}} 1871). [[Othmar Schoeck]]'s 1911 [[List of compositions by Othmar Schoeck#Lieder|''Dithyrambe'', Op.&nbsp;22]] is based on an unnamed verse by [[Goethe]].<ref>''Werk- und Nachlassverzeichnis Othmar Schoeck (1886 \u2013 1957)''. Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich. p. 29.

[[Nikolai Medtner]] composed several dithyrambs, including a set of three for solo piano as his Opus 10. Additionally, the final movement of his first violin sonata carries the title, and the last of his ''Vergessene Weisen'' Op. 40 is a ''Danza ditirambica''.\n\nThe last movement of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''Duo Concertant'' for violin and piano is entitled ''Dithyrambe''. [[Richard Edward Wilson]]'s 1983 ''Dithyramb'' is for oboe and clarinet. [[Wolfgang Rihm]] composed a 30-minute work, ''Concerto'', in 2000, with the subtitle ''Dithyrambe'' and a scoring for string quartet and orchestra. \n\nIn 1961 the American choreographer [[James Waring]] created a dance piece entitled ''Dithyramb'' with music and objects by the Fluxus artist [[George Brecht]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Iambus (genre)]]\n* [[Thriambus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book| last = Feder| first = Lillian| title = The Handbook Of Classical Literature| year = 1998| publisher = Da Capo Press| isbn = 978-0-306-80880-7 }}\n* {{cite book| author = E.

Buformin and the other biguanides are not hypoglycemic, but rather antihyperglycemic agents. They do not produce hypoglycemia; instead, they reduce basal and postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetics.<ref>Enrique Ravina, Hugo Kubinyi.

Buformin and the other biguanides are not hypoglycemic, but rather antihyperglycemic agents. They do not produce hypoglycemia; instead, they reduce basal and postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetics.<ref>Enrique Ravina, Hugo Kubinyi.

Earle prosecuted other [[politician]]s, including [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] and State Representative [[Mike Martin (politician)|Mike Martin]], as well as Texas Attorney General [[Jim Mattox]] on charges of commercial bribery.\n\nHis cases against Hutchinson and DeLay were unsuccessful; Hutchinson was found not guilty and DeLay's conviction was overturned on appeal about three years after the conviction. Earle's only success was with [[Mike Martin (politician)|Mike Martin]], although the felony perjury charge was reduced to a misdemeanor after a plea bargain.

His investigation of two political action committees that spent a combined $3.4 million on 22 Republican Texas House races focused on a [[political action committee]] founded by DeLay, (Texans for a Republican Majority PAC). During the investigation, DeLay charged that Earle was a \"runaway district attorney\" with \"a long history of being vindictive and partisan\". On September 28, 2005, a grand jury indicted DeLay for conspiring to violate Texas state election law. Texas prohibits corporate contributions in state legislative races. The indictment charged that [[Texans for a Republican Majority]], DeLay's PAC, accepted corporate contributions, [[money laundering|laundered the money]] through the [[Republican National Committee]], and directed it to favored Republican candidates in Texas.

Mike Martin===\nOn July 31, 1981 during the First Called Session of the Sixty-seventh Texas Legislature, Republican Representative [[Mike Martin (politician)|Mike Martin]], then of [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], was shot in the left arm outside his trailer in Austin with 00-buckshot. Soon after the shooting, unidentified spokespeople from Earle's office released information to the ''Austin American Statesman'' that they felt Martin was telling inconsistent stories to the police. They claimed he first said he had no idea who did it; later he said it was a [[Satanism|Satanic cult]]; in the end, he accused his political enemies. \nMartin responded to the leaks by saying he was asked to give police all possibilities and said he had no idea why the district attorney's office would be saying such things. Earle personally made a public announcement that Martin was cooperating with police and that no one from his office was releasing information saying otherwise to ''The Statesman''. Earle formed a grand jury to look into the shooting of Martin and invited him to attend without issuing a subpoena.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nMartin refused to appear by issuing a statement that he had already given officials all the information he knew. Gregg County District Attorney Rob Foster shortly arrested Martin on a three-year-old [[assault]] charge. The charge was immediately dismissed due to time limits and lack of evidence. Upon release, Martin appeared before reporters and accused Gregg County officials of using their offices to ruin him politically. The day after his release on the assault charge, Martin voluntarily appeared before Earle's grand jury.\n\nAt the time he didn't know that his first cousin, Charles Goff, had previously appeared before the grand jury and admitted helping Martin stage the event to advance Martin's political career. He claimed Martin offered him a state job as payment, despite Texas' strong [[nepotism]] laws forbidding the hiring of relatives. Goff had served prison time and had three outstanding felony warrants pending at the time of his testimony; however, the grand jury took his word over Martin's. After Martin's denial of Goff's accusations before the grand jury, Earle filed felony perjury charges against the freshman legislator. Martin pleaded not guilty and, a year later, worked out a [[plea bargain]] with Earle by admitting to [[misdemeanor]] perjury charges relating to the renting of a car around the time of the shooting. Martin resigned his House seat on April 22, 1982 and withdrew from the upcoming election. Martin filed several suits against Earle, Foster, and Goff for civil rights violations. A federal judge dismissed the last case in June 1985 on grounds that prosecutors enjoy [[qualified immunity]] from [[civil lawsuit|civil suits]]. Martin maintains his innocence regarding Earle's charges.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===LaCresha Murray case===\nIn 1996, Earle indicted 11-year-old LaCresha Murray for [[capital murder]] involving two-year-old Jayla Belton - the youngest [[homicide]] prosecution in Texas history. Earle's evidence rested on an alleged confession by Murray, obtained by interrogation at a children's shelter in the absence of any attorney or family member. Murray's case provoked several public protests of Earle's office and at the Texas State Capitol from her detention in 1996 until her release in 1999, when the case was reviewed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2003-12-12/naked-city/|title=Naked City: Lacresha Murray suit proceeds|last=Smith|first=Jordan|date=2003-12-12|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nMurray was again tried and convicted of intentional injury to a child, receiving a 25-year sentence. In 2001, the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals reversed and remanded her sentence after finding that her confession was illegally obtained. Furthermore, a liver tissue examination by a pathologist expert in the field showed that the injury was inflicted hours before and thus not by Murray; and clothes worn by the toddler had no blood traces that were inevitable given the injuries\u2014indicating the clothes were changed after the toddler was beaten.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2000-11-03/79252/|title=Naked City: Murray's Law|last=Smith|first=Amy|date=2000-11-03|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFaced with the evidence Earle eventually dropped all charges against Murray. In 2002, a suit was filed against the Travis County District Attorney's Office and a host of other individuals and various agencies, which alleged the Murray family had been victimized by [[malicious prosecution]], [[defamation]], [[libel]] and [[slander]], and had suffered mental anguish. Charges of racism were also raised in the suit, suggesting that the Murray family would have been treated differently had they been white. Murray's suit was dismissed; on November 28, 2005, the [[US Supreme Court]] refused to revive the lawsuit.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Maurice Pierce case===\nOn December 6, 1991, four teenage girls were murdered inside a local yogurt shop in Austin. In 1999, Earle led the \"[[Yogurt Shop Murders]]\" case against suspect Maurice Pierce, leading to a grand jury indicting him on four counts of first degree murder. Pierce was arrested, along with Robert Springsteen IV, Michael Scott, and Forrest Welborn, for the murders of four girls. Springsteen and Scott eventually confessed to the crime. Springsteen was convicted and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]]. Scott was convicted and sentenced to [[life in prison]].\n\nWelborn was never indicted for the crime. Pierce continually maintained his innocence up until his release, occurring three years after his arrest. The state could not use Springsteen's and Scott's confessions against Pierce, so, without a confession, and only circumstantial evidence to connect him to the yogurt shop, the state had to either try Pierce or release him. Earle released him and dropped all charges citing a lack of evidence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2003-02-07/144295/|title=Pierce Freed After Three Years: \"Godspeed\"|last=Smith|first=Jordan|date=2003-02-07|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref> The case against Pierce remains open.

DeLay's lawyers asserted the indictment was flawed legally, as laundered money is defined in the Texas Penal Code as money gained in the ''\"proceeds of criminal activity\"''. DeLay's defense stressed that corporate donations to political campaigns are a normal, legal business activity.

Mike Martin===\nOn July 31, 1981 during the First Called Session of the Sixty-seventh Texas Legislature, Republican Representative [[Mike Martin (politician)|Mike Martin]], then of [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], was shot in the left arm outside his trailer in Austin with 00-buckshot. Soon after the shooting, unidentified spokespeople from Earle's office released information to the ''Austin American Statesman'' that they felt Martin was telling inconsistent stories to the police. They claimed he first said he had no idea who did it; later he said it was a [[Satanism|Satanic cult]]; in the end, he accused his political enemies. \nMartin responded to the leaks by saying he was asked to give police all possibilities and said he had no idea why the district attorney's office would be saying such things. Earle personally made a public announcement that Martin was cooperating with police and that no one from his office was releasing information saying otherwise to ''The Statesman''. Earle formed a grand jury to look into the shooting of Martin and invited him to attend without issuing a subpoena.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nMartin refused to appear by issuing a statement that he had already given officials all the information he knew. Gregg County District Attorney Rob Foster shortly arrested Martin on a three-year-old [[assault]] charge. The charge was immediately dismissed due to time limits and lack of evidence. Upon release, Martin appeared before reporters and accused Gregg County officials of using their offices to ruin him politically. The day after his release on the assault charge, Martin voluntarily appeared before Earle's grand jury.\n\nAt the time he didn't know that his first cousin, Charles Goff, had previously appeared before the grand jury and admitted helping Martin stage the event to advance Martin's political career. He claimed Martin offered him a state job as payment, despite Texas' strong [[nepotism]] laws forbidding the hiring of relatives. Goff had served prison time and had three outstanding felony warrants pending at the time of his testimony; however, the grand jury took his word over Martin's. After Martin's denial of Goff's accusations before the grand jury, Earle filed felony perjury charges against the freshman legislator. Martin pleaded not guilty and, a year later, worked out a [[plea bargain]] with Earle by admitting to [[misdemeanor]] perjury charges relating to the renting of a car around the time of the shooting. Martin resigned his House seat on April 22, 1982 and withdrew from the upcoming election. Martin filed several suits against Earle, Foster, and Goff for civil rights violations. A federal judge dismissed the last case in June 1985 on grounds that prosecutors enjoy [[qualified immunity]] from [[civil lawsuit|civil suits]]. Martin maintains his innocence regarding Earle's charges.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===LaCresha Murray case===\nIn 1996, Earle indicted 11-year-old LaCresha Murray for [[capital murder]] involving two-year-old Jayla Belton - the youngest [[homicide]] prosecution in Texas history. Earle's evidence rested on an alleged confession by Murray, obtained by interrogation at a children's shelter in the absence of any attorney or family member. Murray's case provoked several public protests of Earle's office and at the Texas State Capitol from her detention in 1996 until her release in 1999, when the case was reviewed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2003-12-12/naked-city/|title=Naked City: Lacresha Murray suit proceeds|last=Smith|first=Jordan|date=2003-12-12|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nMurray was again tried and convicted of intentional injury to a child, receiving a 25-year sentence. In 2001, the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals reversed and remanded her sentence after finding that her confession was illegally obtained. Furthermore, a liver tissue examination by a pathologist expert in the field showed that the injury was inflicted hours before and thus not by Murray; and clothes worn by the toddler had no blood traces that were inevitable given the injuries\u2014indicating the clothes were changed after the toddler was beaten.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2000-11-03/79252/|title=Naked City: Murray's Law|last=Smith|first=Amy|date=2000-11-03|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFaced with the evidence Earle eventually dropped all charges against Murray. In 2002, a suit was filed against the Travis County District Attorney's Office and a host of other individuals and various agencies, which alleged the Murray family had been victimized by [[malicious prosecution]], [[defamation]], [[libel]] and [[slander]], and had suffered mental anguish. Charges of racism were also raised in the suit, suggesting that the Murray family would have been treated differently had they been white. Murray's suit was dismissed; on November 28, 2005, the [[US Supreme Court]] refused to revive the lawsuit.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Maurice Pierce case===\nOn December 6, 1991, four teenage girls were murdered inside a local yogurt shop in Austin. In 1999, Earle led the \"[[Yogurt Shop Murders]]\" case against suspect Maurice Pierce, leading to a grand jury indicting him on four counts of first degree murder. Pierce was arrested, along with Robert Springsteen IV, Michael Scott, and Forrest Welborn, for the murders of four girls. Springsteen and Scott eventually confessed to the crime. Springsteen was convicted and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]]. Scott was convicted and sentenced to [[life in prison]].\n\nWelborn was never indicted for the crime. Pierce continually maintained his innocence up until his release, occurring three years after his arrest. The state could not use Springsteen's and Scott's confessions against Pierce, so, without a confession, and only circumstantial evidence to connect him to the yogurt shop, the state had to either try Pierce or release him. Earle released him and dropped all charges citing a lack of evidence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2003-02-07/144295/|title=Pierce Freed After Three Years: \"Godspeed\"|last=Smith|first=Jordan|date=2003-02-07|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref> The case against Pierce remains open.

Available from Amazon.com.</ref>\nPimentel's forays into the environmental field came out of his experiences on various government panels and study groups, especially his year as an ecological consultant to the Office of Science and Technology. His study of the energy inputs into the productions of corn in 1973<ref>Pimentel, D., L.E. Hurd, A.C. Bellotti, M.J. Forster, I.N. Oka, O.D. Sholes, and R.J. Whitman. (1973). Food production and the energy crisis. ''Science'' '''182''': 443-449.</ref> was published during the energy crisis of 1973 and became his most cited paper ever. It was followed up by a study of the energy inputs to beef production<ref>Pimentel, D., W. Dritschilo, J. Krummel, and J. Kutzman. (1975). Energy and land constraints in food-protein production. ''Science'' '''190''':754-761.</ref>. By then, he was on his way to become a voice that was listened to on a variety of environmental issues through the numerous studies that he led and published having results that could be inspected.\n\nHe was not a scientist who shied away from controversy or feared contradicting established views. Early in his career, he took on the biological control establishment by suggesting that native pests could be controlled by introducing new parasites and predators, based on observations of successful control of pests in new associations and his genetic feedback model.<ref>Pimentel, D. (1963). Introducing parasites and predators to control native pests. ''Canadian Entomologist'' '''95''': 785\u2013792.</ref>. It was not an idea that was readily accepted, particularly by California biocontrol experts.<ref>Huffaker,C.B., Simmonds, S.J., and  J.E. Laing. (1976). \"The theoretical and empirical basis of biological control.\" Pages 41-78 in Huffaker,  C.B. (ed.)

Academic Press, New York. 788 pp.</ref> but they then rejected (pp 47-49) Pimentel\u2019s work on genetic feedback as an explanatory mechanism involved in biocontrol by insect parasites and predators. Undaunted, Pimentel continued to support and document the use of new associations in biocontrol.<ref>Hokkanen, H.M.T., and D. Pimentel. (1989). New Associations in Biological Control: Theory and Practice.  ''Canadian Entomologist'' '''121''':829-840.</ref> Now called \u201cnew association biological control\u201d as opposed to \u201cclassical biological control,\u201d it is accepted practice in biological control of pests.<ref>Van Driesche, R., and  M. Hoddle. (2009.) Pages 4-5 in ''Control of pests and weeds by natural enemies: an introduction to biological control''. Blackwell Publishing. Malden Massachusetts. 488 pp.</ref>\n\nPimentel was a pioneer in tabulating the energy cost, fossil fuel in particular, of food production. When his suggestion that \u201cenergy was going to be important to agricultural research in the future\u201d  was rebuffed as a future area of study by a 1968 National Academy of Science Panel on which he served, Pimentel set about to put together the needed data himself by creating a graduate research course for his students.<ref>Dritschilo, W. (2019). ''Earth Days Reprised.'' (Pp 389-390.)</ref> Coming out during the 1973 energy crisis, the paper on energy inputs in to corn production received much attention and helped to launch a number of studies and papers, including many by Pimentel and colleagues. That 1973 paper putatively created the controversy over the net energy and environmental impacts of gasohol crops.<ref>[Ruttan, V.W. and Pimentel, D. (1975).

The differences in this case were more substantial and more complex, resulting from differences in ways that energy costs and energy credits are allocated, philosophical differences over the boundaries to calculations, and the differences in quality (liquid versus solid, for example) of energy sources. Greatly simplified, the process of net energy determination is like that of cost-benefit analysis, in which some items can either be added to the cost (the denominator of benefit-to-cost ratio) or subtracted from the benefits (its numerator), yielding different results with the same numbers. It was finally agreed that the allocation of energy credit (subtracting it from inputs) for byproducts in the production of fuels from cellulosic crops as opposed to counting the energy needed for those same byproducts is the main philosophical difference in Pimentel and his associates calculating a negative net energy ratio while others make different choices which yield positive ratios.<ref>Hall, C.A.S., Dale, B.E., and D.

Available from Amazon.com.</ref>\nPimentel's forays into the environmental field came out of his experiences on various government panels and study groups, especially his year as an ecological consultant to the Office of Science and Technology. His study of the energy inputs into the productions of corn in 1973<ref>Pimentel, D., L.E. Hurd, A.C. Bellotti, M.J. Forster, I.N. Oka, O.D. Sholes, and R.J. Whitman. (1973).

It was followed up by a study of the energy inputs to beef production<ref>Pimentel, D., W. Dritschilo, J. Krummel, and J. Kutzman. (1975). Energy and land constraints in food-protein production. ''Science'' '''190''':754-761.</ref>. By then, he was on his way to become a voice that was listened to on a variety of environmental issues through the numerous studies that he led and published having results that could be inspected.\n\nHe was not a scientist who shied away from controversy or feared contradicting established views. Early in his career, he took on the biological control establishment by suggesting that native pests could be controlled by introducing new parasites and predators, based on observations of successful control of pests in new associations and his genetic feedback model.<ref>Pimentel, D. (1963). Introducing parasites and predators to control native pests. ''Canadian Entomologist'' '''95''': 785\u2013792.</ref>. It was not an idea that was readily accepted, particularly by California biocontrol experts.<ref>Huffaker,C.B., Simmonds, S.J., and  J.E. Laing. (1976). \"The theoretical and empirical basis of biological control.\" Pages 41-78 in Huffaker,  C.B. (ed.)

Undaunted, Pimentel continued to support and document the use of new associations in biocontrol.<ref>Hokkanen, H.M.T., and D. Pimentel. (1989).

Hoddle. (2009.) Pages 4-5 in ''Control of pests and weeds by natural enemies: an introduction to biological control''. Blackwell Publishing. Malden Massachusetts. 488 pp.</ref>\n\nPimentel was a pioneer in tabulating the energy cost, fossil fuel in particular, of food production. When his suggestion that \u201cenergy was going to be important to agricultural research in the future\u201d  was rebuffed as a future area of study by a 1968 National Academy of Science Panel on which he served, Pimentel set about to put together the needed data himself by creating a graduate research course for his students.<ref>Dritschilo, W. (2019). ''Earth Days Reprised.'' (Pp 389-390.)</ref> Coming out during the 1973 energy crisis, the paper on energy inputs in to corn production received much attention and helped to launch a number of studies and papers, including many by Pimentel and colleagues. That 1973 paper putatively created the controversy over the net energy and environmental impacts of gasohol crops.<ref>[Ruttan, V.W. and Pimentel, D. (1975).

The differences in this case were more substantial and more complex, resulting from differences in ways that energy costs and energy credits are allocated, philosophical differences over the boundaries to calculations, and the differences in quality (liquid versus solid, for example) of energy sources. Greatly simplified, the process of net energy determination is like that of cost-benefit analysis, in which some items can either be added to the cost (the denominator of benefit-to-cost ratio) or subtracted from the benefits (its numerator), yielding different results with the same numbers. It was finally agreed that the allocation of energy credit (subtracting it from inputs) for byproducts in the production of fuels from cellulosic crops as opposed to counting the energy needed for those same byproducts is the main philosophical difference in Pimentel and his associates calculating a negative net energy ratio while others make different choices which yield positive ratios.<ref>Hall, C.A.S., Dale, B.E., and D.

In the end, the energy inputs quickly fall off to insignificance. Zeno hits the wall without taking an infinite number of steps.\n\nPimentel finished his career holding office or serving on numerous committees, study groups, publications and foundations, including the National Academy of Sciences, the President\u2019s Science Advisory Council, the Office of Technology Assessment of the U.S. Congress, the U.S. State Department, and the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, and Health, Education and Welfare.<ref name=biomedcentral/>\n\n===Public Service===\n'''Governmental Committees'''\n*1964\u20131966 [[President's Science Advisory Committee]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=States |first1=United |title=Restoring the quality of our environment.
