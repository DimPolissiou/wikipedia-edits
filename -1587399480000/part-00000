Reid and Perkins, both survivors of sexual assault themselves, began working on the opera as a way to help overcome their own trauma. \"We started working on the piece about five years ago, before the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] movement, before there was a kind of shift in thinking about what it meant to be a survivor. And it felt really important,\" Reid said in an interview with NPR on April 15th, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2019/04/15/713625417/readjusting-your-reality-ellen-reid-wins-music-pulitzer-for-p-r-i-s-m|title=Readjusting Your Reality: Ellen Reid Wins Music Pulitzer For 'p r i s m'|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref><!--notably stylized as '''p r i s m'''{{r|NYer 2019}} also 2019 NYT--> The opera took a total of 4 years of grueling self-reflection to accurately depict the emotional impact of sexual and emotional abuse.\n\nDespite being written before the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] movement took the internet by storm, this kaleidoscopic opera took on greater significance as a result of the movement, which sought to raise awareness of how prevalent sexual harassment and sexual assault is in society and to help survivors reach out to each other in mutual understanding of their experiences. As more and more survivors came forward about their experiences, the more important the opera became to Ried. When asked about the piece's connection to the movement in an interview with the San Francisco Classical Voice on November 17th, 2018, she said \"We would be writing and come up with ideas we thought would make the story more exciting. Then we would decide to cut them because they were too intense. Then almost exactly the same thing we\u2019d written would show up on the news! The idea of life mirroring art really happened with this piece.\" Despite the real life parallels, these graphic depictions were never actually added to the performance, as Reid sought to depict the more subtle, unseen ways in which survivors are impacted by the event. By delving into the more subtle effects of sexual trauma on the human psyche, the work gives audiences the chance to intimately experience what is like to experience and confront the aftermath of sexual violence in a ways that could only be articulated through the richly intense soundscapes and striking choreography. <ref>https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2019/4/News/Ellen_Reid_s_p_r_i_s_m.html</ref>\n<ref>https://www.sfcv.org/events-calendar/artist-spotlight/ellen-reid-talks-about-her-prism-premiering-this-month-with-la</ref>\n\n''p r i s m'' was presented in a rolling premiere by the LA Opera's Off Grand initiative in November 2018 and at the [[Prototype_Festival|PROTOTYPE Festival]] in January of 2019. The opera was immediately greeted with praise. Simon Williams, one of the critics who attended the premiere, described the piece as a \"heady theatrical concoction that left the audience both exhilarated and confused.\" Mark Swed wrote about it in the LA Times \"It also takes a certain gumption to ask a composer to make a big deal of setting the word \u201cslurp.\u201d Yet Reid makes a big deal of it and everything else. Her fabulous slurping is like nothing you have ever heard before. Her vocal lines have inherent lyrical quality that transcends even the most horrendous emotional outbursts or the disco beat of the club. Musical styles are myriad, yet this is the work of one recognizable voice.\"<ref>https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-ellen-reid-prism-review-20181130-story.html</ref> Catherine Womack wrote in I Care if You Listen \"Above all, p r i s m is about the power that comes from choosing to survive. Through endlessly creative, eclectic music, Reid takes us into a fuzzy place where repressed memories and reality blur. It is not always an easy space in which to sit, but it is one that sticks, lingering in ears and minds for days like mist. It serves as a reminder that when women tell their own stories, when the complexity of a victim\u2019s internal experience is fully fleshed out, the result can be powerful.\"<ref>https://www.icareifyoulisten.com/2018/12/ellen-reid-prism-abstract-story-concrete-truths/</ref> In addition to high praise from critics, ''p r i s m'' was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2019.\n\n== Performance history ==\nThe world premiere of Prism took place at the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]], Los Angeles, California, on 29 November 2018, commissioned by [[Beth Morrison Projects]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bethmorrisonprojects.org/prism|title=P R I S M|website=bmp-opera-music|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> It then went on to premiere in New York at the [[Prototype Festival]]. \"p r i s m\" made its international debut in Sao Paulo, Brazil in August/September of 2019.\n== Roles ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Role\n!Voice Type\n!Premiere Cast, 29 November 2018\n(conductor: Julian Wachner)\n|-\n|Bibi, a daughter\n|[[soprano]]\n|Anna Schubert\n|-\n|Lumee, a mother\n|[[mezzo-soprano]]\n|Rebecca Jo Loeb\n|-\n|Chroma\n|[[Choir|mixed chorus]]\n|12 members of the Choirs of Trinity Wall Street\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|<small>Notes/References:</small><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laopera.org/performances/season-2018-19/prism/|title=Prism {{!}} LA Opera|website=www.laopera.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n== Synopsis ==\n\u201cLocked away in a sterile room, a sickly child Bibi and her doting mother Lumee are each other\u2019s sole protectors from the unknown. When a mysterious illness lurking outside their door leaves Bibi unable to walk, her youthful curiosity begins to simmer and a seductive external existence can no longer be ignored. p r i s m, by [[Ellen Reid (composer)|Ellen Reid]] and [https://roxieperkins.com/ Roxie Perkins], is a haunting, kaleidoscopic new work of opera-theatre that traverses the elasticity of memory after trauma. Composer Ellen Reid\u2019s music erupts with color, using choral and orchestral manipulation to deliver an eerily distinct sonic world.\u201d\n-- from the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater website\n<ref>https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/ellen-reid</ref>\n=== act I ===\nThe first act, titled \"sanctuary as it should be\", utilizes a dreamlike soundscape. Bibi is locked away in a room with her overly concerned mother, Lumee, who serves as her caretaker. The staging for this scene relies on having a boxed room on-stage, representing the tight, closed-off space where Bibi is kept. Inside the box is soft, blue light, which represents the \"safety\" of the sanctuary. This soundscape, which Reid describes as \u201cdreamy and impressionistic\u201d, features lyrical duets between Bibi and Lumee, and the costumes (flowing white gowns), leave a haunting impression that things are too good to be true.  Bibi is unable (or refuses) to walk, as her legs are bruised to the point that she cannot stand on them. She seems timid, fragile, helpless and overly reliant on her mother's care. Lumee obsesses over Bibi, playing with her, giving her medicine, doing all in her power to ensure her daughter is well. Though the music is beautiful, the chorus, in part represented by yellow light, lends to a somewhat ominous tone, the most subtle hint that something is not right. It calls to Bibi, enticing her to leave the sanctuary. It lends itself to questions: is Bibi actually sick? Is Lumee actually a caretaker, or is she desperately pretending that all is well? The audience is left to consider these during the intermission.<ref>https://www.icareifyoulisten.com/2018/12/ellen-reid-prism-abstract-story-concrete-truths/</ref>\n\n=== act II ===\nThe second act, titled \"sanctuary as it was\", takes place outside of the cube, in a club type setting with extremely aggressive club music, instruments pushed to the extremes of their range to extenuate the harshness of their sound. We are suddenly transported back in time to fragmented memories of Bibi's and Lumee's past. The soundscape becomes more modern and techno, a drastic contrast from the impressionistic music from the first act. Strobe lighting is used to create a suddenly disorienting environment, leaving the audience to piece together through the harsh lighting what is unfolding in front of them. In this scene, Bibi stands alone, fascinated by the sensory-filled environment. The audience gets a new perspective on Lumee: a crude, selfish woman. Blue light is cast on Bibi as she is lifted by dancers and carried away. Abstractly, through harsh music and choreography, the audience figures out that Lumee abandoned Bibi in the club, and Bibi was raped. Though no violence is depicted on stage, it is clear that a tragedy is being depicted. To depict the disjointed, pieced-together memories that survivors often have of their assaults, the libretto focuses vividly on minor details, such as the scrunchie that Bibi lost in the midst of the assault.<ref>https://www.icareifyoulisten.com/2018/12/ellen-reid-prism-abstract-story-concrete-truths/</ref>\n\n=== act III ===\nThe third act, titles \"sanctuary as it is\", returns back to the cube, but it depicts a significantly different reality than what was initially presented in the first act. Instead of a pristine room filled with white cloth, the audience is met with a room cluttered with trash and rags. The audience learns definitively that the reality in the first act is merely a fabrication, and the reality is that both women are traumatized, left behind with a tragic existence. Lumee is desperate to forget, to make her daughter forget, to make amends by throwing reality under the rug. The chorus begins to take a greater meaning for Bibi; we learn that the chorus represents the need to face the reality of what happened head on. We learn that all along Bibi wants to remember the events, to truly embrace and heal from it. To escape, she must run from the sanctuary and go out into the world. Despite sending the audience on a harrowing emotional journey, ''p r i s m'' ends with the most poignant and empowering message: that in embracing the truth, by coming forward about your experiences, that it is possible to heal from sexual and emotional abuse.\n\n<ref>https://www.sfcv.org/reviews/los-angeles-opera/through-a-prism-darkly</ref>\n<ref>https://www.icareifyoulisten.com/2018/12/ellen-reid-prism-abstract-story-concrete-truths/</ref>\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThe opera uses 14 members of a chamber orchestra of [[String (music)|strings,]] [[harp]], [[piano]], [[flute]], [[bass clarinet]], [[Horn (instrument)|horn]] and [[Percussion instrument|percussions]] that includes a [[vibraphone]], [[flexatone]] and SPD-SX Sampling Pad, and 12 members of mixed voice [[Chord (music)|chorus]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://classicalvoiceamerica.org/2019/07/24/mcana-award-for-best-new-opera/|title=Reid, Perkins Win Opera Award For Profile In Trauma {{!}} Classical Voice North America|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref><br />\n\n==Reviews==\nMark Swed of the ''Los Angeles Times'' praised Reid, saying \"she evokes a world of its own through a chamber orchestra of strings, shimmering percussion, harp, piano, flute, bass clarinet and horn that becomes a maker of wonder, mystery, suspense, fear and glory...melodies are endless and inventively transformed, the atmospheric pressure ever changing.\"<ref name=swed/> Swed also lauded singers Anna Schubert (Bibi) and Rebecca Jo Loeb (Lumee) stating both are \"strong singers and theatrically forces with which to be contended.\"<ref name=swed/> \n\nJim Farber in his review for ''San Francisco Classical Voice'' said \"the opera treads a fine line between poetic abstraction and gut-wrenching reality...it is Reid\u2019s exceptional score with its wide-range of musical vocabularies, and the dramatic power of Loeb and Schubert\u2019s performances that give prism its overwhelming power.\"<ref name=\"classicalvoice\"/> Farber also commended Reid for freely moving from \"soaring melodies and rich choral harmonies to abrasive dissonance accentuated by the twittering of col legno strings and pre-recorded electronic effects.\"<ref name=\"classicalvoice\"/> He was also impressed with the direction of James Darrah, stating he \"combined confrontation and painful realism with poetic abstraction.\"<ref name=\"classicalvoice\"/>\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[post-traumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress]] experience after sexual assault. Reid received the 2019 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]] for her work on the opera.{{r|NYer 2019}}\n<!--\n== Synopsis ==\n\n\n-->\n\n== Composition history ==\n\n[[Ellen Reid (composer)|Ellen Reid]] began composing ''p r i s m'' in 2015 along with librettist [https://roxieperkins.com/ Roxie Perkins]. Reid and Perkins, both survivors of sexual assault themselves, began working on the opera as a way to help overcome their own trauma. \"We started working on the piece about five years ago, before the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] movement, before there was a kind of shift in thinking about what it meant to be a survivor. And it felt really important,\" Reid said in an interview with NPR on April 15th, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2019/04/15/713625417/readjusting-your-reality-ellen-reid-wins-music-pulitzer-for-p-r-i-s-m|title=Readjusting Your Reality: Ellen Reid Wins Music Pulitzer For 'p r i s m'|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref><!--notably stylized as '''p r i s m'''{{r|NYer 2019}} also 2019 NYT--> The opera took a total of 4 years of grueling self-reflection to accurately depict the emotional impact of sexual and emotional abuse.\n\nDespite being written before the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] movement took the internet by storm, this kaleidoscopic opera took on greater significance as a result of the movement, which sought to raise awareness of how prevalent sexual harassment and sexual assault is in society and to help survivors reach out to each other in mutual understanding of their experiences. As more and more survivors came forward about their experiences, the more important the opera became to Ried. When asked about the piece's connection to the movement in an interview with the San Francisco Classical Voice on November 17th, 2018, she said \"We would be writing and come up with ideas we thought would make the story more exciting. Then we would decide to cut them because they were too intense. Then almost exactly the same thing we\u2019d written would show up on the news! The idea of life mirroring art really happened with this piece.\" Despite the real life parallels, these graphic depictions were never actually added to the performance, as Reid sought to depict the more subtle, unseen ways in which survivors are impacted by the event. By delving into the more subtle effects of sexual trauma on the human psyche, the work gives audiences the chance to intimately experience what is like to experience and confront the aftermath of sexual violence in a ways that could only be articulated through the richly intense soundscapes and striking choreography. <ref>https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2019/4/News/Ellen_Reid_s_p_r_i_s_m.html</ref>\n<ref>https://www.sfcv.org/events-calendar/artist-spotlight/ellen-reid-talks-about-her-prism-premiering-this-month-with-la</ref>\n\n''p r i s m'' was presented in a rolling premiere by the LA Opera's Off Grand initiative in November 2018 and at the [[Prototype_Festival|PROTOTYPE Festival]] in January of 2019. The opera was immediately greeted with praise. Simon Williams, one of the critics who attended the premiere, described the piece as a \"heady theatrical concoction that left the audience both exhilarated and confused.\" Mark Swed wrote about it in the LA Times \"It also takes a certain gumption to ask a composer to make a big deal of setting the word \u201cslurp.\u201d Yet Reid makes a big deal of it and everything else. Her fabulous slurping is like nothing you have ever heard before. Her vocal lines have inherent lyrical quality that transcends even the most horrendous emotional outbursts or the disco beat of the club. Musical styles are myriad, yet this is the work of one recognizable voice.\"<ref>https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-ellen-reid-prism-review-20181130-story.html</ref> Catherine Womack wrote in I Care if You Listen \"Above all, p r i s m is about the power that comes from choosing to survive. Through endlessly creative, eclectic music, Reid takes us into a fuzzy place where repressed memories and reality blur. It is not always an easy space in which to sit, but it is one that sticks, lingering in ears and minds for days like mist. It serves as a reminder that when women tell their own stories, when the complexity of a victim\u2019s internal experience is fully fleshed out, the result can be powerful.\"<ref>https://www.icareifyoulisten.com/2018/12/ellen-reid-prism-abstract-story-concrete-truths/</ref> In addition to high praise from critics, ''p r i s m'' was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2019.\n\n== Performance history ==\nThe world premiere of Prism took place at the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]], Los Angeles, California, on 29 November 2018, commissioned by [[Beth Morrison Projects]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bethmorrisonprojects.org/prism|title=P R I S M|website=bmp-opera-music|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> It then went on to premiere in New York at the [[Prototype Festival]]. \"p r i s m\" made its international debut in Sao Paulo, Brazil in August/September of 2019.\n== Roles ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Role\n!Voice Type\n!Premiere Cast, 29 November 2018\n(conductor: Julian Wachner)\n|-\n|Bibi, a daughter\n|[[soprano]]\n|Anna Schubert\n|-\n|Lumee, a mother\n|[[mezzo-soprano]]\n|Rebecca Jo Loeb\n|-\n|Chroma\n|[[Choir|mixed chorus]]\n|12 members of the Choirs of Trinity Wall Street\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|<small>Notes/References:</small><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laopera.org/performances/season-2018-19/prism/|title=Prism {{!}} LA Opera|website=www.laopera.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n== Synopsis ==\n\u201cLocked away in a sterile room, a sickly child Bibi and her doting mother Lumee are each other\u2019s sole protectors from the unknown. When a mysterious illness lurking outside their door leaves Bibi unable to walk, her youthful curiosity begins to simmer and a seductive external existence can no longer be ignored. p r i s m, by [[Ellen Reid (composer)|Ellen Reid]] and [https://roxieperkins.com/ Roxie Perkins], is a haunting, kaleidoscopic new work of opera-theatre that traverses the elasticity of memory after trauma. Composer Ellen Reid\u2019s music erupts with color, using choral and orchestral manipulation to deliver an eerily distinct sonic world.\u201d\n-- from the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater website\n<ref>https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/ellen-reid</ref>\n=== act I ===\nThe first act, titled \"sanctuary as it should be\", utilizes a dreamlike soundscape. Bibi is locked away in a room with her overly concerned mother, Lumee, who serves as her caretaker. The staging for this scene relies on having a boxed room on-stage, representing the tight, closed-off space where Bibi is kept. Inside the box is soft, blue light, which represents the \"safety\" of the sanctuary. This soundscape, which Reid describes as \u201cdreamy and impressionistic\u201d, features lyrical duets between Bibi and Lumee, and the costumes (flowing white gowns), leave a haunting impression that things are too good to be true.  Bibi is unable (or refuses) to walk, as her legs are bruised to the point that she cannot stand on them. She seems timid, fragile, helpless and overly reliant on her mother's care. Lumee obsesses over Bibi, playing with her, giving her medicine, doing all in her power to ensure her daughter is well. Though the music is beautiful, the chorus, in part represented by yellow light, lends to a somewhat ominous tone, the most subtle hint that something is not right. It calls to Bibi, enticing her to leave the sanctuary. It lends itself to questions: is Bibi actually sick? Is Lumee actually a caretaker, or is she desperately pretending that all is well? The audience is left to consider these during the intermission.<ref>https://www.icareifyoulisten.com/2018/12/ellen-reid-prism-abstract-story-concrete-truths/</ref>\n\n=== act II ===\nThe second act, titled \"sanctuary as it was\", takes place outside of the cube, in a club type setting with extremely aggressive club music, instruments pushed to the extremes of their range to extenuate the harshness of their sound. We are suddenly transported back in time to fragmented memories of Bibi's and Lumee's past. The soundscape becomes more modern and techno, a drastic contrast from the impressionistic music from the first act. Strobe lighting is used to create a suddenly disorienting environment, leaving the audience to piece together through the harsh lighting what is unfolding in front of them.

The only child of [[Keke Rosberg]] (the [[1982 Formula One World Championship|1982 Formula One World Champion]]) and his German wife Sina Rosberg, he was raised primarily in the principality of [[Monaco]]. \n\nRosberg began competitive [[Kart racing|go-kart racing]] at the age of six and achieved early success, winning regional and national French championships, before moving to European-based series and world championships. At the age of sixteen, he progressed to car racing, winning the [[Formula BMW|Formula BMW ADAC Championship]] with VIVA Racing in [[2002 Formula BMW ADAC season|2002]] and claiming nine victories. He subsequently moved to the higher-tier [[Formula 3 Euro Series]] with [[Team Rosberg]] in [[2003 Formula 3 Euro Series|2003]] and [[2004 Formula 3 Euro Series|2004]] before winning the inaugural [[GP2 Series]] championship with [[ART Grand Prix]] in [[2005 GP2 Series|2005]]. \n\nRosberg first drove in [[Formula One]] with [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] from {{F1|2006}} to {{F1|2009}} and achieved two [[Podium#In motorsport|podium]] finishes for the team in {{F1|2008}}. For {{F1|2010}}, he moved to Mercedes, partnering fellow German and seven-time world champion [[Michael Schumacher]]. Rosberg took his first career win at the [[2012 Chinese Grand Prix]]. He was the teammate of former karting friend and eventual six-time World Drivers' Champion, [[Lewis Hamilton]], from {{F1|2013}} to {{F1|2016}}, twice finishing as runner-up to his teammate before winning the title in 2016.\n\nRosberg announced his retirement from motor racing five days after clinching his maiden title, citing wanting to spend more time with his family and not wanting his driving ability to atrophy as the main factors behind his surprise decision. Overall he competed in 206 Grands Prix, winning 23, securing 57 podium finishes, 30 [[pole position]]s, and amassing 1594.5 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|championship points]].

racing driver who won the [[2016 Formula One World Championship]] driving for [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport]]. The only child of [[Keke Rosberg]] (the [[1982 Formula One World Championship|1982 Formula One World Champion]]) and his German wife Sina Rosberg, he was raised primarily in the principality of [[Monaco]]. \n\nRosberg began competitive [[Kart racing|go-kart racing]] at the age of six and achieved early success, winning regional and national French championships, before moving to European-based series and world championships. At the age of sixteen, he progressed to car racing, winning the [[Formula BMW|Formula BMW ADAC Championship]] with VIVA Racing in [[2002 Formula BMW ADAC season|2002]] and claiming nine victories. He subsequently moved to the higher-tier [[Formula 3 Euro Series]] with [[Team Rosberg]] in [[2003 Formula 3 Euro Series|2003]] and [[2004 Formula 3 Euro Series|2004]] before winning the inaugural [[GP2 Series]] championship with [[ART Grand Prix]] in [[2005 GP2 Series|2005]]. \n\nRosberg first drove in [[Formula One]] with [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] from {{F1|2006}} to {{F1|2009}} and achieved two [[Podium#In motorsport|podium]] finishes for the team in {{F1|2008}}. For {{F1|2010}}, he moved to Mercedes, partnering fellow German and seven-time world champion [[Michael Schumacher]]. Rosberg took his first career win at the [[2012 Chinese Grand Prix]]. He was the teammate of former karting friend and eventual six-time World Drivers' Champion, [[Lewis Hamilton]], from {{F1|2013}} to {{F1|2016}}, twice finishing as runner-up to his teammate before winning the title in 2016.\n\nRosberg announced his retirement from motor racing five days after clinching his maiden title, citing wanting to spend more time with his family and not wanting his driving ability to atrophy as the main factors behind his surprise decision. Overall he competed in 206 Grands Prix, winning 23, securing 57 podium finishes, 30 [[pole position]]s, and amassing 1594.5 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|championship points]]. In retirement, Rosberg moved into [[Coach (sport)|driver management]], television [[pundit]]ry, and became an [[Ecopreneurship|eco-entrepreneur]]. He was awarded the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year]] and was inducted into the [[FIA Hall of Fame]] in 2017.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Personal background and

That year, the first building of the [[Morris Industrial School for Indians]], an [[American Indian boarding schools|American Indian boarding school]], was constructed on the site and run by the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Sisters of Mercy]] under contract to the US government. Beginning in 1898, the Office of Indian Affairs (today's [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]) took over operations to introduce a more progressive curriculum.<ref name=Granger>{{cite document |last=Granger |first=Susan |author2=Scott Kelly |author3=Kay Grossman |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: West Central School of Agriculture and Experiment Station Historic District |url={{NRHP url|id=02001707}} |publisher=National Park Service |date=2002-09-13 |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.morris.mn.us/mhrc/articles/mrsIndSchl.shtml|title=City of Morris \u2013 Morris Human Rights Commission: Morris Indian Boarding School |accessdate=2011-01-11 |date= |publisher=City of Morris |first= |last= }}</ref> The school closed in 1909, under a congressionally authorized program to reduce the number of boarding schools in preference for locating schools on reservations, so that families and communities would not be broken up.  The campus was transferred to the State of Minnesota under the agreement that [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] would always be admitted free of tuition; the current UMM still follows this policy.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Unique Campus History |url=https://www4.morris.umn.edu/about/unique-campus-history |publisher=University of Minnesota Morris |year=2016 |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 1910 the [[University of Minnesota]] established a coeducational [[boarding school|residential]] [[high school]] on the campus called the '''West Central School of Agriculture''' ('''WCSA'''). This was one of four such schools established by the University in outstate Minnesota to provide [[agricultural education|agricultural]] and [[home economics]] education to rural youth.  The complex also included an [[agricultural research]] station.  The WCSA operated for half a century, but declining enrollment in the late 1950s prompted the University of Minnesota to phase out its regional agricultural schools. The residents of the Morris region convinced the university to develop the campus as four-year college. The University of Minnesota Morris opened in September 1960, phasing in college classes year by year while phasing out the last high school class, which graduated in 1963.<ref name=Granger />\n\nThe only surviving building from the Morris Industrial School for Indians, an 1899 dormitory, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite web |title=Morris Industrial School for Indians Dormitory |url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/nrhp/NRDetails.cfm-NPSNum=84001696.html |work=Minnesota National Register Properties Database |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |year=2009 |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref>  The oldest building on campus, it now serves as UMM's Multi-Ethnic Resource Center.

At the south edge of campus, a biomass gasification plant\u2014fueled by crop residues from nearby farms\u2014generates steam. The biomass gasifier is part of an integrated system for heating and cooling campus buildings. The combined heat and power system includes a steam turbine, which generates renewable electricity from gasifier steam, and a steam\u2014powered absorption chiller.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://renewables.morris.umn.edu/biomass/facility/|title=University of Minnesota, Morris Renewable Energy Initiatives > Biomass Facility|website=renewables.morris.umn.edu}}</ref>\n\nAt the campus's Regional Fitness Center, locally manufactured solar thermal panels collect the sun's energy to heat swimming pool water. A solar photovoltaic system on the south side of the science building converts sunlight into electricity. On the glacial ridge overlooking the campus, two 1.65 megawatt wind turbines generate renewable electricity for the campus and the region. Shifting to renewable power is just one piece of the campus's comprehensive sustainability strategy. Other measures include historic building reuse, green building design and construction, conservation, local foods programs, hybrid vehicles, innovative curriculum, and community outreach.

The building is designed to house 72 students including 4 community advisors and a hall director. The building will house students during summer for special events and camps.  There are kitchen facilities, a central lounge and patio, and study space. The Green Prairie Living and Learning Community was designed to meet Minnesota B3 sustainability guidelines and LEED Gold certification.

Olympic wrestler, [[Dennis Koslowski]], wrestled for the Cougars in the early 1980s. After a move in the early 1990s as a non-scholarship Division II and a brief experiment with athletic scholarships, Cougar athletics found a more appropriate home in [[NCAA Division III]]'s [[Upper Midwest Athletic Conference]]. They are the first member of the UMAC to be a public, state-supported institution \u2013 all other members over the years were private institutions, usually with a religious affiliation.\n\nUMM was, in 1993, the first college in the [[United States]] to sponsor women's [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]] as an official [[varsity sport]]. The wrestling programs were cut in 2003 due to budget constraints. In 2006, a new men's [[soccer]] team was announced.\n\nIn 2006, UM Morris opened a new football stadium named '''Big Cat Stadium''', just south of the school's Regional Fitness Center. BCS is also used by the Morris Area High School Tigers. The new stadium replaced '''Cougar Field''' which had been used from 1970 to 2005. The school's first football field, named '''Miller Field''', was used from 1961 to 1969.\n\nIn 2006, the [[Minnesota Morris Cougars football|Minnesota Morris Cougars football team]] captured their first UMAC championship in the Hubert H.

The last conference title for the Cougar [[american football|football]] program was the [[Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference|Northern Intercollegiate Conference]] (NIC) title in 1987, the second of two straight NIC titles.  Over the next three years, the Cougars suffered losing records under coach Todd Hickman. In 2010, the team overcame their preseason rating (tied for last) to end the season with a winning record (5\u20134) and ending in a three-way tie for 3rd in the conference. 2016 record (4-6) 2017 record (6-4), undefeated at home.\n\n==Media==\nUniversity students operate the [[radio station]] \"the U-90 alternative, the prairie's only alternative\" 89.7 [[FM band|FM]] ([[KUMM]]).

That year, the first building of the [[Morris Industrial School for Indians]], an [[American Indian boarding schools|American Indian boarding school]], was constructed on the site and run by the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Sisters of Mercy]] under contract to the US government.

The campus was transferred to the State of Minnesota under the agreement that [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] would always be admitted free of tuition; the current UMM still follows this policy.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Unique Campus History |url=https://www4.morris.umn.edu/about/unique-campus-history |publisher=University of Minnesota Morris |year=2016 |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 1910 the [[University of Minnesota]] established a coeducational [[boarding school|residential]] [[high school]] on the campus called the '''West Central School of Agriculture''' ('''WCSA'''). This was one of four such schools established by the University in outstate Minnesota to provide [[agricultural education|agricultural]] and [[home economics]] education to rural youth.  The complex also included an [[agricultural research]] station.  The WCSA operated for half a century, but declining enrollment in the late 1950s prompted the University of Minnesota to phase out its regional agricultural schools. The residents of the Morris region convinced the university to develop the campus as four-year college. The University of Minnesota Morris opened in September 1960, phasing in college classes year by year while phasing out the last high school class, which graduated in 1963.<ref name=Granger />\n\nThe only surviving building from the Morris Industrial School for Indians, an 1899 dormitory, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite web |title=Morris Industrial School for Indians Dormitory |url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/nrhp/NRDetails.cfm-NPSNum=84001696.html |work=Minnesota National Register Properties Database |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |year=2009 |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref>  The oldest building on campus, it now serves as UMM's Multi-Ethnic Resource Center.

At the south edge of campus, a biomass gasification plant\u2014fueled by crop residues from nearby farms\u2014generates steam. The biomass gasifier is part of an integrated system for heating and cooling campus buildings. The combined heat and power system includes a steam turbine, which generates renewable electricity from gasifier steam, and a steam\u2014powered absorption chiller.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://renewables.morris.umn.edu/biomass/facility/|title=University of Minnesota, Morris Renewable Energy Initiatives > Biomass Facility|website=renewables.morris.umn.edu}}</ref>\n\nAt the campus's Regional Fitness Center, locally manufactured solar thermal panels collect the sun's energy to heat swimming pool water. A solar photovoltaic system on the south side of the science building converts sunlight into electricity. On the glacial ridge overlooking the campus, two 1.65 megawatt wind turbines generate renewable electricity for the campus and the region. Shifting to renewable power is just one piece of the campus's comprehensive sustainability strategy. Other measures include historic building reuse, green building design and construction, conservation, local foods programs, hybrid vehicles, innovative curriculum, and community outreach.

The building is designed to house 72 students including 4 community advisors and a hall director. The building will house students during summer for special events and camps.  There are kitchen facilities, a central lounge and patio, and study space. The Green Prairie Living and Learning Community was designed to meet Minnesota B3 sustainability guidelines and LEED Gold certification.

Olympic wrestler, [[Dennis Koslowski]], wrestled for the Cougars in the early 1980s. After a move in the early 1990s as a non-scholarship Division II and a brief experiment with athletic scholarships, Cougar athletics found a more appropriate home in [[NCAA Division III]]'s [[Upper Midwest Athletic Conference]]. They are the first member of the UMAC to be a public, state-supported institution \u2013 all other members over the years were private institutions, usually with a religious affiliation.\n\nUMM was, in 1993, the first college in the [[United States]] to sponsor women's [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]] as an official [[varsity sport]]. The wrestling programs were cut in 2003 due to budget constraints. In 2006, a new men's [[soccer]] team was announced.\n\nIn 2006, UM Morris opened a new football stadium named '''Big Cat Stadium''', just south of the school's Regional Fitness Center. BCS is also used by the Morris Area High School Tigers. The new stadium replaced '''Cougar Field''' which had been used from 1970 to 2005. The school's first football field, named '''Miller Field''', was used from 1961 to 1969.\n\nIn 2006, the [[Minnesota Morris Cougars football|Minnesota Morris Cougars football team]] captured their first UMAC championship in the Hubert H.

The last conference title for the Cougar [[american football|football]] program was the [[Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference|Northern Intercollegiate Conference]] (NIC) title in 1987, the second of two straight NIC titles.  Over the next three years, the Cougars suffered losing records under coach Todd Hickman. In 2010, the team overcame their preseason rating (tied for last) to end the season with a winning record (5\u20134) and ending in a three-way tie for 3rd in the conference. 2016 record (4-6) 2017 record (6-4), undefeated at home.\n\n==Media==\nUniversity students operate the [[radio station]] \"the U-90 alternative, the prairie's only alternative\" 89.7 [[FM band|FM]] ([[KUMM]]).

Hill]], donated {{convert|476|acre|ha}}, and the Northwest Experiment Station was established.\n\nIn 1905, the Minnesota legislature appropriated $15,000 to establish the '''Northwest School of Agriculture''' ('''NWSA'''), a regional residential agricultural high school. Affiliated with the University of Minnesota, the school provided training in \"the technical and practical business of agriculture and in the art of homemaking.\" The school year began in October and ended in March to accommodate farm students. In 1906, the Northwest School of Agriculture officially opened.\n\nIn 1963, the University of Minnesota Bureau of Field Studies began examining the need for a two-year institution of higher education at the NWSA and, in the fall of 1966, the '''University of Minnesota Technical Institute''', a two-year (associate) degree granting institution, opened its doors to the first incoming class of 187 students.\n\nFor two years the NWSA and the Technical Institute shared the campus.  In the spring of 1968 a torch was passed\u2014figuratively and literally\u2014from the 60th and final graduating class of the NWSA to the first graduating class of the Technical Institute, now an official coordinate campus of the University of Minnesota.  In all, 5,433 students completed their high school education at the NWSA. Later in 1968 the name of the campus was changed from the University of Minnesota Technical Institute to the '''University of Minnesota Technical College'''.\n\nBy 1977, the University of Minnesota Technical College had nearly 1,000 students taking classes in a range of degree options in the areas of agriculture; business; home and family services; and hotel, restaurant and institutional management. In 1988, the name was changed to the University of Minnesota Crookston.\n\nIn 1993, the University of Minnesota Crookston became a baccalaureate degree granting institution.  That same year, the university launched its \"Laptop U\" initiative, providing laptop computers to all students and faculty. It is recognized as one of the first programs of its kind in the United States. Over the next few years, more than 100 colleges and universities from across the U.S. and Canada visited the campus to learn more about this innovation.
