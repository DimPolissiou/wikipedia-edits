Rembrandt used this style of painting several times.\n History paintings usually depict a moment in a narrative story, rather than a specific and static subject, as in a portrait.  The term is derived from the wider senses of the word ''historia'' in Latin and Italian, meaning  \"story\" or \"narrative\", and essentially means \"story painting\". Most history paintings are not of scenes from [[history]], especially paintings from before about 1850.\n\nIn modern English, historical painting is sometimes used to describe the painting of scenes from history in its narrower sense, especially for 19th-century art, excluding religious, mythological and allegorical subjects, which are included in the broader term history painting, and before the 19th century were the most common subjects for history paintings.\n\nHistory paintings almost always contain a number of figures, often a large number, and normally show some type of action that is a moment in a narrative. The genre includes depictions of moments in religious narratives, above all the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', as well as narrative scenes from [[mythology]], and also [[allegorical]] scenes.<ref>[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/history-painting National Gallery, Glossary entry]; [http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg61/gg61-main1.html History Painting Gallery] from The National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC; Green and Seddon, 7-8; Harrison, 105-106</ref> These groups were for long the most frequently painted; works such as [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] are therefore history paintings, as are most very large paintings before the 19th century. The term covers large paintings in [[oil on canvas]] or [[fresco]] produced between the Renaissance and the late 19th century, after which the term is generally not used even for the many works that still meet the basic definition.<ref>Green and Seddon, 11-15</ref>\n\nHistory painting may be used interchangeably with '''historical painting''', and was especially so used before the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=History painting|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/History+painting|work=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary|publisher=The Free Dictionary}}</ref>  Where a distinction is made, \"historical painting\" is the painting of scenes from secular history, whether specific episodes or generalized scenes.  In the 19th century, historical painting in this sense became a distinct genre. In phrases such as \"historical painting materials\", \"historical\" means in use before about 1900, or some earlier date.\n\n==Prestige==\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', 1786, with a scene from ancient history.]]\nHistory paintings were traditionally regarded as the highest form of Western painting, occupying the most prestigious place in the [[hierarchy of genres]], and considered the equivalent to the [[epic (genre)|epic]] in literature. In his  ''[[De Pictura]]'' of 1436, [[Leon Battista Alberti]] had argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.<ref>Blunt, 11-12; Barlow, 1</ref>\n\nThis view remained general until the 19th century, when artistic movements began to struggle against the establishment institutions of [[academic art]], which continued to adhere to it. At the same time, there was from the latter part of the 18th century an increased interest in depicting in the form of history painting moments of drama from recent or contemporary history, which had long largely been confined to [[military art|battle-scenes]] and scenes of formal surrenders and the like. Scenes from ancient history had been popular in the [[early Renaissance]], and once again became common in the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] periods, and still more so with the rise of [[Neoclassicism]]. In some 19th or 20th century contexts, the term may refer specifically to paintings of scenes from secular history, rather than those from religious narratives, literature or mythology.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Leo the Great and Attila by Raffael.png|thumb|right|''[[The Meeting of Leo the Great and Attila]]'' by [[Raphael]] and his workshop]]\nThe term is generally not used in art history in speaking of medieval painting, although the Western tradition was developing in large [[altarpiece]]s, fresco cycles, and other works, as well as [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscripts]]. It comes to the fore in [[Italian Renaissance painting]], where a series of increasingly ambitious works were produced, many still religious, but several, especially in Florence, which did actually feature near-contemporary historical scenes such as the set of three huge canvases on ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' by [[Paolo Uccello]], the abortive ''[[Battle of Cascina (Michelangelo)|Battle of Cascina]]'' by Michelangelo and the ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], neither of which were completed. Scenes from ancient history and mythology were also popular. Writers such as Alberti and the following century [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'', followed public and artistic opinion in judging the best painters above all on their production of large works of history painting (though in fact the only modern (post-classical) work described in ''[[De Pictura]]'' is [[Giotto]]'s huge ''[[Navicella (mosaic)|Navicella]]'' in mosaic).  Artists continued for centuries to strive to make their reputation by producing such works, often neglecting genres to which their talents were better suited.\n[[File:Angelo Bronzino 001.jpg|thumb|''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'', [[Agnolo Bronzino]], c. 1545. According to [[Andr\u00e9 F\u00e9libien]] allegory was the highest form of all history painting.]]\n\nThere was some objection to the term, as many writers preferred terms such as \"poetic painting\" (''poesia''), or wanted to make a distinction between the \"true\" ''istoria'', covering history including biblical and religious scenes, and the ''fabula'', covering pagan myth, allegory, and scenes from fiction, which could not be regarded as true.<ref>See Reynolds below; nonetheless he bowed to convention: \"In conformity to custom, I call this part of the art history painting; it ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is.\" (''Discources'', IV); for debates over terminology in the Italian Renaissance, see Bull, 391-394</ref> The large works of [[Raphael]] were long considered, with those of Michelangelo, as the finest models for the genre.\n\nIn the [[Raphael Rooms]] in the [[Vatican Palace]], allegories and historical scenes are mixed together, and the [[Raphael Cartoons]] show scenes from the Gospels, all in the [[Grand Manner]] that from the [[High Renaissance]] became associated with, and often expected in, history painting. In the Late Renaissance and [[Baroque]] the painting of actual history tended to degenerate into panoramic battle-scenes with the victorious monarch or general perched on a horse accompanied with his retinue, or formal scenes of ceremonies, although some artists managed to make a masterpiece from such unpromising material, as [[Vel\u00e1zquez]] did with his ''[[The Surrender of Breda]]''.\n\nAn influential formulation of the hierarchy of genres, confirming the history painting at the top, was made in 1667 by [[Andr\u00e9 F\u00e9libien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:<blockquote>Celui qui fait parfaitement des pa\u00efsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne repr\u00e9sentent que des choses mortes & sans mouvement; & comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, & ne peut pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 l'honneur que re\u00e7oivent les plus s\u00e7avans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation de plusieurs ensemble; il faut traiter l'histoire & la fable; il faut repr\u00e9senter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agr\u00e9ables comme les Po\u00ebtes; & montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions all\u00e9goriques, s\u00e7avoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, & les myst\u00e8res les plus relevez.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&lpg=PA96&dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&lr=&as_brr=3&pg=PA97#v=onepage&q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled. For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal\".</blockquote>\n\nBy the late 18th century, with both religious and mytholological painting in decline, there was an increased demand for paintings of scenes from history, including contemporary history. This was in part driven by the changing audience for ambitious paintings, which now increasingly made their reputation in public exhibitions rather than by impressing the owners of and visitors to palaces and public buildings. Classical history remained popular, but scenes from national histories were often the best-received. From 1760 onwards, the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain]], the first body to organize regular exhibitions in London, awarded two generous prizes each year to paintings of subjects from British history.<ref>Strong, 17, and 32-34 and generally on growth of historical painting.</ref> \n[[Image:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Benjamin West]], ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770), an early example of the vogue for painting scenes from recent history.]]\n\nThe unheroic nature of modern dress was regarded as a serious difficulty. When, in 1770, [[Benjamin West]] proposed to paint ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' in contemporary dress, he was firmly instructed to use classical costume by many people. He ignored these comments and showed the scene in modern dress. Although [[George III]] refused to purchase the work, West succeeded both in overcoming his critics' objections and inaugurating a more historically accurate style in such paintings.<ref>Rothenstein, 16-17; Strong, 24-26</ref> Other artists depicted scenes, regardless of when they occurred, in classical dress and for a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depictions of the heroic male nude.\n\nThe large production, using the finest French artists, of propaganda paintings glorifying the exploits of [[Napoleon]], were matched by works, showing both victories and losses, from the anti-Napoleonic alliance by artists such as [[Goya]] and [[J.M.W. Turner]]. [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818\u20131819) was a sensation, appearing to update the history painting for the 19th century, and showing anonymous figures famous only for being victims of what was then a famous and controversial disaster at sea. Conveniently their clothes had been worn away to classical-seeming rags by the point the painting depicts. At the same time the demand for traditional large religious history paintings very largely fell away.\n[[File:David Wilkie Chelsea Pensioners Reading the Waterloo Dispatch.jpg|thumb|300px|[[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]], ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'', 1822. Genre or history painting? The types have merged, in a way typical of the 19th century.]]\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century there arose a style known as [[historicism (art)|historicism]], which marked a formal imitation of historical styles and/or artists. Another development in the nineteenth century was the treatment of historical subjects, often on a large scale, with the values of [[Genre works|genre painting]], the depiction of scenes of everyday life, and [[anecdote]]. Grand depictions of events of great public importance were supplemented with scenes depicting more personal incidents in the lives of the great, or of scenes centred on unnamed figures involved in historical events, as in the [[Troubadour style]]. At the same time scenes of ordinary life with moral, political or satirical content became often the main vehicle for expressive interplay between figures in painting, whether given a modern or historical setting.\n\nBy the later 19th century, history painting was often explicitly rejected by [[avant-garde]] movements such as the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] (except for [[\u00c9douard Manet]]) and the [[Symbolist]]s, and according to one recent writer \"[[Modernism]] was to a considerable extent built upon the rejection of History Painting... All other genres are deemed capable of entering, in one form or another, the 'pantheon' of modernity considered, but History Painting is excluded\".<ref>Barlow, 1</ref>\n\n==History painting and historical painting==\n[[File:Past and Present Number One.jpg|thumb|left|\"No. 1, Misfortune\" from [[Augustus Egg]]'s ''[[Past and Present (paintings)|Past and Present]]'', 1858. The husband has discovered his wife's infidelity. ''Prayer'' and ''Despair'' complete the set.]]\n\n===The terms===\nInitially, \"history painting\" and \"historical painting\" were used interchangeably in English, as when Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] in his fourth ''Discourse'' uses both indiscriminately to cover \"history painting\", while saying \"...it ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is\", reflecting the French term ''peinture historique'', one equivalent of \"history painting\".  The terms began to separate in the 19th century, with \"historical painting\" becoming a sub-group of \"history painting\" restricted to subjects taken from history in its normal sense.  In 1853 [[John Ruskin]] asked his audience: \"What do you at present ''mean'' by historical painting? Now-a-days it means the endeavour, by the power of imagination, to portray some historical event of past days.\"<ref>Lecture IV, p. 172, ''Lectures on Architecture and Painting: Delivered at Edinburgh, in November, 1853'', 1854, Wiley, [https://archive.org/details/lecturesonarchi02ruskgoog/page/n194 <!-- pg=172 quote=\"historical painting\". --> Internet Archive].</ref>  So for example [[Harold Wethey]]'s three-volume catalogue of the paintings of [[Titian]] (Phaidon, 1969\u201375) is divided between \"Religious Paintings\", \"Portraits\", and \"Mythological and Historical Paintings\", though both volumes I and III cover what is included in the term \"History Paintings\".  This distinction is useful but is by no means generally observed, and the terms are still often used in a confusing manner. Because of the potential for confusion modern academic writing tends to avoid the phrase \"historical painting\", talking instead of \"historical subject matter\" in history painting, but where the phrase is still used in contemporary scholarship it will normally mean the painting of subjects from history, very often in the 19th century.<ref>As shown in the usages in Barlow, Strong, and Wright</ref>  \"Historical painting\" may also be used, especially in discussion of painting techniques in conservation studies, to mean \"old\", as opposed to modern or recent painting.<ref>As in \"The beautifully renovated Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam will open its doors to the public in 2013. To celebrate this event the Rijksmuseum will host a three-day symposium on Historical Painting Techniques. The central theme of the symposium will be the technical study of historically used painting techniques, the historical painting materials, their origin and trade, and their application in the painter\u2019s workshop.\" [https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/research-and-library/painting-techniques Rijksmuseum, \"Painting Techniques - Call for Papers\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531094855/https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/research-and-library/painting-techniques |date=2013-05-31 }}</ref>\n\nIn 19th-century British writing on art the terms \"'''subject painting'''\" or \"anecdotic\" painting were often used for works in a line of development going back to [[William Hogarth]] of monoscenic depictions of crucial moments in an implied narrative with unidentified characters,<ref>{{cite book|author=Pamela M.

During the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods the heroic treatment of contemporary history in a frankly propagandistic fashion by [[Antoine-Jean, Baron Gros]], [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Carle Vernet]] and others was supported by the French state, but after the fall of Napoleon in 1815 the French governments were not regarded as suitable for heroic treatment and many artists retreated further into the past to find subjects, though in Britain depicting the victories of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] mostly occurred after they were over.  Another path was to choose contemporary subjects that were oppositional to government either at home and abroad, and many of what were arguably the last great generation of history paintings were protests at contemporary episodes of repression or outrages at home or abroad: [[Goya]]'s ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' (1814), [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818\u201319), [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]'s ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) and ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830).  These were heroic, but showed heroic suffering by ordinary civilians.\n[[File:PAUL DELAROCHE - Ejecuci\u00f3n de Lady Jane Grey (National Gallery de Londres, 1834).jpg|thumb|[[Paul Delaroche]], ''[[The Execution of Lady Jane Grey]]'', 1833, [[National Gallery]], London]]\n[[File:Conversi\u00f3n del duque de Gand\u00eda, Museo del Prado.jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 Moreno Carbonero]], ''Conversion of the Duke of Gand\u00eda'', 1881, [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid]]\n[[Romanticism|Romantic artists]] such as G\u00e9ricault and Delacroix, and those from other movements such as the English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] continued to regard history painting as the ideal for their most ambitious works. Others such as [[Jan Matejko]] in Poland, [[Vasily Surikov]] in Russia, [[Jos\u00e9 Moreno Carbonero]] in Spain and [[Paul Delaroche]] in France became specialized painters of large historical subjects.  The ''[[style troubadour]]'' (\"[[troubadour]] style\") was a somewhat derisive French term for earlier paintings of medieval and Renaissance scenes, which were often small and depicting moments of anecdote rather than drama; [[Ingres]], [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] and  [[Henri Jean-Baptiste Victoire Fradelle|Henri Fradelle]] painted such works. Sir [[Roy Strong]] calls this type of work the \"Intimate Romantic\", and in French it was known as the \"peinture de genre historique\" or \"peinture anecdotique\" (\"historical genre painting\" or \"anecdotal painting\").<ref>Strong, 36-40; Wright, 269-273, French terms on p. 269</ref>\n\nChurch commissions for large group scenes from the Bible had greatly reduced, and historical painting became very significant.  Especially in the early 19th century, much historical painting depicted specific moments from historical literature, with the novels of Sir [[Walter Scott]] a particular favourite, in France and other European countries as much as Great Britain.<ref>Wright, throughout; Strong, 30-32</ref>  By the middle of the century medieval scenes were expected to be very carefully researched, using the work of historians of costume, architecture and all elements of decor that were becoming available. And example of this is the extensive research of Byzantine architecture, clothing and decoration made in Parisian museums and libraries by [[Jos\u00e9 Moreno Carbonero|Moreno Carbonero]] for his masterwork ''The Entry of Roger de Flor in Constantinople''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.artehistoria.com/es/obra/entrada-de-roger-de-flor-en-constantinopla|title=Entrada de Roger de Flor en Constantinopla {{!}} artehistoria.com|website=www.artehistoria.com|language=es|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> The provision of examples and expertise for artists, as well as revivalist industrial designers, was one of the motivations for the establishment of museums like the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.<ref>Strong, 24-26, 47-73; Wright, 269-273</ref>\n\nNew techniques of [[printmaking]] such as the [[chromolithograph]] made good quality [[monochrome]] print reproductions both relatively cheap and very widely accessible, and also hugely profitable for artist and publisher, as the sales were so large.<ref>Harding, 7-9</ref>  Historical painting often had a close relationship with [[Nationalism]], and painters like Matejko in Poland could play an important role in fixing the prevailing historical narrative of national history in the popular mind.<ref>Strong, 32-36</ref>  In France, ''[[L'art Pompier]]'' (\"Fireman art\") was a derisory term for official academic historical painting,<ref>Harding, throughout</ref> and in a final phase, \"History painting of a debased sort, scenes of brutality and terror, purporting to illustrate episodes from Roman and Moorish history, were Salon sensations.

History paintings usually depict a moment in a narrative story, rather than a specific and static subject, as in a portrait.  The term is derived from the wider senses of the word ''historia'' in Latin and Italian, meaning  \"story\" or \"narrative\", and essentially means \"story painting\". Most history paintings are not of scenes from [[history]], especially paintings from before about 1850.\n\nIn modern English, historical painting is sometimes used to describe the painting of scenes from history in its narrower sense, especially for 19th-century art, excluding religious, mythological and allegorical subjects, which are included in the broader term history painting, and before the 19th century were the most common subjects for history paintings.\n\nHistory paintings almost always contain a number of figures, often a large number, and normally show some type of action that is a moment in a narrative. The genre includes depictions of moments in religious narratives, above all the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', as well as narrative scenes from [[mythology]], and also [[allegorical]] scenes.<ref>[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/history-painting National Gallery, Glossary entry]; [http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg61/gg61-main1.html History Painting Gallery] from The National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC; Green and Seddon, 7-8; Harrison, 105-106</ref> These groups were for long the most frequently painted; works such as [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] are therefore history paintings, as are most very large paintings before the 19th century. The term covers large paintings in [[oil on canvas]] or [[fresco]] produced between the Renaissance and the late 19th century, after which the term is generally not used even for the many works that still meet the basic definition.<ref>Green and Seddon, 11-15</ref>\n\nHistory painting may be used interchangeably with '''historical painting''', and was especially so used before the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=History painting|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/History+painting|work=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary|publisher=The Free Dictionary}}</ref>  Where a distinction is made, \"historical painting\" is the painting of scenes from secular history, whether specific episodes or generalized scenes.  In the 19th century, historical painting in this sense became a distinct genre. In phrases such as \"historical painting materials\", \"historical\" means in use before about 1900, or some earlier date.\n\n==Prestige==\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', 1786, with a scene from ancient history.]]\nHistory paintings were traditionally regarded as the highest form of Western painting, occupying the most prestigious place in the [[hierarchy of genres]], and considered the equivalent to the [[epic (genre)|epic]] in literature. In his  ''[[De Pictura]]'' of 1436, [[Leon Battista Alberti]] had argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.<ref>Blunt, 11-12; Barlow, 1</ref>\n\nThis view remained general until the 19th century, when artistic movements began to struggle against the establishment institutions of [[academic art]], which continued to adhere to it. At the same time, there was from the latter part of the 18th century an increased interest in depicting in the form of history painting moments of drama from recent or contemporary history, which had long largely been confined to [[military art|battle-scenes]] and scenes of formal surrenders and the like. Scenes from ancient history had been popular in the [[early Renaissance]], and once again became common in the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] periods, and still more so with the rise of [[Neoclassicism]]. In some 19th or 20th century contexts, the term may refer specifically to paintings of scenes from secular history, rather than those from religious narratives, literature or mythology.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Leo the Great and Attila by Raffael.png|thumb|right|''[[The Meeting of Leo the Great and Attila]]'' by [[Raphael]] and his workshop]]\nThe term is generally not used in art history in speaking of medieval painting, although the Western tradition was developing in large [[altarpiece]]s, fresco cycles, and other works, as well as [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscripts]]. It comes to the fore in [[Italian Renaissance painting]], where a series of increasingly ambitious works were produced, many still religious, but several, especially in Florence, which did actually feature near-contemporary historical scenes such as the set of three huge canvases on ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' by [[Paolo Uccello]], the abortive ''[[Battle of Cascina (Michelangelo)|Battle of Cascina]]'' by Michelangelo and the ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], neither of which were completed. Scenes from ancient history and mythology were also popular. Writers such as Alberti and the following century [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'', followed public and artistic opinion in judging the best painters above all on their production of large works of history painting (though in fact the only modern (post-classical) work described in ''[[De Pictura]]'' is [[Giotto]]'s huge ''[[Navicella (mosaic)|Navicella]]'' in mosaic).  Artists continued for centuries to strive to make their reputation by producing such works, often neglecting genres to which their talents were better suited.\n[[File:Angelo Bronzino 001.jpg|thumb|''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'', [[Agnolo Bronzino]], c. 1545. According to [[Andr\u00e9 F\u00e9libien]] allegory was the highest form of all history painting.]]\n\nThere was some objection to the term, as many writers preferred terms such as \"poetic painting\" (''poesia''), or wanted to make a distinction between the \"true\" ''istoria'', covering history including biblical and religious scenes, and the ''fabula'', covering pagan myth, allegory, and scenes from fiction, which could not be regarded as true.<ref>See Reynolds below; nonetheless he bowed to convention: \"In conformity to custom, I call this part of the art history painting; it ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is.\" (''Discources'', IV); for debates over terminology in the Italian Renaissance, see Bull, 391-394</ref> The large works of [[Raphael]] were long considered, with those of Michelangelo, as the finest models for the genre.\n\nIn the [[Raphael Rooms]] in the [[Vatican Palace]], allegories and historical scenes are mixed together, and the [[Raphael Cartoons]] show scenes from the Gospels, all in the [[Grand Manner]] that from the [[High Renaissance]] became associated with, and often expected in, history painting. In the Late Renaissance and [[Baroque]] the painting of actual history tended to degenerate into panoramic battle-scenes with the victorious monarch or general perched on a horse accompanied with his retinue, or formal scenes of ceremonies, although some artists managed to make a masterpiece from such unpromising material, as [[Vel\u00e1zquez]] did with his ''[[The Surrender of Breda]]''.\n\nAn influential formulation of the hierarchy of genres, confirming the history painting at the top, was made in 1667 by [[Andr\u00e9 F\u00e9libien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:<blockquote>Celui qui fait parfaitement des pa\u00efsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne repr\u00e9sentent que des choses mortes & sans mouvement; & comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, & ne peut pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 l'honneur que re\u00e7oivent les plus s\u00e7avans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation de plusieurs ensemble; il faut traiter l'histoire & la fable; il faut repr\u00e9senter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agr\u00e9ables comme les Po\u00ebtes; & montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions all\u00e9goriques, s\u00e7avoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, & les myst\u00e8res les plus relevez.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&lpg=PA96&dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&lr=&as_brr=3&pg=PA97#v=onepage&q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled. For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal\".</blockquote>\n\nBy the late 18th century, with both religious and mytholological painting in decline, there was an increased demand for paintings of scenes from history, including contemporary history. This was in part driven by the changing audience for ambitious paintings, which now increasingly made their reputation in public exhibitions rather than by impressing the owners of and visitors to palaces and public buildings. Classical history remained popular, but scenes from national histories were often the best-received. From 1760 onwards, the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain]], the first body to organize regular exhibitions in London, awarded two generous prizes each year to paintings of subjects from British history.<ref>Strong, 17, and 32-34 and generally on growth of historical painting.</ref> \n[[Image:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Benjamin West]], ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770), an early example of the vogue for painting scenes from recent history.]]\n\nThe unheroic nature of modern dress was regarded as a serious difficulty. When, in 1770, [[Benjamin West]] proposed to paint ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' in contemporary dress, he was firmly instructed to use classical costume by many people. He ignored these comments and showed the scene in modern dress. Although [[George III]] refused to purchase the work, West succeeded both in overcoming his critics' objections and inaugurating a more historically accurate style in such paintings.<ref>Rothenstein, 16-17; Strong, 24-26</ref> Other artists depicted scenes, regardless of when they occurred, in classical dress and for a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depictions of the heroic male nude.\n\nThe large production, using the finest French artists, of propaganda paintings glorifying the exploits of [[Napoleon]], were matched by works, showing both victories and losses, from the anti-Napoleonic alliance by artists such as [[Goya]] and [[J.M.W. Turner]]. [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818\u20131819) was a sensation, appearing to update the history painting for the 19th century, and showing anonymous figures famous only for being victims of what was then a famous and controversial disaster at sea. Conveniently their clothes had been worn away to classical-seeming rags by the point the painting depicts. At the same time the demand for traditional large religious history paintings very largely fell away.\n[[File:David Wilkie Chelsea Pensioners Reading the Waterloo Dispatch.jpg|thumb|300px|[[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]], ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'', 1822. Genre or history painting? The types have merged, in a way typical of the 19th century.]]\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century there arose a style known as [[historicism (art)|historicism]], which marked a formal imitation of historical styles and/or artists. Another development in the nineteenth century was the treatment of historical subjects, often on a large scale, with the values of [[Genre works|genre painting]], the depiction of scenes of everyday life, and [[anecdote]]. Grand depictions of events of great public importance were supplemented with scenes depicting more personal incidents in the lives of the great, or of scenes centred on unnamed figures involved in historical events, as in the [[Troubadour style]]. At the same time scenes of ordinary life with moral, political or satirical content became often the main vehicle for expressive interplay between figures in painting, whether given a modern or historical setting.\n\nBy the later 19th century, history painting was often explicitly rejected by [[avant-garde]] movements such as the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] (except for [[\u00c9douard Manet]]) and the [[Symbolist]]s, and according to one recent writer \"[[Modernism]] was to a considerable extent built upon the rejection of History Painting... All other genres are deemed capable of entering, in one form or another, the 'pantheon' of modernity considered, but History Painting is excluded\".<ref>Barlow, 1</ref>\n\n==History painting and historical painting==\n[[File:Past and Present Number One.jpg|thumb|left|\"No. 1, Misfortune\" from [[Augustus Egg]]'s ''[[Past and Present (paintings)|Past and Present]]'', 1858. The husband has discovered his wife's infidelity. ''Prayer'' and ''Despair'' complete the set.]]\n\n===The terms===\nInitially, \"history painting\" and \"historical painting\" were used interchangeably in English, as when Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] in his fourth ''Discourse'' uses both indiscriminately to cover \"history painting\", while saying \"...it ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is\", reflecting the French term ''peinture historique'', one equivalent of \"history painting\".  The terms began to separate in the 19th century, with \"historical painting\" becoming a sub-group of \"history painting\" restricted to subjects taken from history in its normal sense.  In 1853 [[John Ruskin]] asked his audience: \"What do you at present ''mean'' by historical painting? Now-a-days it means the endeavour, by the power of imagination, to portray some historical event of past days.\"<ref>Lecture IV, p. 172, ''Lectures on Architecture and Painting: Delivered at Edinburgh, in November, 1853'', 1854, Wiley, [https://archive.org/details/lecturesonarchi02ruskgoog/page/n194 <!-- pg=172 quote=\"historical painting\". --> Internet Archive].</ref>  So for example [[Harold Wethey]]'s three-volume catalogue of the paintings of [[Titian]] (Phaidon, 1969\u201375) is divided between \"Religious Paintings\", \"Portraits\", and \"Mythological and Historical Paintings\", though both volumes I and III cover what is included in the term \"History Paintings\".  This distinction is useful but is by no means generally observed, and the terms are still often used in a confusing manner. Because of the potential for confusion modern academic writing tends to avoid the phrase \"historical painting\", talking instead of \"historical subject matter\" in history painting, but where the phrase is still used in contemporary scholarship it will normally mean the painting of subjects from history, very often in the 19th century.<ref>As shown in the usages in Barlow, Strong, and Wright</ref>  \"Historical painting\" may also be used, especially in discussion of painting techniques in conservation studies, to mean \"old\", as opposed to modern or recent painting.<ref>As in \"The beautifully renovated Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam will open its doors to the public in 2013. To celebrate this event the Rijksmuseum will host a three-day symposium on Historical Painting Techniques. The central theme of the symposium will be the technical study of historically used painting techniques, the historical painting materials, their origin and trade, and their application in the painter\u2019s workshop.\" [https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/research-and-library/painting-techniques Rijksmuseum, \"Painting Techniques - Call for Papers\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531094855/https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/research-and-library/painting-techniques |date=2013-05-31 }}</ref>\n\nIn 19th-century British writing on art the terms \"'''subject painting'''\" or \"anecdotic\" painting were often used for works in a line of development going back to [[William Hogarth]] of monoscenic depictions of crucial moments in an implied narrative with unidentified characters,<ref>{{cite book|author=Pamela M.

During the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods the heroic treatment of contemporary history in a frankly propagandistic fashion by [[Antoine-Jean, Baron Gros]], [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Carle Vernet]] and others was supported by the French state, but after the fall of Napoleon in 1815 the French governments were not regarded as suitable for heroic treatment and many artists retreated further into the past to find subjects, though in Britain depicting the victories of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] mostly occurred after they were over.  Another path was to choose contemporary subjects that were oppositional to government either at home and abroad, and many of what were arguably the last great generation of history paintings were protests at contemporary episodes of repression or outrages at home or abroad: [[Goya]]'s ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' (1814), [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818\u201319), [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]'s ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) and ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830).  These were heroic, but showed heroic suffering by ordinary civilians.\n[[File:PAUL DELAROCHE - Ejecuci\u00f3n de Lady Jane Grey (National Gallery de Londres, 1834).jpg|thumb|[[Paul Delaroche]], ''[[The Execution of Lady Jane Grey]]'', 1833, [[National Gallery]], London]]\n[[File:Conversi\u00f3n del duque de Gand\u00eda, Museo del Prado.jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 Moreno Carbonero]], ''Conversion of the Duke of Gand\u00eda'', 1881, [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid]]\n[[Romanticism|Romantic artists]] such as G\u00e9ricault and Delacroix, and those from other movements such as the English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] continued to regard history painting as the ideal for their most ambitious works. Others such as [[Jan Matejko]] in Poland, [[Vasily Surikov]] in Russia, [[Jos\u00e9 Moreno Carbonero]] in Spain and [[Paul Delaroche]] in France became specialized painters of large historical subjects.  The ''[[style troubadour]]'' (\"[[troubadour]] style\") was a somewhat derisive French term for earlier paintings of medieval and Renaissance scenes, which were often small and depicting moments of anecdote rather than drama; [[Ingres]], [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] and  [[Henri Jean-Baptiste Victoire Fradelle|Henri Fradelle]] painted such works. Sir [[Roy Strong]] calls this type of work the \"Intimate Romantic\", and in French it was known as the \"peinture de genre historique\" or \"peinture anecdotique\" (\"historical genre painting\" or \"anecdotal painting\").<ref>Strong, 36-40; Wright, 269-273, French terms on p. 269</ref>\n\nChurch commissions for large group scenes from the Bible had greatly reduced, and historical painting became very significant.

They are addressed as \"Senior Chief\" in most circumstances, or sometimes, less formally, as \"Senior\".\n\nAdvancement to senior chief petty officer is similar to that of chief petty officer. It carries requirements of time in service, superior evaluation scores, and peer review. In the Navy, it is the first promotion that is based entirely on proven leadership performance; test scores do not play a part. A chief petty officer can only advance to senior chief if a board of master chiefs approves, convened every year around March. Senior chief petty officers make up just 2.5% of the total enlisted force of the Navy and overall fall within the top 4% of the enlisted ranks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/517 |title=10 U.S.C. \u00a7 517 |publisher=law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>\n\nIn the Coast Guard, advancement to senior chief is similar to other advancements, in that candidates compete with other advancement-eligible chief petty officers.  Advancement-eligible chief petty officers are prioritized based on written examination scores, evaluations, award points, time in service, and time in grade.  Senior chief petty officers are then selected monthly from this prioritization list as positions become available.\n\nAs do chief petty officers, senior chief petty officers take on more advanced leadership duties in their new paygrade. In the Navy, their khaki uniform continues to reflect their responsibility level: It is similar to an officer's uniform, but with different insignia.  (In the Coast Guard, petty officers, chief petty officers, warrant officers, and commissioned officers all wear similar uniforms.)\n\nLike petty officers, every chief has both a rate (rank) and [[List of United States Navy ratings|rating]] (job, similar to an [[Military Occupational Specialty|MOS]] in other branches). A chief's full title is a combination of the two. Thus, a senior chief petty officer with the rating of machinist's mate would properly be called a senior chief machinist's mate, the abbreviation of which is ''MMCS''.\n\nEach rating has an official abbreviation, such as MM for machinist's mate, QM for quartermaster, and YN for yeoman.  The rating and the rate combined give the abbreviation of a senior chief's full title, such as BMCS for senior chief boatswain's mate. In the expanded form, the title of senior chief always precedes the rating. It is not uncommon practice to refer to a senior chief petty officer by this shorthand in all but the most formal correspondence (such as printing and inscription on awards).\n\nThe rating insignia for a senior chief is an eagle with spread wings above three chevrons. The chevrons are topped by a rocker that goes behind the eagle (or \"crow\", as it is commonly called). An inverted star (similar to the stars on the sleeves of line officers) is above the eagle. This is used on the dress blue uniform. On all other uniforms, the insignia used is the one that has become universally accepted as the symbol of the chief petty officer: a fouled (entwined in the anchor chain) gold anchor superimposed with a silver \"USN\" in the Navy or a silver shield in the Coast Guard. As in the dress blue insignia, the anchor is capped by an down-pointing star.\n\nIn the Navy, officers and chiefs are referred to as \"[[khaki]]s\". This is a reference to the color of one of their most common uniforms and is a direct contrast to those in paygrades E-6 and below (\"blueshirts\").\n\n===Command senior chief petty officer===\n{{See also|Command master chief petty officer}}\nAs of 2005 and after a pilot program taking place on three mine countermeasures ships, the Navy started appointing senior chiefs to command roles. Until this time, senior chiefs had a senior enlisted leadership role in the submarine force as [[Chief of the Boat|chiefs of the boat]]. This new effort works to formalize leadership at the senior chief level. In July 2015, the rate was formally established as a rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=90372|title=Navy Announces Command Senior Chief Rating|first=This story was written by Chief of Naval|last=Personnel|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/navy-creates-new-command-senior-chief-rate-1.360530|title=Navy creates new command senior chief rate|publisher=}}</ref> Before it had been a billet instead of a rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2015/08/02/new-command-rating-announced-for-senior-chiefs/|title=New command rating announced for senior chiefs|first=Mark D.|last=Faram|date=22 August 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2016/NAV16210.txt</ref>\n\n==Ireland==\n\n===Irish Naval Service===\nSenior chief petty officer is also a rank in the [[Irish Naval Service]] ([[Gaeilge|Irish]]: ''Ard-Mhion-Oifigeach Sinsearach''). The rank is deemed equivalent to a member of the NATO armed forces ranked E-8, making it the equivalent of a senior chief petty officer in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] or a [[Warrant Officer Class 2#Royal Navy|warrant officer class 2]] in the [[Royal Navy]]. The rank is one grade below an Irish [[Warrant Officer|warrant officer]].\n\nThe SCPO rank being the equivalent to Battalion or Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant causes some confusion when operating together with the Irish Army and Air Corps. The Quartermaster or logistical function is primary role of all BQMS/RQMS (OR-8) in the Irish Army and Air Corps. This is not so with the Irish Naval Service, many of their SCPOs (OR-8) have a purely line role. Line being the term used by the Irish Defence Forces to describe the default military role or non logistical role of the NCO. \n\nAll SCPOs have a specialist role such as Seaman, Engine Room Artificer, or Logistical Operator. There are only a very few Senior Chiefs, and they occupy roles of great importance within their respective branches. They are key members of the senior enlisted leadership, and are most often working directly for an Officer Commanding a large sub-unit as an advisor to Officer  Commanding and as a senior personnel manager.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Petty Officer|Petty officer]]\n* [[United States Navy enlisted rates|U.S. Navy enlisted rate insignia]]\n* [[Comparative military ranks]]\n\n{{US_enlisted_ranks}}\n\n[[Category:Military ranks of the United States Navy]]\n[[Category:Military ranks of the United States Coast Guard]]\n[[Category:United States military enlisted ranks]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Military rank}}\n'''Senior chief petty officer''' is an enlisted rank in the navies of some countries.\n\n==United States==\n{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n\n<div style=\"float:right; text-align:center; font-size:75%; margin:6px;\">\n[[Image:USCG SCPO Collar.png|76px]]<br />\nU.S. Coast Guard<br />senior chief<br />petty officer<br />collar device\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float:right; text-align:center; font-size:75%; margin:6px;\">\n[[Image:USCG SCPO.svg|70px|E-8 insignia]]<br />\nU.S. Coast Guard<br />senior chief<br />petty officer<br />insignia<br />\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float:right; text-align:center; font-size:75%; margin:6px;\">\n[[Image:SCPO collar.png|70px]]<br />\nSenior chief<br />petty officer<br />collar device\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float:right; text-align:center; font-size:75%; margin:6px;\">\n[[Image:U.S. Navy E8 shoulderboard.png|70px]]<br />\nSenior chief<br />petty officer<br />shoulderboard\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float:right; text-align:center; font-size:75%; margin:6px;\">\n[[Image:SCPO GC.png|70px|E-8 insignia]]<br />\n[[U.S. Navy Good Conduct Variation|Good conduct]]<br />variation<br />\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float:right; text-align:center; font-size:75%; margin:6px;\">\n[[Image:SCPO NOGC.png|70px|E-8 insignia]]<br />\nSenior chief<br />petty officer<br />insignia\n</div>\n\nSenior chief petty officer is the eighth of nine enlisted ranks in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]], just above [[Chief Petty Officer (United States)|chief petty officer]] and below [[master chief petty officer]], and is a [[noncommissioned officer]].  They are addressed as \"Senior Chief\" in most circumstances, or sometimes, less formally, as \"Senior\".\n\nAdvancement to senior chief petty officer is similar to that of chief petty officer. It carries requirements of time in service, superior evaluation scores, and peer review. In the Navy, it is the first promotion that is based entirely on proven leadership performance; test scores do not play a part. A chief petty officer can only advance to senior chief if a board of master chiefs approves, convened every year around March. Senior chief petty officers make up just 2.5% of the total enlisted force of the Navy and overall fall within the top 4% of the enlisted ranks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/517 |title=10 U.S.C. \u00a7 517 |publisher=law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>\n\nIn the Coast Guard, advancement to senior chief is similar to other advancements, in that candidates compete with other advancement-eligible chief petty officers.  Advancement-eligible chief petty officers are prioritized based on written examination scores, evaluations, award points, time in service, and time in grade.  Senior chief petty officers are then selected monthly from this prioritization list as positions become available.\n\nAs do chief petty officers, senior chief petty officers take on more advanced leadership duties in their new paygrade. In the Navy, their khaki uniform continues to reflect their responsibility level: It is similar to an officer's uniform, but with different insignia.  (In the Coast Guard, petty officers, chief petty officers, warrant officers, and commissioned officers all wear similar uniforms.)\n\nLike petty officers, every chief has both a rate (rank) and [[List of United States Navy ratings|rating]] (job, similar to an [[Military Occupational Specialty|MOS]] in other branches). A chief's full title is a combination of the two. Thus, a senior chief petty officer with the rating of machinist's mate would properly be called a senior chief machinist's mate, the abbreviation of which is ''MMCS''.\n\nEach rating has an official abbreviation, such as MM for machinist's mate, QM for quartermaster, and YN for yeoman.  The rating and the rate combined give the abbreviation of a senior chief's full title, such as BMCS for senior chief boatswain's mate. In the expanded form, the title of senior chief always precedes the rating. It is not uncommon practice to refer to a senior chief petty officer by this shorthand in all but the most formal correspondence (such as printing and inscription on awards).\n\nThe rating insignia for a senior chief is an eagle with spread wings above three chevrons. The chevrons are topped by a rocker that goes behind the eagle (or \"crow\", as it is commonly called). An inverted star (similar to the stars on the sleeves of line officers) is above the eagle. This is used on the dress blue uniform. On all other uniforms, the insignia used is the one that has become universally accepted as the symbol of the chief petty officer: a fouled (entwined in the anchor chain) gold anchor superimposed with a silver \"USN\" in the Navy or a silver shield in the Coast Guard. As in the dress blue insignia, the anchor is capped by an down-pointing star.\n\nIn the Navy, officers and chiefs are referred to as \"[[khakis]]\". This is a reference to the color of one of their most common uniforms and is a direct contrast to those in paygrades E-6 and below (\"blueshirts\").\n\n===Command senior chief petty officer===\n{{See also|Command master chief petty officer}}\nAs of 2005 and after a pilot program taking place on three mine countermeasures ships, the Navy started appointing senior chiefs to command roles. Until this time, senior chiefs had a senior enlisted leadership role in the submarine force as [[Chief of the Boat|chiefs of the boat]]. This new effort works to formalize leadership at the senior chief level. In July 2015, the rate was formally established as a rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=90372|title=Navy Announces Command Senior Chief Rating|first=This story was written by Chief of Naval|last=Personnel|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/navy-creates-new-command-senior-chief-rate-1.360530|title=Navy creates new command senior chief rate|publisher=}}</ref> Before it had been a billet instead of a rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2015/08/02/new-command-rating-announced-for-senior-chiefs/|title=New command rating announced for senior chiefs|first=Mark D.|last=Faram|date=22 August 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2016/NAV16210.txt</ref>\n\n==Ireland==\n\n===Irish Naval Service===\nSenior chief petty officer is also a rank in the [[Irish Naval Service]] ([[Gaeilge|Irish]]: ''Ard-Mhion-Oifigeach Sinsearach''). The rank is deemed equivalent to a member of the NATO armed forces ranked E-8, making it the equivalent of a senior chief petty officer in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] or a [[Warrant Officer Class 2#Royal Navy|warrant officer class 2]] in the [[Royal Navy]]. The rank is one grade below an Irish [[Warrant Officer|warrant officer]].\n\nThe SCPO rank being the equivalent to Battalion or Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant causes some confusion when operating together with the Irish Army and Air Corps.

The hook was used to grab fleeing criminals, and the rounded \"bill\" was used as a weapon. The rattle was a noise-making device used for calling for assistance.<ref>Taylor, J.

A fourteen-inch club replaced the old hook and bill, which had been in use for one hundred and fifty-four years. At the time of its founding, the Boston Police constituted one of the first paid, professional police services in the United States. The department was closely organized and modeled after [[Sir Robert Peel]]'s (London) [[Metropolitan Police Service]].<ref name=\"BPD Chronologist\" />\n\nOn November 3, 1851, the first Irish born Boston Police officer, Bernard \"Barney\" McGinniskin, was appointed. His presence generated considerable controversy. The ''[[Boston Pilot]]'' wrote, \"He is the first Irishman that ever carried the stick of a policeman anywhere in this country, and meetings, even [[Faneuil Hall]] meetings, have been held to protect against the appointment.\" At the time, the police salary of $2.00 a day for the morning and afternoon beat and $1.20 for the night watch was nearly twice as high as the wages of laborers. City Marshal Francis Tukey resisted mayor [[John Prescott Bigelow]]'s appointment of McGinniskin, expressing the predominant [[anti-Irish sentiment]]s in the city by arguing it was done at \"the expense of an American.\" On January 5, 1852, shortly before the newly elected mayor [[Benjamin Seaver]] (who had been supported by Tukey) took office, Tukey fired McGinniskin without giving a reason. After criticism in the press, Seaver reinstated McGinniskin, who remained in the police until the 1854 anti-Irish groundswell of the [[Know Nothing]]/American Party movement, when in the words of the ''Boston Pilot'', \"Mr. McGinniskin was discharged from the Boston Police for no other reason than he was a Catholic and born in Ireland.\" McGinniskin became a United States inspector at the customhouse and died of rheumatism on March 2, 1868.<ref>Peter F.

Hodsdon was patrolling the Corner of Havre and Maverick Street in East Boston. Hodsdon attempted to arrest two suspects for a burglary. A struggle ensued, and one of the suspects was able to get behind Hodsdon and shoot him in the head.  Hodsdon died about 10:00 A.M., becoming the first Boston police officer killed in the line of duty. He was 25 years old. The murderers fled. Thousands of people visited the station house to view the body. Hodsdon left behind his wife Lydia and infant son Ezekiel who was born just 13 days prior to his death. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Everett, according to ''Boston Globe'' newspaper reports on Oct 19, 1857.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/375-boston-police-department-massachusetts The Officer Down Memorial Page]</ref> On October 18, 2007, a memorial was held in honor of Hodsdon on the Corner of Havre and Maverick Streets in East Boston.<ref name=\"BPD Chronologist\" />\n\nIn 1871, the Boston Police Relief Association was founded.<ref name=\"BPD Chronologist\" />\n\nThe Boston Police Department appointed [[Horatio J.

This signaled a dramatic shift in traditional labor relations and views on the part of the police, who were unhappy with stagnant wages and poor working conditions. The city soon fell into riots and public chaos as over three-fourths of the department was no longer enforcing public peace. Governor [[Calvin Coolidge]] intervened to quash further chaos. Coolidge announced that the police did not have the right to strike against the public safety and brought in the state national guard to restore order to Boston. The strike was broken, permanently, when Coolidge hired replacement police officers, many of whom were returning servicemen from [[World War I]], and the former officers were refused re-entry into the department. Ironically, the new officers hired in the wake of the strike received higher salaries, more vacation days and city-provided uniforms, the very demands the original strikers were requesting. The BPD strike set a precedent for further movements to stymie police unionization around the country.<ref name=\"BPD Chronologist\"/>\n\nCoolidge's intervention in the strike brought him national fame, which, in turn, led to his nomination as [[Warren G. Harding|Harding's]] running mate for Vice-President in the 1920 presidential election.\n\nIn 1921, Irene McAuliffe, daughter of the late Weston police chief and horse breeder Patrick McAuliffe, was among the first six female members of the Boston Police Department. An accomplished horsewoman, she was sworn in as a mounted officer of the Weston Police Department in 1913 during the town's bicentennial celebration.

A fourteen-inch club replaced the old hook and bill, which had been in use for one hundred and fifty-four years. At the time of its founding, the Boston Police constituted one of the first paid, professional police services in the United States. The department was closely organized and modeled after [[Sir Robert Peel]]'s (London) [[Metropolitan Police Service]].<ref name=\"BPD Chronologist\" />\n\nOn November 3, 1851, the first Irish born Boston Police officer, Bernard \"Barney\" McGinniskin, was appointed. His presence generated considerable controversy. The ''[[Boston Pilot]]'' wrote, \"He is the first Irishman that ever carried the stick of a policeman anywhere in this country, and meetings, even [[Faneuil Hall]] meetings, have been held to protect against the appointment.\" At the time, the police salary of $2.00 a day for the morning and afternoon beat and $1.20 for the night watch was nearly twice as high as the wages of laborers. City Marshal Francis Tukey resisted mayor [[John Prescott Bigelow]]'s appointment of McGinniskin, expressing the predominant [[anti-Irish sentiment]]s in the city by arguing it was done at \"the expense of an American.\" On January 5, 1852, shortly before the newly elected mayor [[Benjamin Seaver]] (who had been supported by Tukey) took office, Tukey fired McGinniskin without giving a reason. After criticism in the press, Seaver reinstated McGinniskin, who remained in the police until the 1854 anti-Irish groundswell of the [[Know Nothing]]/American Party movement, when in the words of the ''Boston Pilot'', \"Mr. McGinniskin was discharged from the Boston Police for no other reason than he was a Catholic and born in Ireland.\" McGinniskin became a United States inspector at the customhouse and died of rheumatism on March 2, 1868.<ref>Peter F.

Hodsdon was patrolling the Corner of Havre and Maverick Street in East Boston. Hodsdon attempted to arrest two suspects for a burglary. A struggle ensued, and one of the suspects was able to get behind Hodsdon and shoot him in the head.  Hodsdon died about 10:00 A.M., becoming the first Boston police officer killed in the line of duty. He was 25 years old. The murderers fled. Thousands of people visited the station house to view the body. Hodsdon left behind his wife Lydia and infant son Ezekiel who was born just 13 days prior to his death. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Everett, according to ''Boston Globe'' newspaper reports on Oct 19, 1857.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/375-boston-police-department-massachusetts The Officer Down Memorial Page]</ref> On October 18, 2007, a memorial was held in honor of Hodsdon on the Corner of Havre and Maverick Streets in East Boston.<ref name=\"BPD Chronologist\" />\n\nIn 1871, the Boston Police Relief Association was founded.<ref name=\"BPD Chronologist\" />\n\nThe Boston Police Department appointed [[Horatio J. Homer]], its first African American officer, on December 24, 1878.  He was promoted to sergeant in 1895.  Sgt. Homer retired on Jan 29, 1919 after 40 years of service. He and his wife, Lydia Spriggs Homer, are buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Brighton, MA.<ref>Information Taken from Boston Police Commissioner Order on January 29, 1919 online at the BPL.</ref> On June 26, 2010, the Boston Police Department dedicated a gravestone in honor of Sgt. Homer's service.<ref name=\"BPD Chronologist\" />\n\n===20th century===\n{{Main|Boston Police Strike}}\nOn September 9, 1919, when Police Commissioner [[Edwin Upton Curtis]] refused to allow the creation of a police union, 1,117 BPD officers went on strike. This signaled a dramatic shift in traditional labor relations and views on the part of the police, who were unhappy with stagnant wages and poor working conditions. The city soon fell into riots and public chaos as over three-fourths of the department was no longer enforcing public peace. Governor [[Calvin Coolidge]] intervened to quash further chaos. Coolidge announced that the police did not have the right to strike against the public safety and brought in the state national guard to restore order to Boston. The strike was broken, permanently, when Coolidge hired replacement police officers, many of whom were returning servicemen from [[World War I]], and the former officers were refused re-entry into the department. Ironically, the new officers hired in the wake of the strike received higher salaries, more vacation days and city-provided uniforms, the very demands the original strikers were requesting. The BPD strike set a precedent for further movements to stymie police unionization around the country.<ref name=\"BPD Chronologist\"/>\n\nCoolidge's intervention in the strike brought him national fame, which, in turn, led to his nomination as [[Warren G. Harding|Harding's]] running mate for Vice-President in the 1920 presidential election.\n\nIn 1921, Irene McAuliffe, daughter of the late Weston police chief and horse breeder Patrick McAuliffe, was among the first six female members of the Boston Police Department. An accomplished horsewoman, she was sworn in as a mounted officer of the Weston Police Department in 1913 during the town's bicentennial celebration. She joined the District of Columbia Police Department in 1920, and in 1921 she became a member of the Boston Police Department's Vice Squad.<ref name=\"BPD Chronologist\"/><ref>Boston Police Archives & Commissioner Orders</ref>\n\n====Busing crisis====\n{{Main|Boston busing crisis}}\nIn 1974 and 1975, the BPD was involved in maintaining order during the public disturbance over court-ordered [[desegregation busing|busing]], which was intended to racially desegregate Boston's public school system.<ref name=brief/><ref name=time1975>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917826,00.html Boston: Preparing for the Worst] Time.
