Across the parliamentary and borough boundary to the south-east lies [[Twickenham]]. Feltham & Heston shares the London Borough of Hounslow with the [[Brentford and Isleworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Brentford and Isleworth]] parliamentary constituency.\n\nThe constituency comprises ten [[electoral wards]] of the Borough of Hounslow: Bedfont, Cranford, Feltham North, Feltham West, Hanworth, Hanworth Park, Heston Central, Heston East, Heston West, and Hounslow West.\n\n==Constituency profile==\nMost parts of the Feltham and Heston constituency are lower on the socio-economic scale than those in neighbouring Brentford and Isleworth. There is a higher proportion of social housing, though unemployment is low by London standards. The seat also includes parts of Hounslow itself.\n\nTo the North and West, just over the border in the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]], is [[London Heathrow Airport]] where many local constituents are employed, while there is considerable small industry in the Heston area.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The constituency includes a [[Feltham (HM Prison)|Young Offenders Institution]] and a [[Heston services|motorway service station]].\n\n==Candidates==\nThe candidature deadline was 30 November 2011.<ref>[http://www.hounslow.gov.uk/index/council_and_democracy/elections/by_elections.htm Feltham and Heston by-election] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501191555/http://www.hounslow.gov.uk/index/council_and_democracy/elections/by_elections.htm |date=2012-05-01 }} London Borough of Hounslow</ref><ref>[http://www.hounslow.gov.uk/statement_persons_nominated.pdf]{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn 24 November 2011, the [[UK Independence Party]] chose [[Andrew Charalambous]],<ref>{{cite web |title=UKIP chooses by-election candidate |url=http://www.ukip.org/content/latest-news/2551-ukip-chooses-byelection-candidate |publisher=UK Independence Party |accessdate=24 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126205647/http://www.ukip.org/content/latest-news/2551-ukip-chooses-byelection-candidate |archivedate=26 November 2011 }}</ref> a former nightclub owner and Conservative Party electoral candidate.{{cn|date=April 2020}} The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate was named as Hounslow Councillor Mark Bowen on the same day.<ref>[http://bowenblog.wordpress.com/ Bowen's Blog] Mark Bowen personal blog</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/ToryPressHQ/statuses/139812877602271233] ToryHQ Twitter feed</ref>\n\nLabour chose Seema Malhotra<ref>[http://labourlist.org/2011/11/feltham-and-heston-candidate-selected/] LabourList</ref> as their candidate on 27 November 2011 after a quickfire selection<ref>[http://labourlist.org/2011/11/quickfire-selection-process-for-feltham-and-heston-revealed/] LabourList</ref> from four other candidates.

Whilst a low turnout is generally expected at by-elections, such a low turnout surprised many experts who attributed it to a couple of main factors: the relatively short space of time between the death of the sitting MP (Alan Keen) and the by-election, only 35 days in this case when the average since 1979 is 73;<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16214243 | work=BBC News | title=What lessons from Feltham and Heston by-election? | date=16 December 2011}}</ref> and the time of year, as it was held close to Christmas and during the long and cold winter nights.

[[Feltham]] lies in the western half of the constituency, [[Heston]] in the north. At the south of the constituency lies [[Hanworth]], with [[Bedfont]] in the west. Across the parliamentary and borough boundary to the south-east lies [[Twickenham]]. Feltham & Heston shares the London Borough of Hounslow with the [[Brentford and Isleworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Brentford and Isleworth]] parliamentary constituency.\n\nThe constituency comprises ten [[electoral wards]] of the Borough of Hounslow: Bedfont, Cranford, Feltham North, Feltham West, Hanworth, Hanworth Park, Heston Central, Heston East, Heston West, and Hounslow West.\n\n==Constituency profile==\nMost parts of the Feltham and Heston constituency are lower on the socio-economic scale than those in neighbouring Brentford and Isleworth. There is a higher proportion of social housing, though unemployment is low by London standards. The seat also includes parts of Hounslow itself.\n\nTo the North and West, just over the border in the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]], is [[London Heathrow Airport]] where many local constituents are employed, while there is considerable small industry in the Heston area.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The constituency includes a [[Feltham (HM Prison)|Young Offenders Institution]] and a [[Heston services|motorway service station]].\n\n==Candidates==\nThe candidature deadline was 30 November 2011.<ref>[http://www.hounslow.gov.uk/index/council_and_democracy/elections/by_elections.htm Feltham and Heston by-election] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501191555/http://www.hounslow.gov.uk/index/council_and_democracy/elections/by_elections.htm |date=2012-05-01 }} London Borough of Hounslow</ref><ref>[http://www.hounslow.gov.uk/statement_persons_nominated.pdf]{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn 24 November 2011, the [[UK Independence Party]] chose [[Andrew Charalambous]],<ref>{{cite web |title=UKIP chooses by-election candidate |url=http://www.ukip.org/content/latest-news/2551-ukip-chooses-byelection-candidate |publisher=UK Independence Party |accessdate=24 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126205647/http://www.ukip.org/content/latest-news/2551-ukip-chooses-byelection-candidate |archivedate=26 November 2011 }}</ref> a former nightclub owner and Conservative Party electoral candidate.{{cn|date=April 2020}} The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate was named as Hounslow Councillor Mark Bowen on the same day.<ref>[http://bowenblog.wordpress.com/ Bowen's Blog] Mark Bowen personal blog</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/ToryPressHQ/statuses/139812877602271233] ToryHQ Twitter feed</ref>\n\nLabour chose Seema Malhotra<ref>[http://labourlist.org/2011/11/feltham-and-heston-candidate-selected/] LabourList</ref> as their candidate on 27 November 2011 after a quickfire selection<ref>[http://labourlist.org/2011/11/quickfire-selection-process-for-feltham-and-heston-revealed/] LabourList</ref> from four other candidates.

Whilst a low turnout is generally expected at by-elections, such a low turnout surprised many experts who attributed it to a couple of main factors: the relatively short space of time between the death of the sitting MP (Alan Keen) and the by-election, only 35 days in this case when the average since 1979 is 73;<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16214243 | work=BBC News | title=What lessons from Feltham and Heston by-election? | date=16 December 2011}}</ref> and the time of year, as it was held close to Christmas and during the long and cold winter nights.

Weezer's second album, ''[[Pinkerton (album)|Pinkerton]]'' (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but went on to achieve [[cult following|cult status]] and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and ''Pinkerton'' are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for ''Pinkerton'', bassist [[Matt Sharp]] left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.\n\nIn 2001, Weezer returned with the \"[[Weezer (Green Album)|Green Album]]\", with new bassist [[Mikey Welsh]]. With a more pop sound, and promoted by singles \"[[Hash Pipe]]\" and \"[[Island in the Sun (Weezer song)|Island in the Sun]]\", the album was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left the band and was replaced by current bassist [[Scott Shriner]]. Weezer's fourth album, ''[[Maladroit]]'' (2002), achieved mostly positive reviews, but weaker sales. ''[[Make Believe (Weezer album)|Make Believe]]'' (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single \"[[Beverly Hills (song)|Beverly Hills]]\" became Weezer's first single to top the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and the first to reach the top ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].\n\nIn 2008, Weezer released the \"[[Weezer (Red Album)|Red Album]]\", featuring \"[[Roland TR-808|TR-808s]], synths, [[Southern rap]], and [[baroque]] counterpoint\".<ref name=\"PFRiversinterview\">{{cite web |last=Crock |first=Jason |date=2008-01-28 |title=Interview: Rivers Cuomo |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/6773-rivers-cuomo/ |accessdate=2017-06-25}}</ref> Its lead single, \"[[Pork and Beans (song)|Pork and Beans]]\", became the third Weezer song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a  [[Grammy]]-winning YouTube music video.

Cuomo had what he then described as a \"massive falling out\" with the label. In early 2002, well before the official release of the album, the label sent out a letter to radio stations requesting the song be pulled until an official, sanctioned single was released. Interscope also briefly shut down Weezer's audio/video download webpage, removing all the MP3 demos. Online Weezer fans staged a brief protest, with several websites proclaiming \"Free ''Maladroit''\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nIn April 2002, former bassist Matt Sharp sued the band, alleging, among several accusations, that he was owed money for cowriting several Weezer songs. The suit was later settled out of court.<ref name=\"allm\"/>\n\nThe fourth album, ''[[Maladroit]]'', was released on May 14, 2002, only one year after its predecessor. The album served as a harder-edged version of the band's trademark catchy pop-influenced music, and was replete with busy 1980s-style guitar solos. Although met with generally positive critical reviews, its sales were not as strong as those for the Green Album. Two singles were released from the album. The music video for \"[[Dope Nose]]\" featured an obscure [[B\u014ds\u014dzoku|Japanese motorcycle gang]], and was put into regular rotation. The music video for \"[[Keep Fishin']]\" combined Weezer with [[the Muppets]], and had heavy rotation on MTV. Both videos were directed by Marcos Siega.\n\nWeezer released its much-delayed first DVD on March 23, 2004. The ''[[Weezer \u2013 Video Capture Device: Treasures from the Vault 1991\u20132002|Video Capture Device]]'' DVD chronicles the band from its beginnings through ''[[Maladroit]]'''s Enlightenment Tour. Compiled by Karl Koch, the DVD features home video footage, music videos, commercials, rehearsals, concert performances, television performances, and band commentary.

Despite commercial success, ''Make Believe'' got a mixed reception from critics, receiving an average score of 52 on review collator [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"Metacritic MakeBelieve\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/weezer/makebelieve?q=Make%20Believe |title=Weezer: Make Believe |accessdate=2007-05-30 |work=metacritic |publisher=metacritic }}</ref> Although some reviews, such as AMG's, compared it favorably to ''Pinkerton'',<ref name=\"AMG\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r738466|pure_url=yes}} |title= Make Believe: Review |accessdate=2007-05-30 |last= Erlewine |first= Stephen |agency= allmusic |publisher=AMG }}</ref> others, among them ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', panned the album as predictable and lyrically poor.\n\nThe album's first single, \"[[Beverly Hills (song)|Beverly Hills]]\", became a hit in the U.S. and worldwide, staying on the charts for several months after its release. It became the first Weezer song to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. \"Beverly Hills\" was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 48th Annual [[Grammy Awards]], the first ever Grammy nomination for the band. The video was also nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. The second single released from ''Make Believe'' was \"[[We Are All on Drugs]]\". MTV refused to play the song, so Weezer re-recorded the lyrics by replacing \"on drugs\" with \"in love\" and renaming the song \"We Are All in Love\". In early 2006, it was announced that ''Make Believe'' was [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]], and \"Beverly Hills\" was the second most popular song download on iTunes for 2005, finishing just behind \"[[Hollaback Girl]]\" by [[Gwen Stefani]].<ref>{{cite web\n | last = Koch\n | first = Karl\n | title = breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch\n |date=2006-01-18\n | url = http://www.weezer.com/community/news_comment.asp?ParentAssetID=1378551&ArtistID=479&Start=&FullStory=Y&type=\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061129185644/http://www.weezer.com/community/news_comment.asp?ParentAssetID=1378551&ArtistID=479&Start=&FullStory=Y&type=\n | archivedate = 2006-11-29\n | accessdate = 2006-11-03 }}</ref> ''Make Believe'''s third single, \"[[Perfect Situation]]\", spent four weeks in a row at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. \"[[This Is Such a Pity]]\" was the band's fourth single from the album, but no music video was made for its release.

At a show in Austin, after Tokyo Police Club had played its set, Cuomo was wheeled out in a box and mimed to a recording of rare Weezer demo, \"My Brain\", dressed in pajamas and with puppets on his hands, before being wheeled off again.

Since 2001, the band has consisted of [[Rivers Cuomo]] (lead vocals, lead guitar, keyboards), [[Patrick Wilson (musician)|Patrick Wilson]] (drums), [[Brian Bell]] (guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), and [[Scott Shriner]] (bass, backing vocals).\n\nAfter signing to [[Geffen Records]] in 1993, Weezer released its self-titled debut album, also known as the \"[[Weezer (Blue Album)|Blue Album]]\", in 1994. Backed by music videos for the singles \"[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]\", \"[[Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song]]\", and \"[[Say It Ain't So]]\", the Blue Album became a [[multiplatinum]] success. Weezer's second album, ''[[Pinkerton (album)|Pinkerton]]'' (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but went on to achieve [[cult following|cult status]] and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and ''Pinkerton'' are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for ''Pinkerton'', bassist [[Matt Sharp]] left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.\n\nIn 2001, Weezer returned with the \"[[Weezer (Green Album)|Green Album]]\", with new bassist [[Mikey Welsh]]. With a more pop sound, and promoted by singles \"[[Hash Pipe]]\" and \"[[Island in the Sun (Weezer song)|Island in the Sun]]\", the album was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left the band and was replaced by current bassist [[Scott Shriner]]. Weezer's fourth album, ''[[Maladroit]]'' (2002), achieved mostly positive reviews, but weaker sales. ''[[Make Believe (Weezer album)|Make Believe]]'' (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single \"[[Beverly Hills (song)|Beverly Hills]]\" became Weezer's first single to top the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and the first to reach the top ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].\n\nIn 2008, Weezer released the \"[[Weezer (Red Album)|Red Album]]\", featuring \"[[Roland TR-808|TR-808s]], synths, [[Southern rap]], and [[baroque]] counterpoint\".<ref name=\"PFRiversinterview\">{{cite web |last=Crock |first=Jason |date=2008-01-28 |title=Interview: Rivers Cuomo |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/6773-rivers-cuomo/ |accessdate=2017-06-25}}</ref> Its lead single, \"[[Pork and Beans (song)|Pork and Beans]]\", became the third Weezer song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a  [[Grammy]]-winning YouTube music video.

Shortly after the release, Weezer went on another American tour.

Cuomo eventually delegated song selection for the album to the band's original A&R rep, [http://weezerpedia.com/wiki/Todd_Sullivan Todd Sullivan], saying that Weezer fans chose the \"wackest songs\".

Cuomo had what he then described as a \"massive falling out\" with the label. In early 2002, well before the official release of the album, the label sent out a letter to radio stations requesting the song be pulled until an official, sanctioned single was released. Interscope also briefly shut down Weezer's audio/video download webpage, removing all the MP3 demos. Online Weezer fans staged a brief protest, with several websites proclaiming \"Free ''Maladroit''\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nIn April 2002, former bassist Matt Sharp sued the band, alleging, among several accusations, that he was owed money for cowriting several Weezer songs. The suit was later settled out of court.<ref name=\"allm\"/>\n\nThe fourth album, ''[[Maladroit]]'', was released on May 14, 2002, only one year after its predecessor. The album served as a harder-edged version of the band's trademark catchy pop-influenced music, and was replete with busy 1980s-style guitar solos. Although met with generally positive critical reviews, its sales were not as strong as those for the Green Album. Two singles were released from the album. The music video for \"[[Dope Nose]]\" featured an obscure [[B\u014ds\u014dzoku|Japanese motorcycle gang]], and was put into regular rotation. The music video for \"[[Keep Fishin']]\" combined Weezer with [[the Muppets]], and had heavy rotation on MTV. Both videos were directed by Marcos Siega.\n\nWeezer released its much-delayed first DVD on March 23, 2004. The ''[[Weezer \u2013 Video Capture Device: Treasures from the Vault 1991\u20132002|Video Capture Device]]'' DVD chronicles the band from its beginnings through ''[[Maladroit]]'''s Enlightenment Tour. Compiled by Karl Koch, the DVD features home video footage, music videos, commercials, rehearsals, concert performances, television performances, and band commentary.

The band's early recording efforts became available to the public through the band's website. The demos were a big hit, but none of the songs recorded at this time were included on the finished album. That album, titled ''[[Make Believe (Weezer album)|Make Believe]],'' was released on May 10, 2005.

It became the first Weezer song to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. \"Beverly Hills\" was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 48th Annual [[Grammy Awards]], the first ever Grammy nomination for the band. The video was also nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. The second single released from ''Make Believe'' was \"[[We Are All on Drugs]]\". MTV refused to play the song, so Weezer re-recorded the lyrics by replacing \"on drugs\" with \"in love\" and renaming the song \"We Are All in Love\". In early 2006, it was announced that ''Make Believe'' was [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]], and \"Beverly Hills\" was the second most popular song download on iTunes for 2005, finishing just behind \"[[Hollaback Girl]]\" by [[Gwen Stefani]].<ref>{{cite web\n | last = Koch\n | first = Karl\n | title = breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch\n |date=2006-01-18\n | url = http://www.weezer.com/community/news_comment.asp?ParentAssetID=1378551&ArtistID=479&Start=&FullStory=Y&type=\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061129185644/http://www.weezer.com/community/news_comment.asp?ParentAssetID=1378551&ArtistID=479&Start=&FullStory=Y&type=\n | archivedate = 2006-11-29\n | accessdate = 2006-11-03 }}</ref> ''Make Believe'''s third single, \"[[Perfect Situation]]\", spent four weeks in a row at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. \"[[This Is Such a Pity]]\" was the band's fourth single from the album, but no music video was made for its release.

[[Angels and Airwaves]] and [[Tokyo Police Club]] joined the band as support at each show, and Brian Bell's \"other\"band [[The Relationship]] also performed at a handful of dates.

At a show in Austin, after Tokyo Police Club had played its set, Cuomo was wheeled out in a box and mimed to a recording of rare Weezer demo, \"My Brain\", dressed in pajamas and with puppets on his hands, before being wheeled off again.

As a result of their precarious legal and social situation, these people are hesitant to identify themselves as being unauthorized, and the process of estimating statistics and drawing conclusions can be lengthy and cumbersome. While exact numbers are not known, there has been an increased emphasis on the challenges facing undocumented students nationwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=23+Geo.+Immigr.+L.J.+403&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=f8bd301fa241168c5b4b4b16b5f35dff|title=Is Postsecondary Access for Undocumented Immigrants an Important Right?

This specific act prevents schools from releasing any information from students' records to immigration authorities<ref name=\":8\" />.  [[Graduation]] for these youth serves as a traumatic change in status and identity from student to \"illegal alien\" and \"illegal worker\". This \"state of shock\" causes depressed motivation and financial anxiety causing youth to drop out of high school. 40 percent of undocumented adults ages 18\u201324 do not complete high school. Of those that complete high school, only 49 percent attend college. Many youths reported a feeling of falling through the cracks, instances where they were not able to get assistance from their educational institutions.<ref name=\"Gonzales\" />  The inability to receive federal and state [[Student financial aid (United States)|student financial aid]], as well as low family incomes, limits access for undocumented youth to attend post secondary schooling.<ref>Greenman, Emily, and Matthew Hall. \"Legal Status And Educational Transitions For Mexican And Central American Immigrant Youth\".

Graduating college allows youth to improve labor market skills and makes them eligible for jobs where employers might potentially sponsor a temporary legal visa. A college education also increases youth marriageability increasing the chances for youth to marry a legal citizen and obtain legal status through familial relationship.<ref name=\"Kaushal\" />\nThe majority of undocumented children are growing up with legal access to public education but face legal barriers to higher education (Abrego, 2006). Abrego interviewed a girl named Alisa who came to the United States at the age of five from Guatemala; she encountered the difficulties of higher education. She was a student who excelled academically in high school and was admitted to the University of California. Alisa became disheartened due to her status and was unable to be given financial aid. Some researchers explain that undocumented children face an economic barrier when pursuing a higher education and find that because of this they are unable to attend a University (Abrego; Shields and Behrman, 2004; Gonzales, 2011; Crosnoe and Turley, 2011). Due to this, The Dream Act was proposed to the Senate and the House of Representatives and was only 13 states that include California, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin passed their state laws. These states allow undocumented children to pay in-state tuition based on their attendance and graduation from a state high school (Schmid 2013).\n\n==Higher education==\nThe Pew Hispanic Center estimates that 1.5 million undocumented students currently reside in the United States.<ref>Passel, Cohn 2009, p. ii.</ref>  Of these students, about 765,000 arrived in the United States before turning sixteen.<ref name=\"UnauthorizedYouth\">{{Cite journal\n  |author=Jeanne Batalova, Michael Fix\n  | title = New Estimates of Unauthorized Youth Eligible for Legal Status under the DREAM Act\n  | journal = Migration Policy Institute Immigration Backgrounder\n  | issue =  1\n  | date = Oct 2006\n  | url = http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/Backgrounder1_Dream_Act.pdf }}</ref> It is also estimated that there were 360,000 undocumented high school graduates between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four in the United States in 2006.<ref name=\"UnauthorizedYouth\"/>  However, it is estimated that each year only 5 to 10 percent of undocumented high-school graduates\u2014about 65,000 nationwide\u2014are eligible to attend college.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Passel\n  | first = Jeffrey S.\n  | title = Further demographics information relating to DREAM Act\n  | publisher = Urban Institute\n  | date = Oct 2003\n  | url = http://www.nilc.org/immlaw-policy/DREAM/DREAM_Demographics.pdf }}</ref> In 2005, only about 50,000 undocumented students enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities.<ref name=\"WastedTalent\">{{Cite journal\n  | last = Gonzales\n  | first = Roberto\n  | title = Wasted Talent and Broken Dreams: The Lost Potential of Undocumented Students\n  | journal = 5 in Focus\n  | issue = 13\n  | date = Oct 2007\n  | url = http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/index.php?content=f071001 }}</ref>  Of these college students, 18,000 were enrolled in California community colleges in the 2005-2006 school year as a result of financial accessibility.<ref name=\"WastedTalent\"/> According to Roberto Gonzalez, Professor of Sociology at the University of Washington, \"Given the opportunity to receive additional education and move into better-paying jobs, undocumented students would pay more in taxes and have more money to spend and invest in the U.S. economy.\"\n\n===Admission & enrollment===\nThere is no federal law that prohibits the admission of undocumented immigrants to U.S. colleges and universities, public or private, nor does federal law require students to prove citizenship in order to enter U.S. institutions of higher education.<ref name=\"AdvisingUndocumentedStudents\">{{Cite web\n  | title = Advising Undocumented Students\n  | publisher = The College Board\n  | url = http://professionals.collegeboard.com/guidance/financial-aid/undocumented-students| date = 2007-09-07\n  }}</ref>  However, every institution has its own policies on admitting undocumented students.

The language in both PRWORA and IIRIRA are vague enough that they allow states to decide how to address tuition rates and state financial aid for their students.

Most undocumented students come from working class or working poor families, which often forces them to live in communities where they become vulnerable to crimes, poor housing conditions, high unemployment, and underperforming schools<ref name=\":6\" /> Many of the schools they attend face high teacher turnover, overcrowding, and inadequate teacher preparation.  Many of the students are placed into language development courses, which often do not provide the rigorous coursework needed for college preparation.<ref name=\":6\" /> These students also may struggle with their schoolwork due to the discontinuity in their education.  Some students arrive in the United States after attending schools in their country of birth.  Adjusting to the education system in the United States can be a challenge for students. Some may be behind because their previous schools were not teaching the same curriculum or if their schools were ahead of the curriculum, students might lose interest in their new schools. Undocumented students can also struggle with their need to contribute money to their household.  Some students work as migrant farmers alongside their parents, this economic need can set them back in their education and in their path to understanding the steps to higher education.<ref name=\":6\" /> All of these things can inhibit undocumented students from successfully preparing for higher education.\n\nAnother barrier undocumented students face in their access to higher education is the lack of resources and adequate support from school professionals.  Many school professionals\u2014teachers, counselors, other personnel\u2014are not always aware of their state's policies regarding admission, tuition and financial aid for undocumented students.  Some school professionals are even unaware which students on their campus are undocumented. School professionals, often, do not receive training about policies that affect students and some have acknowledged that they only learned because of interactions with students or what they have learned through the media.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Lad|first=Kaetlyn|last2=Braganza|first2=Desiree|title=Increasing Knowledge Related to the Experiences of Undocumented Immigrants in Public Schools|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=EJ1013134|journal=Educational Leadership and Administration: Teaching and Program Development|language=en|volume=24|pages=1\u201315|issn=1064-4474|date=2012-12-31}}</ref> Some undocumented students, who have been surveyed regarding their educational experience, claimed to feel as if they \"lucked out\", having someone to mentor them in college access.<ref name=\":7\" /> Unfortunately, not all students feel this way.

Many parents of undocumented students do not have the knowledge to help their child pursue higher education, but these families have strong family networks, and with accurate information, students will then be able to share it with the younger children in their networks.  If community groups and school professionals reach out to undocumented students in ways that work within their culture, these students can have in increased chance of attending higher education.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==Employment and transitions into adulthood==\nYouth brought to the United States as adolescents are at greater risk for adjustment difficulties. Many undergo acculturated distress; poor mental health, depression, anxiety, a feeling of alienation, and identity confusion.<ref>Ellis, Lauren M., and Eric C. Chen. \"Negotiating Identity Development Among Undocumented Immigrant College Students: A Grounded Theory Study.\" Journal of Counseling Psychology 60.2 (2013): 251-264. PsycARTICLES. Web. 10 November 2013.</ref> Markers in the transition into adulthood, such as finding work, applying for college, and obtaining a driver's license, all require legal status to obtain. Youth undergo three transition periods as they enter into adulthood; discovery, learning to be undocumented, and coping. The first, discovery (ages 16\u201318) is the time where youth first discover that they are undocumented. Within this period, key transitional markers such as obtaining a driver's license and applying for college are experienced. These markers often become the first time many youth learn that they are undocumented.  The second period, learning to be undocumented (ages 18\u201324) is a series of life alterations in which youth learn to live as an undocumented immigrant. This includes finding work as an undocumented immigrant and postponing secondary education. The third, coping (ages 25\u201329) is adjusting to lower expectations and realizing the true limits of their rights. This leads many youth to follow into the same job pool as their undocumented parents.<ref name=\"Gonzales\" />\n\nThis gap still exists between higher education and financial aid for undocumented students. Since undocumented students are not eligible for most forms of financial aid, merit scholarships are not feasible as they are most often restrict their eligibility to U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Undocumented students are not eligible for federal aid, thus, benefits that come from FAFSA or Pell Grants do not apply to these students.  Most state-based aid is also out of reach for undocumented students so grants, work study and loans are not options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e4fc.org/images/Fact_Sheet.pdf|title=Fact Sheet: An Overview of College-Bound Undocumented Students|publisher=Educators for Fair Consideration|date=1 January 2012|access-date=21 April 2015}}</ref> States opt to pass their own legislation allowing in-state tuition for undocumented students; while this is an important step for undocumented students, it does not fully bridge the gap for financial aid.

In general, 86% of all respondents also participated in extracurricular activities during high school. In addition to college, 55% participated in some form of civic engagement. Even though undocumented Latino students had a high percentage in civic engagement, they also reported higher levels of feeling rejection because of their undocumented status.

Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States struck down a state statute denying funding for education to undocumented immigrant children. The case simultaneously struck down a municipal school district's attempt to charge such immigrants an annual $1,000 tuition fee to compensate for state funding.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Court found that where states limit the rights afforded to people (specifically children) based on their status as immigrants, this limitation must be examined under an intermediate scrutiny standard to determine whether it furthers a substantial goal of the State.\n\nPrior to 1975, all students in Texas were able to attend public elementary and secondary school. The state government provided funding to schools based on the number of students enrolled. In May 1975, the state legislature amended the Texas Education Code to provide that only U.S. citizens or lawfully admitted noncitizens would be counted for financial aid purposes.<ref>Lopez, Lopez 2010, p. 16.</ref>  Schools were given the option to allow or reject undocumented students and to charge tuition if they chose to accept them.

Neither is true, the deferment only provides the qualified recipients to have a lawful presence, meaning the authorities cannot force them to leave the country although they still lack legal immigration status.  DACA statuses can be terminated or not renewed based on the discretion of DHS, as it is not a law.

The DREAM Act initially allowed beneficiaries to qualify for federal student aid but was changed in the 2010 version of the bill. In order to be eligible, individuals must have come to the U.S. as children (under the age of 16), graduated from a U.S. high school and be a long-term resident (at least 5 years). An age cap of 35 was also set. The latest version of the DREAM Act does not grant legal immigrant status to anyone for at least two years.

A lot of undocumented students have issues with certain people they can trust within their community. Based on their status of being considered an alien in the United States they feel secluded. Undocumented immigrants feel as though they don't belong in the United States that because of how people treat them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.undocuscholars.org/assets/undocuscholarsreport2015.pdf|title=In the Shadows of the Ivory Tower: Undocumented Unddergraduates tionand the Liminal States of Immigration Reform|last=Teranishi|first=Robert|date=2014}}</ref>\n\nUndocumented immigrants, particularly students, are a difficult subgroup of the population to research; there is not much current statistical data available. As a result of their precarious legal and social situation, these people are hesitant to identify themselves as being unauthorized, and the process of estimating statistics and drawing conclusions can be lengthy and cumbersome. While exact numbers are not known, there has been an increased emphasis on the challenges facing undocumented students nationwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=23+Geo.+Immigr.+L.J.+403&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=f8bd301fa241168c5b4b4b16b5f35dff|title=Is Postsecondary Access for Undocumented Immigrants an Important Right?

The cultural expectations of immigrants in these communities often influence a more silenced and hidden existence than other cultures.

This specific act prevents schools from releasing any information from students' records to immigration authorities<ref name=\":8\" />.  [[Graduation]] for these youth serves as a traumatic change in status and identity from student to \"illegal alien\" and \"illegal worker\". This \"state of shock\" causes depressed motivation and financial anxiety causing youth to drop out of high school. 40 percent of undocumented adults ages 18\u201324 do not complete high school. Of those that complete high school, only 49 percent attend college. Many youths reported a feeling of falling through the cracks, instances where they were not able to get assistance from their educational institutions.<ref name=\"Gonzales\" />  The inability to receive federal and state [[Student financial aid (United States)|student financial aid]], as well as low family incomes, limits access for undocumented youth to attend post secondary schooling.<ref>Greenman, Emily, and Matthew Hall. \"Legal Status And Educational Transitions For Mexican And Central American Immigrant Youth\".

Graduating college allows youth to improve labor market skills and makes them eligible for jobs where employers might potentially sponsor a temporary legal visa. A college education also increases youth marriageability increasing the chances for youth to marry a legal citizen and obtain legal status through familial relationship.<ref name=\"Kaushal\" />\nThe majority of undocumented children are growing up with legal access to public education but face legal barriers to higher education (Abrego, 2006). Abrego interviewed a girl named Alisa who came to the United States at the age of five from Guatemala; she encountered the difficulties of higher education. She was a student who excelled academically in high school and was admitted to the University of California. Alisa became disheartened due to her status and was unable to be given financial aid. Some researchers explain that undocumented children face an economic barrier when pursuing a higher education and find that because of this they are unable to attend a University (Abrego; Shields and Behrman, 2004; Gonzales, 2011; Crosnoe and Turley, 2011). Due to this, The Dream Act was proposed to the Senate and the House of Representatives and was only 13 states that include California, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin passed their state laws. These states allow undocumented children to pay in-state tuition based on their attendance and graduation from a state high school (Schmid 2013).\n\n==Higher education==\nThe Pew Hispanic Center estimates that 1.5 million undocumented students currently reside in the United States.<ref>Passel, Cohn 2009, p. ii.</ref>  Of these students, about 765,000 arrived in the United States before turning sixteen.<ref name=\"UnauthorizedYouth\">{{Cite journal\n  |author=Jeanne Batalova, Michael Fix\n  | title = New Estimates of Unauthorized Youth Eligible for Legal Status under the DREAM Act\n  | journal = Migration Policy Institute Immigration Backgrounder\n  | issue =  1\n  | date = Oct 2006\n  | url = http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/Backgrounder1_Dream_Act.pdf }}</ref> It is also estimated that there were 360,000 undocumented high school graduates between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four in the United States in 2006.<ref name=\"UnauthorizedYouth\"/>  However, it is estimated that each year only 5 to 10 percent of undocumented high-school graduates\u2014about 65,000 nationwide\u2014are eligible to attend college.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Passel\n  | first = Jeffrey S.\n  | title = Further demographics information relating to DREAM Act\n  | publisher = Urban Institute\n  | date = Oct 2003\n  | url = http://www.nilc.org/immlaw-policy/DREAM/DREAM_Demographics.pdf }}</ref> In 2005, only about 50,000 undocumented students enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities.<ref name=\"WastedTalent\">{{Cite journal\n  | last = Gonzales\n  | first = Roberto\n  | title = Wasted Talent and Broken Dreams: The Lost Potential of Undocumented Students\n  | journal = 5 in Focus\n  | issue = 13\n  | date = Oct 2007\n  | url = http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/index.php?content=f071001 }}</ref>  Of these college students, 18,000 were enrolled in California community colleges in the 2005-2006 school year as a result of financial accessibility.<ref name=\"WastedTalent\"/> According to Roberto Gonzalez, Professor of Sociology at the University of Washington, \"Given the opportunity to receive additional education and move into better-paying jobs, undocumented students would pay more in taxes and have more money to spend and invest in the U.S. economy.\"\n\n===Admission & enrollment===\nThere is no federal law that prohibits the admission of undocumented immigrants to U.S. colleges and universities, public or private, nor does federal law require students to prove citizenship in order to enter U.S. institutions of higher education.<ref name=\"AdvisingUndocumentedStudents\">{{Cite web\n  | title = Advising Undocumented Students\n  | publisher = The College Board\n  | url = http://professionals.collegeboard.com/guidance/financial-aid/undocumented-students| date = 2007-09-07\n  }}</ref>  However, every institution has its own policies on admitting undocumented students.

The language in both PRWORA and IIRIRA are vague enough that they allow states to decide how to address tuition rates and state financial aid for their students.

Undocumented students must rely primarily on private scholarships as a source of funding for their postsecondary education.

The opportunities to learn about college access is inequitably taught to undocumented students.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Gildersleeve|first=Ryan Evely|last2=Ranero|first2=Jessica J.|date=2010-09-01|title=Precollege contexts of undocumented students: Implications for student affairs professionals|journal=New Directions for Student Services|language=en|volume=2010|issue=131|pages=19\u201333|doi=10.1002/ss.365|issn=1536-0695}}</ref> Undocumented students face many challenges in their pre-collegiate years that can inhibit their knowledge to access to higher education in the future.  Most undocumented students come from working class or working poor families, which often forces them to live in communities where they become vulnerable to crimes, poor housing conditions, high unemployment, and underperforming schools<ref name=\":6\" /> Many of the schools they attend face high teacher turnover, overcrowding, and inadequate teacher preparation.  Many of the students are placed into language development courses, which often do not provide the rigorous coursework needed for college preparation.<ref name=\":6\" /> These students also may struggle with their schoolwork due to the discontinuity in their education.  Some students arrive in the United States after attending schools in their country of birth.  Adjusting to the education system in the United States can be a challenge for students. Some may be behind because their previous schools were not teaching the same curriculum or if their schools were ahead of the curriculum, students might lose interest in their new schools. Undocumented students can also struggle with their need to contribute money to their household.  Some students work as migrant farmers alongside their parents, this economic need can set them back in their education and in their path to understanding the steps to higher education.<ref name=\":6\" /> All of these things can inhibit undocumented students from successfully preparing for higher education.\n\nAnother barrier undocumented students face in their access to higher education is the lack of resources and adequate support from school professionals.  Many school professionals\u2014teachers, counselors, other personnel\u2014are not always aware of their state's policies regarding admission, tuition and financial aid for undocumented students.  Some school professionals are even unaware which students on their campus are undocumented. School professionals, often, do not receive training about policies that affect students and some have acknowledged that they only learned because of interactions with students or what they have learned through the media.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Lad|first=Kaetlyn|last2=Braganza|first2=Desiree|title=Increasing Knowledge Related to the Experiences of Undocumented Immigrants in Public Schools|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=EJ1013134|journal=Educational Leadership and Administration: Teaching and Program Development|language=en|volume=24|pages=1\u201315|issn=1064-4474|date=2012-12-31}}</ref> Some undocumented students, who have been surveyed regarding their educational experience, claimed to feel as if they \"lucked out\", having someone to mentor them in college access.<ref name=\":7\" /> Unfortunately, not all students feel this way.

Many parents of undocumented students do not have the knowledge to help their child pursue higher education, but these families have strong family networks, and with accurate information, students will then be able to share it with the younger children in their networks.  If community groups and school professionals reach out to undocumented students in ways that work within their culture, these students can have in increased chance of attending higher education.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==Employment and transitions into adulthood==\nYouth brought to the United States as adolescents are at greater risk for adjustment difficulties.

Youth undergo three transition periods as they enter into adulthood; discovery, learning to be undocumented, and coping. The first, discovery (ages 16\u201318) is the time where youth first discover that they are undocumented. Within this period, key transitional markers such as obtaining a driver's license and applying for college are experienced. These markers often become the first time many youth learn that they are undocumented.  The second period, learning to be undocumented (ages 18\u201324) is a series of life alterations in which youth learn to live as an undocumented immigrant. This includes finding work as an undocumented immigrant and postponing secondary education. The third, coping (ages 25\u201329) is adjusting to lower expectations and realizing the true limits of their rights. This leads many youth to follow into the same job pool as their undocumented parents.<ref name=\"Gonzales\" />\n\nThis gap still exists between higher education and financial aid for undocumented students. Since undocumented students are not eligible for most forms of financial aid, merit scholarships are not feasible as they are most often restrict their eligibility to U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Undocumented students are not eligible for federal aid, thus, benefits that come from FAFSA or Pell Grants do not apply to these students.  Most state-based aid is also out of reach for undocumented students so grants, work study and loans are not options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e4fc.org/images/Fact_Sheet.pdf|title=Fact Sheet: An Overview of College-Bound Undocumented Students|publisher=Educators for Fair Consideration|date=1 January 2012|access-date=21 April 2015}}</ref> States opt to pass their own legislation allowing in-state tuition for undocumented students; while this is an important step for undocumented students, it does not fully bridge the gap for financial aid.

However, they also disclosed being very involved in college extracurricular activities to feel a sense of belonging and validation. Munoz's <ref name=\"Munoz, S. M. 2008\"/> qualitative study also indicates that 40% of undocumented students chose to be involved by participating in community service or mentoring activities to assist undocumented youth like themselves.\n\nDue to their unclear legal status, some youth do generate feelings of being an outsider and dissociate from civic engagement.<ref name=\"Perez, W. 2010\"/> Through an online survey of open-ended questions, Perez, Espinoza, Ramos, Coronado, and Cortes <ref name=\"Perez, W. 2010\"/> reported that in elementary school, 38% of undocumented students were civically engaged. In middle school, rates increased to 41%. In high school, 73% participated in civic engagement with 34% reporting spending more than 40 hours per year doing volunteer work. Also, 7% participated in social services, 3% were engaged in activism, 29% tutored other students, and 55% operated administrative work. In general, 86% of all respondents also participated in extracurricular activities during high school. In addition to college, 55% participated in some form of civic engagement. Even though undocumented Latino students had a high percentage in civic engagement, they also reported higher levels of feeling rejection because of their undocumented status. Ultimately, Perez, Espinoza, Ramos, Coronado, and Cortes <ref name=\"Perez, W. 2010\"/> identified feelings of rejection were not correlated with lack of involvement and that most undocumented Latino youth going to college are engaging in U.S. civic life.\n\nUndocumented youth change and acculturate to multiple circumstances that surround them by studying hard, following the codes of conduct, and acting as good citizens of the United States.

Undocumented students keep high aspirations and participate in civil engagement, disregarding the barriers they may face due to their undocumented status in the United States.\n\n==Youth activism==\n[[File:Dreamers AZ Sit-in 5-17-10.jpg|thumb|Students protesting on behalf of the DREAM Act in Senator John McCain's office, May 2010]]\n\nIn recent years,{{when|date=December 2016}} undocumented youth have gathered to lobby for legislative action. Organizations such as the Education Not Deportation (END) Our Pain Organization have been established to demand moratorium for youth eligible for the Development, Relief, Education for Alien Minors ([[DREAM Act]]) Act which would grant conditional legal status to those brought here under the age of 16 if they attend college or join the military.  Throughout 2009 and 2010, a number of sit-ins, hunger strikes, marches, and social media campaigns were conducted by many activist organizations.

Doe}}\n\nIn the United States, children are given the right to an elementary and secondary education (K-12) regardless of their immigration status.\n\nPlyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States struck down a state statute denying funding for education to undocumented immigrant children. The case simultaneously struck down a municipal school district's attempt to charge such immigrants an annual $1,000 tuition fee to compensate for state funding.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Court found that where states limit the rights afforded to people (specifically children) based on their status as immigrants, this limitation must be examined under an intermediate scrutiny standard to determine whether it furthers a substantial goal of the State.\n\nPrior to 1975, all students in Texas were able to attend public elementary and secondary school. The state government provided funding to schools based on the number of students enrolled. In May 1975, the state legislature amended the Texas Education Code to provide that only U.S. citizens or lawfully admitted noncitizens would be counted for financial aid purposes.<ref>Lopez, Lopez 2010, p. 16.</ref>  Schools were given the option to allow or reject undocumented students and to charge tuition if they chose to accept them.

Neither is true, the deferment only provides the qualified recipients to have a lawful presence, meaning the authorities cannot force them to leave the country although they still lack legal immigration status.  DACA statuses can be terminated or not renewed based on the discretion of DHS, as it is not a law.  DACA is a presidential executive authority, which also means that it can change based on future presidents.  DACA, therefore, creates open space for undocumented students to qualify for postsecondary education benefits.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA)===\nIn 1996, Congress approved the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) to improve immigration law in the United States.

The act also gives states the discretionary power to determine the tuition rates publicly funded schools and the authority to provide state financial aid.

A Senate filibuster blocked it on December 18, 2010.<ref name=\"BillSummary\" />  It would provide a mechanism for undocumented students of good moral character to become legal permanent residents. The DREAM Act initially allowed beneficiaries to qualify for federal student aid but was changed in the 2010 version of the bill. In order to be eligible, individuals must have come to the U.S. as children (under the age of 16), graduated from a U.S. high school and be a long-term resident (at least 5 years). An age cap of 35 was also set. The latest version of the DREAM Act does not grant legal immigrant status to anyone for at least two years. Previous versions of the Act would have immediately granted legal immigrant status to eligible individuals. Many other limitations were also included in this latest version, among them the removal of access to healthcare benefits and limits to [[chain migration]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Undocumented students in the United States]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book|title=The DREAMers: How the Undocumented Youth Movement Transformed the Immigrant Rights Debate|last=Nicholls|first=Walter|publisher=Stanford|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swanson|first=Kate|last2=Torres|first2=Rebecca Maria|date=2016-11-30|title=Child Migration and Transnationalized Violence in Central and North America|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/639098|journal=Journal of Latin American Geography|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=23\u201348|doi=10.1353/lag.2016.0029|issn=1548-5811}}</ref>\n\n[[Category:Demographics of the United States]]\n[[Category:Illegal immigration to the United States]]\n[[Category:Youth in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Jarble", "label": "safe", "comment": "editing a link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undocumented_youth_in_the_United_States"}

Norwich City Council election''' took place on 5 May 2011 to elect members of [[Norwich City Council]] in England. One third of seats were up for election.<ref name=\"election results\">{{cite web\n |url= http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/leap/results/2011/279/\n |title= Local Election Results 2011 - Norwich\n |work= Local Elections Archive Project\n |accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> This was on the same day as other [[2011 United Kingdom local elections|local elections]] and the nationwide [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|referendum on the Alternative Vote]].\n\nAll changes in vote share are calculated with reference to the [[2007 Norwich City Council election|2007 election]], the last time these seats were contested.\n\n==Summary==\n[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] gained Bowthorpe and Catton Grove from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], while the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]] seized Thorpe Hamlet from the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].\n\n*[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]  performed best against the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in their target seats, although they fell short in Wensum and Mancroft as the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party's]] support held up well.  The one [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] gain came in Thorpe Hamlets against the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], where their triumph meant all three of the ward's seats were now held by them. \n*Despite their vote increasing on the previous elections in September 2010, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] still lost the only two seats they were defending.  Disappointing for them, their support rose in all but one of the seats they did not hold previously, while their support fell in the seats they were defending, Bowthorpe and Catton Grove.\n*As in the previous election, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] were relegated to Eaton, while their support across the rest of the city fell sharply.\n\nIn the affluent south west of the city, the Conservatives and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] had fought very hard to win [[Eaton, Norfolk|Eaton]] following the decision of sitting [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Councillor, Ros Wright (wife of Norwich South MP Simon Wright), to stand down.  The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] held on with Caroline Ackroyd securing a majority of 129, although there was a 4.9% swing to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate Chris Groves. Turnout was once again the highest in the city at 58.6%.\n\nAfter the election, the new makeup of the City Council was:\n\n* '''[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]  18 (+2)'''\n* [[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]] 15 (+1)\n* [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] 4 (-1)\n* [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] 2 (-2)\n\nTurnout across the city was 40.2%, with the AV Referendum being seen as partly responsible for the marked rise.\n\n==Election result==\n{{Election Summary Begin|title = Norwich City Council Election, 2011<ref name=\"election results\"/>}}\n{{Election Summary

Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May.

Batman is around 30 years old in the film and neither an experienced superhero nor a beginning crime fighter.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Director [[Matt Reeves]] stated: \"I just felt like well, what I'd love to do is to get a version of this Batman character where he's not yet fully formed. Where there's something to do in this context with who that guy would be in this world today, and to ground him in all of these broken ways. Because at the end of the day, this guy is doing all of this to deal with trauma in his past.\"<ref name=\"NerdistReeves\" /> Pattinson had avoided major franchises since his ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' films, wanting to avoid paparazzi and finding those roles dull, but signed on to play Batman because he found the character's lack of superpowers interesting.<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" /> He described his Batman as flawed, unlike traditional comic book characters,<ref name=\"PattinsonIGN\" /> and said his voice was inspired by his ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|Lighthouse]]'' costar [[Willem Dafoe]]'s voice in that film.<ref name=\"PattinsonDafoe\" /> In preparation, Pattinson trained in [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] with instructor and ''[[John Wick]]'' alumnus [[Rigan Machado]].<ref name=\"PattinsonJiuJitsu\" /> [[Christian Bale]], who played Batman in ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005\u20132012), supported Pattinson,<ref name=\"BaleSupport\" /> encouraging him to \"make [the role] his own\" and ignore critics.<ref name=\"BaleAdvice\" /> Pattinson also received advice from ''The Dark Knight Trilogy''{{'s}} director, [[Christopher Nolan]], whom he worked with on ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]]''.<ref name=\"NolanAdvice\" /> \n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]]:<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><br />Kravitz, who previously voiced the character in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> was chosen over a number of actresses, including [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Ella Balinska]], [[Ana de Armas]], and [[Alicia Vikander]].<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" /> Kravitz said that in contrast to Batman, who represents masculinity, Catwoman represents femininity, and \"femininity represents power, and I think it's a different kind of power than masculine power... slightly more complicated, and softer, too.\" Kravitz drew inspiration from [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], who portrayed the character in ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992).<ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" />\n* [[Paul Dano]] as [[Riddler|Edward Nashton / Riddler]]<ref name=\"DanoCast\" />\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]]:<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> The [[Gotham City Police Department]] commissioner and an ally of Batman.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /> Wright is the first actor of color to portray the character.<ref name=\"WrightGordon\" /> \n* [[John Turturro]] as [[Carmine Falcone]]<ref name=\"TurturroCast\" />\n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as Gil Colson:<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> Gotham's district attorney.<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" />\n* [[Jayme Lawson]] as Bella Re\u00e1l:<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> A mayoral candidate in Gotham.<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /><ref name=\"LawsonCast\" />\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]:<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" /> Batman's butler and mentor.<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" />\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as [[Penguin (character)|Oswald \"Oz\" Cobblepot / Penguin]]<ref name=\"IGN: PenguinLook\" /><ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" />\n\nAdditionally, Gil Perez-Abraham, [[Charlie Carver]], and [[Max Carver]] have been cast in undisclosed roles.<ref name=\"AbrahamCast\" /><ref name=\"CarversCast\" />\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n{{multiple images\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = left\n| total_width = 250\n| image1 = Ben Affleck by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| image2 = Matt Reeves (13948765595) (cropped).jpg\n| footer = [[Ben Affleck]] (''left'') was initially set to direct, write, produce, and star in ''The Batman'', but handed the former two duties to [[Matt Reeves]] (''right'') in 2017 before stepping down entirely in 2019.\n}}\nIn August 2013, [[Ben Affleck]] was cast as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]] in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU), with plans to play the role in at least three films.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian\" /> He made his debut in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"AffleckNYTimes\" /> and later appeared in ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016)<ref name=\"AffleckTime\" /> and ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"DCEU2017\" /> In October 2014, [[Warner Bros.]] revealed plans for a standalone Batman film starring Affleck,<ref name=\"2014Slate\" /> and by July 2015, he was in negotiations to direct and co-write the screenplay with [[Geoff Johns]]. According to ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', Affleck and Johns were expected to turn in a draft by October 2015, and that production would begin after Affleck finished work on ''[[Live by Night (film)|Live by Night]]''. The plot was to be set after the events of ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League'';<ref name=\"July2015Deadline\" /><ref name=\"July2015Variety\" /> Affleck stated that the film would feature a \"mostly original\" story that used elements of comic books for inspiration, like what director [[Zack Snyder]] did with ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"AffleckMovieWeb\" /> According to [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], who was attached as cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set in [[Arkham Asylum]] and dealt with [[insanity]].<ref name=\"RichardsonCollider\" />\n\nAffleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with Johns implying that the film would explore the death of [[Robin (character)|Robin]] which was hinted at in ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] in April, Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal but present.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> Reeves said that he was \"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019.<ref name=\"ReevesDeadline\" /> Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month.<ref name=\"ReevesFirstDraft\" /> Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him.<ref name=\"AffleckReplace\" /> This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good.

Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\" The casting was also met with backlash from Batman fans\u2014with some setting up a [[Change.org]] petition to have it reversed\u2014but Pattinson said he found responses \"less vitriolic than I was expecting [...] it's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you.\"<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" />\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] entered negotiations to play [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] in September, and [[Jonah Hill]] entered negotiations to play either the [[Riddler]] or the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]].<ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /><ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> In October, Wright was cast, but Hill exited negotiations.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"JonahHillNo\" /> According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Justin Kroll, Hill wanted to be paid $10 million\u2014more than double the amount that Pattinson would make<ref name=\"PattinsonPay\" />\u2014while Kit wrote that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take.<ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> Additionally, [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] was cast as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]] (reprising her role from 2017's ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'')<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /> following a screen test with Pattinson; [[Ana de Armas]], [[Ella Balinska]], and [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> [[Paul Dano]] was cast as the Riddler shortly afterward.<ref name=\"DanoCast\" /> In November, [[Andy Serkis]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[John Turturro]] were cast as [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the Penguin, and [[Carmine Falcone]], respectively.<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" /><ref name=\"FarrellTalks\" /><ref name=\"TurturroCast\" /> [[Jayme Lawson]] also joined the cast as a politician,<ref name=\"LawsonCast\" /> while [[Peter Sarsgaard]] was cast in December.<ref name=\"SarsgaardCast\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began in January 2020 in [[London]],<ref name=\"SlashFilmJan2020\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantJan2020\" /><ref name=\"SyfyWireJan2020\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Vengeance''.<ref name=\"NMEBatman\" /> Later in the month, Warner Bros. confirmed the main cast;<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> Gil Perez-Abraham was revealed to have a role in February, as were [[Charlie Carver|Charlie]] and [[Max Carver]] in March.<ref name=\"AbrahamCast\" /><ref name=\"CarversCast\" /> [[Greig Fraser]] is serving as cinematographer, reuniting with Reeves after they worked together on ''[[Let Me In (film)|Let Me In]]'' (2010).<ref name=\"FraserDP\" /> Scenes at a cemetery were filmed at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]] in mid-February.<ref name=\"SyfyWireFeb2020\" /> In March, Warner Bros. decided to move production to [[Liverpool]]<ref name=\"Liverpool2020\" /> due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> Unlike other studios with films in production, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting on ''The Batman'',<ref name=\"NoProductionHalt\" /><ref name=\"CoronavirusHandling\" /> but eventually did so for two weeks on March 14.<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" />\n\nOn March 25, Reeves announced that filming had been suspended indefinitely, \"till it is safe for us all to resume.\"<ref name=\"DelayedIndefinitely\" /> ''Variety'' reported that production was unlikely to restart until around mid-May, and that the release date was expected to be delayed as a result.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/> In April, Reeves stated that around a quarter of the film had been shot prior to suspension and that he had been taking time \"pouring through dailies, looking at takes, and what's to come.\" Reeves said that he was not planning to perform script rewrites in the meantime, but was using the opportunity to explore the film's tone.<ref name=\"DeadlineDailies\" />\n\n== Music ==\nIn October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator [[Michael Giacchino]] would be composing the film's score.<ref name=\"GiacchinoTHR\" /> Later that month, Giacchino confirmed that he had already finished writing the main theme because he was so excited to do so.<ref name=\"Giacchino/Film\" /> In film production, the music is not written until later, but since Giacchino wrote the music early on, he and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on June 25, 2021,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> although ''Variety'' reported there is a strong possibility it will be delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/>\n\n== Future ==\n''The Batman'' is intended to be the first of a Batman film trilogy.<ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> In November 2019, Kroll and Brent Lang of

Produced by [[DC Films]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it was developed as <!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.-->the tenth film in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) and<!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.--> a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film franchise]]. The film is directed by [[Matt Reeves]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Mattson Tomlin]]. It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[John Turturro]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Jayme Lawson]], [[Andy Serkis]], and [[Colin Farrell]] rounding out the [[ensemble cast]].\n\nAfter he was cast as Batman in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), [[Ben Affleck]] began developing a DCEU Batman film with [[Geoff Johns]], and was attached to direct, write, produce, and star. In January 2017, Affleck stepped down from directing and writing after struggling with the story and so he could focus on playing Batman. Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May. [[Principal photography]] began in [[London, England]] in January 2020, although production has been indefinitely suspended due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><br />A billionaire socialite and heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]] who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld as a masked vigilante. Batman is around 30 years old in the film and neither an experienced superhero nor a beginning crime fighter.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Director [[Matt Reeves]] stated: \"I just felt like well, what I'd love to do is to get a version of this Batman character where he's not yet fully formed. Where there's something to do in this context with who that guy would be in this world today, and to ground him in all of these broken ways. Because at the end of the day, this guy is doing all of this to deal with trauma in his past.\"<ref name=\"NerdistReeves\" /> Pattinson had avoided major franchises since his ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' films, wanting to avoid paparazzi and finding those roles dull, but signed on to play Batman because he found the character's lack of superpowers interesting.<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" /> He described his Batman as flawed, unlike traditional comic book characters,<ref name=\"PattinsonIGN\" /> and said his voice was inspired by his ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|Lighthouse]]'' costar [[Willem Dafoe]]'s voice in that film.<ref name=\"PattinsonDafoe\" /> In preparation, Pattinson trained in [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] with instructor and ''[[John Wick]]'' alumnus [[Rigan Machado]].<ref name=\"PattinsonJiuJitsu\" /> [[Christian Bale]], who played Batman in ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005\u20132012), supported Pattinson,<ref name=\"BaleSupport\" /> encouraging him to \"make [the role] his own\" and ignore critics.<ref name=\"BaleAdvice\" /> Pattinson also received advice from ''The Dark Knight Trilogy''{{'s}} director, [[Christopher Nolan]], whom he worked with on ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]]''.<ref name=\"NolanAdvice\" /> [[Ben Affleck]] portrayed the character in previous [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) films<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian\" /> and was set to reprise his role before stepping down in January 2019.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" />\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]]:<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><br />Kravitz, who previously voiced the character in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> was chosen over a number of actresses, including [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Ella Balinska]], [[Ana de Armas]], and [[Alicia Vikander]].<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" /> Kravitz said that in contrast to Batman, who represents masculinity, Catwoman represents femininity, and \"femininity represents power, and I think it's a different kind of power than masculine power... slightly more complicated, and softer, too.\" Kravitz drew inspiration from [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], who portrayed the character in ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992).<ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" />\n* [[Paul Dano]] as [[Riddler|Edward Nashton / Riddler]]<ref name=\"DanoCast\" />\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]]:<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> The [[Gotham City Police Department]] commissioner and an ally of Batman.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /> Wright is the first actor of color to portray the character,<ref name=\"WrightGordon\" /> who was previously portrayed by [[J.

According to ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', Affleck and Johns were expected to turn in a draft by October 2015, and that production would begin after Affleck finished work on ''[[Live by Night (film)|Live by Night]]''. The plot was to be set after the events of ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League'';<ref name=\"July2015Deadline\" /><ref name=\"July2015Variety\" /> Affleck stated that the film would feature a \"mostly original\" story that used elements of comic books for inspiration, like what director [[Zack Snyder]] did with ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"AffleckMovieWeb\" /> According to [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], who was attached as cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set in [[Arkham Asylum]] and dealt with [[insanity]].<ref name=\"RichardsonCollider\" />\n\nAffleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with Johns implying that the film would explore the death of [[Robin (character)|Robin]] which was hinted at in ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] in April, Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal but present.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> Reeves said that he was \"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019.<ref name=\"ReevesDeadline\" /> Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month.<ref name=\"ReevesFirstDraft\" /> Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him.<ref name=\"AffleckReplace\" /> This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good. I also think you'll drink yourself to death if you go through what you just went through again.\"<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[File:Robert Pattinson Premiere of The Lost City of Z at Zoo Palast Berlinale 2017 02.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Pattinson]] (pictured in 2017) was cast to replace Affleck in May 2019]]\nBy May 2019, [[Robert Pattinson]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Armie Hammer]], and [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] were on the shortlist to replace Affleck as Batman, Pattinson being the frontrunner.<ref name=\"PattinsonFrontrunner\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonEyed\" /><ref name=\"BatmanShortlist\" /> Reeves began to consider Pattinson early in development, but was unsure if he would want to take the part and did not contact him.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Pattinson's avoidance of \"big studio franchise films\" meant he had not appeared in any of rival [[Marvel Studios]]' projects, something that made him desirable to Warner Bros. Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\" The casting was also met with backlash from Batman fans\u2014with some setting up a [[Change.org]] petition to have it reversed\u2014but Pattinson said he found responses \"less vitriolic than I was expecting [...] it's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you.\"<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" />\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] entered negotiations to play [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] in September, and [[Jonah Hill]] entered negotiations to play either the [[Riddler]] or the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]].<ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /><ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> In October, Wright was cast, but Hill exited negotiations.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"JonahHillNo\" /> According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Justin Kroll, Hill wanted to be paid $10 million\u2014more than double the amount that Pattinson would make<ref name=\"PattinsonPay\" />\u2014while Kit wrote that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take.<ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> Additionally, [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] was cast as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]] (reprising her role from 2017's ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'')<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /> following a screen test with Pattinson; [[Ana de Armas]], [[Ella Balinska]], and [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> [[Paul Dano]] was cast as the Riddler shortly afterward.<ref name=\"DanoCast\" /> In November, [[Andy Serkis]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[John Turturro]] were cast as [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the Penguin, and [[Carmine Falcone]], respectively.<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" /><ref name=\"FarrellTalks\" /><ref name=\"TurturroCast\" /> [[Jayme Lawson]] also joined the cast as a politician,<ref name=\"LawsonCast\" /> while [[Peter Sarsgaard]] was cast in December.<ref name=\"SarsgaardCast\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began in January 2020 in [[London]],<ref name=\"SlashFilmJan2020\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantJan2020\" /><ref name=\"SyfyWireJan2020\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Vengeance''.<ref name=\"NMEBatman\" /> Later in the month, Warner Bros. confirmed the main cast;<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> Gil Perez-Abraham was revealed to have a role in February, as were [[Charlie Carver|Charlie]] and [[Max Carver]] in March.<ref name=\"AbrahamCast\" /><ref name=\"CarversCast\" /> [[Greig Fraser]] is serving as cinematographer, reuniting with Reeves after they worked together on ''[[Let Me In (film)|Let Me In]]'' (2010).<ref name=\"FraserDP\" /> Scenes at a cemetery were filmed at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]] in mid-February.<ref name=\"SyfyWireFeb2020\" /> In March, Warner Bros. decided to move production to [[Liverpool]]<ref name=\"Liverpool2020\" /> due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> Unlike other studios with films in production, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting on ''The Batman'',<ref name=\"NoProductionHalt\" /><ref name=\"CoronavirusHandling\" /> but eventually did so for two weeks on March 14.<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" />\n\nOn March 25, Reeves announced that filming had been suspended indefinitely, \"till it is safe for us all to resume.\"<ref name=\"DelayedIndefinitely\" /> ''Variety'' reported that production was unlikely to restart until around mid-May, and that the release date was expected to be delayed as a result.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/> In April, Reeves stated that around a quarter of the film had been shot prior to suspension and that he had been taking time \"pouring through dailies, looking at takes, and what's to come.\" Reeves said that he was not planning to perform script rewrites in the meantime, but was using the opportunity to explore the film's tone.<ref name=\"DeadlineDailies\" />\n\n== Music ==\nIn October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator [[Michael Giacchino]] would be composing the film's score.<ref name=\"GiacchinoTHR\" /> Later that month, Giacchino confirmed that he had already finished writing the main theme because he was so excited to do so.<ref name=\"Giacchino/Film\" /> In film production, the music is not written until later, but since Giacchino wrote the music early on, he and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on June 25, 2021,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> although ''Variety'' reported there is a strong possibility it will be delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/>\n\n== Future ==\n''The Batman'' is intended to be the first of a Batman film trilogy.<ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> In November 2019, Kroll and Brent Lang of ''Variety'' reported that key cast members are signed on to reprise their roles in future DC films.<ref name=\"DCFilmsFutureNov2019\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- CAST -->\n\n<ref
