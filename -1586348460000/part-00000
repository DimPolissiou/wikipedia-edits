Wales played its first fixture in March 1876, four years after [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]] had contested the first-ever international match. The team played annual fixtures against Scotland, England, and later [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] and these fixtures were eventually organised into the [[British Home Championship]], an annual competition between the [[Home Nations]]. Wales did not win its first championship until the [[1906\u201307 British Home Championship|1906\u201307 edition]] of the competition and the triumph remained the nation's only title before the First World War. Wales improved considerably in the post-war period, and claimed three titles during the 1920s, although the team was often hindered by the reluctance of [[English Football League|Football League]] clubs to release its players for international duty. The situation was so grave that, in the early 1930s, Wales was forced to select a team of lower league and amateur players in a side that became known as \"Keenor and the 10 unknowns\", in reference to captain [[Fred Keenor]] and the relative obscurity of his teammates.\n\nWhen able to call upon its strongest side, Wales enjoyed its most successful period in the British Home Championship, winning four titles in the six years before the Second World War. As competitive football resumed after the war, Wales began facing opponents from further afield and played matches against numerous other European nations for the first time. The side also began competing in qualification groups for the [[FIFA World Cup]], but failed to qualify for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] editions. Under manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]], Wales qualified for its first World Cup in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] and progressed from its group before being defeated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-final.\n\nThe side suffered a decline in the 1960s as the 1958 World Cup generation gradually retired. [[Dave Bowen]] replaced Murphy and managed the team for a decade between 1964 and 1974 but enjoyed little success, failing to qualify for a World Cup or the early editions of the [[UEFA European Championship|European Nations' Cup]] (later known as the European Championships). He did help the side to share the British Home Championship during the [[1969\u201370 British Home Championship|1969\u201370 season]], the last time Wales won the tournament before it was discontinued. In total, Wales won the championship 12 times, sharing five titles. \n\nBowen left the role in 1974, having turned down the chance to take the position full-time. He was replaced by Englishman [[Mike Smith (football manager)|Mike Smith]] who led the side to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1976]] in its centenary year, before being defeated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].{{#tag:ref|For the 1976 tournament, quarter-finals were played as a two-legged, home and away tie with the finals hosting only the semi-finals and beyond.<ref name=\"1976rsssf\"/>|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==Formation and early matches==\n[[File:Wales V Scotland 3386999.tif|thumb|A newspaper report of Wales first competitive match against Scotland in 1876]]\nThe [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first]] official international [[association football]] match was held in November 1872 between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0012/ |title=The first international football match |publisher=BBC |last=Mitchell |first=Paul |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Four years later, G.

One of the debutants in the team was [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea Town's]] [[Willie Davies (footballer)|Willie Davies]] who made an instant impact, scoring one of his side's goals during a 2\u20130 victory over Scotland in the opening game. Davies scored again in Wales' second match, a 2\u20131 victory over England with [[Ted Vizard]] scoring the winning goal.

When Wales was left short for the visit of Scotland in the [[1925\u201326 British Home Championship|1925\u201326 Championship]], Ted Robbins called up debutant [[Jack Lewis (footballer, born 1902)|Jack Lewis]] after following him to a train station in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] where he was due to travel to Birmingham to play for Cardiff City.<ref name=\"s105106\">{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=105\u2013106}}</ref> Defeats to Scotland and Ireland followed and Robbins was again forced to make a last minute interception for the final match against England.

The ruling was designed to force international matches to be scheduled on days that would not clash with Football League fixtures. Wales' first match under the ruling was the opening game of the [[1930\u201331 British Home Championship]] against Scotland, which was largely unaffected as it drew the majority of its players from its own leagues. Wales were forced to call up a mixture of lower division and amateur players in order to field a side. Nine of Wales' eleven players made their international debut in the game, with only captain Fred Keenor and goalkeeper [[Len Evans (footballer)|Len Evans]] having previous international experience.

Wales played its first fixture in March 1876, four years after [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]] had contested the first-ever international match. The team played annual fixtures against Scotland, England, and later [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] and these fixtures were eventually organised into the [[British Home Championship]], an annual competition between the [[Home Nations]]. Wales did not win its first championship until the [[1906\u201307 British Home Championship|1906\u201307 edition]] of the competition and the triumph remained the nation's only title before the First World War. Wales improved considerably in the post-war period, and claimed three titles during the 1920s, although the team was often hindered by the reluctance of [[English Football League|Football League]] clubs to release its players for international duty. The situation was so grave that, in the early 1930s, Wales was forced to select a team of lower league and amateur players in a side that became known as \"Keenor and the 10 unknowns\", in reference to captain [[Fred Keenor]] and the relative obscurity of his teammates.\n\nWhen able to call upon its strongest side, Wales enjoyed its most successful period in the British Home Championship, winning four titles in the six years before the Second World War. As competitive football resumed after the war, Wales began facing opponents from further afield and played matches against numerous other European nations for the first time. The side also began competing in qualification groups for the [[FIFA World Cup]], but failed to qualify for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] editions. Under manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]], Wales qualified for its first World Cup in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] and progressed from its group before being defeated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-final.\n\nThe side suffered a decline in the 1960s as the 1958 World Cup generation gradually retired. [[Dave Bowen]] replaced Murphy and managed the team for a decade between 1964 and 1974 but enjoyed little success, failing to qualify for a World Cup or the early editions of the [[UEFA European Championship|European Nations' Cup]] (later known as the European Championships). He did help the side to share the British Home Championship during the [[1969\u201370 British Home Championship|1969\u201370 season]], the last time Wales won the tournament before it was discontinued. In total, Wales won the championship 12 times, sharing five titles. \n\nBowen left the role in 1974, having turned down the chance to take the position full-time. He was replaced by Englishman [[Mike Smith (football manager)|Mike Smith]] who led the side to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1976]] in its centenary year, before being defeated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].{{#tag:ref|For the 1976 tournament, quarter-finals were played as a two-legged, home and away tie with the finals hosting only the semi-finals and beyond.<ref name=\"1976rsssf\"/>|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==Formation and early matches==\n[[File:Wales V Scotland 3386999.tif|thumb|A newspaper report of Wales first competitive match against Scotland in 1876]]\nThe [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first]] official international [[association football]] match was held in November 1872 between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0012/ |title=The first international football match |publisher=BBC |last=Mitchell |first=Paul |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Four years later, G.

In March 1910, Wales suffered a 1\u20130 defeat to Scotland when Roose allowed a speculative shot into the net having had his back turned towards play, talking to a spectator. In November of the same year, Roose suffered a broken arm while playing for his club side but declared himself fit for the British Home Championship internationals in March 1911. A poor performance in a 2\u20132 draw with Scotland ultimately ended his international career as he was never selected for Wales again.<ref name=\"stead7679\"/>\n\nWales came within one match of winning a second title in 1912 and 1913, losing deciding matches against England on both occasions.<ref name=\"bhc1900\"/> In the [[1913\u201314 British Home Championship|final edition of the championship]] before the First World War, Wales finished bottom of the table with one point.

A goalless draw with England and a 2\u20131 victory over Ireland did secure the side the runners-up spot.<ref name=\"bhc1920\"/> With club sides in Wales attracting record crowds, the national team often found itself losing out to the domestic game. The victory over Ireland was held on the same day that [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] hosted [[South Shields F.C.|South Shields]] in the [[Football League Second Division]], with only 11,000 attending the national side's match in Swansea while more than 30,000 attended Cardiff's fixture.<ref>{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=94\u201395}}</ref> Disappointing results between 1922 and 1923 prompted a revamp of the team for the [[1923\u201324 British Home Championship]]. One of the debutants in the team was [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea Town's]] [[Willie Davies (footballer)|Willie Davies]] who made an instant impact, scoring one of his side's goals during a 2\u20130 victory over Scotland in the opening game. Davies scored again in Wales' second match, a 2\u20131 victory over England with [[Ted Vizard]] scoring the winning goal. A final victory over Ireland, via a [[Moses Russell]] penalty, secured the title for Wales having beaten all three sides in the same tournament for the first time.<ref>{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=98\u201399}}</ref> The success was partly attributed to the team's star players being released to play, but this trend soon reverted to type for the opening match of the [[1924\u201325 British Home Championship|1924\u201325 tournament]]; six players withdrew from the squad for the opening match, a 3\u20131 defeat to Scotland. Wales' success did prompt England to agree to a Saturday fixture in Wales for the first time; [[Fred Keenor]] scored for Wales but the side fell to a 2\u20131 defeat.<ref>{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=100\u2013101}}</ref> Only a goalless draw with Ireland stopped Wales finishing last, only a year after winning the tournament.<ref name=\"bhc1920\"/>\n\nSquad withdrawals proved a continued problem for the Welsh side. When Wales was left short for the visit of Scotland in the [[1925\u201326 British Home Championship|1925\u201326 Championship]], Ted Robbins called up debutant [[Jack Lewis (footballer, born 1902)|Jack Lewis]] after following him to a train station in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] where he was due to travel to Birmingham to play for Cardiff City.<ref name=\"s105106\">{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=105\u2013106}}</ref> Defeats to Scotland and Ireland followed and Robbins was again forced to make a last minute interception for the final match against England.

The competition had started poorly for the side, conceding two goals in the first half against Scotland before [[Ernie Curtis]] and an own goal by [[Jimmy Gibson (footballer, born 1901)|Jimmy Gibson]] salvaged a point. Wales defeated England 2\u20131 before travelling to Belfast to play Ireland in the final match. The game was tied at 1\u20131 until [[Wilf Lewis]] secured the win for Wales, scoring the winning goal by charging both the ball and opposition goalkeeper into the net.

The national side's poor results at the end of the 1920s were partly blamed on the deterioration of Welsh club sides. By the end of the decade, Cardiff City had been relegated to the Second Division, [[Aberdare Athletic F.C.|Aberdare Athletic]] had dropped out of the Football League and both [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] and [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] had survived re-elections to avoid the same fate.<ref name=\"s113114\"/>\n\n==Pre-war recovery==\n[[File:Fred Keenor, Brentford FC footballer, 1919.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Fred Keenor]], who captained the team of \"unknowns\" in 1930]]\nIn 1930, the Football League introduced a new ruling which prohibited its members from releasing players for international fixtures. The ruling was designed to force international matches to be scheduled on days that would not clash with Football League fixtures. Wales' first match under the ruling was the opening game of the [[1930\u201331 British Home Championship]] against Scotland, which was largely unaffected as it drew the majority of its players from its own leagues. Wales were forced to call up a mixture of lower division and amateur players in order to field a side. Nine of Wales' eleven players made their international debut in the game, with only captain Fred Keenor and goalkeeper [[Len Evans (footballer)|Len Evans]] having previous international experience.

The refusal of clubs to release players for international duty or to not allow a player to travel until a day before the match often disrupted the team. In his book ''Red Dragons: The Story of Welsh Football'', Phil Stead writes that Dave Bowen often could \"not pick a side until the day of the game because he was never sure who would be available.\"<ref name=\"s195197\">{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=195\u2013197}}</ref> The final match of the 1970 World Cup qualification group against Italy was nearly forfeited as Wales struggled to name a squad.

Goalkeeper [[Gary Sprake]] later remarked that \"the international set-up with Wales at this time was amateurish at best\". Sprake later admitted to feigning injury under the guidance of his club manager [[Don Revie]] in order to avoid selection with the national side.<ref name=\"s186187\"/> [[John Toshack]], who made his debut in 1969, made similar comments: \"The whole set-up was a bit of a shambles [...] some of the players with more fashionable clubs were not too concerned about turning up for the less glamorous games.\"<ref name=\"s186187\"/> An incident in 1969 drew considerable criticism of the FAW when it failed to book enough seats for the ten travelling Welsh players and the organisation's members. When none of the officials offered to give up their seat, the crew declared that the last person to board the craft, winger [[Gil Reece]], would have to disembark.

They continue to play each other annually in all other sports offered by the two universities.\n\nRutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its excellent football and women's basketball programs, owning a 6-4 all-time [[bowl game|bowl]] record and appearing in a [[2007 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|National Final]] in 2007, respectively. In 2008 and 2009, Rutgers expanded their football home [[HighPoint.com Stadium]] on the [[Busch Campus of Rutgers University|Busch Campus]], and the basketball teams play at [[Louis Brown Athletic Center]] on [[Livingston Campus (Rutgers University)|Livingston Campus]]. Both venues and campuses are located in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway]], immediately across the [[Raritan River]] from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]].

The [[Rutgers\u2013Camden]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Camden Scarlet Raptors|Scarlet Raptors]]. The [[Rutgers\u2013Newark]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Newark Scarlet Raiders|Scarlet Raiders]]. The Scarlet Raiders and the Scarlet Raptors both compete within NCAA [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]].\n\nSeton Hall, unlike Rutgers and Princeton, does not field a football team. Its men's basketball team, however, is one of the Big East's storied programs, New Jersey's most successful representative in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] by number of wins, the state's only men's basketball program to reach a modern [[1989 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|National Final]], and plays its home games at [[Prudential Center]] in downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] approximately four miles from the university's [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] campus.

Shyamalan would produce, but not direct, one film a year for three years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117989271.html?categoryid=1237&cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Night falls for Media Rights | first=Michael | last=Fleming | date=July 21, 2008}}</ref> The first of the three films was ''[[Devil (2010 film)|Devil]]'', a supernatural thriller directed by siblings [[John Erick Dowdle|John]] and Drew Dowdle.

''Devil'' was not a blockbuster hit, but has become a commercial success relative to its budget. The next film in the Night Chronicles series will be called ''Reincarnate''. It will be scripted by Chris Sparling and directed by [[Daniel Stamm]].\n\nIn 2013, Shyamalan directed the film ''[[After Earth]]'', based on a script by [[Gary Whitta]] and starring [[Will Smith]] and [[Jaden Smith]].

Neither the childhood accident nor a supposed rift with the filmmakers ever occurred. The hoax included a nonexistent Sci-Fi publicist, \"David Westover\", whose name appeared on [[press releases]] regarding the special.

It received extremely negative reviews in the United States and won five [[Razzie Award]]s, but it made nearly $320 million internationally at the box office.\n\nIn July 2008, it was announced that Shyamalan had partnered with [[Media Rights Capital]] to form a production company called Night Chronicles. Shyamalan would produce, but not direct, one film a year for three years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117989271.html?categoryid=1237&cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Night falls for Media Rights | first=Michael | last=Fleming | date=July 21, 2008}}</ref> The first of the three films was ''[[Devil (2010 film)|Devil]]'', a supernatural thriller directed by siblings [[John Erick Dowdle|John]] and Drew Dowdle.

''Devil'' was not a blockbuster hit, but has become a commercial success relative to its budget. The next film in the Night Chronicles series will be called ''Reincarnate''. It will be scripted by Chris Sparling and directed by [[Daniel Stamm]].\n\nIn 2013, Shyamalan directed the film ''[[After Earth]]'', based on a script by [[Gary Whitta]] and starring [[Will Smith]] and [[Jaden Smith]]. It was received poorly by critics, with [[Rotten Tomatoes]] giving the film a score of 11% based on 180 reviews.\n\nShyamalan announced in January 2014 that he would be working again with [[Bruce Willis]] on a film titled ''Labor of Love''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/night-shyamalan-bruce-willis-reteam-labor-love/|title=M.

Neither the childhood accident nor a supposed rift with the filmmakers ever occurred. The hoax included a nonexistent Sci-Fi publicist, \"David Westover\", whose name appeared on [[press releases]] regarding the special.

The show marked as the first preschool animated series from Warner Bros. Animation. Although it was initially broadcast in the 4:3 aspect ratio, Baby Looney Tunes is the first Warner Bros. animated series to be produced in the widescreen aspect ratio (16:9). All episodes are currently available on the subscription streaming service [[Boomerang (TV network)]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Baby Looney Tunes episodes}}\n{{:List of Baby Looney Tunes episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*[[Bugs Bunny|Baby Bugs]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Sam Vincent (voice actor)|Sam Vincent]]) He is indicated to be the oldest of the babies, which makes him their official [[leader]]. His leadership however does tend to cause tension, especially with Lola and Daffy. Bugs sometimes gets teased for loving Lola and gets really annoyed by Daffy's name calling.\n*[[Tweety|Baby Tweety]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by Sam Vincent) A yellow [[Domestic canary|canary]]. The youngest and the smallest of the gang. Depicted as the brainstormer, because he comes up with ideas when the others are fresh out of them. He is very sensitive about his small frame (which he must overcome in most episodes centered around him) and curious about what he encounters.\n*[[Daffy Duck|Baby Daffy]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by Sam Vincent) He is second in the lead after Bugs. Often, he always wants his personal gain. When he does not get what he wants he believes he is treated unfairly, not noticing the inconvenience inflicted on the others. But half the time he does have good intentions. He is known to have a fear of robots. Daffy is jealous of Bugs. He seems to say \"Wahoo\" a lot very similar to his earliar shorts. Quite frequently he has made fun of Bugs by making fun of he's name and other things.\n*[[Lola Bunny|Baby Lola]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Tress Macneille]]) Sometimes, she takes charge. Her independence is greater than the others and she has more [[Tomboy|boyish]] tendencies than the other girls.\n*[[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Baby Taz]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]]) As much as Taz is well behaved, he often mistakes various objects for food and sometimes breaks things with his spin. He has a sense of fun which exceeds all the others. He is also more cheeky, crying when things go wrong or when Daffy steals from him.\n*[[Sylvester the Cat|Baby Sylvester]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Terry Klassen]]) A cute [[Tuxedo cat]]. The tallest of the babies, not counting Bugs and Lola's ears. At times, he is [[Shyness|shy]] and anxious, and he makes an easy target for Daffy to hoax and trade with. He is rarely seen using his claws. He likes to get attention from Granny more than the others. Sylvester is afraid of lightning and he hates pickles.\n*[[Melissa Duck|Baby Melissa]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Janyse Jaud]]) She often sticks with Petunia; the two were abruptly added to the main cast in the middle of the first season. She is a highly practical and creative sort with a friendly personality, but at times she can be a control freak and get on the others' nerves.\n*[[Petunia Pig|Baby Petunia]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Chiara Zanni]]) She often sticks with Melissa; the two were abruptly added to the main cast in the middle of the first season. She is more intelligent than the other babies with insatiable curiosity. In the episode \"Let Harder They Fall\", she is no longer wearing diaper anymore like other babies but by the time Petunia wears yellow, frilly training underpants with a white bow in the middle and \"Petunia the Piggy Bank\", she learned to save money. \n*[[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[June Foray]]) She offers professional love and care for the babies to keep them happy. Being the only adult in their lives, the babies are fascinated and inspired by her intelligence, wisdom and ability to overcome problems when they arise with ease. Granny is strict, practical, and old fashioned. \n*Floyd Minton \u2013 (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) Granny's nephew. Sometimes he is overwhelmed by the responsibility he takes on the babies, but he is determined never to let Granny down. He often keeps an eye on one of the individual babies in each episode during Season 2.\n\n===Others===\nSeveral other Looney Tunes characters have made cameos over the course of the show's run, mainly as guest spots or during songs. [[Miss Prissy|Baby Prissy]], [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot|Baby Marc Antony]] and [[Penelope Pussycat|Baby Penelope]] appear in the songs, \u201cDown By The Cage\u201d, \u201cPaws and Feathers\u201d and \u201cVive Le Pew\", respectively. [[Marvin the Martian|Baby Marvin]], [[Elmer Fudd|Baby Elmer]], [[Hare-Way To The Stars|Baby Instant Martians]], [[Gossamer (Looney Tunes)|Baby Gossamer]] and [[Foghorn Leghorn|Baby Foghorn]] appear in \u201cWar Of The Weirds\u201d, \u201cBully For Bugs\u201d, \u201cA Mid-Autumn Night\u2019s Scream\u201d, \u201cStop and Smell Up the Flowers\u201c and \"Cock A Doodle Do It!\", respectively. [[Wile E. Coyote|Baby Wile E. and Baby Road Runner]] appear in multiple songs, as do [[Pepe Le Pew|Baby Pepe]], [[Porky Pig|Baby Porky]] and [[Yosemite Sam|Baby Sam]].\n\n==Production==\nIn 1997, Warner Bros. Animation announced a new show. It was originally under the name ''Lil' Looney Critters'', but in April 1999, they changed the name to ''Baby Looney Tunes''. In January 2001, they ended production and the pilot aired on June 3, 2001. They restarted production 5 days later and re-ended production; and the show started as a full series on July 28, 2001.\n\n==Music==\nUnderscoring for the series was written by veteran animation composers [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0077148/?ref_=nv_sr_2 Steven] and [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0077081/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Julie Bernstein]. They were nominated for a Daytime Emmy (Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition) in 2006. They also composed the score for the Easter movie, ''[[Baby Looney Tunes' Eggs-traordinary Adventure]]'', writing the music and lyrics for the featured songs.\n\n==Home media==\n[[Warner Home Video]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warnerbros.com/studio/divisions/home-entertainment/warner-home-video.html|title=Warner Home Video|author=|date=|website=www.warnerbros.com}}</ref> has released 15 of the 53 episodes of ''Baby Looney Tunes'', including the DVD of the only ''Baby Looney Tunes'' movie: ''Eggs-traordinary Adventure''.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!DVD Name\n!Ep #\n!Release Date\n!Special Features\n|-\n|''Eggs-traordinary Adventure''\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|May 25, 2004\n|\n*2 bonus episodes\n*2 music videos\n*Granny's Activity Day Challenge\n|-\n|''4 Kid Favorites: Baby Looney Tunes''\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|January 17, 2012\n|\n*Menu Challenge: Baby Trivia\n*Menu Challenge: What's That Sound?\n|}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 4 volumes were released on DVD from July 15, 2013.

Quite frequently he has made fun of Bugs by making fun of he's name and other things.\n*[[Lola Bunny|Baby Lola]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Britt McKillip]]) Sometimes, she takes charge. Her independence is greater than the others and she has more [[Tomboy|boyish]] tendencies than the other girls.\n*[[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Baby Taz]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]]) As much as Taz is well behaved, he often mistakes various objects for food and sometimes breaks things with his spin. He has a sense of fun which exceeds all the others. He is also more cheeky, crying when things go wrong or when Daffy steals from him.\n*[[Sylvester the Cat|Baby Sylvester]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Terry Klassen]]) A cute [[Tuxedo cat]]. The tallest of the babies, not counting Bugs and Lola's ears. At times, he is [[Shyness|shy]] and anxious, and he makes an easy target for Daffy to hoax and trade with. He is rarely seen using his claws. He likes to get attention from Granny more than the others. Sylvester is afraid of lightning and he hates pickles.\n*[[Melissa Duck|Baby Melissa]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Janyse Jaud]]) She often sticks with Petunia; the two were abruptly added to the main cast in the middle of the first season. She is a highly practical and creative sort with a friendly personality, but at times she can be a control freak and get on the others' nerves.\n*[[Petunia Pig|Baby Petunia]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[Chiara Zanni]]) She often sticks with Melissa; the two were abruptly added to the main cast in the middle of the first season. She is more intelligent than the other babies with insatiable curiosity. In the episode \"Let Harder They Fall\", she is no longer wearing diaper anymore like other babies but by the time Petunia wears yellow, frilly training underpants with a white bow in the middle and \"Petunia the Piggy Bank\", she learned to save money. \n*[[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]]&nbsp;\u2013 (voiced by [[June Foray]]) She offers professional love and care for the babies to keep them happy. Being the only adult in their lives, the babies are fascinated and inspired by her intelligence, wisdom and ability to overcome problems when they arise with ease. Granny is strict, practical, and old fashioned. \n*Floyd Minton \u2013 (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) Granny's nephew. Sometimes he is overwhelmed by the responsibility he takes on the babies, but he is determined never to let Granny down. He often keeps an eye on one of the individual babies in each episode during Season 2.\n\n===Others===\nSeveral other Looney Tunes characters have made cameos over the course of the show's run, mainly as guest spots or during songs. [[Miss Prissy|Baby Prissy]], [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot|Baby Marc Antony]] and [[Penelope Pussycat|Baby Penelope]] appear in the songs, \u201cDown By The Cage\u201d, \u201cPaws and Feathers\u201d and \u201cVive Le Pew\", respectively. [[Marvin the Martian|Baby Marvin]], [[Elmer Fudd|Baby Elmer]], [[Hare-Way To The Stars|Baby Instant Martians]], [[Gossamer (Looney Tunes)|Baby Gossamer]] and [[Foghorn Leghorn|Baby Foghorn]] appear in \u201cWar Of The Weirds\u201d, \u201cBully For Bugs\u201d, \u201cA Mid-Autumn Night\u2019s Scream\u201d, \u201cStop and Smell Up the Flowers\u201c and \"Cock A Doodle Do It!\", respectively. [[Wile E. Coyote|Baby Wile E. and Baby Road Runner]] appear in multiple songs, as do [[Pepe Le Pew|Baby Pepe]], [[Porky Pig|Baby Porky]] and [[Yosemite Sam|Baby Sam]].\n\n==Production==\nIn 1997, Warner Bros. Animation announced a new show. It was originally under the name ''Lil' Looney Critters'', but in April 1999, they changed the name to ''Baby Looney Tunes''. In January 2001, they ended production and the pilot aired on June 3, 2001. They restarted production 5 days later and re-ended production; and the show started as a full series on July 28, 2001.\n\n==Music==\nUnderscoring for the series was written by veteran animation composers [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0077148/?ref_=nv_sr_2 Steven] and [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0077081/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Julie Bernstein]. They were nominated for a Daytime Emmy (Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition) in 2006. They also composed the score for the Easter movie, ''[[Baby Looney Tunes' Eggs-traordinary Adventure]]'', writing the music and lyrics for the featured songs.\n\n==Home media==\n[[Warner Home Video]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warnerbros.com/studio/divisions/home-entertainment/warner-home-video.html|title=Warner Home Video|author=|date=|website=www.warnerbros.com}}</ref> has released 15 of the 53 episodes of ''Baby Looney Tunes'', including the DVD of the only ''Baby Looney Tunes'' movie: ''Eggs-traordinary Adventure''.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!DVD Name\n!Ep #\n!Release Date\n!Special Features\n|-\n|''Eggs-traordinary Adventure''\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|May 25, 2004\n|\n*2 bonus episodes\n*2 music videos\n*Granny's Activity Day Challenge\n|-\n|''4 Kid Favorites: Baby Looney Tunes''\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|January 17, 2012\n|\n*Menu Challenge: Baby Trivia\n*Menu Challenge: What's That Sound?\n|}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 4 volumes were released on DVD from July 15, 2013.

It is the first instalment of the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], and was originally intended to be called ''Race'n'Chase'' until the original concept was scrapped due to production issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igrandtheftauto.com/news/gta/389/original-gta-almost-scrapped./ |title=Original GTA almost scrapped |date=1 February 2011 |author1=TreeFitty |author2=DuPz0r |publisher=iGrandTheftAuto |accessdate=25 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820063528/http://www.igrandtheftauto.com/news/gta/389/original-gta-almost-scrapped./ |archivedate=20 August 2013 }}</ref> It is commonly assumed that this intial version was planned for the [[Amiga]], although designer Mike Dailly denies that an Amiga version was ever planned<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mdf200/status/1218884064171655168 |date=19 January 2020 |author1=Mike Dailly |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> but did suggest that a [[Sega Saturn]] version started development<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mdf200/status/1218888750996037633 |date=19 January 2020 |author1=Mike Dailly |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>. The game focuses on players taking on the role of a criminal who conducts jobs for various syndicates across three fictionalised versions of US cities, completing levels by achieving a set score, but within an open-world environment that allows them to do whatever they wish alongside jobs to achieve their goal.\n\nThe game was later re-released in December 1997 for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], which transformed it into a commercial success despite mixed reviews from critics. The success of ''Grand Theft Auto'' spawned a series of games, including several spin-offs, over the course of 16 years, with the game succeeded by ''[[Grand Theft Auto 2]]'' in October 1999.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:GTA1 PC in-game screenshot.png|thumb|left|A still image of gameplay, showing the top down view in [[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)|Liberty City]]]]\n''Grand Theft Auto'' is made up of six [[Level (video games)|levels]] split between three main cities - each city is based on a real-life city in the United States, with an alternative name: [[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)|Liberty City]] ([[New York City]]); Vice City ([[Miami]]); and [[San Andreas (Grand Theft Auto)#Setting|San Andreas]] ([[San Francisco]]) - with completing a level unlocking the next one in the chain. Players begin a game choosing a character from amongst eight - four in the PlayStation version - and naming them, though the choice is purely aesthetical, and doesn't effect overall gameplay. In each level, the player's ultimate objective is to reach a target number of [[Score (gaming)|points]], which starts at $1,000,000, but becomes higher in the later levels,<ref name=history/> and then reach the level's \"goal\" to complete the stage. The player is free to do whatever they want,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/adventure/grandtheftauto/review.html |title=Grand Theft Auto Review |date=6 May 1998 |last=Mac Donald |first=Ryan |work=[[GameSpot]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425225657/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/adventure/grandtheftauto/review.html |archivedate=25 April 2009 }}</ref> but have limited lives upon doing so. Points can be gained from anything, such as causing death and destruction amid the traffic in the city, completing special challenges, or stealing and sell cars for profit. However, the more typical means to achieve their target is to perform tasks for the level's local crime syndicate. Jobs can be initiated by visiting and touching a ringing [[telephone box]], with each level's set of jobs on offer being unique.<ref name=history>{{cite web|title=The complete history of Grand Theft Auto |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-complete-history-of-grand-theft-auto/ |website=Gamesradar |publisher=Future |accessdate=28 July 2015 |date=25 April 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223105253/http://www.gamesradar.com/the-complete-history-of-grand-theft-auto/ |archivedate=23 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\nJobs can be completed in any order, and each has some level of freedom to how it is successfully completed, though destinations in each are fixed. Successful completion of a job awards the player points, unlocks harder missions with greater rewards, and provides a \"multiplier\" - a bonus that increases the value of points earned from completing jobs and actions. Failing a job by not completing objectives, being arrested or dying, secures no points and can seal off other tasks in the chain. Players can find equipment across the level's map to help them with jobs and making points, including weapons and body armor, the latter increasing the player's survival against attacks from enemies. If the player is killed (referred to in the game as \"Wasted\"), they lose a life, lose all their current equipment, and have their multiplier bonus reset; losing all their lives will result in players having to restart a level. Law enforcement is present in each level, and doing criminal actions will cause the player to raise their notoriety with police; the higher the level, the tougher the response. If the player is arrested, they forfeit all equipment, and have their multiplier bonus halved.\n\nPC versions of the game were released with networked multiplayer gameplay using the [[Internetwork Packet Exchange|IPX protocol]].<ref name=\"manual-techdets\">{{cite book |title=Grand Theft Auto PC Edition Manual | page=4 | year=1997 | publisher=[[Take Two Interactive]] | author=DMA Design| author-link=DMA Design }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Race'n'Chase screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|Mock-up for ''Race'n'Chase'', the original title for ''Grand Theft Auto''.]]\nThe development of ''Grand Theft Auto'' began on 4 April 1995 at [[DMA Design]] in [[Dundee]].

It contained information about elements of the game discussed in various meetings held from 23 January 1995 to the writing of the document which also contains many similarities to the 1986 [[Commodore 64]] ''[[Miami Vice (video game)|Miami Vice]]''.\nAccording to the original design document, the introduction to ''Grand Theft Auto'' is a pre-drawn/rendered animation. The Windows 95 version was developed using Visual C++ v2.0. The DOS version was developed using Watcom C/C++ v10, Microsoft MASM 6.1 and Rational Systems DOS extender (DOS4GW) v 1.97.\nThe program used to make ''Grand Theft Auto'' was said to produce \"a 3D array which can [be] used by both the perspective and the isometric engines\". It was said to consist of \"a grid editor which is used to place blocks on a grid, with a [separate] grid for each level\", and \"allow any block to be placed at any level\". It was said that the world may have had to be 256\u00d7256\u00d76 blocks.\n\nThe original concept of ''Grand Theft Auto'' was \"to produce a fun, addictive and fast multi-player car racing and crashing game which uses a novel graphics method\".\n\nDavid Jones, the game's producer, cited ''[[Pac-Man]]'' as an influence. He noted that the player runs over pedestrians and gets chased by police in a similar manner to ''Pac-Man''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grand Theft Auto And Pac-Man? \"The Same\" |author=Brian Ashcraft |date=16 July 2009 |url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/07/grand-theft-auto-and-pac-man-the-same/ |accessdate=8 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706105956/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/07/grand-theft-auto-and-pac-man-the-same/ |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nGary Penn, creative director of DMA at the time, cited ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'' as a major influence, \"But I'd been working on Frontier, which is very different and there were definitely other people on the team who had things like Syndicate, Mercenary and Elite very much in their minds as well. That combination definitely led to the more open plan structure there is now. The game as it stands now is basically ''Elite'' in a city, but without quite the same sense of taking on the jobs. You take on the jobs in a slightly different way, but incredibly similar structurally. It's just a much more acceptable real world setting. The game was cops and robbers and then that evolved fairly quickly -- nobody wants to be the cop, it's more fun to be bad. And then that evolved into ''Grand Theft Auto''\".<ref name=\"garypenn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134644/the_replay_interviews_gary_penn.php |title=Gamasutra - Gary Penn interview |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728074620/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134644/the_replay_interviews_gary_penn.php |archivedate=28 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn an early 1997 interview, project leader Keith Hamilton commented, \"''GTA'' was harder than we thought.

The game focuses on players taking on the role of a criminal who conducts jobs for various syndicates across three fictionalised versions of US cities, completing levels by achieving a set score, but within an open-world environment that allows them to do whatever they wish alongside jobs to achieve their goal.\n\nThe game was later re-released in December 1997 for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], which transformed it into a commercial success despite mixed reviews from critics. The success of ''Grand Theft Auto'' spawned a series of games, including several spin-offs, over the course of 16 years, with the game succeeded by ''[[Grand Theft Auto 2]]'' in October 1999.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:GTA1 PC in-game screenshot.png|thumb|left|A still image of gameplay, showing the top down view in [[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)|Liberty City]]]]\n''Grand Theft Auto'' is made up of six [[Level (video games)|levels]] split between three main cities - each city is based on a real-life city in the United States, with an alternative name: [[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)|Liberty City]] ([[New York City]]); Vice City ([[Miami]]); and [[San Andreas (Grand Theft Auto)#Setting|San Andreas]] ([[San Francisco]]) - with completing a level unlocking the next one in the chain. Players begin a game choosing a character from amongst eight - four in the PlayStation version - and naming them, though the choice is purely aesthetical, and doesn't effect overall gameplay. In each level, the player's ultimate objective is to reach a target number of [[Score (gaming)|points]], which starts at $1,000,000, but becomes higher in the later levels,<ref name=history/> and then reach the level's \"goal\" to complete the stage. The player is free to do whatever they want,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/adventure/grandtheftauto/review.html |title=Grand Theft Auto Review |date=6 May 1998 |last=Mac Donald |first=Ryan |work=[[GameSpot]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425225657/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/adventure/grandtheftauto/review.html |archivedate=25 April 2009 }}</ref> but have limited lives upon doing so. Points can be gained from anything, such as causing death and destruction amid the traffic in the city, completing special challenges, or stealing and sell cars for profit. However, the more typical means to achieve their target is to perform tasks for the level's local crime syndicate. Jobs can be initiated by visiting and touching a ringing [[telephone box]], with each level's set of jobs on offer being unique.<ref name=history>{{cite web|title=The complete history of Grand Theft Auto |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-complete-history-of-grand-theft-auto/ |website=Gamesradar |publisher=Future |accessdate=28 July 2015 |date=25 April 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223105253/http://www.gamesradar.com/the-complete-history-of-grand-theft-auto/ |archivedate=23 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\nJobs can be completed in any order, and each has some level of freedom to how it is successfully completed, though destinations in each are fixed. Successful completion of a job awards the player points, unlocks harder missions with greater rewards, and provides a \"multiplier\" - a bonus that increases the value of points earned from completing jobs and actions. Failing a job by not completing objectives, being arrested or dying, secures no points and can seal off other tasks in the chain. Players can find equipment across the level's map to help them with jobs and making points, including weapons and body armor, the latter increasing the player's survival against attacks from enemies. If the player is killed (referred to in the game as \"Wasted\"), they lose a life, lose all their current equipment, and have their multiplier bonus reset; losing all their lives will result in players having to restart a level. Law enforcement is present in each level, and doing criminal actions will cause the player to raise their notoriety with police; the higher the level, the tougher the response. If the player is arrested, they forfeit all equipment, and have their multiplier bonus halved.\n\nPC versions of the game were released with networked multiplayer gameplay using the [[Internetwork Packet Exchange|IPX protocol]].<ref name=\"manual-techdets\">{{cite book |title=Grand Theft Auto PC Edition Manual | page=4 | year=1997 | publisher=[[Take Two Interactive]] | author=DMA Design| author-link=DMA Design }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Race'n'Chase screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|Mock-up for ''Race'n'Chase'', the original title for ''Grand Theft Auto''.]]\nThe development of ''Grand Theft Auto'' began on 4 April 1995 at [[DMA Design]] in [[Dundee]].

It contained information about elements of the game discussed in various meetings held from 23 January 1995 to the writing of the document which also contains many similarities to the 1986 [[Commodore 64]] ''[[Miami Vice (video game)|Miami Vice]]''.\nAccording to the original design document, the introduction to ''Grand Theft Auto'' is a pre-drawn/rendered animation. The Windows 95 version was developed using Visual C++ v2.0. The DOS version was developed using Watcom C/C++ v10, Microsoft MASM 6.1 and Rational Systems DOS extender (DOS4GW) v 1.97.\nThe program used to make ''Grand Theft Auto'' was said to produce \"a 3D array which can [be] used by both the perspective and the isometric engines\". It was said to consist of \"a grid editor which is used to place blocks on a grid, with a [separate] grid for each level\", and \"allow any block to be placed at any level\". It was said that the world may have had to be 256\u00d7256\u00d76 blocks.\n\nThe original concept of ''Grand Theft Auto'' was \"to produce a fun, addictive and fast multi-player car racing and crashing game which uses a novel graphics method\".\n\nDavid Jones, the game's producer, cited ''[[Pac-Man]]'' as an influence. He noted that the player runs over pedestrians and gets chased by police in a similar manner to ''Pac-Man''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grand Theft Auto And Pac-Man? \"The Same\" |author=Brian Ashcraft |date=16 July 2009 |url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/07/grand-theft-auto-and-pac-man-the-same/ |accessdate=8 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706105956/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/07/grand-theft-auto-and-pac-man-the-same/ |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nGary Penn, creative director of DMA at the time, cited ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'' as a major influence, \"But I'd been working on Frontier, which is very different and there were definitely other people on the team who had things like Syndicate, Mercenary and Elite very much in their minds as well. That combination definitely led to the more open plan structure there is now. The game as it stands now is basically ''Elite'' in a city, but without quite the same sense of taking on the jobs. You take on the jobs in a slightly different way, but incredibly similar structurally. It's just a much more acceptable real world setting. The game was cops and robbers and then that evolved fairly quickly -- nobody wants to be the cop, it's more fun to be bad.

The Game Boy Color version was technologically unabridged, which was quite a technical achievement{{original research inline|date=July 2012}} due to the sheer size of the cities, converted tile-for-tile from the PC original, making them many times larger than most Game Boy Color game worlds were because of the handheld's limited hardware. To cater for the target younger generation, however, the game was heavily censored, with gore and swearing removed.\n\nThe [[Personal computer|PC]] version comes in several different executables for DOS and MS-Windows, which use single set of data files (except for the 8-bit colour DOS version which uses different but similar graphics). It was previously available as a free download as part of the Rockstar Classics (alongside ''[[Wild Metal Country|Wild Metal]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto 2]]''), however the free download service is currently unavailable.<ref>{{cite web | title = Rockstar Classics | url = http://www.rockstargames.com/classics/ |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |accessdate = 25 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Grand Theft Auto'' was to be released on the [[Sega Saturn]], but due to the console's rapid decline in popularity before development was finished, the project was halted and the game was never released.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} After the PlayStation's successful release, development began on ''Grand Theft Auto 64'', a port of the game for the [[Nintendo 64]], rumoured to have graphical enhancements and new missions.

The next time the character enters a vehicle, a song from the CD will randomly play. This can also be done in the PlayStation port.\n\nThe game's main theme is \"Gangster Friday\" by Craig Conner, credited to the fictitious band Slumpussy, and is played on N-CT FM.<ref name=\"Manual-Soundtrack\"/> With the exception of Head Radio FM, the names of songs or the radio station names are never mentioned in-game. However, the soundtrack is listed in the booklet which comes with the game.<ref name=\"Manual-Soundtrack\"/>\n\nThe Collector's Edition of the PC version included the soundtrack on a separate CD.
