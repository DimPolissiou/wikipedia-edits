It is the thirteenth and third-last element in the [[lanthanide]] series. Like the other lanthanides, the most common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds; because it occurs so late in the series, however, the +2 oxidation state is also stabilized by the nearly full 4f shell that results. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble thulium compounds form [[coordination complex]]es with nine water molecules.\n\nIn 1879, the Swedish chemist [[Per Teodor Cleve]] separated from the rare earth oxide [[erbium(III) oxide|erbia]] another two previously unknown components, which he called [[holmium(III) oxide|holmia]] and [[thulium(III) oxide|thulia]]; these were the oxides of [[holmium]] and thulium, respectively. A relatively pure sample of thulium metal was first obtained in 1911.\n\nThulium is the second-least abundant of the [[lanthanide]]s, after radioactively unstable [[promethium]] which is only found in [[trace radioisotope|trace quantities]] on Earth. It is an easily workable [[metal]] with a bright silvery-gray luster. It is fairly soft and slowly [[tarnish]]es in air. Despite its high price and rarity, thulium is used as the radiation source in portable [[X-ray]] devices, and in some [[solid-state laser]]s. It has no significant biological role and is not particularly toxic.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Physical properties===\nPure thulium metal has a bright, silvery luster, which tarnishes on exposure to air.

In these, where about two-thirds of the total rare-earth content is yttrium, thulium is about 0.5% (or about tied with lutetium for rarity). The metal can be isolated through [[redox|reduction]] of its oxide with [[lanthanum]] metal or by [[calcium]] reduction in a closed container. None of thulium's natural [[chemical compound|compounds]] are commercially important. Approximately 50 tonnes per year of thulium oxide are produced.<ref name=history/> In 1996, thulium oxide cost US$20 per gram, and in 2005, 99%-pure thulium metal powder cost US$70 per gram.<ref name=CRC>{{cite book |author= Hammond, C.

It is the thirteenth and third-last element in the [[lanthanide]] series. Like the other lanthanides, the most common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds; because it occurs so late in the series, however, the +2 oxidation state is also stabilized by the nearly full 4f shell that results. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble thulium compounds form [[coordination complex]]es with nine water molecules.\n\nIn 1879, the Swedish chemist [[Per Teodor Cleve]] separated from the rare earth oxide [[erbium(III) oxide|erbia]] another two previously unknown components, which he called [[holmium(III) oxide|holmia]] and [[thulium(III) oxide|thulia]]; these were the oxides of [[holmium]] and thulium, respectively. A relatively pure sample of thulium metal was first obtained in 1911.\n\nThulium is the second-least abundant of the [[lanthanide]]s, after radioactively unstable [[promethium]] which is only found in [[trace radioisotope|trace quantities]] on Earth. It is an easily workable [[metal]] with a bright silvery-gray luster. It is fairly soft and slowly [[tarnish]]es in air. Despite its high price and rarity, thulium is used as the radiation source in portable [[X-ray]] devices, and in some [[solid-state laser]]s. It has no significant biological role and is not particularly toxic.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Physical properties===\nPure thulium metal has a bright, silvery luster, which tarnishes on exposure to air.

However, [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Greenland]], [[India]], [[Tanzania]], and the [[United States]] also have large reserves of thulium.

Thulium is the least abundant [[lanthanide]] on earth except for the radioactive [[promethium]].<ref name=history/>\n\n==Production==\nThulium is principally extracted from [[monazite]] ores (~0.007% thulium) found in river sands, through [[ion exchange]]. Newer ion-exchange and solvent-extraction techniques have led to easier separation of the rare earths, which has yielded much lower costs for thulium production. The principal sources today are the ion [[adsorption]] clays of southern China. In these, where about two-thirds of the total rare-earth content is yttrium, thulium is about 0.5% (or about tied with lutetium for rarity). The metal can be isolated through [[redox|reduction]] of its oxide with [[lanthanum]] metal or by [[calcium]] reduction in a closed container. None of thulium's natural [[chemical compound|compounds]] are commercially important. Approximately 50 tonnes per year of thulium oxide are produced.<ref name=history/> In 1996, thulium oxide cost US$20 per gram, and in 2005, 99%-pure thulium metal powder cost US$70 per gram.<ref name=CRC>{{cite book |author= Hammond, C.

Vestiges from this period (city walls and ruins of Roman baths) still remain.\n[[Julius Caesar]] called it [[Liberalitas]] Julia (Julian generosity). The city grew in importance because it lay at the junction of several important routes. During his travels through [[Gaul]] and [[Lusitania]], [[Pliny the Elder]] also visited this town and mentioned it in his book ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' as Ebora Cerealis, because of its many surrounding wheat fields. In those days, \u00c9vora became a flourishing city. Its high rank among municipalities in Roman [[Hispania]] is clearly shown by many inscriptions and coins. The [[Roman Temple of \u00c9vora|monumental Corinthian temple]] in the centre of the town dates from the first century and was probably erected in honour of emperor [[Augustus]]. In the fourth century, the town had already a bishop, named Quintianus.\n\nDuring the [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]], \u00c9vora came under the rule of the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]]ic king [[Liuvigild|Leovigild]] in 584. The town was later raised to the status of a cathedral city. Nevertheless, this was a time of decline and very few [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] from this period remain.\n\n=== Moorish rule ===\nIn 715, the city was conquered by the [[Moors]] under [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]] who called it '''Yaburah \u064a\u0627\u0628\u0631\u0629'''. During the Moorish rule (715\u20131165), the town, part of the [[Taifa of Badajoz]], slowly began to prosper again and developed into an agricultural center with a fortress and a mosque. The present character of the city is evidence of the Moorish influence. During that time, several notables hailed from Evora, including [[Abd al-Majid ibn Abdun|Abd al-Majid ibn Abdun Al-Yaburi]] \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0628\u0631\u064a, a poet whose [[Diwan (poetry)|diwan]] still survives to this day.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720011642/http://libraries.najah.edu/ar/node/108442 ]</ref>\n\n=== Reconquest ===\n\u00c9vora was wrested from the Moors through a surprise attack by [[Gerald the Fearless]] (Geraldo Sem Pavor) in September 1165. The town came under the rule of the Portuguese king [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso I]] in 1166. It then flourished as one of the most dynamic cities in the Kingdom of Portugal during the [[Middle Ages]], especially in the 15th century. The court of the first and second dynasties resided here for long periods, constructing palaces, monuments and religious buildings. \u00c9vora became the scene for many royal weddings and a site where many important decisions were made.\n\n=== Manueline favour ===\n[[File:Porta de Aviz (litografia, 1839 - 1847).jpg|thumb|right|260px|In the 19th century, \u00c9vora declined in national power, as a result of the [[Liberal Wars|War of Two Brothers]].]]\nParticularly thriving during the Avis Dynasty (1385\u20131580), especially under the reign of [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] and [[John III of Portugal|John III]], \u00c9vora became a major centre for the [[Renaissance humanism|humanities]] ([[Andr\u00e9 de Resende]] - buried in the cathedral) and artists, such as the sculptor [[Nicolau Chanterene]]; the painters [[Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o de Figueiredo]] and [[Greg\u00f3rio Lopes]]; the composers [[Manuel Cardoso]] and [[Duarte Lobo]]; the [[chronicler]] Duarte Galv\u00e3o; and the father of Portuguese drama, [[Gil Vicente]].\n\n\u00c9vora also held a large part of the [[Slavery in Portugal|slave population of Portugal]]. [[Nicolas Cleynaerts|Nicolas Clenard]], a Flemish tutor at the Portuguese court, exclaimed in 1535 that \"In \u00c9vora, it was as if I had been carried off to a city in hell: everywhere I only meet blacks.\"\n\nThe city became the seat of an archbishopric in 1540. The [[University of \u00c9vora|university]] was founded by the [[Jesuits]] in 1559, and it was here that great European Masters such as the Flemish humanists [[Clenardus|Nicolaus Clenardus]] (Nicolaas Cleynaerts) (1493\u20131542), [[Johannes Vasaeus]] (Jan Was) (1511\u20131561) and the theologian [[Luis de Molina]] passed on their knowledge. In the 18th century, the Jesuits, who had spread intellectual and religious enlightenment since the 16th century, were expelled from Portugal, the university was closed in 1759 by the [[Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo, Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], and \u00c9vora went into decline. The university was only reopened in 1973.\n\n=== Recent history ===\n[[File:VistaDe\u00c9vora134.jpg|thumb|right|260px|View of a street in \u00c9vora.]]\nThe [[Battle of \u00c9vora (1808)|Battle of \u00c9vora]] was fought on 29 July 1808 during the [[Peninsular War]]. An outnumbered Portuguese-Spanish force of 2,500, assisted by poorly armed peasant militiamen, tried to stop a French-Spanish division commanded by [[Louis Henri Loison]] but it was routed. Led by the hated Loison, known as ''Maneta'' or One-Hand, the French went on to storm the town which was defended by soldiers, militiamen and armed townsmen. Breaking into the town, the attackers slaughtered combatants and non-combatants alike before thoroughly pillaging the place.  The French inflicted as many as 8,000 casualties while suffering only 290 of their own.<ref>Jac Weller, ''Wellington in the Peninsula'', Kaye & Ward, p34</ref>\n\nIn 1834, \u00c9vora was the site of the surrender of the forces of [[Miguel I of Portugal|King Miguel I]], which marked the end of the [[Liberal Wars]]. The many monuments erected by major artists of each period now testify to \u00c9vora's lively cultural and rich artistic and historical heritage. The variety of architectural styles ([[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Manueline]], [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]]), the palaces and the picturesque labyrinth of squares and narrow streets of the city centre are all part of the rich heritage of this museum-city.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\n\u00c9vora (altitude 300&nbsp;m) is situated in [[Alentejo]], a large region of wide plains on the south of [[Portugal]], bordered on the North by the [[Tagus River]] and on the South by the region of [[Algarve]]. The city is {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=on}} from the capital city [[Lisbon]], and {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Badajoz]] at the Spanish border. It is the chief city of the region. The seat of the municipality is the city of \u00c9vora, composed by the [[freguesia|civil parishes]] of [[\u00c9vora (S\u00e3o Mamede, S\u00e9, S\u00e3o Pedro e Santo Ant\u00e3o)]] in the historical centre and the urban parishes of Bacelo e Senhora da Sa\u00fade and Malagueira e Horta das Figueiras outside the ancient city walls where most of the population in fact reside. The remaining civil parishes in the municipality are rural or suburban and do not form part of the city for statistic purposes. The city's historical centre has about 4,000 buildings and an area of {{convert|1.05|km2|2|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Climate===\n\u00c9vora has a hot-summer [[mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Csa'') with hot, dry summers and mild, moist winters.

Vestiges from this period (city walls and ruins of Roman baths) still remain.\n[[Julius Caesar]] called it [[Liberalitas]] Julia (Julian generosity). The city grew in importance because it lay at the junction of several important routes. During his travels through [[Gaul]] and [[Lusitania]], [[Pliny the Elder]] also visited this town and mentioned it in his book ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' as Ebora Cerealis, because of its many surrounding wheat fields. In those days, \u00c9vora became a flourishing city. Its high rank among municipalities in Roman [[Hispania]] is clearly shown by many inscriptions and coins. The [[Roman Temple of \u00c9vora|monumental Corinthian temple]] in the centre of the town dates from the first century and was probably erected in honour of emperor [[Augustus]]. In the fourth century, the town had already a bishop, named Quintianus.\n\nDuring the [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]], \u00c9vora came under the rule of the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]]ic king [[Liuvigild|Leovigild]] in 584. The town was later raised to the status of a cathedral city. Nevertheless, this was a time of decline and very few [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] from this period remain.\n\n=== Moorish rule ===\nIn 715, the city was conquered by the [[Moors]] under [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]] who called it '''Yaburah \u064a\u0627\u0628\u0631\u0629'''. During the Moorish rule (715\u20131165), the town, part of the [[Taifa of Badajoz]], slowly began to prosper again and developed into an agricultural center with a fortress and a mosque. The present character of the city is evidence of the Moorish influence. During that time, several notables hailed from Evora, including [[Abd al-Majid ibn Abdun|Abd al-Majid ibn Abdun Al-Yaburi]] \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0628\u0631\u064a, a poet whose [[Diwan (poetry)|diwan]] still survives to this day.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720011642/http://libraries.najah.edu/ar/node/108442 ]</ref>\n\n=== Reconquest ===\n\u00c9vora was wrested from the Moors through a surprise attack by [[Gerald the Fearless]] (Geraldo Sem Pavor) in September 1165. The town came under the rule of the Portuguese king [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso I]] in 1166. It then flourished as one of the most dynamic cities in the Kingdom of Portugal during the [[Middle Ages]], especially in the 15th century. The court of the first and second dynasties resided here for long periods, constructing palaces, monuments and religious buildings. \u00c9vora became the scene for many royal weddings and a site where many important decisions were made.\n\n=== Manueline favour ===\n[[File:Porta de Aviz (litografia, 1839 - 1847).jpg|thumb|right|260px|In the 19th century, \u00c9vora declined in national power, as a result of the [[Liberal Wars|War of Two Brothers]].]]\nParticularly thriving during the Avis Dynasty (1385\u20131580), especially under the reign of [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] and [[John III of Portugal|John III]], \u00c9vora became a major centre for the [[Renaissance humanism|humanities]] ([[Andr\u00e9 de Resende]] - buried in the cathedral) and artists, such as the sculptor [[Nicolau Chanterene]]; the painters [[Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o de Figueiredo]] and [[Greg\u00f3rio Lopes]]; the composers [[Manuel Cardoso]] and [[Duarte Lobo]]; the [[chronicler]] Duarte Galv\u00e3o; and the father of Portuguese drama, [[Gil Vicente]].\n\n\u00c9vora also held a large part of the [[Slavery in Portugal|slave population of Portugal]]. [[Nicolas Cleynaerts|Nicolas Clenard]], a Flemish tutor at the Portuguese court, exclaimed in 1535 that \"In \u00c9vora, it was as if I had been carried off to a city in hell: everywhere I only meet blacks.\"\n\nThe city became the seat of an archbishopric in 1540. The [[University of \u00c9vora|university]] was founded by the [[Jesuits]] in 1559, and it was here that great European Masters such as the Flemish humanists [[Clenardus|Nicolaus Clenardus]] (Nicolaas Cleynaerts) (1493\u20131542), [[Johannes Vasaeus]] (Jan Was) (1511\u20131561) and the theologian [[Luis de Molina]] passed on their knowledge. In the 18th century, the Jesuits, who had spread intellectual and religious enlightenment since the 16th century, were expelled from Portugal, the university was closed in 1759 by the [[Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo, Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], and \u00c9vora went into decline. The university was only reopened in 1973.\n\n=== Recent history ===\n[[File:VistaDe\u00c9vora134.jpg|thumb|right|260px|View of a street in \u00c9vora.]]\nThe [[Battle of \u00c9vora (1808)|Battle of \u00c9vora]] was fought on 29 July 1808 during the [[Peninsular War]]. An outnumbered Portuguese-Spanish force of 2,500, assisted by poorly armed peasant militiamen, tried to stop a French-Spanish division commanded by [[Louis Henri Loison]] but it was routed. Led by the hated Loison, known as ''Maneta'' or One-Hand, the French went on to storm the town which was defended by soldiers, militiamen and armed townsmen. Breaking into the town, the attackers slaughtered combatants and non-combatants alike before thoroughly pillaging the place.  The French inflicted as many as 8,000 casualties while suffering only 290 of their own.<ref>Jac Weller, ''Wellington in the Peninsula'', Kaye & Ward, p34</ref>\n\nIn 1834, \u00c9vora was the site of the surrender of the forces of [[Miguel I of Portugal|King Miguel I]], which marked the end of the [[Liberal Wars]]. The many monuments erected by major artists of each period now testify to \u00c9vora's lively cultural and rich artistic and historical heritage. The variety of architectural styles ([[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Manueline]], [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]]), the palaces and the picturesque labyrinth of squares and narrow streets of the city centre are all part of the rich heritage of this museum-city.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\n\u00c9vora (altitude 300&nbsp;m) is situated in [[Alentejo]], a large region of wide plains on the south of [[Portugal]], bordered on the North by the [[Tagus River]] and on the South by the region of [[Algarve]].
