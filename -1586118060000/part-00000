The war, which lasted from 1990 to 1994, arose from the long-running dispute between the [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] groups within the Rwandan population. A [[Rwandan Revolution|1959\u20131962 revolution]] had replaced the [[Kingdom of Rwanda|Tutsi monarchy]] with a Hutu-led republic, forcing more than 336,000 Tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. A group of these refugees in [[Uganda]] founded the RPF which, under the leadership of [[Fred Rwigyema]] and [[Paul Kagame]], became a battle-ready army by the late 1980s.\n\nThe war began on 1 October 1990 when the RPF invaded north-eastern Rwanda, advancing {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} into the country. They suffered a major setback when Rwigyema was killed in action on the second day. The Rwandan Army, assisted by troops from France, gained the upper hand and the RPF were largely defeated by the end of October. Kagame, who had been in the United States during the invasion, returned to take command. He withdrew troops to the [[Virunga Mountains]] for several months before attacking again. The RPF began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]], which continued until mid-1992 with neither side able to gain the upper hand. A series of protests forced Rwandan President [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] to begin peace negotiations with the RPF and domestic opposition parties. Despite disruption and killings by [[Hutu Power]], a group of extremists opposed to any deal, and a fresh RPF offensive in early 1993, the negotiations were successfully concluded with the signing of the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] in August 1993.\n\nAn uneasy peace followed, during which the terms of the accords were gradually implemented. RPF troops were deployed to a compound in Kigali and the peace-keeping [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR) was sent to the country. But the Hutu Power movement was steadily gaining influence and planned a \"final solution\" to exterminate the Tutsi. This plan was put into action following the [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|assassination of President Habyarimana]] on 6 April 1994. Over the course of about 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed in the [[Rwandan genocide]]. The RPF quickly resumed the civil war. They captured territory steadily, encircling cities and cutting off supply routes. By mid-June they had surrounded the capital, [[Kigali]], and on 4 July they seized it. The war ended later that month when the RPF captured the last territory held by the interim government, forcing the government and ''genocidaires'' into [[Zaire]].\n\nThe victorious RPF assumed control of the country, with Paul Kagame as de facto leader. Kagame served as [[Vice President of Rwanda|vice president]] from 1994 and as president from 2000. The RPF began a programme of rebuilding the infrastructure and economy of the country, bringing genocide perpetrators to trial, and promoting reconciliation between Hutu and Tutsi. In 1996 the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched an offensive against refugee camps in Zaire, home to exiled leaders of the former regime and millions of Hutu refugees. This action started the [[First Congo War]], which removed long-time dictator President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] from power. As of 2019, Kagame and the RPF remain the dominant political force in Rwanda.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Pre-independence Rwanda and origins of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa===\n{{main|Origins of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa}}\n[[File:Rwanda Nyanza Mwami Palace.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of the [[King of Rwanda]]'s palace at [[Nyanza, Rwanda|Nyanza]]|alt=Photograph of King's palace in Nyanza, Rwanda depicting main entrance, front and conical roof]]\nThe earliest inhabitants of what is now [[Rwanda]] were the [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] hunter-gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=44}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups migrated into the region and began to clear forest land for agriculture.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=58}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their land and moved to the slopes of mountains.{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} Historians have several theories regarding the Bantu migrations. One theory is that the first settlers were [[Hutu]], and the [[Tutsi]] migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly originating from the [[Horn of Africa]].{{sfn|Pottier|2002|p=12}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=16}} An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=58}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} Under this theory the Hutu and Tutsi are a later class, rather than a racial,  distinction.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=69}}{{sfn|Shyaka|2004|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe population coalesced, first into [[Clans of Rwanda|clans]] (''ubwoko''){{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=88\u201389}} and by 1700 into around eight kingdoms.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=482}} The [[Kingdom of Rwanda]], ruled by the Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became dominant from the mid-eighteenth century,{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} expanding through conquest and assimilation.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=38}} It achieved its greatest extent under the reign of [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli Rwabugiri]] in 1853\u20131895. Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north, and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} {{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} These included ''uburetwa'', a system of forced labour which Hutu had to perform to regain access to land seized from them,{{sfn|Pottier|2002|p=13}} and ''[[ubuhake]]'', under which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=13\u201314}} Rwanda and neighbouring [[Burundi]] were assigned to Germany by the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin Conference]] of 1884,{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=218}} and Germany established a presence in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the King.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=24}} German policy was to rule through the Rwandan monarchy, enabling colonisation with fewer European troops.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=25}} The colonists favoured the Tutsi over the Hutu when assigning administrative roles, believing them to be migrants from Ethiopia and racially superior.{{sfn|Jones|2001|p=17}} The Rwandan King welcomed the Germans, and used their military strength to reinforce his rule and expand the kingdom.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=217\u2013218}} [[East African Campaign (World War I)|Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi]] during World War I,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=25\u201326}} and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=26}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=260}} The Belgian administration, in conjunction with Catholic clerics, modernised the local economy.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=32\u201335}} They also increased taxes and imposed forced labour on the population.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=35}} Tutsi supremacy remained, reinforced by Belgium's enthusiastic support of the monarchy, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=38\u201339}} In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards classifying each individual as Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. It had previously been possible for wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, but the identity cards prevented further movement between the groups.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n===Revolution, exile of Tutsi, and the Hutu republic===\n{{main|Rwandan Revolution}}\nAfter 1945 a Hutu counter-elite developed,{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=108}} demanding the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=45\u201346}} The Tutsi leadership responded by trying to negotiate a speedy independence on their terms but found the Belgians no longer supported them.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=43}}{{sfn|Kroslak|2007|p=24}} There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=43\u201344}} with prominent conservative figures in the early Rwandan church replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these a greater proportion were [[Flemish people|Flemish]] rather than [[Walloons|Walloon]] Belgians and sympathised with the plight of the Hutu.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=113}} In November 1959 the Hutu began a series of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes, following false rumours of the death of a Hutu sub-chief in an assault by Tutsi activists.{{sfn|Carney|2013|pp=124\u2013125}} Violence quickly spread across the whole country, beginning the [[Rwandan Revolution]].{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=125}} The King and Tutsi politicians launched a counter-attack{{sfn|Newbury|1988|p=196}} in an attempt to seize power and ostracise the Hutu and Belgians,{{sfn|Newbury|1988|pp=195\u2013196}} but were thwarted by Belgian Colonel [[Guy Logiest]], who was brought in by the colonial Governor.{{sfn|Newbury|1988|p=196}} Logiest re-established law and order and began a programme of overt promotion and protection of the Hutu elite.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=127}} He replaced many Tutsi chiefs with Hutu and effectively forced [[Kigeli V of Rwanda|King Kigeli V]] into exile.{{sfn|Sabar|2013}}\n\n[[File:Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana (1980).jpg|thumb| Hutu army officer [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] (pictured) became President of Rwanda after [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a 1973 coup]].]]\nLogiest and Hutu leader [[Gr\u00e9goire Kayibanda]] declared the country an autonomous republic in 1961 and it became independent in 1962.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=53\u201354}} More than 336,000 Tutsi left Rwanda by 1964 to escape the Hutu purges,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=62}}{{sfn|Mayersen|2010|p=21}} mostly to the neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, [[Tanzania]] and Zaire.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|pp=160\u2013161}} Many of the Tutsi exiles lived as refugees in their host countries,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=63\u201364}} and sought to return to Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=55}} Some supported the new Rwandan Government, but others formed armed groups and launched attacks on Rwanda,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=55}} the largest of which advanced close to Kigali in 1963.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=56}} These groups were known in [[Kinyarwanda]] as the ''inyenzi'' (cockroaches).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=54}} Historians do not know the origin of this term \u2013 it is possible the rebels coined it themselves, the name reflecting the fact that they generally attacked at night.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=34}} The ''inyenzi'' label resurfaced in the 1990s as a highly derogatory term for the Tutsi, used by Hutu hardliners to dehumanise them.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=34}} The ''inyenzi'' attacks of the 1960s were poorly equipped and organised and the government defeated them. The last significant attack was made in desperation from Burundi in December 1963 but failed due to bad planning and lack of equipment. The government responded to this attack with the slaughter of an estimated 10,000 Tutsi within Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=56}}\n\nKayibanda presided over a Hutu republic for the next decade, imposing an autocratic rule similar to the pre-revolution feudal monarchy.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=57}} In 1973 Hutu army officer [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] toppled Kayibanda in [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=74\u201376}} He founded the [[National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development]] (MRND) party in 1975,{{sfn|Twagilimana|2007|p=117}} and promulgated a new constitution following a [[Rwandan constitutional referendum, 1978|1978 referendum]], making the country a [[one-party state]] in which every citizen had to belong to the MRND.{{sfn|Twagilimana|2007|p=116}} Anti-Tutsi discrimination continued under Habyarimana but the country enjoyed greater economic prosperity and reduced anti-Tutsi violence.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=74\u201376}} A coffee price collapse in the late 1980s caused a loss of income for Rwanda's wealthy elite, precipitating a political fight for power and access to [[foreign aid]] receipts.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=84}} The family of first lady [[Agathe Habyarimana]], known as the ''[[akazu]]'', were the principal winners in this fight.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=85}} The family had a more respected lineage than that of the President, having ruled one of the independent states near [[Gisenyi]] in the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=86}} Habyarimana therefore relied on them in controlling the population of the north-west.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=86}} The ''akazu'' exploited this to their advantage, and Habyarimana was increasingly unable to rule without them.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=86}} The economic situation forced Habyarimana to greatly reduce the [[national budget]], which led to civil unrest.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=87\u201389}} On the advice of French president [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], Habyarimana declared a commitment to [[Multi-party system|multi-party politics]] but took no action to bring this about.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=90}} Student protests followed and by late 1990 the country was in crisis.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=90}}\n\n=== Formation of the RPF and preparation for war ===\nThe organisation which became the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) was founded in 1979 in Uganda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=67}} It was initially known as the Rwandan Refugees Welfare Association and then from 1980 as the Rwandan Alliance for National Unity (RANU).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=67}} It formed in response to persecution and discrimination against the Tutsi refugees by the regime of Ugandan President [[Milton Obote]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=67}} Obote accused the Rwandans of collaboration with his predecessor, [[Idi Amin]], including occupying the homes and stealing the cattle of Ugandans who had fled from Amin.{{sfn|Dash|1983}} Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees [[Fred Rwigyema]] and [[Paul Kagame]] had joined [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s rebel [[Front for National Salvation]] (FRONASA).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=68}} Museveni [[Uganda\u2013Tanzania War|fought alongside Obote]] to defeat Amin in 1979 but withdrew from the government following Obote's disputed victory in the [[Ugandan general election, 1980|1980 general election]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}} With Rwigyema and Kagame he formed a new rebel army, the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA).{{sfn|Associated Press (I)|1981}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}} The NRA's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in what became known as the [[Ugandan Bush War]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}}{{sfn|Nganda|2009}} President Obote remained hostile to the Rwandan refugees throughout his presidency and RANU was forced into exile in 1981, relocating to [[Nairobi]] in Kenya.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=63}} In 1982, with the authority of Obote,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=69}} local district councils in the [[Ankole]] region issued notices requiring refugees to be evicted from their homes and settled in camps.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=19}} These evictions were violently implemented by Ankole youth militia.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=69}} Many displaced Rwandans attempted to cross the border to Rwanda, but the Habyarimana regime confined them to isolated camps and closed the border to prevent further migration.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=22}} Faced with the threat of statelessness,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=22}} many more Tutsi refugees in Uganda chose to join Museveni's NRA.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=24}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=70}}\n[[File:ReaganMuseveni.jpg|thumb|Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] meeting with [[Ronald Reagan]] at the [[White House]] in October 1987]]\nIn 1986 the NRA [[Battle of Kampala|captured Kampala]] with a force of 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=47}} After Museveni was inaugurated as president he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Simpson (I)|2000}} The experience of the Bush War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, with the goal of allowing the refugees to return home.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=51\u201352}} As well as fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=51\u201352}} With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala.{{sfn|Wells|Fellows|2016|p=29}} At its 1987 convention it renamed itself to the Rwandan Patriotic Front and it too committed to returning the refugees to Rwanda by any means possible.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=72\u201373}} In 1988 a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing [[Peter Bayingana]] as RPF president.{{sfn|Bamurangirwa|2013|p=80}} Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, Kagame assuming the vice presidency.{{sfn|Bamurangirwa|2013|p=80}} Bayingana remained as the other vice president but resented the loss of the leadership.{{sfn|Bamurangirwa|2013|p=80}} Bayingana and his supporters attempted to start the war with an invasion in late 1989 without the support of Rwigyema,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=34}} but this was quickly repelled by the Rwandan Army.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=31}}\n\nRwandan President Habyarimana was aware of the increasing number of Tutsi exiles in the Ugandan Army and made representations to President Museveni on the matter.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=53}} At the same time many native Ugandans and [[Baganda]] officers in the NRA began criticising Museveni over his appointment of Rwandan refugees to senior positions.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=33}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=175}} He therefore demoted Kagame and Rwigyema in 1989.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=53}} They remained de facto senior officers but the change in official status, and the possibility that they might lose access to the resources of the Ugandan military,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=34}} caused them to accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=53\u201354}} In 1990 a dispute in south-western Uganda between Ugandan ranch owners and squatters on their land, many of whom were Rwandans,{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=176}} led to a wider debate on indigeneity and eventually to the explicit labeling of all Rwandan refugees as non-citizens.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=182}} Realising the precariousness of their own positions, the opportunity afforded by both the renewed drive of refugees to leave Uganda, and the instability on the Rwandan domestic scene, Rwigyema and Kagame decided in mid-1990 to effect their invasion plans immediately.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=57}} It is likely that President Museveni knew of the planned invasion but did not explicitly support it.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=97\u201398}} In mid-1990 Museveni ordered Rwigyema to attend an officer training course at the [[Command and General Staff College]] in [[Fort Leavenworth]] in the United States, and was also planning overseas deployments for other senior Rwandans in the army.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=61}} This may have been a tactic to reduce the threat of an RPF invasion of Rwanda.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=61}} After two days of discussion Rwigyema persuaded Museveni that following years of army duty he needed a break and was allowed to remain in Uganda.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=61\u201362}} Museveni then ordered Kagame to attend instead. The RPF leadership allowed him to go, to avoid suspicion, even though it meant his missing the beginning of the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=62}}\n\n== Course of the war ==\n\n=== 1990 invasion and death of Rwigyema ===\nOn 1 October 1990 fifty RPF rebels deserted their Ugandan Army posts and crossed the border from Uganda into Rwanda, killing a Rwandan customs guard at the Kagitumba border post and forcing others to flee.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=93}} They were followed by hundreds more rebels, dressed in the uniforms of the [[Uganda People's Defence Force|Ugandan national army]] and carrying stolen Ugandan weaponry, including [[machine gun]]s, [[autocannon]]s, [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]], and Soviet [[BM-21 Grad|BM-21 multiple rocket launchers]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=93}} According to RPF estimates, around 2,500 of the Ugandan Army's 4,000 Rwandan soldiers took part in the invasion,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=93}} accompanied by 800 civilians, including medical staff and messengers.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=65}} Both President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Habyarimana of Rwanda were in [[New York City]] attending the United Nations [[World Summit for Children]].{{sfn|Biles|1990}} In the first few days of fighting, the RPF advanced {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} south to [[Gabiro]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=94}} Their [[Rwandan Armed Forces]] opponents, fighting for Habyarimana's government, were numerically superior, with 5,200 soldiers, and possessed armoured cars and helicopters supplied by France, but the RPF benefited from the element of surprise.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=94}} The Ugandan government set up roadblocks across the west of Uganda, to prevent further desertions and to block the rebels from returning to Uganda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=94}}\n\nOn 2 October the RPF leader Fred Rwigyema was shot in the head and killed. The exact circumstances of Rwigyema's death are disputed; the official line of Kagame's government,{{sfn|Government of Rwanda|2009}} and the version mentioned by historian [[G\u00e9rard Prunier]] in his 1995 book on the subject, was that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=95\u201396}} In his 2009 book ''Africa's World War'', Prunier states that Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=13\u201314}} According to this account, Rwigyema was conscious of the need to move slowly and attempt to win over the Hutu in Rwanda before assaulting Kigali, whereas Bayingana and fellow subcommander [[Chris Bunyenyezi]] wished to strike hard and fast, to achieve power as soon as possible. The argument boiled over, causing Bayingana to shoot Rwigyema dead.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=13\u201314}} Another senior RPF officer, [[Stephen Nduguta]], witnessed this shooting and informed President Museveni; Museveni sent his brother [[Salim Saleh]] to investigate, and Saleh ordered Bayingana's and Bunyenyezi's arrests and eventual executions.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=14}}\n\nWhen news of the RPF offensive broke, Habyarimana requested assistance from France in fighting the invasion.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} The French president's son, [[Jean-Christophe Mitterrand]], was head of the government's Africa Cell and promised to send troops.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} On the night of 4 October, gunfire was heard in Kigali in a mysterious attack, which was attributed to RPF commandos. The attack was most likely staged by the Rwandan authorities, seeking to convince the French that the regime was in imminent danger.{{refn|group=note|Many sources report that the attack was staged:{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=102}}{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} Andr\u00e9 Guichaoua also finds that the most convincing explanation, but writes that it remains open to debate.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=34}}}} As a result, 600 French soldiers arrived in Rwanda the following day, twice as many as initially pledged.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} The French operation was code-named [[Op\u00e9ration Noro\u00eet|Noro\u00eet]] and its official purpose was to protect French nationals.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|p=27}} In reality the mission was to support Habyarimana's regime and the French parachute companies immediately set up positions blocking the RPF advance to the capital and [[Kigali International Airport]].{{sfn|Melvern|2000|p=14}} Belgium and Zaire also sent troops to Kigali in early October.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=101}} The Belgian troops were deployed primarily to defend the country's citizens living in Rwanda but after a few days it became clear that they were not in danger. Instead, the deployment created a political controversy as news reached Brussels of arbitrary arrests and massacres by the Habyarimana regime and its failure to deal with the underlying causes of the war.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=107}} Faced with a growing domestic dispute over the issue, and no with no obvious prospect of achieving peace, the Belgian government withdrew its troops by the beginning of November.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=107\u2013108}} Belgium provided no further military support to the Habyarimana government.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=88}} Zairian President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s contribution was to send several hundred troops of the elite [[Special Presidential Division]] (DSP).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=101}} Unlike the French, the Zairian troops went straight to the front line and began fighting the RPF,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=101}} but their discipline was poor.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=109}} The Zairian soldiers raped Rwandan civilians in the north of the country and looted their homes,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=109}} prompting Habyarimana to expel them back to Zaire within a week of their arrival.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=78}} With French assistance, and benefiting from the loss of RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the Rwandan Army enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF and pushed the rebels all the way back to the Ugandan border.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=96}} Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda and others went into hiding in the [[Akagera National Park]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=96}} Habyarimana accused the Ugandan Government of supplying the RPF, establishing a \"rear command\" for the group in Kampala, and \"flagging off\" the invasion.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=116}} The Rwandan Government announced on 30 October that the war was over.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=96}}\n\nThe Rwandan Government used the attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for the arbitrary arrest of more than 8,000 mostly Tutsi political opponents.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=34}} Tutsi were increasingly viewed with suspicion; [[Radio Rwanda]] aired incitement to ethnic hatred and a pogrom was organised on 11 October in a commune in [[Gisenyi Province]], killing 383 Tutsi.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=16}} It was the first time in nearly twenty years that massacres against Tutsi were perpetrated,{{sfn|Longman|2017|p=126}} as anti-Tutsi violence under the Habyarimana regime had been low level only up to that point.{{sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica}}\n\n=== Kagame's reorganisation of the RPF ===\n[[File:RwandaVolcanoAndLake cropped2.jpg|thumb|The [[Virunga Mountains]], the RPF base from 1990 to 1991|alt=Photograph of a lake with one of the Virunga Mountains behind, partially in cloud]]\nPaul Kagame was still in the United States at the time of the outbreak of war, attending the military training course in Fort Leavenworth.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=64}} He and Rwigyema had been in frequent contact by telephone throughout his stay in Kansas, planning the final details for the October invasion.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=63}} At the end of September Kagame informed the college that he was leaving the course, and was settling his affairs ready to return to Africa as the invasion began.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=64}} The college allowed him to leave with several textbooks, which he later used in planning tactics for the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=64}} When Kagame learned of Rwigyema's death on 5 October, he departed immediately to take command of the RPF troops.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=67}} He flew through [[London]] and [[Addis Ababa]] to [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe Airport]], where he was given safe passage by a friend in the Ugandan secret service;{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=75\u201376}} the police considered arresting him, but with Museveni out of the country and no specific orders, they allowed him to pass.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}} Ugandan associates drove Kagame to the border and he crossed into Rwanda early on 15 October.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}}\n\nThe RPF were in disarray by the time Kagame arrived, with troop morale very low.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}} He later described his arrival as one of the worst experiences of his life; the troops lacked organisation following Rwigyema's death and were demoralised after their losses in the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}} Kagame was well known to the RPF troops, many of whom had fought with him in the Ugandan Army, and they welcomed his arrival in the field.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=78\u201379}} He spent the following weeks gathering intelligence with senior officers.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=79}} By the end of October, with the RPF forced back to the Ugandan border, Kagame decided it was futile to continue fighting.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=79}} He therefore withdrew most of the army from north-eastern Rwanda, moving them to the [[Virunga mountains]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=79}} Kagame knew that the rugged terrain of the Virungas offered protection from attacks, even if the RPF's position was discovered.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=114\u2013115}} The march west took almost a week during which the soldiers crossed the border into Uganda several times, with the permission of President Museveni, taking advantage of personal friendships between the RPF soldiers and their ex-colleagues in the Ugandan Army.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=80}}\n\nMeanwhile, some RPF soldiers remained as a [[Decoy#Military decoy|decoy]] to carry out small-scale attacks on the Rwandan Army, who remained unaware of the Front's relocation.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=80}} The reorientation towards [[guerrilla warfare]] began with a raid on a Rwandan customs post across the border from [[Katuna]].{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|pp=112\u2013113}} Following the attack, the Rwandan Government accused Uganda of deliberately sheltering the RPF.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=114}} The RPF's new tactics inflicted heavy casualties on the Rwandan Army, which reacted by shelling Ugandan territory. Ugandan civilians were killed and a significant amount of damage to property was incurred, and there were reports of Rwandan troops crossing the border to loot and abduct locals.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|pp=115\u2013116}}\n\nConditions in the Virungas were very harsh for the RPF. At an altitude of almost {{convert|5000|m|ft}},{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} there was no ready availability of food or supplies and, lacking warm clothing, several soldiers froze to death or lost limbs in the [[Alpine climate|high-altitude cold climate]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=80}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} Kagame spent the next two months reorganising the army, without carrying out any military operations.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} [[Alexis Kanyarengwe]], a Hutu colonel who had worked with Habyarimana but had fallen out with him and gone into exile, joined the RPF and was appointed chairman of the organisation.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} Another Hutu, [[Seth Sendashonga]], became the RPF's liaison with Rwandan opposition parties.{{sfn|Des Forges|1999|loc=[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno15-8-03.htm The Rwandan Patriotic Front]}} Most of the other senior recruits at the time were Ugandan-based Tutsi.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} Personnel numbers grew steadily, volunteers coming from the exile communities in Burundi, Zaire and other countries.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=116}} Kagame maintained tight discipline in his army, enforcing a regimented training routine, as well as a large set of rules for soldier conduct.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=83}} Soldiers were expected to pay for goods purchased in the community, refrain from alcohol and drugs, and to establish a good reputation for the RPF amongst the local population.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=83}} The RPF punished personnel who broke these rules, sometimes with beatings, while more serious offences such as murder, rape, and desertion, were punishable by death.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=83}}\n\nThe RPF carried out a major fundraising programme, spearheaded by Financial Commissioner [[Aloisia Inyumba]] in Kampala.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} They received donations from Tutsi exiles around the world,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=82}} as well as from businessmen within Rwanda who had fallen out with the government.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=117}} The sums involved were not enormous but, with tight financial discipline and a leadership willing to lead frugal lives, the RPF was able to grow its operational capability.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=118}} It obtained its weapons and ammunition from a variety of sources, including the open market, taking advantage of a surplus of weaponry at the end of the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=118}} It is likely they also received weaponry from officers in the Ugandan Army; according to G\u00e9rard Prunier, Ugandans who had fought with Kagame in the Bush War remained loyal to him and secretly passed weaponry to the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Museveni likely knew of this but was able to claim ignorance when dealing with the international community.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Museveni later said that \"faced with [a] ''fait accompli'' situation by our Rwandan brothers\", Uganda went \"to help the RPF, materially, so that they are not defeated because that would have been detrimental to the Tutsi people of Rwanda and would not have been good for Uganda's stability\".{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=183}} Journalist Justus Muhanguzi Kampe reported that the taking of military equipment by deserted Tutsi members of the Ugandan Army meant that the national arsenal \"nearly got depleted\"; he suspected that the war \"must have had a tremendous financial impact on the Ugandan government, especially Uganda's military budget\", costing the country \"trillions of shillings\".{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|pp=117, 121}}\n\n=== Attack on Ruhengeri, January 1991 ===\n[[File:Ruhengeri.jpg|thumb|The town of [[Ruhengeri]], with the [[Virunga Mountains]] in the background|alt=Photograph of Ruhengeri, Rwanda, with buildings, a street, and people visible, and mountains in the background, partially in cloud]]\nAfter three months of regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to fight again.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=87}} The target for the first attack was the northern city of [[Ruhengeri]],{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=87}} south of the Virunga mountains.{{sfn|ITMB Publishing}} The city was the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north-west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region as the heartland of the regime.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence and Kagame hoped this would destabilise the government.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}}\n\nDuring the night of 22 January, seven hundred RPF fighters descended from the mountains into hidden locations around the city, assisted by RPF sympathisers living in the area.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} They attacked on the morning of 23 January.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=120}} The Rwandan forces were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} The Rwandan Police and army succeeded in briefly repelling the invasion in areas around their stations, killing large numbers of rebel fighters in the process.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} It is likely the Rwandan Army forces were assisted by French troops, as the French Government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} By noon, the defending forces were defeated and the RPF held the whole city.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} Most of the civilian population fled.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=127}}\n\nOne of the principal RPF targets in Ruhengeri was the prison, which was Rwanda's largest.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} When he learnt of the invasion the warden, {{interlanguage link|Charles Uwihoreye|fr}}, telephoned the government in Kigali to request instructions.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=120}} He spoke to Colonel [[Elie Sagatwa]], one of the ''akazu'', who ordered him to kill every inmate in the prison to avoid escape and defections during the fighting.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} He also wanted to prevent high-profile political prisoners and former insiders from sharing secret information with the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Uwihoreye refused to obey, even after Sagatwa called him and repeated the order, having confirmed it with the president.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} Eventually, the RPF stormed the buildings and the prisoners were liberated.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} Several prisoners were recruited into the RPF, including [[Th\u00e9oneste Lizinde]], a former close ally of President Habyarimana, who had been arrested following a failed coup attempt in 1980.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}}\n\nThe RPF forces held Ruhengeri through the afternoon of 23 January, before withdrawing into the mountains for the night.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} The raid undermined the Rwandan Government's claims that the RPF had been ejected from the country and had been reduced to conducting guerrilla operations from Uganda.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=127}} The government sent troops to the city the following day and a [[state of emergency]] was declared, with strict curfews in Ruhengeri and the surrounding area.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} The RPF raided the city almost every night for several months, fighting with Rwandan army forces, and the country was back at war for the first time since the October invasion.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}}\n\n=== Guerrilla war, 1991\u20131992 ===\nFollowing the action in Ruhengeri the RPF again began to wage guerrilla war.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=135}} The Rwandan Army massed troops across the north of the country, occupying key positions and shelling RPF hideouts in the Virunga mountains, but the mountainous terrain prevented them from launching an all-out assault.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=90}} Paul Kagame's troops attacked the Rwandan Army forces repeatedly and frequently, keen to ensure that the diplomatic and psychological effect of the RPF's resurgence was not lost.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=91}} Kagame employed tactics such as attacking simultaneously in up to ten locations across the north of the country, to prevent his opponents from concentrating their force in any one place.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=91}} This low intensity war continued for many months, both sides launching successful attacks on the other, and neither able to gain the upper hand in the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=91}} The RPF made some territorial gains including capturing the border town of [[Gatuna]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=135}} This was significant as it blocked Rwanda's access to the port of [[Mombasa]] via the [[Northern Corridor]], forcing all trade to go through Tanzania via the longer and costlier [[Central Corridor (Africa)|Central Corridor]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=135}} By late 1991 the RPF controlled 5% of Rwanda, setting up its new headquarters in an abandoned tea factory near [[Mulindi]], Byumba province.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=96}} Many Hutu civilians in areas captured by the RPF fled to government-held areas, creating a large population of [[internally displaced persons]] in the country.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=136}}\n\nThe renewed warfare had two effects in Rwanda. The first was a resurgence of violence against Tutsi still in the country. Hutu activists killed up to 1,000 Tutsi in attacks authorised by local officials, starting with the slaughter of 30\u201360 [[Bagogwe]] Tutsi pastoralists near [[Kinigi]] and then moving south and west to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=136\u2013137}} These attacks continued until June 1991, when the government introduced measures to allow potential victims to move to safer areas such as Kigali.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=136\u2013137}} The ''akazu'' also began a major propaganda campaign, broadcasting and publishing material designed to persuade the Hutu population that the Tutsi were a separate and alien people, non-Christians seeking to re-establish the old Rwandan feudal monarchy with the final goal of enslaving the Hutu.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=98}} This included the [[Hutu Ten Commandments]], a set of \"rules\" published in the ''[[Kangura]]'' magazine, mandating Hutu supremacy in all aspects of Rwandan life.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=92\u201394}} In response the RPF opened its own propaganda radio station, [[Radio Muhabura]], which broadcast from Uganda into Rwanda. This was never hugely popular but gained listenership during 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Des Forges|1999|loc=[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno1-3-10.htm Propaganda and Practice]}}\n\nThe second development was that President Habyarimana announced that he was introducing multi-party politics into the country, following intense pressure from the international community, including his most loyal ally France.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=97}} Habyarimana had originally promised this in mid-1990, and opposition groups had formed in the months since, including the [[Republican Democratic Movement]] (MDR), [[Social Democratic Party (Rwanda)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) and the [[Liberal Party (Rwanda)|Liberal Party]] (PL),{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=123\u2013124}} but the one-party state law had remained in place.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=127}} In mid-1991 Habyarimana officially allowed multi-party politics to begin, a change that saw a plethora of new parties come into existence.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=127}}{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=66\u221267}} Many had manifestos which favoured full democracy and rapprochement with the RPF,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=97}} but these were quite ineffective and had no political influence.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=127}} The older opposition groups registered themselves as official parties and the country was notionally moving towards a multi-party inclusive cabinet with proper representation, but progress was continually hampered by the regime. The last opposition party to form was the [[Coalition for the Defence of the Republic]] (CDR),{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=69}} which was more hardline Hutu than Habyarimana's own party and had close links to the ''akazu''.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=98}}\n\nProgress remained slow in 1991 and 1992. A cabinet set up in October 1991 contained almost no opposition, and the administrative hierarchy across the country only recognised the authority of Habyarimana's National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=134}} Another one-party cabinet was announced in January 1992 which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, forcing Habyarimana to make real concessions.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=103}} He announced his intention to negotiate with the RPF,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=103}} and formed a multi-party cabinet in April. This was still dominated by Habyarimana's party, but with opposition figures in some key positions.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=145}} The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and negotiated a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began peace negotiations in the Tanzanian city of [[Arusha]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=150}}\n\n===Peace process, 1992\u20131993===\nThe peace process was complicated by the fact that four distinct groups were involved, each with its own agenda. The Hutu hardliners, centred around the family of Agathe Habyarimana, were represented by the CDR as well as extremists within the president's own MRND party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=161}} The second group was the official opposition, which excluded the CDR. They had much more democratic and conciliatory aims but were also deeply suspicious of the RPF, whom they saw as trying to upset the \"democratic\" policy of Hutu rule established in the 1959 revolution.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=151}} The third group was the RPF. Paul Kagame engaged with the peace process against the advice of some of his senior officers, in the knowledge that many of those on the other side of the table were hardliners who were not sincerely interested in negotiations. He feared that shunning the opportunity for peace would weaken the RPF politically and lose them international goodwill.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=97}} Finally there was the group representing President Habyarimana himself, who sought primarily to hold on to his power in whatever form he could. This meant publicly striving for a middle ground compromise solution, but privately obstructing the process and trying to delay change to the status quo for as long as possible.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=161}} Habyarimana recognised the danger posed to him by the radical Hutu faction and attempted in mid-1992 to remove them from senior army positions. This effort was only partially successful; ''akazu'' affiliates [[Augustin Ndindiliyimana]] and [[Th\u00e9oneste Bagosora]] remained in influential posts, providing them with a link to power.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=167}}\n\nThe delegates at the negotiations in Arusha made some progress in the latter half of 1992, despite wrangling between Habyarimana and hardline members of his party that compromised the government officials' negotiating power.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=162}} In August the parties agreed a \"pluralistic transitional government\", which would include the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=162}} The CDR and hardline faction of the MRND reacted violently to this. Feeling sidelined by the developing Arusha process,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=163}} they began killing Tutsi civilians in the [[Kibuye, Rwanda|Kibuye]] area; 85 were killed, and 500 homes burnt.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=162}} Historian G\u00e9rard Prunier names late 1992 as the time when the idea of a genocidal \"final solution\" to kill every Tutsi in Rwanda was first mooted.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=169}} Hardliners were busy setting up parallel institutions within the official organs of state, including the army, from which they hoped to effect a move away from the more conciliatory tone adopted by Habyarimana and the moderate opposition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=169}} Their goal was to take over from Habyarimana's government as the perceived source of power in the country amongst the Hutu masses, to maintain the line that the RPF and Tutsi more generally were a threat to Hutu freedoms, and to find a way to thwart any agreement negotiated in Arusha.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=170}}\n\nThe situation deteriorated in early 1993 when the teams in Arusha signed a full power-sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF and other major opposition parties, but excluding the CDR.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}}{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=140\u2212141}} This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until free and fair elections could be held.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}} The agreement reflected the balance of power at the time; Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition, and the RPF all accepted it, but the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}} MRND national secretary [[Mathieu Ngirumpatse]] announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}} The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger killing spree than those that had previously occurred.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The violence engulfed the whole north-west of Rwanda and lasted for six days; many houses were burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}}{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}}\n\n===RPF offensive, February 1993===\n[[File:RwandaTerritoryAfterFeb1993.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The partition of Rwanda following the RPF offensive in February 1993.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=xx}} For the first time, the Rwandan Government acknowledged that it had lost part of the country.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}}|alt=Map showing the partition of Rwanda between government, RPF, and demilitarised zones.]]\nPaul Kagame responded by pulling out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six-month cease-fire.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}}{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=80}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}} The RPF cited the CDR and MRND-hardliner violence as its reason for this, but according to foreign policy scholar [[Bruce D.

By demonstrating its military power in the field, through a successful offensive against the Rwandan Government forces, the RPF was able to secure an increased percentage of troops in the agreement.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}}\n\nThe RPF began its offensive on 8 February, fighting southwards from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} In contrast to the October 1990 and 1991\u20131992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met by weak resistance from the Rwandan Army forces.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The likely reason was a significant deterioration in morale and military experience within the government forces.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The impact of the long-running war on the economy, and a heavy devaluation of the [[Rwandan franc]],{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=159}} had left the government struggling to pay its soldiers regularly.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one-year.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready,{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}}\n\nThe RPF advance continued unchecked in February, its forces moving steadily south and gaining territory without opposition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} They took Ruhengeri on the first day of fighting,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} and later the city of [[Byumba]]. Local Hutu civilians fled ''en masse'' from the areas the RPF were taking, most of them ending up in refugee camps on the outskirts of Kigali.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=81}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} The civilian cost of the offensive is unclear; according to Andr\u00e9 Guichaoua several thousand were killed,{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=81}} while Prunier labelled the RPF killing as \"small-scale\".{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} This violence alienated the rebels from their potential allies in the democratic Rwandan opposition parties.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=176}}\n\nWhen it became clear that the Rwandan Army was losing ground to the RPF, Habyarimana requested urgent assistance from France.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}} Fearing that the RPF could soon be in a position to seize Kigali, the French immediately dispatched 150 troops to Rwanda,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}} along with arms and ammunition, to bolster the Rwandan Army forces.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=176}} A further 250 French soldiers were sent on 20 February.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}} The arrival of French troops in Kigali significantly changed the military situation on the ground. The RPF now found themselves under attack, French shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=105}}\n\nBy 20 February the RPF had advanced to within {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} of the capital, [[Kigali]],{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=177}} and many observers believed an assault on the city was imminent.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} The assault did not take place, and the RPF instead declared a cease-fire.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=177}} Whether or not the RPF intended to advance on the capital is unknown. Kagame later stated that his aim at this point was to inflict as much damage as possible on Rwandan Army forces, capture their weapons, and gain ground slowly, but not to attack the capital or seek to end the war with an outright RPF victory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}} Kagame told journalist and author [[Stephen Kinzer]] that such a victory would have ended international goodwill towards the RPF and led to charges that the war had simply been a bid to replace the Hutu state with a Tutsi one.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}} The increased presence of French troops and the fierce loyalty of the Hutu population to the government meant that an invasion of Kigali would not have been achieved with the same ease that the RPF had conquered the north. Fighting for the capital would have been a much more difficult and dangerous operation.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=178}} Several of Kagame's senior officers urged him to go for outright victory but he overruled them.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=105}} By the end of the February war over one million civilians, mostly Hutu, had left their homes in the country's largest exodus to date.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=105}}\n\n===Arusha Accords and rise of Hutu Power, 1993\u20131994===\n{{main|Arusha Accords (Rwanda)}}\n[[File:AICC Arusha.jpg|thumb|The [[Arusha International Conference Centre]], venue for peace talks to end the war|alt=Photograph showing the front entrance of the Arusha International Conference Centre]]\nThe RPF cease-fire was followed by two days of negotiations in the Ugandan capital [[Kampala]], attended by RPF leader Paul Kagame, and involving President Museveni and representatives of European nations.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} The Europeans insisted that RPF forces withdraw to the zone they had held before the February offensive. Kagame responded that he would only agree to this if the Rwandan army were forbidden from re-entering the newly conquered territory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} Following a threat by Kagame to resume fighting and potentially take even more territory, the two sides reached a compromise deal. This entailed the RPF withdrawing to its pre-February territory, but also mandated the setting up of a demilitarised zone between the RPF area and the rest of the country.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} The deal was significant because it marked a formal concession by Habyarimana's regime of the northern zone to the rebels, recognising the RPF hold on that territory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} There were many within the RPF senior command who felt that Kagame had ceded too much, because the deal meant not only withdrawal to the pre-February boundaries, but also a promise not to encroach on the demilitarised zone. This therefore ended RPF ambitions of capturing more territory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} Kagame used the authority he had accumulated through his successful leadership of the RPF to override these concerns, and the parties returned once more to the negotiating table in Arusha.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=107}}\n\nDespite the agreement and ongoing negotiations President Habyarimana, supported by the French Government,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=178}} spent the subsequent months forging a \"common front\" against the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=179}} This included members of his own party and the CDR and also factions from each of the other opposition parties in the power-sharing coalition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=179}} At the same time other members of the same parties issued a statement, in conjunction with the RPF, in which they condemned French involvement in the country and called for the Arusha process to be respected in full.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=179}} The hardline factions within the parties became known as [[Hutu Power]], a movement which transcended party politics.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=188}} Apart from the CDR there was no party that was exclusively part of the Power movement.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=181\u2013182}} Instead almost every party was split into \"moderate\" and \"Power\" wings, with members of both camps claiming to represent the legitimate leadership of that party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=181\u2013182}} Even the ruling party contained a Power wing, consisting of those who opposed Habyarimana's intention to sign a peace deal.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=182}} Several radical youth militia groups emerged, attached to the Power wings of the parties; these included the ''[[Interahamwe]]'', which was attached to the ruling party,{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=129}} and the CDR's ''[[Impuzamugambi]]''.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=165}} The youth militia began actively carrying out massacres across the country.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=25}} The army trained the militias, sometimes in conjunction with the French, who were unaware of the fact that the training they provided was being used to perpetrate the mass killings.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=165}}\n\nBy June President Habyarimana had come to view Hutu Power, rather than the mainstream opposition, as the biggest threat to his leadership.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=186}} This led him to change tactics and engage fully with the Arusha peace process, giving it the impetus it needed to draw to a completion.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=186}} According to Prunier this support was more symbolic than genuine. Habyarimana believed that he could maintain power more easily through a combination of limited concessions to the opposition and RPF than he could if Hutu Power were allowed to disrupt the peace process.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=186}} The negotiation of troop numbers was protracted and difficult; twice the talks almost collapsed.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} The Rwandan Government wanted to allocate only 15% of the officer corps to the RPF, reflecting the proportion of Tutsi in the country, while the RPF was arguing for a 50/50 split.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} The RPF were in a superior position following their successful February campaign and were backed in their demands by Tanzania, which was chairing the talks.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} The government eventually agreed to their demands.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=193}} As well as 50% of the officer corps, the RPF was allocated up to 40% of the non-command troops.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=193}} The deal also mandated large-scale demobilisation; of the 35,000 Rwandan Army and 20,000 RPF soldiers at the time of the accords, only 19,000 would be drafted into the new national army.{{sfn|IPEP|2000|pp=49\u201350}} With all details agreed the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] were finally signed on 4 August 1993 at a formal ceremony attended by President Habyarimana as well as heads of state from neighbouring countries.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=191}}\n\nAn uneasy peace was once again entered into, which would last until 7 April of the following year. The agreement called for a United Nations [[peacekeeping]] force; this was titled the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR), and was in place in Rwanda by October 1993{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=98}} under the command of Canadian General [[Rom\u00e9o Dallaire]].{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=42}} Another stipulation of the agreement was that the RPF would station diplomats in Kigali at the ''Conseil national de d\u00e9veloppement'' (CND), now known as the [[Chamber of Deputies (Rwanda)|Chamber of Deputies]], Rwanda's Parliament building.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=130}} These men were protected by 600\u20131,000 RPF soldiers, who arrived in Kigali through UNAMIR's [[Operation Clean Corridor]] in December 1993.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=130}} Meanwhile, the Hutu Power wings of the various parties were beginning plans for a genocide.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} The President of Burundi, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], who had been elected in June as the country's first ever Hutu president, [[1993 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|was assassinated]] by extremist Tutsi army officers in October 1993.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=199}} The assassination reinforced the notion among Hutus that the Tutsi were their enemy and could not be trusted.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} The CDR and the Power wings of the other parties realised they could use this situation to their advantage.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} The idea of a \"final solution\", which had first been suggested in 1992 but had remained a fringe viewpoint, was now top of their agenda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} An informant from the ''Interahamwe'' told UNAMIR officials that a group of Hutu extremists were planning on disrupting the peace process and killing Tutsis in Kigali.<ref>{{cite AV media| people = Greg Barker (Director)| title = Ghosts of Rwanda| medium = Television production| publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service]]| date = 1 April 2004| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ghosts/}}</ref>\n\n===Military operations during the 1994 genocide===\n{{main|Rwandan genocide}}\n[[File:RPF advance Rwandan Genocide cropped 1994.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map showing the advance of the RPF during the Rwandan genocide of 1994.{{sfn|Kuperman|2001|p=41}}|alt=Map showing the advance of the RPF during the Rwandan genocide of 1994]]\nThe cease-fire ended abruptly on 6 April 1994 when President Habyarimana's plane [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|was shot down]] near [[Kigali Airport]], killing both Habyarimana and the new [[List of Presidents of Burundi|President of Burundi]], [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]].{{sfn|National Assembly of France|1998}}{{sfn|BBC News (I)|2010}} The pair were returning home from a regional summit in [[Dar es Salaam]] at which the leaders of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, had urged Habyarimana to stop delaying the implementation of the Arusha accords.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=211}} The attackers remain unknown.

Many buildings were uninhabitable and the former regime had taken all currency and moveable assets when they fled the country.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=181}} Human resources were severely depleted, with over {{Percentage|40|100|0}} of the population having fled or been killed.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=181}} Many of the remainder were traumatised: most had lost relatives, witnessed killings, or participated in the genocide.{{sfn|United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|2011}} The long-term effects of [[Rape during the Rwandan genocide|war rape]] included social isolation, [[sexually transmitted diseases]] and unwanted pregnancies and babies, some women resorting to [[self-induced abortion]]s.{{sfn|de Brouwer|2005|p=14}} The army, led by Paul Kagame, maintained law and order while the government began the work of rebuilding the country's institutions and infrastructure.{{sfn|Bonner|1994}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=187}}\n\n[[Non-governmental organisation]]s began to move back into the country but the international community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime. Most [[Aid|international aid]] was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=327\u2013328}} Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi-dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions between Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.{{sfn|Bonner|1994}}\n\nDuring the genocide and in the months following the RPF victory, RPF soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting the genocide.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=189}} Many of these soldiers were recent Tutsi recruits from within Rwanda, who had lost family or friends and sought revenge.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=189}} The scale, scope, and source of ultimate responsibility of these killings is disputed. [[Human Rights Watch]], as well as scholars such as Prunier, allege that the death toll might be as high as 100,000,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=360}} and that Kagame and the RPF elite either tolerated or organised the killings.{{sfn|Des Forges|1999|loc=[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno15-8-03.htm The Rwandan Patriotic Front]}} In an interview with Stephen Kinzer, Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=191}} The killings gained international attention after the 1995 [[Kibeho massacre]], in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in [[Butare Province]].{{sfn|Lorch|1995}} Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4,000 people were killed;{{sfn|Australian War Memorial}} the Rwandan Government claimed that the death toll was 338.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=42}}\n\nPaul Kagame took over the presidency from Pasteur Bizimungu in 2000 and began a large-scale national development drive, launching [[Vision 2020 (Rwanda)|a programme]] to develop Rwanda as a [[middle income country]] by 2020.{{sfn|BBC News (III)|2000}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=226\u2013227}} The country began developing strongly on key indicators, including the [[human development index]], health care, and education. Annual growth between 2004 and 2010 averaged {{percentage|8|100}} per year,{{sfn|Murdock|2010}} the poverty rate reduced from 57% to 45% between 2006 and 2011,{{sfn|National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda|2012}} and [[life expectancy]] rose from 46.6 years in 2000{{sfn|UNDP|2013|p=2}} to 64.3 years in 2018.{{sfn|CIA (I)}} A period of reconciliation began as well as the establishment of courts for trying genocide suspects. These included the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) and ''[[Gacaca]]'', a traditional village court system reintroduced to handle the large caseloads involved.{{sfn|Bowcott|2014}}\n\n===Refugee crisis, insurgency, and Congo wars===\n{{main|Great Lakes refugee crisis|First Congo War|Second Congo War}}\n[[File:Rwandan refugee camp in east Zaire.jpg|thumb|[[Refugee camp]] in [[Zaire]], 1994|alt=View of refugee camp on foggy day, showing tents of various colours and the refugees]]\nFollowing the RPF victory, approximately two million Hutu fled to refugee camps in neighbouring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan genocide.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=312}} The camps were crowded and squalid and tens of thousands of refugees died in disease epidemics, including [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]].{{sfn|UNHCR|2000}}{{sfn|Siddique|1994}} They were set up by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=313\u2013314}} who began to rearm in a bid to return to power in Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=381\u2013382}}{{sfn|Pomfret|1997}}\n\nBy late 1996, Hutu militants from the camps were launching regular cross-border incursions and the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched a counter-offensive.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=382}} Rwanda provided troops and military training{{sfn|Pomfret|1997}} to the [[Banyamulenge]], a Tutsi group in the Zairian [[South Kivu]] province,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=384\u2013385}} helping them to defeat Zairian security forces.

hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee;{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=118}} many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=122\u2013123}} The refugees fleeing further into Zaire were relentlessly pursued by the RPA under the cover of the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of

cross-border insurgency campaign,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=209}} supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north-western provinces.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=216}} By 1999 a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the [[Rwandan Defence Forces|national army]] succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.{{sfn|Brittain|1999}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=215\u2013218}}\n\nAs well as dismantling the refugee camps, Kagame began planning a war to remove Mobutu.{{sfn|Pomfret|1997}} Mobutu had supported the ''genocidaires'' based in the camps and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire.{{sfn|Byman|Chalk|Hoffman|Rosenau|2001|p=18}} The Rwandan and Ugandan governments supported an alliance of four rebel groups headed by [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]], which began waging the [[First Congo War]].{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=113\u2013116}} The rebels quickly took control of North and South Kivu provinces and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=128\u2013133}} They controlled the whole country by May 1997.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=136}} Mobutu fled into exile and the country was renamed [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC).{{sfn|BBC News (II)}} Rwanda fell out with the new Congolese regime in 1998 and Kagame supported a fresh rebellion, leading to the [[Second Congo War]].{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=182\u2013183}} This lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and severe damage.{{sfn|BBC News (II)}} A 2010 United Nations report accused the [[Rwandan Patriotic Army]] of wide-scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity during the two

rebel [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) from 1 October 1990 to 18 July 1994. The war, which lasted from 1990 to 1994, arose from the long-running dispute between the [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] groups within the Rwandan population. A [[Rwandan Revolution|1959\u20131962 revolution]] had replaced the [[Kingdom of Rwanda|Tutsi monarchy]] with a Hutu-led republic, forcing more than 336,000 Tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. A group of these refugees in [[Uganda]] founded the RPF which, under the leadership of [[Fred Rwigyema]] and [[Paul Kagame]], became a battle-ready army by the late 1980s.\n\nThe war began on 1 October 1990 when the RPF invaded north-eastern Rwanda, advancing {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} into the country. They suffered a major setback when Rwigyema was killed in action on the second day. The Rwandan Army, assisted by troops from France, gained the upper hand and the RPF were largely defeated by the end of October. Kagame, who had been in the United States during the invasion, returned to take command. He withdrew troops to the [[Virunga Mountains]] for several months before attacking again. The RPF began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]], which continued until mid-1992 with neither side able to gain the upper hand. A series of protests forced Rwandan President [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] to begin peace negotiations with the RPF and domestic opposition parties. Despite disruption and killings by [[Hutu Power]], a group of extremists opposed to any deal, and a fresh RPF offensive in early 1993, the negotiations were successfully concluded with the signing of the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] in August 1993.\n\nAn uneasy peace followed, during which the terms of the accords were gradually implemented. RPF troops were deployed to a compound in Kigali and the peace-keeping [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR) was sent to the country. But the Hutu Power movement was steadily gaining influence and planned a \"final solution\" to exterminate the Tutsi. This plan was put into action following the [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|assassination of President Habyarimana]] on 6 April 1994. Over the course of about 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed in the [[Rwandan genocide]]. The RPF quickly resumed the civil war. They captured territory steadily, encircling cities and cutting off supply routes. By mid-June they had surrounded the capital, [[Kigali]], and on 4 July they seized it. The war ended later that month when the RPF captured the last territory held by the interim government, forcing the government and ''genocidaires'' into [[Zaire]].\n\nThe victorious RPF assumed control of the country, with Paul Kagame as de facto leader. Kagame served as [[Vice President of Rwanda|vice president]] from 1994 and as president from 2000. The RPF began a programme of rebuilding the infrastructure and economy of the country, bringing genocide perpetrators to trial, and promoting reconciliation between Hutu and Tutsi. In 1996 the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched an offensive against refugee camps in Zaire, home to exiled leaders of the former regime and millions of Hutu refugees. This action started the [[First Congo War]], which removed long-time dictator President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] from power. As of 2019, Kagame and the RPF remain the dominant political force in Rwanda.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Pre-independence Rwanda and origins of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa===\n{{main|Origins of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa}}\n[[File:Rwanda Nyanza Mwami Palace.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of the [[King of Rwanda]]'s palace at [[Nyanza, Rwanda|Nyanza]]|alt=Photograph of King's palace in Nyanza, Rwanda depicting main entrance, front and conical roof]]\nThe earliest inhabitants of what is now [[Rwanda]] were the [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] hunter-gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=44}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups migrated into the region and began to clear forest land for agriculture.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=58}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their land and moved to the slopes of mountains.{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} Historians have several theories regarding the Bantu migrations. One theory is that the first settlers were [[Hutu]], and the [[Tutsi]] migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly originating from the [[Horn of Africa]].{{sfn|Pottier|2002|p=12}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=16}} An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=58}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} Under this theory the Hutu and Tutsi are a later class, rather than a racial,  distinction.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=69}}{{sfn|Shyaka|2004|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe population coalesced, first into [[Clans of Rwanda|clans]] (''ubwoko''){{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=88\u201389}} and by 1700 into around eight kingdoms.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=482}} The [[Kingdom of Rwanda]], ruled by the Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became dominant from the mid-eighteenth century,{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} expanding through conquest and assimilation.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=38}} It achieved its greatest extent under the reign of [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli Rwabugiri]] in 1853\u20131895. Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north, and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} {{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} These included ''uburetwa'', a system of forced labour which Hutu had to perform to regain access to land seized from them,{{sfn|Pottier|2002|p=13}} and ''[[ubuhake]]'', under which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=13\u201314}} Rwanda and neighbouring [[Burundi]] were assigned to Germany by the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin Conference]] of 1884,{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=218}} and Germany established a presence in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the King.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=24}} German policy was to rule through the Rwandan monarchy, enabling colonisation with fewer European troops.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=25}} The colonists favoured the Tutsi over the Hutu when assigning administrative roles, believing them to be migrants from Ethiopia and racially superior.{{sfn|Jones|2001|p=17}} The Rwandan King welcomed the Germans, and used their military strength to reinforce his rule and expand the kingdom.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=217\u2013218}} [[East African Campaign (World War I)|Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi]] during World War I,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=25\u201326}} and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=26}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=260}} The Belgian administration, in conjunction with Catholic clerics, modernised the local economy.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=32\u201335}} They also increased taxes and imposed forced labour on the population.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=35}} Tutsi supremacy remained, reinforced by Belgium's enthusiastic support of the monarchy, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=38\u201339}} In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards classifying each individual as Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. It had previously been possible for wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, but the identity cards prevented further movement between the groups.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n===Revolution, exile of Tutsi, and the Hutu republic===\n{{main|Rwandan Revolution}}\nAfter 1945 a Hutu counter-elite developed,{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=108}} demanding the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=45\u201346}} The Tutsi leadership responded by trying to negotiate a speedy independence on their terms but found the Belgians no longer supported them.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=43}}{{sfn|Kroslak|2007|p=24}} There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=43\u201344}} with prominent conservative figures in the early Rwandan church replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these a greater proportion were [[Flemish people|Flemish]] rather than [[Walloons|Walloon]] Belgians and sympathised with the plight of the Hutu.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=113}} In November 1959 the Hutu began a series of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes, following false rumours of the death of a Hutu sub-chief in an assault by Tutsi activists.{{sfn|Carney|2013|pp=124\u2013125}} Violence quickly spread across the whole country, beginning the [[Rwandan Revolution]].{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=125}} The King and Tutsi politicians launched a counter-attack{{sfn|Newbury|1988|p=196}} in an attempt to seize power and ostracise the Hutu and Belgians,{{sfn|Newbury|1988|pp=195\u2013196}} but were thwarted by Belgian Colonel [[Guy Logiest]], who was brought in by the colonial Governor.{{sfn|Newbury|1988|p=196}} Logiest re-established law and order and began a programme of overt promotion and protection of the Hutu elite.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=127}} He replaced many Tutsi chiefs with Hutu and effectively forced [[Kigeli V of Rwanda|King Kigeli V]] into exile.{{sfn|Sabar|2013}}\n\n[[File:Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana (1980).jpg|thumb| Hutu army officer [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] (pictured) became President of Rwanda after [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a 1973 coup]].]]\nLogiest and Hutu leader [[Gr\u00e9goire Kayibanda]] declared the country an autonomous republic in 1961 and it became independent in 1962.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=53\u201354}} More than 336,000 Tutsi left Rwanda by 1964 to escape the Hutu purges,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=62}}{{sfn|Mayersen|2010|p=21}} mostly to the neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, [[Tanzania]] and Zaire.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|pp=160\u2013161}} Many of the Tutsi exiles lived as refugees in their host countries,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=63\u201364}} and sought to return to Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=55}} Some supported the new Rwandan Government, but others formed armed groups and launched attacks on Rwanda,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=55}} the largest of which advanced close to Kigali in 1963.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=56}} These groups were known in [[Kinyarwanda]] as the ''inyenzi'' (cockroaches).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=54}} Historians do not know the origin of this term \u2013 it is possible the rebels coined it themselves, the name reflecting the fact that they generally attacked at night.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=34}} The ''inyenzi'' label resurfaced in the 1990s as a highly derogatory term for the Tutsi, used by Hutu hardliners to dehumanise them.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=34}} The ''inyenzi'' attacks of the 1960s were poorly equipped and organised and the government defeated them. The last significant attack was made in desperation from Burundi in December 1963 but failed due to bad planning and lack of equipment. The government responded to this attack with the slaughter of an estimated 10,000 Tutsi within Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=56}}\n\nKayibanda presided over a Hutu republic for the next decade, imposing an autocratic rule similar to the pre-revolution feudal monarchy.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=57}} In 1973 Hutu army officer [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] toppled Kayibanda in [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=74\u201376}} He founded the [[National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development]] (MRND) party in 1975,{{sfn|Twagilimana|2007|p=117}} and promulgated a new constitution following a [[Rwandan constitutional referendum, 1978|1978 referendum]], making the country a [[one-party state]] in which every citizen had to belong to the MRND.{{sfn|Twagilimana|2007|p=116}} Anti-Tutsi discrimination continued under Habyarimana but the country enjoyed greater economic prosperity and reduced anti-Tutsi violence.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=74\u201376}} A coffee price collapse in the late 1980s caused a loss of income for Rwanda's wealthy elite, precipitating a political fight for power and access to [[foreign aid]] receipts.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=84}} The family of first lady [[Agathe Habyarimana]], known as the ''[[akazu]]'', were the principal winners in this fight.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=85}} The family had a more respected lineage than that of the President, having ruled one of the independent states near [[Gisenyi]] in the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=86}} Habyarimana therefore relied on them in controlling the population of the north-west.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=86}} The ''akazu'' exploited this to their advantage, and Habyarimana was increasingly unable to rule without them.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=86}} The economic situation forced Habyarimana to greatly reduce the [[national budget]], which led to civil unrest.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=87\u201389}} On the advice of French president [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], Habyarimana declared a commitment to [[Multi-party system|multi-party politics]] but took no action to bring this about.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=90}} Student protests followed and by late 1990 the country was in crisis.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=90}}\n\n=== Formation of the RPF and preparation for war ===\nThe organisation which became the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) was founded in 1979 in Uganda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=67}} It was initially known as the Rwandan Refugees Welfare Association and then from 1980 as the Rwandan Alliance for National Unity (RANU).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=67}} It formed in response to persecution and discrimination against the Tutsi refugees by the regime of Ugandan President [[Milton Obote]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=67}} Obote accused the Rwandans of collaboration with his predecessor, [[Idi Amin]], including occupying the homes and stealing the cattle of Ugandans who had fled from Amin.{{sfn|Dash|1983}} Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees [[Fred Rwigyema]] and [[Paul Kagame]] had joined [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s rebel [[Front for National Salvation]] (FRONASA).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=68}} Museveni [[Uganda\u2013Tanzania War|fought alongside Obote]] to defeat Amin in 1979 but withdrew from the government following Obote's disputed victory in the [[Ugandan general election, 1980|1980 general election]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}} With Rwigyema and Kagame he formed a new rebel army, the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA).{{sfn|Associated Press (I)|1981}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}} The NRA's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in what became known as the [[Ugandan Bush War]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}}{{sfn|Nganda|2009}} President Obote remained hostile to the Rwandan refugees throughout his presidency and RANU was forced into exile in 1981, relocating to [[Nairobi]] in Kenya.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=63}} In 1982, with the authority of Obote,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=69}} local district councils in the [[Ankole]] region issued notices requiring refugees to be evicted from their homes and settled in camps.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=19}} These evictions were violently implemented by Ankole youth militia.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=69}} Many displaced Rwandans attempted to cross the border to Rwanda, but the Habyarimana regime confined them to isolated camps and closed the border to prevent further migration.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=22}} Faced with the threat of statelessness,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=22}} many more Tutsi refugees in Uganda chose to join Museveni's NRA.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=24}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=70}}\n[[File:ReaganMuseveni.jpg|thumb|Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] meeting with [[Ronald Reagan]] at the [[White House]] in October 1987]]\nIn 1986 the NRA [[Battle of Kampala|captured Kampala]] with a force of 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=47}} After Museveni was inaugurated as president he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Simpson (I)|2000}} The experience of the Bush War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, with the goal of allowing the refugees to return home.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=51\u201352}} As well as fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=51\u201352}} With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala.{{sfn|Wells|Fellows|2016|p=29}} At its 1987 convention it renamed itself to the Rwandan Patriotic Front and it too committed to returning the refugees to Rwanda by any means possible.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=72\u201373}} In 1988 a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing [[Peter Bayingana]] as RPF president.{{sfn|Bamurangirwa|2013|p=80}} Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, Kagame assuming the vice presidency.{{sfn|Bamurangirwa|2013|p=80}} Bayingana remained as the other vice president but resented the loss of the leadership.{{sfn|Bamurangirwa|2013|p=80}} Bayingana and his supporters attempted to start the war with an invasion in late 1989 without the support of Rwigyema,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=34}} but this was quickly repelled by the Rwandan Army.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=31}}\n\nRwandan President Habyarimana was aware of the increasing number of Tutsi exiles in the Ugandan Army and made representations to President Museveni on the matter.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=53}} At the same time many native Ugandans and [[Baganda]] officers in the NRA began criticising Museveni over his appointment of Rwandan refugees to senior positions.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=33}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=175}} He therefore demoted Kagame and Rwigyema in 1989.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=53}} They remained de facto senior officers but the change in official status, and the possibility that they might lose access to the resources of the Ugandan military,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=34}} caused them to accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=53\u201354}} In 1990 a dispute in south-western Uganda between Ugandan ranch owners and squatters on their land, many of whom were Rwandans,{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=176}} led to a wider debate on indigeneity and eventually to the explicit labeling of all Rwandan refugees as non-citizens.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=182}} Realising the precariousness of their own positions, the opportunity afforded by both the renewed drive of refugees to leave Uganda, and the instability on the Rwandan domestic scene, Rwigyema and Kagame decided in mid-1990 to effect their invasion plans immediately.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=57}} It is likely that President Museveni knew of the planned invasion but did not explicitly support it.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=97\u201398}} In mid-1990 Museveni ordered Rwigyema to attend an officer training course at the [[Command and General Staff College]] in [[Fort Leavenworth]] in the United States, and was also planning overseas deployments for other senior Rwandans in the army.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=61}} This may have been a tactic to reduce the threat of an RPF invasion of Rwanda.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=61}} After two days of discussion Rwigyema persuaded Museveni that following years of army duty he needed a break and was allowed to remain in Uganda.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=61\u201362}} Museveni then ordered Kagame to attend instead. The RPF leadership allowed him to go, to avoid suspicion, even though it meant his missing the beginning of the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=62}}\n\n== Course of the war ==\n\n=== 1990 invasion and death of Rwigyema ===\nOn 1 October 1990 fifty RPF rebels deserted their Ugandan Army posts and crossed the border from Uganda into Rwanda, killing a Rwandan customs guard at the Kagitumba border post and forcing others to flee.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=93}} They were followed by hundreds more rebels, dressed in the uniforms of the [[Uganda People's Defence Force|Ugandan national army]] and carrying stolen Ugandan weaponry, including [[machine gun]]s, [[autocannon]]s, [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]], and Soviet [[BM-21 Grad|BM-21 multiple rocket launchers]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=93}} According to RPF estimates, around 2,500 of the Ugandan Army's 4,000 Rwandan soldiers took part in the invasion,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=93}} accompanied by 800 civilians, including medical staff and messengers.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=65}} Both President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Habyarimana of Rwanda were in [[New York City]] attending the United Nations [[World Summit for Children]].{{sfn|Biles|1990}} In the first few days of fighting, the RPF advanced {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} south to [[Gabiro]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=94}} Their [[Rwandan Armed Forces]] opponents, fighting for Habyarimana's government, were numerically superior, with 5,200 soldiers, and possessed armoured cars and helicopters supplied by France, but the RPF benefited from the element of surprise.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=94}} The Ugandan government set up roadblocks across the west of Uganda, to prevent further desertions and to block the rebels from returning to Uganda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=94}}\n\nOn 2 October the RPF leader Fred Rwigyema was shot in the head and killed. The exact circumstances of Rwigyema's death are disputed; the official line of Kagame's government,{{sfn|Government of Rwanda|2009}} and the version mentioned by historian [[G\u00e9rard Prunier]] in his 1995 book on the subject, was that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=95\u201396}} In his 2009 book ''Africa's World War'', Prunier states that Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=13\u201314}} According to this account, Rwigyema was conscious of the need to move slowly and attempt to win over the Hutu in Rwanda before assaulting Kigali, whereas Bayingana and fellow subcommander [[Chris Bunyenyezi]] wished to strike hard and fast, to achieve power as soon as possible. The argument boiled over, causing Bayingana to shoot Rwigyema dead.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=13\u201314}} Another senior RPF officer, [[Stephen Nduguta]], witnessed this shooting and informed President Museveni; Museveni sent his brother [[Salim Saleh]] to investigate, and Saleh ordered Bayingana's and Bunyenyezi's arrests and eventual executions.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=14}}\n\nWhen news of the RPF offensive broke, Habyarimana requested assistance from France in fighting the invasion.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} The French president's son, [[Jean-Christophe Mitterrand]], was head of the government's Africa Cell and promised to send troops.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} On the night of 4 October, gunfire was heard in Kigali in a mysterious attack, which was attributed to RPF commandos. The attack was most likely staged by the Rwandan authorities, seeking to convince the French that the regime was in imminent danger.{{refn|group=note|Many sources report that the attack was staged:{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=102}}{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} Andr\u00e9 Guichaoua also finds that the most convincing explanation, but writes that it remains open to debate.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=34}}}} As a result, 600 French soldiers arrived in Rwanda the following day, twice as many as initially pledged.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} The French operation was code-named [[Op\u00e9ration Noro\u00eet|Noro\u00eet]] and its official purpose was to protect French nationals.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|p=27}} In reality the mission was to support Habyarimana's regime and the French parachute companies immediately set up positions blocking the RPF advance to the capital and [[Kigali International Airport]].{{sfn|Melvern|2000|p=14}} Belgium and Zaire also sent troops to Kigali in early October.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=101}} The Belgian troops were deployed primarily to defend the country's citizens living in Rwanda but after a few days it became clear that they were not in danger. Instead, the deployment created a political controversy as news reached Brussels of arbitrary arrests and massacres by the Habyarimana regime and its failure to deal with the underlying causes of the war.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=107}} Faced with a growing domestic dispute over the issue, and no with no obvious prospect of achieving peace, the Belgian government withdrew its troops by the beginning of November.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=107\u2013108}} Belgium provided no further military support to the Habyarimana government.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=88}} Zairian President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s contribution was to send several hundred troops of the elite [[Special Presidential Division]] (DSP).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=101}} Unlike the French, the Zairian troops went straight to the front line and began fighting the RPF,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=101}} but their discipline was poor.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=109}} The Zairian soldiers raped Rwandan civilians in the north of the country and looted their homes,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=109}} prompting Habyarimana to expel them back to Zaire within a week of their arrival.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=78}} With French assistance, and benefiting from the loss of RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the Rwandan Army enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF and pushed the rebels all the way back to the Ugandan border.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=96}} Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda and others went into hiding in the [[Akagera National Park]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=96}} Habyarimana accused the Ugandan Government of supplying the RPF, establishing a \"rear command\" for the group in Kampala, and \"flagging off\" the invasion.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=116}} The Rwandan Government announced on 30 October that the war was over.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=96}}\n\nThe Rwandan Government used the attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for the arbitrary arrest of more than 8,000 mostly Tutsi political opponents.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=34}} Tutsi were increasingly viewed with suspicion; [[Radio Rwanda]] aired incitement to ethnic hatred and a pogrom was organised on 11 October in a commune in [[Gisenyi Province]], killing 383 Tutsi.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=16}} It was the first time in nearly twenty years that massacres against Tutsi were perpetrated,{{sfn|Longman|2017|p=126}} as anti-Tutsi violence under the Habyarimana regime had been low level only up to that point.{{sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica}}\n\n=== Kagame's reorganisation of the RPF ===\n[[File:RwandaVolcanoAndLake cropped2.jpg|thumb|The [[Virunga Mountains]], the RPF base from 1990 to 1991|alt=Photograph of a lake with one of the Virunga Mountains behind, partially in cloud]]\nPaul Kagame was still in the United States at the time of the outbreak of war, attending the military training course in Fort Leavenworth.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=64}} He and Rwigyema had been in frequent contact by telephone throughout his stay in Kansas, planning the final details for the October invasion.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=63}} At the end of September Kagame informed the college that he was leaving the course, and was settling his affairs ready to return to Africa as the invasion began.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=64}} The college allowed him to leave with several textbooks, which he later used in planning tactics for the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=64}} When Kagame learned of Rwigyema's death on 5 October, he departed immediately to take command of the RPF troops.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=67}} He flew through [[London]] and [[Addis Ababa]] to [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe Airport]], where he was given safe passage by a friend in the Ugandan secret service;{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=75\u201376}} the police considered arresting him, but with Museveni out of the country and no specific orders, they allowed him to pass.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}} Ugandan associates drove Kagame to the border and he crossed into Rwanda early on 15 October.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}}\n\nThe RPF were in disarray by the time Kagame arrived, with troop morale very low.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}} He later described his arrival as one of the worst experiences of his life; the troops lacked organisation following Rwigyema's death and were demoralised after their losses in the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}} Kagame was well known to the RPF troops, many of whom had fought with him in the Ugandan Army, and they welcomed his arrival in the field.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=78\u201379}} He spent the following weeks gathering intelligence with senior officers.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=79}} By the end of October, with the RPF forced back to the Ugandan border, Kagame decided it was futile to continue fighting.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=79}} He therefore withdrew most of the army from north-eastern Rwanda, moving them to the [[Virunga mountains]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=79}} Kagame knew that the rugged terrain of the Virungas offered protection from attacks, even if the RPF's position was discovered.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=114\u2013115}} The march west took almost a week during which the soldiers crossed the border into Uganda several times, with the permission of President Museveni, taking advantage of personal friendships between the RPF soldiers and their ex-colleagues in the Ugandan Army.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=80}}\n\nMeanwhile, some RPF soldiers remained as a [[Decoy#Military decoy|decoy]] to carry out small-scale attacks on the Rwandan Army, who remained unaware of the Front's relocation.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=80}} The reorientation towards [[guerrilla warfare]] began with a raid on a Rwandan customs post across the border from [[Katuna]].{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|pp=112\u2013113}} Following the attack, the Rwandan Government accused Uganda of deliberately sheltering the RPF.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=114}} The RPF's new tactics inflicted heavy casualties on the Rwandan Army, which reacted by shelling Ugandan territory. Ugandan civilians were killed and a significant amount of damage to property was incurred, and there were reports of Rwandan troops crossing the border to loot and abduct locals.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|pp=115\u2013116}}\n\nConditions in the Virungas were very harsh for the RPF. At an altitude of almost {{convert|5000|m|ft}},{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} there was no ready availability of food or supplies and, lacking warm clothing, several soldiers froze to death or lost limbs in the [[Alpine climate|high-altitude cold climate]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=80}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} Kagame spent the next two months reorganising the army, without carrying out any military operations.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} [[Alexis Kanyarengwe]], a Hutu colonel who had worked with Habyarimana but had fallen out with him and gone into exile, joined the RPF and was appointed chairman of the organisation.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} Another Hutu, [[Seth Sendashonga]], became the RPF's liaison with Rwandan opposition parties.{{sfn|Des Forges|1999|loc=[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno15-8-03.htm The Rwandan Patriotic Front]}} Most of the other senior recruits at the time were Ugandan-based Tutsi.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} Personnel numbers grew steadily, volunteers coming from the exile communities in Burundi, Zaire and other countries.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=116}} Kagame maintained tight discipline in his army, enforcing a regimented training routine, as well as a large set of rules for soldier conduct.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=83}} Soldiers were expected to pay for goods purchased in the community, refrain from alcohol and drugs, and to establish a good reputation for the RPF amongst the local population.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=83}} The RPF punished personnel who broke these rules, sometimes with beatings, while more serious offences such as murder, rape, and desertion, were punishable by death.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=83}}\n\nThe RPF carried out a major fundraising programme, spearheaded by Financial Commissioner [[Aloisia Inyumba]] in Kampala.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} They received donations from Tutsi exiles around the world,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=82}} as well as from businessmen within Rwanda who had fallen out with the government.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=117}} The sums involved were not enormous but, with tight financial discipline and a leadership willing to lead frugal lives, the RPF was able to grow its operational capability.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=118}} It obtained its weapons and ammunition from a variety of sources, including the open market, taking advantage of a surplus of weaponry at the end of the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=118}} It is likely they also received weaponry from officers in the Ugandan Army; according to G\u00e9rard Prunier, Ugandans who had fought with Kagame in the Bush War remained loyal to him and secretly passed weaponry to the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Museveni likely knew of this but was able to claim ignorance when dealing with the international community.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Museveni later said that \"faced with [a] ''fait accompli'' situation by our Rwandan brothers\", Uganda went \"to help the RPF, materially, so that they are not defeated because that would have been detrimental to the Tutsi people of Rwanda and would not have been good for Uganda's stability\".{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=183}} Journalist Justus Muhanguzi Kampe reported that the taking of military equipment by deserted Tutsi members of the Ugandan Army meant that the national arsenal \"nearly got depleted\"; he suspected that the war \"must have had a tremendous financial impact on the Ugandan government, especially Uganda's military budget\", costing the country \"trillions of shillings\".{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|pp=117, 121}}\n\n=== Attack on Ruhengeri, January 1991 ===\n[[File:Ruhengeri.jpg|thumb|The town of [[Ruhengeri]], with the [[Virunga Mountains]] in the background|alt=Photograph of Ruhengeri, Rwanda, with buildings, a street, and people visible, and mountains in the background, partially in cloud]]\nAfter three months of regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to fight again.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=87}} The target for the first attack was the northern city of [[Ruhengeri]],{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=87}} south of the Virunga mountains.{{sfn|ITMB Publishing}} The city was the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north-west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region as the heartland of the regime.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence and Kagame hoped this would destabilise the government.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}}\n\nDuring the night of 22 January, seven hundred RPF fighters descended from the mountains into hidden locations around the city, assisted by RPF sympathisers living in the area.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} They attacked on the morning of 23 January.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=120}} The Rwandan forces were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} The Rwandan Police and army succeeded in briefly repelling the invasion in areas around their stations, killing large numbers of rebel fighters in the process.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} It is likely the Rwandan Army forces were assisted by French troops, as the French Government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} By noon, the defending forces were defeated and the RPF held the whole city.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} Most of the civilian population fled.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=127}}\n\nOne of the principal RPF targets in Ruhengeri was the prison, which was Rwanda's largest.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} When he learnt of the invasion the warden, {{interlanguage link|Charles Uwihoreye|fr}}, telephoned the government in Kigali to request instructions.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=120}} He spoke to Colonel [[Elie Sagatwa]], one of the ''akazu'', who ordered him to kill every inmate in the prison to avoid escape and defections during the fighting.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} He also wanted to prevent high-profile political prisoners and former insiders from sharing secret information with the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Uwihoreye refused to obey, even after Sagatwa called him and repeated the order, having confirmed it with the president.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} Eventually, the RPF stormed the buildings and the prisoners were liberated.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} Several prisoners were recruited into the RPF, including [[Th\u00e9oneste Lizinde]], a former close ally of President Habyarimana, who had been arrested following a failed coup attempt in 1980.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}}\n\nThe RPF forces held Ruhengeri through the afternoon of 23 January, before withdrawing into the mountains for the night.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} The raid undermined the Rwandan Government's claims that the RPF had been ejected from the country and had been reduced to conducting guerrilla operations from Uganda.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=127}} The government sent troops to the city the following day and a [[state of emergency]] was declared, with strict curfews in Ruhengeri and the surrounding area.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} The RPF raided the city almost every night for several months, fighting with Rwandan army forces, and the country was back at war for the first time since the October invasion.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}}\n\n=== Guerrilla war, 1991\u20131992 ===\nFollowing the action in Ruhengeri the RPF again began to wage guerrilla war.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=135}} The Rwandan Army massed troops across the north of the country, occupying key positions and shelling RPF hideouts in the Virunga mountains, but the mountainous terrain prevented them from launching an all-out assault.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=90}} Paul Kagame's troops attacked the Rwandan Army forces repeatedly and frequently, keen to ensure that the diplomatic and psychological effect of the RPF's resurgence was not lost.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=91}} Kagame employed tactics such as attacking simultaneously in up to ten locations across the north of the country, to prevent his opponents from concentrating their force in any one place.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=91}} This low intensity war continued for many months, both sides launching successful attacks on the other, and neither able to gain the upper hand in the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=91}} The RPF made some territorial gains including capturing the border town of [[Gatuna]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=135}} This was significant as it blocked Rwanda's access to the port of [[Mombasa]] via the [[Northern Corridor]], forcing all trade to go through Tanzania via the longer and costlier [[Central Corridor (Africa)|Central Corridor]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=135}} By late 1991 the RPF controlled 5% of Rwanda, setting up its new headquarters in an abandoned tea factory near [[Mulindi]], Byumba province.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=96}} Many Hutu civilians in areas captured by the RPF fled to government-held areas, creating a large population of [[internally displaced persons]] in the country.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=136}}\n\nThe renewed warfare had two effects in Rwanda. The first was a resurgence of violence against Tutsi still in the country. Hutu activists killed up to 1,000 Tutsi in attacks authorised by local officials, starting with the slaughter of 30\u201360 [[Bagogwe]] Tutsi pastoralists near [[Kinigi]] and then moving south and west to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=136\u2013137}} These attacks continued until June 1991, when the government introduced measures to allow potential victims to move to safer areas such as Kigali.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=136\u2013137}} The ''akazu'' also began a major propaganda campaign, broadcasting and publishing material designed to persuade the Hutu population that the Tutsi were a separate and alien people, non-Christians seeking to re-establish the old Rwandan feudal monarchy with the final goal of enslaving the Hutu.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=98}} This included the [[Hutu Ten Commandments]], a set of \"rules\" published in the ''[[Kangura]]'' magazine, mandating Hutu supremacy in all aspects of Rwandan life.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=92\u201394}} In response the RPF opened its own propaganda radio station, [[Radio Muhabura]], which broadcast from Uganda into Rwanda. This was never hugely popular but gained listenership during 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Des Forges|1999|loc=[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno1-3-10.htm Propaganda and Practice]}}\n\nThe second development was that President Habyarimana announced that he was introducing multi-party politics into the country, following intense pressure from the international community, including his most loyal ally France.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=97}} Habyarimana had originally promised this in mid-1990, and opposition groups had formed in the months since, including the [[Republican Democratic Movement]] (MDR), [[Social Democratic Party (Rwanda)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) and the [[Liberal Party (Rwanda)|Liberal Party]] (PL),{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=123\u2013124}} but the one-party state law had remained in place.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=127}} In mid-1991 Habyarimana officially allowed multi-party politics to begin, a change that saw a plethora of new parties come into existence.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=127}}{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=66\u221267}} Many had manifestos which favoured full democracy and rapprochement with the RPF,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=97}} but these were quite ineffective and had no political influence.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=127}} The older opposition groups registered themselves as official parties and the country was notionally moving towards a multi-party inclusive cabinet with proper representation, but progress was continually hampered by the regime. The last opposition party to form was the [[Coalition for the Defence of the Republic]] (CDR),{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=69}} which was more hardline Hutu than Habyarimana's own party and had close links to the ''akazu''.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=98}}\n\nProgress remained slow in 1991 and 1992. A cabinet set up in October 1991 contained almost no opposition, and the administrative hierarchy across the country only recognised the authority of Habyarimana's National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=134}} Another one-party cabinet was announced in January 1992 which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, forcing Habyarimana to make real concessions.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=103}} He announced his intention to negotiate with the RPF,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=103}} and formed a multi-party cabinet in April. This was still dominated by Habyarimana's party, but with opposition figures in some key positions.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=145}} The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and negotiated a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began peace negotiations in the Tanzanian city of [[Arusha]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=150}}\n\n===Peace process, 1992\u20131993===\nThe peace process was complicated by the fact that four distinct groups were involved, each with its own agenda. The Hutu hardliners, centred around the family of Agathe Habyarimana, were represented by the CDR as well as extremists within the president's own MRND party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=161}} The second group was the official opposition, which excluded the CDR. They had much more democratic and conciliatory aims but were also deeply suspicious of the RPF, whom they saw as trying to upset the \"democratic\" policy of Hutu rule established in the 1959 revolution.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=151}} The third group was the RPF. Paul Kagame engaged with the peace process against the advice of some of his senior officers, in the knowledge that many of those on the other side of the table were hardliners who were not sincerely interested in negotiations. He feared that shunning the opportunity for peace would weaken the RPF politically and lose them international goodwill.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=97}} Finally there was the group representing President Habyarimana himself, who sought primarily to hold on to his power in whatever form he could. This meant publicly striving for a middle ground compromise solution, but privately obstructing the process and trying to delay change to the status quo for as long as possible.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=161}} Habyarimana recognised the danger posed to him by the radical Hutu faction and attempted in mid-1992 to remove them from senior army positions. This effort was only partially successful; ''akazu'' affiliates [[Augustin Ndindiliyimana]] and [[Th\u00e9oneste Bagosora]] remained in influential posts, providing them with a link to power.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=167}}\n\nThe delegates at the negotiations in Arusha made some progress in the latter half of 1992, despite wrangling between Habyarimana and hardline members of his party that compromised the government officials' negotiating power.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=162}} In August the parties agreed a \"pluralistic transitional government\", which would include the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=162}} The CDR and hardline faction of the MRND reacted violently to this. Feeling sidelined by the developing Arusha process,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=163}} they began killing Tutsi civilians in the [[Kibuye, Rwanda|Kibuye]] area; 85 were killed, and 500 homes burnt.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=162}} Historian G\u00e9rard Prunier names late 1992 as the time when the idea of a genocidal \"final solution\" to kill every Tutsi in Rwanda was first mooted.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=169}} Hardliners were busy setting up parallel institutions within the official organs of state, including the army, from which they hoped to effect a move away from the more conciliatory tone adopted by Habyarimana and the moderate opposition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=169}} Their goal was to take over from Habyarimana's government as the perceived source of power in the country amongst the Hutu masses, to maintain the line that the RPF and Tutsi more generally were a threat to Hutu freedoms, and to find a way to thwart any agreement negotiated in Arusha.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=170}}\n\nThe situation deteriorated in early 1993 when the teams in Arusha signed a full power-sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF and other major opposition parties, but excluding the CDR.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}}{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=140\u2212141}} This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until free and fair elections could be held.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}} The agreement reflected the balance of power at the time; Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition, and the RPF all accepted it, but the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}} MRND national secretary [[Mathieu Ngirumpatse]] announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}} The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger killing spree than those that had previously occurred.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The violence engulfed the whole north-west of Rwanda and lasted for six days; many houses were burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}}{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}}\n\n===RPF offensive, February 1993===\n[[File:RwandaTerritoryAfterFeb1993.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The partition of Rwanda following the RPF offensive in February 1993.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=xx}} For the first time, the Rwandan Government acknowledged that it had lost part of the country.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}}|alt=Map showing the partition of Rwanda between government, RPF, and demilitarised zones.]]\nPaul Kagame responded by pulling out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six-month cease-fire.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}}{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=80}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}} The RPF cited the CDR and MRND-hardliner violence as its reason for this, but according to foreign policy scholar [[Bruce D.

By demonstrating its military power in the field, through a successful offensive against the Rwandan Government forces, the RPF was able to secure an increased percentage of troops in the agreement.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}}\n\nThe RPF began its offensive on 8 February, fighting southwards from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} In contrast to the October 1990 and 1991\u20131992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met by weak resistance from the Rwandan Army forces.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The likely reason was a significant deterioration in morale and military experience within the government forces.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The impact of the long-running war on the economy, and a heavy devaluation of the [[Rwandan franc]],{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=159}} had left the government struggling to pay its soldiers regularly.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one-year.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready,{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}}\n\nThe RPF advance continued unchecked in February, its forces moving steadily south and gaining territory without opposition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} They took Ruhengeri on the first day of fighting,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} and later the city of [[Byumba]]. Local Hutu civilians fled ''en masse'' from the areas the RPF were taking, most of them ending up in refugee camps on the outskirts of Kigali.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=81}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} The civilian cost of the offensive is unclear; according to Andr\u00e9 Guichaoua several thousand were killed,{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=81}} while Prunier labelled the RPF killing as \"small-scale\".{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} This violence alienated the rebels from their potential allies in the democratic Rwandan opposition parties.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=176}}\n\nWhen it became clear that the Rwandan Army was losing ground to the RPF, Habyarimana requested urgent assistance from France.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}} Fearing that the RPF could soon be in a position to seize Kigali, the French immediately dispatched 150 troops to Rwanda,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}} along with arms and ammunition, to bolster the Rwandan Army forces.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=176}} A further 250 French soldiers were sent on 20 February.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}} The arrival of French troops in Kigali significantly changed the military situation on the ground. The RPF now found themselves under attack, French shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=105}}\n\nBy 20 February the RPF had advanced to within {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} of the capital, [[Kigali]],{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=177}} and many observers believed an assault on the city was imminent.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} The assault did not take place, and the RPF instead declared a cease-fire.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=177}} Whether or not the RPF intended to advance on the capital is unknown. Kagame later stated that his aim at this point was to inflict as much damage as possible on Rwandan Army forces, capture their weapons, and gain ground slowly, but not to attack the capital or seek to end the war with an outright RPF victory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}} Kagame told journalist and author [[Stephen Kinzer]] that such a victory would have ended international goodwill towards the RPF and led to charges that the war had simply been a bid to replace the Hutu state with a Tutsi one.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}} The increased presence of French troops and the fierce loyalty of the Hutu population to the government meant that an invasion of Kigali would not have been achieved with the same ease that the RPF had conquered the north. Fighting for the capital would have been a much more difficult and dangerous operation.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=178}} Several of Kagame's senior officers urged him to go for outright victory but he overruled them.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=105}} By the end of the February war over one million civilians, mostly Hutu, had left their homes in the country's largest exodus to date.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=105}}\n\n===Arusha Accords and rise of Hutu Power, 1993\u20131994===\n{{main|Arusha Accords (Rwanda)}}\n[[File:AICC Arusha.jpg|thumb|The [[Arusha International Conference Centre]], venue for peace talks to end the war|alt=Photograph showing the front entrance of the Arusha International Conference Centre]]\nThe RPF cease-fire was followed by two days of negotiations in the Ugandan capital [[Kampala]], attended by RPF leader Paul Kagame, and involving President Museveni and representatives of European nations.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} The Europeans insisted that RPF forces withdraw to the zone they had held before the February offensive. Kagame responded that he would only agree to this if the Rwandan army were forbidden from re-entering the newly conquered territory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} Following a threat by Kagame to resume fighting and potentially take even more territory, the two sides reached a compromise deal. This entailed the RPF withdrawing to its pre-February territory, but also mandated the setting up of a demilitarised zone between the RPF area and the rest of the country.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} The deal was significant because it marked a formal concession by Habyarimana's regime of the northern zone to the rebels, recognising the RPF hold on that territory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} There were many within the RPF senior command who felt that Kagame had ceded too much, because the deal meant not only withdrawal to the pre-February boundaries, but also a promise not to encroach on the demilitarised zone. This therefore ended RPF ambitions of capturing more territory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} Kagame used the authority he had accumulated through his successful leadership of the RPF to override these concerns, and the parties returned once more to the negotiating table in Arusha.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=107}}\n\nDespite the agreement and ongoing negotiations President Habyarimana, supported by the French Government,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=178}} spent the subsequent months forging a \"common front\" against the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=179}} This included members of his own party and the CDR and also factions from each of the other opposition parties in the power-sharing coalition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=179}} At the same time other members of the same parties issued a statement, in conjunction with the RPF, in which they condemned French involvement in the country and called for the Arusha process to be respected in full.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=179}} The hardline factions within the parties became known as [[Hutu Power]], a movement which transcended party politics.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=188}} Apart from the CDR there was no party that was exclusively part of the Power movement.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=181\u2013182}} Instead almost every party was split into \"moderate\" and \"Power\" wings, with members of both camps claiming to represent the legitimate leadership of that party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=181\u2013182}} Even the ruling party contained a Power wing, consisting of those who opposed Habyarimana's intention to sign a peace deal.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=182}} Several radical youth militia groups emerged, attached to the Power wings of the parties; these included the ''[[Interahamwe]]'', which was attached to the ruling party,{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=129}} and the CDR's ''[[Impuzamugambi]]''.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=165}} The youth militia began actively carrying out massacres across the country.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=25}} The army trained the militias, sometimes in conjunction with the French, who were unaware of the fact that the training they provided was being used to perpetrate the mass killings.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=165}}\n\nBy June President Habyarimana had come to view Hutu Power, rather than the mainstream opposition, as the biggest threat to his leadership.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=186}} This led him to change tactics and engage fully with the Arusha peace process, giving it the impetus it needed to draw to a completion.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=186}} According to Prunier this support was more symbolic than genuine. Habyarimana believed that he could maintain power more easily through a combination of limited concessions to the opposition and RPF than he could if Hutu Power were allowed to disrupt the peace process.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=186}} The negotiation of troop numbers was protracted and difficult; twice the talks almost collapsed.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} The Rwandan Government wanted to allocate only 15% of the officer corps to the RPF, reflecting the proportion of Tutsi in the country, while the RPF was arguing for a 50/50 split.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} The RPF were in a superior position following their successful February campaign and were backed in their demands by Tanzania, which was chairing the talks.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} The government eventually agreed to their demands.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=193}} As well as 50% of the officer corps, the RPF was allocated up to 40% of the non-command troops.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=193}} The deal also mandated large-scale demobilisation; of the 35,000 Rwandan Army and 20,000 RPF soldiers at the time of the accords, only 19,000 would be drafted into the new national army.{{sfn|IPEP|2000|pp=49\u201350}} With all details agreed the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] were finally signed on 4 August 1993 at a formal ceremony attended by President Habyarimana as well as heads of state from neighbouring countries.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=191}}\n\nAn uneasy peace was once again entered into, which would last until 7 April of the following year. The agreement called for a United Nations [[peacekeeping]] force; this was titled the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR), and was in place in Rwanda by October 1993{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=98}} under the command of Canadian General [[Rom\u00e9o Dallaire]].{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=42}} Another stipulation of the agreement was that the RPF would station diplomats in Kigali at the ''Conseil national de d\u00e9veloppement'' (CND), now known as the [[Chamber of Deputies (Rwanda)|Chamber of Deputies]], Rwanda's Parliament building.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=130}} These men were protected by 600\u20131,000 RPF soldiers, who arrived in Kigali through UNAMIR's [[Operation Clean Corridor]] in December 1993.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=130}} Meanwhile, the Hutu Power wings of the various parties were beginning plans for a genocide.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} The President of Burundi, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], who had been elected in June as the country's first ever Hutu president, [[1993 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|was assassinated]] by extremist Tutsi army officers in October 1993.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=199}} The assassination reinforced the notion among Hutus that the Tutsi were their enemy and could not be trusted.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} The CDR and the Power wings of the other parties realised they could use this situation to their advantage.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} The idea of a \"final solution\", which had first been suggested in 1992 but had remained a fringe viewpoint, was now top of their agenda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} An informant from the ''Interahamwe'' told UNAMIR officials that a group of Hutu extremists were planning on disrupting the peace process and killing Tutsis in Kigali.<ref>{{cite AV media| people = Greg Barker (Director)| title = Ghosts of Rwanda| medium = Television production| publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service]]| date = 1 April 2004| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ghosts/}}</ref>\n\n===Military operations during the 1994 genocide===\n{{main|Rwandan genocide}}\n[[File:RPF advance Rwandan Genocide cropped 1994.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map showing the advance of the RPF during the Rwandan genocide of 1994.{{sfn|Kuperman|2001|p=41}}|alt=Map showing the advance of the RPF during the Rwandan genocide of 1994]]\nThe cease-fire ended abruptly on 6 April 1994 when President Habyarimana's plane [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|was shot down]] near [[Kigali Airport]], killing both Habyarimana and the new [[List of Presidents of Burundi|President of Burundi]], [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]].{{sfn|National Assembly of France|1998}}{{sfn|BBC News (I)|2010}} The pair were returning home from a regional summit in [[Dar es Salaam]] at which the leaders of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, had urged Habyarimana to stop delaying the implementation of the Arusha accords.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=211}} The attackers remain unknown.

These included the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) and ''[[Gacaca]]'', a traditional village court system reintroduced to handle the large caseloads involved.{{sfn|Bowcott|2014}}\n\n===Refugee crisis, insurgency, and Congo wars===\n{{main|Great Lakes refugee crisis|First Congo War|Second Congo War}}\n[[File:Rwandan refugee camp in east Zaire.jpg|thumb|[[Refugee camp]] in [[Zaire]], 1994|alt=View of refugee camp on foggy day, showing tents of various colours and the refugees]]\nFollowing the RPF victory, approximately two million Hutu fled to refugee camps in neighbouring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan genocide.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=312}} The camps were crowded and squalid and tens of thousands of refugees died in disease epidemics, including [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]].{{sfn|UNHCR|2000}}{{sfn|Siddique|1994}} They were set up by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=313\u2013314}} who began to rearm in a bid to return to power in Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=381\u2013382}}{{sfn|Pomfret|1997}}\n\nBy late 1996, Hutu militants from the camps were launching regular cross-border incursions and the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched a counter-offensive.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=382}} Rwanda provided troops and military training{{sfn|Pomfret|1997}} to the [[Banyamulenge]], a Tutsi group in the Zairian [[South Kivu]] province,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=384\u2013385}} helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the Banyamulenge, and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked the refugee camps, targeting the Hutu militia.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=384\u2013385}}{{sfn|Pomfret|1997}} These attacks caused hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee;{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=118}} many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=122\u2013123}} The refugees fleeing further into Zaire were relentlessly pursued by the RPA under the cover of the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo|AFDL]] rebellion,{{sfn|Reyntjens|2013|pages=110\u2013115}} killing an estimated 232,000 people.{{sfn|Emizet|2000|pp=163, 178\u2013179}} The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=209}} supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north-western provinces.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=216}} By 1999 a programme of

defeated.{{sfn|Brittain|1999}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=215\u2013218}}\n\nAs well as dismantling the refugee camps, Kagame began planning a war to remove Mobutu.{{sfn|Pomfret|1997}} Mobutu had supported the ''genocidaires'' based in the camps and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire.{{sfn|Byman|Chalk|Hoffman|Rosenau|2001|p=18}} The Rwandan and Ugandan governments supported an alliance of four rebel groups headed by [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]], which began waging the [[First Congo War]].{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=113\u2013116}} The rebels quickly took control of North and South Kivu provinces and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=128\u2013133}} They controlled the whole country by May 1997.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=136}} Mobutu fled into exile and the country was renamed [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC).{{sfn|BBC News (II)}} Rwanda fell out with the new Congolese regime in 1998 and Kagame supported a fresh rebellion, leading to the [[Second Congo War]].{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=182\u2013183}} This lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and severe damage.{{sfn|BBC News (II)}} A 2010 United Nations report accused the [[Rwandan Patriotic Army]] of wide-scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity during the two Congo wars, charges denied by the Rwandan Government.{{sfn|McGreal|2010}}\n\nIn 2015 the Rwandan government paid reparations to Uganda for damage inflicted during the civil war to its border

name='Kurkjian'/> Under his rule, Armenian power in Cilicia was at its apogee: his kingdom extended from [[Isauria]] to the [[Nur Mountains|Amanus Mountains]].<ref name='Nersessian'/>\n\nIn 1194\u20131195, when he was planning to receive the title of [[king]], he instituted [[Full communion|a union]] of the [[Holy See of Cilicia|Armenian church]] with [[Pope|Rome]].<ref name='Hardwicke'/> With the signing of the Act of Union, his [[coronation]] proceeded without delay.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> He was consecrated as king on 6 January 1198<ref name='Runciman'/> or 1199, in the Church of Holy Wisdom at [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]].<ref name='Ghazarian'/> His accession to the throne of Cilicia as its first Armenian monarch heralded into reality not merely an official end to Cilicia's shadowy umbilical connection to the [[Byzantine Empire]], but also a new era of ecclesiastical co-operation with the West.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> A skilled diplomat and wise politician, Leo established useful alliances with many of the contemporary rulers; he also gained the friendship and support of the [[Hospitallers]] and the [[Teutonic Knights]] by granting considerable territories to them.<ref name='Nersessian'/><ref name='Edwards'/>\n\nHe envisioned annexing the [[Principality of Antioch]] to his kingdom, thus reinforcing his authority along much of the northeastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coastline.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> Levon first put this plan into action in 1194 by seizing the strategic fortress of [[Baghras]] after [[Saladin]], the Sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]],<ref name='Runciman'/> had abandoned it.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> His greatest triumph was achieved at the beginning of 1216 when at the head of his army he occupied [[Antioch]] and installed his grandnephew, [[Raymond-Roupen, Prince of Antioch|Raymond-Roupen]] as its head.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> Raymond-Roupen remained in power until Leo's death.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> The transforming of the Armenian [[Royal Household|court]], following the pattern of the Frankish courts, proceeded at a more rapid pace after Leo came to power.<ref name='Nersessian'/> Many of the old names of specific functions or the titles of dignitaries were replaced by [[Latin]] ones and the changes in nomenclature were often accompanied by changes in the character of these offices.<ref name='Nersessian'/>\n\nCommerce was greatly developed during the reign of Leo:<ref name='Nersessian'/> he granted charters regarding trade and commercial [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s to [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]].<ref name='Ghazarian'/> These [[charters]] provided their holders with special [[tax exemption]]s in exchange for their merchandising trade.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> They encouraged the establishment of [[Italians|Italian]] merchant communities in Tarsus, [[Adana]] and [[Mamistra]], and became a large source of revenue for the growth and development of Cilician Armenia.<ref name='Ghazarian'/>\n\n==Early years==\nHe was the younger son of [[Stephen of Armenia|Stephen]], the third son of [[Leo I, Prince of Armenia|Leo I, lord of Armenian Cilicia]].<ref name='Cawley'/> His mother was [[Rita of Barbaron|Rita]], a daughter of [[Lords of Barbaron|Sempad, Lord of Barbaron]].<ref name='Cawley'/> Leo's father, who was on his way to attend a banquet given by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] governor of [[Cilicia]], [[Andronicus Euphorbenus]],<ref name='Ghazarian'/> was murdered<ref name='Runciman'/> on  7 February 1165.<ref name='Cawley'/> Following their father's death, Leo and his elder brother Roupen lived with their maternal uncle, [[Lords of Barbaron|Pagouran]], lord of the fortress of [[Barbaron]], protecting the [[Cilician Gates]] pass in the [[Taurus Mountains]].<ref name='Ghazarian'/><ref name='Edwards'/>\n\nTheir paternal uncle, [[Mleh, Prince of Armenia|Mleh I, lord of Armenian Cilicia]] had made a host of enemies by his cruelties in his country, resulting in his assassination by his own soldiers in [[Kozan, Adana|the city of Sis]] in 1175.<ref name='Kurkjian'/> The seigneurs of Cilician Armenia elected Leo's brother, Roupen III to occupy the throne of the principality.<ref name='Kurkjian'/> In 1183, [[Hethum III of Lampron]], allied with Prince [[Bohemond III of Antioch]], began joint hostilities against Roupen III<ref name='Ghazarian'/> who sent Leo to surround Hethum's mountain lair.<ref name='Kurkjian'/> But Bohemond III, rushing to the aid of Hethum, treacherously made Roupen prisoner.<ref name='Kurkjian'/>\n\nHis brother's absence gave Leo the opportunity to put his sharp political skills to practice as the interim guardian of the [[Rubenids|Roupenian House]].<ref name='Ghazarian'/> Roupen's release required payment of a large ransom, and the submission of Adana and Mamistra as vassalages to Antioch.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> When Roupen returned from the captivity, he transferred the power to his brother, Leo (1187) and retired to the monastery of Trazarg.<ref name='Nersessian'/>\n\n==His rule==\n\n===Prince of Cilicia===\nThe menace of the recent alliance between the Byzantine Emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]] and [[Saladin]], and the more immediate threat of the [[Oghuz Turks|Turkomans]], led to a rapprochement between Leo and Bohemond III:<ref name='Nersessian'/> on his accession Leo sought an alliance with the prince of Antioch and recognized his suzerainty.<ref name='Runciman'/> Large bands of the nomad Turkomans had been crossing the northern borders, advancing almost as far as Sis and laying waste on all sides;<ref name='Nersessian'/> the two princes joined to beat off a Turcoman raid in 1187.<ref name='Runciman'/> Leo could muster only a small force, but he attacked them with such energy that he routed the bands, killed their leader, and pursued the fugitives as far as [[Sarventikar]], inflicting heavy losses on them.<ref name='Nersessian'/> Soon afterwards (between 3 February 1188/4 February 1189),<ref name='Cawley'/> Leo married [[Isabella (wife of Leo I of Armenia)|Isabella]], a niece of Bohemond III's wife [[Sybilla (wife of Bohemond III of Antioch)|Sibylla]].<ref name='Runciman'/>\n\nThe following year (1188), taking advantage of the troubled condition in the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] that preceded the death of [[Kilij Arslan II]], Leo turned against the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuks]].<ref name='Nersessian'/> A surprise attack on Bragana was unsuccessful, but Leon returned two months later with a larger army, killed the head of the garrison, seized the fortress and marched into Isauria.<ref name='Nersessian'/> Though we find no specific mention of it, Seleucia must have been captured about this time.<ref name='Nersessian'/> Proceeding northwards, Leo seized Heraclea, gave it up after payment to him a large sum, and advanced as far as Caesarea.<ref name='Nersessian'/>\n\n{{Quote|Leo was a valiant and learned prince; he enlarged his principality and became the master of many provinces. A few days only after his taking possession of the country, [[Ishmaelites|the descendants of Ismael]], under the command of one Roustam, advanced and came against Cilicia. Leo was not frightened, but confiding in [[God]], who destroyed [[Sennacherib|Sanacherib]], he vanquished with a few men the great army of the infidels. Roustam himself being killed by [[St. George]], the whole [[Hagarenes|Hagarenian]] army then fled and dispersed; the Armenians pursued them and enriched themselves by the booty. The power of Leo thus increased, and being confident in his strength, he chased the Tadjiks [name used by Armenian chroniclers to designate the Saracens, particularly the Seljuks] and pursued the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]]; he conquered Isauria and came as far as [[Iconium]]; he captured [[Heraclea Cybistra|Heraclea]], and again gave it up for a large ransom; he blockaded [[Kayseri|Caesarea]], and had nearly taken it; he made a treaty with the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Sultan of Iconium]], and received a large sum of money from him; he surrounded Cilicia on every side with forts and castles; he built a new church called Agner, and was exceedingly generous to all [[monastery|monasteries]] erected by his ancestors; his bounty extended itself even to the [[Leprosy|leprous]];

therefore, Leo took Bohemond's family and court off to Sis as prisoners.<ref name='Hardwicke'/>\n\nBohemond III agreed to surrender Antioch in exchange for his freedom, sending the [[Officers of the Principality of Antioch#Marshal|Marshal]] Bartholomew Tirel and Richard L\u2019Erminet to turn the city over to Armenian troops under [[Lords of Sassoun|Hethum of Sassoun]].<ref name='Hardwicke'/> When the delegation arrived at Antioch, the barons there were ready to accept Leo as overlord, and allowed Bartholomew Tirel to bring the Armenian soldiers into the city and establish them in the palace.<ref name='Runciman'/>\n\nHowever, after their initial entry, Antiochene resistance was spurred by the [[Clergy#Christian clergy#Catholic clergy|clergy]] and the [[Byzantine Greeks|Greeks]].<ref name='Hardwicke'/> A riot began in the palace and spread though the city; the Armenians left and prudently retired with Hethum of Sassoun back to Baghras.<ref name='Runciman'/> The citizens of Antioch, under the [[Latin Patriarch of Antioch]], [[Aimery of Limoges]], formed a [[Medieval commune|commune]] which recognized Bohemond III's eldest son, [[Raymond IV of Tripoli|Raymond]] as lord until his father should be released.<ref name='Hardwicke'/>\n\nAntioch then asked aid of King [[Henry II, Count of Champagne|Henry I of Jerusalem]] and Count [[Bohemond IV, Prince of Antioch|Bohemond I of Tripoli]] (the latter was Bohemond III's younger son).<ref name='Hardwicke'/> Early next spring, King Henry I sailed to [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], where young Bohemond joined him, and then went on to Antioch and Sis.<ref name='Hardwicke'/> Leo, unwilling to face an open war, met him before Sis, ready to negotiate a settlement.<ref name='Runciman'/> Bohemond III renounced his as a suzerain, and in return for this was allowed to go back to Antioch without paying a ransom.<ref name='Nersessian'/> Arrangements were also made for the marriage of Raymond of Antioch to Leo's niece,<ref name='Cawley'/> [[Alix of Armenia|Alice]].<ref name='Hardwicke'/> However, Raymond soon died and Bohemond III sent Alice back to Leo with her infant son Raymond-Roupen.<ref name='Hardwicke'/> Leo determined that this great-nephew of his should inherit Antioch on the death of Bohemond III.<ref name='Hardwicke'/>\n\n===Coronation as King===\n[[File:Cilician Armenia-en.svg|thumb|right|300 px|The [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] (1199\u20131375)]]\nLeo pressed with renewed energy his claims for a [[Crown (headgear)|royal crown]], seeking the assistance of the two most powerful rulers of the time, the [[pope]] and the [[Holy Roman Emperor|German emperor]].<ref name='Nersessian'/><ref name='Edwards'/> He sent to Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]];

No king of Hungary was regarded as having been truly legitimate without being crowned with it. In the [[history of Hungary]], more than fifty kings were crowned with it, up to the last, [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]], in 1916. The only kings who were not so crowned were Wladyslaw I, John II/Szapolyai J\u00e1nos Zsigmond and Joseph II. \n\nThe enamels on the crown are mainly or entirely Byzantine work, presumed to have been made in [[Constantinople]] in the 1070s. The crown was presented by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VII Doukas]] to King [[G\u00e9za I of Hungary]]; both are depicted and named in Greek on enamel plaques in the lower crown. It is one of the two known Byzantine crowns to survive, the other being the slightly earlier [[Monomachus Crown]], which is also in Budapest, in the [[Hungarian National Museum]].<ref>Beckwith, 214</ref><ref>B\u00e0r\u00e0ny-Oberschall (1949)</ref> However, the Monomachus Crown may have had another function, and the Holy Crown has probably been remodelled, and uses elements of different origins.  The date assigned to the present configuration of the Holy Crown varies, but is most commonly put around the late 12th century.<ref>L\u00e1szl\u00f3, 425</ref>  The [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|Hungarian coronation]] insignia consists of the Holy Crown, the sceptre, the orb, and the mantle. The orb has the coat-of-arms of [[Charles I of Hungary]] (1310\u20131342).  In popular tradition the Holy Crown was thought to be older, dating to the time of the first King [[Stephen I of Hungary]], crowned in 1000/1001.\n\nIt was first called the Holy Crown in 1256. During the 14th century, royal power came to be represented not simply by a crown, but by just one specific object: the Holy Crown. This also meant that the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was a special state: they were not looking for a crown to inaugurate a king, but rather, they were looking for a king for the crown; as written by Crown Guard [[P\u00e9ter R\u00e9vay]]. He also depicts that \"the Holy Crown is for the Hungarians what the [[Ark of the Covenant|Lost Ark]] is for the Jewish people\".<ref>\"De sacra corona regni Hungariae ortu, virtuti, victoria, fortuna... brevis commentarius, 1613.</ref>\n\nSince 2000, the Holy Crown has been on display in the central Domed Hall of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]].\n\n== Specifications ==\n* The Crown's shape is elliptic (the width is 203.9&nbsp;mm, the length is 215.9&nbsp;mm) and is larger than a (healthy) human head. During coronations, the king had to wear a leather 'kapa' liner, made to fit, inside the crown.\n* The weight of the Crown is 2056&nbsp;g. (4&nbsp;lb 8.52 oz)\n* The gold-silver alloys in the upper and the lower parts of the Crown differ in alloy ratio.\n* The lower part of the Crown is asymmetric.<ref>N\u00e9meth Zsolt: A magyar Szent Korona, BKL Kiad\u00f3, 2007.</ref>\n\n== Holiness doctrine ==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}\n\nAs is the case with all European Christian crowns, it symbolizes a halo and thus signifies that the wearer rules by [[Divine right of kings|Divine Right]]. According to popular tradition, [[Stephen I of Hungary|St Stephen I]] held up the crown before his death (in the year 1038) to offer it to the [[Virgin Mary]] to seal a divine contract between her and the divine crown. After this, Mary was depicted not only as ''patrona'' (patron saint) for the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] but also as ''regina'' (i.e. \"queen\"). This contract was supposed to empower the crown with divine force to help the future kings of Hungary and did help reinforce the political system based on the so-called \"Doctrine of the Holy Crown\" ({{lang-hu|Szentkorona-tan}}).\n\n[[P\u00e9ter R\u00e9vay]], a Crown Guard, expounded this doctrine in his works ''Commentarius De Sacra Regni Hungariae Corona'' (Explanation of the Holy Crown of the Kingdom of Hungary, published in [[Augsburg]], 1613) and ''De monarchia et Sacra Corona Regni Hungariae'' (About the Monarchy and the Holy Crown of Hungary, [[Frankfurt]], 1659).\nAt the core of this doctrine was the notion that the crown itself had personhood and as a legal entity is identical to the state of Hungary. It is superior to the ruling monarch, who rules \"in the name of the crown\".\n\n==Origin==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[File:Fugger Chronicle Holy Crown of Hungary.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The crown depicted in the 15th-century [[Fugger Chronicle]].

It was created during the reign of [[B\u00e9la III]] under [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] influence. (The Hungarian king B\u00e9la III was brought up in the Byzantine court and was for a period the official heir to the throne there.)\nThe [[coronation|crowning]] of Stephen I, the first king of [[Hungary]], who was later [[canonization|canonized]] Saint Stephen, marks the beginning of Hungarian statehood. The date is variously given as Christmas 1000 or 1 January 1001.\n\nOne version of the origin of the crown is written by bishop [[Hartvik]] (between 1095\u20131116), in which the \"Pope\" has sent King Stephen I \"his blessings and a crown\". The basis for this belief is a biography by bishop Hartvik written around 1100\u20131110 at the request of King [[K\u00f6nyves K\u00e1lm\u00e1n]]. According to \"Hartvik\u2019s legend\", St Stephen sent Archbishop [[Astrik]] of [[Esztergom]] to [[Rome]] to ask for or require (both are possible from original [[Latin]] script) a crown from the \"[[Pope]]\", but it does not tell the name of the Pope. No matter how much Astrik hurried, the [[Poland|Polish]] prince, [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]]'s envoy was quicker, and the crown was prepared for the future Polish king. The Pope had seen a dream during the night, seeing the angel of the Lord telling him there will be another envoy from another nation, asking for a crown for their own king. The angel told the Pope: \"There will be another envoy from an unknown folk, who will ask for [or require] a crown, too, please give the crown to them, as they deserve it\". The next day Astrik approached the Pope so he gave the crown to him. \"Hartvik\u2019s legend\" appeared in the [[liturgical book]]s and breviaries in Hungary around 1200, recalling the then-existing Pope, [[Pope Sylvester II]].\n\nConsequently, the story of how the crown had been sent by Pope Sylvester II spread throughout the Christian world, so in 1613, crown guard P\u00e9ter R\u00e9vay states that the entire crown was given to St Stephen by [[Pope Sylvester II]]. However, this legend can be considered a myth, as Mieszko I was not living at the same time as either St. Stephen I or Pope Sylvester II. Also, in the \"Greater Legend\" of St Stephen, written around the time he was canonised (1083), we learn only that \"in the fifth year after the death of his father (...) they brought a Papal letter of blessings (...) and the Lord\u2019s favoured one, Stephen, was chosen to be king, and was anointed with oil and fortunately crowned with the diadem of royal honour\". This legend clearly lacks the information that the crown was from Rome. Moreover, there are no documents found in [[Vatican City]] on the granting of the crown, even though the Vatican has a clear interest in handing over the crown from Rome, as it is representing dominance over the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\nThere is another version on the origin of Holy Crown, which is a popular fallacy: Thietmar von Merseburg (died in 1018) reports that [[Otto III]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] has consented to the coronation of St. Stephen, and the Pope is sending his blessings; so many historians argued he has also sent a crown, however, does not report on any crown, so it cannot follow any fact.\n\nBeside the two main theories \u2013 donation by the pope and creation in the time of B\u00e9la III \u2013 there exist a number of different theories of the more romantic kind, putting the origin of the crown into the far past and into Asia.\n\nThe question to what extent the upper part of the Holy Crown indeed belonged to the crown of King Stephen I remained open until 1978, when the coronation insignia was returned to Hungary and a thorough examination could be carried out.\n\nThe differing styles and techniques used in making the enamel pictures and the fact that the inscriptions on the diadem are in Greek and on the bands in Latin suggest that the two parts were probably made in two different periods. However, we have to note that there are no known representations of any kind in which the crown is separated: the Holy Crown is always shown as one.\n\n==Type==\nThe Crown is a [[coronation crown]], which should be worn only on the occasion of a coronation, and for the rest of the time two crown guards (korona\u0151r) guard it. Apart from this, there are only two other people who can touch it, the ''[[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|n\u00e1dorisp\u00e1n]]'' (the highest secular title), who puts it onto a pillow during the coronation, and the [[Archdiocese of Esztergom|Archbishop of Esztergom]] ([[primate (bishop)|primate]] of Hungary, the highest ecclesiastical title), who places it on the head of the king.\n\n==Structure of the crown and its icons==\n[[File:SztKoronaEN.jpg|thumb|360px|Sketch of the enamel icons of the Saints on the Holy Crown (top view, the crown's front side is on the bottom of the image)]]\nThe Holy Crown was made of gold and decorated with nineteen enamel \"pantokrator\" picture (pantokrator is a Greek word meaning \"the master of the universe\") as well as semi-precious stones, genuine pearls, and [[almandine]]. It has three parts: \"abroncs\" (rim, hoop) (''corona graeca''),  \"keresztp\u00e1ntok\" (cross straps) (''corona latina''), and the cross on the top, which is today crooked.\n\nThere are four hanging pendants ([[pendilia]]) dangling from chains on each side of the diadem and one in the back.\n\n===Corona graeca===\nThe \"abroncs\" (rim, hoop) ''corona graeca'' (\"Greek Crown\") is 5.2&nbsp;cm wide with a diameter of 20.5&nbsp;cm.\n\nThe two aquamarine stones with cut surfaces on the back of the diadem were added as replacements by [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|King Matthias II]] (1608\u20131619). The enamel picture on the front depicts [[Christ Pantokrator]]. On the rim to the right and left of Jesus are pictures of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]], followed by half-length images of the Saints [[Saint George|George]] and [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Demetrius]], and [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas and Damian]].\n\n[[File:Michael VII Doukas on the Holy Crown.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VII Doukas]] on the ''corona graeca'' of the Holy Crown of Hungary]]\n[[File:G\u00e9za I.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hungarian King [[G\u00e9za I of Hungary|G\u00e9za I]] on the ''corona graeca'' of the Holy Crown of Hungary]]\n\nIn the arched frame on the back of the diadem [[Michael VII Doukas|Emperor Michael VII Doukas]] (1071\u20131078) is depicted. Below it to the left is the half-length picture of \"Kon. Porphyrogennetos\", this probably being either Emperor Michael's brother and co-emperor [[Konstantios Doukas]] or of his son and heir [[Constantine Doukas]], both having been [[Porphyrogenitos|born in the purple]]. To the right there is a picture of the Hungarian King [[G\u00e9za I]] (1074\u20131077), with the [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription: \"\u0393\u0395\u03a9\u0392\u0399\u03a4\u0396\u0391\u03f9 \u03a0\u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u03f9 \u039a\u03a1\u0391\u039b\u0397\u03f9 \u03a4\u039f\u03a5\u03a1\u039a\u0399\u0391\u03f9\" (''Ge\u014dbitzas pist\u00f3s kr\u00e1l\u0113s Tourk\u00edas'', meaning \"[[G\u00e9za I]], faithful [[kralj]] of the [[Hungary|land of the Turks]]\").<ref name=\"constantine_vii\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3al15wpFWiMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Constantine+VII+Porphyrogenitus+(Emperor+of+the+East)%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-eYdUs3tHcSihgfG6YHIAg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=De Administrando Imperio by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus|last=Jenkins|first=Romilly James Heald|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies|year=1967|isbn=0-88402-021-5|edition=New, revised|series=Corpus fontium historiae Byzantinae|location=Washington, D.C.|page=65|accessdate=28 August 2013}} According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, writing in his ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (ca. 950 AD) ''\"Patzinakia, the [[Pechenegs|Pecheneg realm]], stretches west as far as the [[Siret River]] (or even the [[Carpathian Mountains|Eastern Carpathian Mountains]]), and is four days distant from Tourkia (i.e. Hungary).\"''</ref><ref name=\"carterfindley\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ToAjDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT67&dq=khazar+hungary+tourkia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwikypjIuM7cAhXpNpoKHZ5BAfAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=khazar%20hungary%20tourkia&f=false|title=The Turks in World History|author=Carter Vaughn Findley|page=51|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780195177268}}</ref>{{sfn|Ba\u00e1n|1999|p=45-53}} The contemporary Byzantine name for the Hungarians was \"Turks\",<ref name=\"constantine_vii\"/><ref name=\"Howorth20082\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFc4mwsHZ7IC&pg=PA3|title=History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century: The So-called Tartars of Russia and Central Asia|author=Henry Hoyle Howorth|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-1-60520-134-4|page=3|accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"carterfindley\" /> while the Hungarian branch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], under [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]]'s jurisdiction, was named the \"[[Metropolitanate of Tourkia]]\" (Hungary), and the head of this church was the \"[[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of Tourkia\" (Hungary).{{sfn|Ba\u00e1n|1999|p=45-53}}<ref name=\"carterfindley\" /> As was customary in the hierarchy of the Byzantine state, clear differentiation is made between style of the emperors and that of the Hungarian king by using a hellenized form of the common South Slavic word for \"king\" ([[Kralj]]) for G\u00e9za. The saints and the Greek rulers have [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] while G\u00e9za does not. The inscriptions of the emperors\u2019 names are in red, while the Hungarian king's is in dark blue or black.\n\nThe enamel plaques on the circular band, the panel depicting Christ Pantokrator, and the picture of Emperor Michael were all affixed to the crown using different techniques. The picture of the emperor could not be attached to the rim in the same way as the Pantokrator picture on the front. The frame was folded upwards and the picture of the emperor was nailed to the edge. We can thus conclude that the picture of Michael VII was not originally designed for this crown, but was probably used first somewhere else.\n\nThe corona graeca with its pointed and arched plaques is identical to the form of the crowns of the Byzantine empresses{{NoteTag|missing}} \u2013 in other words it was a woman's crown. It was given by Emperor Michael Dukas VII to King G\u00e9za's wife, known only as [[Synadene]], around 1075. The gift was not a new crown, but rather an old crown designed for a woman that had to be selected from the Emperor's treasury and remodelled. The enamel pictures that become outdated were removed, since either represented earlier historical figures or were not appropriate for the Hungarian queen according to court protocol. It was in this form that the crown was sent to [[Hungary]].<br />\nThere is another view that the G\u00e9za depicted on the ''corona graeca'' is not King G\u00e9za I but [[G\u00e9za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|St Stephen's father]].<ref>A. Gallus, \"The structural aspect: towards a plural society\", Quest for a new Central Europe, ed. J. Vars\u00e1nyi, 1976, pp. 130-176, at p. 147</ref> This view is confirmed by the fact that Grand Prince G\u00e9za is depicted on the ''corona gracea'' without a crown, although carrying a royal sceptre.<ref name=\"Endrey\">\nAnthony Endrey, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=d_q3ToieMNST8gOEopD8BA&ct=result&id=ewYiAAAAMAAJ&dq=holy+crown+of+Hungary++earlier+upper+part&q=upper+part#search_anchor The Holy Crown of Hungary], Hungarian Institute, 1978, pp. 13-115</ref>\n\n===Corona Latina===\nThe \"keresztp\u00e1ntok\" (cross straps) ''corona latina'' (\"Latin Crown\") is made of four 5.2-cm-wide gold strips welded to the edge of a square central panel (7.2*7.2&nbsp;cm); the strips are usually assumed to have been originally made for some other object, and adapted for the crown. It is not an independent object, as it has no function alone. It was designed to be attached to the top rim of the ''Corona Gr\u00e6ca'' and provide a dome-shaped top.\n\nThe inscription on the pictures of the saints and the style of their lettering suggest the date when they were made. Amidst the antique-style capital letter, the T in Thomas and the second U in Paulus are formed in the style characteristic of the Latin letters used on Byzantine coins, a practice abandoned in the middle of the eleventh century. They may have decorated a reliquary box or a portable altar given to Istv\u00e1n I by the pope, or possibly the [[treasure binding]] of a book. It is also possible, although it cannot be verified, that Istv\u00e1n I received a crown as a gift from one of the popes, reciprocating his \u2013 historically documented - gifts. The picture of the apostles, however, based on their style, cannot be dated to around 1000.\n\nThe intersecting bands are edged with beaded gold wire that close off the lower end of the bands and finish off the system of decoration. There are twelve pearls on the central panel and a total of seventy-two altogether on the Corona Latina, symbolising the number of Christ's disciples, (Acts 10.1).\n\nThe central panel is decorated with a square cloisonn\u00e9 enamel picture depicting Christ Pantokrator. Each band has two (altogether eight) pictures of standing apostles identical to the first eight listed in Acts 1.13.\n\n\u00c9va Kov\u00e1cs and Zsuzsa Lovag<ref name=\"Kovacs\">''Magyar koronazasi jelvenyek'', Eva Kovacs and Zsuzsa Lovag Budapest: Corvina Kiado, 1980; ''The Hungarian crown and other regalia'' translated by Peter Balban; translated and revised by Mary and Andras Boros-Kazai, pp. 79-80</ref> suggest that the ''corona latina'' was originally a large Byzantine [[liturgical asterisk]] from a Greek monastery in Hungary.  In order to get it to fit into it new role the apostles at the bottom of each of the four arms of this asterisk were cut off before it was very crudely attached to the inside of the corona graeca to transform this Byzantine open crown into a closed crown (i.e., the type of crown proper to the ''Autocrat'', the senior emperor or monarch in Byzantine imperial protocol) and to provide a base for the reliquary cross at its summit  (see '''Cross''').\n\n===Cross===\n[[File:Matthias II of Hungary.jpg|thumb|upright|Engraving of [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias II of Hungary]], showing the cross in vertical position]]\n\nThe cross is attached to the crown in a rough manner, rising from the midriff of Christ in the central enamel plaque at the top of the crown. This addition might have been made during the 16th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The cross was knocked crooked during the 17th century when the crown was damaged, possibly by the top of the iron chest housing the insignia being hastily closed without the crown having been placed in it properly.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  The cross has since been left in this slanted position, and is now typically depicted as such.\n\n\u00c9va Kov\u00e1cs suggests that the present plain cross on the top of the crown is a replacement of an original double-barred reliquary cross containing three pieces of the [[True Cross]] and that it was the presence of the True Cross in the Holy Crown which made it holy.  She states that \u201cSzabolcs Vajay, called to my attention a strange incident in the crown\u2019s history which had completely escaped everybody\u2019s attention. Before [[Isabella Jagiellon|Queen Isabella]] handed over the regalia to [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] in 1551, she broke the cross off the crown\u2019s peak for her son, John Sigismund.  According to a contemporary Polish chronicler, John Sigismund wore this cross on his chest till the end of his life, \u201c ... because he who possess this cross will again come into possession of the missing parts which, subjected to the power of the cross, had belonged to it\".{{citequote|date = June 2015}}\n\nLater, the cross became the property of Sigismund Bathory who, persuaded by his confessor, bestowed it on Emperor Rudolf II.  This was reported by an Italian envoy in Prague who also told the Isabella-John Sigismund story.\u201d  She also notes that \u201cSeveral small fragments of the True Cross were in possession of the Arpad dynasty. As a point of interest, it is precisely the smallest ones, those set into the cross on the chest, that are attributed to St. Stephen.  About a tiny fragment of the True Cross, a Russian chronicler recording King Geza II\u2019s campaigns wrote that it had been the holy king\u2019s property and, despite its small size, it was a relic of great force.  We are, perhaps, not off the track when surmising that the Hungarian crown was holy because it had once been reinforced with a fragment of the victory-bringing relic. . . . we know quite few reliquary crowns.  To mention but the most obvious example, let us cite Charles IV\u2019s crown provided with a cross containing a thorn relic.\u201d<ref name=Kovacs/>\n\nLater, it was the Crown itself, rather than the St. Stephen's cross reliquary that came to be regarded as holy through its traditional association with St. Stephen. \u00c9va Kov\u00e1cs further notes in this regard the early use of the patriarchal or double-barred cross and crown in the ancient Hungarian royal coat of arms.  Since reliquary crosses frequently take such a double-barred form, the use of a patriarchal cross in the royal arms would be a direct reference to and representation of this royal relic. This association between the crown and this royal relic would also help to substantiate the theory that the Holy Crown was always intended to serve its historical role of legitimatizing the position of its wearer as the true divinely appointed king of Hungary.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\n===The crown as a whole===\n[[File:Ferenc J\u00f3zsef.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] crowned with the Holy Crown as Hungarian king]]\n\nThe form of the Holy Crown is identical to that of the [[kamelaukion]]-type crowns with closed tops, as introduced in the Byzantine Empire. The presence of multiple pictures is also typical of Byzantine crowns. When the intersecting bands were added to the ''corona graeca'' during the rule of B\u00e9la III, who had been brought up in Constantinople, the bands were decorated just as the ''corona graeca'' was, perhaps with the intention of imitating the Byzantine pattern.\n\n===Links to the first Hungarian king, Saint Stephen===\nBeside the using of the intersecting bands of the ''corona latina'', which probably came from the treasury of St. Istv\u00e1n, at the time of the creation of the crown there existed further expectation that the coronation insignia would eventually include additional gold works that could be linked to the first, beatified Hungarian king, Istv\u00e1n.\n\nThe inscription embroidered onto the '''coronation mantle''' indicates with all certainty that Istv\u00e1n I and Queen Gizella had it made in 1031.\n\nThe '''coronation sceptre''' with the orb at the end can also be dated to the time of St Istv\u00e1n. On the seals of [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], the rulers are holding identically shaped sceptres. Such short-staffed sceptres ending in orbs were not in use as insignia earlier or later.\n\n==The regalia in modern times==\n[[File:St stephens crown mukachevo plaque.JPG|thumb|right|Plaque at [[Mukacheve|Munk\u00e1cs]] Castle commemorating the guarding of the Crown there in 1805\u20131806]]After the fall of [[Communism]], the crown was reincorporated into the [[Coat of arms of Hungary|national coat of arms]] in 1990, the National Assembly choosing the pre-war coat of arms in preference to the crown-less [[Lajos Kossuth|Kossuth]] arms of 1849.\n[[Image:Karloath.jpg|thumb|right|King [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]], taking his coronation oath at Holy Trinity Column outside [[Matthias Church]] (1916).

During the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty]] (1000\u20131301), the coronation insignia was kept in the coronation city of [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]]. Later, the crown was housed in one of three locations: [[Visegr\u00e1d]] (in [[Pest county]]); [[Bratislava|Pozsony]] (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia); or [[Buda]]. In 1805\u20131806 the Crown was kept for about three months in the [[Palanok Castle]] at [[Mukachevo|Munk\u00e1cs]] (now Mukachevo, Ukraine). [[Lajos Kossuth]] took the crown and the coronation jewels with him after the collapse of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] and buried them in a wooden box in a willow forest, near [[Or\u015fova]] in [[Transylvania]] (Romania). They were subsequently dug up and returned to the royal castle in Buda in 1853.\n\nAt the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] the [[crown jewels]] were recovered in [[Mattsee]], Austria, on 4&nbsp;May 1945 by the [[86th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 86th Infantry Division]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/mil_hist_inst/h/hungary.asc|title=Hungary: Recovery of Crown Jewels 1945|accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref> The crown jewels were transported to Western Europe and eventually given to the [[United States Army]] by the [[Hungarian Crown Guard]] for safekeeping from the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/museum/crown.phtml|title=Jimmy Carter Library: The Crown of St. Stephen|accessdate=2016-12-12}}</ref> For much of the [[Cold War]] the crown was held at the [[United States Bullion Depository]] ([[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]]) alongside the bulk of America's gold reserves and other priceless historical items.

Old records describe the robe as handiwork of the queen and her [[sister]]s and the mantle's middle back bears the king's only known portrait (which shows his crown was not the currently existing one). A circular inscription sewn in Latin identifies the coat as a bishop's [[chasuble]].\n\nThe sceptre is considered the artistically most valuable piece of the Hungarian royal inventory.

No king of Hungary was regarded as having been truly legitimate without being crowned with it. In the [[history of Hungary]], more than fifty kings were crowned with it, up to the last, [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]], in 1916. The only kings who were not so crowned were Wladyslaw I, John II/Szapolyai J\u00e1nos Zsigmond and Joseph II. \n\nThe enamels on the crown are mainly or entirely Byzantine work, presumed to have been made in [[Constantinople]] in the 1070s. The crown was presented by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VII Doukas]] to King [[G\u00e9za I of Hungary]]; both are depicted and named in Greek on enamel plaques in the lower crown. It is one of the two known Byzantine crowns to survive, the other being the slightly earlier [[Monomachus Crown]], which is also in Budapest, in the [[Hungarian National Museum]].<ref>Beckwith, 214</ref><ref>B\u00e0r\u00e0ny-Oberschall (1949)</ref> However, the Monomachus Crown may have had another function, and the Holy Crown has probably been remodelled, and uses elements of different origins.  The date assigned to the present configuration of the Holy Crown varies, but is most commonly put around the late 12th century.<ref>L\u00e1szl\u00f3, 425</ref>  The [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|Hungarian coronation]] insignia consists of the Holy Crown, the sceptre, the orb, and the mantle. The orb has the coat-of-arms of [[Charles I of Hungary]] (1310\u20131342).  In popular tradition the Holy Crown was thought to be older, dating to the time of the first King [[Stephen I of Hungary]], crowned in 1000/1001.\n\nIt was first called the Holy Crown in 1256. During the 14th century, royal power came to be represented not simply by a crown, but by just one specific object: the Holy Crown. This also meant that the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was a special state: they were not looking for a crown to inaugurate a king, but rather, they were looking for a king for the crown; as written by Crown Guard [[P\u00e9ter R\u00e9vay]]. He also depicts that \"the Holy Crown is for the Hungarians what the [[Ark of the Covenant|Lost Ark]] is for the Jewish people\".<ref>\"De sacra corona regni Hungariae ortu, virtuti, victoria, fortuna... brevis commentarius, 1613.</ref>\n\nSince 2000, the Holy Crown has been on display in the central Domed Hall of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]].\n\n== Specifications ==\n* The Crown\u2019s shape is elliptic (the width is 203.9&nbsp;mm, the length is 215.9&nbsp;mm) and is larger than a (healthy) human head. During coronations, the king had to wear a leather 'kapa' liner, made to fit, inside the crown.\n* The weight of the Crown is 2056&nbsp;g. (4&nbsp;lb 8.52 oz)\n* The gold-silver alloys in the upper and the lower parts of the Crown differ in alloy ratio.\n* The lower part of the Crown is asymmetric.<ref>N\u00e9meth Zsolt: A magyar Szent Korona, BKL Kiad\u00f3, 2007.</ref>\n\n== Holiness doctrine ==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}\n\nAs is the case with all European Christian crowns, it symbolizes a halo and thus signifies that the wearer rules by [[Divine right of kings|Divine Right]]. According to popular tradition, [[Stephen I of Hungary|St Stephen I]] held up the crown before his death (in the year 1038) to offer it to the [[Virgin Mary]] to seal a divine contract between her and the divine crown. After this, Mary was depicted not only as ''patrona'' (patron saint) for the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] but also as ''regina'' (i.e. \"queen\"). This contract was supposed to empower the crown with divine force to help the future kings of Hungary and did help reinforce the political system based on the so-called \"Doctrine of the Holy Crown\" ({{lang-hu|Szentkorona-tan}}).\n\n[[P\u00e9ter R\u00e9vay]], a Crown Guard, expounded this doctrine in his works ''Commentarius De Sacra Regni Hungariae Corona'' (Explanation of the Holy Crown of the Kingdom of Hungary, published in [[Augsburg]], 1613) and ''De monarchia et Sacra Corona Regni Hungariae'' (About the Monarchy and the Holy Crown of Hungary, [[Frankfurt]], 1659).\nAt the core of this doctrine was the notion that the crown itself had personhood and as a legal entity is identical to the state of Hungary. It is superior to the ruling monarch, who rules \"in the name of the crown\".\n\n==Origin==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[File:Fugger Chronicle Holy Crown of Hungary.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The crown depicted in the 15th-century [[Fugger Chronicle]].

It was created during the reign of [[B\u00e9la III]] under [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] influence. (The Hungarian king B\u00e9la III was brought up in the Byzantine court and was for a period the official heir to the throne there.)\nThe [[coronation|crowning]] of Stephen I, the first king of [[Hungary]], who was later [[canonization|canonized]] Saint Stephen, marks the beginning of Hungarian statehood. The date is variously given as Christmas 1000 or 1 January 1001.\n\nOne version of the origin of the crown is written by bishop [[Hartvik]] (between 1095\u20131116), in which the \"Pope\" has sent King Stephen I \"his blessings and a crown\". The basis for this belief is a biography by bishop Hartvik written around 1100-1110 at the request of King [[K\u00f6nyves K\u00e1lm\u00e1n]]. According to \"Hartvik\u2019s legend\", St Stephen sent Archbishop [[Astrik]] of [[Esztergom]] to [[Rome]] to ask for or require (both are possible from original [[Latin]] script) a crown from the \"[[Pope]]\", but it does not tell the name of the Pope. No matter how much Astrik hurried, the [[Poland|Polish]] prince, [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]]'s envoy was quicker, and the crown was prepared for the future Polish king. The Pope had seen a dream during the night, seeing the angel of the Lord telling him there will be another envoy from another nation, asking for a crown for their own king. The angel told the Pope: \"There will be another envoy from an unknown folk, who will ask for [or require] a crown, too, please give the crown to them, as they deserve it\". The next day Astrik approached the Pope so he gave the crown to him. \"Hartvik\u2019s legend\" appeared in the [[liturgical book]]s and breviaries in Hungary around 1200, recalling the then-existing Pope, [[Pope Sylvester II]].\n\nConsequently, the story of how the crown had been sent by Pope Sylvester II spread throughout the Christian world, so in 1613, crown guard P\u00e9ter R\u00e9vay states that the entire crown was given to St Stephen by [[Pope Sylvester II]]. However, this legend can be considered a myth, as Mieszko I was not living at the same time as either St. Stephen I or Pope Sylvester II. Also, in the \"Greater Legend\" of St Stephen, written around the time he was canonised (1083), we learn only that \"in the fifth year after the death of his father (...) they brought a Papal letter of blessings (...) and the Lord\u2019s favoured one, Stephen, was chosen to be king, and was anointed with oil and fortunately crowned with the diadem of royal honour\". This legend clearly lacks the information that the crown was from Rome. Moreover, there are no documents found in [[Vatican City]] on the granting of the crown, even though the Vatican has a clear interest in handing over the crown from Rome, as it is representing dominance over the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\nThere is another version on the origin of Holy Crown, which is a popular fallacy: Thietmar von Merseburg (died in 1018) reports that [[Otto III]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] has consented to the coronation of St. Stephen, and the Pope is sending his blessings; so many historians argued he has also sent a crown, however, does not report on any crown, so it cannot follow any fact.\n\nBeside the two main theories \u2013 donation by the pope and creation in the time of B\u00e9la III \u2013 there exist a number of different theories of the more romantic kind, putting the origin of the crown into the far past and into Asia.\n\nThe question to what extent the upper part of the Holy Crown indeed belonged to the crown of King Stephen I remained open until 1978, when the coronation insignia was returned to Hungary and a thorough examination could be carried out.\n\nThe differing styles and techniques used in making the enamel pictures and the fact that the inscriptions on the diadem are in Greek and on the bands in Latin suggest that the two parts were probably made in two different periods. However, we have to note that there are no known representations of any kind in which the crown is separated: the Holy Crown is always shown as one.\n\n==Type==\nThe Crown is a [[coronation crown]], which should be worn only on the occasion of a coronation, and for the rest of the time two crown guards (korona\u0151r) guard it. Apart from this, there are only two other people who can touch it, the ''[[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|n\u00e1dorisp\u00e1n]]'' (the highest secular title), who puts it onto a pillow during the coronation, and the [[Archdiocese of Esztergom|Archbishop of Esztergom]] ([[primate (bishop)|primate]] of Hungary, the highest ecclesiastical title), who places it on the head of the king.\n\n==Structure of the crown and its icons==\n[[File:SztKoronaEN.jpg|thumb|360px|Sketch of the enamel icons of the Saints on the Holy Crown (top view, the crown's front side is on the bottom of the image)]]\nThe Holy Crown was made of gold and decorated with nineteen enamel \"pantokrator\" picture (pantokrator is a Greek word meaning \"the master of the universe\") as well as semi-precious stones, genuine pearls, and [[almandine]]. It has three parts: \"abroncs\" (rim, hoop) (''corona graeca''),  \"keresztp\u00e1ntok\" (cross straps) (''corona latina''), and the cross on the top, which is today crooked.\n\nThere are four hanging pendants ([[pendilia]]) dangling from chains on each side of the diadem and one in the back.\n\n===Corona graeca===\nThe \"abroncs\" (rim, hoop) ''corona graeca'' (\"Greek Crown\") is 5.2&nbsp;cm wide with a diameter of 20.5&nbsp;cm.\n\nThe two aquamarine stones with cut surfaces on the back of the diadem were added as replacements by [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|King Matthias II]] (1608\u20131619). The enamel picture on the front depicts [[Christ Pantokrator]]. On the rim to the right and left of Jesus are pictures of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]], followed by half-length images of the Saints [[Saint George|George]] and [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Demetrius]], and [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas and Damian]].\n\n[[File:Michael VII Doukas on the Holy Crown.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VII Doukas]] on the ''corona graeca'' of the Holy Crown of Hungary]]\n[[File:G\u00e9za I.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hungarian King [[G\u00e9za I of Hungary|G\u00e9za I]] on the ''corona graeca'' of the Holy Crown of Hungary]]\n\nIn the arched frame on the back of the diadem [[Michael VII Doukas|Emperor Michael VII Doukas]] (1071\u20131078) is depicted.

To the right there is a picture of the Hungarian King [[G\u00e9za I]] (1074\u20131077), with the [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription: \"\u0393\u0395\u03a9\u0392\u0399\u03a4\u0396\u0391\u03f9 \u03a0\u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u03f9 \u039a\u03a1\u0391\u039b\u0397\u03f9 \u03a4\u039f\u03a5\u03a1\u039a\u0399\u0391\u03f9\" (''Ge\u014dbitzas pist\u00f3s kr\u00e1l\u0113s Tourk\u00edas'', meaning \"[[G\u00e9za I]], faithful [[kralj]] of the [[Hungary|land of the Turks]]\").<ref name=\"constantine_vii\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3al15wpFWiMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Constantine+VII+Porphyrogenitus+(Emperor+of+the+East)%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-eYdUs3tHcSihgfG6YHIAg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=De Administrando Imperio by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus|last=Jenkins|first=Romilly James Heald|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies|year=1967|isbn=0-88402-021-5|edition=New, revised|series=Corpus fontium historiae Byzantinae|location=Washington, D.C.|page=65|accessdate=28 August 2013}} According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, writing in his ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (ca. 950 AD) ''\"Patzinakia, the [[Pechenegs|Pecheneg realm]], stretches west as far as the [[Siret River]] (or even the [[Carpathian Mountains|Eastern Carpathian Mountains]]), and is four days distant from Tourkia (i.e. Hungary).\"''</ref><ref name=\"carterfindley\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ToAjDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT67&dq=khazar+hungary+tourkia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwikypjIuM7cAhXpNpoKHZ5BAfAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=khazar%20hungary%20tourkia&f=false|title=The Turks in World History|author=Carter Vaughn Findley|page=51|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780195177268}}</ref>{{sfn|Ba\u00e1n|1999|p=45-53}} The contemporary Byzantine name for the Hungarians was \"Turks\",<ref name=\"constantine_vii\"/><ref name=\"Howorth20082\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFc4mwsHZ7IC&pg=PA3|title=History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century: The So-called Tartars of Russia and Central Asia|author=Henry Hoyle Howorth|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-1-60520-134-4|page=3|accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"carterfindley\" /> while the Hungarian branch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], under [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]]'s jurisdiction, was named the \"[[Metropolitanate of Tourkia]]\" (Hungary), and the head of this church was the \"[[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of Tourkia\" (Hungary).{{sfn|Ba\u00e1n|1999|p=45-53}}<ref name=\"carterfindley\" /> As was customary in the hierarchy of the Byzantine state, clear differentiation is made between style of the emperors and that of the Hungarian king by using a hellenized form of the common South Slavic word for \"king\" ([[Kralj]]) for G\u00e9za. The saints and the Greek rulers have [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] while G\u00e9za does not. The inscriptions of the emperors\u2019 names are in red, while the Hungarian king\u2019s is in dark blue or black.\n\nThe enamel plaques on the circular band, the panel depicting Christ Pantokrator, and the picture of Emperor Michael were all affixed to the crown using different techniques. The picture of the emperor could not be attached to the rim in the same way as the Pantokrator picture on the front. The frame was folded upwards and the picture of the emperor was nailed to the edge. We can thus conclude that the picture of Michael VII was not originally designed for this crown, but was probably used first somewhere else.\n\nThe corona graeca with its pointed and arched plaques is identical to the form of the crowns of the Byzantine empresses{{NoteTag|missing}} \u2013 in other words it was a woman\u2019s crown. It was given by Emperor Michael Dukas VII to King G\u00e9za\u2019s wife, known only as [[Synadene]], around 1075. The gift was not a new crown, but rather an old crown designed for a woman that had to be selected from the Emperor\u2019s treasury and remodelled. The enamel pictures that become outdated were removed, since either represented earlier historical figures or were not appropriate for the Hungarian queen according to court protocol. It was in this form that the crown was sent to [[Hungary]].<br />\nThere is another view that the G\u00e9za depicted on the ''corona graeca'' is not King G\u00e9za I but [[G\u00e9za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|St Stephen's father]].<ref>A.

It is not an independent object, as it has no function alone. It was designed to be attached to the top rim of the ''Corona Gr\u00e6ca'' and provide a dome-shaped top.\n\nThe inscription on the pictures of the saints and the style of their lettering suggest the date when they were made. Amidst the antique-style capital letter, the T in Thomas and the second U in Paulus are formed in the style characteristic of the Latin letters used on Byzantine coins, a practice abandoned in the middle of the eleventh century. They may have decorated a reliquary box or a portable altar given to Istv\u00e1n I by the pope, or possibly the [[treasure binding]] of a book. It is also possible, although it cannot be verified, that Istv\u00e1n I received a crown as a gift from one of the popes, reciprocating his \u2013 historically documented - gifts. The picture of the apostles, however, based on their style, cannot be dated to around 1000.\n\nThe intersecting bands are edged with beaded gold wire that close off the lower end of the bands and finish off the system of decoration. There are twelve pearls on the central panel and a total of seventy-two altogether on the Corona Latina, symbolising the number of Christ\u2019s disciples, (Acts 10.1).\n\nThe central panel is decorated with a square cloisonn\u00e9 enamel picture depicting Christ Pantokrator. Each band has two (altogether eight) pictures of standing apostles identical to the first eight listed in Acts 1.13.\n\n\u00c9va Kov\u00e1cs and Zsuzsa Lovag<ref name=\"Kovacs\">''Magyar koronazasi jelvenyek'', Eva Kovacs and Zsuzsa Lovag Budapest: Corvina Kiado, 1980; ''The Hungarian crown and other regalia'' translated by Peter Balban; translated and revised by Mary and Andras Boros-Kazai, pp. 79-80</ref> suggest that the ''corona latina'' was originally a large Byzantine [[liturgical asterisk]] from a Greek monastery in Hungary.  In order to get it to fit into it new role the apostles at the bottom of each of the four arms of this asterisk were cut off before it was very crudely attached to the inside of the corona graeca to transform this Byzantine open crown into a closed crown (i.e., the type of crown proper to the ''Autocrat'', the senior emperor or monarch in Byzantine imperial protocol) and to provide a base for the reliquary cross at its summit  (see '''Cross''').\n\n===Cross===\n[[File:Matthias II of Hungary.jpg|thumb|upright|Engraving of [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias II of Hungary]], showing the cross in vertical position]]\n\nThe cross is attached to the crown in a rough manner, rising from the midriff of Christ in the central enamel plaque at the top of the crown. This addition might have been made during the 16th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The cross was knocked crooked during the 17th century when the crown was damaged, possibly by the top of the iron chest housing the insignia being hastily closed without the crown having been placed in it properly.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  The cross has since been left in this slanted position, and is now typically depicted as such.\n\n\u00c9va Kov\u00e1cs suggests that the present plain cross on the top of the crown is a replacement of an original double-barred reliquary cross containing three pieces of the [[True Cross]] and that it was the presence of the True Cross in the Holy Crown which made it holy.  She states that \u201cSzabolcs Vajay, called to my attention a strange incident in the crown\u2019s history which had completely escaped everybody\u2019s attention. Before [[Isabella Jagiellon|Queen Isabella]] handed over the regalia to [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] in 1551, she broke the cross off the crown\u2019s peak for her son, John Sigismund.  According to a contemporary Polish chronicler, John Sigismund wore this cross on his chest till the end of his life, \u201c ... because he who possess this cross will again come into possession of the missing parts which, subjected to the power of the cross, had belonged to it\".{{citequote|date = June 2015}}\n\nLater, the cross became the property of Sigismund Bathory who, persuaded by his confessor, bestowed it on Emperor Rudolf II.  This was reported by an Italian envoy in Prague who also told the Isabella-John Sigismund story.\u201d  She also notes that \u201cSeveral small fragments of the True Cross were in possession of the Arpad dynasty. As a point of interest, it is precisely the smallest ones, those set into the cross on the chest, that are attributed to St. Stephen.  About a tiny fragment of the True Cross, a Russian chronicler recording King Geza II\u2019s campaigns wrote that it had been the holy king\u2019s property and, despite its small size, it was a relic of great force.  We are, perhaps, not off the track when surmising that the Hungarian crown was holy because it had once been reinforced with a fragment of the victory-bringing relic. . . . we know quite few reliquary crowns.  To mention but the most obvious example, let us cite Charles IV\u2019s crown provided with a cross containing a thorn relic.\u201d<ref name=Kovacs/>\n\nLater, it was the Crown itself, rather than the St. Stephen's cross reliquary that came to be regarded as holy through its traditional association with St. Stephen. \u00c9va Kov\u00e1cs further notes in this regard the early use of the patriarchal or double-barred cross and crown in the ancient Hungarian royal coat of arms.  Since reliquary crosses frequently take such a double-barred form, the use of a patriarchal cross in the royal arms would be a direct reference to and representation of this royal relic. This association between the crown and this royal relic would also help to substantiate the theory that the Holy Crown was always intended to serve its historical role of legitimatizing the position of its wearer as the true divinely appointed king of Hungary.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\n===The crown as a whole===\n[[File:Ferenc J\u00f3zsef.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] crowned with the Holy Crown as Hungarian king]]\n\nThe form of the Holy Crown is identical to that of the [[kamelaukion]]-type crowns with closed tops, as introduced in the Byzantine Empire. The presence of multiple pictures is also typical of Byzantine crowns. When the intersecting bands were added to the ''corona graeca'' during the rule of B\u00e9la III, who had been brought up in Constantinople, the bands were decorated just as the ''corona graeca'' was, perhaps with the intention of imitating the Byzantine pattern.\n\n===Links to the first Hungarian king, Saint Stephen===\nBeside the using of the intersecting bands of the ''corona latina'', which probably came from the treasury of St. Istv\u00e1n, at the time of the creation of the crown there existed further expectation that the coronation insignia would eventually include additional gold works that could be linked to the first, beatified Hungarian king, Istv\u00e1n.\n\nThe inscription embroidered onto the '''coronation mantle''' indicates with all certainty that Istv\u00e1n I and Queen Gizella had it made in 1031.\n\nThe '''coronation sceptre''' with the orb at the end can also be dated to the time of St Istv\u00e1n. On the seals of [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], the rulers are holding identically shaped sceptres. Such short-staffed sceptres ending in orbs were not in use as insignia earlier or later.\n\n==The regalia in modern times==\n[[File:St stephens crown mukachevo plaque.JPG|thumb|right|Plaque at [[Mukacheve|Munk\u00e1cs]] Castle commemorating the guarding of the Crown there in 1805\u20131806]]After the fall of [[Communism]], the crown was reincorporated into the [[Coat of arms of Hungary|national coat of arms]] in 1990, the National Assembly choosing the pre-war coat of arms in preference to the crown-less [[Lajos Kossuth|Kossuth]] arms of 1849.\n[[Image:Karloath.jpg|thumb|right|King [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]], taking his coronation oath at Holy Trinity Column outside [[Matthias Church]] (1916).

During the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty]] (1000\u20131301), the coronation insignia was kept in the coronation city of [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]]. Later, the crown was housed in one of three locations: [[Visegr\u00e1d]] (in [[Pest county]]); [[Bratislava|Pozsony]] (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia); or [[Buda]]. In 1805\u20131806 the Crown was kept for about three months in the [[Palanok Castle]] at [[Mukachevo|Munk\u00e1cs]] (now Mukachevo, Ukraine). [[Lajos Kossuth]] took the crown and the coronation jewels with him after the collapse of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] and buried them in a wooden box in a willow forest, near [[Or\u015fova]] in [[Transylvania]] (Romania). They were subsequently dug up and returned to the royal castle in Buda in 1853.\n\nAt the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] the [[crown jewels]] were recovered in [[Mattsee]], Austria, on 4&nbsp;May 1945 by the [[86th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 86th Infantry Division]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/mil_hist_inst/h/hungary.asc|title=Hungary: Recovery of Crown Jewels 1945|accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref> The crown jewels were transported to Western Europe and eventually given to the [[United States Army]] by the [[Hungarian Crown Guard]] for safekeeping from the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/museum/crown.phtml|title=Jimmy Carter Library: The Crown of St. Stephen|accessdate=2016-12-12}}</ref> For much of the [[Cold War]] the crown was held at the [[United States Bullion Depository]] ([[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]]) alongside the bulk of America's gold reserves and other priceless historical items. After undergoing extensive historical research to verify the crown as genuine, it was returned to Hungary by order of U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] on 6&nbsp;January 1978. Most current academic knowledge about Hungarian royal garments originates from this modern research. Following substantial U.S. political debate, the agreement to return the jewels contained many conditions to ensure the people of Hungary, rather than its Communist government, took possession of the jewels.<ref name='The Gulya Pot'>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegulyaspot.com/site/?q=node/148 |title=The Hungarian Crown |accessdate=2009-08-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220123521/http://www.thegulyaspot.com/site/?q=node%2F148 |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |df= }}</ref> The majority of the Hungarian-American population opposed the decision to return the crown.<ref>{{cite news |title=Returning the Crown of Saint Stephen to post-Cold War Hungary |url=https://adst.org/2014/12/a-crown-for-hungary/ |accessdate=7 January 2020 |work=Association for Diplomatic Studies & Training |date=December 29, 2014}}</ref> On January 6, 1978, US Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]] returned the Crown to Hungary in Budapest.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hofmann |first1=Paul |title=Crown of St.Stephen Formally Returned to Hungary |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/07/archives/crown-of-st-stephen-formally-returned-to-hungary-emotion-was.html |accessdate=7 January 2020 |work=United Press International |publisher=The New York Times |date=January 7, 1978}}</ref>\n\n==Other coronation regalia==\n<gallery>\nFile:Portrayal of Stephen I, King of Hungary on the coronation pall.jpg|Portrayal of Stephen I on the Hungarian coronation pall from 1031\nFile:Crown, Sword and Globus Cruciger of Hungary2.jpg|The Crown, Sword, Sceptre and [[Globus Cruciger]] of Hungary, in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]]\nFile:HUF 2000 2000 obverse.jpg|The Holy Crown on the commemorative 2000 [[Hungarian forint|HUF]] banknote, issued in 2000, the millennium anniversary of the coronation of [[King Saint Stephen]]\n\n</gallery>\nUniquely in Europe, most of the medieval ensemble of [[coronation regalia]] has survived. On 1&nbsp;January 2000, the Holy Crown of Hungary was moved to the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] from the [[Hungarian National Museum]]. The [[sceptre]], [[globus cruciger|orb]] and the coronation sword were also moved to the Parliament.\n\nThe very large [[coronation]] [[Mantle (royal garment)|mantle]] remains in a glass [[Inert gas#Applications|inert gas vault]] at the National Museum due to its delicate, faint condition. Unlike the crown and accompanying insignia, the originally red coloured mantle is considered to date back to Stephen I, and was made circa 1030. Old records describe the robe as handiwork of the queen and her [[sister]]s and the mantle's middle back bears the king's only known portrait (which shows his crown was not the currently existing one). A circular inscription sewn in Latin identifies the coat as a bishop's [[chasuble]].\n\nThe sceptre is considered the artistically most valuable piece of the Hungarian royal inventory. It contains a solid [[quartz|rock crystal]] ball decorated with engraved lions, a rare product of the 10th-century [[Fatimid]] caliphate. Its handle contains a wooden rod surrounded by very fine wrought silver ornaments.\n\nThe ceremonial straight sword kept in the Holy Crown collection is a 14th-century Italian product.
