She is known as the [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] of [[Oscar I of Sweden]] in circa 1819-1827.\n\nJaquette was the daughter of [[Major General]] Nils Wexionius, 5th Count Gyldenstolpe (1768-1844), and the [[Salon (gathering)|salonist]] [[Charlotta Aurora De Geer]].\n\nJaquette Gyldenstolpe served as maid of honor to the queen, [[Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp]] prior to her marriage.  On 18 September 1817, she married [[Lieutenant General]] Count [[Carl Gustaf L\u00f6wenhielm]] and moved with him to his estate in [[V\u00e4rmland]].    The marriage was childless.  Jaquette did not like the role of mistress at a country estate, and missed life at court.    They moved back to the city when her spouse was appointed chamberlain to the Crown Prince in 1818.  At the royal court, Jaquette became a center of the circle around the Crown Prince, alongside her mother, [[Gustaf Lagebjelke]], [[Mariana Koskull]] and the wife of the Dutch ambassador, who amused themselves with masquerades and French language amateur theater at [[Rosersberg Palace]].    Jaquette and Oscar were pointed out as lovers in many private letters of the time.

Jaquette bore a daughter by the name of Oscara, who has been pointed out as the daughter of Oscar.  The baby was given up to burgher-class foster-parents, and was given their last name.

Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain [[subplot]]s that do not specifically relate to the main characters' romantic love. Furthermore, a romance novel must have an \"emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\"\n\nOthers, including Leslie Gelbman, a president of [[Berkley Books]], define the genre more simply, stating only that a romance must make the \"romantic relationship between the hero and the heroine ... the core of the book.\"<ref name=\"whatsinaname\">{{Cite news|title=What's in a Name? |newspaper=Publishers Weekly |date=July 2, 2001 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/index.asp?layout=article&articleId=CA91257&display=searchResults |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212184432/http://www.publishersweekly.com/index.asp?layout=article |archivedate=February 12, 2008 }}</ref> In general, romance novels reward characters who are good people and penalize those who are evil, and a couple who fights for and believes in their relationship will likely be rewarded with unconditional love.<ref name=\"rwadefn\" /> Bestselling author [[Nora Roberts]] sums up the genre, saying: \"The books are about the celebration of falling in love and emotion and commitment, and all of those things we really want.\"<ref name=\"gray\" /> [[Women's fiction]] (including \"[[chick lit]]\") is not directly a subcategory of the romance novel genre, because in women's fiction the heroine's relationship with her family or friends may be as important as her relationship with the hero.<ref name=\"whatsinaname\" />\n\nSome romance novel authors and readers believe the genre has additional restrictions, from plot considerations (such as the [[protagonists]]' meeting early on in the story), to avoiding themes (such as [[adultery]]). Other disagreements have centered on the firm requirement for a happy ending; some readers admit stories without a happy ending, if the focus of the story is on the [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] between the two main characters (e.g., ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''). While the majority of romance novels meet the stricter criteria, there are also many books widely considered to be romance novels that deviate from these rules.

''Pamela'' was the first popular novel to be based on a courtship as told from the perspective of the heroine. Unlike many of the novels of the time, ''Pamela'' had a happy ending, when after Mr. B attempts unsuccessfully to seduce and rape Pamela multiple times, he eventually rewards her virtue by sincerely proposing an equitable marriage to her.

In 1919, [[E.M. Hull]]'s novel ''[[The Sheik (novel)|The Sheik]]'' was published in the [[United Kingdom]]. The novel, which became hugely popular, was adapted into a [[The Sheik (film)|movie]] (1921), which established star [[Rudolph Valentino]] as the top male actor of the time. The hero of this book was an iconic [[alpha male]] who kidnapped the heroine and won her admiration through his forceful actions. The novel was one of the first modern works to introduce the [[rape fantasy]], a theme explored in Samuel Richardson's ''Pamela'' (1740). Although women were gaining more independence in life, publishers believed that readers would only accept premarital sex in the context of rape. In this novel and those that followed, the rape was depicted as more of a fantasy; the heroine is rarely if ever shown experiencing terror, stress, or trauma as a result.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 115\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe popular, mass market version of the [[historical novel|historical romance]], which [[Walter Scott]] developed in the early 19th century, is seen as beginning in 1921, when [[Georgette Heyer]] published ''The Black Moth''. This is set in 1751, but many of Heyer's novels were inspired by Jane Austen's novels and are set around the time Austen lived, in the later [[Regency period]]. Because Heyer's romances are set more than 100 years earlier, she includes carefully researched historical detail to help her readers understand the period.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 125-126.</ref> Unlike other popular love-romance novels of the time, Heyer's novels used the setting as a major plot device. Her characters often exhibit twentieth century sensibilities, and more conventional characters in the novels point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love.<ref>Regis (2003), p. 127.</ref> Heyer was a prolific author, and wrote one to two historical romance novels per year until her death in 1974.<ref>Regis (2003), p 125.</ref>\n\n===Rise of the category romance===\nIn the 1930s, the British publishers [[Mills & Boon]] began releasing hardback romance novels. The books were sold through weekly two-penny libraries and were known as \"the books in brown\" for their brown binding. In the 1950s, the company began offering the books for sale through newsagents across the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"mandb\">{{cite web|title=Mills & Boon - Our History|url=http://www.millsandboon.co.uk/cgi-bin/millsandboon.filereader?461262c700a12d24273f58d0dc9e068f+EN/catalogs/1124|publisher=Harlequin Mills and Boon|accessdate=July 19, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013164823/http://millsandboon.co.uk/cgi-bin/millsandboon.filereader?461262c700a12d24273f58d0dc9e068f+EN%2Fcatalogs%2F1124|archivedate=October 13, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nA Canadian company, [[Harlequin Enterprises]], began distributing in North America in 1957 the category romances published by Mills & Boon.<ref name=\"Thurston 1987, p. 42\">Thurston (1987), p. 42.</ref> Mary Bonneycastle, wife of Harlequin founder Richard Bonneycastle, and her daughter, Judy Burgess, exercised editorial control over which Mills & Boon novels Harlequin reprinted. They had a \"decency code,\" and rejected more sexually explicit material that Mills and Boon submitted for reprinting. Realizing that the genre was popular, Richard Bonneycastle finally decided to read a romance novel. He chose one of the more explicit novels and enjoyed it. On his orders, the company conducted a market test with the novel he had read and discovered that it outsold a similar, tamer novel.<ref>Regis (2003), p. 185</ref> Overall, the novels were short and formulaic, featuring heroines who were sweet, compassionate, pure and innocent. The few heroines who worked did so in traditional female jobs, including as [[nurse]]s, [[governess]]es and [[secretary|secretaries]]. Intimacy in the novels never extended beyond a chaste kiss between the protagonists.<ref name=\"Thurston 1987, p. 42\"/>\n\nOn October 1, 1971, Harlequin purchased Mills & Boon. By this point, the romance novel genre \"had been popularized and distributed widely to an enthusiastic audience\" in [[Great Britain]]. In an attempt to duplicate Mills & Boon's success in North America, Harlequin improved their distribution and marketing system.<ref name=\"Regis 2003, p. 156\">Regis (2003), p. 156.</ref> By choosing to sell their books \"where the women are,\" they allowed many mass-market merchandisers and even supermarkets to sell the books, all of which were exactly 192 pages. Harlequin then began a reader service, selling directly to readers who agreed to purchase a certain number of books each month.<ref>Thurston, pp. 46-47.</ref>\n\n===<span id=\"Birth of modern romance\"></span>The beginnings of American romance fiction===\nIn the US, modern romance genre fiction was born in 1972, with [[Avon Books|Avon's]] publication of [[Kathleen Woodiwiss]]'s ''[[The Flame and the Flower]]'', which was the first of the modern \"bodice ripper\" romance novels to follow \"the principals into the bedroom.\"<ref name=\"athitakis\">{{Cite news   | last = Athitakis  | first = Mark  | title = A Romance Glossary  | newspaper = SF Weekly  | date = July 25, 2001  | url =http://www.sfweekly.com/2001-07-25/news/a-romance-glossary/  | accessdate = April 23, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"zaitchik\"/> Aside from its content, the book was revolutionary in that it was one of the first single-title romance novels to be published as an original [[paperback]], rather than being first published in [[hardcover]], and, like the category romances, was distributed in drug stores and other mass-market merchandising outlets.<ref name=\"thurston4748\"/> The novel went on to sell 2.35&nbsp;million copies.<ref name=\"darrach\">{{Cite news  | last =Darrach  | first =Brad  | title = Rosemary's Babies    | newspaper = Time| date = January 17, 1977    | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918604-2,00.html|accessdate=July 17, 2007}}</ref> Avon followed its release with the 1974 publication of Woodiwiss's second novel, ''The Wolf and the Dove'' and two more sexually graphic novels by newcomer [[Rosemary Rogers]], ''Sweet Savage Love'' and ''Dark Fires''. The latter sold two million copies in its first three months of release. By 1975, ''Publishers Weekly'' had reported that the \"Avon originals\" had sold a combined {{nowrap|8 million copies}}.<ref name=\"thurston4748\">Thurston, pp 47-48.</ref> The following year over 150 historical romance novels, many of them paperback originals, were published, selling over {{nowrap|40 million copies}}.<ref name=\"darrach\"/>\n\nThe success of these novels prompted a new style of writing romance, concentrating primarily on historical fiction tracking the monogamous relationship between a helpless heroine and the hero who rescued her, even if he had been the one to place her in danger.<ref name=\"whitepamela\">{{Cite news  | last = White  | first = Pamela  | title = Romancing Society  | newspaper = Boulder Weekly  | date = August 15, 2002  | url = http://www.boulderweekly.com/archive/081502/coverstory.html  | accessdate = April 23, 2007  | url-status = dead  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070904133155/http://www.boulderweekly.com/archive/081502/coverstory.html  | archivedate = September 4, 2007  | df = mdy-all  }}</ref> The covers of these novels tended to feature scantily clad women being grabbed by the hero, and caused the novels to be referred to as '''bodice rippers'''.<ref name=\"athitakis\"/> A ''[[Wall St. Journal]]'' article in 1980 referred to these bodice rippers as \"publishing's answer to the Big Mac: They are juicy, cheap, predictable, and devoured in stupefying quantities by legions of loyal fans.\"<ref>Thurston, p 67.</ref> The term ''bodice ripper'' is now considered offensive to many in the romance industry.<ref name=\"athitakis\"/>\n\nIn this new style of historical romance, heroines were independent and strong-willed and were often paired with heroes who evolved into caring and compassionate men who truly admired the women they loved.<ref>Thurston, p 72.</ref> This was in contrast to the contemporary romances published during this time, which were often characterized by weak females who fell in love with overbearing [[alpha male]]s.<ref name=\"grossman\"/> Although these heroines had active roles in the plot, they were \"passive in relationships with the heroes.\"<ref name=\"crusie\"/> Across the genre, heroines during this time were usually aged 16\u201321, with the heroes slightly older, usually around 30. The women were [[virgins]], while the men were not, and both members of the couple were described as beautiful.<ref>Thurston, p 75.</ref>\n\n===Category romance adapts===\nCategory romance lines were slower to react to some of the changes that had swept the historical romance subgenre. Despite the fact that the former Mills & Boon lines were now owned by a [[North America]]n company, the lines did not have any American writers until 1975, when Harlequin purchased a novel by [[Janet Dailey]].<ref>Thurston (1987), pp. 46-47.</ref><ref>Regis (2003), pp. 155\u2013156</ref> Dailey's novels provided the romance genre's \"first look at heroines, heroes and courtships that take place in America, with American sensibilities, assumptions, history, and most of all, settings.\"<ref>Regis (2003), p. 159.</ref> Harlequin was unsure how the market would react to this new type of romance, and was unwilling to fully embrace it. In the late 1970s, a Harlequin editor rejected a manuscript by [[Nora Roberts]], who has since become the top-selling romance author, because \"they already had their American writer.\"<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 158, 183, 184.</ref>\n\nHarlequin sold almost $70&nbsp;million of its paperback romances in 1979 through 100,000 supermarkets and other stores, giving the company almost 10% of the market for paperback books. That year the company began distributing its own books in the United States instead of through [[Simon & Schuster]]'s [[Pocket Books]]. In 1980 Simon & Schuster formed Silhouette Books to publish its own romance novels, beginning what ''The New York Times'' called \"perhaps the most bitter war in American book publishing history.\"<ref name=\"walters19801012\">{{cite news | title=Paperback Talk | work=The New York Times | date=October 12, 1980 | author=Walters, Ray | pages=A47}}</ref> The company sought to take advantage of the untapped talent of the American writers.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 156, 159.</ref> They published several lines of category romance, and encouraged their writers to create stronger heroines and less dominant heroes. Authors were also expected to address contemporary issues where appropriate.<ref>Regis (2003), p. 184</ref> Silhouette soon saw their market share expand, and in 1984, Harlequin acquired them. Despite the acquisition, Silhouette continued to retain editorial control and to publish various lines under their own imprint.<ref name=\"Regis 2003, p. 156\"/>\n\nHarlequin had also failed to adapt quickly to the signs that readers appreciated novels with more explicit sex scenes, and in 1980, several publishers entered the category romance market to fill that gap. That year, Dell launched their Candlelight Ecstasy line with [[Amii Lorin]]'s ''The Tawny Gold Man'', becoming the first line to waive the requirement that heroines be virgins. By the end of 1983 sales for the Candlelight Ecstasy line totaled $30&nbsp;million. Silhoeutte also launched similar lines, Desire (sexually explicit) and Special Edition (sexually explicit and longer stories, up to 250 pages), each of which had a 90\u2013100% sellout rate each month.<ref name=\"barret\">{{Cite news  | last =Barrett  | first =Mary Ellin  | title =Pure as the Driven Slush  | newspaper =Family Weekly  | date =January 9, 1983  | url =http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%203.pdf  | format =PDF  | accessdate =May 24, 2007  | url-status =dead  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004649/http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%203.pdf  | archivedate =September 27, 2007  | df =mdy-all  }}</ref>\n\nA 1982 survey of romance readers confirmed that the new styles of writing were attracting new readers to the genre. 35% of the readers surveyed had begun reading romances after 1977. An additional 31% of those surveyed had been readers for between 6 and 10 years, meaning they had become interested in the genre after 1972, when Woodiwiss's revolutionary novel was published. This means that two-thirds of those surveyed joined the genre after it had begun to change.<ref>Thurston, pp. 127-128.</ref>\n\nThe number of category romance lines increased at a rapid pace, and by 1985 there were 16 separate lines producing a total of 80 novels per month.<ref>Regis (2003), p. 157.</ref> The sudden increase in category romance lines meant an equally sudden increase in demand for writers of the new style of romance novel. This tight market caused a proportionate decrease in the quality of the novels that were being released. By 1984, the market was saturated with category lines and readers had begun to complain of redundancy in plots.<ref>Thurston, p 188.</ref> The following year, the \"dampening effect of the high level of redundancy associated with series romances was evident in the decreased number of titles being read per month.\"<ref>Thurston, p 128.</ref> Harlequin's return rate, which had been less than 25% in 1978, when it was the primary provider of category romance, swelled to 60%.<ref>Thurston, p 190.</ref>\n\n===Further change===\nThe genre continued to expand in the mid-to-late 1980s, as publishers realized that the more popular authors were often those who stretched the boundaries of the genre.

The age range of heroines also began to expand, so that books began to feature women who had already reached 30 and even 40. Heroes also changed, with some authors veering towards a more sensitive man.

Some authors prefer to write several interconnected books, ranging in number from trilogies to long-running series, so that they can revisit characters or worlds.

Subgenres of romance are often closely related to other literature genres, and some books could be considered a romance subgenre novel and another genre novel at the same time. For example, romantic suspense novels are often similar to [[detective fiction|mysteries]], [[crime fiction]] and [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]s, and [[paranormal romance]]s use elements popular in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] novels.\n\n===Contemporary romance===\n{{Main|Contemporary romance}}\nContemporary romance, which is set after [[World War II]],<ref name=\"rwasub\">{{cite web | title = Romance Literature Subgenres | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]] | url = http://www.rwanational.org/cs/romance_literature_subgenres | accessdate = July 23, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100727064017/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/romance_literature_subgenres | archive-date = July 27, 2010 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> is often what people mean when they refer to a romance novel.

However, the focus here is on the [[mass-market]] genre.\n\nThis subgenre includes a wide variety of other subgenres, including [[Regency romance]]. Mass-market historical romance novels are rarely published in hardcover, with fewer than 15 receiving that status each year, less than one-fifth of the number of contemporary romance novels published in that format. Because historical romances are primarily published in mass-market format, their fortunes are tied to a certain extent to the mass-market trends. Booksellers and large merchandisers now sell fewer mass market paperbacks, preferring trade paperbacks or hardcovers, which prevents historical romances from being sold in some price clubs and other mass merchandise outlets.<ref name=\"dyer\"/>\n\nIn 2001, 778 mass-market historical romances were published, a 10-year high. By 2004, the annual number had dropped to 486, which was still 20% of all romance novels published.

Sometimes the larger culture is aware of the magical in its midst; sometimes it is not. Some paranormal romances focus less on the specifics of their [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate worlds]] than do traditional science fiction or fantasy novels, keeping the attention strongly on the underlying romance.<ref name=\"marble\"/> Others develop the [[Alternative universe (fan fiction)|alternate reality]] meticulously, combining well-planned magical systems and inhuman cultures with contemporary reality.\n\n===Science fiction romance===\nThese books (time travel, fantasy, science fiction, and futuristic) blend romance with fantasy or science fiction, and they often overlap the paranormal subgenre. While exploring their alternate worlds, they also offer a fully developed romance. The sensuality level in these novels varies from chaste to very sexy.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grant|2007|p=230}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, many publishers have included futuristic, fantasy, and science-fiction romances in their contemporary series lines (for example, Harlequin Temptation, Harlequin Superromance, Silhouette Special Edition). Today these romances are published by most major publishers, including Berkley Books, Harlequin's LUNA and MIRA, Pocket Books, Kensington Books, Dorchester Publishing, Avon Books, and NAL. The e-Book publisher Ellora's Cave has published many erotic romances with fantasy themes and other-worldly heroes and heroines.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grant|2007|p=231}}</ref>\n\nThere is overlap in these subgenres. [[Steampunk]] is science fiction mixed with alternate history which takes place during the Victorian era. It mixes historical elements with technology (think of the television series ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' (1965\u20131969)). Authors to check out include [[M. K. Hobson]] and Gail Dayton.<ref>{{harvtxt|Palmquist|2012|p=68}}</ref>\n\nThe first futuristic romance to be marketed by a mainstream romance publisher, [[Jayne Ann Krentz]]'s ''Sweet Starfire'', was published in 1986 and was a \"classic road trip romance\" that just happened to be set in a separate galaxy.<ref name=\"gelsomino\"/> This genre has become more popular since 2000.

In a smaller subset of these novels, the hero, who lives in the past, travels forward into his future to meet the heroine. A successful time-travel romance must have the characters react logically to their experience and should investigate some of the differences, both physical and mental, between the world the character normally inhabits and the one where they landed. Some writers end their novels with the protagonists trapped in different time periods and unable to be together\u2014to the displeasure of many readers of the genre.<ref name=\"timetravel\">{{cite web|last=Marble|first=Anne M.|title=Writing Time Travel Romances|publisher=Writing-world.Com|date=September 2002|url=http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble05.shtml|accessdate=July 30, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070626181045/http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble05.shtml |archivedate = June 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Inspirational romance===\nInspirational romance, as the market exists today, combines explicitly [[Christian fiction|Christian]] themes with the development of a romantic relationship.<ref name=\"rwasub\"/> In 2004, 167 novels were published in the inspirational romance subgenre.<ref name=\"rwastat\"/> These novels typically do not include gratuitous violence or swearing, and the central courtship is chaste.

The ENCANTO novels were originally released in two ways - a bilingual Spanish/English version and a Spanish-only version. Two novels were published every month until late 2001, when the line went into hiatus. Despite the demise of the line, several of the ENCANTO authors have continued writing novels with Latino protagonists, namely Sylvia Mendoza, Tracy Montoya, Caridad Pineiro, Berta Platas, Lara Rios and Lynda Sandoval.\n\nAlthough romance novels featuring African-Americans and Hispanic protagonists are becoming more popular, those featuring Asian or Asian-American characters are rare. Author [[Tess Gerritsen]] believes this is due to the fact that there are fewer Asian-American women who read romances: \"We read romances because we want to feel good about love...in order to do that, the reader must identify with the heroine.\"<ref name=\"nguyen\">{{Cite news   | last = Nguyen  | first = Lan| title = The Color of Romance | newspaper =Audrey Magazine  | date = September 2005  | url =http://www.audreymagazine.com/Sep2005/Living03.asp| accessdate = April 30, 2007   | format = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070406210723/http://www.audreymagazine.com/Sep2005/Living03.asp |archivedate = April 6, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Erotic romance===\n{{Main|Erotic romance novels}}\n\nErotic romance is a blend of romance and [[erotica]]. Erotic romance novels are characterized by strong sexual content, but can contain elements of any of the other romance subgenres. Erotic romance novels tend to use more frank language, avoiding many of the euphemisms used in books with milder content. These novels also usually include more sex scenes, often focusing more on the sex act rather than being a more traditional love scene, and may include more unusual positions or acts.<ref name=\"marbleerotic\"/> Despite a greater emphasis on the sex scenes, however, erotic romance is distinguishable from traditional [[pornography]]. Pornography concentrates on the sex acts, but erotic novels include well-developed characters and a plot that could exist without the sex acts.<ref name=\"cooperposey\">{{cite web|last=Cooper-Posey|first=Tracy|title=An End to Euphemisms: Is Erotica Right for You?|publisher=Writing-world.Com|year=2004|url=http://www.writing-world.com/romance/romantica.shtml|accessdate=July 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nErotic romances' lengths run from short stories to single-title novels. Some of these are published as part of a category, such as Harlequin Blaze, while others are published as part of an anthology and are only [[novella]] length. Even single-title erotic romances may be as short as a novella, however.<ref name=\"marbleerotic\">{{cite web|last=Marble|first=Anne M.|title=Getting to Know the Erotic Romance Field|publisher=Writing-World.Com|date=January 2005|url=http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble23.shtml|accessdate=July 30, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211135434/http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble23.shtml |archivedate = February 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\nMany of the publishers of erotic romance are either [[small press]] publishers or [[electronic book]] publishers. Writers often have more leeway as to what types of erotic acts can be included when working with an electronic publisher than they would have when working with a print publisher.<ref name=marbleerotic/> The market for erotic romances has been growing rapidly, leading some publishers to create new lines for these types of books.<ref name=\"avonred\">{{cite web | title = Avon Red | publisher = [[Avon (publishers)]] | url =http://www.harpercollins.com/imprints/index.aspx?imprintid=518015| accessdate = May 11, 2008}}</ref> Some subjects are still considered taboo, even with erotic romance.

''Pamela'' was the first popular novel to be based on a courtship as told from the perspective of the heroine. Unlike many of the novels of the time, ''Pamela'' had a happy ending, when after Mr. B attempts unsuccessfully to seduce and rape Pamela multiple times, he eventually rewards her virtue by sincerely proposing an equitable marriage to her. The book was one of the first bestsellers, with five editions printed in the first eleven months of release.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 63, 64, 66</ref>\n\n[[Jane Austen]] is an important influence on romance [[genre fiction]], and ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', published in 1813, has been called \"the best romance novel ever written.\"<ref>Regis (2003), p 75.</ref> In the early part of the [[Victorian era]], the [[Bront\u00eb|Bront\u00eb sisters]], like Austen, wrote [[literary fiction]] that influenced later popular fiction. [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] in ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', published in 1847, introduced the orphaned heroine. Bront\u00eb's love romance incorporates elements of both the [[Gothic fiction|gothic novel]] and [[Elizabethan drama]], and  \"demonstrate[s] the flexibility of the romance novel form.\"<ref>Regis (2003), p. 85.</ref>\n\nWhile the literary fiction romance continued to develop in the 20th century, the new subgenre of genre fiction, which first developed in the 19th century, started to become more popular after the [[First World War]]. In 1919, [[E.M. Hull]]'s novel ''[[The Sheik (novel)|The Sheik]]'' was published in the [[United Kingdom]]. The novel, which became hugely popular, was adapted into a [[The Sheik (film)|movie]] (1921), which established star [[Rudolph Valentino]] as the top male actor of the time. The hero of this book was an iconic [[alpha male]] who kidnapped the heroine and won her admiration through his forceful actions. The novel was one of the first modern works to introduce the [[rape fantasy]], a theme explored in Samuel Richardson's ''Pamela'' (1740). Although women were gaining more independence in life, publishers believed that readers would only accept premarital sex in the context of rape. In this novel and those that followed, the rape was depicted as more of a fantasy; the heroine is rarely if ever shown experiencing terror, stress, or trauma as a result.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 115\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe popular, mass market version of the [[historical novel|historical romance]], which [[Walter Scott]] developed in the early 19th century, is seen as beginning in 1921, when [[Georgette Heyer]] published ''The Black Moth''. This is set in 1751, but many of Heyer's novels were inspired by Jane Austen's novels and are set around the time Austen lived, in the later [[Regency period]]. Because Heyer's romances are set more than 100 years earlier, she includes carefully researched historical detail to help her readers understand the period.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 125-126.</ref> Unlike other popular love-romance novels of the time, Heyer's novels used the setting as a major plot device. Her characters often exhibit twentieth century sensibilities, and more conventional characters in the novels point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love.<ref>Regis (2003), p. 127.</ref> Heyer was a prolific author, and wrote one to two historical romance novels per year until her death in 1974.<ref>Regis (2003), p 125.</ref>\n\n===Rise of the category romance===\nIn the 1930s, the British publishers [[Mills & Boon]] began releasing hardback romance novels. The books were sold through weekly two-penny libraries and were known as \"the books in brown\" for their brown binding. In the 1950s, the company began offering the books for sale through newsagents across the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"mandb\">{{cite web|title=Mills & Boon - Our History|url=http://www.millsandboon.co.uk/cgi-bin/millsandboon.filereader?461262c700a12d24273f58d0dc9e068f+EN/catalogs/1124|publisher=Harlequin Mills and Boon|accessdate=July 19, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013164823/http://millsandboon.co.uk/cgi-bin/millsandboon.filereader?461262c700a12d24273f58d0dc9e068f+EN%2Fcatalogs%2F1124|archivedate=October 13, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nA Canadian company, [[Harlequin Enterprises]], began distributing in North America in 1957 the category romances published by Mills & Boon.<ref name=\"Thurston 1987, p. 42\">Thurston (1987), p. 42.</ref> Mary Bonneycastle, wife of Harlequin founder Richard Bonneycastle, and her daughter, Judy Burgess, exercised editorial control over which Mills & Boon novels Harlequin reprinted. They had a \"decency code,\" and rejected more sexually explicit material that Mills and Boon submitted for reprinting. Realizing that the genre was popular, Richard Bonneycastle finally decided to read a romance novel. He chose one of the more explicit novels and enjoyed it. On his orders, the company conducted a market test with the novel he had read and discovered that it outsold a similar, tamer novel.<ref>Regis (2003), p. 185</ref> Overall, the novels were short and formulaic, featuring heroines who were sweet, compassionate, pure and innocent. The few heroines who worked did so in traditional female jobs, including as [[nurse]]s, [[governess]]es and [[secretary|secretaries]]. Intimacy in the novels never extended beyond a chaste kiss between the protagonists.<ref name=\"Thurston 1987, p. 42\"/>\n\nOn October 1, 1971, Harlequin purchased Mills & Boon. By this point, the romance novel genre \"had been popularized and distributed widely to an enthusiastic audience\" in [[Great Britain]]. In an attempt to duplicate Mills & Boon's success in North America, Harlequin improved their distribution and marketing system.<ref name=\"Regis 2003, p. 156\">Regis (2003), p. 156.</ref> By choosing to sell their books \"where the women are,\" they allowed many mass-market merchandisers and even supermarkets to sell the books, all of which were exactly 192 pages. Harlequin then began a reader service, selling directly to readers who agreed to purchase a certain number of books each month.<ref>Thurston, pp. 46-47.</ref>\n\n===<span id=\"Birth of modern romance\"></span>The beginnings of American romance fiction===\nIn the US, modern romance genre fiction was born in 1972, with [[Avon Books|Avon's]] publication of [[Kathleen Woodiwiss]]'s ''[[The Flame and the Flower]]'', which was the first of the modern \"bodice ripper\" romance novels to follow \"the principals into the bedroom.\"<ref name=\"athitakis\">{{Cite news   | last = Athitakis  | first = Mark  | title = A Romance Glossary  | newspaper = SF Weekly  | date = July 25, 2001  | url =http://www.sfweekly.com/2001-07-25/news/a-romance-glossary/  | accessdate = April 23, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"zaitchik\"/> Aside from its content, the book was revolutionary in that it was one of the first single-title romance novels to be published as an original [[paperback]], rather than being first published in [[hardcover]], and, like the category romances, was distributed in drug stores and other mass-market merchandising outlets.<ref name=\"thurston4748\"/> The novel went on to sell 2.35&nbsp;million copies.<ref name=\"darrach\">{{Cite news  | last =Darrach  | first =Brad  | title = Rosemary's Babies    | newspaper = Time| date = January 17, 1977    | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918604-2,00.html|accessdate=July 17, 2007}}</ref> Avon followed its release with the 1974 publication of Woodiwiss's second novel, ''The Wolf and the Dove'' and two more sexually graphic novels by newcomer [[Rosemary Rogers]], ''Sweet Savage Love'' and ''Dark Fires''. The latter sold two million copies in its first three months of release.

The women were [[virgins]], while the men were not, and both members of the couple were described as beautiful.<ref>Thurston, p 75.</ref>\n\n===Category romance adapts===\nCategory romance lines were slower to react to some of the changes that had swept the historical romance subgenre. Despite the fact that the former Mills & Boon lines were now owned by a [[North America]]n company, the lines did not have any American writers until 1975, when Harlequin purchased a novel by [[Janet Dailey]].<ref>Thurston (1987), pp. 46-47.</ref><ref>Regis (2003), pp. 155\u2013156</ref> Dailey's novels provided the romance genre's \"first look at heroines, heroes and courtships that take place in America, with American sensibilities, assumptions, history, and most of all, settings.\"<ref>Regis (2003), p. 159.</ref> Harlequin was unsure how the market would react to this new type of romance, and was unwilling to fully embrace it. In the late 1970s, a Harlequin editor rejected a manuscript by [[Nora Roberts]], who has since become the top-selling romance author, because \"they already had their American writer.\"<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 158, 183, 184.</ref>\n\nHarlequin sold almost $70&nbsp;million of its paperback romances in 1979 through 100,000 supermarkets and other stores, giving the company almost 10% of the market for paperback books. That year the company began distributing its own books in the United States instead of through [[Simon & Schuster]]'s [[Pocket Books]]. In 1980 Simon & Schuster formed Silhouette Books to publish its own romance novels, beginning what ''The New York Times'' called \"perhaps the most bitter war in American book publishing history.\"<ref name=\"walters19801012\">{{cite news | title=Paperback Talk | work=The New York Times | date=October 12, 1980 | author=Walters, Ray | pages=A47}}</ref> The company sought to take advantage of the untapped talent of the American writers.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 156, 159.</ref> They published several lines of category romance, and encouraged their writers to create stronger heroines and less dominant heroes. Authors were also expected to address contemporary issues where appropriate.<ref>Regis (2003), p. 184</ref> Silhouette soon saw their market share expand, and in 1984, Harlequin acquired them. Despite the acquisition, Silhouette continued to retain editorial control and to publish various lines under their own imprint.<ref name=\"Regis 2003, p. 156\"/>\n\nHarlequin had also failed to adapt quickly to the signs that readers appreciated novels with more explicit sex scenes, and in 1980, several publishers entered the category romance market to fill that gap. That year, Dell launched their Candlelight Ecstasy line with [[Amii Lorin]]'s ''The Tawny Gold Man'', becoming the first line to waive the requirement that heroines be virgins. By the end of 1983 sales for the Candlelight Ecstasy line totaled $30&nbsp;million. Silhoeutte also launched similar lines, Desire (sexually explicit) and Special Edition (sexually explicit and longer stories, up to 250 pages), each of which had a 90\u2013100% sellout rate each month.<ref name=\"barret\">{{Cite news  | last =Barrett  | first =Mary Ellin  | title =Pure as the Driven Slush  | newspaper =Family Weekly  | date =January 9, 1983  | url =http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%203.pdf  | format =PDF  | accessdate =May 24, 2007  | url-status =dead  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004649/http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%203.pdf  | archivedate =September 27, 2007  | df =mdy-all  }}</ref>\n\nA 1982 survey of romance readers confirmed that the new styles of writing were attracting new readers to the genre. 35% of the readers surveyed had begun reading romances after 1977. An additional 31% of those surveyed had been readers for between 6 and 10 years, meaning they had become interested in the genre after 1972, when Woodiwiss's revolutionary novel was published. This means that two-thirds of those surveyed joined the genre after it had begun to change.<ref>Thurston, pp. 127-128.</ref>\n\nThe number of category romance lines increased at a rapid pace, and by 1985 there were 16 separate lines producing a total of 80 novels per month.<ref>Regis (2003), p. 157.</ref> The sudden increase in category romance lines meant an equally sudden increase in demand for writers of the new style of romance novel. This tight market caused a proportionate decrease in the quality of the novels that were being released. By 1984, the market was saturated with category lines and readers had begun to complain of redundancy in plots.<ref>Thurston, p 188.</ref> The following year, the \"dampening effect of the high level of redundancy associated with series romances was evident in the decreased number of titles being read per month.\"<ref>Thurston, p 128.</ref> Harlequin's return rate, which had been less than 25% in 1978, when it was the primary provider of category romance, swelled to 60%.<ref>Thurston, p 190.</ref>\n\n===Further change===\nThe genre continued to expand in the mid-to-late 1980s, as publishers realized that the more popular authors were often those who stretched the boundaries of the genre.

Mass-market historical romance novels are rarely published in hardcover, with fewer than 15 receiving that status each year, less than one-fifth of the number of contemporary romance novels published in that format. Because historical romances are primarily published in mass-market format, their fortunes are tied to a certain extent to the mass-market trends.

The e-Book publisher Ellora's Cave has published many erotic romances with fantasy themes and other-worldly heroes and heroines.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grant|2007|p=231}}</ref>\n\nThere is overlap in these subgenres. [[Steampunk]] is science fiction mixed with alternate history which takes place during the Victorian era.

In most, the heroine is from the present day and travels into the past to meet the hero. In a smaller subset of these novels, the hero, who lives in the past, travels forward into his future to meet the heroine. A successful time-travel romance must have the characters react logically to their experience and should investigate some of the differences, both physical and mental, between the world the character normally inhabits and the one where they landed. Some writers end their novels with the protagonists trapped in different time periods and unable to be together\u2014to the displeasure of many readers of the genre.<ref name=\"timetravel\">{{cite web|last=Marble|first=Anne M.|title=Writing Time Travel Romances|publisher=Writing-world.Com|date=September 2002|url=http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble05.shtml|accessdate=July 30, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070626181045/http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble05.shtml |archivedate = June 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Inspirational romance===\nInspirational romance, as the market exists today, combines explicitly [[Christian fiction|Christian]] themes with the development of a romantic relationship.<ref name=\"rwasub\"/> In 2004, 167 novels were published in the inspirational romance subgenre.<ref name=\"rwastat\"/> These novels typically do not include gratuitous violence or swearing, and the central courtship is chaste.

Author [[Tess Gerritsen]] believes this is due to the fact that there are fewer Asian-American women who read romances: \"We read romances because we want to feel good about love...in order to do that, the reader must identify with the heroine.\"<ref name=\"nguyen\">{{Cite news   | last = Nguyen  | first = Lan| title = The Color of Romance | newspaper =Audrey Magazine  | date = September 2005  | url =http://www.audreymagazine.com/Sep2005/Living03.asp| accessdate = April 30, 2007   | format = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070406210723/http://www.audreymagazine.com/Sep2005/Living03.asp |archivedate = April 6, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Erotic romance===\n{{Main|Erotic romance novels}}\n\nErotic romance is a blend of romance and [[erotica]]. Erotic romance novels are characterized by strong sexual content, but can contain elements of any of the other romance subgenres. Erotic romance novels tend to use more frank language, avoiding many of the euphemisms used in books with milder content. These novels also usually include more sex scenes, often focusing more on the sex act rather than being a more traditional love scene, and may include more unusual positions or acts.<ref name=\"marbleerotic\"/> Despite a greater emphasis on the sex scenes, however, erotic romance is distinguishable from traditional [[pornography]]. Pornography concentrates on the sex acts, but erotic novels include well-developed characters and a plot that could exist without the sex acts.<ref name=\"cooperposey\">{{cite web|last=Cooper-Posey|first=Tracy|title=An End to Euphemisms: Is Erotica Right for You?|publisher=Writing-world.Com|year=2004|url=http://www.writing-world.com/romance/romantica.shtml|accessdate=July 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nErotic romances' lengths run from short stories to single-title novels. Some of these are published as part of a category, such as Harlequin Blaze, while others are published as part of an anthology and are only [[novella]] length. Even single-title erotic romances may be as short as a novella, however.<ref name=\"marbleerotic\">{{cite web|last=Marble|first=Anne M.|title=Getting to Know the Erotic Romance Field|publisher=Writing-World.Com|date=January 2005|url=http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble23.shtml|accessdate=July 30, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211135434/http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble23.shtml |archivedate = February 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\nMany of the publishers of erotic romance are either [[small press]] publishers or [[electronic book]] publishers. Writers often have more leeway as to what types of erotic acts can be included when working with an electronic publisher than they would have when working with a print publisher.<ref name=marbleerotic/> The market for erotic romances has been growing rapidly, leading some publishers to create new lines for these types of books.<ref name=\"avonred\">{{cite web | title = Avon Red | publisher = [[Avon (publishers)]] | url =http://www.harpercollins.com/imprints/index.aspx?imprintid=518015| accessdate = May 11, 2008}}</ref> Some subjects are still considered taboo, even with erotic romance. Themes such as pedophilia, incest, and bestiality are discouraged by all publishers.<ref name=\"marbleerotic\"/>\n\nThe market for erotic romances has grown rapidly. [[Ellora's Cave]], an electronic publisher that focuses on erotic romance, became the first electronic publisher recognized by the Romance Writers of America as a legitimate publisher.<ref name=\"cooperposey\"/>\n\n===Chick lit===\nChick lit or chick literature is named after the readership it attracts (women in their twenties and thirties), and it is said to be inspired by the 1996 novel ''Bridget Jones' Diary''. Some of the dominant themes of chick lit are a single woman's journey through career, high-powered work environment, personal life, relationships, motherhood, parenting, etc. Some subcategories of this genre are baby lit and mummy lit <ref>{{cite book |last1=Parv |first1=Valerie |title=The Art of Romance Writing |date=2004 |publisher=Allen & Unwin |location=Austrailia |isbn=1741143748 |page=8 |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n==Markets==\n\n===North America===\nThe romance fiction market \"has been impervious to the overall economic recession, with faithful readers spending up to $40 a month\" on romance novels in 1982.<ref name=\"nyt1982\">\n{{Cite news  | title = Expanding Romance Market  | newspaper = [[New York Times]]  | date =  March 8, 1982  | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/08/business/expanding-romance-market.html |accessdate = May 24, 2007}}</ref>  That year, paperback romances totaled $300&nbsp;million in sales, and the total audience was estimated at 20&nbsp;million readers.

She served as [[\u00f6verhovm\u00e4starinna]] to two queens of Sweden, [[Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden]] and [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia]], and as Royal Governess to the royal children. [[Gustav III of Sweden]] refers to her with affection and admiration in his writings.\n\n==Life==\nHedvig Elisabet Str\u00f6mfelt was the daughter of colonel nobleman Jurgen Johan Wrangel and Margareta Stenbock and married to [[riksr\u00e5d]] count Johan Carl Str\u00f6mfelt (1678-1736). She became the mother of three children, among them [[Ulrika Str\u00f6mfelt]].\n\nAfter having been widowed, Str\u00f6mfelt was appointed ''[[\u00f6verhovm\u00e4starinna]]'' (Mistress of the Robes) to [[Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden]] in 1736 in succession to Katarina Ebba Horn af \u00c5minne, making her the senior of all the female courtiers, and served until the queen's death in 1741. As such, she was the first in rank of all the female office holders of the royal household with responsibility of the ladies-in-waiting and the performance of court etiquette around them and the queen. \n\nUpon the marriage of the crown prince to [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia]] in 1744, she resumed her post at the court of Louisa Ulrika, and welcomed her with the rest of the late queen's court at Gnatskow in [[Swedish Pomerania]].  With experience in Swedish court etiquette, she was able to guide Louisa Ulrika in the new court, and described as having a wise judgement in combination with a lovable and youthful appearance, she gained the confidence of Louisa Ulrika. \n\nLouisa Ulrika described her in a letter to her mother: \n:\"The countess Str\u00f6mfelt ... is a very good woman and I started on the right foot with her because she does all that I want and is absolutely not irksome. It is the same with all my other ladies-in-waiting. [...] All my ladies-in-waiting are very beautiful and very funny, each of the can take part in a conversation with no risk of ruining it.\" <ref>Elise M.
