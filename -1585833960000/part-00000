A subdistrict of the Bywater District Area, its boundaries as defined by the City Planning Commission are: Florida Avenue to the north, the [[Industrial Canal]] to the east, the [[Mississippi River]] to the south, and the railroad tracks along Homer Plessy Way (formerly Press Street) to the west.  Bywater is part of the [[Ninth Ward of New Orleans]]; but it is located along the natural [[levee]] of the Mississippi River, sparing the area from significant flooding.  It includes part or all of '''Bywater Historic District''', which is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=city-bywater>{{cite web |title=Bywater |url=http://www.nola.gov/RESIDENTS/HDLC/Districts%20and%20Maps/Bywater/ |work=Historic District Landmarks Commission |publisher=The City of New Orleans |accessdate=9 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130034357/http://www.nola.gov/RESIDENTS/HDLC/Districts%20and%20Maps/Bywater/ |archivedate=30 January 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDuring [[New Orleans Mardi Gras]], the [[Society of Saint Anne]] marching [[krewe]] starts their procession on Mardi Gras morning in Bywater and gathers marchers as it travels through the [[French Quarter]], ending at [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]]. This walking parade of local residents, artists, and performers is preceded by the Bywater Bone Boys Social Aid and Pleasure Club (founded 2005), an early-rising skeleton krewe made up of writers, tattoo artists, painters, set designers, musicians, and numerous other pre&ndash;7 a.m. revelers.\n\nAfter [[Hurricane Katrina]], many survivors flocked to the area as it was less affected by the storm, due to the slightly higher elevation closer to the Mississippi river. Bywater became part of what was known as the \"[[Sliver by the River]],\" meaning neighborhoods that saw no flooding, including [[Faubourg Marigny]], the [[French Quarter]] and [[Irish Channel, New Orleans|Irish Channel]] neighborhoods, and parts of the lower [[Garden District, New Orleans|Garden District]] including [[St. Charles Avenue]].<ref name=sliver>{{cite news|last=Ellwood|first=Mark|title=Sliver by the river|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/cf16a41a-799c-11df-85be-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1DQ5hiF3N|accessdate=9 February 2011|newspaper=Financial Times|date=19 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBywater is located at {{Coord|29|57|46|N|90|02|24|W|type:city}} <ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> and has an elevation of {{convert|3|ft|1}}.<ref name=\"GR3\">{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=US Board on Geographic Names|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=2007-10-25}}</ref>  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the district has a total area of {{convert|1.33|sqmi|1}},  {{convert|0.94|sqmi|1}} of which is land and {{convert|0.39|sqmi|1}} (29.32%) of which is water.\n\n===Adjacent neighborhoods===\n* [[Desire Area, New Orleans|Desire Area]] (north)\n* [[Lower Ninth Ward, New Orleans|Lower Ninth Ward]] (east)\n* [[Holy Cross, New Orleans|Holy Cross]] (east)\n* [[Mississippi River]] (south)\n* [[Marigny, New Orleans|Marigny]] (west)\n* [[St. Claude, New Orleans|St. Claude]] (west)\n* [[Florida Area, New Orleans|Florida Area]] (west)\n\n===Boundaries===\n\nThe traditional boundaries of Bywater are: the Mississippi River to St. Claude Avenue, and the railroad tracks along Homer Plessy Way (formerly Press Street) to the Industrial Canal. Press Street's name came from a [[cotton]] press (known elsewhere as a cotton compress) which operated here during the 19th century. The Bywater/Marigny stretch of Press Street was changed to Homer Plessy Way in 2018 to memorialize Homer Plessy, the plaintiff in Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation laws for public facilities.\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[census]] of 2000, there were 5,096 people, 2,263 households, and 1,030 families residing in the neighborhood.<ref name=\"Bywater Neighborhood\">{{cite web|title=Bywater Neighborhood|url=http://gnocdc.org/NeighborhoodData/7/Bywater/index.html|publisher=Greater New Orleans Community Data Center|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>  The [[population density]] was 5,421 /mi\u00b2 (2,123 /km\u00b2).\n\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010, there were 3,337 people, 1,763 households, and 573 families residing in the neighborhood.<ref name=\"Bywater Neighborhood\"/>  The [[population density]] was 5,421 /mi\u00b2 (2,123 /km\u00b2).\n\n==History==\nThe area now known as Bywater was mostly plantation land in the colonial era, with significant residential development beginning the first decade of the 19th century as part of what was known as \"Faubourg Washington,\" part of the predominantly [[French language|Francophone]] \"[[downtown New Orleans|downtown]]\" section of New Orleans. Many people from France, Spain, and the French [[Caribbean]] settled here. During the century, it grew with both white Creoles of French and Spanish descent, as well as mixed-race Creoles of French, Spanish, [[African people|African]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] descent. They were also joined by immigrants from [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Ireland]].\n\nThe Bywater is home to the site at which [[Homer Plessy]] was removed from an East Louisiana Railroad car for violating the separate car act, an event that resulted in the [[Plessy v. Ferguson]] case and the legal doctrine of \"[[separate but equal]].\" Today, a historical marker stands at the intersection of Press Street and [[Royal Street, New Orleans|Royal Street]] to commemorate the event.<ref name=Plessy>{{cite news|last=Reckdahl|first=Katy|title=Plessy and Ferguson unveil plaque today marking their ancestors' actions|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/02/plessy_vs_ferguson_photo.html|accessdate=9 February 2011|newspaper=The Times Picayune|date=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nThere was little distinction between this area and what became known as the [[Lower 9th Ward]] until the [[Industrial Canal]] was dredged in the early 20th century, dividing the two.\n\nA generation knew the area as the \"Upper 9th Ward,\" but as other parts of the 9th Ward above the Canal farther from the River became developed, a more specific name was needed. Inspired by the local [[telephone exchange]] designation of Bywater, which fit the neighborhood's proximity to the River and the Canal, the neighborhood was known as \"Bywater\" by the 1940s.\n\n[[Real estate development]] and [[speculation]] surrounding the [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition]] prompted many long-term [[French Quarter]] residents to move down river, at first into Marigny.

Bywater became part of what was known as the \"[[Sliver by the River]],\" meaning neighborhoods that saw no flooding, including [[Faubourg Marigny]], the [[French Quarter]] and [[Irish Channel, New Orleans|Irish Channel]] neighborhoods, and parts of the lower [[Garden District, New Orleans|Garden District]] including [[St. Charles Avenue]].<ref name=sliver>{{cite news|last=Ellwood|first=Mark|title=Sliver by the river|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/cf16a41a-799c-11df-85be-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1DQ5hiF3N|accessdate=9 February 2011|newspaper=Financial Times|date=19 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBywater is located at {{Coord|29|57|46|N|90|02|24|W|type:city}} <ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> and has an elevation of {{convert|3|ft|1}}.<ref name=\"GR3\">{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=US Board on Geographic Names|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=2007-10-25}}</ref>  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the district has a total area of {{convert|1.33|sqmi|1}},  {{convert|0.94|sqmi|1}} of which is land and {{convert|0.39|sqmi|1}} (29.32%) of which is water.\n\n===Adjacent neighborhoods===\n* [[Desire Area, New Orleans|Desire Area]] (north)\n* [[Lower Ninth Ward, New Orleans|Lower Ninth Ward]] (east)\n* [[Holy Cross, New Orleans|Holy Cross]] (east)\n* [[Mississippi River]] (south)\n* [[Marigny, New Orleans|Marigny]] (west)\n* [[St. Claude, New Orleans|St. Claude]] (west)\n* [[Florida Area, New Orleans|Florida Area]] (west)\n\n===Boundaries===\n\nThe traditional boundaries of Bywater are: the Mississippi River to St. Claude Avenue, and the railroad tracks along Homer Plessy Way (formerly Press Street) to the Industrial Canal. Press Street's name came from a [[cotton]] press (known elsewhere as a cotton compress) which operated here during the 19th century. The Bywater/Marigny stretch of Press Street was changed to Homer Plessy Way in 2018 to memorialize Homer Plessy, the plaintiff in Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation laws for public facilities.\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[census]] of 2000, there were 5,096 people, 2,263 households, and 1,030 families residing in the neighborhood.<ref name=\"Bywater Neighborhood\">{{cite web|title=Bywater Neighborhood|url=http://gnocdc.org/NeighborhoodData/7/Bywater/index.html|publisher=Greater New Orleans Community Data Center|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>  The [[population density]] was 5,421 /mi\u00b2 (2,123 /km\u00b2).\n\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010, there were 3,337 people, 1,763 households, and 573 families residing in the neighborhood.<ref name=\"Bywater Neighborhood\"/>  The [[population density]] was 5,421 /mi\u00b2 (2,123 /km\u00b2).\n\n==History==\nThe area now known as Bywater was mostly plantation land in the colonial era, with significant residential development beginning the first decade of the 19th century as part of what was known as \"Faubourg Washington,\" part of the predominantly [[French language|Francophone]] \"[[downtown New Orleans|downtown]]\" section of New Orleans. Many people from France, Spain, and the French [[Caribbean]] settled here. During the century, it grew with both white Creoles of French and Spanish descent, as well as mixed-race Creoles of French, Spanish, [[African people|African]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] descent. They were also joined by immigrants from [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Ireland]].\n\nThe Bywater is home to the site at which [[Homer Plessy]] was removed from an East Louisiana Railroad car for violating the separate car act, an event that resulted in the [[Plessy v. Ferguson]] case and the legal doctrine of \"[[separate but equal]].\" Today, a historical marker stands at the intersection of Press Street and [[Royal Street, New Orleans|Royal Street]] to commemorate the event.<ref name=Plessy>{{cite news|last=Reckdahl|first=Katy|title=Plessy and Ferguson unveil plaque today marking their ancestors' actions|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/02/plessy_vs_ferguson_photo.html|accessdate=9 February 2011|newspaper=The Times Picayune|date=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nThere was little distinction between this area and what became known as the [[Lower 9th Ward]] until the [[Industrial Canal]] was dredged in the early 20th century, dividing the two.\n\nA generation knew the area as the \"Upper 9th Ward,\" but as other parts of the 9th Ward above the Canal farther from the River became developed, a more specific name was needed. Inspired by the local [[telephone exchange]] designation of Bywater, which fit the neighborhood's proximity to the River and the Canal, the neighborhood was known as \"Bywater\" by the 1940s.\n\n[[Real estate development]] and [[speculation]] surrounding the [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition]] prompted many long-term [[French Quarter]] residents to move down river, at first into Marigny. By the late 1990s the [[bohemianism|bohemian]], artistic type of communities such as were found in the French Quarter mid-20th century had spread to Bywater, and many long-neglected 19th-century houses began to be refurbished.\n\nBywater and neighboring [[Faubourg Marigny]] are two of the most colorful neighborhoods in the city.

[[Theodor Capidan]] went further, claiming that the structure of Balkan languages could be reduced to a standard language. Many of the earliest reports on this theory were in [[German language|German]], hence the term \"Balkansprachbund\" is often used as well.\n\n==Languages==\nThe languages that share these similarities belong to five distinct branches of the Indo-European languages:\n* [[Albanian language|Albanian]]\n* [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic]] ([[Greek language|Greek]])\n* [[Romance languages|Romance]] ([[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romance]] and [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]])\n* [[Balkan Slavic]] ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and the [[Prizren-Timok dialect]] of Serbian.)\n* [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ([[Romani language|Romani]])\n\nThe Finnish linguist [[Jouko Lindstedt]] computed in 2000 a \"Balkanization factor\" which gives each Balkan language a score proportional with the number of features shared in the Balkan language area.<ref name=\"langcontact\">{{cite book |last=Lindstedt |first=J. |year=2000 |chapter=Linguistic Balkanization: Contact-induced change by mutual reinforcement |pages=231\u2013246 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqQgBVXp_H4C |editor=D.G.

The grammatical features shared (especially regarding the tense system) were most likely borrowed from Greek.\n\n==Origins==\nThe source of these features as well as the directions have long been debated, and various theories were suggested.\n\n===Thracian, Illyrian or Dacian and Albanian as successive language===\nSince most of these features cannot be found in languages related to those that belong to the language area (such as other Slavic or Romance languages),{{Dubious|date=March 2011}} early researchers, including Kopitar, believed they must have been inherited from the [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] (e.g. [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Dacian language|Dacian]]) which formed the [[Substratum|substrate]] for modern Balkan languages.  But since very little is known about Paleo-Balkan languages, it cannot be determined whether the features were present. The strongest candidate for a shared Paleo-Balkan feature is the postposed article. The Albanian language originates from one of these languages.\n\n===Greek===\nAnother theory, advanced by Kristian Sandfeld in 1930, was that these features were an entirely Greek influence, under the presumption that since Greece \"always had a superior civilization compared to its neighbours\", Greek could not have borrowed its linguistic features from them. However, no ancient dialects of Greek possessed Balkanisms, so that the features shared with other regional languages appear to be post-classical innovations. Also, Greek appears to be only peripheral to the Balkan language area, lacking some important features, such as the postposed article. Nevertheless, several of the features that Greek does share with the other languages (loss of dative, replacement of infinitive by subjunctive constructions, object clitics, formation of future with auxiliary verb \"to want\") probably originated in [[Medieval Greek]] and spread to the other languages through Byzantine influence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Horrocks|first1=Geoffrey|title=Greek: A History of the Language and its Speakers|date=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester|pages=227\u2013229|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n===Latin and Romance===\nThe Roman Empire ruled all the Balkans, and [[Common Romanian|local variation of Latin]] may have left its mark on all languages there, which were later the substrate to Slavic newcomers. This was proposed by [[Georg Solta]]. The weak point of this theory is that other Romance languages have few of the features, and there is no proof that the Balkan Romans were isolated for enough time to develop them. An argument for this would be the structural borrowings or \"linguistic [[calque]]s\" into Macedonian from Aromanian, which could be explained by Aromanian being a substrate of Macedonian, but this still does not explain the origin of these innovations in Aromanian. The analytic perfect with the auxiliary verb \"to have\" (which some Balkan languages share with Western European languages), is the only feature whose origin can fairly safely be traced to Latin.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Multiple sources===\nThe most commonly accepted theory, advanced by Polish scholar Zbigniew Go\u0142\u0105b, is that the innovations came from different sources and the languages influenced each other: some features can be traced from Latin, Slavic, or Greek languages, whereas others, particularly features that are shared only by Romanian, Albanian, Macedonian and Bulgarian, could be explained by the substratum kept after Romanization (in the case of Romanian) or Slavicization (in the case of Bulgarian). Albanian was influenced by both Latin and Slavic, but it kept many of its original characteristics.\n\nSeveral arguments favour this theory. First, throughout the turbulent [[history of the Balkans]], many groups of people moved to another place, inhabited by people of another ethnicity. These small groups were usually assimilated quickly and sometimes left marks in the new language they acquired. Second, the use of more than one language was common in the Balkans before the modern age, and a [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] in one language would quickly spread to other languages.  Third, the dialects that have the most \"balkanisms\" are those in regions where people had contact with people of many other languages.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Grammatical features===\n\n====Case system====\nThe number of cases is reduced, several cases being replaced with prepositions, the only exception being Serbo-Croatian. In [[Bulgarian grammar|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian grammar|Macedonian]], on the other hand, this development has actually led to the loss of all cases except the [[vocative case|vocative]].\n\nA common case system of a Balkan language is:\n\n* [[Nominative case|Nominative]]\n* [[Accusative case|Accusative]]\n* [[Dative case|Dative]] / [[Genitive case|Genitive]] ([[Syncretism (linguistics)|merged]])\n* [[Vocative case|Vocative]]\n\n=====Syncretism of genitive and dative=====\nIn the Balkan languages, the [[genitive case|genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]] cases (or corresponding prepositional constructions) undergo [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]].\n\n''Example:''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This feature is present to varying degrees in each language.  Decategoralization is less advanced in fossilized literary Romanian ''{{lang|ro|voi}}'' and in Serbo-Croatian ''{{lang|sh|\u0107u, \u0107e\u0161, \u0107e}}'', where the future marker is still an inflected auxiliary. In modern Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian, Aromanian, and spoken Romanian, decategoralization and erosion have given rise to an uninflected tense form, where the frozen third-person singular of the verb has turned into an invariable particle followed by the main verb inflected for person (compare Rom 1.sg. ''{{lang|ro|voi}}'', 2.sg. ''{{lang|ro|vei}}'', 3.sg. ''{{lang|ro|va}}'' > invariable ''{{lang|ro|va}}'' > mod. ''{{lang|ro|o}}'').<ref>Bernd Heine & Tania Kuteva, ''Language Contact and Grammatical Change'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).</ref> Certain [[Torlakian dialect]]s also have an invariant future tense marker in the form of the proclitic third-person-singular present form of the verb 'to want': ''{{lang|sh|\u0107e vidim}}'' ({{lang|sh|\u045b\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c}}) 'I will see', ''{{lang|sh|\u0107e vidi\u0161}}'' ({{lang|sh|\u045b\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0448}}) \"you will see\", ''{{lang|sh|\u0107e vidi}}'' ({{lang|sh|\u045b\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438}}) 'he/she/it will see'.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" valign=top\n!

Unlike the avoidance of the infinitive, which had already come to encompass all Romani varieties before many of them were brought out of the Balkans into the rest of Europe, the formation of the future tense with a devolitive particle is apparently a later development, since it is only seen in those dialect groups that have not left the Balkans.</ref>\n| ''{{lang|rom|ka}}'' (inv.) + subjunctive\n| ''{{lang|rom|Ka dikhav}}''\n|}\n\n=====Analytic perfect tense=====\nThe analytic perfect tense is formed in the Balkan languages with the verb \"to have\" and, usually, a past passive participle, similarly to the construction found in Germanic and other Romance languages: e.g. Romanian ''{{lang|ro|am promis}}'' \"I have promised\", Albanian ''{{lang|sq|kam premtuar}}'' \"I have promised\". A somewhat less typical case of this is Greek, where the verb \"to have\" is followed by the so-called {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf}} ('invariant form', historically the aorist infinitive): {{lang|el|\u03ad\u03c7\u03c9 \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b8\u03b5\u03af}}. However, a completely different construction is used in Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian, which have inherited from Common Slavic an analytic perfect formed with the verb \"to be\" and the past ''active'' participle: {{lang|bg|\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043b \u0441\u044a\u043c}}, ''{{lang|bg-Latn|obe\u0161tal s\u01cem}}'' (Bul.) / {{lang|sr|\u043e\u0431\u0435\u045b\u0430\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c}}, ''{{lang|sr|obe\u0107ao sam}}'' (Ser.) - \"I have promised\" (lit. \"I am having-promised\"). On the other hand, Macedonian, the third Slavic language in the sprachbund, is like Romanian and Albanian in that it uses quite typical Balkan constructions consisting of the verb ''to have'' and a past passive participle ({{lang|mk|\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e}}, ''{{lang|mk-Latn|imam veteno}}'' = \"I have promised\"). Macedonian also has a perfect formed with the verb \"to be\", like Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian.\n\n=====Renarrative mood=====\nThe so-called [[Inferential mood#Renarrative in the Balkan languages|renarrative mood]] is another shared feature of the Balkan languages, including Turkish. It is used for statements that are not based on direct observation or common knowledge, but repeat what was reported by others. For example, \u041f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442 '''\u0431\u0438\u043b''' \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d in Macedonian means \"The road was closed (or so I heard)\". A speaker who uses the [[indicative mood]] instead and states \"\u041f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442 '''\u0431\u0435\u0448\u0435''' \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\" implies thereby that they personally witnessed the road's closure.\n\n=====Avoidance or loss of infinitive=====\nThe use of the infinitive (common in other languages related to some of the Balkan languages, such as Romance and Slavic) is generally replaced with subjunctive constructions, following early Greek innovation.\n\n* in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Tosk Albanian, the loss of the infinitive is complete\n* in [[Demotic Greek|demotic]] (vernacular) Greek, the loss of the infinitive was complete, whereas in literary Greek (''[[Katharevousa]]'', abolished in 1976) it was not; the natural fusion of the vernacular with ''Katharevousa'' resulted in the creation of the contemporary common Greek (Modern Standard Greek), where the infinitive, when used, is principally used as noun (e.g. {{lang|el|\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} \"speaking, fluency, eloquence\", {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} \"writing\", {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9}} \"being\", etc.) deriving directly from the ancient Greek infinitive formation. But its substitution by the subjunctive form when the infinitive would be used as a verb is complete. Most of the times, the subjunctive form substitutes the infinitive also in the cases when it would be used as a noun (e.g. {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c2}} / {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2}} \"to go, the act of going\", {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}} / {{lang|el|\u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}} \"to see/be seeing, the act of seeing\" instead of the infinitive \"{{lang|el|\u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}}\", etc.)\n* in Aromanian and Southern Serbo-Croatian dialects, it is almost complete\n* in Gheg Albanian and Megleno-Romanian, it is used only in a limited number of expressions\n* in standard Romanian (prepositional phrase: ''{{lang|ro|a}}'' + verb stem) and Serbo-Croatian, the infinitive shares many of its functions with the subjunctive. In these two languages, the infinitive will always be found in dictionaries and language textbooks. However, in Romanian, the inherited infinitive form (''{{lang|ro|-are}}'', ''{{lang|ro|-ere}}'', and ''{{lang|ro|-ire}}'') is now used only as a verbal noun.\n* Turkish as spoken in [[Sliven]] and [[Shumen|\u0160umen]] has also almost completely lost the infinitive, but not verbal nouns using the same grammatical form. This is clearly due to the influence of the Balkan sprachbund.\n\nFor example, \"I want to write\" in several Balkan languages:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Language\n! Example\n!

None of the related languages (like other Romance languages or Slavic languages) share this feature, with the notable exception of the [[Northern Russian dialects#Morphology|northern Russian dialects]], and it is thought to be an innovation created and spread in the Balkans. It is possible that postposed article in [[Balkan Slavic]] is the result of influence from [[Balkan Romance|Balkan Romance languages]] (Romanian or Aromanian) during the Middle ages.<ref>Theodor Capidan, Raporturile lingvistice slavo-rom\u00e2ne.

Greek does not follow this.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Language\n!The word \"Eleven\"\n!compounds\n|-\n| Albanian\n| \"nj\u00ebmb\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\"\n| nj\u00eb + mb\u00eb + dhjet\u00eb\n|-\n| Aromanian\n| \"unspr\u0103dzatsi\", commonly, \" unspr\u0103\" \n| un + spr\u0103 + dzatsi\n|-\n| Bulgarian\n| \"\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0442\"\n| \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d + (\u043d)\u0430(\u0434) + \u0434\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0442\n|-\n| Macedonian\n| \"\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0442\"\n| \u0435\u0434\u0435(\u0438)\u043d + (\u043d)\u0430(\u0434) + (\u0434)\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0442\n|-\n| Romanian\n| \"unsprezece\" or, more commonly, \"un\u0219pe\"\n| un + spre + zece < *unu + supre + dece; unu + spre; the latter is more commonly used, even in formal speech.\n|-\n| Serbo-Croatian\n| \"jedanaest/\u0458\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0441\u0442\"\n| jedan+ (n)a+ (d)es(e)t/\u0458\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d + (\u043d)\u0430 + (\u0434)\u0435\u0441(\u0435)\u0442. This is not the case only with South Slavic languages.

This can be found in Romanian, Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian.  In Albanian and Macedonian, this feature shows fully grammaticalized structures and is obligatory with indirect objects and to some extent with definite direct objects; in Bulgarian, however, it is optional and therefore based on discourse.  In Greek, the construction contrasts with the clitic-less construction and marks the cross-referenced object as a topic. Southwest Macedonia appears to be the location of innovation.{{Dubious|Dubious statement in \"Clitic pronouns\" section|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor example, \"I see George\" in Balkan languages:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Language\n!Example\n|-\n| Albanian\n|\"'''E''' shoh Gjergjin\"\n|-\n|Aromanian\n|\"'''U-''' ved Yioryi\"\n|-\n|Bulgarian\n|\"\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c '''\u0433\u043e''' \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438.\"\n|-\n|Macedonian\n|\"'''\u0413o''' \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0403\u043e\u0440\u0453\u0438.\"\n|-\n|Greek\n|\"'''\u03a4\u03bf\u03bd''' \u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\"\n|-\n| Romanian\n| \"'''\u00cel''' v\u0103d pe Gheorghe.\"\n|}\n\nNote: The neutral case in normal ([[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]]) word order is without a clitic: \"\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438.\" However, the form with an additional clitic pronoun is also perfectly normal and can be used for emphasis: \"\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043e \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438.\" And the clitic is obligatory in the case of a topicalized object (with OVS-word order), which serves also as the common colloquial equivalent of a passive construction. \"\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438 \u0433\u043e \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c.\"\n\n=====Adjectives=====\nThe replacement of synthetic adjectival comparative forms with analytic ones by means of preposed markers is common.  These markers are:\n*Bulgarian: ''\u043f\u043e-''\n* Macedonian: ''\u043f\u043e'' (prepended)\n*Albanian:  ''m\u00eb''\n*Romanian:  ''mai''\n*Modern Greek:  ''\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf'' (pi\u00f3)\n*Aromanian: ''(ca)ma''\n\nMacedonian and Modern Greek have retained some of the earlier synthetic forms. In Bulgarian and Macedonian these have become proper adjectives in their own right without the possibility of [further] comparison. This is more evident in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: ''\u0432\u0438\u0448'' = \"higher, superior\", ''\u043d\u0438\u0436'' = \"lower, inferior\". Compare with similar structures in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: ''\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0448(-(\u0438\u044f(\u0442))/\u0430(\u0442\u0430)/\u043e(\u0442\u043e)/\u0438(\u0442\u0435))'' = \"(the) higher, (the) superior\" (''\u043f\u043e-\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0448(-(\u0438\u044f(\u0442))/\u0430(\u0442\u0430)/\u043e(\u0442\u043e)/\u0438(\u0442\u0435))'' = \"(the) [more] higher, (the) [more] superior\"; '\u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0448(-(\u0438\u044f(\u0442))/\u043e(\u0442\u043e)/\u0430(\u0442\u0430)/\u0438(\u0442\u0435))' = \"(the) ([most]) highest, supreme\"; ''\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0448'' (also spelled as ''\u043d\u0438'''\u0437'''\u0448'' sometimes) = \"low, lower, inferior\", it can also possess further comparative or superlative as with '\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0448' above.\n\n=====Suffixes=====\nAlso, some common suffixes can be found in the language area, such as the diminutive suffix of the Slavic languages (Srb. Bul.

Several features are found across these languages though not all apply to every single language. The languages in question may belong to various separate branches of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (such as [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Hellenic languages|Greek]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]) or even outside of Indo-European (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]). Some of the languages use these features for their standard language (i.e. those whose homeland lies almost entirely within the region) whilst other populations to whom the land is not a cultural pivot (as they have wider communities outside of it) may still adopt the features for their local register.\n\nWhile some of these languages may share little vocabulary, their grammars have very extensive similarities; for example they have similar case systems, in those that have preserved [[grammatical case]]  and [[verb conjugation]] systems and have all become more [[Analytic language|analytic]], although to differing degrees.

[[Theodor Capidan]] went further, claiming that the structure of Balkan languages could be reduced to a standard language. Many of the earliest reports on this theory were in [[German language|German]], hence the term \"Balkansprachbund\" is often used as well.\n\n==Languages==\nThe languages that share these similarities belong to five distinct branches of the Indo-European languages:\n* [[Albanian language|Albanian]]\n* [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic]] ([[Greek language|Greek]])\n* [[Romance languages|Romance]] ([[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romance]] and [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]])\n* [[Balkan Slavic]] ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and the [[Prizren-Timok dialect]] of Serbian.)\n* [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ([[Romani language|Romani]])\n\nThe Finnish linguist [[Jouko Lindstedt]] computed in 2000 a \"Balkanization factor\" which gives each Balkan language a score proportional with the number of features shared in the Balkan language area.<ref name=\"langcontact\">{{cite book |last=Lindstedt |first=J. |year=2000 |chapter=Linguistic Balkanization: Contact-induced change by mutual reinforcement |pages=231\u2013246 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqQgBVXp_H4C |editor=D.G.

Score\n|-\n| Balkan Slavic\n| 11.5\n|-\n| Albanian\n| 10.5\n|-\n| Greek, Balkan Romance\n| 9.5\n|-\n| [[Balkan Romani]]\n| 7.5\n|}\n\nAnother language that may have been influenced by the Balkan language union is the [[Judaeo-Spanish]] variant that used to be spoken by [[Sephardi Jews]] living in the Balkans. The grammatical features shared (especially regarding the tense system) were most likely borrowed from Greek.\n\n==Origins==\nThe source of these features as well as the directions have long been debated, and various theories were suggested.\n\n===Thracian, Illyrian or Dacian and Albanian as successive language===\nSince most of these features cannot be found in languages related to those that belong to the language area (such as other Slavic or Romance languages),{{Dubious|date=March 2011}} early researchers, including Kopitar, believed they must have been inherited from the [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] (e.g. [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Dacian language|Dacian]]) which formed the [[Substratum|substrate]] for modern Balkan languages.  But since very little is known about Paleo-Balkan languages, it cannot be determined whether the features were present. The strongest candidate for a shared Paleo-Balkan feature is the postposed article. The Albanian language originates from one of these languages.\n\n===Greek===\nAnother theory, advanced by Kristian Sandfeld in 1930, was that these features were an entirely Greek influence, under the presumption that since Greece \"always had a superior civilization compared to its neighbours\", Greek could not have borrowed its linguistic features from them. However, no ancient dialects of Greek possessed Balkanisms, so that the features shared with other regional languages appear to be post-classical innovations. Also, Greek appears to be only peripheral to the Balkan language area, lacking some important features, such as the postposed article. Nevertheless, several of the features that Greek does share with the other languages (loss of dative, replacement of infinitive by subjunctive constructions, object clitics, formation of future with auxiliary verb \"to want\") probably originated in [[Medieval Greek]] and spread to the other languages through Byzantine influence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Horrocks|first1=Geoffrey|title=Greek: A History of the Language and its Speakers|date=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester|pages=227\u2013229|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n===Latin and Romance===\nThe Roman Empire ruled all the Balkans, and [[Common Romanian|local variation of Latin]] may have left its mark on all languages there, which were later the substrate to Slavic newcomers. This was proposed by [[Georg Solta]]. The weak point of this theory is that other Romance languages have few of the features, and there is no proof that the Balkan Romans were isolated for enough time to develop them. An argument for this would be the structural borrowings or \"linguistic [[calque]]s\" into Macedonian from Aromanian, which could be explained by Aromanian being a substrate of Macedonian, but this still does not explain the origin of these innovations in Aromanian. The analytic perfect with the auxiliary verb \"to have\" (which some Balkan languages share with Western European languages), is the only feature whose origin can fairly safely be traced to Latin.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Multiple sources===\nThe most commonly accepted theory, advanced by Polish scholar Zbigniew Go\u0142\u0105b, is that the innovations came from different sources and the languages influenced each other: some features can be traced from Latin, Slavic, or Greek languages, whereas others, particularly features that are shared only by Romanian, Albanian, Macedonian and Bulgarian, could be explained by the substratum kept after Romanization (in the case of Romanian) or Slavicization (in the case of Bulgarian). Albanian was influenced by both Latin and Slavic, but it kept many of its original characteristics.\n\nSeveral arguments favour this theory. First, throughout the turbulent [[history of the Balkans]], many groups of people moved to another place, inhabited by people of another ethnicity. These small groups were usually assimilated quickly and sometimes left marks in the new language they acquired. Second, the use of more than one language was common in the Balkans before the modern age, and a [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] in one language would quickly spread to other languages.  Third, the dialects that have the most \"balkanisms\" are those in regions where people had contact with people of many other languages.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Grammatical features===\n\n====Case system====\nThe number of cases is reduced, several cases being replaced with prepositions, the only exception being Serbo-Croatian. In [[Bulgarian grammar|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian grammar|Macedonian]], on the other hand, this development has actually led to the loss of all cases except the [[vocative case|vocative]].\n\nA common case system of a Balkan language is:\n\n* [[Nominative case|Nominative]]\n* [[Accusative case|Accusative]]\n* [[Dative case|Dative]] / [[Genitive case|Genitive]] ([[Syncretism (linguistics)|merged]])\n* [[Vocative case|Vocative]]\n\n=====Syncretism of genitive and dative=====\nIn the Balkan languages, the [[genitive case|genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]] cases (or corresponding prepositional constructions) undergo [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]].\n\n''Example:''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This feature is present to varying degrees in each language.  Decategoralization is less advanced in fossilized literary Romanian ''{{lang|ro|voi}}'' and in Serbo-Croatian ''{{lang|sh|\u0107u, \u0107e\u0161, \u0107e}}'', where the future marker is still an inflected auxiliary. In modern Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian, Aromanian, and spoken Romanian, decategoralization and erosion have given rise to an uninflected tense form, where the frozen third-person singular of the verb has turned into an invariable particle followed by the main verb inflected for person (compare Rom 1.sg. ''{{lang|ro|voi}}'', 2.sg. ''{{lang|ro|vei}}'', 3.sg. ''{{lang|ro|va}}'' > invariable ''{{lang|ro|va}}'' > mod.

Unlike the avoidance of the infinitive, which had already come to encompass all Romani varieties before many of them were brought out of the Balkans into the rest of Europe, the formation of the future tense with a devolitive particle is apparently a later development, since it is only seen in those dialect groups that have not left the Balkans.</ref>\n| ''{{lang|rom|ka}}'' (inv.) + subjunctive\n| ''{{lang|rom|Ka dikhav}}''\n|}\n\n=====Analytic perfect tense=====\nThe analytic perfect tense is formed in the Balkan languages with the verb \"to have\" and, usually, a past passive participle, similarly to the construction found in Germanic and other Romance languages: e.g. Romanian ''{{lang|ro|am promis}}'' \"I have promised\", Albanian ''{{lang|sq|kam premtuar}}'' \"I have promised\". A somewhat less typical case of this is Greek, where the verb \"to have\" is followed by the so-called {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf}} ('invariant form', historically the aorist infinitive): {{lang|el|\u03ad\u03c7\u03c9 \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b8\u03b5\u03af}}. However, a completely different construction is used in Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian, which have inherited from Common Slavic an analytic perfect formed with the verb \"to be\" and the past ''active'' participle: {{lang|bg|\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043b \u0441\u044a\u043c}}, ''{{lang|bg-Latn|obe\u0161tal s\u01cem}}'' (Bul.) / {{lang|sr|\u043e\u0431\u0435\u045b\u0430\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c}}, ''{{lang|sr|obe\u0107ao sam}}'' (Ser.) - \"I have promised\" (lit. \"I am having-promised\"). On the other hand, Macedonian, the third Slavic language in the sprachbund, is like Romanian and Albanian in that it uses quite typical Balkan constructions consisting of the verb ''to have'' and a past passive participle ({{lang|mk|\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e}}, ''{{lang|mk-Latn|imam veteno}}'' = \"I have promised\"). Macedonian also has a perfect formed with the verb \"to be\", like Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian.\n\n=====Renarrative mood=====\nThe so-called [[Inferential mood#Renarrative in the Balkan languages|renarrative mood]] is another shared feature of the Balkan languages, including Turkish. It is used for statements that are not based on direct observation or common knowledge, but repeat what was reported by others. For example, \u041f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442 '''\u0431\u0438\u043b''' \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d in Macedonian means \"The road was closed (or so I heard)\". A speaker who uses the [[indicative mood]] instead and states \"\u041f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442 '''\u0431\u0435\u0448\u0435''' \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\" implies thereby that they personally witnessed the road's closure.\n\n=====Avoidance or loss of infinitive=====\nThe use of the infinitive (common in other languages related to some of the Balkan languages, such as Romance and Slavic) is generally replaced with subjunctive constructions, following early Greek innovation.\n\n* in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Tosk Albanian, the loss of the infinitive is complete\n* in [[Demotic Greek|demotic]] (vernacular) Greek, the loss of the infinitive was complete, whereas in literary Greek (''[[Katharevousa]]'', abolished in 1976) it was not; the natural fusion of the vernacular with ''Katharevousa'' resulted in the creation of the contemporary common Greek (Modern Standard Greek), where the infinitive, when used, is principally used as noun (e.g. {{lang|el|\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} \"speaking, fluency, eloquence\", {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} \"writing\", {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9}} \"being\", etc.) deriving directly from the ancient Greek infinitive formation. But its substitution by the subjunctive form when the infinitive would be used as a verb is complete. Most of the times, the subjunctive form substitutes the infinitive also in the cases when it would be used as a noun (e.g. {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c2}} / {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2}} \"to go, the act of going\", {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}} / {{lang|el|\u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}} \"to see/be seeing, the act of seeing\" instead of the infinitive \"{{lang|el|\u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}}\", etc.)\n* in Aromanian and Southern Serbo-Croatian dialects, it is almost complete\n* in Gheg Albanian and Megleno-Romanian, it is used only in a limited number of expressions\n* in standard Romanian (prepositional phrase: ''{{lang|ro|a}}'' + verb stem) and Serbo-Croatian, the infinitive shares many of its functions with the subjunctive. In these two languages, the infinitive will always be found in dictionaries and language textbooks. However, in Romanian, the inherited infinitive form (''{{lang|ro|-are}}'', ''{{lang|ro|-ere}}'', and ''{{lang|ro|-ire}}'') is now used only as a verbal noun.\n* Turkish as spoken in [[Sliven]] and [[Shumen|\u0160umen]] has also almost completely lost the infinitive, but not verbal nouns using the same grammatical form. This is clearly due to the influence of the Balkan sprachbund.\n\nFor example, \"I want to write\" in several Balkan languages:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Language\n! Example\n!

Some varieties outside the Balkans have been influenced by non-Balkan languages and have developed new infinitives by generalizing one of the finite forms (e.g. Slovak Romani varieties may express \"I want to write\" as ''{{lang|rom|kamav '''te irinel/pisinel'''}}'' \u2014 generalized third person singular \u2014 or ''{{lang|rom|kamav '''te irinen/pisinen'''}}'' \u2014 generalized third person plural).\n|}\nBut here is an example of a relict form, preserved in Bulgarian:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This can be found in Romanian, Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian.  In Albanian and Macedonian, this feature shows fully grammaticalized structures and is obligatory with indirect objects and to some extent with definite direct objects; in Bulgarian, however, it is optional and therefore based on discourse.  In Greek, the construction contrasts with the clitic-less construction and marks the cross-referenced object as a topic. Southwest Macedonia appears to be the location of innovation.{{Dubious|Dubious statement in \"Clitic pronouns\" section|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor example, \"I see George\" in Balkan languages:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Language\n!Example\n|-\n| Albanian\n|\"'''E''' shoh Gjergjin\"\n|-\n|Aromanian\n|\"'''U-''' ved Yioryi\"\n|-\n|Bulgarian\n|\"\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c '''\u0433\u043e''' \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438.\"\n|-\n|Macedonian\n|\"'''\u0413o''' \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0403\u043e\u0440\u0453\u0438.\"\n|-\n|Greek\n|\"'''\u03a4\u03bf\u03bd''' \u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\"\n|-\n| Romanian\n| \"'''\u00cel''' v\u0103d pe Gheorghe.\"\n|}\n\nNote: The neutral case in normal ([[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]]) word order is without a clitic: \"\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438.\" However, the form with an additional clitic pronoun is also perfectly normal and can be used for emphasis: \"\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043e \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438.\" And the clitic is obligatory in the case of a topicalized object (with OVS-word order), which serves also as the common colloquial equivalent of a passive construction. \"\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438 \u0433\u043e \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043c.\"\n\n=====Adjectives=====\nThe replacement of synthetic adjectival comparative forms with analytic ones by means of preposed markers is common.  These markers are:\n*Bulgarian: ''\u043f\u043e-''\n* Macedonian: ''\u043f\u043e'' (prepended)\n*Albanian:  ''m\u00eb''\n*Romanian:  ''mai''\n*Modern Greek:  ''\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf'' (pi\u00f3)\n*Aromanian: ''(ca)ma''\n\nMacedonian and Modern Greek have retained some of the earlier synthetic forms. In Bulgarian and Macedonian these have become proper adjectives in their own right without the possibility of [further] comparison. This is more evident in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: ''\u0432\u0438\u0448'' = \"higher, superior\", ''\u043d\u0438\u0436'' = \"lower, inferior\". Compare with similar structures in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: ''\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0448(-(\u0438\u044f(\u0442))/\u0430(\u0442\u0430)/\u043e(\u0442\u043e)/\u0438(\u0442\u0435))'' = \"(the) higher, (the) superior\" (''\u043f\u043e-\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0448(-(\u0438\u044f(\u0442))/\u0430(\u0442\u0430)/\u043e(\u0442\u043e)/\u0438(\u0442\u0435))'' = \"(the) [more] higher, (the) [more] superior\"; '\u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0448(-(\u0438\u044f(\u0442))/\u043e(\u0442\u043e)/\u0430(\u0442\u0430)/\u0438(\u0442\u0435))' = \"(the) ([most]) highest, supreme\"; ''\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0448'' (also spelled as ''\u043d\u0438'''\u0437'''\u0448'' sometimes) = \"low, lower, inferior\", it can also possess further comparative or superlative as with '\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0448' above.\n\n=====Suffixes=====\nAlso, some common suffixes can be found in the language area, such as the diminutive suffix of the Slavic languages (Srb. Bul. Mac.) \"-ovo\" \"-ica\" that can be found in Albanian, Greek and Romanian.\n\n===Vocabulary===\n\n====Loanwords====\nSeveral hundred words are common to the Balkan union languages; the origin of most of them is either [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] or [[Turkish language|Turkish]], as the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] and later the [[Ottoman Empire]] directly controlled the territory throughout most of its history, strongly influencing its culture and economics.\n\nAlbanian, Aromanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian also share a large number of words of various origins:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This came right after Trump attended a discussion where his senior health official [[Anthony Fauci]] told him it would actually take \"a year to a year and a half\" (at a minimum, Fauci later said). During that discussion, Trump repeatedly quizzed the leaders of pharmaceutical companies on the time needed to produce vaccines, stating: \"I like the sound of a couple of months better\".

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\". However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.

This came right after Trump attended a discussion where his senior health official [[Anthony Fauci]] told him it would actually take \"a year to a year and a half\" (at a minimum, Fauci later said). During that discussion, Trump repeatedly quizzed the leaders of pharmaceutical companies on the time needed to produce vaccines, stating: \"I like the sound of a couple of months better\".

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\". However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.

For example, in arid zones, once [[forest cover]] is destroyed, the land may become dry and inhospitable for the growth of new trees.  Other factors include [[overgrazing]] by [[livestock]], especially animals such as [[goat]]s, [[cow]]s, and [[over-harvesting]] of forest resources. Together these may lead to [[desertification]] and the loss of [[topsoil]]; without soil, forests cannot grow until the long process of soil creation has been completed - if [[erosion]] allows this. In some tropical areas, forest cover removal may result in a [[duricrust]] or [[duripan]] that effectively seal off the soil to water penetration and root growth.  In many areas, reforestation is impossible because people are using the land. In other areas, mechanical breaking up of duripans or duricrusts is necessary, careful and continued watering may be essential, and special protection, such as fencing, may be needed.\n\n== Forests to attract rain ==\nSeveral new studies suggest that forests attract rain and this may explain why drought is occurring more frequently in parts of the world such as western Africa. A new study by Carol Rasmussen,\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory gives the first observational evidence that the southern Amazon rain forest triggers its own rainy season using water vapor from plant leaves. The finding helps explain why [[deforestation]] in this region is linked with reduced rainfall.<ref>Carol Rasmussen (2017), New study shows the Amazon makes its own rainy season, \nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, \n https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2608/new-study-shows-the-amazon-makes-its-own-rainy-season/</ref> A study by Douglas Sheil and Daniel Murdiyarso hypothesises that forest cover plays a much greater role in determining rainfall than previously recognized.

In the 1800s people moving westward encountered the Great Plains \u2013 land with fertile soil, a growing population and a demand for timber but with few trees to supply it. So tree planting was encouraged along homesteads. [[Arbor Day]] was founded in 1872 by [[Julius Sterling Morton]] in Nebraska City, Nebraska. By the 1930s the [[Dust Bowl]] environmental disaster signified a reason for significant new tree cover. Public works programs under the New Deal saw the planting of 18,000 miles of [[windbreak]]s stretching from North Dakota to Texas to fight soil erosion (see [[Great Plains Shelterbelt]]).\n\nAt their summit in Copenhagen in 2009, organised by the UK based The Climate Group, leaders of subnational governments \u2013 states, regions and provinces \u2013 unanimously supported a recommendation by Premier Rann to plant one billion trees across their varied jurisdictions.  The initiative was strongly supported by leaders present including Quebec Premier [[Jean Charest]], California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and Scottish First Minister [[Alex Salmond]].  At a subsequent meeting in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012, The Climate Group announced that it had already received commitments by member governments to plant more than 500 million trees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theclimategroup.org/climate-group|title=We work to accelerate climate action|date=18 May 2016|website=The Climate Group}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nThe use of afforestation as strategy of conservation of forest biomes is seen as a menace to the conservation of natural [[grassland]] and [[savanna]] biomes, as the ideal would be the [[reforestation]] of areas where forest occurs naturally.<ref>Veldman, J.W., Overbeck, G.E., Negreiros, D., Mahy, G., Le Stradic, S., Durigan, G., Buisson, E., Putz, F.E. & Bond, W.J.

For example, in arid zones, once [[forest cover]] is destroyed, the land may become dry and inhospitable for the growth of new trees.  Other factors include [[overgrazing]] by [[livestock]], especially animals such as [[goat]]s, [[cow]]s, and [[over-harvesting]] of forest resources. Together these may lead to [[desertification]] and the loss of [[topsoil]]; without soil, forests cannot grow until the long process of soil creation has been completed - if [[erosion]] allows this. In some tropical areas, forest cover removal may result in a [[duricrust]] or [[duripan]] that effectively seal off the soil to water penetration and root growth.  In many areas, reforestation is impossible because people are using the land. In other areas, mechanical breaking up of duripans or duricrusts is necessary, careful and continued watering may be essential, and special protection, such as fencing, may be needed.\n\n== Forests to attract rain ==\nSeveral new studies suggest that forests attract rain and this may explain why drought is occurring more frequently in parts of the world such as western Africa. A new study by Carol Rasmussen,\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory gives the first observational evidence that the southern Amazon rain forest triggers its own rainy season using water vapor from plant leaves. The finding helps explain why [[deforestation]] in this region is linked with reduced rainfall.<ref>Carol Rasmussen (2017), New study shows the Amazon makes its own rainy season, \nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, \n https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2608/new-study-shows-the-amazon-makes-its-own-rainy-season/</ref> A study by Douglas Sheil and Daniel Murdiyarso hypothesises that forest cover plays a much greater role in determining rainfall than previously recognized.

The funds can be used for treatment of catchment areas, assisted natural generation, forest management, wildlife protection and management, relocation of villages from protected areas, managing human-wildlife conflicts, training and awareness generation, supply of wood saving devices and allied activities. Increasing the tree cover would help in creating additional carbon sink to meet the nation's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by the year 2030 - part of India's efforts to combat climate change.\nThe [[Maharashtra]] government planted almost 20,000,000 saplings in the entire state, and will pledge to plant another 30,000,000 next year. According to The Telegraph, the Indian government has attributed $6.2 billion for tree-planting in order to increase \u201cforestation in line with agreements made at the Paris climate change summit in 2015.\u201d The Indian government has also passed the CAMPA ([[CAMPA bill|Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority]]) law, which will allow about 40 thousand crores rupees (almost $6 Billion) will go to Indian states for planting trees.\n\n===Iran===\nIran is considered a low forest cover region of the world with present cover approximating seven percent of the land area. This is a value reduced by an estimated six million hectares of virgin forest, which includes [[oak]], [[almond]] and [[pistachio]].<ref name=\"Stanturf\">J.A.Stanturf, 2004</ref>  Due to soil substrates, it is difficult to achieve afforestation on a large scale compared to other temperate areas endowed with more fertile and less rocky and arid soil conditions.<ref name=\"Stanturf\"/>  Consequently, most of the afforestation is conducted with non-native species,<ref name=\"Stanturf\"/> leading to [[habitat destruction]] for native [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and resulting in an accelerated [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]].<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Israel===\n[[File:Jewish National Fund trees in The Negev.jpg|thumb|JNF trees in the [[Negev Desert]].

The $8-billion project intends to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land by 2030.\n\nAlso in North Africa, the [[Sahara Forest Project]] coupled with the [[Seawater greenhouse]] has been proposed. Some projects have also been launched in countries as [[Senegal]] to revert desertification. As of 2010, African leaders are discussing the combining of national resources to increase effectiveness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afriqueavenir.org/en/2010/06/17/african-leaders-discuss-great-green-wall-project-in-chadian-capital/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718235403/http://www.afriqueavenir.org/en/2010/06/17/african-leaders-discuss-great-green-wall-project-in-chadian-capital/ |archivedate=2010-07-18 |title=Combining of green walls |publisher=Afriqueavenir.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> In addition, other projects as the [[Keita Integrated Development Project|Keita Project]] in Niger have been launched in the past, and have been able to locally revert damage done by [[desertification]].

So for readability the process is all described in the [[reforestation]] article.\n\n===United States===\nThe United States is roughly one-third covered in forest and woodland.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Nevertheless, areas in the US were subject to significant tree planting. In the 1800s people moving westward encountered the Great Plains \u2013 land with fertile soil, a growing population and a demand for timber but with few trees to supply it. So tree planting was encouraged along homesteads. [[Arbor Day]] was founded in 1872 by [[Julius Sterling Morton]] in Nebraska City, Nebraska. By the 1930s the [[Dust Bowl]] environmental disaster signified a reason for significant new tree cover. Public works programs under the New Deal saw the planting of 18,000 miles of [[windbreak]]s stretching from North Dakota to Texas to fight soil erosion (see [[Great Plains Shelterbelt]]).\n\nAt their summit in Copenhagen in 2009, organised by the UK based The Climate Group, leaders of subnational governments \u2013 states, regions and provinces \u2013 unanimously supported a recommendation by Premier Rann to plant one billion trees across their varied jurisdictions.  The initiative was strongly supported by leaders present including Quebec Premier [[Jean Charest]], California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and Scottish First Minister [[Alex Salmond]].  At a subsequent meeting in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012, The Climate Group announced that it had already received commitments by member governments to plant more than 500 million trees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theclimategroup.org/climate-group|title=We work to accelerate climate action|date=18 May 2016|website=The Climate Group}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nThe use of afforestation as strategy of conservation of forest biomes is seen as a menace to the conservation of natural [[grassland]] and [[savanna]] biomes, as the ideal would be the [[reforestation]] of areas where forest occurs naturally.<ref>Veldman, J.W., Overbeck, G.E., Negreiros, D., Mahy, G., Le Stradic, S., Durigan, G., Buisson, E., Putz, F.E. & Bond, W.J.
