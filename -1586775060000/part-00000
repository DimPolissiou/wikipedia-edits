He serves as the primary [[antagonist]] of the first half of the first ''[[BioShock]]'' and a minor character in its sequel, ''[[BioShock 2]]'' and its prequel, ''[[BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea]]''. Ryan is portrayed as an idealistic [[business magnate]] in the 1940s and 1950s; seeking to avoid scrutiny from governments and other oversight, he ordered the secret construction of an underwater city, [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]]. When civil war sees Ryan's vision for a utopia in Rapture collapse into [[dystopia]], he descends into reclusiveness and paranoia. After his victory in the war, he becomes increasingly ruthless in his control over the remaining inhabitants of the city.\n\nRyan was created by [[Irrational Games]]' [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]], based on figures like [[Ayn Rand]], [[Howard Hughes]],<ref name=\"rockpapershotgun\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2007/08/20/exclusive-ken-levine-on-the-making-of-bioshock/|title=Exclusive: Ken Levine on the making of Bioshock|last=Gillen|first=Kieron|date=20 August 2007|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|accessdate=2 December 2018| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091009131020/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2007/08/20/exclusive-ken-levine-on-the-making-of-bioshock/| archivedate= 9 October 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Charles Foster Kane]], and [[Walt Disney]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The character has received significant praise from critics, with ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' ranking him ninth on their list of top ten video game politicians.<ref name=\"Scott Sharkey 2008\">Scott Sharkey, \"''EGM'''s Top Ten Videogame Politicians: Election time puts us in a voting mood,\u201d ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' 234 (November 2008): 97.</ref> He is voiced by [[Armin Shimerman]], whose voice acting was cited as one of the contributing factors to the success of ''BioShock'' as it won \"Best Use of Sound\" from [[IGN]]. Ryan has been compared to several different real-life and fictional figures, and his world of Rapture compared to the world of [[Galt's Gulch]] in the Ayn Rand novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n''[[BioShock]]'' director Ken Levine described Andrew Ryan as a character of ideals, in contrast to the game's other antagonist, Frank Fontaine, who has no ideals. Designing the encounter between the player and Ryan was a controversial decision for the developers, due to the question of what the player's motive is at this point. Ryan taking his own life to prevent Jack, the protagonist, from accomplishing this, was described as the \"ultimate insult\" by Levine. The scene took a long time for the developers to finish. Levine stated that they figured out who the character of Andrew Ryan is too early, adding that they underestimated the impact that this would make.<ref name=\"gamasutra2\">{{cite web |title=GDC: Ken Levine Speaks: Empowering Players to Care About Your Stupid Story |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17531 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=13 October 2009 |date=20 February 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091016194454/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17531| archivedate= 16 October 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> While he is saner than the opponents the players encounter before him, including a plastic surgeon who takes his ideal of beauty too far, he is as unmovable as they are, unwilling to change his ideals.

Following this, he created the character of Ryan as its creator, giving him a \"pseudo-[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivism]] and extremely [[capitalistic]] view on the world\" as well as a fear of the [[New Deal]]ers in the United States and communists in Russia would find it. Levine states that to him, Ryan's philosophies come from [[Art Deco]], describing the style as, \"Yes, we are men, and we control the universe!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/bioshock/799226p1.html|title=Rationalizing Rapture with BioShock's Ken Levine|date=25 June 2007|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=10 October 2009}}</ref> He considered Ryan a combination of historical figures such as [[Howard Hughes]] and [[Ayn Rand]]; and, though he compared Ryan to [[John Galt]], he considered Ryan  more similar to a real person, making mistakes and having fear and doubts.<ref name=\"rockpapershotgun\" /> Levine purposely named Ryan as he did, using a semi-anagram of Ayn Rand's name to establish the connection.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2012/12/13/bioshock-infinites-ken-levine-of-sounds-and-pixels/ | title = BioShock Infinite's Ken Levine: of sounds and pixels | publisher = [[VG247]] | first = Stace | last = Harmen | date = 13 December 2012 | accessdate = 17 December 2012 }}</ref> During a questions and answers segment, a questioner stated that he did not want to kill Ryan, asking Levine, \"Are [we] still doomed to make games where we have to use plot devices to clean that up?\" to which Levine responded that video games were admittedly linear, saying that it was hard enough to come up with one good plot, let alone multiple ones.<ref name=\"gamasutra2\"/> Levine stated that he did not expect the \"ugly comedown from the stratospheric highs\" from the Andrew Ryan scene near the end.<ref>{{cite web |title=Opinion: When Should Games Say Goodbye? |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19388 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=13 October 2009 |date=21 July 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091109093255/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19388| archivedate= 9 November 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==Role in ''BioShock''==\nThe player only encounters Ryan once in person throughout the entire [[BioShock (series)|''BioShock'' franchise]], with most of his appearance being made via [[radio transmission]] and [[Diary#Audio journals|audio diaries]].

Fontaine/Atlas was again forced into hiding. By this point however, the city had become a [[dystopia]]. Ryan descended into paranoia, withdrawing from society and ruling over the remaining populace as an increasingly ruthless [[tyrant]].<ref>{{cite video game|title=BioShock|developer=Irrational Games|publisher=2K Games|date=21 August 2007|platform=Xbox 360/Microsoft Windows|version=|level=|isolang=|quote='''Andrew Ryan''': So tell me, friend, which one of the bitches sent you?

Ryan attempts to do whatever possible to kill Jack, who is guided through Rapture by Fontaine, still disguised as Atlas. Over the course of the game it is gradually revealed to the player that Jack is actually Andrew Ryan's illegitimate son. Year's prior, in 1956, Ryan had sex with a young female stripper named Jasmine Jolene, resulting in her pregnancy, although Ryan was not aware of this. Fontaine, taking advantage of this opportunity, paid a high-ranking employee of his, Brigid Tenenbaum, to purchase the embryo from her. After Ryan became aware of this, he brutally murdered Jolene. The child was named Jack and Fontaine ordered a scientist under his employment, Dr. Yi Suchong to accelerate Jack's growth, and make him vulnerable to several mental techniques; one such technique was to force Jack to perform any requested action upon hearing the phrase \"Would you kindly?\" Jack, aged 2, already an adult at this point as a result of the genetic acceleration, was sent to live on the surface.

As Jack and Ryan shared the same genes, Jack would be able to bypass much of Rapture's genetic-based security. The package at the beginning of the game is revealed to be a gun, \"Would you kindly..?\" can be seen written on the accompanying note, sent by Fontaine, ordering Jack to hijack and crash the plane at the coordinates of the city.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nWhen Andrew Ryan and Jack finally meet, Ryan states that Jack was his \"greatest disappointment.\" Ryan gives a short [[monologue]], revealing Jack's true past to him, and saying how little he differs from a slave. According to Ryan, \"In the end, what separates a man from a slave? Money? Power? No. A man chooses, a slave obeys.\" Ryan hands Jack his golf [[putter (golf)|putter]], and then asks Jack, using the \"Would you kindly?\" phrase, to kill him, mockingly ordering him to \"obey\", which Jack is forced to do.<ref name=\"BioShock\"/>\n\n===''BioShock 2''===\nRyan also appears in ''BioShock's'' sequel, ''[[BioShock 2]]'', largely through audio diaries, which give the player an expanded insight into Ryan's history and ideals.

Ryan attempts to do whatever possible to kill Jack, who is guided through Rapture by Fontaine, still disguised as Atlas. Over the course of the game it is gradually revealed to the player that Jack is actually Andrew Ryan's illegitimate son. Year's prior, in 1956, Ryan had sex with a young female stripper named Jasmine Jolene, resulting in her pregnancy, although Ryan was not aware of this. Fontaine, taking advantage of this opportunity, paid a high-ranking employee of his, Brigid Tenenbaum, to purchase the embryo from her. After Ryan became aware of this, he brutally murdered Jolene. The child was named Jack and Fontaine ordered a scientist under his employment, Dr. Yi Suchong to accelerate Jack's growth, and make him vulnerable to several mental techniques; one such technique was to force Jack to perform any requested action upon hearing the phrase \"Would you kindly?\" Jack, aged 2, already an adult at this point as a result of the genetic acceleration, was sent to live on the surface.

As Jack and Ryan shared the same genes, Jack would be able to bypass much of Rapture's genetic-based security.
