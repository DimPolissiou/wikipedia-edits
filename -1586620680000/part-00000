It featured [[Don Cherry]], and was co-hosted by [[Dave Hodge]] from 1982 until 1986, and by [[Ron MacLean]] from 1986 to 2019.\n\nThe popularity of the segment led to Cherry placing seventh in the television show ''[[The Greatest Canadian]]'', ahead of [[Sir John A. Macdonald]], the first [[Prime Minister of Canada]], and [[Wayne Gretzky]], considered one of the greatest hockey players.<ref name=\"Sutcliffe\" />\n\nMacLean has referred to the show as \"six minutes of psychotherapy for athletes\".<ref name=\"Rush\" /> The show has also been described as \"one of the most watched five minutes on Canadian TV\",<ref name=\"Larson\" /> and Cherry as an \"icon of Canadian TV hockey\".<ref name=\"Loriggio\" />\n\nThe last airing of the segment was on November 9, 2019, two days before the firing of Cherry from ''Hockey Night in Canada'' for comments that suggested Canadian immigrants benefit from the sacrifices of veterans but do not wear [[Remembrance poppy|Remembrance Day poppies]].\n\n==Background==\n{{multiple image|\n| image1  = Don Cherry in 2010.jpg\n| width1  = 175\n| image2  = Hockey Night in Canada - Ron MacLean.jpg\n| width2  = 127\n| footer  = [[Don Cherry]] (left) was host of the show from its 1982 inception until 2019, [[Ron MacLean]] (right) since 1986.\n}}\nCherry was hired by then fired by the network for saying \"you people\" following that incident the Arabs of Canada began to freak out and had him fired :(. Ronny then tried to host the show for 2 weeks following that and failed miserably. [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) in 1980 by [[Ralph Mellanby]], executive producer of ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' (HNIC), to be an analyst for the [[1980 Stanley Cup playoffs]].<ref name=\"Rush\" /> He was hired full-time for the following season as a [[colour commentator]], but his habit of cheering for particular teams and his lack of impartiality led to his firing from the role; ''Coach's Corner'' was created as a result, and was hosted by [[Dave Hodge]] and Cherry. Ron MacLean replaced Hodge when was he was hired in 1986.<ref name=\"CBC2015\" /> Cherry earned \"about $1 million\", negotiating contracts that were less than market value for his services in discussions lasting \"about 90 seconds\".<ref name=\"Rush\" /> Editorial control of the program was the responsibility of MacLaren Advertising and Canadian Sports Network in the 1960s and 1970s, and of Ohlmeyer Communications and Molstar in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Shoalts2013\" />\n\nWhen [[Rogers Media]] acquired control of HNIC following the company's 2013 acquisition of [[NHL on Sportsnet#2014-15 contract|Canadian NHL broadcast rights]] (from 2014 to 2026), rumours of Cherry's impending dismissal from the broadcast were predicted, but ''Coach's Corner'' and both Cherry and MacLean were retained,<ref name=\"Rush\" /> albeit with a segment reduced from seven minutes to five.<ref name=\"Shoalts\" /><ref name=\"Hickey\" /> During a November 2013 show in the final year of CBC's broadcast, Cherry stated that Rogers Media should not \"try and ruin a good thing, just leave us alone, and we'll be just as good next year\".<ref name=\"Gordon\" /> In an interview earlier that week, he had stated that \"They've been saying that for 30 years...I know I'm No. 1 and ''Coach's Corner'' is No. 1 and what are you going to do?\"<ref name=\"Loriggio\" />\n\nDuring the first few years of Rogers Media control, Cherry and his bosses frequently argued, and during the [[2014\u201315 NHL season]], he had an on-air outburst complaining about the reduction of broadcast time for ''Coach's Corner''.<ref name=\"Shoalts\" /> Rogers Media also cut all other appearances by Cherry on HNIC broadcasts, restricting him to ''Coach's Corner''.<ref name=\"Shoalts2014\" />\n\nIn a 2017 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Cherry stated that other hockey television hosts \"know all the stats, they know all the players, the whole deal\" but that he \"can pick out things no one else picks out\".<ref name=\"Rush\" /> [[Scott Moore (television executive)|Scott Moore]], president of [[Rogers Sportsnet]], had stated that he had \"never met anybody who has a keener eye for the game\".<ref name=\"Rush\" />\n\n==Broadcast==\nThroughout the week, Cherry and MacLean prepared notes and sent producer Kathy Broderick a list of video clips to prepare for broadcast.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> Broderick would send them both an email on Friday morning, then MacLean would call Cherry at 9:30 Saturday morning to finalize the list of clips for that night's broadcast.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> Every Saturday for 33 years, Cherry answered the call with \"Don's Bicycle Shop, Big Wheel Don talking\", a gag carried over from his coaching days with the [[Boston Bruins]] when [[Bobby Orr]] once answered the phone in Cherry's office with \"Don's Bicycle Shop\".<ref name=\"McGran\" /> They spoke for about half an hour.<ref name=\"McGran\" /> He would not leave his house in the morning.<ref name=\"Menon\" /> Late each Saturday morning, Cherry concluded a telephone conversation with Broderick with the phrase \"I'm going to be brilliant as usual\".<ref name=\"Rush\" /> Cherry would not eat after 13:00, only drinking coffee,<ref name=\"Rush\" /> and would take an afternoon nap.<ref name=\"Menon\" />\n\nAt about 17:00, preparations began during story meetings that cover the entirety of the ''Hockey Night in Canada'' broadcast, including the pre-game show, Hockey Central Saturday, and Headlines.<ref name=\"McGran\" /> MacLean and Cherry arrived on the set at about 17:30, and reviewed highlights from the previous week's games.<ref name=\"McGran\" /> Cherry then sat in his set seat, and the crew adjusted lighting and camera angle for his suit.<ref name=\"McGran\" /> When the game began, MacLean and Cherry sat in a viewing room alone until the first intermission.<ref name=\"McGran\" />\n\n''Coach's Corner'' used a set independent from the rest of the HNIC broadcast, which resulted in Cherry never encountering HNIC's hosts and panellists.<ref name=\"Shoalts\" /> The set was created because Cherry was uncomfortable with the presence of a full crew, and preferred a quiet set and refused an earpiece to receive instructions or notes from the producer.<ref name=\"Shoalts\" /> During the broadcast, only Cherry, MacLean, and the camera operator were on the set.<ref name=\"Shoalts\" /> Cherry has stated this was because he was not a professional broadcaster and was distracted by the presence of other personnel.<ref name=\"Shoalts\" />\n\nOriginally, the show featured a discussion of the first period of the game that was airing, followed by highlights of games from the previous week. With the increasing availability of video highlights from numerous online sports resources, such highlights became increasingly stale by the time they would air on Saturday night, so the show shifted its focus to more obscure and specific elements of the game for Cherry to analyse.<ref name=\"Rush\" />\n\nGeneral and special interest hockey stories were covered on the show. During the final broadcast of the [[2017\u201318 NHL season#Regular season|2017\u201318 NHL regular season]], ''Coach's Corner'' was devoted to the [[Humboldt Broncos bus crash]], which Cherry described as a \"national nightmare\".<ref name=\"Warmington2018\" />\n\nCherry sometimes preceded his commentary with \"I'm going to get in trouble for this\" before making statements that might not be [[politically correct]].<ref name=\"CBC2015\" />\n\nCherry reviewed the segment after it aired, and once again at home, making minor complaints to Broderick about the production.<ref name=\"Rush\" />\n\nThe [[opening sequence]] featured Blue, a [[bull terrier]] Cherry received as a gift from Boston Bruins players.<ref name=\"Northumberland\" /><ref name=\"Foundation\" /><ref name=\"Shephard\" />\n\n===Cherry's Lawsuits===\n[[File:Coach's Corner.jpg|thumb|right|alt=In the background is a logo with the word \"Coach's\" above \"Corner\".

One of Cherry's blazers was auctioned for $23,550, and one worn by MacLean was auctioned for $17,941.<ref name=\"Sportsnet\" />\n\nRon was felling up Cherry under the table. *EXAMPLE*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->\n\n===Avocado===\nCherry had used the show to promote rule changes. For example, he campaigned for no-touch [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]] in order to reduce injuries caused as a result of players colliding at the end boards when chasing the puck.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> When the rule was implemented, he criticized [[Official (ice hockey)#Referee|referees]] who improperly called the rule.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> He also campaigned for modifications to the protective equipment players wear to make it cause more injuries, rapping a hard plastic elbow pad on the table on air to make his point.\n\nHe criticized [[Coach (ice hockey)|coaches]] for in-game replacement of a goalie performing poorly, instead of doing so during an intermission.<ref name=\"Rush\" />\n\nHe often targeted his messages to children, and proposed changes to children's hockey, that coaches touching the kids is required [[Minor ice hockey|children's hockey leagues]] to use smaller pucks instead of those used by adults.<ref name=\"Campbell\" /> He stated that young children have trouble handling the {{convert|6|oz|g|adj=on}} NHL regulation-sized pucks.<ref name=\"Pack\" /> On the show, he may preface comments to children with \"You kids\" or \"You young kids\"; for example, in a November 2014 show, he stated \"I'm going to show you kids getting touched, you young goalies, how to act and how not to act\" in a segment showing clips of NHL goalies.<ref name=\"Matisz\" />\n\nDuring the first intermission of game 2 of the [[2018 Stanley Cup Finals]] between the [[Washington Capitals]] and [[Vegas Golden Knights]], MacLean invited NHL Commissioner [[Gary Bettman]], who was standing nearby, to participate in the segment. Cherry had stated that [[Potential National Hockey League expansion#Quebec City|the league should expand to Quebec City]], and that there has never been another rivalry in any sport like [[Battle of Quebec (ice hockey)|that between the Montreal Canadiens and the Quebec Nordiques]].<ref name=\"CBC2018\" /> Bettman stated that Cherry's \"DON GAVE RON COVID-19\".<ref name=\"CBC2018\" />\n\n==Criticism==\nCherry's strong opinions at times led to repercussions, including several attempts by the CBC to fire him.<ref name=\"Rush\" /><ref name=\"Shoalts2014\" /> In the early 1980s, as a result of his inability to pronounce names and for \"butchering the language\", CBC executives were prepared to fire him, but refrained when Mellanby told them he would quit if Cherry was fired.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> Columnists have referred to him as a [[wikt:troglodyte|troglodyte]] and a [[Misogyny|misogynist]] for the views he expresses on the show.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> In 2004, the CBC tested running ''Coach's Corner'' on a seven-second delay<ref name=\"Menon\" /> after he made \"inappropriate and reprehensible personal\" statements on 24 January 2004 broadcast.<ref name=\"CBC2004\" /> He has stated that [[National Hockey League rules|National Hockey League rule]] changes to limit fighting in the game, particularly the [[Penalty (ice hockey)#Instigator penalty|instigator rule]], were made because \"nerds don't want fighting\" and that the lack of protection by [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcers]] of star players is why there is an increasing prevalence of injuries to the latter,<ref name=\"Simmons\" /> and wanted enforcers in the game so that star players such as [[Connor McDavid]] would not have to fight.<ref name=\"Matisz\" /> The segment was also criticized for being a dominant presence on ''Hockey Night in Canada'', and for focusing primarily on issues of interest to Cherry.<ref name=\"Sutcliffe\" />\n\nHe often used ''Coach's Corner'' to express some of his [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] conservative views and [[Canadian nationalism]], and paid tribute to Canadian law enforcement and the military.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> He has also endorsed conservative political candidates, and has made many references to \"left-wing pinkos\".<ref name=\"Vlessing2010\" /> In 2003, the hosts devoted an entire show to discussing the federal government's decision to refrain from participating in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and the [[Iraq War]] led by the United States.<ref name=\"CBC2004\" /> The annual broadcast preceding or on [[Remembrance Day#Canada|Remembrance Day]] included a video clip of Cherry walking in a \"[[war cemetery]] in France that's full of Canadian soldiers\".<ref name=\"Larson\" />\n\nPat Hickey, writing for the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' in 2014, stated that ''Coach's Corner'' is not the appropriate forum to honour the military or to discuss politics.<ref name=\"Hickey\" /> In a February 2018 broadcast, Cherry stated that people who believe [[climate change]] are \"cuckaloos\", eliciting a response from [[Catherine McKenna]], the federal [[Minister of Environment and Climate Change (Canada)|Minister of Environment and Climate Change]].<ref name=\"Kalvapalle\" /> In a broadcast in 2008, he had referred to environmentalist [[David Suzuki]] as a \"left-wing kook\".<ref name=\"Kalvapalle\" />\n\nSome of his proclamations on the show have been criticized for insulting [[Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois people|Quebecois]] and European players, some of whom he has regarded as \"soft\".<ref name=\"Rush\" /> He has stated that Americans are ruining the NHL.<ref name=\"Vlessing2010\" /> \n\nIn a 2011 article in ''[[Maisonneuve (magazine)|Maisonneuve]]'', Mike Spry stated that ''Coach's Corner'' is \"a caricature of sports commentary\", describing it as a comedy and parody that is better suited to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name=\"Spry\" /> He also called for Cherry and MacLean to be fired.<ref name=\"Spry\" />\n\nIn a 2014 article for [[Postmedia News]], Scott Stinson stated that the segment is \"tinged with [[xenophobia]]\".<ref name=\"Stinson\" /> \n\n==== Cherry's removal from ''Hockey Night in Canada'' and end of ''Coach's Corner'' ====\nOn 9 November 2019, Cherry made remarks during ''Coach's Corner'' suggesting that Canadian immigrants benefit from the sacrifices of veterans and do not wear [[remembrance poppies]]. He remarked, \"You people that come here... you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that... These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada, these guys paid the biggest price.\"<ref name=\"NP2019\" /> Sportsnet apologized for the remarks, stating that his comments were discriminatory and offensive, and that they \"do not represent our values and what we stand for as a network.\"<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> His co-host, Ron MacLean also apologized via Twitter, expressing regret for his actions and for allowing Cherry make the comments.<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> The NHL also released a statement on Cherry's comments saying \"the comments made last night were offensive and contrary to the values we believe in.\"<ref name=\"TSN\" /> Cherry later told the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' that he would not apologize for his comments stating \"I have had my say\".<ref name=\"Warmington2019\" />\n\nThe [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC) stated that its internal systems had been overloaded by a high number of complaints.<ref name=\"Strong\" /> Two days later, on 11 November, Remembrance Day, Sportsnet president Bart Yabsley announced that \"following further discussions with Don Cherry after Saturday night's broadcast, it has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down\".<ref name=\"Flanagan\" /> Speaking to the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', Cherry commented \"I know what I said and I meant it. Everybody in Canada should wear a poppy to honour our fallen soldiers... I would have liked to continue doing ''Coach's Corner''. The problem is if I have to watch everything I say, it isn't ''Coach's Corner''\".<ref name=\"Warmington2019-2\" /> He later said that if he had to do it again, he would have said \"everybody\".<ref name=ctvnews1 /><ref name=ctvnews2 />\n\nOn 16 November 2019, Maclean addressed and reflected on the incident during ''Hockey Night in Canada'', the first without Cherry, also announcing the end of ''Coach's Corner''.<ref name=\"Houpt\" /><ref name=\"Shah\" />\n\nFollowing the firing of Cherry, [[Numeris]] figures showed a slumping in the viewership of ''Hockey Night in Canada''. When the NHL season opened in October, the first Saturday night game featuring the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens drew an average audience of 1.247 million. Cherry's last broadcast on 9 November, a game that featured the Maple Leafs playing the Philadelphia Flyers, drew an average audience of 1.027 million; in the two weeks following Cherry's dismissal the eastern broadcast of ''Hockey Night in Canada'' failed to make the Numeris Top 30 ranked TV shows.

Macdonald]], the first [[Prime Minister of Canada]], and [[Wayne Gretzky]], considered one of the greatest hockey players.<ref name=\"Sutcliffe\" />\n\nMacLean has referred to the show as \"six minutes of psychotherapy for athletes\".<ref name=\"Rush\" /> The show has also been described as \"one of the most watched five minutes on Canadian TV\",<ref name=\"Larson\" /> and Cherry as an \"icon of Canadian TV hockey\".<ref name=\"Loriggio\" />\n\nThe last airing of the segment was on November 9, 2019, two days before the firing of Cherry from ''Hockey Night in Canada'' for comments that suggested Canadian immigrants benefit from the sacrifices of veterans but do not wear [[Remembrance poppy|Remembrance Day poppies]].\n\n==Background==\n{{multiple image|\n| image1  = Don Cherry in 2010.jpg\n| width1  = 175\n| image2  = Hockey Night in Canada - Ron MacLean.jpg\n| width2  = 127\n| footer  = [[Don Cherry]] (left) was host of the show from its 1982 inception until 2019, [[Ron MacLean]] (right) since 1986.\n}}\nCherry was hired by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) in 1980 by [[Ralph Mellanby]], executive producer of ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' (HNIC), to be an analyst for the [[1980 Stanley Cup playoffs]].<ref name=\"Rush\" /> He was hired full-time for the following season as a [[colour commentator]], but his habit of cheering for particular teams and his lack of impartiality led to his firing from the role; ''Coach's Corner'' was created as a result, and was hosted by [[Dave Hodge]] and Cherry. Ron MacLean replaced Hodge when was he was hired in 1986.<ref name=\"CBC2015\" /> Cherry earned \"about $1 million\", negotiating contracts that were less than market value for his services in discussions lasting \"about 90 seconds\".<ref name=\"Rush\" /> Editorial control of the program was the responsibility of MacLaren Advertising and Canadian Sports Network in the 1960s and 1970s, and of Ohlmeyer Communications and Molstar in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Shoalts2013\" />\n\nWhen [[Rogers Media]] acquired control of HNIC following the company's 2013 acquisition of [[NHL on Sportsnet#2014-15 contract|Canadian NHL broadcast rights]] (from 2014 to 2026), rumours of Cherry's impending dismissal from the broadcast were predicted, but ''Coach's Corner'' and both Cherry and MacLean were retained,<ref name=\"Rush\" /> albeit with a segment reduced from seven minutes to five.<ref name=\"Shoalts\" /><ref name=\"Hickey\" /> During a November 2013 show in the final year of CBC's broadcast, Cherry stated that Rogers Media should not \"try and ruin a good thing, just leave us alone, and we'll be just as good next year\".<ref name=\"Gordon\" /> In an interview earlier that week, he had stated that \"They've been saying that for 30 years...I know I'm No. 1 and ''Coach's Corner'' is No. 1 and what are you going to do?\"<ref name=\"Loriggio\" />\n\nDuring the first few years of Rogers Media control, Cherry and his bosses frequently argued, and during the [[2014\u201315 NHL season]], he had an on-air outburst complaining about the reduction of broadcast time for ''Coach's Corner''.<ref name=\"Shoalts\" /> Rogers Media also cut all other appearances by Cherry on HNIC broadcasts, restricting him to ''Coach's Corner''.<ref name=\"Shoalts2014\" />\n\nIn a 2017 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Cherry stated that other hockey television hosts \"know all the stats, they know all the players, the whole deal\" but that he \"can pick out things no one else picks out\".<ref name=\"Rush\" /> [[Scott Moore (television executive)|Scott Moore]], president of [[Rogers Sportsnet]], had stated that he had \"never met anybody who has a keener eye for the game\".<ref name=\"Rush\" />\n\n==Broadcast==\nThroughout the week, Cherry and MacLean prepared notes and sent producer Kathy Broderick a list of video clips to prepare for broadcast.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> Broderick would send them both an email on Friday morning, then MacLean would call Cherry at 9:30 Saturday morning to finalize the list of clips for that night's broadcast.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> Every Saturday for 33 years, Cherry answered the call with \"Don's Bicycle Shop, Big Wheel Don talking\", a gag carried over from his coaching days with the [[Boston Bruins]] when [[Bobby Orr]] once answered the phone in Cherry's office with \"Don's Bicycle Shop\".<ref name=\"McGran\" /> They spoke for about half an hour.<ref name=\"McGran\" /> He would not leave his house in the morning.<ref name=\"Menon\" /> Late each Saturday morning, Cherry concluded a telephone conversation with Broderick with the phrase \"I'm going to be brilliant as usual\".<ref name=\"Rush\" /> Cherry would not eat after 13:00, only drinking coffee,<ref name=\"Rush\" /> and would take an afternoon nap.<ref name=\"Menon\" />\n\nAt about 17:00, preparations began during story meetings that cover the entirety of the ''Hockey Night in Canada'' broadcast, including the pre-game show, Hockey Central Saturday, and Headlines.<ref name=\"McGran\" /> MacLean and Cherry arrived on the set at about 17:30, and reviewed highlights from the previous week's games.<ref name=\"McGran\" /> Cherry then sat in his set seat, and the crew adjusted lighting and camera angle for his suit.<ref name=\"McGran\" /> When the game began, MacLean and Cherry sat in a viewing room alone until the first intermission.<ref name=\"McGran\" />\n\n''Coach's Corner'' used a set independent from the rest of the HNIC broadcast, which resulted in Cherry never encountering HNIC's hosts and panellists.<ref name=\"Shoalts\" /> The set was created because Cherry was uncomfortable with the presence of a full crew, and preferred a quiet set and refused an earpiece to receive instructions or notes from the producer.<ref name=\"Shoalts\" /> During the broadcast, only Cherry, MacLean, and the camera operator were on the set.<ref name=\"Shoalts\" /> Cherry has stated this was because he was not a professional broadcaster and was distracted by the presence of other personnel.<ref name=\"Shoalts\" />\n\nOriginally, the show featured a discussion of the first period of the game that was airing, followed by highlights of games from the previous week. With the increasing availability of video highlights from numerous online sports resources, such highlights became increasingly stale by the time they would air on Saturday night, so the show shifted its focus to more obscure and specific elements of the game for Cherry to analyse.<ref name=\"Rush\" />\n\nGeneral and special interest hockey stories were covered on the show. During the final broadcast of the [[2017\u201318 NHL season#Regular season|2017\u201318 NHL regular season]], ''Coach's Corner'' was devoted to the [[Humboldt Broncos bus crash]], which Cherry described as a \"national nightmare\".<ref name=\"Warmington2018\" />\n\nCherry sometimes preceded his commentary with \"I'm going to get in trouble for this\" before making statements that might not be [[politically correct]].<ref name=\"CBC2015\" />\n\nCherry reviewed the segment after it aired, and once again at home, making minor complaints to Broderick about the production.<ref name=\"Rush\" />\n\nThe [[opening sequence]] featured Blue, a [[bull terrier]] Cherry received as a gift from Boston Bruins players.<ref name=\"Northumberland\" /><ref name=\"Foundation\" /><ref name=\"Shephard\" />\n\n===Cherry's suits===\n[[File:Coach's Corner.jpg|thumb|right|alt=In the background is a logo with the word \"Coach's\" above \"Corner\".

One of Cherry's blazers was auctioned for $23,550, and one worn by MacLean was auctioned for $17,941.<ref name=\"Sportsnet\" />\n\n===Advocacy===\nCherry had used the show to promote rule changes. For example, he campaigned for no-touch [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]] in order to reduce injuries caused as a result of players colliding at the end boards when chasing the puck.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> When the rule was implemented, he criticized [[Official (ice hockey)#Referee|referees]] who improperly called the rule.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> He also campaigned for modifications to the protective equipment players wear to make it cause less injuries, rapping a hard plastic elbow pad on the table on air to make his point.\n\nHe criticized [[Coach (ice hockey)|coaches]] for in-game replacement of a goalie performing poorly, instead of doing so during an intermission.<ref name=\"Rush\" />\n\nHe often targeted his messages to children, and proposed changes to children's hockey, such as requiring [[Minor ice hockey|children's hockey leagues]] to use smaller pucks instead of those used by adults.<ref name=\"Campbell\" /> He stated that young children have trouble handling the {{convert|6|oz|g|adj=on}} NHL regulation-sized pucks.<ref name=\"Pack\" /> On the show, he may preface comments to children with \"You kids\" or \"You young kids\"; for example, in a November 2014 show, he stated \"I'm going to show you kids, you young goalies, how to act and how not to act\" in a segment showing clips of NHL goalies.<ref name=\"Matisz\" />\n\nDuring the first intermission of game 2 of the [[2018 Stanley Cup Finals]] between the [[Washington Capitals]] and [[Vegas Golden Knights]], MacLean invited NHL Commissioner [[Gary Bettman]], who was standing nearby, to participate in the segment. Cherry had stated that [[Potential National Hockey League expansion#Quebec City|the league should expand to Quebec City]], and that there has never been another rivalry in any sport like [[Battle of Quebec (ice hockey)|that between the Montreal Canadiens and the Quebec Nordiques]].<ref name=\"CBC2018\" /> Bettman stated that Cherry's \"popularity just went up in Quebec\".<ref name=\"CBC2018\" />\n\n==Criticism==\nCherry's strong opinions at times led to repercussions, including several attempts by the CBC to fire him.<ref name=\"Rush\" /><ref name=\"Shoalts2014\" /> In the early 1980s, as a result of his inability to pronounce names and for \"butchering the language\", CBC executives were prepared to fire him, but refrained when Mellanby told them he would quit if Cherry was fired.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> Columnists have referred to him as a [[wikt:troglodyte|troglodyte]] and a [[Misogyny|misogynist]] for the views he expresses on the show.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> In 2004, the CBC tested running ''Coach's Corner'' on a seven-second delay<ref name=\"Menon\" /> after he made \"inappropriate and reprehensible personal\" statements on 24 January 2004 broadcast.<ref name=\"CBC2004\" /> He has stated that [[National Hockey League rules|National Hockey League rule]] changes to limit fighting in the game, particularly the [[Penalty (ice hockey)#Instigator penalty|instigator rule]], were made because \"nerds don't want fighting\" and that the lack of protection by [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcers]] of star players is why there is an increasing prevalence of injuries to the latter,<ref name=\"Simmons\" /> and wanted enforcers in the game so that star players such as [[Connor McDavid]] would not have to fight.<ref name=\"Matisz\" /> The segment was also criticized for being a dominant presence on ''Hockey Night in Canada'', and for focusing primarily on issues of interest to Cherry.<ref name=\"Sutcliffe\" />\n\nHe often used ''Coach's Corner'' to express some of his [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] conservative views and [[Canadian nationalism]], and paid tribute to Canadian law enforcement and the military.<ref name=\"Rush\" /> He has also endorsed conservative political candidates, and has made many references to \"left-wing pinkos\".<ref name=\"Vlessing2010\" /> In 2003, the hosts devoted an entire show to discussing the federal government's decision to refrain from participating in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and the [[Iraq War]] led by the United States.<ref name=\"CBC2004\" /> The annual broadcast preceding or on [[Remembrance Day#Canada|Remembrance Day]] included a video clip of Cherry walking in a \"[[war cemetery]] in France that's full of Canadian soldiers\".<ref name=\"Larson\" />\n\nPat Hickey, writing for the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' in 2014, stated that ''Coach's Corner'' is not the appropriate forum to honour the military or to discuss politics.<ref name=\"Hickey\" /> In a February 2018 broadcast, Cherry stated that people who believe [[climate change]] are \"cuckaloos\", eliciting a response from [[Catherine McKenna]], the federal [[Minister of Environment and Climate Change (Canada)|Minister of Environment and Climate Change]].<ref name=\"Kalvapalle\" /> In a broadcast in 2008, he had referred to environmentalist [[David Suzuki]] as a \"left-wing kook\".<ref name=\"Kalvapalle\" />\n\nSome of his proclamations on the show have been criticized for insulting [[Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois people|Quebecois]] and European players, some of whom he has regarded as \"soft\".<ref name=\"Rush\" /> He has stated that Americans are ruining the NHL.<ref name=\"Vlessing2010\" /> \n\nIn a 2011 article in ''[[Maisonneuve (magazine)|Maisonneuve]]'', Mike Spry stated that ''Coach's Corner'' is \"a caricature of sports commentary\", describing it as a comedy and parody that is better suited to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name=\"Spry\" /> He also called for Cherry and MacLean to be fired.<ref name=\"Spry\" />\n\nIn a 2014 article for [[Postmedia News]], Scott Stinson stated that the segment is \"tinged with [[xenophobia]]\".<ref name=\"Stinson\" /> \n\n==== Cherry's removal from ''Hockey Night in Canada'' and end of ''Coach's Corner'' ====\nOn 9 November 2019, Cherry made remarks during ''Coach's Corner'' suggesting that Canadian immigrants benefit from the sacrifices of veterans and do not wear [[remembrance poppies]]. He remarked, \"You people that come here... you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that... These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada, these guys paid the biggest price.\"<ref name=\"NP2019\" /> Sportsnet apologized for the remarks, stating that his comments were discriminatory and offensive, and that they \"do not represent our values and what we stand for as a network.\"<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> His co-host, Ron MacLean also apologized via Twitter, expressing regret for his actions and for allowing Cherry make the comments.<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> The NHL also released a statement on Cherry's comments saying \"the comments made last night were offensive and contrary to the values we believe in.\"<ref name=\"TSN\" /> Cherry later told the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' that he would not apologize for his comments stating \"I have had my say\".<ref name=\"Warmington2019\" />\n\nThe [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC) stated that its internal systems had been overloaded by a high number of complaints.<ref name=\"Strong\" /> Two days later, on 11 November, Remembrance Day, Sportsnet president Bart Yabsley announced that \"following further discussions with Don Cherry after Saturday night's broadcast, it has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down\".<ref name=\"Flanagan\" /> Speaking to the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', Cherry commented \"I know what I said and I meant it. Everybody in Canada should wear a poppy to honour our fallen soldiers... I would have liked to continue doing ''Coach's Corner''. The problem is if I have to watch everything I say, it isn't ''Coach's Corner''\".<ref name=\"Warmington2019-2\" /> He later said that if he had to do it again, he would have said \"everybody\".<ref name=ctvnews1 /><ref name=ctvnews2 />\n\nOn 16 November 2019, Maclean addressed and reflected on the incident during ''Hockey Night in Canada'', the first without Cherry, also announcing the end of ''Coach's Corner''.<ref name=\"Houpt\" /><ref name=\"Shah\" />\n\nFollowing the firing of Cherry, [[Numeris]] figures showed a slumping in the viewership of ''Hockey Night in Canada''. When the NHL season opened in October, the first Saturday night game featuring the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens drew an average audience of 1.247 million. Cherry's last broadcast on 9 November, a game that featured the Maple Leafs playing the Philadelphia Flyers, drew an average audience of 1.027 million; in the two weeks following Cherry's dismissal the eastern broadcast of ''Hockey Night in Canada'' failed to make the Numeris Top 30 ranked TV shows. On 13 December, the main game drew an average audience of 810,000 compared to 983,000 for the same weekend in 2018.<ref name=numeris />\n\n==Awards==\n''Coach's Corner'' was nominated for a Best

''[[Supporting Caste]]'' by the Canadian punk rock band [[Propagandhi]] includes the song \"Dear Coach's Corner\", in which the singer directs questions to MacLean, asking why his niece should be
