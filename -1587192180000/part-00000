The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) ([http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf Turner, 2008]). In 2008, the NIST published the U.S. version ([http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/sp330.pdf Taylor and Thompson, 2008a]) of the English text of the eighth edition of the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] (BIPM) publication {{lang|fr|Le Syst\u00e8me International d' Unit\u00e9s (SI)}} ([http://www1.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8.pdf BIPM, 2006]).

The Director of the NIST officially recognized this publication, together with [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf Taylor and Thompson (2008b)], as the \"legal interpretation\" of the SI for the United States ([http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/FRN_Vol_73_No_96_16May2008_SI_Interpretation.pdf Turner, 2008]).}}\n\nOne litre of liquid water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]], because the kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice ({{val|0|u=degC}}). Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact.<ref name=decree />\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Masskrug.jpg|thumb|upright|One-litre beer mugs (Ma\u00dfkr\u00fcge) at the 2006 [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany]]\n\nA litre is a cubic [[decimetre]] or 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres, (1&nbsp;L \u2261 1&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup> \u2261 1000&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>). Hence 1&nbsp;L \u2261 0.001&nbsp;[[Cubic metre|m<sup>3</sup>]] \u2261 1000&nbsp;[[cubic centimetre|cm<sup>3</sup>]], and 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> (i.e. a cubic metre, which is the [[SI]] unit for volume) is exactly 1000&nbsp;L.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1964, the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density (+4&nbsp;\u00b0C) and standard pressure. The kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]] (a specific platinum/iridium cylinder) and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1&nbsp;litre of water referred to above. It was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus, during this time, a litre was about 1.000028&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup>. Additionally, the mass\u2013volume relationship of water (as with any fluid) depends on temperature, pressure, purity and isotopic uniformity. In 1964, the definition relating the litre to mass was superseded by the current one. Although the litre is not an SI unit, it is accepted by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] (the standards body that defines the SI) for use with the SI. CGPM defines the litre and its acceptable symbols.\n\nA litre is equal in volume to the [[stere|millistere]], an obsolete non-SI [[Metric system|metric]] unit customarily used for [[dry measure]].\n\n==Explanation==\nLitres are most commonly used for items (such as [[fluid]]s and solids that can be poured), which are measured by the capacity or size of their container, whereas cubic metres (and derived units) are most commonly used for items measured either by their dimensions or their displacements. The litre is often also used in some calculated measurements, such as density (kg/L), allowing an easy comparison with the density of water.\n\nOne litre of water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]] when measured at its maximal density, which occurs at about 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. It follows, therefore, that 1,000th of a litre, known as one millilitre (1 mL) of water has a mass of about 1&nbsp;g; 1,000 litres of water has a mass of about 1,000&nbsp;kg (1&nbsp;[[tonne]]). This relationship holds because the gram was originally defined as the mass of 1&nbsp;mL of water; however, this definition was abandoned in 1799 because the density of water changes with temperature and, very slightly, with pressure.\n\nIt is now known that the density of water also depends on the isotopic ratios of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a particular sample. Modern measurements of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]], which is pure distilled water with an [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition representative of the average of the world's oceans, show it has a density of {{nowrap|{{val|fmt=commas|0.999975}} \u00b1{{val|fmt=commas|0.000001}}&nbsp;kg/L}} at its point of maximum density (3.984&nbsp;\u00b0C) under one standard atmosphere (760&nbsp;[[Torr]], 101.325&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]) of pressure.<ref>Isotopic composition and temperature per London South Bank University\u2019s [http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/data.html \"List of physicochemical data concerning water\"], density and uncertainty per [http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/ NIST Standard Reference Database Number 69] (Retrieved: 2010-04-05)</ref>\n\n== SI prefixes applied to the litre==\n\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Glucose]] and from some prefixed units-->\nThe litre, though not an official SI unit, may be used with [[SI prefix]]es. The most commonly used derived unit is the millilitre, defined as one-thousandth of a litre, and also often referred to by the SI derived unit name \"cubic centimetre\". It is a commonly used measure, especially in medicine, cooking and automotive engineering. Other units may be found in the table below, where the more often used terms are in bold. However, some authorities advise against some of them; for example, in the United States, [[NIST]] advocates using the millilitre or litre instead of the centilitre.<ref>Kenneth Butcher, Linda Crown, Elizabeth J.

One cubic foot would contain exactly 27 such cubes (four inches on each side), making one cubic foot approximately equal to 27 litres. One cubic foot has an exact volume of 28.316846592 litres, which is 4.88% higher than the 27 litre approximation.\n\nA litre of liquid water has a mass almost exactly equal to one [[kilogram]]. An early definition of the kilogram was set as the mass of one litre of water. Because volume changes with temperature and pressure, and pressure uses units of mass, the definition of a kilogram was changed.

In many English-speaking countries, however, the most common shape of a handwritten [[Arabic digit]] 1 is just a [[Regional handwriting variation|vertical stroke]]; that is, it lacks the upstroke added in many other cultures. Therefore, the digit \"1\" may easily be confused with the letter \"l\". In some computer typefaces, the two characters are barely distinguishable. This caused some concern, especially in the medical community.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs a result, '''L''' (uppercase letter L) was adopted as an alternative symbol for litre in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The [[United States]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] now recommends the use of the uppercase letter L,<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html#table6 Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI by the CIPM] \u2013 [[NIST]]</ref> a practice that is also widely followed in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]. In these countries, the symbol L is also used with prefixes, as in mL and \u03bcL, instead of the traditional ml and \u03bcl used in Europe. In [[United Kingdom|the UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] as well as the rest of Europe, lowercase ''l'' is used with prefixes, though whole litres are often written in full (so, \"750&nbsp;ml\" on a wine bottle, but often \"1 litre\" on a juice carton).

Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact.<ref name=decree />\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Masskrug.jpg|thumb|upright|One-litre beer mugs (Ma\u00dfkr\u00fcge) at the 2006 [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany]]\n\nA litre is a cubic [[decimetre]] or 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres \u00d7 10 centimetres, (1&nbsp;L \u2261 1&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup> \u2261 1000&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>). Hence 1&nbsp;L \u2261 0.001&nbsp;[[Cubic metre|m<sup>3</sup>]] \u2261 1000&nbsp;[[cubic centimetre|cm<sup>3</sup>]], and 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> (i.e. a cubic metre, which is the [[SI]] unit for volume) is exactly 1000&nbsp;L.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1964, the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density (+4&nbsp;\u00b0C) and standard pressure. The kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]] (a specific platinum/iridium cylinder) and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1&nbsp;litre of water referred to above. It was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus, during this time, a litre was about 1.000028&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup>. Additionally, the mass\u2013volume relationship of water (as with any fluid) depends on temperature, pressure, purity and isotopic uniformity. In 1964, the definition relating the litre to mass was superseded by the current one. Although the litre is not an SI unit, it is accepted by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] (the standards body that defines the SI) for use with the SI. CGPM defines the litre and its acceptable symbols.\n\nA litre is equal in volume to the [[stere|millistere]], an obsolete non-SI [[Metric system|metric]] unit customarily used for [[dry measure]].\n\n==Explanation==\nLitres are most commonly used for items (such as [[fluid]]s and solids that can be poured), which are measured by the capacity or size of their container, whereas cubic metres (and derived units) are most commonly used for items measured either by their dimensions or their displacements. The litre is often also used in some calculated measurements, such as density (kg/L), allowing an easy comparison with the density of water.\n\nOne litre of water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]] when measured at its maximal density, which occurs at about 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. It follows, therefore, that 1,000th of a litre, known as one millilitre (1 mL) of water has a mass of about 1&nbsp;g; 1,000 litres of water has a mass of about 1,000&nbsp;kg (1&nbsp;[[tonne]]). This relationship holds because the gram was originally defined as the mass of 1&nbsp;mL of water; however, this definition was abandoned in 1799 because the density of water changes with temperature and, very slightly, with pressure.\n\nIt is now known that the density of water also depends on the isotopic ratios of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a particular sample. Modern measurements of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]], which is pure distilled water with an [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition representative of the average of the world's oceans, show it has a density of {{nowrap|{{val|fmt=commas|0.999975}} \u00b1{{val|fmt=commas|0.000001}}&nbsp;kg/L}} at its point of maximum density (3.984&nbsp;\u00b0C) under one standard atmosphere (760&nbsp;[[Torr]], 101.325&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]) of pressure.<ref>Isotopic composition and temperature per London South Bank University\u2019s [http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/data.html \"List of physicochemical data concerning water\"], density and uncertainty per [http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/ NIST Standard Reference Database Number 69] (Retrieved: 2010-04-05)</ref>\n\n== SI prefixes applied to the litre==\n\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Glucose]] and from some prefixed units-->\nThe litre, though not an official SI unit, may be used with [[SI prefix]]es. The most commonly used derived unit is the millilitre, defined as one-thousandth of a litre, and also often referred to by the SI derived unit name \"cubic centimetre\". It is a commonly used measure, especially in medicine, cooking and automotive engineering. Other units may be found in the table below, where the more often used terms are in bold. However, some authorities advise against some of them; for example, in the United States, [[NIST]] advocates using the millilitre or litre instead of the centilitre.<ref>Kenneth Butcher, Linda Crown, Elizabeth J.

A [[mnemonic]] for its volume relative to an imperial pint is \u2018a litre of water's a pint and three quarters\u2019; this is very close, as a litre is actually 1.75975399 pints.\n\nA litre is the volume of a cube with sides of 10&nbsp;cm, which is slightly less than a cube of sides 4&nbsp;inches (one-third of a foot). One cubic foot would contain exactly 27 such cubes (four inches on each side), making one cubic foot approximately equal to 27 litres. One cubic foot has an exact volume of 28.316846592 litres, which is 4.88% higher than the 27 litre approximation.\n\nA litre of liquid water has a mass almost exactly equal to one [[kilogram]]. An early definition of the kilogram was set as the mass of one litre of water. Because volume changes with temperature and pressure, and pressure uses units of mass, the definition of a kilogram was changed. At [[standard pressure]], one litre of water has a mass of 0.999975&nbsp;kg at {{nowrap|4&nbsp;\u00b0C}}, and 0.997&nbsp;kg at {{nowrap|25&nbsp;\u00b0C}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/javascript/water-density.html |title=Online water density calculator |publisher=Antoine.frostburg.edu |accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Symbol==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[International System of Units]] -->\nOriginally, the only symbol for the litre was '''l''' (lowercase letter L), following the [[SI]] convention that only those unit symbols that abbreviate the name of a person start with a capital letter. In many English-speaking countries, however, the most common shape of a handwritten [[Arabic digit]] 1 is just a [[Regional handwriting variation|vertical stroke]]; that is, it lacks the upstroke added in many other cultures. Therefore, the digit \"1\" may easily be confused with the letter \"l\". In some computer typefaces, the two characters are barely distinguishable. This caused some concern, especially in the medical community.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs a result, '''L''' (uppercase letter L) was adopted as an alternative symbol for litre in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The [[United States]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] now recommends the use of the uppercase letter L,<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html#table6 Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI by the CIPM] \u2013 [[NIST]]</ref> a practice that is also widely followed in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]. In these countries, the symbol L is also used with prefixes, as in mL and \u03bcL, instead of the traditional ml and \u03bcl used in Europe. In [[United Kingdom|the UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] as well as the rest of Europe, lowercase ''l'' is used with prefixes, though whole litres are often written in full (so, \"750&nbsp;ml\" on a wine bottle, but often \"1 litre\" on a juice carton). In 1990, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] stated that it was too early to choose a single symbol for the litre.<ref name=\"BIPM2006-brochure\" />\n\n=== Unicode ===\nPrior to 1979, the symbol <span style=\"font-size:112%\">{{Litre}}</span> came into common use in some countries;{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} for example, it was recommended by [[South African Bureau of Standards]] publication M33 and Canada in the 1970s. This symbol can still be encountered occasionally in some English-speaking and European countries like Germany, and its use is ubiquitous in Japan and South Korea.\n\nFonts covering the [[CJK characters]] usually include not only the script small {{Litre}} but also four precomposed characters: <span style=\"font-size:112%\">\u3395, \u3396, \u3397</span> and <span style=\"font-size:112%\">\u3398</span> for the microlitre, millilitre, decilitre and kilolitre.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\" |Litre: Unicode characters.<ref name=\"Unicode-U3300\">{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U3300.pdf |access-date=May 24, 2019 |title=The Unicode Standard 12.0 \u2013 CJK Compatibility \u2770 Range: 3300\u201433FF \u2771 |author=Unicode Consortium |author-link=Unicode Consortium |date=2019 |website=Unicode.org}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Symbol\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Name\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Unicode number\n|-\n| \u2113 \n| Litre (Script Small L)\n| U+2113\n|-\n| \u3395\n| Microlitre (Square MU L)\n| U+3395\n|-\n| \u3396 \n| Millilitre (Square ML)\n| U+3396\n|-\n| \u3397\n| Decilitre (Square DL)\n| U+3397\n|-\n| \u3398\n| Kilolitre (Square KL)\n| U+3398\n|}\n\n==History==\nThe first name of the litre was \"cadil\"; standards are shown at the [[Mus\u00e9e des arts et m\u00e9tiers|Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers]] in Paris.<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://2007.artsetmetiers.net/pdf/DEFPC_VG_COLLEGE.pdf\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131109202133/http://2007.artsetmetiers.net/pdf/DEFPC_VG_COLLEGE.pdf\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 9 November 2013\n |title      = Visite G\u00e9n\u00e9rale au Mus\u00e9e des arts et m\u00e9tiers\n |publisher  = [[Mus\u00e9e des arts et m\u00e9tiers]]\n |location   = Paris\n |quote      = Comment s\u2019est appel\u00e9 cet \u00e9talon de mesure avant de s\u2019appeler le litre ? - Le Cadil [What was the name of this measurement before called being called a litre? - a Cadil].\n |accessdate = 5 August 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nThe litre was introduced in [[France]] in 1795 as one of the new [[Metric system#Original system|\"republican units of measurement\"]] and defined as one [[Cubic metre#Submultiples|cubic decimetre]].<ref name=1795def>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.metrodiff.org/cmsms/index.php?page=18_germinal_an_3\n|title = D\u00e9cret relatif aux poids et aux mesures du 18 germinal an 3 (7 avril 1795)\n|language = French\n|trans-title = Weights and measures decree dated 18 Germinal, Year 3 (7 April 1795)\n|publisher = Association M\u00e9trodiff\n|date = 7 April 1795\n|quote = ''Litre, la mesure de capacit\u00e9, tant pour les liquides que pour les mati\u00e8res s\u00e8ches, dont la contenance sera celle du cube de la dixi\u00e8rne partie du m\u00e8tre.''\n|access-date = 8 December 2012\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160817122340/http://www.metrodiff.org/cmsms/index.php?page=18_germinal_an_3\n|archive-date = 17 August 2016\n|url-status = dead\n}} English translation: \u2018''Litre'': unit of capacity for both liquids and solids which will be equivalent to a cube of [with sides] one tenth of a metre.\u2019</ref>\nOne litre of liquid water has a [[mass]] of almost exactly one [[kilogram]], due to the gram being defined in 1795 as one cubic centimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice.<ref name=decree>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.metrodiff.org/cmsms/index.php?page=18_germinal_an_3\n|title = D\u00e9cret relatif aux poids et aux mesures du 18 germinal an 3 (7 avril 1795)\n|language = French\n|trans-title = Weights and measures decree dated 18 Germinal, Year 3 (7 April 1795)\n|publisher = Association M\u00e9trodiff\n|date = 7 April 1795\n|quote = ''Gramme'', le poids absolu d'un volume d'eau pure \u00e9gal au cube de la centi\u00e8me partie du m\u00e8tre , et \u00e0 la temp\u00e9rature de la glace fondante.\n|access-date = 8 December 2012\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160817122340/http://www.metrodiff.org/cmsms/index.php?page=18_germinal_an_3\n|archive-date = 17 August 2016\n|url-status = dead\n}} English translation: \u2018''Gramme'': the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to the cube of the hundredth part of the meter, at the temperature of melting ice.\u2019</ref>\nThe original decimetre length was 44.344 ''lignes'', which was revised in 1798 to 44.3296 ''lignes''. This made the original litre {{val|1.000974}} of today's cubic decimetre. It was against this litre that the kilogram was constructed.\n\nIn 1879, the [[Comit\u00e9 International des Poids et Mesures|CIPM]] adopted the definition of the litre, with the symbol '''l''' (lowercase letter L).\n\nIn 1901, at the 3rd [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] conference, the litre was redefined as the space occupied by 1&nbsp;kg of pure [[water]] at the temperature of its maximum density (3.98&nbsp;\u00b0C) under a pressure of 1&nbsp;[[Standard atmospheric pressure|atm]]. This made the litre equal to about {{val|1.000028|u=dm3}} (earlier reference works usually put it at {{val|1.000027|u=dm3}}).\n\nIn 1964, at the 12th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] conference, the original definition was reverted to, and thus the litre was once again defined in exact relation to the metre, as another name for the cubic decimetre, that is, exactly 1&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/appxc.cfm#4e |title=NIST, 2000 |publisher=Ts.nist.gov |accessdate=2012-04-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210164956/http://ts.nist.gov/weightsandmeasures/publications/appxc.cfm |archivedate=10 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, at the 16th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] conference, the alternative symbol '''L''' (uppercase letter L) was adopted.

The abbreviation \"cc\" is still commonly used in many fields including medical dosage and sizing for [[internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] [[engine displacement|displacement]].\n\nThe microlitre (\u03bcL) has been known in the past as the [[Lambda (unit)|lambda]] (\u03bb), but this usage is now discouraged.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Carl A. |last1=Burtis |first2=David E. |last2=Bruns |year=2014 |title=Tietz Fundamentals of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics |edition=7. |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780323292061 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p7XwAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA114 |pages=114}}</ref> In the medical field the microlitre is sometimes abbreviated as '''mcL''' on test results.<ref>{{cite web|title=Units of Measurement - Mayo Medical Laboratories|url=http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/appendix/measurement.html|website=www.mayomedicallaboratories.com|accessdate=23 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[SI]] system, use of prefixes for powers of 1,000 is preferred and all other multiples discouraged.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}<!-- is this true?? --> In countries where \nthe [[metric system]] was established well before the adoption of the [[SI]] standard other multiples were already established, their use remains common. In particular, use of the \"centi\" (10<sup>\u22122</sup>), \"deci\" (10<sup>\u22121</sup>), \"deca\" (10<sup>+1</sup>) and \"hecto\" (10<sup>+2</sup>) prefixes are still common.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} For example, in many European countries, the hectolitre is the typical unit for production and export volumes of [[beverages]] (milk, beer, soft drinks, wine, etc.) and for measuring the size of the catch and quotas for fishing boats; decilitres are common in [[Switzerland]] and [[Scandinavia]] and sometimes found in cookbooks; centilitres indicate the capacity of drinking glasses and of small bottles. In colloquial [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in [[Belgium]], a \"vijfentwintiger\" and a \"drie\u00ebndertiger\" (literally \"twenty-fiver\" and \"thirty-threer\") are the common beer glasses, the corresponding bottles mention 25&thinsp;cL or 33&thinsp;cL. Bottles may also be 75&thinsp;cL or half size at 37.5&thinsp;cL for 'artisanal' brews or 70&thinsp;cL for wines or spirits. Cans come in 25&thinsp;cL, 33&thinsp;cL and 50&thinsp;cL.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn countries where the metric system was adopted as the official measuring system after the [[SI]] standard was established, common usage more closely follows contemporary [[SI]] conventions. For example, in [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], consumer beverages are labelled almost exclusively using litres and millilitres. Hectolitres sometimes appear in industry, but centilitres and decilitres are rarely, if ever, used.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} An exception is in pathology, where for instance [[blood lead level]] may be measured in micrograms per decilitre.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Larger volumes are usually given in cubic metres (equivalent to 1&nbsp;kL), or thousands or millions of cubic metres.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAlthough kilolitres, megalitres, and gigalitres are commonly used for measuring water consumption, reservoir capacities and river flows, for larger volumes of fluids, such as annual consumption of tap water, lorry (truck) tanks, or swimming pools, the [[cubic metre]] is the general unit.
