John von Neumann, \u201cVarious techniques used in connection with random digits,\u201d in A.S. Householder, G.E. Forsythe, and H.H. Germond, eds., ''Monte Carlo Method, National Bureau of Standards Applied Mathematics Series'', vol. 12 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1951): pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nIn the 1949 talk, Von Neumann quipped that, \"Any one who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.\" What he meant, he elaborated, was that there were no true \"random numbers\", just means to produce them, and \"a strict arithmetic procedure\", like the middle-square method, \"is not such a method.\" Nevertheless he found these methods hundreds of times faster than reading \"truly\" random numbers off [[punch cards]], which had practical importance for his [[ENIAC]] work. He found the \"destruction\" of middle-square sequences to be a factor in their favor, because it could be easily detected: \"one always fears the appearance of undetected short cycles.\"<ref name=\"vonneumann\"/> [[Nicholas Metropolis]] reported sequences of 750,000 digits before \"destruction\" by means of using 38-bit numbers with the \"middle-square\" method.<ref>Donald E. Knuth, ''The art of computer programming, Vol. 2, Seminumerical algorithms,'' 2nd edn. (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1981), ch. 3, section 3.1.</ref>\n\n===First invention theory===\nThe book ''The Broken Dice'' by [[Ivar Ekeland]] gives an extended account of how the  \nmethod was invented by a Franciscan friar known only as Brother Edvin sometime between 1240 and 1250.<ref name=\"Ekeland1996\">{{cite book|author=Ivar Ekeland|title=The Broken Dice, and Other Mathematical Tales of Chance|date=15 June 1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-19992-4}}</ref> Supposedly, the manuscript is now lost, but [[Jorge Luis Borges]] sent Ekeland  a copy that he made at the Vatican Library.\n\n== The method == \nTo generate a sequence of n-digit pseudorandom numbers, an n-digit starting value is created and squared, producing a 2n-digit number.  If the result has fewer than 2n digits, [[leading zero]]es are added to compensate. The middle n digits of the result would be the next number in the sequence, and returned as the result. This process is then repeated to generate more numbers. \n\nThe value of n must be even in order for the method to work-- if the value of n is odd then there will not necessarily be a uniquely defined 'middle n-digits' to select from. Consider the following: If a 3-digit number is squared it can yield a 6 digit number (eg: 540<sup>''2''</sup> = 291600). If there were to be a middle three digit that would leave 6 \u2212 3 = 3 digits to be distributed to the left and right of the middle. It is impossible to evenly distribute these digits equally on both sides of the middle number and therefore there are no 'middle digits.' It is acceptable to pad the seeds with zeros to the left in order to create an even valued n-digit (eg: 540 \u2192 0540).\n\nFor a generator of ''n''-digit numbers, the period can be no longer than 8<sup>''n''</sup>. If the middle ''n'' digits are all zeroes, the generator then outputs zeroes forever. If the first half of a number in the sequence is zeroes, the subsequent numbers will be decreasing to zero. While these runs of zero are easy to detect, they occur too frequently for this method to be of practical use. The middle-squared method can also get stuck on a number other than zero.  For ''n'' = 4, this occurs with the values 0100, 2500, 3792, and 7600.  Other seed values form very short repeating cycles, e.g., 0540 \u2192 2916 \u2192 5030 \u2192 3009. These phenomena are even more obvious when ''n'' = 2, as none of the 100 possible seeds generates more than 14 iterations without reverting to 0, 10, 50, 60, or a 24 \u2194 57 loop.\n\n=== Example implementation ===\nHere, the algorithm is rendered in [[Python 3]]. \n<source lang=\"python\">\nseed_number = int(input(\"Please enter a four digit number:\\n[####] \"))\nnumber = seed_number\nalready_seen = set()\ncounter = 0\n\nwhile number not in already_seen:\n    counter += 1\n    already_seen.add(number)\n    number = int(str(number * number).zfill(8)[2:6])  # zfill adds padding of zeroes\n    print(f\"#{counter}: {number}\")\n\nprint(f\"We began with {seed_number}, and\"\n      f\" have repeated ourselves after {counter} steps\"\n      f\" with {number}.\")\n</source>\n\n== Middle Square Weyl Sequence PRNG ==\nThe defects associated with the original middle-square generator can be rectified by running the middle square with a [[Weyl sequence]]<ref name=\"mswsrngpaper\">{{cite arXiv\n| last=Widynski | first=Bernard\n| eprint=1704.00358v4 \n| title=Middle Square Weyl Sequence RNG\n| date=April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"mswsrng\">[http://mswsrng.wixsite.com/rand Middle Square Weyl Sequence RNG website].</ref>.

Germond, eds., ''Monte Carlo Method, National Bureau of Standards Applied Mathematics Series'', vol. 12 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1951): pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nIn the 1949 talk, Von Neumann quipped that, \"Any one who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.\" What he meant, he elaborated, was that there were no true \"random numbers\", just means to produce them, and \"a strict arithmetic procedure\", like the middle-square method, \"is not such a method.\" Nevertheless he found these methods hundreds of times faster than reading \"truly\" random numbers off [[punch cards]], which had practical importance for his [[ENIAC]] work. He found the \"destruction\" of middle-square sequences to be a factor in their favor, because it could be easily detected: \"one always fears the appearance of undetected short cycles.\"<ref name=\"vonneumann\"/> [[Nicholas Metropolis]] reported sequences of 750,000 digits before \"destruction\" by means of using 38-bit numbers with the \"middle-square\" method.<ref>Donald E. Knuth, ''The art of computer programming, Vol. 2, Seminumerical algorithms,'' 2nd edn. (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1981), ch. 3, section 3.1.</ref>\n\n===First invention theory===\nThe book ''The Broken Dice'' by [[Ivar Ekeland]] gives an extended account of how the  \nmethod was invented by a Franciscan friar known only as Brother Edvin sometime between 1240 and 1250.<ref name=\"Ekeland1996\">{{cite book|author=Ivar Ekeland|title=The Broken Dice, and Other Mathematical Tales of Chance|date=15 June 1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-19992-4}}</ref> Supposedly, the manuscript is now lost, but [[Jorge Luis Borges]] sent Ekeland  a copy that he made at the Vatican Library.\n\n== The method == \nTo generate a sequence of n-digit pseudorandom numbers, an n-digit starting value is created and squared, producing a 2n-digit number.  If the result has fewer than 2n digits, [[leading zero]]es are added to compensate. The middle n digits of the result would be the next number in the sequence, and returned as the result. This process is then repeated to generate more numbers. \n\nThe value of n must be even in order for the method to work-- if the value of n is odd then there will not necessarily be a uniquely defined 'middle n-digits' to select from. Consider the following: If a 3-digit number is squared it can yield a 6 digit number (eg: 540<sup>''2''</sup> = 291600). If there were to be a middle three digit that would leave 6 \u2212 3 = 3 digits to be distributed to the left and right of the middle. It is impossible to evenly distribute these digits equally on both sides of the middle number and therefore there are no 'middle digits.' It is acceptable to pad the seeds with zeros to the left in order to create an even valued n-digit (eg: 540 \u2192 0540).\n\nFor a generator of ''n''-digit numbers, the period can be no longer than 8<sup>''n''</sup>. If the middle ''n'' digits are all zeroes, the generator then outputs zeroes forever. If the first half of a number in the sequence is zeroes, the subsequent numbers will be decreasing to zero. While these runs of zero are easy to detect, they occur too frequently for this method to be of practical use. The middle-squared method can also get stuck on a number other than zero.  For ''n'' = 4, this occurs with the values 0100, 2500, 3792, and 7600.  Other seed values form very short repeating cycles, e.g., 0540 \u2192 2916 \u2192 5030 \u2192 3009. These phenomena are even more obvious when ''n'' = 2, as none of the 100 possible seeds generates more than 14 iterations without reverting to 0, 10, 50, 60, or a 24 \u2194 57 loop.\n\n=== Example implementation ===\nHere, the algorithm is rendered in [[Python 3]]. \n<source lang=\"python\">\nseed_number = int(input(\"Please enter a four digit number:\\n[####] \"))\nnumber = seed_number\nalready_seen = set()\ncounter = 0\n\nwhile number not in already_seen:\n    counter += 1\n    already_seen.add(number)\n    number = int(str(number * number).zfill(8)[2:6])  # zfill adds padding of zeroes\n    print(f\"#{counter}: {number}\")\n\nprint(f\"We began with {seed_number}, and\"\n      f\" have repeated ourselves after {counter} steps\"\n      f\" with {number}.\")\n</source>\n\n== Middle Square Weyl Sequence PRNG ==\nThe defects associated with the original middle-square generator can be rectified by running the middle square with a [[Weyl sequence]]<ref name=\"mswsrngpaper\">{{cite arXiv\n| last=Widynski | first=Bernard\n| eprint=1704.00358v4 \n| title=Middle Square Weyl Sequence RNG\n| date=April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"mswsrng\">[http://mswsrng.wixsite.com/rand Middle Square Weyl Sequence RNG website].</ref>.

In a letter of certain bishops to the [[Emperor Theophilus]], Jesus's height is described as three cubits (four feet six), which was also the opinion of [[Ephrem Syrus]] (320\u2013379 AD), \"God took human form and appeared in the form of three human ells (cubits); he came down to us small of stature.\" [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] likewise claimed that the appearance of Christ was smaller than that of the children of Jacob (Israel). In the [[apocrypha|apocryphal]] [[Publius Lentulus|Lentulus]] letter, Jesus is described as having had a reddish complexion, matching Muslim traditions in this respect. Jesus's prediction that he would be taunted \"Physician, heal yourself\"<ref>Luke 4:23.</ref> may suggest that Jesus was indeed physically deformed ('crooked' or hunch-backed), as claimed in the early Christian texts listed above. [[Justin Martyr]], Tertullian, and [[Ambrose]] considered lack of physical attractiveness in Jesus as fulfilling the messianic prophecy [[Suffering Servant]] narrative of [[Isaiah 53]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Astell|first=Anne W.|title=Eating Beauty: The Eucharist and the Spiritual Arts of the Middle Ages|year=2006|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=81}}</ref>\n\nThe more mainstream, theological perspective, as expressed by [[Church Fathers]] [[Jerome]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]], argued that Jesus must have been ideally beautiful in face and body. For Augustine he was \"beautiful as a child, beautiful on earth, beautiful in heaven\".<ref>''St. Augustin the Writings Against the Manicheans and Against the Donatists'' by St Augustine, Philip Schaff 2005 {{ISBN|0-7661-8394-7}} page 29</ref> These theological arguments were further extended in the 13th century by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' based on his analysis of the [[perfection of Christ]], reasoning that Jesus must have embodied every possible human perfection.<ref>''Summa Theologica, Volume 4 (Part III, First Section)'' by St Thomas Aquinas 2007 {{ISBN|1-60206-560-8}} pp. 2060-2062</ref><ref>''Thomas Aquinas: theologian of the Christian life'' by Nicholas M.

Luttikhuizen 1985 {{ISBN|3-16-144935-5}} page 121</ref> Other spurious references include the [[Archko Volume]] and the letter of [[Pontius Pilate]] to [[Tiberius Caesar]], the descriptions in which were most likely composed in the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"Bible' page 41\"/><ref name=\"New Testament' pages 3-4\"/><ref name=\"Pontius Pilate pages 6-9\"/>\n\nThe [[Letter of Lentulus]], a forged letter supposedly written by [[Publius Lentulus]], the Governor of Judea, to the Roman Senate, according to most scholars was composed to compensate for the lack of any physical description of Jesus in the Bible.<ref name=\"Perkinson30\"/> Also in the 14th century [[Nicephorus Callistus]] quoted an unnamed antique source that described Jesus as tall and beautiful with fair, wavy hair, but his account was most likely without basis and was inspired by the prevailing artistic images of Jesus.<ref>''Jesus'' by Hartmut Miethe, Hilde Heyduck-Huth, {{ISBN|3-930180-21-9}} Taylor & Francis page 168</ref>\n\n===Quranic and Muslim traditions===\nQuranic and hadith traditions such as [[Sahih Bukhari]] as well as [[tafsir]] have given an oral depiction of what Jesus looked like, although some accounts do not match, such as Jesus being both curly haired and straight-haired. The hadith refer to Muhammad's account of the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]], when he is supposed to have been taken up to heaven by the angel Gabriel (Jibra'il), where he saw Jesus and other prophets. Most versions of this say that \"Jesus had curly hair and a reddish complexion\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tatum|first1=W|title=Jesus: A Brief History|date=2009|page=221}}</ref> Others say his face was flushed as if he just had a bath (\"a reddish man with many freckles on his face as if he had just come from a bath\"<ref>Neal Robinson, ''Christ in Islam and Christianity'', SUNY Press, 1990, p.94.</ref><ref>F. E. Peters, ''Reader on Classical Islam'', Princeton University Press, 1993, p.189.</ref>). In another account from Bukhari Jesus is seen in a dream near the Kaaba, as \"a man of a wheatish complexion with straight hair. I asked who it was. They said: This is the Messiah, son of Mary\".<ref>Bukhari, Kitab al-Fitn, ch. 27.</ref> However, other narrations give variations in the color. [[Salim ibn Abd-Allah]] reports from his father [[Abdullah ibn Umar]] that the prophet \"did not say that Jesus was of red complexion\", rather he was \"a man of brown complexion and lank hair\".<ref>Bukhari, ''Kitabul Ahadlth al-Anbiya'', Hadith 3185.</ref> In contrast [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas]] says that Jesus was of \"moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair.\"<ref>Bukhari, ''Kitabul Bad' al-Khalq'', Hadlth 3000.</ref> According to Hanafi Madhab contradictions in hadith may be resolved through multiple methods, one being the number of times a narration has been made and the number of chain of narrations and the character of those in the chain of narration or the narrator him or herself. There are four hadiths in Bukhari stating Jesus had a brown complexion and three hadiths in Imam Muslim. However, the most prominent narrator is from Salim ibn Abdullah ibn Umar, descendant of Caliph Umar, with a chain of narration that stated:  \"a man of brown complexion and lank hair\".<ref>Bukhari, ''Kitabul Ahadlth al-Anbiya'', Hadith 3185.</ref>\n\nThese variations have been explained in various ways, and have been co-opted to make assertions about race. For example, Ana Echevarr\u00eda notes that medieval Spanish writer [[Jim\u00e9nez de Rada]] in his ''Historia arabum'' chooses a version to emphasise that Jesus is whiter than Muhammad, quoting the Ibn Abbas version: \"I saw Jesus, a man of medium height and moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colours and of lank hair\". Echevarr\u00eda comments that \"Moses and Jesus are portrayed as specimens of a completely different 'ethnic type', fair and blond; 'ethnic' or 'racial' differences between them and Muhammad are thus highlighted.\"<ref>Ana Echevarr\u00eda, \"Eschatology Or Biography? Alfonso X, Muhammad's Ladder And A Jewish Go-Between\", in Cynthia Robinson & Leyla Rouhi (eds), ''Under the Influence: Questioning the Comparative in Medieval Castile'', Brill, Boston, 2005, p.140.</ref> More references needed to prove ethnic/racial difference, none of the hadith state anything about racial difference of Moses has never been made in the Qura'n or hadith. Furthermore, most accounts of hadith state that Moses was of dark complexion, i.e. Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 55, Number 607, Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 55, Number 648, Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 55, Number 650. There is almost universal agreement that Moses was of dark complexion by 6th century Hijazi standards.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Emergence of racial theories==\nAccording to the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]], Jesus was a [[genealogy of Jesus|descendant of King David]].<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew 1:6\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{bibleref2|Luke 3:23\u201338}}</ref> One argument against this{{clarify|The argument against is difficult to comprehend - Solomon and his brother were both sons of David|date=January 2020}} is the contradiction in Jesus's genealogies: Matthew says he is descended from [[Solomon]], and Luke says he is descended from [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], Solomon and Nathan being brothers.

Using the work of Israeli anthropologist Yossi Nagar on the physical characteristics of bones of Jews dating to the time of Jesus, which show similarities to Iraqi Jews of today, Taylor concluded that Jesus had \u2018honey/olive skin\u2019, brown eyes and black hair. As for the \u2018honey/olive\u2019 description, Taylor writes that his skin was \u2018a darker hue consistent with the skin tone of people of the Middle East\u2019 (p.163).

In a letter of certain bishops to the [[Emperor Theophilus]], Jesus's height is described as three cubits (four feet six), which was also the opinion of [[Ephrem Syrus]] (320\u2013379 AD), \"God took human form and appeared in the form of three human ells (cubits); he came down to us small of stature.\" [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] likewise claimed that the appearance of Christ was smaller than that of the children of Jacob (Israel). In the [[apocrypha|apocryphal]] [[Publius Lentulus|Lentulus]] letter, Jesus is described as having had a reddish complexion, matching Muslim traditions in this respect. Jesus's prediction that he would be taunted \"Physician, heal yourself\"<ref>Luke 4:23.</ref> may suggest that Jesus was indeed physically deformed ('crooked' or hunch-backed), as claimed in the early Christian texts listed above. [[Justin Martyr]], Tertullian, and [[Ambrose]] considered lack of physical attractiveness in Jesus as fulfilling the messianic prophecy [[Suffering Servant]] narrative of [[Isaiah 53]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Astell|first=Anne W.|title=Eating Beauty: The Eucharist and the Spiritual Arts of the Middle Ages|year=2006|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=81}}</ref>\n\nThe more mainstream, theological perspective, as expressed by [[Church Fathers]] [[Jerome]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]], argued that Jesus must have been ideally beautiful in face and body. For Augustine he was \"beautiful as a child, beautiful on earth, beautiful in heaven\".<ref>''St. Augustin the Writings Against the Manicheans and Against the Donatists'' by St Augustine, Philip Schaff 2005 {{ISBN|0-7661-8394-7}} page 29</ref> These theological arguments were further extended in the 13th century by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' based on his analysis of the [[perfection of Christ]], reasoning that Jesus must have embodied every possible human perfection.<ref>''Summa Theologica, Volume 4 (Part III, First Section)'' by St Thomas Aquinas 2007 {{ISBN|1-60206-560-8}} pp. 2060-2062</ref><ref>''Thomas Aquinas: theologian of the Christian life'' by Nicholas M.

Luttikhuizen 1985 {{ISBN|3-16-144935-5}} page 121</ref> Other spurious references include the [[Archko Volume]] and the letter of [[Pontius Pilate]] to [[Tiberius Caesar]], the descriptions in which were most likely composed in the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"Bible' page 41\"/><ref name=\"New Testament' pages 3-4\"/><ref name=\"Pontius Pilate pages 6-9\"/>\n\nThe [[Letter of Lentulus]], a forged letter supposedly written by [[Publius Lentulus]], the Governor of Judea, to the Roman Senate, according to most scholars was composed to compensate for the lack of any physical description of Jesus in the Bible.<ref name=\"Perkinson30\"/> Also in the 14th century [[Nicephorus Callistus]] quoted an unnamed antique source that described Jesus as tall and beautiful with fair, wavy hair, but his account was most likely without basis and was inspired by the prevailing artistic images of Jesus.<ref>''Jesus'' by Hartmut Miethe, Hilde Heyduck-Huth, {{ISBN|3-930180-21-9}} Taylor & Francis page 168</ref>\n\n===Quranic and Muslim traditions===\nQuranic and hadith traditions such as [[Sahih Bukhari]] as well as [[tafsir]] have given an oral depiction of what Jesus looked like, although some accounts do not match, such as Jesus being both curly haired and straight-haired. The hadith refer to Muhammad's account of the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]], when he is supposed to have been taken up to heaven by the angel Gabriel (Jibra'il), where he saw Jesus and other prophets. Most versions of this say that \"Jesus had curly hair and a reddish complexion\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tatum|first1=W|title=Jesus: A Brief History|date=2009|page=221}}</ref> Others say his face was flushed as if he just had a bath (\"a reddish man with many freckles on his face as if he had just come from a bath\"<ref>Neal Robinson, ''Christ in Islam and Christianity'', SUNY Press, 1990, p.94.</ref><ref>F. E. Peters, ''Reader on Classical Islam'', Princeton University Press, 1993, p.189.</ref>). In another account from Bukhari Jesus is seen in a dream near the Kaaba, as \"a man of a wheatish complexion with straight hair. I asked who it was. They said: This is the Messiah, son of Mary\".<ref>Bukhari, Kitab al-Fitn, ch. 27.</ref> However, other narrations give variations in the color. [[Salim ibn Abd-Allah]] reports from his father [[Abdullah ibn Umar]] that the prophet \"did not say that Jesus was of red complexion\", rather he was \"a man of brown complexion and lank hair\".<ref>Bukhari, ''Kitabul Ahadlth al-Anbiya'', Hadith 3185.</ref> In contrast [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas]] says that Jesus was of \"moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair.\"<ref>Bukhari, ''Kitabul Bad' al-Khalq'', Hadlth 3000.</ref> According to Hanafi Madhab contradictions in hadith may be resolved through multiple methods, one being the number of times a narration has been made and the number of chain of narrations and the character of those in the chain of narration or the narrator him or herself. There are four hadiths in Bukhari stating Jesus had a brown complexion and three hadiths in Imam Muslim. However, the most prominent narrator is from Salim ibn Abdullah ibn Umar, descendant of Caliph Umar, with a chain of narration that stated:  \"a man of brown complexion and lank hair\".<ref>Bukhari, ''Kitabul Ahadlth al-Anbiya'', Hadith 3185.</ref>\n\nThese variations have been explained in various ways, and have been co-opted to make assertions about race. For example, Ana Echevarr\u00eda notes that medieval Spanish writer [[Jim\u00e9nez de Rada]] in his ''Historia arabum'' chooses a version to emphasise that Jesus is whiter than Muhammad, quoting the Ibn Abbas version: \"I saw Jesus, a man of medium height and moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colours and of lank hair\". Echevarr\u00eda comments that \"Moses and Jesus are portrayed as specimens of a completely different 'ethnic type', fair and blond; 'ethnic' or 'racial' differences between them and Muhammad are thus highlighted.\"<ref>Ana Echevarr\u00eda, \"Eschatology Or Biography? Alfonso X, Muhammad's Ladder And A Jewish Go-Between\", in Cynthia Robinson & Leyla Rouhi (eds), ''Under the Influence: Questioning the Comparative in Medieval Castile'', Brill, Boston, 2005, p.140.</ref> More references needed to prove ethnic/racial difference, none of the hadith state anything about racial difference of Moses has never been made in the Qura'n or hadith. Furthermore, most accounts of hadith state that Moses was of dark complexion, i.e. Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 55, Number 607, Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 55, Number 648, Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 55, Number 650. There is almost universal agreement that Moses was of dark complexion by 6th century Hijazi standards.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Emergence of racial theories==\nAccording to the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]], Jesus was a [[genealogy of Jesus|descendant of King David]].<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew 1:6\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{bibleref2|Luke 3:23\u201338}}</ref> One argument against this{{clarify|The argument against is difficult to comprehend - Solomon and his brother were both sons of David|date=January 2020}} is the contradiction in Jesus's genealogies: Matthew says he is descended from [[Solomon]], and Luke says he is descended from [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], Solomon and Nathan being brothers.

De Bortoli makes a wide range of wines including the sweet white [[Noble One]]. [[File:dbw bilbul 0603.jpg|right|thumb|De Bortoli Wines Bilbul Winery]]\n\n== Wineries and cellar doors ==\nDe Bortoli Wines owns three wineries in three diverse wine growing regions:\n* [[Bilbul, New South Wales|Bilbul]] near [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in the [[Riverina]] region of [[New South Wales]]\n* Near [[cessnock, New South Wales|Cessnock]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of New South Wales\n* [[Dixons Creek, Victoria|Dixons Creek]] near [[Yarra Glen, Victoria|Yarra Glen]] in the [[Yarra Valley]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]\n* [[Rutherglen,_Victoria|Rutherglen]] in the [[Rutherglen_wine_region|Rutherglen wine region]] in Victoria\n\nThe company has vineyards in the same regions as its wineries, along with the [[King Valley]] in Victoria.\n\nThe Yarra Valley Winery also boasts a very popular and highly awarded restaurant featuring Northern Italian inspired cuisine. There is now also a [[cheesemaker]] and cheese shop onsite at the Yarra Winery.\n\n==Winemaking==\nThe winemaking team is overseen by third generation winemaker [[Darren De Bortoli]] and his brother-in-law Steve Webber.  In the early 1980s [[Darren De Bortoli]] created the world acclaimed [[Noble One]] Botrytis Semillon. Steve Webber established the company's premium Yarra Valley winery in the early 1990s and is also responsible for overseeing the company's King Valley vineyards and Hunter Valley winery and vineyards.\n\nThe winemaking philosophy is that good wine begins in the vineyard, that the winemaker should use minimal handling and interference in the winemaking process and that wine should have a sense of regionality and be an expression of the soil in which it is grown.\n\n==Noble One==\nDe Bortoli Wines Noble One [[Botrytis cinerea|Botrytis]] [[Semillon]] is an award winning sweet white wine, developed by Darren De Bortoli during the 1980s. \n\nSince its release Noble One has been awarded 104<ref name=\"deb\">{{cite web|title=Noble One 25th Vintage Anniversary|url=http://www.debortoli.com.au/our-wines/our-brands/noble-one.html}}</ref> Trophies, 352 Gold medals<ref name=\"deb\"/> and 113 International Awards. In 2005 screw cap closures were placed on 50% of the 750ml bottles of 2003 Noble One in a trial that attempted to ensure fruit intensity and freshness for consumers. De Bortoli Wines have kept the 375ml, 50% of the 750ml and all export stock under cork, however in an industry where issues over [[cork taint]] keep arising approximately 34% of wines are sealed with some type of synthetic closure.\n\nNoble One was given its name in 1990 as a result of the bilateral agreement between [[Australia]] and the [[European Economic Community]] in which [[Australia]] agreed to phase out the use of European names on [[wine labels]]. Previously the wine was known as [[Sauternes (wine)|'Sauternes']] but today it is simply called Noble One.\n\n===Background===\nThe fungus [[botrytis cinerea]] is responsible for many of the great sweet whites of Europe including [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]. Botrytis develops on the grape bunches given the right moist and humid conditions. Botrytis spores leach moisture from the berries causing the fruit to break down, concentrating the [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] and magnifying the flavors to produce a very intense, complex wine. High humidity and moderate temperatures during April/May when the grapes are picked, and the high clay content of the soils creates a [[microclimate (wine)|microclimate]] that promotes the development of botrytis in the Riverina.\n\nGrapes for Noble One are grown on De Bortoli's own vineyards and those of a handful of selected growers. The grapes are picked by hand and the juice from each vineyard is fermented separately. The high sugar level presents a challenge during processing as the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] struggles to ferment the juice, making [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] a long drawn out process. The fermentation has to be closely monitored because at these sugar levels acetic acid is produced by the yeast. Acedtic [[acid (wine)|acid]] adds complexity but it can spoil the wine if allowed to become too high. Extreme care also has to be taken to ensure the wine does not oxidise.\n\nOnce fermentation is completed the wines are [[clarified (wine)|clarified]], [[stabilized (wine)|stabilized]], and then aged in new French oak [[barrique]]s for an average of 12 months before blending and bottling.\n\n===History===\nDuring Darren De Bortoli's years at [[Roseworthy College|Roseworthy Agricultural College]], [[Australia|Australia's]] premier winemaking institute, a lot of development work was being done on Botrytis wine styles. While there, De Bortoli decided to make a botrytis affected wine of his own. At that time (1982) there was a surplus of Semillon grapes, a thin skinned, tight bunched varietal particularly susceptible to extensive, uniform botrytis infection. Growers were delighted to be able to sell their \"rotten\" grapes.\n\nThe resulting wine went on to win numerous awards including Best Botrytis Wine at the International Wine and Spirit Competition in 1984. Subsequent vintages were also largely successful. The exception was 1989 when heavy rains totally destroyed the crop.\n\nAs well as making Botrytis Semillon, De Bortoli Wines experimented with other botrytis styles including [[Sp\u00e4tlese]], [[Auslese]] and [[Beerenauslese]] with [[Riesling]] and [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]]. In addition a Botrytis Pedro Ximinez and a Dry Botrytis Semillon were produced.\n\n==History==\nDe Bortoli Wines was established in 1928 by Vittorio & Giuseppina De Bortoli and rapidly expanded under the direction of their son, the [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20031029056 late] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070831185346/http://debortoli.com.au/about-us/our-people/deen-de-bortoli.html Deen De Bortoli].

De Bortoli makes a wide range of wines including the sweet white [[Noble One]]. [[File:dbw bilbul 0603.jpg|right|thumb|De Bortoli Wines Bilbul Winery]]\n\n== Wineries and cellar doors ==\nDe Bortoli Wines owns three wineries in three diverse wine growing regions:\n* [[Bilbul, New South Wales|Bilbul]] near [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in the [[Riverina]] region of [[New South Wales]]\n* Near [[cessnock, New South Wales|Cessnock]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of New South Wales\n* [[Dixons Creek, Victoria|Dixons Creek]] near [[Yarra Glen, Victoria|Yarra Glen]] in the [[Yarra Valley]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]\n* [[Rutherglen,_Victoria|Rutherglen]] in the [[Rutherglen_wine_region|Rutherglen wine region]] in Victoria\n\nThe company has vineyards in the same regions as its wineries, along with the [[King Valley]] in Victoria.\n\nThe Yarra Valley Winery also boasts a very popular and highly awarded restaurant featuring Northern Italian inspired cuisine. There is now also a [[cheesemaker]] and cheese shop onsite at the Yarra Winery.\n\n==Winemaking==\nThe winemaking team is overseen by third generation winemaker [[Darren De Bortoli]] and his brother-in-law Steve Webber.  In the early 1980s [[Darren De Bortoli]] created the world acclaimed [[Noble One]] Botrytis Semillon. Steve Webber established the company's premium Yarra Valley winery in the early 1990s and is also responsible for overseeing the company's King Valley vineyards and Hunter Valley winery and vineyards.\n\nThe winemaking philosophy is that good wine begins in the vineyard, that the winemaker should use minimal handling and interference in the winemaking process and that wine should have a sense of regionality and be an expression of the soil in which it is grown.\n\n==Noble One==\nDe Bortoli Wines Noble One [[Botrytis cinerea|Botrytis]] [[Semillon]] is an award winning sweet white wine, developed by Darren De Bortoli during the 1980s. \n\nSince its release Noble One has been awarded 104<ref name=\"deb\">{{cite web|title=Noble One 25th Vintage Anniversary|url=http://www.debortoli.com.au/our-wines/our-brands/noble-one.html}}</ref> Trophies, 352 Gold medals<ref name=\"deb\"/> and 113 International Awards. In 2005 screw cap closures were placed on 50% of the 750ml bottles of 2003 Noble One in a trial that attempted to ensure fruit intensity and freshness for consumers. De Bortoli Wines have kept the 375ml, 50% of the 750ml and all export stock under cork, however in an industry where issues over [[cork taint]] keep arising approximately 34% of wines are sealed with some type of synthetic closure.\n\nNoble One was given its name in 1990 as a result of the bilateral agreement between [[Australia]] and the [[European Economic Community]] in which [[Australia]] agreed to phase out the use of European names on [[wine labels]]. Previously the wine was known as [[Sauternes (wine)|'Sauternes']] but today it is simply called Noble One.\n\n===Background===\nThe fungus [[botrytis cinerea]] is responsible for many of the great sweet whites of Europe including [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]. Botrytis develops on the grape bunches given the right moist and humid conditions. Botrytis spores leach moisture from the berries causing the fruit to break down, concentrating the [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] and magnifying the flavors to produce a very intense, complex wine. High humidity and moderate temperatures during April/May when the grapes are picked, and the high clay content of the soils creates a [[microclimate (wine)|microclimate]] that promotes the development of botrytis in the Riverina.\n\nGrapes for Noble One are grown on De Bortoli's own vineyards and those of a handful of selected growers. The grapes are picked by hand and the juice from each vineyard is fermented separately. The high sugar level presents a challenge during processing as the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] struggles to ferment the juice, making [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] a long drawn out process. The fermentation has to be closely monitored because at these sugar levels acetic acid is produced by the yeast. Acedtic [[acid (wine)|acid]] adds complexity but it can spoil the wine if allowed to become too high. Extreme care also has to be taken to ensure the wine does not oxidise.\n\nOnce fermentation is completed the wines are [[clarified (wine)|clarified]], [[stabilized (wine)|stabilized]], and then aged in new French oak [[barrique]]s for an average of 12 months before blending and bottling.\n\n===History===\nDuring Darren De Bortoli's years at [[Roseworthy College|Roseworthy Agricultural College]], [[Australia|Australia's]] premier winemaking institute, a lot of development work was being done on Botrytis wine styles. While there, De Bortoli decided to make a botrytis affected wine of his own. At that time (1982) there was a surplus of Semillon grapes, a thin skinned, tight bunched varietal particularly susceptible to extensive, uniform botrytis infection. Growers were delighted to be able to sell their \"rotten\" grapes.\n\nThe resulting wine went on to win numerous awards including Best Botrytis Wine at the International Wine and Spirit Competition in 1984. Subsequent vintages were also largely successful. The exception was 1989 when heavy rains totally destroyed the crop.\n\nAs well as making Botrytis Semillon, De Bortoli Wines experimented with other botrytis styles including [[Sp\u00e4tlese]], [[Auslese]] and [[Beerenauslese]] with [[Riesling]] and [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]]. In addition a Botrytis Pedro Ximinez and a Dry Botrytis Semillon were produced.\n\n==History==\nDe Bortoli Wines was established in 1928 by Vittorio & Giuseppina De Bortoli and rapidly expanded under the direction of their son, the [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20031029056 late] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070831185346/http://debortoli.com.au/about-us/our-people/deen-de-bortoli.html Deen De Bortoli]. Today the company is in the hands of the third generation. The family history is documented in a book called Celebrazione! launched in 2003 to celebrate De Bortoli Wines' 75th Anniversary.\n\n===Darren===\n'''Darren De Bortoli''' (born 1960) is currently the managing director of De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited. He was born in 1960 and then studied winemaking at Roseworthy College in South Australia, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Oenology, in 1982. He is a former winemaker, for this family business, established in 1928 by his grandfather Vittorio De Bortoli. '''Darren''' is well known for his award winning Botrytis Semillon, Noble One. At the age of 33, Darren was appointed Managing Director, which is the position he maintains today. He is also a company director for this family organisation.\n\n'''Darren''' has helped the De Bortoli family achieve its position of Australia\u2019s 6th largest wine company, with an annual turnover of $170 million.  He was also featured in the 2002 episode of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s Dynasties television series titled \"The De Bortolis Of Griffith\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/txt/s1010334.htm}}</ref> which tracked the growth over three generations of the family business from humble Italian immigrants into one of Australia's largest family wine companies.\n\nHe still lives with his family in [[Bilbul, New South Wales]], the village where De Bortoli Wines was established and still home to its head office and to one of its wineries.\n\n===Deen===\n'''Deen De Bortoli''' (born 1936) was the chairman of De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited. He was born in 1936, and at age 15 he left school to help Vittorio and Giuseppina, his parents run the family business.

The virus is primarily spread between people through close contact and via [[respiratory droplets]] produced from coughs or sneezes.<ref name=\"WHO2020QA\" /><ref name=\"CDCTrans\" /> It mainly

name=\"NBCSpread\" /> Indirect contact via [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] is another possible cause of infection.<ref name=\"WHO-Workplace\" /> Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic and steel for up to three days, but does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours;<ref name=\"NEJM-Stability\" /> the virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises its [[lipid bilayer]].<ref name=\"AtlanticSuccess\" /><ref name=\"NatGeoSoap\" /> Viral RNA has also been found in [[Stool test|stool sample]]s from infected individuals.<ref name=\"NEJM-FirstUS\" />\n\nThe degree to which the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain, but research has indicated that the [[pharynx]] reaches peak [[viral load]] approximately four days after infection.<ref name=\"NaturePeakLoad\" /><ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from [[asymptomatic]] cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref name=\"ScienceRapid\" />\n\nThere is some evidence of human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including examples in [[Felidae|felids]].<ref name=\"oie.int\" /><ref

infections from the SARS-CoV-2 strain were discovered in [[Wuhan]], China.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /> The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref

between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> Although studies have suggested some likely candidates, the number and identities of intermediate hosts remain uncertain.<ref name=\"IJID-interm-host\" /> Nearly half of the strain's genome has a phylogenetic lineage distinct from known relatives.<ref name=\"Rejects\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, [[South China Agricultural University]] in [[Guangzhou]] announced that researchers had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% similar\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with

viruses known as [[coronavirus]]es. It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\" /> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a [[polybasic cleavage site]], a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses.
