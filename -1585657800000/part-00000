Alum had been discovered by local citizens of [[Volterra]], who turned to Florence to get backing to exploit this important natural resource. A key commodity in the glass-making, tanning and textile industries, alum was available from only a few sources under the control of the Ottomans and monopolized by [[Genoa]] before the discovery of alum sources in Italy at [[Tolfa]]. First the [[Roman Curia]] in 1462, and then Lorenzo and the Medici Bank less than a year later, got involved in backing the mining operation, with the pope taking a two-ducat commission for each cantar [[quintal]] of alum retrieved and ensuring a monopoly against the Turkish-derived goods by prohibiting trade in alum with infidels.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Decline of the Medici Bank, 1397\u20131494|last=de Roover|first=Raymond|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1963|isbn=|location=|pages=152\u2013154}}</ref> When they realized the value of the alum mine, the people of Volterra wanted its revenues for their municipal funds rather than having it enter the pockets of their Florentine backers. Thus began an insurrection and secession from Florence, which involved putting to death several opposing citizens. Lorenzo sent mercenaries to suppress the revolt by force, and the mercenaries ultimately sacked the city.

Although Lorenzo did not commission many works himself, he helped these artists to secure commissions from other patrons. Michelangelo lived with Lorenzo and his family for three years, dining at the family table and participating in discussions led by [[Marsilio Ficino]].\n\nLorenzo himself was an artist and wrote poetry in his native [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]].

First the [[Roman Curia]] in 1462, and then Lorenzo and the Medici Bank less than a year later, got involved in backing the mining operation, with the pope taking a two-ducat commission for each cantar [[quintal]] of alum retrieved and ensuring a monopoly against the Turkish-derived goods by prohibiting trade in alum with infidels.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Decline of the Medici Bank, 1397\u20131494|last=de Roover|first=Raymond|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1963|isbn=|location=|pages=152\u2013154}}</ref> When they realized the value of the alum mine, the people of Volterra wanted its revenues for their municipal funds rather than having it enter the pockets of their Florentine backers. Thus began an insurrection and secession from Florence, which involved putting to death several opposing citizens. Lorenzo sent mercenaries to suppress the revolt by force, and the mercenaries ultimately sacked the city. Lorenzo hurried to Volterra to make amends, but the incident would remain a dark stain on his record.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/florentinehistor02machuoft|title=The Florentine history|last=Machiavelli|first=Niccol\u00f2|date=1906|publisher=London : A.

Although Lorenzo did not commission many works himself, he helped these artists to secure commissions from other patrons. Michelangelo lived with Lorenzo and his family for three years, dining at the family table and participating in discussions led by [[Marsilio Ficino]].\n\nLorenzo himself was an artist and wrote poetry in his native [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]. In his poetry, he celebrates life while acknowledging with melancholy the fragility and instability of the human condition, particularly in his later works.

Upham]], Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Asiatic Fleet (front row, center), and his staff officers, c. 1935]]\n\nThe '''United States Asiatic Fleet''' was a [[Naval fleet|fleet]] of the [[United States Navy]] during much of the first half of the 20th century. Before [[World War II]], the fleet patrolled the [[Philippine Islands]]. Much of the fleet was destroyed by the Japanese by February 1942, after which it was [[Disestablished commands of the United States Navy|dissolved and incorporated]] into the naval component of the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area command]], which eventually became the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]].\n\nThe fleet was created when its predecessor, the [[Asiatic Squadron]], was upgraded to fleet status in 1902. In early 1907, the fleet was downgraded and became the First [[Squadron (naval)|Squadron]] of the [[United States Pacific Fleet]]. However, on 28 January 1910, the ships of that squadron were again organized as the Asiatic Fleet. Thus constituted, the Asiatic Fleet, based in the Philippines, was organizationally independent of the Pacific Fleet, which was based on the [[United States West Coast]] until it moved to [[Pearl Harbor]] in the [[Territory of Hawaii]] in 1940.\n\nAlthough much smaller than any other U.S. Navy fleet and indeed far smaller than what any navy generally considers to be a [[Naval fleet|fleet]], the Asiatic Fleet from 1916 was commanded by one of only four four-star [[Admiral (United States)|admirals]] authorized in the U.S. Navy at the time. This reflected the prestige of the position of Asiatic Fleet commander-in-chief, who generally was more powerful and influential with regard to the affairs of the [[United States]] in [[China]] than was the American [[Minister (government)|minister]], or later [[United States Ambassador]], to China.<ref>Foreword by Kemp Tolley in Winslow, p. ''xii''.</ref>\n\n==1902\u20131907==\nIn 1904, all [[armored cruiser]]s were withdrawn from the [[Far East]]. [[Gunboat]]s patrolled the [[Yangtze River]] in the [[Yangtze Patrol]].\n\nAfter [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Charles J. Train]] became commander-in-chief of the fleet in March 1905, it was involved in various ways with the closing weeks of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905. After the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s decisive defeat of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the [[Battle of Tsushima Strait]] in May 1905, units of the Asiatic Fleet escorted three fleeing Russian [[cruiser]]s into [[Manila Bay]] in the [[Philippine Islands]], where Train ensured that their crews were well taken care of during a lengthy stay until they were able to return to [[Russian Empire|Russia]].<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\">Anonymous, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/08/04/101792119.pdf \"Admiral Train Dies at Che-Foo, China\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 4 August 1906.</ref>\n\nIn November 1905, Train was at the center of a diplomatic dispute while with a group of American officers on a [[pheasant]]-hunting expedition near [[Nanking]], [[Chinese Empire|China]], when he accidentally shot a Chinese woman with [[birdshot]], inflicting minor injuries on her. A mob of hundreds of Chinese villagers formed around Train{{'}}s party and attacked it, pushing Train into the mud, seizing the officers' guns, and taking Train's son, Navy Lieutenant Charles R. Train, hostage. When the Asiatic Fleet landed 40 [[United States Marines]] to rescue the officers, the villagers attacked them with [[pitchfork]]s and the Marines fired two shots. Local Chinese officials refused to return the officers' guns, but Train and his companions were able to extricate themselves without further injury to anyone. The governor of Nanking later apologized for the mob's actions, returned the American officers' guns, and punished the ringleaders of the mob.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\"/><ref>''Tenth report of the Secretary of the Class of 1865 of Harvard College, July 1900 to July 1907'', Boston: Geo.

The visit, urged by the Soviet government, was an attempt to display solidarity between the Soviet Union and the United States in the face of increasingly aggressive Japanese behavior in [[China]] and along the border between the Soviet Union and the Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] in [[Manchuria]]. The visit was unsuccessful in deterring further Japanese military operations in either area.<ref>Russell, Richard A., ''Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan'', Washington, D.C.: [[Naval Historical Center]], 1997, {{ISBN|0-945274-35-1}}, p. 3.</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nOn 25 July 1939,<ref>{{cite book|last=Leutze|first=James|title=A Different Kind of Victory: A Biography of Admiral Thomas C.

The relationship between the U.S. and China was mostly on-again off-again, with periods of both cordial diplomatic relations accompanied by times of severed relations and violent anti-United States protests. China's central government was relatively weak in comparison to the local influence of regional warlords. Armed renegade soldiers and boatmen prowled the Yangtze River ready to seize any vessel unable to defend itself.<ref name=tsw>{{cite journal |last=Wylly |first=Thomas S. |authorlink = |year=1986 |title=The Pearl of the Orient |journal=Proceedings |volume=112 |issue=2 |pages=138&139 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] }}</ref>\n\nThe cooks, bakers, stewards, and [[mess]] attendants were exclusively Chinese aboard all gunboats and cruisers in Chinese waters. These men did not wear naval uniforms, but wore traditional Chinese civilian attire. They wore black satin slippers and a [[Beanie (seamed cap)|skullcap]] with a decorative button on top. The remainder of their clothing was made of white satin, consisting of long, rather loose pantaloons tied around the ankles and a short jacket fastened in front with [[Frog (fastening)|frogs]]. Not considered part of the ships' crew were the Chinese girls who lived aboard sampans tied to the stern of each gunboat while moored at Shanghai. These sampans would shuttle members of the gunboat crew ashore upon request. The girls also painted the gunboat and polished [[brightwork]] in exchange for the ship's [[garbage]].<ref name=tsw/>\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the Asiatic Fleet was based from China, and a classic image of the \"China Sailor\" developed, as a large number of U.S. Navy members would remain at postings in China for 10\u201312&nbsp;years then retire and continue to live in the country. The classic film ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'' is a dramatization on the life of the China Sailors.\n\nThe U.S. military also created several awards and decorations to recognize those personnel who had performed duty in China. The [[China Service Medal]], [[China Campaign Medal]], [[Yangtze Service Medal]], and the [[China Relief Expedition Medal]] were all military medals which could be presented to those who had performed duty in China.\n\nWith the approach of [[World War II]], the U.S. military in China was slowly withdrawn to protect other U.S. interests in the Pacific. With the rise of Communist China, there was no further U.S. military presence in mainland China, a status which continues to this day.\n\nEarly in November 1941, the [[Navy Department]] ordered Hart to withdraw the fleet's [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and gunboats stationed in China. Five of the gunboats were moved to Manila, {{USS|Wake|PG-43|2}} was left with a skeleton crew as a radio base and was seized by the Japanese on 8 December and {{USS|Tutuila|PG-44|2}} was transferred to the Republic of China Navy under [[Lend-Lease]].\n\nThe majority of the [[US 4th Marine Regiment|4th Marine Regiment]] was stationed at Shanghai, and other detachments were at [[Beijing|Peking]] (Beijing) and [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] (Tianjin). These troops were loaded onto two passenger liners, {{SS|President Madison|1921|2}} and {{SS|President Harrison|1921|2}}, on 27\u201328 November (at either Shanghai or [[Qinghuangdao|Chinwangtao]] (Qinghuangdao) and arrived in the Philippines on 30 November-1 December.\n\n''President Harrison'' returned to Chinwangtao, to move the remaining Marines, but was captured by the Japanese on 7 December. Those Marines who had reached the Philippines were tasked with defending the naval stations, particularly [[Mariveles Naval Section Base|Mariveles Naval Base]].\n\n===Minefields===\n\nManila Bay and [[Subic Bay]] had [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense|Army-operated minefields]] as well as [[naval mine]]s. The Army minefields were operated by the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery]]'s [[Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays]]. These minefields were designed to stop all vessels except [[submarine]]s and shallow-draft surface craft.

By Mid-1941, these 28 PBYs were numbered 1 through 14 for VP 101, 16 through 29 for VP 102. The Utility Unit included [[Grumman J2F Duck]] [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibians]] (1 J2F-2 and 4 J2F-4s), as well as five new [[Vought OS2U Kingfisher|Vought OS2U-2 Kingfisher]] [[floatplane]]s, delivered in the late summer. Also, a number of [[Curtiss SOC Seagull]] floatplanes were present. ''Houston'' carried four, ''Marblehead'' two, and ''Langley'' two or three, and two more were under repair or in storage at the Aircraft Overhaul Shop (Shop X 34) at Cavite Navy Yard.\n\nAs of 8 December, PBYs of Patrol Wing 10 patrolled the northwest and northeast of Luzon daily. These flights were based at either [[Naval Air Station Sangley Point|NAS Sangley Point]], the Navy's auxiliary seaplane station at Olongapo on [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]], or seaplane tender ''Childs'' in Manila Bay. Trios of PBYs rotated down to the southern islands to base on ''William B. Preston'' at [[Malalag Bay]] on [[Davao Gulf]], [[Mindanao]]. These patrols over the [[Philippine Sea]] to the east bordered with similar patrols flown by [[Royal Netherlands Naval Air Service]] flying boats based in the Netherlands East Indies. Seaplane tender ''Heron'', with a detachment of four OS2U-2s from the Utility Unit, ran morning and evening patrols from [[Port Ciego]], [[Balabac Island]], over the strategically important [[Balabac Straits]] from 4\u201313 December.\n\nEarly in the morning of 8 December, ''Preston'' dispatched one aircraft on patrol and a short time later was attacked by aircraft from the small Japanese [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ry\u016bj\u014d||2}}, and her other two PBYs were sunk on the water.\n\nPatrol Wing 10 was ordered south into the [[Netherlands East Indies]] on 12 December, when the collapsing defenses of the islands made further operations untenable. Within the first 90 days of the war, Patrol Wing 10 had fallen back to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]], being reinforced by VP&nbsp;22 from Hawaii but losing 43 of 45 PBYs\u2014all but four lost to enemy action\u2014together with ''Langley''.\n\n*PBY-4 (28.

Of the five remaining gunboats, {{USS|Tutuila|PR-4|2}} remained at [[Chungking]], {{USS|Wake|PR-3|2}} was in reduced commission at Shanghai as a radio station for the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], and ComYangPat sailed in {{USS|Luzon|PG-47|2}} with ''Oahu'' for Manila, joined by {{USS|Mindanao|PR-8|2}}.\n\n===Battles fought by the Asiatic Fleet: early 1942===\nAs the Japanese sought sources of oil and minerals in the Netherlands East Indies and Borneo immediately following Pearl Harbor, the only fleet available to defend against them was the Asiatic Fleet. Outnumbered, outgunned, outmanned, the U.S. Navy, part of the ABDA (American, British, Dutch and Australian) force was unable to stop the Japanese, and could only attempt to slow them down.\n\n====Battle of Balikpapan: 24 January 1942====\n{{Main|Naval Battle of Balikpapan}}\n\nCatching a Japanese invasion fleet of 16 transports, a cruiser and several destroyers anchored in Balikpapan Bay, four U.S. \"four stacker\" destroyers\u2014{{USS|John D.

The Japanese believed that the attack came from submarines, and sent cruiser and destroyers out to sea in pursuit, leaving the transports unprotected. This was the first American surface action of the Pacific War and the first since the Spanish\u2013American War. Although it significantly boosted morale, it had a negligible effect on Japanese operations.<ref>{{cite web|first=Dan |last=Muir |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/BalikpapanRaid.html |title=The Balikpapan Raid |date=1999\u20132000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Flores Sea: 4 February 1942====\n{{Main|Battle of Makassar Strait}}\n\nEncouraged by the success of the Balikpapan raid, an attempt was made to break up another invasion when word was received that a Japanese force was planning a landing at [[Makassar]] on [[Sulawesi|Celebes Island]].\n\nPlanning a night attack, the ABDA force had to sail some distance in open water in daylight. It was attacked by Japanese bombers which severely damaged the light cruiser {{USS|Marblehead|CL-12|2}} and disabled turret No. 3 on the heavy cruiser {{USS|Houston|CA-30|2}}. The force retreated to [[Cilacap Regency|Tjilatjap]], Java, having failed to prevent the Japanese landing.\n\n====Battle of Badung Strait: 19/20 February 1942====\n{{Main|Battle of Badung Strait}}\n\nIn an effort to break up another invasion, a small force of ABDA ships arrived on the island of [[Bali]] after the Japanese had made their landing and had retired, leaving only four Japanese destroyers on station.

Upham]], Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Asiatic Fleet (front row, center), and his staff officers, c. 1935]]\n\nThe '''United States Asiatic Fleet''' was a [[Naval fleet|fleet]] of the [[United States Navy]] during much of the first half of the 20th century. Before [[World War II]], the fleet patrolled the [[Philippine Islands]]. Much of the fleet was destroyed by the Japanese by February 1942, after which it was [[Disestablished commands of the United States Navy|dissolved and incorporated]] into the naval component of the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area command]], which eventually became the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]].\n\nThe fleet was created when its predecessor, the [[Asiatic Squadron]], was upgraded to fleet status in 1902. In early 1907, the fleet was downgraded and became the First [[Squadron (naval)|Squadron]] of the [[United States Pacific Fleet]]. However, on 28 January 1910, the ships of that squadron were again organized as the Asiatic Fleet. Thus constituted, the Asiatic Fleet, based in the Philippines, was organizationally independent of the Pacific Fleet, which was based on the [[United States West Coast]] until it moved to [[Pearl Harbor]] in the [[Territory of Hawaii]] in 1940.\n\nAlthough much smaller than any other U.S. Navy fleet and indeed far smaller than what any navy generally considers to be a [[Naval fleet|fleet]], the Asiatic Fleet from 1916 was commanded by one of only four four-star [[Admiral (United States)|admirals]] authorized in the U.S. Navy at the time. This reflected the prestige of the position of Asiatic Fleet commander-in-chief, who generally was more powerful and influential with regard to the affairs of the [[United States]] in [[China]] than was the American [[Minister (government)|minister]], or later [[United States Ambassador]], to China.<ref>Foreword by Kemp Tolley in Winslow, p. ''xii''.</ref>\n\n==1902\u20131907==\nIn 1904, all [[armored cruiser]]s were withdrawn from the [[Far East]]. [[Gunboat]]s patrolled the [[Yangtze River]] in the [[Yangtze Patrol]].\n\nAfter [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Charles J. Train]] became commander-in-chief of the fleet in March 1905, it was involved in various ways with the closing weeks of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905. After the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s decisive defeat of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the [[Battle of Tsushima Strait]] in May 1905, units of the Asiatic Fleet escorted three fleeing Russian [[cruiser]]s into [[Manila Bay]] in the [[Philippine Islands]], where Train ensured that their crews were well taken care of during a lengthy stay until they were able to return to [[Russian Empire|Russia]].<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\">Anonymous, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/08/04/101792119.pdf \"Admiral Train Dies at Che-Foo, China\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 4 August 1906.</ref>\n\nIn November 1905, Train was at the center of a diplomatic dispute while with a group of American officers on a [[pheasant]]-hunting expedition near [[Nanking]], [[Chinese Empire|China]], when he accidentally shot a Chinese woman with [[birdshot]], inflicting minor injuries on her. A mob of hundreds of Chinese villagers formed around Train{{'}}s party and attacked it, pushing Train into the mud, seizing the officers' guns, and taking Train's son, Navy Lieutenant Charles R. Train, hostage. When the Asiatic Fleet landed 40 [[United States Marines]] to rescue the officers, the villagers attacked them with [[pitchfork]]s and the Marines fired two shots. Local Chinese officials refused to return the officers' guns, but Train and his companions were able to extricate themselves without further injury to anyone. The governor of Nanking later apologized for the mob's actions, returned the American officers' guns, and punished the ringleaders of the mob.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\"/><ref>''Tenth report of the Secretary of the Class of 1865 of Harvard College, July 1900 to July 1907'', Boston: Geo.

Yarnell]], took his [[flagship]], the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Augusta|CA-31|2}}, to the [[Soviet Union]]'s main naval base in the [[Soviet Pacific Fleet|Pacific]], [[Vladivostok]], along with four of the fleet's [[destroyer]]s. The visit, urged by the Soviet government, was an attempt to display solidarity between the Soviet Union and the United States in the face of increasingly aggressive Japanese behavior in [[China]] and along the border between the Soviet Union and the Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] in [[Manchuria]]. The visit was unsuccessful in deterring further Japanese military operations in either area.<ref>Russell, Richard A., ''Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan'', Washington, D.C.: [[Naval Historical Center]], 1997, {{ISBN|0-945274-35-1}}, p. 3.</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nOn 25 July 1939,<ref>{{cite book|last=Leutze|first=James|title=A Different Kind of Victory: A Biography of Admiral Thomas C.

Hart]] was appointed the commander-in-chief of the fleet. It was based at [[Cavite Naval Base]] and [[Olongapo Naval Station]] on [[Luzon]], with its headquarters at the [[Marsman Building]] in [[Manila]]. On 22 July 1941, the [[Mariveles Naval Section Base|Mariveles Naval Base]] was completed and the Asiatic Fleet began to use it as well.\n\nHart had permission to withdraw to the [[Indian Ocean]], in the event of war with [[Japan]], at his discretion.\n\nHart's [[submarine]]s, commanded by Commander, Submarines, Asiatic Fleet (<small>[[ComSubAF|COMSUBAF]]</small>) [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[John E.

The relationship between the U.S. and China was mostly on-again off-again, with periods of both cordial diplomatic relations accompanied by times of severed relations and violent anti-United States protests. China's central government was relatively weak in comparison to the local influence of regional warlords. Armed renegade soldiers and boatmen prowled the Yangtze River ready to seize any vessel unable to defend itself.<ref name=tsw>{{cite journal |last=Wylly |first=Thomas S. |authorlink = |year=1986 |title=The Pearl of the Orient |journal=Proceedings |volume=112 |issue=2 |pages=138&139 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] }}</ref>\n\nThe cooks, bakers, stewards, and [[mess]] attendants were exclusively Chinese aboard all gunboats and cruisers in Chinese waters. These men did not wear naval uniforms, but wore traditional Chinese civilian attire. They wore black satin slippers and a [[Beanie (seamed cap)|skullcap]] with a decorative button on top. The remainder of their clothing was made of white satin, consisting of long, rather loose pantaloons tied around the ankles and a short jacket fastened in front with [[Frog (fastening)|frogs]]. Not considered part of the ships' crew were the Chinese girls who lived aboard sampans tied to the stern of each gunboat while moored at Shanghai. These sampans would shuttle members of the gunboat crew ashore upon request. The girls also painted the gunboat and polished [[brightwork]] in exchange for the ship's [[garbage]].<ref name=tsw/>\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the Asiatic Fleet was based from China, and a classic image of the \"China Sailor\" developed, as a large number of U.S. Navy members would remain at postings in China for 10\u201312&nbsp;years then retire and continue to live in the country. The classic film ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'' is a dramatization on the life of the China Sailors.\n\nThe U.S. military also created several awards and decorations to recognize those personnel who had performed duty in China. The [[China Service Medal]], [[China Campaign Medal]], [[Yangtze Service Medal]], and the [[China Relief Expedition Medal]] were all military medals which could be presented to those who had performed duty in China.\n\nWith the approach of [[World War II]], the U.S. military in China was slowly withdrawn to protect other U.S. interests in the Pacific. With the rise of Communist China, there was no further U.S. military presence in mainland China, a status which continues to this day.\n\nEarly in November 1941, the [[Navy Department]] ordered Hart to withdraw the fleet's [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and gunboats stationed in China. Five of the gunboats were moved to Manila, {{USS|Wake|PG-43|2}} was left with a skeleton crew as a radio base and was seized by the Japanese on 8 December and {{USS|Tutuila|PG-44|2}} was transferred to the Republic of China Navy under [[Lend-Lease]].\n\nThe majority of the [[US 4th Marine Regiment|4th Marine Regiment]] was stationed at Shanghai, and other detachments were at [[Beijing|Peking]] (Beijing) and [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] (Tianjin). These troops were loaded onto two passenger liners, {{SS|President Madison|1921|2}} and {{SS|President Harrison|1921|2}}, on 27\u201328 November (at either Shanghai or [[Qinghuangdao|Chinwangtao]] (Qinghuangdao) and arrived in the Philippines on 30 November-1 December.\n\n''President Harrison'' returned to Chinwangtao, to move the remaining Marines, but was captured by the Japanese on 7 December. Those Marines who had reached the Philippines were tasked with defending the naval stations, particularly [[Mariveles Naval Section Base|Mariveles Naval Base]].\n\n===Minefields===\n\nManila Bay and [[Subic Bay]] had [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense|Army-operated minefields]] as well as [[naval mine]]s. The Army minefields were operated by the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery]]'s [[Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays]]. These minefields were designed to stop all vessels except [[submarine]]s and shallow-draft surface craft. In Manila Bay, two controlled minefields were placed, one between Corregidor and [[La Monja Island]]s, and the other between Corregidor Island and the [[Bataan]] Peninsula east of [[Mariveles, Bataan#Geography|Mariveles Bay]], both operated from Corregidor. Also, in mid-1941 US Navy minefields of contact mines were laid between Mariveles Bay and La Monja Island, and between Corregidor and [[Fort Frank|Carabao Islands]].<ref>Lewis, pp. 83-89</ref><ref>[http://www.northamericanforts.com/West/pi.html Forts in the Philippines at American Forts Network]</ref> The Subic Bay minefield was laid in July 1941 and operated from [[Fort Wint]], with the controlled Army mines in the ship channel, and naval mines to the sides of the channel.<ref name=BogartSubicp2>[http://corregidor.org/chs_bogart/bogart1b.htm Bogart, Charles M., ''Subic Bay and Fort Wint: Keys to Manila'', p. 2 at Corregidor.org]</ref>\n\n===Vessels of the Asiatic Fleet and the 16th Naval District: 8 December 1941===\nThe Asiatic Fleet and the [[16th Naval District]] possessed:<ref>{{cite web|first =David X.|last=Wright|title=United States Asiatic Fleet Order of Battle, December 1941 |url=http://www.asiaticfleet.com/orbat.htm|website= The United States Asiatic Fleet|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*1 [[heavy cruiser]]\n**{{USS|Houston|CA-30|2}}\n*1 [[light cruiser]]\n**{{USS|Marblehead|CL-12|2}}\n*13 {{sclass-|Clemson|destroyer}}s:\n**{{USS|Paul Jones|DD-230|2}}\n**{{USS|John D.

These flights were based at either [[Naval Air Station Sangley Point|NAS Sangley Point]], the Navy's auxiliary seaplane station at Olongapo on [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]], or seaplane tender ''Childs'' in Manila Bay. Trios of PBYs rotated down to the southern islands to base on ''William B. Preston'' at [[Malalag Bay]] on [[Davao Gulf]], [[Mindanao]]. These patrols over the [[Philippine Sea]] to the east bordered with similar patrols flown by [[Royal Netherlands Naval Air Service]] flying boats based in the Netherlands East Indies. Seaplane tender ''Heron'', with a detachment of four OS2U-2s from the Utility Unit, ran morning and evening patrols from [[Port Ciego]], [[Balabac Island]], over the strategically important [[Balabac Straits]] from 4\u201313 December.\n\nEarly in the morning of 8 December, ''Preston'' dispatched one aircraft on patrol and a short time later was attacked by aircraft from the small Japanese [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ry\u016bj\u014d||2}}, and her other two PBYs were sunk on the water.\n\nPatrol Wing 10 was ordered south into the [[Netherlands East Indies]] on 12 December, when the collapsing defenses of the islands made further operations untenable. Within the first 90 days of the war, Patrol Wing 10 had fallen back to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]], being reinforced by VP&nbsp;22 from Hawaii but losing 43 of 45 PBYs\u2014all but four lost to enemy action\u2014together with ''Langley''.\n\n*PBY-4 (28.

The Japanese believed that the attack came from submarines, and sent cruiser and destroyers out to sea in pursuit, leaving the transports unprotected.

{"title_page": "Kart racing", "text_new": "{{short description|Road racing using go-karts}}\n{{redirect|Kart}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2012}}\n'''Kart racing''' or '''karting''' is a variant of [[motorsport]] [[road racing]] with [[open-wheel]], four-wheeled vehicles known as [[go-kart]]s or shifter karts. They are usually raced on [[kart circuit|scaled-down circuits]], although some professional kart races are also held on full-size motorsport circuits. Karting is commonly perceived as the stepping stone to the higher ranks of motorsports, with former [[Formula One]] champions such as [[Sebastian Vettel]], [[Nico Rosberg]], [[Ayrton Senna]], [[Lewis Hamilton]], [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Fernando Alonso]] having begun their careers in karting.\n\nKarts vary widely in speed and some (known as [[superkart]]s) can reach speeds exceeding {{convert|260|km/h|mph}}, while recreational go-karts intended for the general public may be limited to lower speeds.\n\n[[File:Fina mundial.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Rotax World Final kart racing]]\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Photography by Victor Albert Grigas (1919-2017)00025 sept 62 (37295972680).jpg|thumb|right|Kart racing in [[Illinois]] in 1962]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B1007-0016-001, 5.

Its first engine, the McCulloch MC-10,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macbobaust.com/kart_engines.html |title=The McCulloch Kart Engines |publisher=Macbobaust.com |date=2002-09-15 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> was an adapted [[chainsaw]] [[two-stroke engine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagekarts.com/mcstory.htm |title=1959 \u2013 McCulloch's Entry into Kart Racing |publisher=Vintagekarts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> Later, in the 1960s, [[motorcycle]] engines were also adapted for kart use, before dedicated manufacturers, especially in Italy ([[Italian American Motor Engineering|IAME]]), started to build engines for the sport.\n\n== Components ==\n\n=== Chassis ===\nThe [[chassis]] are made of chrome moly tubing.<ref>[http://www.haase.it/download/Haase26-CH-11.pdf Example of a CIK-FIA homologation form] \u2013 Chassis, 2005</ref><ref name=\"chassis\">[http://www.cometkartsales.com/store/chassis/cpa/images/margayparts/margay17top.jpg Technical picture of a racing chassis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411105033/http://www.cometkartsales.com/store/chassis/cpa/images/margayparts/margay17top.jpg |date=11 April 2008 }} \u2013 [[Margay Products Inc.|Margay]] chassis</ref> There is no [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] so chassis have to be flexible enough to work as a suspension and stiff enough not to break or give way on a turn. Kart chassis are classified in the United States as 'Open', 'Caged', 'Straight' or 'Offset'. All [[Commission Internationale de Karting]] - [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] or CIK-FIA approved chassis are 'Straight' and 'Open'.\n\n*Open karts have no roll cage.\n*Caged karts have a [[roll cage]] surrounding the driver; they are mostly used on dirt tracks.\n*In Straight chassis the driver sits in the center. Straight chassis are used for [[Kart racing#Sprint|sprint racing]].\n*In Offset chassis the driver sits on the left side. Offset chassis are used for left-turn-only [[Oval track|speedway]] racing.\n\nThe stiffness of the chassis enables different handling characteristics for different circumstances. Typically, for dry conditions a stiffer chassis is preferable, while in wet or other poor traction conditions, a more flexible chassis may work better. Temperature of the track can also affect handling and may prompt additional chassis adjustments. The best chassis allow for stiffening bars at the rear, front and side to be added or removed according to race conditions.<ref>https://www.kartpartsdepot.com/product_p/007.htm</ref>\n\nBraking is achieved by a [[disc brake]] mounted on the rear axle. Front disc brakes are used in most shifter kart classes and are increasingly popular in other classes; however, certain classes do not allow them. Shifter karts have dual master cylinders, one for the front and one for the rear and are adjustable to allow for front/rear bias changes.\n\nProfessionally raced karts typically weigh {{convert|165|to|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, complete without driver. [[Avanti Kart|Avanti]], [[Tony Kart]], [[Jarno Trulli|Trulli]], [[Birel]], [[CRG (kart manufacturer)|CRG]], [[Gillard (kart manufacturer)|Gillard]], [[Intrepid Kart|Intrepid]], [[Kosmic Kart|Kosmic]], [[Alex Zanardi|Zanardi]] or [[Fernando Alonso|FA Kart]] and [[EKS Motorsport|EKS]] are a few well known examples of the many European manufacturers of race-quality chassis. Emmick, Coyote, Bandit, Shadow, MGM, Titan, PRC and [[Margay Products Inc.|Margay]] are American companies producing kart chassis.\n\n=== Engines ===\n[[File:Shifter_Kart_Engine.jpg|thumb|Shifter kart engine]]\nAmusement park [[go-kart]]s can be powered by four-stroke [[Internal combustion engine|engines]] or [[electric motor]]s, while racing karts use small two-stroke or four-stroke engines.\n\n* [[Four-stroke engine]]s can be standard air-cooled industrial based engines, sometimes with small modifications, developing from about 5 to 20&nbsp;hp. [[Briggs & Stratton]], Tecumseh, Kohler, Robin, and [[Honda]] are manufacturers of such engines. They are adequate for racing and fun kart applications. There are also more powerful four-stroke engines available from manufacturers like [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]], TKM, [[Swissauto]] or Aixro ([[Wankel engine]]) offering from 15&nbsp;hp up to 48&nbsp;hp. They run to and around 11,000 rpm, and are manufactured specifically for karting. Those are used in some National Championship classes like the two-strokes.\n* [[Two-stroke engine|Two-stroke]] kart engines are developed and built by dedicated manufacturers. WTP, Comer, [[Italian American Motor Engineering|IAME]] (Parilla, Komet, Woltjer), TM, Vortex, Titan, REFO, Modena Engines, TKM, [[PRD Fireball|PRD]], [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] and [[Rotax]] are manufacturers of such engines. These can develop from about 8&nbsp;hp for a single-cylinder 60 cc unit (MiniROK by Vortex) to over 90&nbsp;hp for a twin 250 cc.<<ref name=\"Superkart\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parcferme.com/content/view/2663/2/ |title=Superkart at Magny-Cours \u2013 2007 |publisher=Parcferme.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> Today, the most popular categories worldwide are those using the TaG 125 cc units.

This is achieved by designing the chassis so that the inside rear tire lifts up slightly when the kart turns the corner. This allows the tire to lose some of its grip and slide or lift off the ground completely.\n\nPower is transmitted from the engine to the rear axle by a chain. Both engine and axle [[sprockets]] are removable. Their ratio must be adapted to the track configuration to obtain the most from the engine.\n\nIn the early days, karts were direct drive (requiring push starts). The inconvenience of that configuration led to the [[centrifugal clutch]] for the club level classes. Dry centrifugal clutches are now used in many categories ([[Rotax Max]] is one example) and have become the norm as the top international classes have switched to 125&nbsp;cc clutched engines as of January 2007.\n\n=== Tires ===\nWheels and [[tire]]s are much smaller than those used on a normal car. Rims are made of [[magnesium]] alloy, [[aluminum]], or [[composite material]]s. Tires can support cornering forces in excess of 2 [[Gravity of Earth|g]] (20&nbsp;m/s\u00b2), depending on chassis, engine, and motor [[Racing setup|setup]]. Some car tire manufacturers, such as [[Bridgestone]], [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]], and [[Maxxis]] make tires for karts. There are also specific kart tire manufacturers, which include MG, MOJO, Vega, Hoosier and Burris.\n\nSimilar to other motorsports, kart tires have different types for use appropriate to track conditions:\n* [[Slick tire|Slicks]], for dry track. Slick kart tires come in many different compounds, from very soft (maximum grip) to very hard (amusement and rental karts, less grip but long life span). In international level racing, because the drivers are free to choose their tires<ref>[http://www.cikfiachampionship.com/news.asp?id=77 Latest decisions of the FIA World Motor Sport Council concerning Karting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926005547/http://www.cikfiachampionship.com/news.asp?id=77 |date=26 September 2014 }} - CIK-FIA, 15 March 2012</ref> and because of the short duration of each round (10 to 20 minutes  maximum), these are some of the softest tires found in motorsport.\n* [[Rain tire]]s, or \"wets\", for wet weather. They are grooved, made of soft compound, and are narrower than slicks. Not all racing classes allow rain tires.\n* Special, such as spiked tires for icy conditions, or \"cuts/grooved\" for high grip dirt/clay speedways. Cuts are slicks modified with a [[lathe]] to optimize handling. Tire manufacturers such as Hoosier and Burris also make a slightly larger grooved tire only used in dirt track racing.\n\n=== Data acquisition ===\n\nAs in other motor sports, several data acquisition systems have been developed for kart racing. These systems allow the driver to monitor from a display fixed on the steering wheel some parameters such as RPM, timing of laps (including sectors), number of laps, best lap, cooling system temperature, exhaust gas temperature and sometimes speed or even gear for shifter karts.\n\nSome of those systems are able to record (logging) laps data from the sensors, allowing replay of an entire running session or/and direct download to a personal computer equipped with a data analysis software. More sophisticated systems allow for more information such as lateral and longitudinal acceleration ([[g-force]]), throttle position, steering wheel position and brake pressure.\n\n== Racing ==\n[[File:KartingNSKC.jpg|thumb|Sprint race at Eastern Creek, Australia]]\n[[File:Rotax Max1.jpg|thumb|Maximilien Blank and his team-mate Jason Trulo (sprint)]]\nKart racing is generally accepted as the most economic form of [[motorsport]] available on four wheels. As a free-time activity, it can be performed by almost anybody, and as a motorsport in itself, it is one of the sports regulated by [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] (under the name of [[Commission Internationale de Karting|CIK]]), permitting licensed racing for anyone from the age of 8 onward.\n\nIn the United States, there is not as much FIA involvement; instead, many organizations regulate racing, such as the IKF ([[International Kart Federation]]), WKA ([[World Karting Association]]), KART (Karters of America Racing Triad), USPKS (United States Pro Karting Series).\n\nIn the UK, the [[Motor Sports Association]] (MSA) regulates most 'owner driver' Karting. Some associations, such as [[Natska|NatSKA]] (National Schools Karting Association), organize race meetings throughout the country under the authority of the MSA.\nVarious four-stroke 'hire kart' series such as EPEC (European Prokart Endurance Championship)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teessidekarting.co.uk/European-pro-kart.php |title=European Endurance Prokart Championship (EPEC) |publisher=Teessidekarting.co.uk |accessdate=2011-08-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908011101/http://www.teessidekarting.co.uk/European-pro-kart.php |archivedate=8 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> or BRKC (British Rental Kart Championship)<ref>{{cite web |author=Bradley Philpot |url=http://www.brkc.net |title=British Rental Kart Championship |publisher=BRKC |accessdate=2011-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224094952/http://brkc.net/ |archive-date=24 December 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> fall outside the governance of the MSA. Billed as the UK's first national karting ''league,'' the Elite Karting League also falls outside of MSA governance.\n\nIn Australia, kart racing is administered by the [[Australian Karting Association]] on the behalf of FIA and [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]]. There is a manual released every year detailing the various rules and regulations that race meetings and drivers have to follow.\n\nRacing classes start at age 7 or 8 (5 in the US with \"Kid Karts\") and generally run in 3-year age groupings or weight divisions until \"senior\" status is reached at age 15 or 16, depending on the series.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n=== Racing formats ===\nTypically, race formats are one of the following:\n\n==== Sprint ====\nSprint racing takes place on dedicated kart circuits resembling small road courses, with left and right turns. Tracks range from 1/4 mile (400 metres) to over 1 mile (1,600 metres) in length.\n\nThe sprint format is a series of short-duration races, normally for a small number of laps, that qualify for a final, with a variety of point scoring calculations to determine the event's overall winner. Typical duration does not normally exceed 15 minutes. Here, speed and successful passing is of the most importance. It normally occurs in the format of three qualifying heats and a final race for trophy positions.\n\nThe [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] championships, including the [[Karting World Championship]], take place in this format.\n\n==== Endurance ====\n[[File:enduros.jpg|thumb|Pack of laydown enduros at [[Daytona International Speedway]]]]\nEndurance races last for an extended period, ranging from 30 minutes up to 24 hours or more, for one or more drivers. In general, consistency, reliability, and pit strategy is of greater importance than all out speed.\n\nCalled \"enduro\" racing in the United States, most [[World Karting Association|WKA]] and [[International Kart Federation|IKF]] sanctioned events typically last 30 minutes (sprint enduro) or 45 minutes (laydown enduro) and are run continuously without pit stops. Enduro events are held on full-size road racing circuits that are usually between 1.5 and 4 miles in length.\n\nAs well as the famous [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race for automobiles there is also a 24-hours event for karts which takes place at the kart circuit Alain Prost at [[Le Mans]], France.<ref> [http://www.circuitalainprost.com Kart circuit Alain Prost \u2013 24 hours] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106063535/http://www.circuitalainprost.com/ |date=6 January 2008 }}</ref> This race has taken place since 1986 and its winners list include four-time [[Champ Car]] champion  [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]] (in 1996).\n\nEndurance racing is also considered a more affordable way of getting into karting. In South Africa, the 24 Hours of Karting Festival race is held annually and lasts 24 hours with multiple classes participating. This event is hosted by the Prokart SSS Club <ref>[http://www.prokartsss.co.za Prokart SSS]</ref> near Johannesburg. The most popular class runs the Honda GX390 four-stroke engine, which is both affordable and durable, keeping running costs to a minimum. The Prokart Super Single Series, also known as Prokart SSS, has been running for more than 20 years and has proven to be a very popular entry platform for drivers of all ages who want to get into karting. Many clubs worldwide have taken on four-stroke endurance karting for this reason, since two-stroke karting can be very expensive.\n\n==== Speedway ====\nSpeedway racing takes place on [[asphalt]] or clay [[oval (geometry)|oval]] tracks which are normally between 1/10 mile and 1/4 mile long. Tracks primarily consist of two straights and four left-turn corners, few tracks are symmetric and often the shape parallels that of an egg or a [[tri-oval]].\n\n'Offset' kart chassis have been developed for precise handling and adjustability in left-turn-only racing competition taking place on oval and tri-oval tracks. Depending on the track material, different tires are used on the kart. <ref>https://www.kartpartsdepot.com/Introduction_to_Go_Kart_Tires_p/81.htm</ref> \n\nSpeedway kart races range in length from 4 laps for a trophy dash, to 20 laps for a main event.\n\nThe two chief racing formats used in dirt speedway karting are heat races and timed laps qualification:\n\n*The [[International Kart Federation]] (IKF) runs a racing format of two 10 lap heats followed by a 20 lap final. Finishing positions in the two heat races are used to calculate the starting position in the feature race.\n*The [[World Karting Association]] (WKA) uses time qualifying. Karts equipped with transponders are sent out onto the track in groups of 5 or less to try to achieve the fastest lap time. Positions for the 20 laps feature event are determined by qualifying time.\n*The American Kart Racing Association (AKRA)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akrainc.com |title=American Kart Racing Association (AKRA) |publisher=Akrainc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> uses group transponder qualifying to calculate starting positions for 20-lap features.\n\n=== Racing categories ===\nThere are many different classes in kart. One of the fastest growing in the US is Lo206. The general classes are 125cc Shifter, 100cc tag, 125cc tag and then the rotax equivalents of these karts.\n\n==== International ====\n\n[[File:Ben Willshire GP1.jpg|thumb|[[Superkart]]]]\nThe [[Commission Internationale de Karting|CIK-FIA]] sanctions international championships in [[OK (karting)|OK]], [[OKJ (karting)|OKJ]], [[KZ1 (karting)|KZ1]], [[KZ2]] and [[Superkart]]. These are regarded as the top level classes of karting and are also raced in national championships worldwide. The [[Karting World Championship|World Championship]] is decided here.\nRecently we had the international under 15s  championship. The Dilbert who finished first overall was Vlad Sputzki (Russia) followed by Daniel Smith (England) and in third Maximilien Blank (Australia).\nCIK-FIA categories:\n*OK (the top level) and OKJ for a younger age group. All are using the same water-cooled no-gearbox 125 cc \"long life\" two-stroke engines which are direct drive, each with different technical specifications (mufflers, air boxes, carburetor, rev limit etc.).\n*KZ1 and KZ2, both 125 cc gearbox categories.\n*Superkart, a 250 cc gearbox category.\n\nNon CIK-FIA categories:\nThe Kart World Championship (or KWC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kartworldchampionship.com|title=Kart World Championship}}</ref> as opposed to the FIA's 'Kart'''ing''' World Championship' uses 4-stroke rental karts and travels to a different country each year.\n\n==== National ====\nIn the UK, the most celebrated karting series is the National karting series, also known as [[Super 1 National Kart Championships|Super One]]. There are three types of [[Super 1 National Kart Championships|Super One]] championships:\n\n*MSA series: [[KF2]], [[KF3]], Formula KGP, Super Cadet, Cadet & Bambino\n*[[Rotax Max|Rotax]] series: Minimax, Junior Max, Senior Max, Senior Max 177\n*[[TKM (Karting)|TKM]] series: Formula Junior TKM, Formula TKM Extreme, TKM Senior 4-stroke and since 2006, Honda Cadet\n\nOther UK National Championships include:\n[[Birel]] BirelART series UK: Cadet 60cc, Junior 100cc, Senior Light 125cc, Senior Heavy 125cc\n\nThe BRKC is the UK's rental karting National championship, and the UK's official feeder series to the rental Kart World Championship.\n\n[[Natska|NatSKA]] is a budget karting association set up for schools and youth groups in the UK, with 13 classes.\n\nIn the United States, Dirt oval classes{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} (which often use [[Briggs & Stratton]] industrial engines) are prominent in the Southeast and Midwest.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In the West, European style sprint racing is much more common.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In particular, 125cc shifter karts using Honda CR125 power units have gained tremendous popularity in recent years.<ref>http://www.superkartsusa.com</ref>\n\nIn Australia, classes include Cadet (previously called Midget), Rookie, Junior National Pro, Junior National, Junior Clubman, Junior Rotax (Jmax), KF3, Senior National, Senior Rotax, Senior Clubman, Senior TAG (Restricted and Unrestricted). Most classes run a light and heavy category (with some running super heavy).\n\nMany people race worldwide in [[Spec series]] such as [[Rotax Max]] (a [[Touch-and-go (karting)|TaG]] class) or those using the [[KT100|Yamaha KT100]] engine.\n\n=== Racing licences ===\nAs in other disciplines in motorsports, a license is required to drive a racing kart on a circuit or enter competitions.<ref>[http://gomotorsportracing.com/go-kart-basics/ Go Kart Basics] - Go Motorsport Racing, 14 April 2014</ref> The licenses, issued by governing bodies, are provided by clubs or associations. Most of the time, but not always, a basic insurance coverage is included in the licence annual fee. In some countries, such as [[France]], regulations require the drivers to pass a medical exam each year.\n\nLicense classes differ between countries according to age groups or levels. Most of the time a Practice License can be easily obtained, while a Racing License might require a capability assessment.<ref>[http://www.msauk.org/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=765 Karting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518121012/http://www.msauk.org/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=765 |date=18 May 2014 }} - British [[Motor Sports Association]] (MSA)</ref>\n\n=== Driver equipment ===\nFor their safety, kart drivers are required to wear proper equipment:<ref>[http://www.cikfia.com/web/karting/webkarting.nsf/C54F7EAD9380CB63C125707500537686/$FILE/Web_RT2009.pdf 2009 CIK-FIA Karting Technical Regulations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306070039/http://www.cikfia.com/web/karting/webkarting.nsf/C54F7EAD9380CB63C125707500537686/$FILE/Web_RT2009.pdf |date=6 March 2009 }} \u2013 Article 3 : Kart and Equipment Safety</ref>\n* Full-face [[helmet]] ([[Snell Memorial Foundation|Snell]] SA2005 or K2005 certification is required for racing, K2005 is same as SA2005 without fire resistance)\n* Racing Balaclava\n* Driving suit (abrasion resistant overalls with at least one [[Cordura]] external layer, CIK-FIA Level 2 homologation for top level racing)\n* Gloves\n* Driving boots (ankles must be covered)\n\nRib protector and neck brace, although highly recommended, are optional in most countries.

They are usually raced on [[kart circuit|scaled-down circuits]], although some professional kart racing are also raced in full-size motorsport circuits. Karting is commonly perceived as the stepping stone to the higher ranks of motorsports, with former [[Formula One]] champions such as [[Sebastian Vettel]], [[Nico Rosberg]], [[Ayrton Senna]], [[Lewis Hamilton]], [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Fernando Alonso]] having begun their careers in karting.\n\nKarts vary widely in speed and some (known as [[superkart]]s) can reach speeds exceeding {{convert|260|km/h|mph}}, while recreational go-karts intended for the general public may be limited to lower speeds.\n\n[[File:Fina mundial.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Rotax World Final kart racing]]\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Photography by Victor Albert Grigas (1919-2017)00025 sept 62 (37295972680).jpg|thumb|right|Kart racing in [[Illinois]] in 1962]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B1007-0016-001, 5.

Its first engine, the McCulloch MC-10,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macbobaust.com/kart_engines.html |title=The McCulloch Kart Engines |publisher=Macbobaust.com |date=2002-09-15 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> was an adapted [[chainsaw]] [[two-stroke engine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagekarts.com/mcstory.htm |title=1959 \u2013 McCulloch's Entry into Kart Racing |publisher=Vintagekarts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> Later, in the 1960s, [[motorcycle]] engines were also adapted for kart use, before dedicated manufacturers, especially in Italy ([[Italian American Motor Engineering|IAME]]), started to build engines for the sport.\n\n== Components ==\n\n=== Chassis ===\nThe [[chassis]] are made of chrome moly tubing.<ref>[http://www.haase.it/download/Haase26-CH-11.pdf Example of a CIK-FIA homologation form] \u2013 Chassis, 2005</ref><ref name=\"chassis\">[http://www.cometkartsales.com/store/chassis/cpa/images/margayparts/margay17top.jpg Technical picture of a racing chassis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411105033/http://www.cometkartsales.com/store/chassis/cpa/images/margayparts/margay17top.jpg |date=11 April 2008 }} \u2013 [[Margay Products Inc.|Margay]] chassis</ref> There is no [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] so chassis have to be flexible enough to work as a suspension and stiff enough not to break or give way on a turn. Kart chassis are classified in the United States as 'Open', 'Caged', 'Straight' or 'Offset'. All [[Commission Internationale de Karting]] - [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] or CIK-FIA approved chassis are 'Straight' and 'Open'.\n\n*Open karts have no roll cage.\n*Caged karts have a [[roll cage]] surrounding the driver; they are mostly used on dirt tracks.\n*In Straight chassis the driver sits in the center. Straight chassis are used for [[Kart racing#Sprint|sprint racing]].\n*In Offset chassis the driver sits on the left side. Offset chassis are used for left-turn-only [[Oval track|speedway]] racing.\n\nThe stiffness of the chassis enables different handling characteristics for different circumstances. Typically, for dry conditions a stiffer chassis is preferable, while in wet or other poor traction conditions, a more flexible chassis may work better. Temperature of the track can also affect handling and may prompt additional chassis adjustments. The best chassis allow for stiffening bars at the rear, front and side to be added or removed according to race conditions.<ref>https://www.kartpartsdepot.com/product_p/007.htm</ref>\n\nBraking is achieved by a [[disc brake]] mounted on the rear axle. Front disc brakes are used in most shifter kart classes and are increasingly popular in other classes; however, certain classes do not allow them. Shifter karts have dual master cylinders, one for the front and one for the rear and are adjustable to allow for front/rear bias changes.\n\nProfessionally raced karts typically weigh {{convert|165|to|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, complete without driver. [[Avanti Kart|Avanti]], [[Tony Kart]], [[Jarno Trulli|Trulli]], [[Birel]], [[CRG (kart manufacturer)|CRG]], [[Gillard (kart manufacturer)|Gillard]], [[Intrepid Kart|Intrepid]], [[Kosmic Kart|Kosmic]], [[Alex Zanardi|Zanardi]] or [[Fernando Alonso|FA Kart]] and [[EKS Motorsport|EKS]] are a few well known examples of the many European manufacturers of race-quality chassis. Emmick, Coyote, Bandit, Shadow, MGM, Titan, PRC and [[Margay Products Inc.|Margay]] are American companies producing kart chassis.\n\n=== Engines ===\n[[File:Shifter_Kart_Engine.jpg|thumb|Shifter kart engine]]\nAmusement park [[go-kart]]s can be powered by four-stroke [[Internal combustion engine|engines]] or [[electric motor]]s, while racing karts use small two-stroke or four-stroke engines.\n\n* [[Four-stroke engine]]s can be standard air-cooled industrial based engines, sometimes with small modifications, developing from about 5 to 20&nbsp;hp. [[Briggs & Stratton]], Tecumseh, Kohler, Robin, and [[Honda]] are manufacturers of such engines. They are adequate for racing and fun kart applications. There are also more powerful four-stroke engines available from manufacturers like [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]], TKM, [[Swissauto]] or Aixro ([[Wankel engine]]) offering from 15&nbsp;hp up to 48&nbsp;hp. They run to and around 11,000 rpm, and are manufactured specifically for karting. Those are used in some National Championship classes like the two-strokes.\n* [[Two-stroke engine|Two-stroke]] kart engines are developed and built by dedicated manufacturers. WTP, Comer, [[Italian American Motor Engineering|IAME]] (Parilla, Komet, Woltjer), TM, Vortex, Titan, REFO, Modena Engines, TKM, [[PRD Fireball|PRD]], [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] and [[Rotax]] are manufacturers of such engines. These can develop from about 8&nbsp;hp for a single-cylinder 60 cc unit (MiniROK by Vortex) to over 90&nbsp;hp for a twin 250 cc.<<ref name=\"Superkart\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parcferme.com/content/view/2663/2/ |title=Superkart at Magny-Cours \u2013 2007 |publisher=Parcferme.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> Today, the most popular categories worldwide are those using the TaG 125 cc units.

This is achieved by designing the chassis so that the inside rear tire lifts up slightly when the kart turns the corner. This allows the tire to lose some of its grip and slide or lift off the ground completely.\n\nPower is transmitted from the engine to the rear axle by a chain. Both engine and axle [[sprockets]] are removable. Their ratio must be adapted to the track configuration to obtain the most from the engine.\n\nIn the early days, karts were direct drive (requiring push starts). The inconvenience of that configuration led to the [[centrifugal clutch]] for the club level classes. Dry centrifugal clutches are now used in many categories ([[Rotax Max]] is one example) and have become the norm as the top international classes have switched to 125&nbsp;cc clutched engines as of January 2007.\n\n=== Tires ===\nWheels and [[tire]]s are much smaller than those used on a normal car. Rims are made of [[magnesium]] alloy, [[aluminum]], or [[composite material]]s. Tires can support cornering forces in excess of 2 [[Gravity of Earth|g]] (20&nbsp;m/s\u00b2), depending on chassis, engine, and motor [[Racing setup|setup]]. Some car tire manufacturers, such as [[Bridgestone]], [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]], and [[Maxxis]] make tires for karts. There are also specific kart tire manufacturers, which include MG, MOJO, Vega, Hoosier and Burris.\n\nSimilar to other motorsports, kart tires have different types for use appropriate to track conditions:\n* [[Slick tire|Slicks]], for dry track. Slick kart tires come in many different compounds, from very soft (maximum grip) to very hard (amusement and rental karts, less grip but long life span). In international level racing, because the drivers are free to choose their tires<ref>[http://www.cikfiachampionship.com/news.asp?id=77 Latest decisions of the FIA World Motor Sport Council concerning Karting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926005547/http://www.cikfiachampionship.com/news.asp?id=77 |date=26 September 2014 }} - CIK-FIA, 15 March 2012</ref> and because of the short duration of each round (10 to 20 minutes  maximum), these are some of the softest tires found in motorsport.\n* [[Rain tire]]s, or \"wets\", for wet weather. They are grooved, made of soft compound, and are narrower than slicks. Not all racing classes allow rain tires.\n* Special, such as spiked tires for icy conditions, or \"cuts/grooved\" for high grip dirt/clay speedways. Cuts are slicks modified with a [[lathe]] to optimize handling. Tire manufacturers such as Hoosier and Burris also make a slightly larger grooved tire only used in dirt track racing.\n\n=== Data acquisition ===\n\nAs in other motor sports, several data acquisition systems have been developed for kart racing. These systems allow the driver to monitor from a display fixed on the steering wheel some parameters such as RPM, timing of laps (including sectors), number of laps, best lap, cooling system temperature, exhaust gas temperature and sometimes speed or even gear for shifter karts.\n\nSome of those systems are able to record (logging) laps data from the sensors, allowing replay of an entire running session or/and direct download to a personal computer equipped with a data analysis software. More sophisticated systems allow for more information such as lateral and longitudinal acceleration ([[g-force]]), throttle position, steering wheel position and brake pressure.\n\n== Racing ==\n[[File:KartingNSKC.jpg|thumb|Sprint race at Eastern Creek, Australia]]\n[[File:Rotax Max1.jpg|thumb|Maximilien Blank and his team-mate Jason Trulo (sprint)]]\nKart racing is generally accepted as the most economic form of [[motorsport]] available on four wheels. As a free-time activity, it can be performed by almost anybody, and as a motorsport in itself, it is one of the sports regulated by [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] (under the name of [[Commission Internationale de Karting|CIK]]), permitting licensed racing for anyone from the age of 8 onward.\n\nIn the United States, there is not as much FIA involvement; instead, many organizations regulate racing, such as the IKF ([[International Kart Federation]]), WKA ([[World Karting Association]]), KART (Karters of America Racing Triad), USPKS (United States Pro Karting Series).\n\nIn the UK, the [[Motor Sports Association]] (MSA) regulates most 'owner driver' Karting. Some associations, such as [[Natska|NatSKA]] (National Schools Karting Association), organize race meetings throughout the country under the authority of the MSA.\nVarious four-stroke 'hire kart' series such as EPEC (European Prokart Endurance Championship)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teessidekarting.co.uk/European-pro-kart.php |title=European Endurance Prokart Championship (EPEC) |publisher=Teessidekarting.co.uk |accessdate=2011-08-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908011101/http://www.teessidekarting.co.uk/European-pro-kart.php |archivedate=8 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> or BRKC (British Rental Kart Championship)<ref>{{cite web |author=Bradley Philpot |url=http://www.brkc.net |title=British Rental Kart Championship |publisher=BRKC |accessdate=2011-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224094952/http://brkc.net/ |archive-date=24 December 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> fall outside the governance of the MSA. Billed as the UK's first national karting ''league,'' the Elite Karting League also falls outside of MSA governance.\n\nIn Australia, kart racing is administered by the [[Australian Karting Association]] on the behalf of FIA and [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]]. There is a manual released every year detailing the various rules and regulations that race meetings and drivers have to follow.\n\nRacing classes start at age 7 or 8 (5 in the US with \"Kid Karts\") and generally run in 3-year age groupings or weight divisions until \"senior\" status is reached at age 15 or 16, depending on the series.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n=== Racing formats ===\nTypically, race formats are one of the following:\n\n==== Sprint ====\nSprint racing takes place on dedicated kart circuits resembling small road courses, with left and right turns. Tracks range from 1/4 mile (400 metres) to over 1 mile (1,600 metres) in length.\n\nThe sprint format is a series of short-duration races, normally for a small number of laps, that qualify for a final, with a variety of point scoring calculations to determine the event's overall winner. Typical duration does not normally exceed 15 minutes. Here, speed and successful passing is of the most importance. It normally occurs in the format of three qualifying heats and a final race for trophy positions.\n\nThe [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] championships, including the [[Karting World Championship]], take place in this format.\n\n==== Endurance ====\n[[File:enduros.jpg|thumb|Pack of laydown enduros at [[Daytona International Speedway]]]]\nEndurance races last for an extended period, ranging from 30 minutes up to 24 hours or more, for one or more drivers. In general, consistency, reliability, and pit strategy is of greater importance than all out speed.\n\nCalled \"enduro\" racing in the United States, most [[World Karting Association|WKA]] and [[International Kart Federation|IKF]] sanctioned events typically last 30 minutes (sprint enduro) or 45 minutes (laydown enduro) and are run continuously without pit stops. Enduro events are held on full-size road racing circuits that are usually between 1.5 and 4 miles in length.\n\nAs well as the famous [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race for automobiles there is also a 24-hours event for karts which takes place at the kart circuit Alain Prost at [[Le Mans]], France.<ref> [http://www.circuitalainprost.com Kart circuit Alain Prost \u2013 24 hours] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106063535/http://www.circuitalainprost.com/ |date=6 January 2008 }}</ref> This race has taken place since 1986 and its winners list include four-time [[Champ Car]] champion  [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]] (in 1996).\n\nEndurance racing is also considered a more affordable way of getting into karting. In South Africa, the 24 Hours of Karting Festival race is held annually and lasts 24 hours with multiple classes participating. This event is hosted by the Prokart SSS Club <ref>[http://www.prokartsss.co.za Prokart SSS]</ref> near Johannesburg. The most popular class runs the Honda GX390 four-stroke engine, which is both affordable and durable, keeping running costs to a minimum. The Prokart Super Single Series, also known as Prokart SSS, has been running for more than 20 years and has proven to be a very popular entry platform for drivers of all ages who want to get into karting. Many clubs worldwide have taken on four-stroke endurance karting for this reason, since two-stroke karting can be very expensive.\n\n==== Speedway ====\nSpeedway racing takes place on [[asphalt]] or clay [[oval (geometry)|oval]] tracks which are normally between 1/10 mile and 1/4 mile long. Tracks primarily consist of two straights and four left-turn corners, few tracks are symmetric and often the shape parallels that of an egg or a [[tri-oval]].\n\n'Offset' kart chassis have been developed for precise handling and adjustability in left-turn-only racing competition taking place on oval and tri-oval tracks. Depending on the track material, different tires are used on the kart. <ref>https://www.kartpartsdepot.com/Introduction_to_Go_Kart_Tires_p/81.htm</ref> \n\nSpeedway kart races range in length from 4 laps for a trophy dash, to 20 laps for a main event.\n\nThe two chief racing formats used in dirt speedway karting are heat races and timed laps qualification:\n\n*The [[International Kart Federation]] (IKF) runs a racing format of two 10 lap heats followed by a 20 lap final. Finishing positions in the two heat races are used to calculate the starting position in the feature race.\n*The [[World Karting Association]] (WKA) uses time qualifying. Karts equipped with transponders are sent out onto the track in groups of 5 or less to try to achieve the fastest lap time. Positions for the 20 laps feature event are determined by qualifying time.\n*The American Kart Racing Association (AKRA)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akrainc.com |title=American Kart Racing Association (AKRA) |publisher=Akrainc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref> uses group transponder qualifying to calculate starting positions for 20-lap features.\n\n=== Racing categories ===\nThere are many different classes in kart. One of the fastest growing in the US is Lo206. The general classes are 125cc Shifter, 100cc tag, 125cc tag and then the rotax equivalents of these karts.\n\n==== International ====\n\n[[File:Ben Willshire GP1.jpg|thumb|[[Superkart]]]]\nThe [[Commission Internationale de Karting|CIK-FIA]] sanctions international championships in [[OK (karting)|OK]], [[OKJ (karting)|OKJ]], [[KZ1 (karting)|KZ1]], [[KZ2]] and [[Superkart]]. These are regarded as the top level classes of karting and are also raced in national championships worldwide. The [[Karting World Championship|World Championship]] is decided here.\nRecently we had the international under 15s  championship. The Dilbert who finished first overall was Vlad Sputzki (Russia) followed by Daniel Smith (England) and in third Maximilien Blank (Australia).\nCIK-FIA categories:\n*OK (the top level) and OKJ for a younger age group. All are using the same water-cooled no-gearbox 125 cc \"long life\" two-stroke engines which are direct drive, each with different technical specifications (mufflers, air boxes, carburetor, rev limit etc.).\n*KZ1 and KZ2, both 125 cc gearbox categories.\n*Superkart, a 250 cc gearbox category.\n\nNon CIK-FIA categories:\nThe Kart World Championship (or KWC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kartworldchampionship.com|title=Kart World Championship}}</ref> as opposed to the FIA's 'Kart'''ing''' World Championship' uses 4-stroke rental karts and travels to a different country each year.\n\n==== National ====\nIn the UK, the most celebrated karting series is the National karting series, also known as [[Super 1 National Kart Championships|Super One]]. There are three types of [[Super 1 National Kart Championships|Super One]] championships:\n\n*MSA series: [[KF2]], [[KF3]], Formula KGP, Super Cadet, Cadet & Bambino\n*[[Rotax Max|Rotax]] series: Minimax, Junior Max, Senior Max, Senior Max 177\n*[[TKM (Karting)|TKM]] series: Formula Junior TKM, Formula TKM Extreme, TKM Senior 4-stroke and since 2006, Honda Cadet\n\nOther UK National Championships include:\n[[Birel]] BirelART series UK: Cadet 60cc, Junior 100cc, Senior Light 125cc, Senior Heavy 125cc\n\nThe BRKC is the UK's rental karting National championship, and the UK's official feeder series to the rental Kart World Championship.\n\n[[Natska|NatSKA]] is a budget karting association set up for schools and youth groups in the UK, with 13 classes.\n\nIn the United States, Dirt oval classes{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} (which often use [[Briggs & Stratton]] industrial engines) are prominent in the Southeast and Midwest.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In the West, European style sprint racing is much more common.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In particular, 125cc shifter karts using Honda CR125 power units have gained tremendous popularity in recent years.<ref>http://www.superkartsusa.com</ref>\n\nIn Australia, classes include Cadet (previously called Midget), Rookie, Junior National Pro, Junior National, Junior Clubman, Junior Rotax (Jmax), KF3, Senior National, Senior Rotax, Senior Clubman, Senior TAG (Restricted and Unrestricted). Most classes run a light and heavy category (with some running super heavy).\n\nMany people race worldwide in [[Spec series]] such as [[Rotax Max]] (a [[Touch-and-go (karting)|TaG]] class) or those using the [[KT100|Yamaha KT100]] engine.\n\n=== Racing licences ===\nAs in other disciplines in motorsports, a license is required to drive a racing kart on a circuit or enter competitions.<ref>[http://gomotorsportracing.com/go-kart-basics/ Go Kart Basics] - Go Motorsport Racing, 14 April 2014</ref> The licenses, issued by governing bodies, are provided by clubs or associations. Most of the time, but not always, a basic insurance coverage is included in the licence annual fee. In some countries, such as [[France]], regulations require the drivers to pass a medical exam each year.\n\nLicense classes differ between countries according to age groups or levels. Most of the time a Practice License can be easily obtained, while a Racing License might require a capability assessment.<ref>[http://www.msauk.org/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=765 Karting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518121012/http://www.msauk.org/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=765 |date=18 May 2014 }} - British [[Motor Sports Association]] (MSA)</ref>\n\n=== Driver equipment ===\nFor their safety, kart drivers are required to wear proper equipment:<ref>[http://www.cikfia.com/web/karting/webkarting.nsf/C54F7EAD9380CB63C125707500537686/$FILE/Web_RT2009.pdf 2009 CIK-FIA Karting Technical Regulations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306070039/http://www.cikfia.com/web/karting/webkarting.nsf/C54F7EAD9380CB63C125707500537686/$FILE/Web_RT2009.pdf |date=6 March 2009 }} \u2013 Article 3 : Kart and Equipment Safety</ref>\n* Full-face [[helmet]] ([[Snell Memorial Foundation|Snell]] SA2005 or K2005 certification is required for racing, K2005 is same as SA2005 without fire resistance)\n* Racing Balaclava\n* Driving suit (abrasion resistant overalls with at least one [[Cordura]] external layer, CIK-FIA Level 2 homologation for top level racing)\n* Gloves\n* Driving boots (ankles must be covered)\n\nRib protector and neck brace, although highly recommended, are optional in most countries. None of the above need to be made of fire retardant material. Superkart drivers are required to wear leather overalls, similar to those used in [[Motorcycle safety clothing|motorcycling]].\n\n== As a learning tool ==\nKart racing is usually used as a low-cost and relatively safe way to introduce drivers to motor racing. Drivers can start at the age of 6 in the Motorsport UK Bambino Championship <ref>KartingForum.co.uk [https://www.kartingforum.co.uk/threads/find-out-more-about-bambino.100 \"UK Bambino Championship - Cost effective starter class for 6-8 year olds!\"], ''[[KartingForum.co.uk]]'', Essex, 16 December 2019.

Arriving in [[Port Albert]], Victoria, in 1841 with his clan, they apparently drove their Highland cattle to a farm at Greenmount, on the [[Tarra River (Victoria)|Tarra River]], preceded by a piper. [[Samuel Amess]], also from Scotland, who made a fortune in the Victorian goldfields and became Mayor of Melbourne in 1869, kept a small fold of black Highland cattle on [[Churchill Island]]. They were seen and survived in [[Port Victoria, South Australia|Port Victoria]] during the late 1800s, but other folds were believed to have died out in areas such as [[New South Wales]]. In 1988 the Australian Highland Cattle Society was formed.

Young bulls will dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother.

Respiratory therapists graduate from a college or university \nwith a certification in respiratory therapy and have passed a national board certifying examination.  The NBRC (National Board for Respiratory Care) is the not-for-profit organization responsible for credentionaling the seven areas of Respiratory Therapy in the United States. \n\nThose seven areas of Respiratory Therapy include, as of December 2017: CRT (Certified Respiratory Therapist), RRT (Registered Respiratory Therapist), CPFT and RPFT (Certified or Registered Pulmonary Function Technologist), ACCS (Adult Critical Care Specialist), NPS (Neonatal/Pediatric Specialist), and SDS (Sleep Disorder Specialist).\n\nRespiratory therapists work in hospitals in the intensive care units (Adult, Pediatric, and Neonatal), on hospital floors, in Emergency Departments, in Pulmonay Functioning laboratories (PFTs), are able to intubate patients, work in sleep labs (polysomnograpy) (PSG) labs, and in home care specifically DME (Durable Medical Equipment) and home oxygen.\n\nRespiratory therapists are specialists and educators in many areas including [[cardiology]], [[pulmonology]], and sleep therapy.  Respiratory therapists are clinicians trained in advanced [[airway management]]; establishing and maintaining the airway during management of trauma, and intensive care.\n\nRespiratory therapists initiate and manage [[life support]] for people in intensive care units and emergency departments, stabilizing, treating and managing pre-hospital and hospital-to-hospital patient transport by air or ground ambulance.\n\nIn the outpatient setting respiratory therapists work as educators in asthma clinics, ancillary clinical staff in pediatric clinics, and sleep-disorder diagnosticians in sleep-clinics, they also serve as clinical providers in cardiology clinics and cath-labs, as well as working in pulmonary rehabilitation.\n\n== Clinical practice ==\n[[File:Respiratory therapist.jpg|thumb|Respiratory Therapist in an intensive care unit]]\n;Intensive care and operating room\nRespiratory therapists educate, assist in diagnosis, and treat people who are suffering from heart and lung problems.  Specialized in both cardiac and pulmonary care, Respiratory Therapists often collaborate with specialists in [[pulmonology]] and [[anaesthesia]] in various aspects of clinical care of patients. Respiratory therapists provide a vital role in both [[medicine]] and [[nursing]]. A vital role in ICU is the initiation and maintenance of mechanical ventilation and the care of artificial airways.\n\n;Outpatient clinical practice\nRespiratory therapists are also primary clinicians in conducting tests to measure lung function and teaching people to manage [[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder]] among other cardiac and lung functions.\n\nInternationally, Respiratory Therapists that provide lung function testing are termed respiratory scientists, but in North America, they may be a Respiratory Therapist or may also be a certified pulmonary function technician in the United States.\n\n;Home-health care\nOutside of clinics and hospitals, Respiratory Therapists often manage home oxygen needs of patients and their families, providing around the clock support for home ventilators and other equipment for conditions like [[sleep apnea]].\n\nIn the clinic or outpatient setting Respiratory Therapists assist with diagnosis and serve as an educator for patients suffering from cardiac and respiratory illness.<ref>{{cite news |title=PCC Notes: Respiratory students train |url=http://www.reflector.com/news/pcc-notes-respiratory-students-train-759223 |newspaper=The Reflector |accessdate=6 November 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805102852/http://www.reflector.com/news/pcc-notes-respiratory-students-train-759223 |archivedate=5 August 2016 }}</ref>   In the [[United States]], Respiratory Therapists with certification as [[Registered Respiratory Therapist]]s evaluate and treat patients with a great deal of autonomy under the direction of a [[pulmonologist]].<ref name=\"pmid19558737\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Harbrecht BG, Delgado E, Tuttle RP, Cohen-Melamed MH, Saul MI, Valenta CA | title=Improved outcomes with routine Respiratory Therapist evaluation of non-intensive-care-unit surgery patients.  | journal=[[Respiratory Care (journal)|Respiratory Care]] | year= 2009 | volume= 54 | issue= 7 | pages= 861\u20137 | pmid=19558737 | doi= 10.4187/002013209793800457| pmc= | url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3068929a838136428e20baa0105bfb7d14584b69}}</ref>  In facilities that maintain critical care transport teams Respiratory Therapists are a preferred addition to all types of [[Ambulance|surface]] or [[Air medical services|air transport]].<ref name=\"pmid10130326\">{{cite journal|vauthors=O'Malley RJ, Rhee KJ | title=Contribution of air medical personnel to the airway management of injured patients.  | journal=Air Med J | year= 1993 | volume= 12 | issue= 11\u201312 | pages= 425\u20138 | pmid=10130326 | doi=10.1016/S1067-991X(05)80138-5 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=10130326  }}</ref>\n\n;Public education \nIn other settings Respiratory Therapists are found in schools as asthma educators, working with teachers and coaches about childhood symptoms of asthma and how to spot an emergency.

In many countries this recognition is in a transition stage; as an example, in 2011, hospitals in [[Beijing, China]] began a recruitment drive to acquire Respiratory Therapists for their intensive care units where previously nurses were the only clinician.<ref name=\"pmid22005194\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Zhan QY, Liang ZA, Tu ML, Sun B, Yao XL, etal | title=Respiratory Care Practices and Requirement for Respiratory Therapists in Beijing ICUs.  | journal=[[Respiratory Care (journal)|Respiratory Care]] | year= 2011 | volume=  57| issue=  3| pages=  370\u20136| pmid=22005194 | doi=10.4187/respcare.01093 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=22005194  }}</ref>\n\n=== Canada ===\nUpon graduation from an accredited school of respiratory therapy, the graduate is then eligible to write the national exam administered by the [[Canadian Board for Respiratory Care]].\n\nSuccess on this examination will then allow the Respiratory Therapist to register with any licensing body in Canada.  Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan are the Canadian provinces with provincial licensing bodies; in these provinces, it is illegal to practice the profession of Respiratory Care without first being licensed as a full or provisional member with the provincial licensing body.\n\nThese provinces are so-called regulated provinces.  In some provinces, one may work provisionally upon graduating, until writing and passing the exam. In all other jurisdictions, the licensing body for the profession of Respiratory Care is the [[Canadian Society for Respiratory Therapy]].\n\nRegistration as a full member is optional for Respiratory Therapists living in regulated provinces, however, for Respiratory Therapists living in non-regulated provinces, registration as a full member with the CSRT is compulsory.  Registration with the provincial regulatory body or the CSRT (in non-regulated provinces) confers upon the Respiratory Therapist the title of Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT). Canada and the United States recognize each their cardio-pulmonary education structure as equal, however a qualifying exam must be written in order to practice in either nation.\n\nThere is pressure for the program to become a degree, as other therapies ([[Physical Therapy]], [[Occupational Therapy]]) now require a master's degree or greater.  However, in some places such as [[Alberta]], Canada the cardio-pulmonary course work are only offered at technical schools which are unable to grant a formal degree.\n\n=== France ===\nRespiratory therapy is a sub-specialty of [[physical therapy]] in France.<ref>World Confederation for Physical Therapy.

Following qualification and a period of rotations throughout the core areas of Physiotherapy practice, they may then follow a career pathway specialising in Respiratory Physiotherapy.  Areas of practice include Critical Care, respiratory medicine, Cystic Fibrosis, Asthma, Hyperventilation Syndrome, general and specialised surgery, non-invasive ventilation, ventilation weaning, cardiac and pulmonary rehab, respiratory therapy outpatient clinics and community respiratory therapy.

Respiratory therapists graduate from a college or university \nwith a certification in respiratory therapy and have passed a national board certifying examination.  The NBRC (National Board for Respiratory Care) is the not-for-profit organization responsible for credentionaling the seven areas of Respiratory Therapy in the United States. \n\nThose seven areas of Respiratory Therapy include, as of December 2017: CRT (Certified Respiratory Therapist), RRT (Registered Respiratory Therapist), CPFT and RPFT (Certified or Registered Pulmonary Function Technologist), ACCS (Adult Critical Care Specialist), NPS (Neonatal/Pediatric Specialist), and SDS (Sleep Disorder Specialist).\n\nRespiratory therapists work in hospitals in the intensive care units (Adult, Pediatric, and Neonatal), on hospital floors, in Emergency Departments, in Pulmonay Functioning laboratories (PFTs), are able to intubate patients, work in sleep labs (polysomnograpy) (PSG) labs, and in home care specifically DME (Durable Medical Equipment) and home oxygen.\n\nRespiratory therapists are specialists and educators in many areas including [[cardiology]], [[pulmonology]], and sleep therapy.  Respiratory therapists are clinicians trained in advanced [[airway management]]; establishing and maintaining the airway during management of trauma, and intensive care.\n\nRespiratory therapists initiate and manage [[life support]] for people in intensive care units and emergency departments, stabilizing, treating and managing pre-hospital and hospital-to-hospital patient transport by air or ground ambulance.\n\nIn the outpatient setting respiratory therapists work as educators in asthma clinics, ancillary clinical staff in pediatric clinics, and sleep-disorder diagnosticians in sleep-clinics, they also serve as clinical providers in cardiology clinics and cath-labs, as well as working in pulmonary rehabilitation.\n\n== Clinical practice ==\n[[File:Respiratory therapist.jpg|thumb|Respiratory Therapist in an intensive care unit]]\n;Intensive care and operating room\nRespiratory therapists educate, assist in diagnosis, and treat people who are suffering from heart and lung problems.  Specialized in both cardiac and pulmonary care, Respiratory Therapists often collaborate with specialists in [[pulmonology]] and [[anaesthesia]] in various aspects of clinical care of patients. Respiratory therapists provide a vital role in both [[medicine]] and [[nursing]]. A vital role in ICU is the initiation and maintenance of mechanical ventilation and the care of artificial airways.\n\n;Outpatient clinical practice\nRespiratory therapists are also primary clinicians in conducting tests to measure lung function and teaching people to manage [[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder]] among other cardiac and lung functions.\n\nInternationally, Respiratory Therapists that provide lung function testing are termed respiratory scientists, but in North America, they may be a Respiratory Therapist or may also be a certified pulmonary function technician in the United States.\n\n;Home-health care\nOutside of clinics and hospitals, Respiratory Therapists often manage home oxygen needs of patients and their families, providing around the clock support for home ventilators and other equipment for conditions like [[sleep apnea]].\n\nIn the clinic or outpatient setting Respiratory Therapists assist with diagnosis and serve as an educator for patients suffering from cardiac and respiratory illness.<ref>{{cite news |title=PCC Notes: Respiratory students train |url=http://www.reflector.com/news/pcc-notes-respiratory-students-train-759223 |newspaper=The Reflector |accessdate=6 November 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805102852/http://www.reflector.com/news/pcc-notes-respiratory-students-train-759223 |archivedate=5 August 2016 }}</ref>   In the [[United States]], Respiratory Therapists with certification as [[Registered Respiratory Therapist]]s evaluate and treat patients with a great deal of autonomy under the direction of a [[pulmonologist]].<ref name=\"pmid19558737\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Harbrecht BG, Delgado E, Tuttle RP, Cohen-Melamed MH, Saul MI, Valenta CA | title=Improved outcomes with routine Respiratory Therapist evaluation of non-intensive-care-unit surgery patients.  | journal=[[Respiratory Care (journal)|Respiratory Care]] | year= 2009 | volume= 54 | issue= 7 | pages= 861\u20137 | pmid=19558737 | doi= 10.4187/002013209793800457| pmc= | url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3068929a838136428e20baa0105bfb7d14584b69}}</ref>  In facilities that maintain critical care transport teams Respiratory Therapists are a preferred addition to all types of [[Ambulance|surface]] or [[Air medical services|air transport]].<ref name=\"pmid10130326\">{{cite journal|vauthors=O'Malley RJ, Rhee KJ | title=Contribution of air medical personnel to the airway management of injured patients.  | journal=Air Med J | year= 1993 | volume= 12 | issue= 11\u201312 | pages= 425\u20138 | pmid=10130326 | doi=10.1016/S1067-991X(05)80138-5 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=10130326  }}</ref>\n\n;Public education \nIn other settings Respiratory Therapists are found in schools as asthma educators, working with teachers and coaches about childhood symptoms of asthma and how to spot an emergency.

In some provinces, one may work provisionally upon graduating, until writing and passing the exam. In all other jurisdictions, the licensing body for the profession of Respiratory Care is the [[Canadian Society for Respiratory Therapy]].\n\nRegistration as a full member is optional for Respiratory Therapists living in regulated provinces, however, for Respiratory Therapists living in non-regulated provinces, registration as a full member with the CSRT is compulsory.

Canada and the United States recognize each their cardio-pulmonary education structure as equal, however a qualifying exam must be written in order to practice in either nation.\n\nThere is pressure for the program to become a degree, as other therapies ([[Physical Therapy]], [[Occupational Therapy]]) now require a master's degree or greater.

They lent her contract to the British studio [[Hammer Film Productions]], for whom she made ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' (1966). Although she had only three lines of dialogue in the film, images of her in the [[Fur bikini of Raquel Welch|doe-skin bikini]] which she wore became best-selling posters that turned her into an international [[sex symbol]]. She later starred in notable films including ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'' (1967), ''[[Bandolero!]]'' (1968), ''[[100 Rifles]]'' (1969), ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'' (1970) and ''[[Hannie Caulder]]'' (1971). She made several [[television]] [[variety show|variety]] specials.\n\nWelch's unique film persona made her an icon of the 1960s and 1970s, due to her portrayal of strong female characters and breaking the mold of the archetypal sex symbol. Because of this, her rise to stardom in the mid 1960s was partly credited with ending Hollywood's vigorous promotion of the [[blonde bombshell (stereotype)|blonde bombshell]].<ref>Longworth, Karina.

Although she had only three lines of dialogue in the film, images of her in the [[Fur bikini of Raquel Welch|doe-skin bikini]] which she wore became best-selling posters that turned her into an international [[sex symbol]]. She later starred in notable films including ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'' (1967), ''[[Bandolero!]]'' (1968), ''[[100 Rifles]]'' (1969), ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'' (1970) and ''[[Hannie Caulder]]'' (1971). She made several [[television]] [[variety show|variety]] specials.\n\nWelch's unique film persona made her an icon of the 1960s and 1970s, due to her portrayal of strong female characters and breaking the mold of the archetypal sex symbol. Because of this, her rise to stardom in the mid 1960s was partly credited with ending Hollywood's vigorous promotion of the [[blonde bombshell (stereotype)|blonde bombshell]].<ref>Longworth, Karina.
