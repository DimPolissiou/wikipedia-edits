Policies vary by state, with weekly unemployment benefits paying eligible workers up to $783.00 in [[Massachusetts]] and up to $235 in [[Mississippi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aboutunemployment.org/faqs/best-and-worst-states-for-unemployment-benefits/|title=Best and Worst States for Unemployment Benefits \u2013 2017|website=AboutUnemployment.org|language=en-US|access-date=March 5, 2018|date=February 25, 2017}}</ref> Benefits are generally paid by state governments, funded in large part by state and federal payroll taxes levied against employers, to workers who have become unemployed through no fault of their own. Eligibility requirements for unemployment insurance vary by state, but generally speaking, employees not fired for misconduct (\"terminated for cause\") are eligible for unemployment benefits, while those fired for misconduct (this sometimes can include misconduct committed outside the workplace, such as a problematic social media post or committing a crime) are not.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-wrongful-termination-2061658|title=How to Handle a Wrongful Termination|publisher=thebalance.com}}</ref>\n\nIn every state, employees who quit their job without \"good cause\" are not eligible for unemployment benefits, but the definition of good cause varies by state. In some states, being fired for misconduct permanently bars the employee from receiving unemployment benefits, while in others it only disqualifies the employee for a short period. This compensation is classified as a type of social welfare benefit. According to the [[Internal Revenue Code]], these types of benefits are to be included in a taxpayer's gross income.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tax Topics \u2013 Topic 418 Unemployment Compensation |work=Internal Revenue Service |url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc418.html }}</ref>\n\nThe standard time-length of unemployment compensation is six months, although extensions are possible during economic downturns. During the [[Great Recession]], unemployment benefits were extended by 73 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-long-unemployment-benefits-now-last-in-each-state-2014-1|title=Here's How Long Unemployment Benefits Now Last In Each State|work=Business Insider}}</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court held that federal unemployment law is constitutional and does not violate the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] in ''[[Steward Machine Company v. Davis]]'', [[Case citation|301 U.S. 548]] (1937).\n\n==Federal-state joint programs==\n\nUnemployment insurance is a federal-state program financed through federal and state payroll taxes (federal and state UI taxes),<ref name=\"LABOR UNEMPLOY\">{{cite web|url=http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/uitaxtopic.asp|title=Unemployment Insurance Tax Topic, Employment & Training Administration (ETA) \u2013 U.S. Department of Labor|website=workforcesecurity.doleta.gov}}</ref> except for Pandemic Unemployment Insurance aka PUA. <https://labor.ny.gov/ui/pdfs/pandemic-unemployment-assistance.pdf> which is funded by the United States government.<https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hr748enr/pdf/BILLS-116hr748enr.pdf>  In most states employers pay state and federal unemployment taxes if:\n\n:(1) they pay wages to employees totaling $1,500 or more in any quarter of a calendar year; or,<ref name=\"LABOR UNEMPLOY\"/>\n:(2) they had at least one employee during any day of a week during 20 weeks in a calendar year, regardless of whether the weeks were consecutive. Some state laws differ from the federal law.<ref name=\"LABOR UNEMPLOY\"/>\n\nTo facilitate this program, the [[U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act]] (FUTA), which authorizes the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) to collect an annual federal employer tax used to fund state workforce agencies. FUTA covers the costs of administering the Unemployment Insurance and Job Service programs in all states. In addition, FUTA pays one-half of the cost of extended unemployment benefits which are triggered in periods of high state unemployment. FUTA also provides a fund from which states UI funds may borrow to pay benefits. As originally established, the states paid the federal government.<ref name=\"LABOR UNEMPLOY\"/>\n\nUntil June 2011, the FUTA tax rate was 3% of taxable wages collected from employers of at least four employees,<ref name=\"UNEMPLOY 182\">{{cite book|title=''State and Local Government''|last=Zimmerman|first=Joseph F.|publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]]|year=1970|isbn=|location=[[New York, New York]]|pages=182}}</ref> and employers could deduct up to 90% of the amount due if they paid taxes to a state to support a system of unemployment insurance which met Federal standards.<ref name=\"UNEMPLOY 213\">{{cite book |last=Zimmerman |first=Joseph F. |title= ''State and Local Government'' |year= 1970 |publisher= [[Barnes & Noble]] |location=New York, NY |isbn= | pages=213}}</ref> As of June 30, 2011, the FUTA tax rate is 6.0% of taxable wages of employees who meet both the above and following criteria,<ref name=\"LABOR UNEMPLOY\"/> and the taxable wage base is the first $7,000 paid in wages to each employee during a calendar year.<ref name=\"LABOR UNEMPLOY\"/> Employers who pay the state unemployment tax on time receive an offset credit of up to 5.4% regardless of the rate of tax they pay their state. Therefore, the net FUTA tax rate is generally 0.6% (6.0% \u2013 5.4%), for a maximum FUTA tax of $42.00 per employee, per year (.006 X $7,000 = $42.00). State law determines individual state unemployment insurance tax rates.<ref name=\"LABOR UNEMPLOY\"/> In the United States, unemployment insurance tax rates use [[experience rating]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/lavape/9615.html|title=Unemployment Insurance Experience Rating of Firms and Layoffs|first1=P.

The federal government sets broad guidelines for coverage and eligibility, but states vary in how they determine benefits and eligibility.\n\nFederal rules are drawn by the [[United States Department of Labor]], Employment and Training Administration. For most states, the maximum period for receiving benefits is 26 weeks. There is an extended benefit program (authorized through the Social Security Acts) that may be triggered by the state unemployment rate. Congress has often passed temporary programs to extend benefits during recessions. This was done with the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation (TEUC) program in 2002\u20132003, which has since expired,<ref>{{cite news |title= Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation |work=Employment & Training Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |url= http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/factsheetteuc.asp}}</ref> and remained in force through June 2, 2010, with the Extended Unemployment Compensation 2008 legislation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Emergency Unemployment Compensation 2008 (EUC) Program |work=Employment & Training Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |url= http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/euc08.pdf }}</ref> In July 2010, legislation that provides an extension of federal extended unemployment benefits through November 2010 was signed by the president. The legislation extended benefits for 2.3 million unemployed workers who had exhausted their unemployment benefits.\n\nThe federal government lends money to the states for unemployment insurance when states run short of funds which happens when the state's UI fund cannot cover the cost of current benefits. A high unemployment rate shrinks UI tax revenues and increases expenditures on benefits. State UI finances and the need for loans are exacerbated when a state cuts taxes and increases benefits. FUTA loans to state funds are repaid with interest.\n\nCongressional actions to increase penalties for states incurring large debts for unemployment benefits led to state fiscal crises in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nOne interesting feature of the UI tax is that it targets firms that have recently had layoffs, potentially hitting distressed firms. Recent work shows that UI tax increases significantly reduce hiring and employment in affected firms, potentially eroding the macroeconomics stabilizing influence of the UI program.<ref>{{cite news |title=Unemployment Insurance Taxes and Labor Demand: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Administrative Data |work=SSRN Repository |publisher=Working Paper |ssrn=3062412 }}</ref>\n\n==Eligibility and amount==\nIn order to receive benefits, a person must have worked for at least one quarter in the previous year and have been laid-off by an employer. Workers who were temporary or were paid under the table are not eligible for unemployment insurance. If a worker quits without good cause or is fired for misconduct, then they are normally not eligible for UI benefits. There are five common reasons a claim for unemployment benefits are denied: the worker is unavailable for work, the worker quit his or her job without good cause, the worker was fired for misconduct, refusing suitable work, and unemployment resulting from a labor dispute.<ref>{{cite news |title=Unemployed Without Benefits: A Couple's Struggle |first=Kathy |last=Lohr |work=National Public Radio |date=January 14, 2009 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99170822 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://utahstaffingcompanies.com/helpful-tips-for-employers/unemployment-benefits-eligibility/ | title=Utah staffing companies &#124; Just another WordPress site}}</ref> In practice, it is only practical to verify whether the worker quit or was fired. If the worker's claim is denied, then they have the right to appeal. If the worker was fired for misconduct, then the employer has the burden to prove that the termination of employment is a misconduct defined by individual states laws.<ref name=\"ctdol.state.ct.us\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ctdol.state.ct.us/progsupt/unemplt/new-faqui.htm|title=Unemployment Insurance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)|publisher=State of Connecticut Department of Labor}}</ref> However, if the employee quit their job, then they must prove that their voluntary separation must be good cause.\n\nGenerally, the worker must be unemployed through no fault of his/her own although workers often file for benefits they are not entitled to; when the employer demonstrates that the unemployed person quit or was fired for cause the worker is required to pay back the benefits they received. The unemployed person must also meet state requirements for wages earned or time worked during an established period of time (referred to as a \"base period\") to be eligible for benefits. In most states, the base period is usually the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters prior to the time that the claim is filed.<ref name=\"State Unemployment Benefits\">[http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/uifactsheet.asp State Unemployment Benefits] ''US Department of Labor''</ref> Unemployment benefits are based on reported covered quarterly earnings. The amount of earnings and the number of quarters worked are used to determine the length and value of the unemployment benefit. The average weekly in 2010 payment was $293.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/08/AR2010030804927.html|title=Are unemployment benefits no longer temporary?|last=Fletcher|first=Michael A.|date=March 9, 2010|work=The Washington Post|last2=Hedgpeth|first2=Dana|access-date=September 4, 2016|via=}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] passed in February 2009, many unemployed people receive up to [[99ers|99 weeks]] of unemployment benefits; this may depend on State legislation. Before the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the maximum number of weeks allowed was 26.\n\n==Application process==\nIt generally takes two weeks for benefit payments to begin, the first being a \"waiting week\", which is not reimbursed, and the second being the time lag between eligibility for the program and the first benefit actually being paid.\n\nTo begin a claim, the unemployed worker must apply for benefits through a state unemployment agency.<ref name=\"State Unemployment Benefits\"/> In certain instances, the employer initiates the process. Generally, the certification includes the affected person affirming that they are \"able and available for work\", the amount of any part-time earnings they may have had, and whether they are actively seeking work. These certifications are usually accomplished either over the Internet or via an interactive voice response telephone call, but in a few states may be by mail. After receiving an application, the state will notify the individual if they qualify and the rate they will receive every week. The state will also review the reason for separation from employment. Many states require the individual to periodically certify that the conditions of the benefits are still met.\n\n==Disqualification/Appeals==\n\nIf a worker's reason for separation from their last job is due to some reason other than a \"lack of work,\" a determination will be made about whether they are eligible for benefits. Generally, all determinations of eligibility for benefits are made by the appropriate state under its law or applicable federal laws. If a worker is disqualified or denied benefits, they have the right to file an appeal within an established time-frame. The state will advise a worker of his or her appeal rights. An employer may also appeal a determination if they do not agree with the state's determination regarding the employee's eligibility.<ref name=\"State Unemployment Benefits\"/> If the worker's claim is denied, then they have the right to appeal. If the worker was fired for misconduct, then the employer has the burden to prove substantially that the termination of employment is a misconduct defined by individual states laws.<ref name=\"ctdol.state.ct.us\"/> However, if the employee quit their job, then they must prove that their voluntary separation must be for good cause.

Eligibility requirements for unemployment insurance vary by state, but generally speaking, employees not fired for misconduct (\"terminated for cause\") are eligible for unemployment benefits, while those fired for misconduct (this sometimes can include misconduct committed outside the workplace, such as a problematic social media post or committing a crime) are not.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-wrongful-termination-2061658|title=How to Handle a Wrongful Termination|publisher=thebalance.com}}</ref>\n\nIn every state, employees who quit their job without \"good cause\" are not eligible for unemployment benefits, but the definition of good cause varies by state. In some states, being fired for misconduct permanently bars the employee from receiving unemployment benefits, while in others it only disqualifies the employee for a short period. This compensation is classified as a type of social welfare benefit. According to the [[Internal Revenue Code]], these types of benefits are to be included in a taxpayer's gross income.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tax Topics \u2013 Topic 418 Unemployment Compensation |work=Internal Revenue Service |url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc418.html }}</ref>\n\nThe standard time-length of unemployment compensation is six months, although extensions are possible during economic downturns.

Some state laws differ from the federal law.<ref name=\"LABOR UNEMPLOY\"/>\n\nTo facilitate this program, the [[U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act]] (FUTA), which authorizes the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) to collect an annual federal employer tax used to fund state workforce agencies. FUTA covers the costs of administering the Unemployment Insurance and Job Service programs in all states. In addition, FUTA pays one-half of the cost of extended unemployment benefits which are triggered in periods of high state unemployment. FUTA also provides a fund from which states UI funds may borrow to pay benefits. As originally established, the states paid the federal government.<ref name=\"LABOR UNEMPLOY\"/>\n\nUntil June 2011, the FUTA tax rate was 3% of taxable wages collected from employers of at least four employees,<ref name=\"UNEMPLOY 182\">{{cite book|title=''State and Local Government''|last=Zimmerman|first=Joseph F.|publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]]|year=1970|isbn=|location=[[New York, New York]]|pages=182}}</ref> and employers could deduct up to 90% of the amount due if they paid taxes to a state to support a system of unemployment insurance which met Federal standards.<ref name=\"UNEMPLOY 213\">{{cite book |last=Zimmerman |first=Joseph F. |title= ''State and Local Government'' |year= 1970 |publisher= [[Barnes & Noble]] |location=New York, NY |isbn= | pages=213}}</ref> As of 30 June 2011, the FUTA tax rate is 6.0% of taxable wages of employees who meet both the above and following criteria,<ref name=\"LABOR UNEMPLOY\"/> and the taxable wage base is the first $7,000 paid in wages to each employee during a calendar year.<ref name=\"LABOR UNEMPLOY\"/> Employers who pay the state unemployment tax on time receive an offset credit of up to 5.4% regardless of the rate of tax they pay their state. Therefore, the net FUTA tax rate is generally 0.6% (6.0% \u2013 5.4%), for a maximum FUTA tax of $42.00 per employee, per year (.006 X $7,000 = $42.00). State law determines individual state unemployment insurance tax rates.<ref name=\"LABOR UNEMPLOY\"/> In the United States, unemployment insurance tax rates use [[experience rating]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/lavape/9615.html|title=Unemployment Insurance Experience Rating of Firms and Layoffs|first1=P.

The federal government sets broad guidelines for coverage and eligibility, but states vary in how they determine benefits and eligibility.\n\nFederal rules are drawn by the [[United States Department of Labor]], Employment and Training Administration. For most states, the maximum period for receiving benefits is 26 weeks. There is an extended benefit program (authorized through the Social Security Acts) that may be triggered by the state unemployment rate. Congress has often passed temporary programs to extend benefits during recessions. This was done with the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation (TEUC) program in 2002\u20132003, which has since expired,<ref>{{cite news |title= Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation |work=Employment & Training Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |url= http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/factsheetteuc.asp}}</ref> and remained in force through 2 June 2010, with the Extended Unemployment Compensation 2008 legislation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Emergency Unemployment Compensation 2008 (EUC) Program |work=Employment & Training Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |url= http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/euc08.pdf }}</ref> In July 2010, legislation that provides an extension of federal extended unemployment benefits through November 2010 was signed by the president. The legislation extended benefits for 2.3 million unemployed workers who had exhausted their unemployment benefits.\n\nThe federal government lends money to the states for unemployment insurance when states run short of funds which happens when the state's UI fund cannot cover the cost of current benefits. A high unemployment rate shrinks UI tax revenues and increases expenditures on benefits. State UI finances and the need for loans are exacerbated when a state cuts taxes and increases benefits. FUTA loans to state funds are repaid with interest.\n\nCongressional actions to increase penalties for states incurring large debts for unemployment benefits led to state fiscal crises in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nOne interesting feature of the UI tax is that it targets firms that have recently had layoffs, potentially hitting distressed firms. Recent work shows that UI tax increases significantly reduce hiring and employment in affected firms, potentially eroding the macroeconomics stabilizing influence of the UI program.<ref>{{cite news |title=Unemployment Insurance Taxes and Labor Demand: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Administrative Data |work=SSRN Repository |publisher=Working Paper |ssrn=3062412 }}</ref>\n\n==Eligibility and amount==\nIn order to receive benefits, a person must have worked for at least one quarter in the previous year and have been laid-off by an employer. Workers who were temporary or were paid under the table are not eligible for unemployment insurance. If a worker quits without good cause or is fired for misconduct, then they are normally not eligible for UI benefits. There are five common reasons a claim for unemployment benefits are denied: the worker is unavailable for work, the worker quit his or her job without good cause, the worker was fired for misconduct, refusing suitable work, and unemployment resulting from a labor dispute.<ref>{{cite news |title=Unemployed Without Benefits: A Couple's Struggle |first=Kathy |last=Lohr |work=National Public Radio |date=14 January 2009 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99170822 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://utahstaffingcompanies.com/helpful-tips-for-employers/unemployment-benefits-eligibility/ | title=Utah staffing companies &#124; Just another WordPress site}}</ref> In practice, it is only practical to verify whether the worker quit or was fired. If the worker's claim is denied, then they have the right to appeal.

The unemployed person must also meet state requirements for wages earned or time worked during an established period of time (referred to as a \"base period\") to be eligible for benefits. In most states, the base period is usually the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters prior to the time that the claim is filed.<ref name=\"State Unemployment Benefits\">[http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/uifactsheet.asp State Unemployment Benefits] ''US Department of Labor''</ref> Unemployment benefits are based on reported covered quarterly earnings.

Before the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the maximum number of weeks allowed was 26.\n\n==Application process==\nIt generally takes two weeks for benefit payments to begin, the first being a \"waiting week\", which is not reimbursed, and the second being the time lag between eligibility for the program and the first benefit actually being paid.\n\nTo begin a claim, the unemployed worker must apply for benefits through a state unemployment agency.<ref name=\"State Unemployment Benefits\"/> In certain instances, the employer initiates the process. Generally, the certification includes the affected person affirming that they are \"able and available for work\", the amount of any part-time earnings they may have had, and whether they are actively seeking work. These certifications are usually accomplished either over the Internet or via an interactive voice response telephone call, but in a few states may be by mail. After receiving an application, the state will notify the individual if they qualify and the rate they will receive every week. The state will also review the reason for separation from employment. Many states require the individual to periodically certify that the conditions of the benefits are still met.\n\n==Disqualification/Appeals==\n\nIf a worker's reason for separation from their last job is due to some reason other than a \"lack of work,\" a determination will be made about whether they are eligible for benefits. Generally, all determinations of eligibility for benefits are made by the appropriate state under its law or applicable federal laws. If a worker is disqualified or denied benefits, they have the right to file an appeal within an established time-frame. The state will advise a worker of his or her appeal rights. An employer may also appeal a determination if they do not agree with the state's determination regarding the employee's eligibility.<ref name=\"State Unemployment Benefits\"/> If the worker's claim is denied, then they have the right to appeal. If the worker was fired for misconduct, then the employer has the burden to prove substantially that the termination of employment is a misconduct defined by individual states laws.<ref name=\"ctdol.state.ct.us\"/> However, if the employee quit their job, then they must prove that their voluntary separation must be for good cause.
