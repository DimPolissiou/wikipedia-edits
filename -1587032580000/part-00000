In practice and in its aims, program management is often closely related to [[systems engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[change management]], and [[business transformation]]. In the defense sector, it is the dominant approach to managing very large projects. Because major defense programs entail working with contractors, it is often called acquisition management, indicating that the government buyer acquires goods and services by means of contractors. \n\nThe program manager has oversight of the purpose and status of the projects in a program and can use this oversight to support project-level activity to ensure the program goals are met by providing a decision-making capacity that cannot be achieved at project level or by providing the [[project manager]] with a program perspective when required, or as a sounding board for ideas and approaches to solving project issues that have program impacts. The program manager may be well placed to provide this insight by actively seeking out such information from the project managers although in large and/or complex projects, a specific role may be required. However this insight arises, the program manager needs this in order to be comfortable that the overall program goals are achievable.\n\n== Overview and definition ==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}\nMany programs focus on delivering a capability to change, and are normally designed to deliver the organisation's strategy or business transformation. Program management also emphasizes the coordinating and prioritizing of [[Resource (project management)|resources]] across projects, managing links between the projects and the overall costs and risks of the program.\n\nAccording to one source, \"a Program is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits and control NOT available from managing them individually.  Programs may include elements of related [[Work (project management)|work]] outside of the [[Scope (project management)|scope]] of the discrete projects in the program...  Some projects within a program can deliver useful incremental benefits to the organization before the program itself has completed.\"<ref>{{cite book | title=The Standard for Program Management, Second Edition | publisher=Project Management Institute | year=2011}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative source (the UK Office  of Government Commerce) uses the following definition, \"a programme is a temporary flexible organisation structure created to coordinate, direct and oversee the implementation of a set of related projects and activities in order to deliver outcomes and benefits related to an organisations strategic objectives. A programme is likely to have a life that spans several years. \"<ref>{{cite book | title=Managing Successful Programmes, 2011| publisher= TSO | year=2011}}</ref>\n\nThe different spellings are relevant, Program is the US spelling and Programme is the UK spelling. The differences are far greater than spelling and reflect different philosophies. The US approach is focused on internal controls and delivery of complex projects and has grown our of the project industry, the UK approach is more focused on the achievement of all aspects of achieving a strategic objective and has grown out of the strategic change industry. This leads to inherent differences in the approach.There is no suggestion that either approach is right or wrong, in fact, they are complimentary in many ways.\n\nProgram management may provide a layer above the management of projects and focuses on selecting the best group of projects, defining them in terms of their objectives and providing an environment where projects can be run successfully. Program managers should not micromanage, but should leave project management to the project managers.  However, program management might need to deal with interdependencies, conflicts and resource or knowledge sharing among the projects it manages.\n\nIn public sector work in  [[Europe]], the term normally refers to multiple change projects: projects that are designed to deliver benefits to the host organization. For example, the [[Office of Government Commerce]] for the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK government]]. An alternative to the Office of Government Commerce's methodology for program management is that of the private sector [[Project Management Institute]].\n\nMany organizations only run one program at a time, a program containing all their projects. In [[Project Management Institute]] terminology, this is more likely to be a project portfolio than a program.   Some larger organizations may have multiple programs each designed to deliver a range of improvements. Some organizations use the concept of [[Systems engineering|Systems Engineering]] where others use program management.\n\n==Key factors==\n;Benefits: The key difference between a project and a programme is that benefits are delivering within the programme lifecycle compared to a project when they are delivered after the project has finished, this  is a vital distinction as benefits management is the driving force within successful programmes.', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p75</ref>\n;Governance: The structure, process, and procedure to control internal operations and changes to performance objectives. Governance must include a set of metrics to indicate the health and progress of the program in the most vital areas.\n;Alignment: The program must support a higher level vision, goals and objectives. These are set out in the programme Vision and blueprint, which defines the future state for the organisation, sector or community that will be significantly changed, Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p107</ref>\n;Transformation: A programme will deliver major change, whether it is within an organisation, an sector or a community. As such the management of change and transition is a key characteristic of a programme, not just the building a major capability.', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p107</ref>\n;Assurance: Verify and validate the program, ensuring adherence to standards and alignment with the vision. Programmes should always have an Assurance Strategy.', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p162</ref>\n;Management: Ensure there are regular reviews, there is [[accountability]], and that management of projects, [[Project stakeholders|stakeholders]] and suppliers is in place.\n;Integration: Ensure that component parts fit together properly to make the intended whole. Optimize performance across the program [[value chain]], functionally and technically.\n;Finances: Track basic costs together with wider costs of administering the program and also the costs of change and transition to achieve benefits.\n;Infrastructure: Allocation of resources influences the cost and success of the program. Infrastructure might cover offices, [[version control]], and IT.\n;Planning: Develop the plan bringing together the information on projects, resources, timescales, monitoring and control.<ref>''Managing Successful Programmes'', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p107</ref>\n;Improvement: Continuously assess performance; research and develop new capabilities; and systemically apply learning and knowledge to the program.', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p155</ref>\n\n== Comparison with project management==\nThere are the two different views of how programs differ from projects. In one view, projects deliver outputs, discrete parcels or \"chunks\" of change;<ref>''All Change'' Eddie Obeng Financial Times Publishing 1994</ref> programs create outcomes.<ref>The Gower Handbook of Programme Management</ref> In this view, a project might deliver a new factory, hospital or IT system. By combining these projects with other [[deliverable]]s and changes, their programs might deliver increased income from a new product, shorter waiting lists at the hospital or reduced operating costs due to improved technology. The other view<ref>The Definitive Guide to Project Management. Nokes, Sebastian. London (Financial Times / Prentice Hall): 2007</ref> is that a program is nothing more than either a large project or a set (or portfolio) of projects. In this second view, the point of having a program is to exploit economies of scale and to reduce coordination costs and risks. The project manager's job is to ensure that their project succeeds. The program manager, on the other hand, is concerned with the aggregate outcome(s) or end-state result(s) of the collection of projects in a particular program. For example, in a financial institution a program may include one project that is designed to take advantage of a rising market and another that is designed to protect against the downside of a falling market. The former seeks to leverage the potential upside; the latter to limit the possible downside. Consider a simple analogy: Fix-A-Flat\u00ae.  This highly pressurized aerosol product injects a leak sealant into a punctured tire to stop the outflow of air (project A) and concurrently re-inflates the tire (project B), resulting together in the outcome that is a tire that is once again functional (the program comprised projects A and B).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.project-laneways.com.au/certification-courses/programme-management/financial-programme-management | title=How Project Managers Deal With Opposing Projects in a Financial Programme | publisher=Project Laneways | accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the view that programs deliver outcomes but projects deliver outputs, program management is concerned with doing the right projects. The program manager has been described as 'playing chess' and keeping the overview in mind, with the pieces to be used or sacrificed being the projects.<ref>''Putting Strategy to Work'' Eddie Obeng Financial Times Publishing 1996</ref>  In contrast, [[project management]] is about doing projects right. And also according to this view, successful projects deliver on time, to budget and to specification, whereas successful programs deliver long term improvements to an organization. Improvements are usually identified through benefits. An organization should select the group of programs that most take it towards its strategic aims while remaining within its capacity to deliver the changes. On the other hand, the view that programs are simply large projects or a set of projects allows that a program may need to deliver tangible benefits quickly.\n\nAccording to one source, the key difference between a program and a project is the finite nature of a project<ref name=\"PMH\">Prieto, Robert, [http://www.pmhut.com/how-program-management-differs-from-project-management How Program Management Differs from Project Management], PM Hut. Accessed 17. Oct 2009.</ref> - a project must always have a specific end date, else it is an ongoing program.\n\nOne view of the differences between a program and a project in business is that:\n# A project is unique and is of definite [[Duration (project management)|duration]]. A program is ongoing and implemented within a business to consistently achieve certain results for the business.\n# A project is designed to deliver an output or deliverable and its success will be in terms of delivering the right output at the right time and to the right cost.\n# Program management includes management of projects which, together, improve the performance of the organization. A program's success will be measured in terms of benefits.\n# Benefits are the measures of improvement of an organization and might include increased income, increased profits, decreased costs, improved market position (ability to compete), reduced wastage or environmental damage, more satisfied customers. In central or local government organizations, benefits might include providing a better service to the community.\n# In the course of achieving required results, business programs will normally understand related business constraints and determine the processes required to achieve results based on resources allocated.  Improvement of processes is a continuous operation that very much contrasts a program from a project.\n# At the lowest level project managers co-ordinate individual projects. They are overseen by the program manager who accounts to the [[Executive sponsor|program sponsor]] (or board).\n# There will normally be a process to change the predetermined scope of a project. Programs often have to react to changes in strategy and changes in the environment in which the organization changes.\n\nAnother view and another successful way of managing does not see any of the factors listed above as distinguishing projects from programs, but rather sees the program as being about portfolio management. On this view, program management is about selecting projects, adjusting the speed at which they run, and adjusting their scope, in order to the maximize the value of the portfolio as a whole, and as economic or other external conditions change. Still, some emphasize that whereas a portfolio consists of independent projects, a program is a collection of interdependent projects, adding a dimension of complexity to the management task.\n\nYet another view is that a program management is nothing more than a large, complex project, where the integration aspect of project management is more important than in smaller projects. Integration management is a key feature of the [[Project Management Institute]]'s approach to project management. Yet again, some accept there is a distinction related to interdependencies between the elements of a project and a program. In this view, a program is a comparably loosely coupled system, whereas large, complex projects are tightly coupled. This difference makes the project program a more ambiguous task to manage, with more uncertainty, reflecting a higher degree of freedom and a management task more open to exploit opportunities as they arise or the program management becomes aware of them.\n\nIn practice it is not clear that there is a clear-cut distinction. Projects (or programs) vary from small and simple to large and complex; what needs to be a managed as a program in one culture or organization may be managed as a project in another.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cost overrun]]\n* [[List of project management topics]]\n* [[Project Management Institute]]\n* [[Systems engineering]]\n* [[Comparison of project management software]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\nManaging Successful Programmes, Rod Sowden et al.

Today, it is considered an [[ancillary weapon]] or a weapon of last resort.\n\n==History==\n[[File:\u5b50\u6bcd\u9ce5\u9283.png|thumb|Depiction of a 16th century Chinese breech-loading musket with a plug bayonet attached. The weapon's instructional manual and specifications is shown above.]]\n\nThe term ''bayonette'' itself dates back to the second half of the 16th century, but it is not clear whether bayonets at the time were knives that could be fitted to the ends of firearms, or simply a type of knife. For example, Cotgrave's 1611 ''Dictionarie'' describes the bayonet as \"a kind of small flat pocket dagger, furnished with knives; or a great knife to hang at the girdle\". Likewise, [[Pierre Borel]] wrote in 1655 that a kind of long-knife called a ''bayonette'' was made in [[Bayonne]] but does not give any further description.<ref>H. Blackmore, ''Hunting Weapons'', p. 50</ref>\n\n===Plug bayonets===\n[[File:Plug Bayonet 1650.JPG|thumb|17th-century plug bayonet]]\n\nThe first recorded instance of a bayonet proper is found in the Chinese military treatise {{ill|Binglu|zh|\u5175\u5f55}} published in 1606. It was in the form of the {{ill|Son-and-mother gun|zh|\u5b50\u6bcd\u9ce5\u9283}}, a [[breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] musket that was issued with a roughly {{convert|57.6|cm|adj=on|abbr=on}} long plug bayonet, giving it an overall length of {{convert|1.92|m|abbr=on}} with the bayonet attached. It was labelled as a \"gun-blade\" (traditional Chinese: {{lang|zh-Hant-TW|\u9283\u5200}}; simplified Chinese: {{lang|zh|\u94f3\u5200}}) with it being described as a \"short sword that can be inserted into the barrel and secured by twisting it slightly\" that it is to be used \"when the battle have depleted both gunpowder and bullets as well as fighting against bandits, when forces are closing into melee or encountering an ambush\" and if one \"cannot load the gun within the time it takes to cover two bu (3.2 meters) of ground they are to attach the bayonet and hold it like a spear\".<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 456\">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 456.</ref><ref name=\"Binglu \u300a\u5175\u9304\u300b, Scroll 12\">Binglu \u300a\u5175\u9304\u300b, Scroll 12.</ref>\n\nEarly bayonets were of the \"plug\" type, where the bayonet was fitted directly into the barrel of the musket.<ref name=\"COLD\">''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A847532 Cold Steel - The History of the Bayonet]'', BBC News, 18 November 2002, retrieved 29 July 2011</ref> This allowed light infantry to be converted to heavy infantry and hold off cavalry charges. The bayonet had a round handle that slid directly into the musket barrel. This naturally prevented the gun from being fired. The first known mention of the use of bayonets in European warfare was in the memoirs of Jacques de Chastenet, Vicomte de Puys\u00e9gur.<ref name=\"worldbayonets.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://worldbayonets.com/Historical%20Timeline/Bayonet_Timeline_1647.html |title=Bayonet History Timeline - 1647 First Military Use of the Bayonet |publisher=Worldbayonets.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-20}}</ref> He described the French using crude {{convert|1|ft|adj=on}} plug bayonets during the [[Thirty Years' War|Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648)]].<ref name=\"worldbayonets.com1\"/> However, it was not until 1671 that General Jean Martinet standardized and issued plug bayonets to the French regiment of [[fusilier]]s then raised. They were issued to part of an English [[dragoon]] regiment raised in 1672, and to the Royal Fusiliers when raised in 1685.\n\n===Socket bayonets===\n[[File:Musee-historique-lausanne-img 0095.jpg|thumb|left|Socket of a bayonet]]\n[[File:Bayonette-p1000740.jpg|thumb|Early 19th-century offset spiked socket bayonet]]\n\nThe major problem with plug bayonets was that when attached they made it impossible to fire the musket, requiring soldiers to wait until the last possible moment before a [[melee]] to fix the bayonet. The defeat of forces loyal to [[William III of England|William of Orange]] by [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] Highlanders at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] in 1689 was due (among other things) to the use of the plug bayonet.<ref name=\"COLD\"/> The Highlanders closed to 50 metres, fired a single volley, dropped their muskets, and using axes and swords quickly overwhelmed the loyalists before they had time to fix bayonets. Shortly thereafter, the defeated leader, [[Hugh Mackay (general)|Hugh Mackay]], is believed to have introduced a socket bayonet of his own invention. Soon \"socket\" bayonets would incorporate both socket mounts and an offset blade that fit around the musket's barrel, which allowed the musket to be fired and reloaded while the bayonet was attached.\n\nAn unsuccessful trial with socket or zigzag bayonets was made after the [[battle of Fleurus (1690)|Battle of Fleurus]] in 1690, in the presence of [[King Louis XIV]], who refused to adopt them, as they had a tendency to fall off the musket. Shortly after the [[Peace of Ryswick]] (1697), the English and Germans abolished the [[pike (weapon)|pike]] and introduced socket bayonets. The British socket bayonet had a triangular blade with a flat side towards the muzzle and two fluted sides outermost to a length of {{convert|15|in|cm}}. However it had no lock to keep it fast to the muzzle and was well-documented for falling off in the heat of battle.<ref name=\"COLD\"/>\n\nBy the 18th century, socket bayonets had been adopted by most European armies. In 1703, the French infantry adopted a spring-loaded locking system that prevented the bayonet from accidentally separating from the musket. A triangular blade was introduced around 1715 and was stronger than the previous single or double-edged models, creating wounds which were harder to treat due to the propensity of healing scar tissue to pull apart the triangular incision.\n\n===Sword bayonets===\n[[File:Baker rifle.png|thumb|Baker Rifle with sword bayonet]]\n\nThe 19th century introduced the concept of the [[sword bayonet]], a long-bladed weapon with a single- or double-edged blade that could also be used as a [[Classification of swords|shortsword]]. Its initial purpose was to ensure that riflemen could form an [[infantry square]] properly to fend off cavalry attacks when in ranks with musketmen, whose weapons were longer. A prime early example of a sword bayonet-fitted rifle is the British Infantry Rifle of 1800\u20131840, later known as the \"[[Baker Rifle]]\". The hilt usually had [[quillons]] modified to accommodate the [[gun barrel]] and a [[hilt]] mechanism that enabled the bayonet to be attached to a [[bayonet lug]]. A sword bayonet could be used in combat as a [[Sidearm (weapon)|side arm]]. When attached to the musket or rifle, it effectively turned almost any [[long gun]] into a spear or [[glaive]], suitable not only for thrusting but also for slashing.\n\n[[File:Chassepot-diag.jpg|thumb|Chassepot bolt-action rifle and sword bayonet.]]\n\nWhile the British Army eventually discarded the sword bayonet, the socket bayonet survived the introduction of the rifled musket into British service in 1854. The new rifled musket copied the French locking ring system.<ref name=\"COLD\"/> The new bayonet proved its worth at the [[Battle of Alma]] and the [[Battle of Inkerman]] during the [[Crimean War]], where the Imperial Russian Army learned to fear it.<ref name=\"COLD\"/>\n\n[[File:Chassepot bayonet assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Bayonet assembly system of the [[Chassepot]]]]\n\nFrom 1869, some European nations began to develop new [[bolt-action]] [[breech-loading weapon|breechloading]] [[rifle]]s (such as the [[Chassepot]]) and sword bayonets suitable for mass production and for use by police, pioneer, and engineer troops.<ref name=\"OWE\">Owen, John Ivor Headon, ''Brassey's Infantry Weapons of the World: Infantry Weapons and Combat Aids in Current Use by the Regular and Reserve Forces of All Nations'', Bonanza Press, {{ISBN|0-517-24234-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-517-24234-6}} (1975), p. 265</ref> The decision to redesign the bayonet into a short sword was viewed by some as an acknowledgement of the decline in importance of the fixed bayonet as a weapon in the face of new advances in firearms technology.<ref name=\"PUN\">Punch, \"The Soldier's Side-Companion\", ''Punch's Almanack For 1869'', Vol. 57 (7 August 1869), London: Punch Publications Ltd.

As early as the 19th century, military scholars were already noting that most bayonet charges did not result in close combat. Instead, one side usually fled before actual bayonet fighting ensued. The act of fixing bayonets has been held to be primarily connected to morale, the making of a clear signal to friend and foe of a willingness to kill at close quarters.<ref>{{cite book |title=Firing Line |last=Holmes |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Holmes (military historian)|year=1987 |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth |isbn=978-0-14-008574-7|pages=377\u20139}}</ref>\n\n===Napoleonic wars===\n[[File:Gro\u00dfbeeren 1813.jpg|thumb|A bayonet charge during the [[Battle of Gro\u00dfbeeren]] (1813)]]\n\nThe bayonet charge was a common tactic used during the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Despite its effectiveness, a bayonet charge did not necessarily cause substantial casualties through the use of the weapon itself. Detailed battle casualty lists from the 18th century showed that in many battles, fewer than 2% of all wounds treated were caused by bayonets.<ref>Lynn, John A. Giant of the Grand Si\u00e8cle: The French Army, 1610-1715. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1997. Print.</ref> [[Antoine-Henri Jomini]], a celebrated military author who served in numerous armies during the [[Napoleon]]ic period, stated that the majority of bayonet charges in the open resulted with one side fleeing before any contact was made. Combat with bayonets did occur, but mostly on a small scale when units of opposing sides encountered each other in a confined environment, such as during the storming of fortifications or during ambush skirmishes in broken terrain.<ref>Jomini, Antoine Henri. The Art of War. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1971. Print.</ref> In an age of fire by [[Volley fire|massed volley]], when compared to random unseen bullets, the threat of the bayonet was much more tangible and immediate \u2013 guaranteed to lead to a personal gruesome conclusion if both sides persisted. All this encouraged men to flee before the lines met. Thus, the bayonet was an immensely useful weapon for capturing ground from the enemy, despite seldom actually being used to inflict wounds.\n\n===American Civil War===\n[[File:Currier-Ives Third Petersburg.jpg|thumb|A bayonet charge during the American Civil War]]\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865) the bayonet was found to be responsible for less than 1% of battlefield casualties,<ref>O'Connell, Robert L., \"Arme Blanche\", ''Military History Quarterly'', Vol. 5, n\u00ba 1.</ref> a hallmark of [[modern warfare]]. The use of bayonet charges to force the enemy to retreat was very successful in numerous small unit engagements at short range in the American Civil War, as most troops would retreat when charged while reloading (which could take up to a minute with loose powder even for trained troops). Although such charges inflicted few casualties, they often decided short engagements, and tactical possession of important defensive ground features. Additionally, bayonet drill could be used to rally men temporarily discomfited by enemy fire.<ref>The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War</ref>\n \nWhile the overall [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was won by the Union armies due to a combination of terrain and massed artillery fire, a decisive point on the second day of the battle hinged on a bayonet charge at [[Little Round Top]] when the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], running short of musket ammunition, charged downhill, surprising and capturing many of the surviving soldiers of the 15th Alabama and other Confederate regiments.\n\n===Going over the top===\n[[File:Cpe french bayonet 01.jpg|thumb|French infantry bayonet charge during the First World War. The men are carrying [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|1886 Lebel rifles]].]]\n\nThe popular image of a World War I combat is of a wave of soldiers with bayonets fixed, \"going over the top\" and charging across [[no man's land]] into a hail of enemy fire.

But, by the end of the war, against well organized and heavily armed American forces, a banzai charge inflicted little damage while its participants suffered horrendous losses. At best, they were conducted as a last resort by small groups of surviving soldiers when the main battle was already lost. At worst, they threw away valuable resources in men and arms in suicidal attacks, which only hastened defeat.\n\nSome Japanese commanders, such as General [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]], recognized the futility and waste of such attacks and expressly forbade their men from carrying them out. Indeed, the Americans were surprised that the Japanese did not employ banzai charges at the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]].<ref>{{cite book|first= Wright|last=Derrick|authorlink=Derrick Wright|title=The Battle for Iwo Jima|publisher=[[Sutton Publishing]]|year=2006|page=80}}</ref><ref>According to military historian Shigetoki Hosoki, \"This writer was stunned to find the following comments in the 'Iwo Jima Report', a collection of [[memoir]]s by Iwo Jima survivors.

Nonetheless, these emaciated soldiers who looked like they came from [[Mars]] faced the enemy with a force that could not be believed. I sensed a high [[morale]].' Even under such circumstances, the underground shelters that the Japanese built proved advantageous for a while. Enemy mortar and bombing could not reach them ten meters underground. It was then that the Americans began to dig holes and poured yellow [[phosphorus]] gas into the ground. Their infantry was also burning its way through passages, slowly but surely, at the rate of ten meters per hour. A telegram has been preserved which says, 'This is like killing [[cockroach]]es.'

The term \"at the point of a bayonet\" refers to using military force or action to accomplish, maintain, or defend something (cf. [[Bayonet Constitution]]). Undertaking a task \"with fixed bayonets\" has this connotation of no room for compromise and is a phrase used particularly in politics.\n\n==Badges and insignias==\nThe [[Australian Army]] [[Rising Sun (badge)|'Rising Sun' badge]] features a semicircle of bayonets. The Australian Army Infantry Combat Badge (ICB) takes the form of a vertically mounted Australian Army SLR (7.62mm self-loading rifle FN FAL) bayonet surrounded by an oval-shaped laurel wreath.<ref>[[Infantry combat badge]]</ref> The US Army [[Combat Action Badge]], awarded to personnel who have come under fire since 2001 and who are not eligible for the [[Combat Infantryman Badge]] (due to the fact that only Infantry personnel may be awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge), has a bayonet as its central motif.\n\nThe shoulder sleeve insignia for the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]] in the US Army features crossed bayonets. The US Army's [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team]]'s shoulder patch features a bayonet wrapped in a wing, symbolizing their airborne status. The brigade regularly deploys in task forces under the name \"Bayonet\". The insignia of the British Army's [[School of Infantry]] is an SA80 bayonet against a red shield. It is worn as a [[Tactical recognition flash]] (TRF) by instructors at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre]] Catterick, the [[Infantry Battle School]] at [[Brecon]] and the Support Weapons School in [[Warminster]].\n\nThe vocation tab collar insignia for the Singapore Armed Forces Infantry Formation utilizes two crossed bayonets.

The weapon's instructional manual and specifications is shown above.]]\n\nThe term ''bayonette'' itself dates back to the second half of the 16th century, but it is not clear whether bayonets at the time were knives that could be fitted to the ends of firearms, or simply a type of knife. For example, Cotgrave's 1611 ''Dictionarie'' describes the bayonet as \"a kind of small flat pocket dagger, furnished with knives; or a great knife to hang at the girdle\". Likewise, [[Pierre Borel]] wrote in 1655 that a kind of long-knife called a ''bayonette'' was made in [[Bayonne]] but does not give any further description.<ref>H. Blackmore, ''Hunting Weapons'', p. 50</ref>\n\n===Plug bayonets===\n[[File:Plug Bayonet 1650.JPG|thumb|17th-century plug bayonet]]\n\nThe first recorded instance of a bayonet proper is found in the Chinese military treatise {{ill|Binglu|zh|\u5175\u5f55}} published in 1606. It was in the form of the {{ill|Son-and-mother gun|zh|\u5b50\u6bcd\u9ce5\u9283}}, a [[breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] musket that was issued with a roughly {{convert|57.6|cm|adj=on|abbr=on}} long plug bayonet, giving it an overall length of {{convert|1.92|m|abbr=on}} with the bayonet attached. It was labelled as a \"gun-blade\" (traditional Chinese: {{lang|zh-Hant-TW|\u9283\u5200}}; simplified Chinese: {{lang|zh|\u94f3\u5200}}) with it being described as a \"short sword that can be inserted into the barrel and secured by twisting it slightly\" that it is to be used \"when the battle have depleted both gunpowder and bullets as well as fighting against bandits, when forces are closing into melee or encountering an ambush\" and if one \"cannot load the gun within the time it takes to cover two bu (3.2 meters) of ground they are to attach the bayonet and hold it like a spear\".<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 456\">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 456.</ref><ref name=\"Binglu \u300a\u5175\u9304\u300b, Scroll 12\">Binglu \u300a\u5175\u9304\u300b, Scroll 12.</ref>\n\nEarly bayonets were of the \"plug\" type, where the bayonet was fitted directly into the barrel of the musket.<ref name=\"COLD\">''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A847532 Cold Steel - The History of the Bayonet]'', BBC News, 18 November 2002, retrieved 29 July 2011</ref> This allowed light infantry to be converted to heavy infantry and hold off cavalry charges. The bayonet had a round handle that slid directly into the musket barrel. This naturally prevented the gun from being fired. The first known mention of the use of bayonets in European warfare was in the memoirs of Jacques de Chastenet, Vicomte de Puys\u00e9gur.<ref name=\"worldbayonets.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://worldbayonets.com/Historical%20Timeline/Bayonet_Timeline_1647.html |title=Bayonet History Timeline - 1647 First Military Use of the Bayonet |publisher=Worldbayonets.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-20}}</ref> He described the French using crude {{convert|1|ft|adj=on}} plug bayonets during the [[Thirty Years' War|Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648)]].<ref name=\"worldbayonets.com1\"/> However, it was not until 1671 that General Jean Martinet standardized and issued plug bayonets to the French regiment of [[fusilier]]s then raised. They were issued to part of an English [[dragoon]] regiment raised in 1672, and to the Royal Fusiliers when raised in 1685.\n\n===Socket bayonets===\n[[File:Musee-historique-lausanne-img 0095.jpg|thumb|left|Socket of a bayonet]]\n[[File:Bayonette-p1000740.jpg|thumb|Early 19th-century offset spiked socket bayonet]]\n\nThe major problem with plug bayonets was that when attached they made it impossible to fire the musket, requiring soldiers to wait until the last possible moment before a [[melee]] to fix the bayonet. The defeat of forces loyal to [[William III of England|William of Orange]] by [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] Highlanders at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] in 1689 was due (among other things) to the use of the plug bayonet.<ref name=\"COLD\"/> The Highlanders closed to 50 metres, fired a single volley, dropped their muskets, and using axes and swords quickly overwhelmed the loyalists before they had time to fix bayonets. Shortly thereafter, the defeated leader, [[Hugh Mackay (general)|Hugh Mackay]], is believed to have introduced a socket bayonet of his own invention. Soon \"socket\" bayonets would incorporate both socket mounts and an offset blade that fit around the musket's barrel, which allowed the musket to be fired and reloaded while the bayonet was attached.\n\nAn unsuccessful trial with socket or zigzag bayonets was made after the [[battle of Fleurus (1690)|Battle of Fleurus]] in 1690, in the presence of [[King Louis XIV]], who refused to adopt them, as they had a tendency to fall off the musket. Shortly after the [[Peace of Ryswick]] (1697), the English and Germans abolished the [[pike (weapon)|pike]] and introduced socket bayonets. The British socket bayonet had a triangular blade with a flat side towards the muzzle and two fluted sides outermost to a length of {{convert|15|in|cm}}. However it had no lock to keep it fast to the muzzle and was well-documented for falling off in the heat of battle.<ref name=\"COLD\"/>\n\nBy the 18th century, socket bayonets had been adopted by most European armies. In 1703, the French infantry adopted a spring-loaded locking system that prevented the bayonet from accidentally separating from the musket. A triangular blade was introduced around 1715 and was stronger than the previous single or double-edged models, creating wounds which were harder to treat due to the propensity of healing scar tissue to pull apart the triangular incision.\n\n===Sword bayonets===\n[[File:Baker rifle.png|thumb|Baker Rifle with sword bayonet]]\n\nThe 19th century introduced the concept of the [[sword bayonet]], a long-bladed weapon with a single- or double-edged blade that could also be used as a [[Classification of swords|shortsword]]. Its initial purpose was to ensure that riflemen could form an [[infantry square]] properly to fend off cavalry attacks when in ranks with musketmen, whose weapons were longer. A prime early example of a sword bayonet-fitted rifle is the British Infantry Rifle of 1800\u20131840, later known as the \"[[Baker Rifle]]\". The hilt usually had [[quillons]] modified to accommodate the [[gun barrel]] and a [[hilt]] mechanism that enabled the bayonet to be attached to a [[bayonet lug]]. A sword bayonet could be used in combat as a [[Sidearm (weapon)|side arm]]. When attached to the musket or rifle, it effectively turned almost any [[long gun]] into a spear or [[glaive]], suitable not only for thrusting but also for slashing.\n\n[[File:Chassepot-diag.jpg|thumb|Chassepot bolt-action rifle and sword bayonet.]]\n\nWhile the British Army eventually discarded the sword bayonet, the socket bayonet survived the introduction of the rifled musket into British service in 1854. The new rifled musket copied the French locking ring system.<ref name=\"COLD\"/> The new bayonet proved its worth at the [[Battle of Alma]] and the [[Battle of Inkerman]] during the [[Crimean War]], where the Imperial Russian Army learned to fear it.<ref name=\"COLD\"/>\n\n[[File:Chassepot bayonet assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Bayonet assembly system of the [[Chassepot]]]]\n\nFrom 1869, some European nations began to develop new [[bolt-action]] [[breech-loading weapon|breechloading]] [[rifle]]s (such as the [[Chassepot]]) and sword bayonets suitable for mass production and for use by police, pioneer, and engineer troops.<ref name=\"OWE\">Owen, John Ivor Headon, ''Brassey's Infantry Weapons of the World: Infantry Weapons and Combat Aids in Current Use by the Regular and Reserve Forces of All Nations'', Bonanza Press, {{ISBN|0-517-24234-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-517-24234-6}} (1975), p. 265</ref> The decision to redesign the bayonet into a short sword was viewed by some as an acknowledgement of the decline in importance of the fixed bayonet as a weapon in the face of new advances in firearms technology.<ref name=\"PUN\">Punch, \"The Soldier's Side-Companion\", ''Punch's Almanack For 1869'', Vol. 57 (7 August 1869), London: Punch Publications Ltd.

Despite its effectiveness, a bayonet charge did not necessarily cause substantial casualties through the use of the weapon itself. Detailed battle casualty lists from the 18th century showed that in many battles, fewer than 2% of all wounds treated were caused by bayonets.<ref>Lynn, John A.

Combat with bayonets did occur, but mostly on a small scale when units of opposing sides encountered each other in a confined environment, such as during the storming of fortifications or during ambush skirmishes in broken terrain.<ref>Jomini, Antoine Henri. The Art of War. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1971. Print.</ref> It is worth saying that bayonet attacks were useless if the enemy was not disorganized by massive fire. Otherwise, the attacking side came under oncoming fire and was easily discarded. In the [[Battle of Albuera]], a French convoy (8,000 soldiers) three times attacked the British (2,000 soldiers) position, but each time it was thrown back by British line fire. The British infantry could realize the full firepower of their muskets lined up, while the French soldiers built in a column, could only fire from the first two rows.\n===American Civil War===\n[[File:Currier-Ives Third Petersburg.jpg|thumb|A bayonet charge during the American Civil War]]\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865) the bayonet was found to be responsible for less than 1% of battlefield casualties,<ref>O'Connell, Robert L., \"Arme Blanche\", ''Military History Quarterly'', Vol. 5, n\u00ba 1.</ref> a hallmark of [[modern warfare]]. The use of bayonet charges to force the enemy to retreat was very successful in numerous small unit engagements at short range in the American Civil War, as most troops would retreat when charged while reloading (which could take up to a minute with loose powder even for trained troops).

Additionally, bayonet drill could be used to rally men temporarily discomfited by enemy fire.<ref>The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War</ref>\n \nWhile the overall [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was won by the Union armies due to a combination of terrain and massed artillery fire, a decisive point on the second day of the battle hinged on a bayonet charge at [[Little Round Top]] when the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], running short of musket ammunition, charged downhill, surprising and capturing many of the surviving soldiers of the 15th Alabama and other Confederate regiments.\n\n===Going over the top===\n[[File:Cpe french bayonet 01.jpg|thumb|French infantry bayonet charge during the First World War.

At worst, they threw away valuable resources in men and arms in suicidal attacks, which only hastened defeat.\n\nSome Japanese commanders, such as General [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]], recognized the futility and waste of such attacks and expressly forbade their men from carrying them out.

Nonetheless, these emaciated soldiers who looked like they came from [[Mars]] faced the enemy with a force that could not be believed. I sensed a high [[morale]].' Even under such circumstances, the underground shelters that the Japanese built proved advantageous for a while. Enemy mortar and bombing could not reach them ten meters underground. It was then that the Americans began to dig holes and poured yellow [[phosphorus]] gas into the ground. Their infantry was also burning its way through passages, slowly but surely, at the rate of ten meters per hour. A telegram has been preserved which says, 'This is like killing [[cockroach]]es.' American troops made daily advances to the north.

The US Army's [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team]]'s shoulder patch features a bayonet wrapped in a wing, symbolizing their airborne status.

Loess grains are [[Rounding (sediment)|angular]] with little polishing or rounding and composed of crystals of [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], [[mica]] and other [[mineral]]s. Loess can be described as a rich, dust-like soil.<ref>Pearson Prentice Hall - World Studies - Europe and Russia</ref>\n\nLoess deposits may become very thick, more than a hundred meters in areas of China and tens of meters in parts of the Midwestern United States. It generally occurs as a blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick.\n\nLoess often stands in either steep or vertical faces.<ref>Neuendorf, K.E.K., J.P. Mehl Jr., and J.A. Jackson, 2005, ''Glossary of Geology.'' [[Springer-Verlag]], [[New York City]], 779 pp., {{ISBN|3-540-27951-2}}</ref> Because the grains are angular, loess will often stand in banks for many years without [[Slump (geology)|slump]]ing. This soil has a characteristic called vertical cleavage which makes it easily excavated to form cave dwellings, a popular method of making [[yaodong|human habitations]] in some parts of China. Loess will erode very readily.\n\nIn several areas of the world, loess [[ridge]]s have formed that are aligned with the [[prevailing wind]]s during the last [[glacial maximum]].  These are called \"[[paha (landform)|paha]] ridges\" in America and \"greda ridges\" in [[Europe]].  The form of these loess [[dune]]s has been explained by a combination of wind and [[tundra]] conditions.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Loess'' comes from the German ''L\u00f6ss'' or ''L\u00f6\u00df'', and ultimately from [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] ''l\u00f6sch'' meaning ''drop'' as named by [[peasants]] and [[masonry|mason]]s along the [[Rhine|Rhine Valley]].{{clarify|reason=does not agree with referenced material in lead|date=December 2018}}\n\n==History of research==\nThe term \"L\u00f6\u00df\" was first described in Central Europe by [[Karl C\u00e4sar von Leonhard]] (1823\u20131824)<ref>Leonhard K.

During the autumn and winter, when melting of the icesheets and icecaps ceased, the flow of meltwater down these rivers either ceased or was greatly reduced. As a consequence, large parts of the formerly submerged and unvegetated floodplains of these braided rivers dried out and were exposed to the wind. Because these floodplains consist of sediment containing a high content of glacially ground flour-like [[silt]] and [[clay]], they were highly susceptible to winnowing of their silts and [[clay]]s by the wind. Once entrained by the wind, particles were then deposited downwind. The loess deposits found along both sides of the [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi River Alluvial Valley]] are a classic example of periglacial loess.<ref name=\"MuhsOthers2003a\">{{cite journal|last1=Bettis|first1=E.A.|last2=Muhs|first2=D.R.|last3=Roberts|first3=H.M.|last4=Wintle|first4=A.G.|title=Last Glacial loess in the conterminous USA|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|date=2003|volume=22|issue=18\u201319|pages=1907\u20131946|doi=10.1016/S0277-3791(03)00169-0|bibcode=2003QSRv...22.1907A}}</ref><ref name=\"esp.cr.usgs.gov\">{{cite journal|last1=Muhs|first1= D.R.|first2=E.A. |last2=Bettis, III|date=2003|url=http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/eolian/MuhsBettis2003GSAsp370.pdf |title=Quaternary loess-paleosol sequences as examples of climate-driven sedimentary extremes|journal=GSA Special Papers|volume=370|pages= 53\u201374|doi=10.1130/0-8137-2370-1.53|isbn= 9780813723709}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Quaternary]], loess and loess-like sediments were formed in periglacial environments on mid-continental [[Shield (geology)|shield]] areas in Europe and Siberia, on the margins of high mountain ranges like in [[Tajikistan]] and on semi-arid margins of some lowland deserts like in China.<ref name=\"Frechen 2011\"/>\n\nIn England, periglacial loess is also known as [[brickearth]].\n\n===Non-glacial===\nNon-glacial loess can originate from [[desert]]s, [[dune field]]s, [[playa lake]]s, and [[volcanic ash]].\n\nSome types of nonglacial loess are:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Iriondo | first1 = M.H. | last2 = Krohling | first2 = D.M. | year = 2007 | title = Non-classical types of loess | journal = [[Sedimentary Geology (journal)|Sedimentary Geology]] | volume = 202 | issue = 3| pages = 352\u2013368 | bibcode=2007SedG..202..352I | doi=10.1016/j.sedgeo.2007.03.012}}</ref>\n* [[Desert]] loess produced by aeolian attrition of quartz grains <ref>Whalley, W.B., Marshall, J.R., Smith, B.J. 1982, Origin of desert loess from some experimental observations, Nature, 300, 433-435.</ref> \n* [[Volcanic]] loess in Ecuador and Argentina;\n* [[Tropical]] loess in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay;\n* [[Gypsum]] loess in Spain;\n* [[Trade wind]] loess in Venezuela and Brazil;\n* [[Anticyclonic]] loess in Argentina.\n\nThe thick Chinese loess deposits are non-glacial loess having been blown in from deserts in northern China.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ding | first1 = Z. | last2 = Sun | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = Changes in Sand Content of Loess Deposits along a North\u2013South Transect of the Chinese Loess Plateau and the Implications for Desert Variations. | url = | journal = [[Quaternary Research]] | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 56\u201362 | doi=10.1006/qres.1999.2045| bibcode = 1999QuRes..52...56D }}</ref> The loess covering the [[Great Plains]] of [[Nebraska]], [[Kansas]], and [[Colorado]] is considered to be non-glacial desert loess.<ref name=\"MuhsOthers2003a\"/> Non-glacial desert loess is also found in Australia<ref>{{cite journal|last=Haberlah|first=D|year=2007|title=A call for Australian loess|journal=Area |volume=39 |issue=2|pages= 224\u2013229|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4762.2007.00730.x}}</ref> and Africa.<ref name=\"esp.cr.usgs.gov\"/>\n\n==Fertility==\nLoess tends to develop into very rich soils.

The fine grains [[weathering|weather]] rapidly due to their large surface area, making soils derived from loess rich.  One theory states that the fertility of loess soils is due largely to [[cation exchange capacity]] (the ability of plants to absorb nutrients from the soil) and [[porosity]] (the air-filled space in the soil). The fertility of loess is not due to organic matter content, which tends to be rather low, unlike tropical soils which derive their fertility almost wholly from organic matter.\n\nEven well managed loess [[arable land|farmland]] can experience dramatic [[erosion]] of well over 2.5&nbsp;kg /m<sup>2</sup> per year.

Loess grains are [[Rounding (sediment)|angular]] with little polishing or rounding and composed of crystals of [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], [[mica]] and other [[mineral]]s. Loess can be described as a rich, dust-like soil.<ref>Pearson Prentice Hall - World Studies - Europe and Russia</ref>\n\nLoess deposits may become very thick, more than a hundred meters in areas of China and tens of meters in parts of the Midwestern United States. It generally occurs as a blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick.\n\nLoess often stands in either steep or vertical faces.<ref>Neuendorf, K.E.K., J.P. Mehl Jr., and J.A. Jackson, 2005, ''Glossary of Geology.'' [[Springer-Verlag]], [[New York City]], 779 pp., {{ISBN|3-540-27951-2}}</ref> Because the grains are angular, loess will often stand in banks for many years without [[Slump (geology)|slump]]ing. This soil has a characteristic called vertical cleavage which makes it easily excavated to form cave dwellings, a popular method of making [[yaodong|human habitations]] in some parts of China. Loess will erode very readily.\n\nIn several areas of the world, loess [[ridge]]s have formed that are aligned with the [[prevailing wind]]s during the last [[glacial maximum]].  These are called \"[[paha (landform)|paha]] ridges\" in America and \"greda ridges\" in [[Europe]].  The form of these loess [[dune]]s has been explained by a combination of wind and [[tundra]] conditions.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Loess'' comes from the German ''L\u00f6ss'' or ''L\u00f6\u00df'', and ultimately from [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] ''l\u00f6sch'' meaning ''drop'' as named by [[peasants]] and [[masonry|mason]]s along the [[Rhine|Rhine Valley]].{{clarify|reason=does not agree with referenced material in lead|date=December 2018}}\n\n==History of research==\nThe term \"L\u00f6\u00df\" was first described in Central Europe by [[Karl C\u00e4sar von Leonhard]] (1823\u20131824)<ref>Leonhard K.

During the autumn and winter, when melting of the icesheets and icecaps ceased, the flow of meltwater down these rivers either ceased or was greatly reduced. As a consequence, large parts of the formerly submerged and unvegetated floodplains of these braided rivers dried out and were exposed to the wind. Because these floodplains consist of sediment containing a high content of glacially ground flour-like [[silt]] and [[clay]], they were highly susceptible to winnowing of their silts and [[clay]]s by the wind. Once entrained by the wind, particles were then deposited downwind.

The fine grains [[weathering|weather]] rapidly due to their large surface area, making soils derived from loess rich.  One theory states that the fertility of loess soils is due largely to [[cation exchange capacity]] (the ability of plants to absorb nutrients from the soil) and [[porosity]] (the air-filled space in the soil). The fertility of loess is not due to organic matter content, which tends to be rather low, unlike tropical soils which derive their fertility almost wholly from organic matter.\n\nEven well managed loess [[arable land|farmland]] can experience dramatic [[erosion]] of well over 2.5&nbsp;kg /m<sup>2</sup> per year. In China the [[Loess Plateau|loess deposits]] which give the [[Yellow River]] its color have been farmed and have produced phenomenal yields for over one thousand years. Winds pick up loess particles, contributing to the [[Asian Dust]] pollution problem. The largest deposit of loess in the United States, the [[Loess Hills]] along the border of [[Iowa]] and Nebraska, has survived intensive farming and [[Land degradation|poor farming practices]]. For almost 150 years, this loess deposit was farmed with [[mouldboard plough]]s and fall tilled, both intensely erosive. At times it suffered erosion rates of over 10 kilograms per square meter per year. Today this loess deposit is worked as low till or [[no till]] in all areas and is aggressively [[terrace (agriculture)|terraced]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Large areas of loess deposits and soils==\n===Argentina===\n[[File:ArgentinaLoess.JPG|right|thumb|An [[outcrop]] of loess in [[Patagonia]]]]\nMuch of Argentina is covered by loess.

Thank you. -->\nOn January 9, 1854 (a day after the anniversary of the [[Battle of New Orleans]]), a group of over 1,500 War of 1812 veterans from across the United States met in convention at the [[Congress Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], having responded to a call issued by [[Joel Barlow Sutherland|Joel B. Sutherland]] (1792-1861), a War of 1812 veteran and former Congressman from Philadelphia. Ostensibly called to draft resolutions pertaining to bounty land benefit legislation, the veterans assembled in Philadelphia acknowledged the need for an organization for mutual support and to perpetuate the history of the War of 1812. From this convention, the Society of the War of 1812 was founded and Sutherland was elected its first President. The Society met again in convention a year later in [[Washington, D.C.]], where they were received by President [[Franklin Pierce]] at the [[White House]] and lobbied members of [[34th United States Congress|Congress]] to secure the [[Land grant|bounty land]] legislation, which was passed later in 1855. Sutherland\u2019s goal was to form a division of the Society of the War of 1812 in each state in the [[United States|union]]. His vision for the organization was not completed at the time of his death in 1861. Shortly thereafter, the General Society of the War of 1812 began accepting sons and grandsons of Veteran members.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gswar1812.org/our-history/ |title=Our History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=General Society of the War of 1812 |access-date=October 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Notable members==\n*Major General [[Adolphus Greeley]]\n*Major General [[Joseph Wheeler]]\n*President [[Benjamin Harrison]]\n*Major General [[John R.

It would quickly become too unwieldy. Thank you. -->\nOn January 9, 1854 (a day after the anniversary of the [[Battle of New Orleans]]), a group of over 1,500 War of 1812 veterans from across the United States met in convention at the [[Congress Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], having responded to a call issued by [[Joel Barlow Sutherland|Joel B. Sutherland]] (1792-1861), a War of 1812 veteran and former Congressman from Philadelphia. Ostensibly called to draft resolutions pertaining to bounty land benefit legislation, the veterans assembled in Philadelphia acknowledged the need for an organization for mutual support and to perpetuate the history of the War of 1812. From this convention, the Society of the War of 1812 was founded and Sutherland was elected its first President. The Society met again in convention a year later in [[Washington, D.C.]], where they were received by President [[Franklin Pierce]] at the [[White House]] and lobbied members of [[34th United States Congress|Congress]] to secure the [[Land grant|bounty land]] legislation, which was passed later in 1855. Sutherland\u2019s goal was to form a division of the Society of the War of 1812 in each state in the [[United States|union]]. His vision for the organization was not completed at the time of his death in 1861. Shortly thereafter, the General Society of the War of 1812 began accepting sons and grandsons of Veteran members.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gswar1812.org/our-history/ |title=Our History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=General Society of the War of 1812 |access-date=October 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Notable members==\n*Major General [[Adolphus Greeley]]\n*Major General [[Joseph Wheeler]]\n*President [[Benjamin Harrison]]\n*Major General [[John R.
