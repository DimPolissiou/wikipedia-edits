Written by [[Bryan Woods]], [[Scott Beck]] and Krasinski, the plot revolves around a father (Krasinski) and a mother ([[Emily Blunt]]) who struggle to survive and raise their children in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] world inhabited by blind [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] creatures with an acute sense of hearing.\n\nBeck and Woods had begun developing a story that would lead into the film at college. In July 2016, Krasinski read their [[spec script]] and was hired to direct and rewrite the script in March the following year. The film drew inspiration from other films, such as ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'', and ''[[In the Bedroom]]''. Krasinski and Blunt were cast in the lead roles in May 2017. Filming took place in [[upstate New York]] from May to November 2017.\n\n''A Quiet Place'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 9, 2018, and was released in the United States on April 6, 2018, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It became a major box office success, grossing over $340 million worldwide, and received critical acclaim for its atmosphere, direction, acting, and sound design. It was described as a \"smart, wickedly frightening good time\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/a-quiet-place-and-blockers-are-certified-fresh/ |title='A Quiet Place' and 'Blockers' Are Certified Fresh |first=Jeff |last=Giles |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> and chosen by both the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] as one of the top ten films of 2018.\n\nThe film received several award nominations, including a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]], [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role]] for Blunt, which she later won. It was also nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Sound]] at the [[72nd British Academy Film Awards|72nd BAFTA Awards]] as well for a [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] at the [[91st Academy Awards]].\n\nA sequel, ''[[A Quiet Place Part II]]'', is scheduled to be released in 2020, with Krasinski again directing and the main cast also returning.\n\n==Plot==\nThroughout the year of 2020, most of Earth's human and animal populations have been annihilated by sightless extraterrestrial creatures. The creatures, which attack anything that makes noise, have hypersensitive hearing and indestructible, armored skin.\n\nThe Abbott family{{spnd}}wife Evelyn, husband Lee, congenitally deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau{{spnd}}silently scavenge for supplies in a deserted town. While out in the open, the family communicates with [[American Sign Language]]. Four-year-old Beau is drawn to a battery-powered space shuttle toy, but Lee takes it away due to the noise it would make. Regan returns the toy to Beau, who also takes the batteries that his father removed from it. Beau activates the toy when the family is walking home and crossing a bridge, giving away his location to a nearby creature that kills him before Lee can save him.\n\n[[File:House used as the Abbott family home in A Quiet Place.jpg|thumb|right|The house used as the Abbotts' in the film|alt=A white wooden three-story house with a scaled mansard roof, lit by the sun from the left, viewed at a three-quarters angle amid a landscape with wooded hills in the background under a clear blue sky]]\nOver a year later, Regan struggles with guilt over her brother's death, Evelyn enters the final stages of pregnancy, and Lee fruitlessly tries to make radio contact with the outside world. Lee attempts to upgrade Regan's [[cochlear implant]] with scavenged miniature amplifiers to restore her hearing, but the devices are ineffective. Later, Lee takes Marcus to a nearby river with a large waterfall to teach him to fish while Regan visits Beau's memorial. Lee explains to Marcus that they are safe from the creatures in the presence of louder and constant sounds, as the sounds mask over their voices and do not attract creatures. Marcus then reveals that Regan blames herself for Beau's death and needs her father to tell her he still loves her.\n\nAlone at the house, Evelyn goes into labor. While making her way to their basement, she steps on an exposed nail. In pain, she accidentally drops a glass picture frame and alerts a nearby creature. Evelyn flips a switch that changes the exterior house lights to red as a danger signal to the others and struggles to remain silent during her [[uterine contraction|contractions]].\n\nArriving at the farm and seeing the lights, Lee instructs Marcus to set off fireworks as a diversion. Arriving at the house, Lee finds Evelyn hiding in the bathroom with their newborn son and, along with Evelyn, makes his way to their improvised soundproofed basement. Lee leaves to find the other children, promising Evelyn he will protect them. Evelyn then falls asleep but soon wakes to discover that the barn basement is flooded with water from a broken pipe and that a creature has found its way inside the basement hideaway.\n\nRegan, hurrying back to the farm, takes refuge atop a [[grain silo]] with Marcus, lighting a fire to alert their father of their whereabouts. However, they run out of lighter fluid and the fire dies before they can attract Lee's attention. A hatch door then suddenly gives way, and Marcus falls into the silo. The sound of the door falling distracts the creature that was stalking Evelyn and it targets Marcus and Regan. Regan, who has jumped in after Marcus, [[grain entrapment|sinks into the corn and nearly suffocates]], but Marcus saves her. Regan's cochlear implant reacts to the proximity of the creature by emitting a high-frequency sound that drives it away. The children proceed to escape from the silo and reunite with their father.\n\nThe creature returns, attacking and wounding Lee, while Marcus and Regan hide in a pickup truck. After seeing his father wounded, Marcus shouts impulsively, attracting the creature to the truck. Lee signs to Regan that he loves her and always has, before yelling to draw the creature away from his children; the creature, hearing Lee's voice, attacks and kills him. Regan and Marcus roll the truck down a hill to escape and reunite with Evelyn and the baby at the farmhouse.\n\nThe four retreat to the house's basement.<ref name=METRO2 /> When the creature returns, Regan, who realizes that the sound made by the implant distresses the creature,<ref name=METRO2 /> switches the device back on and places it on a nearby microphone, amplifying the [[audio feedback|feedback]]. Painfully disoriented, the creature exposes the flesh beneath its armored head, allowing Evelyn to fatally shoot it with a [[shotgun]]. The family views a [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] monitor, showing two creatures attracted by the noise of the shotgun blast approaching the house. With their newly acquired knowledge of the creatures' weakness, the members of the family arm themselves and prepare to fight back.<ref name=METRO2>{{cite news |last=Wakeman |first=Gregory |url=https://www.metro.us/entertainment/movies/a-quiet-place-ending |title='A Quiet Place' has one of the coolest movie endings ever |work=[[Metro (U.S. newspaper)|Metro]] |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=July 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Krasinski]] as Lee Abbott, an engineer, husband of Evelyn, and the father of Regan, Marcus, Beau, and baby Abbott.

For scenes from the perspective of the deaf daughter, sound was removed to put greater focus on the visual. They also advised on organizing shots to reflect the creatures' perspective, like showing them noticing a sound, then showing what was causing the sound. Composer [[Marco Beltrami]] provided the sound editors music to work with in a way that would not interfere with the sound design throughout the film.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=James |first=Daron |url=https://variety.com/2018/artisans/production/quiet-place-sound-1202743919/ |title='A Quiet Place' Leans on Sound Team to Deliver Maximum Chills |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=April 6, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn the film, creatures are blind and communicate through clicking sounds. Aadahl and Van der Ryn said they were inspired by [[animal echolocation]], such as that employed by bats.

The director wanted the creatures to look like they had evolved to no longer need eyes, and to be \"somewhat humanoid\" in nature. Farrar said the initial creature design showed them with rhinoceros-like horns out of their faces, later redesigned. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' reported, \"The team immediately set about pulling references; prehistoric fish, black snakes, and bats, particularly their movement patterns.

Written by [[Bryan Woods]], [[Scott Beck]] and Krasinski, the plot revolves around a father (Krasinski) and a mother ([[Emily Blunt]]) who struggle to survive and raise their children in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] world inhabited by blind [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] creatures with an acute sense of hearing.\n\nBeck and Woods had begun developing a story that would lead into the film at college. In July 2016, Krasinski read their [[spec script]] and was hired to direct and rewrite the script in March the following year. The film drew inspiration from other films, such as ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'', and ''[[In the Bedroom]]''. Krasinski and Blunt were cast in the lead roles in May 2017. Filming took place in [[upstate New York]] from May to November 2017.\n\n''A Quiet Place'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 9, 2018, and was released in the United States on April 6, 2018, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It became a major box office success, grossing over $340 million worldwide, and received critical acclaim for its atmosphere, direction, acting, and sound design. It was described as a \"smart, wickedly frightening good time\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/a-quiet-place-and-blockers-are-certified-fresh/ |title='A Quiet Place' and 'Blockers' Are Certified Fresh |first=Jeff |last=Giles |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> and chosen by both the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] as one of the top ten films of 2018.\n\nThe film received several award nominations, including a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]], [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role]] for Blunt, which she later won. It was also nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Sound]] at the [[72nd British Academy Film Awards|72nd BAFTA Awards]] as well for a [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] at the [[91st Academy Awards]].\n\nA sequel, ''[[A Quiet Place Part II]]'', is scheduled to be released in 2020, with Krasinski again directing and the main cast also returning.\n\n==Plot==\nThroughout the year of 2020, most of Earth's human and animal populations have been annihilated by sightless extraterrestrial creatures. The creatures, which attack anything that makes noise, have hypersensitive hearing and indestructible, armored skin.\n\nThe Abbott family{{spnd}}wife Evelyn, husband Lee, congenitally deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau{{spnd}}silently scavenge for supplies in a deserted town. While out in the open, the family communicates with [[American Sign Language]]. Four-year-old Beau is drawn to a battery-powered space shuttle toy, but Lee takes it away due to the noise it would make. Regan returns the toy to Beau, who also takes the batteries that his father removed from it. Beau activates the toy when the family is walking home and crossing a bridge, giving away his location to a nearby creature that kills him before Lee can save him.\n\n[[File:House used as the Abbott family home in A Quiet Place.jpg|thumb|right|The house used as the Abbotts' in the film|alt=A white wooden three-story house with a scaled mansard roof, lit by the sun from the left, viewed at a three-quarters angle amid a landscape with wooded hills in the background under a clear blue sky]]\nOver a year later, Regan struggles with guilt over her brother's death, Evelyn enters the final stages of pregnancy, and Lee fruitlessly tries to make radio contact with the outside world. Lee attempts to upgrade Regan's [[cochlear implant]] with scavenged miniature amplifiers to restore her hearing, but the devices are ineffective. Later, Lee takes Marcus to a nearby river with a large waterfall to teach him to fish while Regan visits Beau's memorial. Lee explains to Marcus that they are safe from the creatures in the presence of louder and constant sounds, as the sounds mask over their voices and do not attract creatures. Marcus then reveals that Regan blames herself for Beau's death and needs her father to tell her he still loves her.\n\nAlone at the house, Evelyn goes into labor. While making her way to their basement, she steps on an exposed nail. In pain, she accidentally drops a glass picture frame and alerts a nearby creature. Evelyn flips a switch that changes the exterior house lights to red as a danger signal to the others and struggles to remain silent during her [[uterine contraction|contractions]].\n\nArriving at the farm and seeing the lights, Lee instructs Marcus to set off fireworks as a diversion. Arriving at the house, Lee finds Evelyn hiding in the bathroom with their newborn son and, along with Evelyn, makes his way to their improvised soundproofed basement. Lee leaves to find the other children, promising Evelyn he will protect them. Evelyn then falls asleep but soon wakes to discover that the barn basement is flooded with water from a broken pipe and that a creature has found its way inside the basement hideaway.\n\nRegan, hurrying back to the farm, takes refuge atop a [[grain silo]] with Marcus, lighting a fire to alert their father of their whereabouts. However, they run out of lighter fluid and the fire dies before they can attract Lee's attention. A hatch door then suddenly gives way, and Marcus falls into the silo. The sound of the door falling distracts the creature that was stalking Evelyn and it targets Marcus and Regan. Regan, who has jumped in after Marcus, [[grain entrapment|sinks into the corn and nearly suffocates]], but Marcus saves her. Regan's cochlear implant reacts to the proximity of the creature by emitting a high-frequency sound that drives it away. The children proceed to escape from the silo and reunite with their father.\n\nThe creature returns, attacking and wounding Lee, while Marcus and Regan hide in a pickup truck. After seeing his father wounded, Marcus shouts impulsively, attracting the creature to the truck.

In addition to considering his film a metaphor for parenthood, he compared the premise to US politics in 2018, \"I think in our political situation, that's what's going on now: You can close your eyes and stick your head in the sand, or you can try to participate in whatever's going on.\" He cited ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) as an influence, with how the protagonist police officer moved from New York to an island to avoid frightening situations, and was forced to encounter one in his new location with shark attacks.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Manning |first=Sean |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/playboy-interview-john-krasinski |title=The Playboy Interview: John Krasinski is Breaking Into Horror, and the World is Watching |magazine=[[Playboy]] |date=March 1, 2018 |accessdate=March 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308085622/http://www.playboy.com/articles/playboy-interview-john-krasinski |archive-date=March 8, 2018 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nMatthew Monagle of ''[[Film School Rejects]]'' said ''A Quiet Place'' seemed to be \"the early frontrunner for the sparsely intellectual horror movie of the year\", like previous films ''[[The Babadook]]'' (2014) and ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'' (2015). Monagle said Krasinski, who had directed two previous films, was \"making an unusual pivot into a genre typically reserved for newcomers\", and considered it to be part of a movement toward horror films layered \"in storytelling, [with] character beats not typically found in a horror movie\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Monagle |first=Matthew |url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/a-quiet-place-get-out/ |title=Does 'A Quiet Place' Prove Filmmakers Are Moving Towards, Not Away From, the Horror Genre? |website=[[Film School Rejects]] |date=March 6, 2018 |accessdate=March 6, 2018 }}</ref> Tatiana Tenreyro, writing for ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'', said while ''A Quiet Place'' was not a [[silent film]], \"It is the first of its kind within the modern horror genre for how little spoken dialogue it actually has.\" She said the rare moments of spoken dialogue \"give depth to this horror movie, showing how the narrative defies the genre's traditional films even further\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Tenreyro |first=Tatiana |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/is-a-quiet-place-a-silent-movie-the-horror-film-is-unlike-anything-youve-seen-8657554 |title=Is 'A Quiet Place' A Silent Movie?

He likened the family's primitive, agrarian life of silence to monasticism, and commends their self-giving love.

He described it as \"the antithesis of \u2018Get Out\u2019\" and \"both apparently unconscious and conspicuously regressive\" and opined that it \"[brings] to the fore the idealistic elements of gun culture while dramatizing the tragic implications that inevitably shadow that idealism.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Brody |first=Richard |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-silently-regressive-politics-of-a-quiet-place |title=The Silently Regressive Politics Of \"A Quiet Place\" |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=April 10, 2018 |accessdate=July 1, 2019 }}</ref> Krasinski addressed Brody's criticism in a subsequent interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', stating that he did not write the film with an intentional political message.
