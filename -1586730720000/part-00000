As a student of the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music|NSW Conservatorium of Music]], he studied piano with the noted pianist/composer [[Frank Hutchens]] (a pupil of [[Tobias Matthay]]), and composition with [[Raymond Hanson (composer)|Raymond Hanson]]. In Sydney, he performed on radio 2CH, gave recitals and taught before sailing for London in 1968.\n\nSince then, he has given a wide range of concerts, including the Wimbledon Summer Festival, Leighton House, and a much-publicised 1981 Royal Wedding Day concert at St. Martin-within-Ludgate.\n\nHe is one of the very few composer-pianists on the circuit today. In addition to a wide repertoire of neo-classical music and virtuoso Romantic music, he has established a considerable reputation with the performances of his own compositions, as well as his own poetry (Albion Enigma) and he has presented concerts of extemporised keyboard work.\nHe has worked with Ballet Rambert, the Royal Ballet, Arts Educational Schools and the mime artists [[Adam Darius]] and Nathaniel. He was also Musical Director of the International Arts Centre\u2014participating in an American production (Pantomime) of ''Hansel and Gretel''.\n\n[[Image:John-Boswell-Maver.jpg|thumb|right|John Boswell Maver.]]\n\nMaver returned to Australia for two years' sojourn, where he continued to give recitals, most notably for the Polish-Australian Cultural Society (which was filmed) and performances at the Sydney Opera House with the Australian Ballet and the English dancer Maina Gielgud for a television film ''Frozen Music'' He also appeared in the ''Sydney Spectacular'' for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. At the same time he made himself known as an actor\u2014appearing in TV. Series, commercials, and feature films\u2014chief among which have been ''Bodyline'', ''The Last Bastion'' playing opposite Timothy West, ''Land of Hope'', and ''Burke and Wills''-in the role of conductor (an operatic sequence with Greta Scacchi).\n\nReturning to Britain in 1986, Maver resumed his career with a performance of his ''Toccata Australis'', a substantial work which has been well praised by many international pianists including [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Nelson Freire]], and [[Shura Cherkassky]]. This work was first performed in Britain by Alan Brown. The American virtuoso pianist Janice Weber has praised several of Maver's compositions as \"Very Horowitzian\"; an \u00c9tude for the Left Hand Alone as \"Very effective. Sounds as difficult as it is.\"  He has recorded a programme of Bach, [[Beethoven]], [[Chopin]] and [[Franz Liszt]], in addition to his own compositions and extemporisations.\n\nAn unpublished novel has been completed, he has established himself as a photographer in the casual style and has exhibited a collection of photos charting the rebuilding of part of the Arts Educational Schools (theatre) in Chiswick.  Recently a London photo agency has accepted some of his photographic work to be included in their catalogue.

As a student of the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music|NSW Conservatorium of Music]], he studied piano with the noted pianist/composer [[Frank Hutchens]] (a pupil of [[Tobias Matthay]]), and composition with [[Raymond Hanson (composer)|Raymond Hanson]]. In Sydney, he performed on radio 2CH, gave recitals and taught before sailing for London in 1968.\n\nSince then, he has given a wide range of concerts, including the Wimbledon Summer Festival, Leighton House, and a much-publicised 1981 Royal Wedding Day concert at St. Martin-within-Ludgate.\n\nHe is one of the very few composer-pianists on the circuit today. In addition to a wide repertoire of neo-classical music and virtuoso Romantic music, he has established a considerable reputation with the performances of his own compositions, as well as his own poetry (Albion Enigma) and he has presented concerts of extemporised keyboard work.\nHe has worked with Ballet Rambert, the Royal Ballet, Arts Educational Schools and the mime artists [[Adam Darius]] and Nathaniel. He was also Musical Director of the International Arts Centre\u2014participating in an American production (Pantomime) of ''Hansel and Gretel''.\n\n[[Image:John-Boswell-Maver.jpg|thumb|right|John Boswell Maver.]]\n\nMaver returned to Australia for two years' sojourn, where he continued to give recitals, most notably for the Polish-Australian Cultural Society (which was filmed) and performances at the Sydney Opera House with the Australian Ballet and the English dancer Maina Gielgud for a television film ''Frozen Music'' He also appeared in the ''Sydney Spectacular'' for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. At the same time he made himself known as an actor\u2014appearing in TV. Series, commercials, and feature films\u2014chief among which have been ''Bodyline'', ''The Last Bastion'' playing opposite Timothy West, ''Land of Hope'', and ''Burke and Wills''-in the role of conductor (an operatic sequence with Greta Scacchi).\n\nReturning to Britain in 1986, Maver resumed his career with a performance of his ''Toccata Australis'', a substantial work which has been well praised by many international pianists including [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Nelson Freire]], and [[Shura Cherkassky]]. This work was first performed in Britain by Alan Brown. The American virtuoso pianist Janice Weber has praised several of Maver's compositions as \"Very Horowitzian\"; an \u00c9tude for the Left Hand Alone as \"Very effective. Sounds as difficult as it is.\"  He has recorded a programme of Bach, [[Beethoven]], [[Chopin]] and [[Franz Liszt]], in addition to his own compositions and extemporisations.\n\nAn unpublished novel has been completed, he has established himself as a photographer in the casual style and has exhibited a collection of photos charting the rebuilding of part of the Arts Educational Schools (theatre) in Chiswick.  Recently a London photo agency has accepted some of his photographic work to be included in their catalogue.

His grandfather [[Elisha Dyer]] had served as governor of Rhode Island, and his father was to serve as governor from 1897 to 1900.

In 1893 he was promoted to first lieutenant and then to captain. In 1898 he became a major and in 1899, after service in the [[Spanish-American War]], colonel and commander of the 12th Regiment (later to become the [[212th Coast Artillery (United States)|212th Coast Artillery]]).\n\nOn February 28, 1912 he was commissioned brigadier general in charge of the 87th Infantry Brigade. Dyer commanded troops on the Mexican border in 1916, stationed at [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]], [[Texas]].

The most serious construction problem turned out to be ventilating the tunnel, and Dyer as chairman backed the solution advanced by engineer [[Ole Singstad]] of ventilating the tunnels transversely. After testing Singstad's method was adopted, and construction began in the spring of 1922. After many delays, the tunnel was opened November 12, 1927.\n\nIn 1930 the Holland Tunnel was transferred to the [[Port of New York Authority]] and Dyer was made a member of the Port Authority board.

In all more than 900 of these engines were produced, in the 1930s and through most of [[World War II]].\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Jumo 207 im Technikmuseum Hugo Junkers Dessau 2010-08-06 01.jpg|thumb|left|A similarly sectioned Junkers Jumo 207 aviation Diesel engine]]\nThese engines all used a [[two-stroke cycle]] with twelve pistons sharing six cylinders, piston crown to piston crown in an [[opposed piston]] configuration. This unusual configuration required two crankshafts, one at the bottom of the cylinder block and the other at the top, geared together. The pistons moved towards each other during the operating cycle. Intake and exhaust manifolds were duplicated on both sides of the block. There were two cam-operated injection pumps per cylinder, each feeding two nozzles, for 4 nozzles per cylinder in all.\n\nAs is typical of two-stroke designs, the Jumos used no valves, but rather fixed intake and exhaust port apertures cut into the cylinder liners during their manufacture, which were uncovered when the pistons reached a certain point in their stroke. Normally such designs have poor [[volumetric efficiency]] because both ports open and close at the same time and are generally located across from each other in the cylinder. This leads to poor scavenging of the burnt charge, which is why valve-less two-strokes generally produce smoke and are inefficient.\n\nThe Jumo solved this problem to a very large degree through clever arrangement of the ports. The intake port was located under the \"lower\" piston, while the exhaust port was under the \"upper\". The lower crankshaft ran eleven degrees behind the upper, meaning that the exhaust ports opened and, even more importantly, closed first, allowing proper scavenging. This system made the two-stroke Jumos run as cleanly and almost as efficiently as four-stroke engines using valves, but with considerably less complexity.\n\nThere is some downside to this system as well. For one, since matching pistons were not closing at quite the same time, but one ran \"ahead\" of the other, the engine could not run as smoothly as a true opposed style engine. In addition, the power from the two opposing crankshafts had to be geared together, adding weight and complexity, a problem the design shared with [[H engine|H block]] engines.\n\nIn the Jumo, these problems were avoided to some degree by taking power primarily from the \"upper\" shaft, somewhat offset upwards on the engine's front end. All of the accessories, such as fuel pumps, injectors and the [[scavenging (automotive)|scavenging]] compressor, were run from the lower shaft, meaning over half of its power was already used up. What was left over was then geared to the upper shaft, which ran the engine's propeller. In all, about three-quarters of the power to the engine's propeller came from the upper crankshaft.{{dubious|date=October 2013}}\n\nIn theory, the flat layout of the engine could have allowed it to be installed inside the thick wings of larger aircraft, such as [[airliner]]s and [[bomber]]s. Details of the oil scavenging system suggest this was not possible and the engine had to be run \"vertically\", as it was on all designs using it.\n\n==Variants==\n;Jumo 205:\n;Jumo 206:\n;Jumo 207: High altitude version  with two inline centrifugal superchargers and a precooler.

It can be safely assumed that, due to under-reporting, the real figure is substantially higher: conservative estimates place it at up to ten times higher. Statistics from the [http://dpr.gov.ng Department of Petroleum Resources] indicate that between 1976 and 1996 a total of 4,835 incidents resulted in the spillage of at least 2,446,322 barrels (102.7 million U.S. gallons), of which an estimated 1,896,930 barrels (79.7 million U.S. gallons; 77 percent) were lost to the environment. Another calculation, based on oil industry sources, estimates that more than 1.07 million barrels (45 million U.S. gallons) of oil were spilled in Nigeria from 1960 to 1997. Nigeria's largest spill was an offshore well [[blowout (well drilling)]] in January 1980, when at least 200,000 barrels of oil (8.4 million U.S. gallons), according to oil industry sources, spewed into the Atlantic Ocean from a Texaco facility and destroyed 340 hectares of mangroves.

The result of such unchecked environmental pollution and degradation are that (i) The Ogoni can no longer farm successfully. Once the food basket of the eastern Niger Delta, the Ogoni now buy food (when they can't afford it); (ii) Fish, once a common source of protein, is now rare.

If the companies failed to comply, the Ogonis threatened to embark on mass action to disrupt their operations. By this act, the Ogonis shifted the focus of their actions from an unresponsive federal government to oil companies actively engaged in their own region. The bases for this assignment of responsibility were the vast profits accrued by the oil companies from extracting the natural wealth of the Ogoni homeland, none of which were trickling down to the Ogoni.<ref name=\"Niger Delta Affairs\">{{cite web |url=http://nigerdeltaaffairs.org/index.php/ogoni-bill-of-rights |title=Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People |website=nigerdeltaaffairs.org |accessdate=December 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221034430/http://nigerdeltaaffairs.org/index.php/ogoni-bill-of-rights |archive-date=December 21, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n'''1993'''\n* January 4 \u2013 The national government responded by banning public gatherings and declaring that disturbances of oil production were acts of treason. In spite of the ban, MOSOP went ahead with a massive public mobilization on January 4, 1993. The event, called the first Ogoni Day, attracted about 300,000 people in massive festivities. Over the next month as the mobilization continued, one Shell employee (out of thousands) was beaten by an Ogoni mob. As a security measure, [[Shell Petroleum Development Company]] withdrew its employees from Ogoniland. This action had very mixed consequences. Oil extraction from the territory has slowed to a trickle of {{convert|10000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} (.5% of the national total).
