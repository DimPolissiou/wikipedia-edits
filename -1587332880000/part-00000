Despite this, the combined per capita crime rate of the 33rd and 34th precincts was lower than that of the Harlem precincts in 2019, with significantly lower rates of murder (50.5%), rape (49.2%), felony assault (39.2%), and robbery (37%), in addition to slightly lower rates of burglary (8.7%) and grand larceny (5.8%); the one exception was motor vehicle theft, which was 13.6% higher in the Washington Heights precincts.<ref name=\"crime map\"/><ref name=\"NYPD 30th Precinct CS\">{{cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-030pct.pdf|title=30th Precinct CompStat Report|date=|format=PDF|publisher=[[New York City Police Department]]|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"NYPD 32nd Precinct CS\">{{cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-032pct.pdf|title=32nd Precinct CompStat Report|date=|format=PDF|publisher=[[New York City Police Department]]|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe crime drop, which was felt across all major cities, owed itself largely to the decrease in new users and dealers of crack cocaine, and the move of existing dealers from dealing on the streets to dealing from inside apartments.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/17/nyregion/where-has-your-neighborhood-drug-dealer-gone.html|title=Where Has Your Neighborhood Drug Dealer Gone?|last=Rohde|first=David|date=August 17, 1997|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 17, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/19/us/crack-s-legacy-a-special-report-a-drug-ran-its-course-then-hid-with-its-users.html|first=Timothy|last=Egan|accessdate=April 17, 2020|date=September 19, 1999|title=CRACK'S LEGACY: A special report; A Drug Ran Its Course, Then Hid With Its Users|work=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In Washington Heights, this meant a move back to the established cocaine dealing culture that had existed before the introduction of crack.

auction, trading players with other teams during the trading windows, and signing replacements for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction and also set their base price, and are bought by the franchise that bids the highest for them. Unsold players at the auction are eligible to be signed up as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a player can only be traded with his consent, with the franchise paying the difference if any between the old and new contracts. If the new contract is worth more than the older one, the difference is shared between the player and the franchise selling the player. There are generally three trading windows{{mdash}}two before the auction and one after the auction but before the start of the tournament. Players cannot be traded outside the trading windows or during the tournament, whereas replacements can be signed before or during the tournament.\n\nSome of the team composition rules (as of 2020 season) are as follows:\n*The squad strength must be between 18 and 25 players, with a maximum of 8 overseas players.\n*[[Salary cap]] of the entire squad must not exceed {{INRConvert|850|m}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kolkata to host IPL 2020 auction on December 19|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/kolkata-to-host-ipl-2020-auction-on-december-19/articleshow/71386522.cms|accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n*Under-19 players cannot be picked unless they have previously played [[first-class cricket|first-class]] or [[List A cricket|List A]] cricket.\n*A team can play a maximum of 4 overseas players in their playing eleven.<ref>{{cite web|title=Instances in IPL when team played less than 4 overseas players|url=https://www.crictracker.com/instances-ipl-team-played-less-4-overseas-players/|accessdate=20 February 2019|work=CricTracker|date=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe term of a player contract is one year, with the franchise having the option to extend the contract by one or two years. Since the 2014 season, the player contracts are denominated in the [[Indian rupee]], before which the contracts were in [[U.S. dollar]]s. Overseas players can be remunerated in the currency of the player's choice at the [[exchange rate]] on either the contract due date or the actual date of payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Player regulations for IPL 2014|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2014/content/story/703647.html|date=24 December 2013|work=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref> Prior to the 2014 season, Indian domestic players were not included in the player auction pool and could be signed up by the franchises at a discrete amount while a fixed sum of {{INRConvert|1|m}} to {{INRConvert|3|m}} would get deducted per signing from the franchise's salary purse.

2016}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\n\n===Tournament format===\nCurrently, with eight teams, each team plays each other twice in a home-and-away [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format in the league phase. At the conclusion of the league stage, the top four teams will qualify for the playoffs. The top two teams from the league phase will play against each other in the first Qualifying match, with the winner going straight to the IPL final and the loser getting another chance to qualify for the IPL final by playing the second Qualifying match. Meanwhile, the third and fourth place teams from league phase play against each other in an eliminator match and the winner from that match will play the loser from the first Qualifying match. The winner of the second Qualifying match will move onto the final to play the winner of the first Qualifying match in the IPL Final match, where the winner will be crowned the Indian Premier League champions.\n\n===Player acquisition, squad composition and salaries===\nA team can acquire players through any of the three ways: the annual player auction, trading players with other teams during the trading windows, and signing replacements for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction and also set their base price, and are bought by the franchise that bids the highest for them. Unsold players at the auction are eligible to be signed up as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a player can only be traded with his consent, with the franchise paying the difference if any between the old and new contracts. If the new contract is worth more than the older one, the difference is shared between the player and the franchise selling the player. There are generally three trading windows{{mdash}}two before the auction and one after the auction but before the start of the tournament. Players cannot be traded outside the trading windows or during the tournament, whereas replacements can be signed before or during the tournament.\n\nSome of the team composition rules (as of 2020 season) are as follows:\n*The squad strength must be between 18 and 25 players, with a maximum of 8 overseas players.\n*[[Salary cap]] of the entire squad must not exceed {{INRConvert|850|m}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kolkata to host IPL 2020 auction on December 19|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/kolkata-to-host-ipl-2020-auction-on-december-19/articleshow/71386522.cms|accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n*Under-19 players cannot be picked unless they have previously played [[first-class cricket|first-class]] or [[List A cricket|List A]] cricket.\n*A team can play a maximum of 4 overseas players in their playing eleven.<ref>{{cite web|title=Instances in IPL when team played less than 4 overseas players|url=https://www.crictracker.com/instances-ipl-team-played-less-4-overseas-players/|accessdate=20 February 2019|work=CricTracker|date=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe term of a player contract is one year, with the franchise having the option to extend the contract by one or two years. Since the 2014 season, the player contracts are denominated in the [[Indian rupee]], before which the contracts were in [[U.S. dollar]]s. Overseas players can be remunerated in the currency of the player's choice at the [[exchange rate]] on either the contract due date or the actual date of payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Player regulations for IPL 2014|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2014/content/story/703647.html|date=24 December 2013|work=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref> Prior to the 2014 season, Indian domestic players were not included in the player auction pool and could be signed up by the franchises at a discrete amount while a fixed sum of {{INRConvert|1|m}} to {{INRConvert|3|m}} would get deducted per signing from the franchise's salary purse. This received significant opposition from franchise owners who complained that richer franchises were \"luring players with under-the-table deals\" following which the IPL decided to include domestic players in the player auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2014/content/story/714115.html|title=IPL longlist features 651 uncapped players|date=30 January 2014|work=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey by Sporting Intelligence and ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'', the average IPL salary when [[pro rata|pro-rated]] is {{USD}}4.33 million per year, the second highest among all sports leagues in the world.

However, a penalty may be imposed if the [[Umpire (cricket)|umpires]] find teams misusing this privilege.

Temco's failure to secure a [[United States Air Force]] order for the Buckaroo forced it to turn to non-U.S. governments to keep the production lines going, yet only a few [[export]] orders materialized.\n\n==Design and development==\nEarly in 1948, Temco's president, Robert McCulloch, received an inquiry from the [[Philippine Government]] expressing an interest in a tandem trainer version of the Swift. The first '''TE-1A''' was a modification of the [[Globe Swift|Swift GC-1B]], hand-built to rough layout drawings, the major difference in appearance being the tandem seating arrangement which resulted in a narrow [[windshield]] and an elongated two-piece [[aircraft canopy|canopy]] with a fixed bubble at the rear. This TE-1A prototype was completed late in 1948. After initial flight tests a 145-hp Continental engine replaced the original 125-hp installation.\n\nEarly in 1949, Temco's management received word that the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) planned to hold a competition for a new primary/basic trainer. Temco built two additional [[prototype]]s for this competition, adding some minor improvements as time permitted. The three aircraft were designated the '''YT-35''' by the Air Force. Temco was competing with two other training aircraft, namely the [[Fairchild XNQ|Fairchild XNQ-1/T-31]] and the [[T-34 Mentor|Beechcraft Model 45]]. On 24 February 1949, the Air Force trainer evaluation board chose the Beech Model 45 by a four-to-one vote with Temco's TE-1A a distant third. Due to budget cuts, the USAF program was ultimately cancelled that year.<ref name=\"Dorr p. 835\"/>\n\nAlthough the USAF had decided against the TE-1A, interest had increased on the part of foreign governments, particularly the [[Philippines|Republic of the Philippines]]. After a study of the competition evaluation, Temco decided to proceed with a program to improve the TE-1A. Some of the redesign included: \n# A three-inch increase in the overall length of fuselage and a change in its cross section to be more compatible with the tandem seating. \n# The horizontal tail was raised nine inches. \n# Wing and fuselage fillets were added. \n# Improved landing gear with main gear relocation to improve ground handling characteristics. \n# Structural improvement in the wing to meet 9 G loading. \n# Equipment and equipment installation changes were made including a change from a 12-volt to a 24-volt electrical system and radio installation changes to meet Air Force standards.\n\nConcurrent with all this redesign, Temco had decided to build, on speculation, 10 of these production models powered by 145-hp engines.\n\n==Operational history==\nLate in 1949 with the engineering and tooling about 75% complete, three of the TE-1As redesigned '''YT-35''' were entered in the revived USAF trainer competition commencing in 1950.<ref name=\"Dorr p. 835\">Dorr 1991, p. 835.</ref> An evaluation program using students flying competing aircraft would be held at [[Randolph Air Force Base]]. Following receipt of the USAF order, Temco decided that in addition to the extensive changes that had been made to the TE-1A, a 165-hp Franklin engine would be installed. The USAF agreed to the change, with this model designated the '''TE-1B''' and given the name \u201cBuckaroo\u201d. Development of the TE-1A and the TE-1B continued concurrently. The TE-1A was designated for export, and the TE-1B was for the USAF. One TE-1A was bought by the [[Israeli Air Force]] and a second one was bought by the [[Hellenic Air Force|Greek Air Force]].<ref name=\"Dorr p. 835\"/>\n\nIn July 1950, the three '''YT-35''' Buckaroos were delivered to Randolph AFB to compete with the [[T-34 Mentor|YT-34 Mentor]], the [[Fairchild XNQ|Fairchild T-31]], [[Boulton Paul Balliol]], and the [[de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk|de Havilland DHC-1B Chipmunk]] trainers. Later in 1950, the [[Korean War]] disrupted many U.S. military programs, including the YT-35 evaluation. The aircraft ended up at James Connally Air Force Base, now called [[TSTC Waco Airport]] near [[Waco, Texas]].\n\n[[File:T-35A.jpg|thumb|right|1950 Temco T-35A, ''N904B'' (Manufacturer's Serial number: 6005) is privately owned.]]\n\nAfter 10 months of rigorous testing, the three YT-35s were returned to Temco in late July 1951, for factory overhaul. They then were assigned to [[Goodfellow Air Force Base]] where later all three were sold as surplus.\n\nThe majority of the TE-1Bs were sold to [[Saudi Arabia]] (designated '''T-35A''') through the USAF under the [[Mutual Defense Aid Program]]. Temco's contract with the Saudis called for ten T-35A aircraft and enough spares to keep them flying for years. The Saudi Arabian T-35A aircraft included two 30-caliber [[machine gun]]s, one mounted inside each wing and ten 2.75-inch [[rocket]]s, five mounted under each [[wing]].\n\nBoth [[Italy]] and [[Israel]] bought a single TE-1B Buckaroo in 1948.<ref name=\"Dorr p. 835\"/> In 1950, the Israeli aircraft was evaluated against the [[Fokker S-11|Fokker Instructor]] and the [[DHC-1 Chipmunk]] for possible use as a trainer with the IAF [[flight school]]. Losing the competition, the single Buckaroo was retired in late 1950 or early 1951.\n\n==Variants==\n;'''Model TE-1A'''\n:Company designation for the [[Franklin 6A4-165-B3]] engined version, six built (including three as YT-35).\n;'''Model TE-1B'''\n:Company designation for the [[Continental C-145|Continental C-145-2H]] engined version, ten built as the T-35A.\n;'''YT-35'''\n:Model TE-1A with [[Franklin 6A4-165-B3]] engine for evaluation by the [[United States Air Force]], three built.\n;'''T-35A'''\n:Model TE-1B delivered to Saudi Arabia under [[Mutual Defense Aid Program]], ten built.\n\n==Operators==\n;{{GRE}}\n*[[Greek Air Force]] \u2013 One aircraft only.<ref>''Air-Britain Aviation World'' Spring 2018, pp. 36\u201337.</ref>\n;{{ISR}}\n*[[Israeli Air Force]] \u2013 One TE-1A for evaluation<ref name=\"andrade167\">Andrade 1979, p. 167</ref>\n;{{ITA}}\n*[[Italian Air Force]] \u2013 One TE-1A only received in 1950<ref name=\"andrade167\" />\n;{{flag|Saudi Arabia}}\n*[[Royal Saudi Air Force]] \u2013 Ten T-35A<ref name=\"andrade167\" />\n;{{USA}}\n*[[United States Air Force]] \u2013 Three YT-35s for evaluation<ref name=\"andrade167\" />\n\n==Survivors==\nOne T-35A is on display in [[Riyadh]], Saudi Arabia.

His [[Capital punishment in the United States|execution]] was carried out in a considerably shorter time than most inmates awaiting the death penalty, as most convicts on death row in the United States spend an average of 15 years there. [[Terry Nichols]] and [[Michael and Lori Fortier|Michael Fortier]] were also convicted as conspirators in the plot.

Particularly, the government's use of [[CS gas]] on women and children angered McVeigh; he had been exposed to the gas as part of his military training and was familiar with its effects.

Thousands more took hours, days, weeks or months to die).\n\nIf Saddam is such a demon, and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation, why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of \"mass destruction\" \u2014 like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above?\n\nThe truth is, the U.S. has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction.}}\n\nThe essay, which marked the first time that McVeigh publicly discussed the Oklahoma City bombing, continued:\n\n{{quote|Hypocrisy when it comes to the death of children? In Oklahoma City, it was family convenience that explained the presence of a day-care center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building. Yet, when discussion shifts to Iraq, any day-care center in a government building instantly becomes \"a shield.\" Think about it.\n\nWhen considering morality and \"mens rea\" [criminal intent], in light of these facts, I ask: Who are the true barbarians? ...\n\nI find it ironic, to say the least, that one of the aircraft used to drop such a bomb on Iraq is dubbed \"The Spirit of Oklahoma.\" This leads me to a final, and unspoken, moral hypocrisy regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWhen a U.S. plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people, this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise. What a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake.\n\nUnfortunately, the morality of killing is not so superficial. The truth is, the use of a truck, a plane or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself.\n\nThese are weapons of mass destruction \u2014 and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons.\n\nWhether you wish to admit it or not, when you approve, morally, of the bombing of foreign targets by the U.S. military, you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in Oklahoma City ...}}\n\nMcVeigh included photocopies of a famous Vietnam War-era picture showing terrified children fleeing napalm bombs, and of nuclear devastation in Japan.

The handwritten essay, submitted to and published by the alternative national news magazine ''Media Bypass'', was distributed worldwide by the [[Associated Press]] on May 29, 1998. This was written in the midst of the 1998 [[Iraq disarmament timeline 1990\u20132003|Iraq disarmament crisis]] and a few months before [[Bombing of Iraq (1998)|Operation Desert Fox]].\n\n{{quote|The administration has said that [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq]] has no right to stockpile chemical or biological weapons (\"[[weapons of mass destruction]]\") \u2014 mainly because they have used them in the past.\n\nWell, if that's the standard by which these matters are decided, then the U.S. is the nation that set the precedent. The U.S. has stockpiled these same weapons (and more) for over 40 years. The U.S. claims this was done for deterrent purposes during its \"[[Cold War]]\" with the Soviet Union. Why, then, it is invalid for Iraq to claim the same reason (deterrence) with respect to Iraq's (real) war with, and the continued threat of, its neighbor Iran?\n\nThe administration claims that Iraq has used these weapons in the past. We've all seen the pictures that show a Kurdish woman and child frozen in death from the use of chemical weapons. But, have you ever seen those pictures juxtaposed next to pictures from Hiroshima or Nagasaki?\n\nI suggest that one study the histories of [[World War I]], [[World War II]] and other \"regional conflicts\" that the U.S. has been involved in to familiarize themselves with the use of \"weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nRemember [[Firebombing of Dresden|Dresden]]? How about [[Operation Linebacker II|Hanoi]]? [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Tripoli]]? [[Gulf War|Baghdad]]? What about the big ones \u2014 [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]? (At these two locations, the U.S. killed at least 150,000 non-combatants \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 in the blink of an eye. Thousands more took hours, days, weeks or months to die).\n\nIf Saddam is such a demon, and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation, why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of \"mass destruction\" \u2014 like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above?\n\nThe truth is, the U.S. has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction.}}\n\nThe essay, which marked the first time that McVeigh publicly discussed the Oklahoma City bombing, continued:\n\n{{quote|Hypocrisy when it comes to the death of children? In Oklahoma City, it was family convenience that explained the presence of a day-care center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building. Yet, when discussion shifts to Iraq, any day-care center in a government building instantly becomes \"a shield.\" Think about it.\n\nWhen considering morality and \"mens rea\" [criminal intent], in light of these facts, I ask: Who are the true barbarians? ...\n\nI find it ironic, to say the least, that one of the aircraft used to drop such a bomb on Iraq is dubbed \"The Spirit of Oklahoma.\" This leads me to a final, and unspoken, moral hypocrisy regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWhen a U.S. plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people, this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise. What a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake.\n\nUnfortunately, the morality of killing is not so superficial. The truth is, the use of a truck, a plane or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself.\n\nThese are weapons of mass destruction \u2014 and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons.\n\nWhether you wish to admit it or not, when you approve, morally, of the bombing of foreign targets by the U.S. military, you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in Oklahoma City ...}}\n\nMcVeigh included photocopies of a famous Vietnam War-era picture showing terrified children fleeing napalm bombs, and of nuclear devastation in Japan.

Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of
