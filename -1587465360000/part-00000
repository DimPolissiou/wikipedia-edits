It was the culmination of the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. England won the final by four [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|wickets]], clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England. It was the second time that the two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup \u2013 England won their previous final contest in 1993.\n\nBoth teams were unbeaten in the first group stage. In the second, known as the Super Sixes, New Zealand and England finished first and second to qualify directly for the final; New Zealand had only lost to England, while England had already guaranteed their place in the final when they lost their last match to Australia. England were considered the favourites for the final. The New Zealand [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], [[Haidee Tiffen]], won the [[Toss (cricket)|toss]], and opted to [[Batting (cricket)|bat]] first. Her side were [[bowled out]] for 166 [[Run (cricket)|runs]]. The [[all-rounder]] [[Lucy Doolan]], batting at [[Batting order (cricket)|number nine]], was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. [[Nicky Shaw]], one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]] to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named [[Player of the Match awards (cricket)|player of the match]] having replaced the injured [[Jenny Gunn]] just minutes before the game started.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], and the first to be organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802230336/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |title=Women's Cricket |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2 August 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>{{efn|The ICC took over administration of the women's game in 2005, when it merged with the [[International Women's Cricket Council]] (IWCC).<ref>{{cite book |title=Routledge Handbook of Global Sport |editor1-last=Nauright |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Zipp |editor2-first=Sarah |year=2020 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |p=202 |isbn=978-1-138-88723-7}}</ref>}} The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Skirting the Boundary: A History of Women's Cricket |last=Duncan |first=Isabelle |year=2013 |publisher=[[The Robson Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84954-546-4 |page=139}}</ref> The 2009 tournament included eight teams;

[[New Zealand women's national cricket team]], played on 22 March 2009 at the [[North Sydney Oval]] in Australia. It was the culmination of the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. England won the final by four [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|wickets]], clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England. It was the second time that the two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup \u2013 England won their previous final contest in 1993.\n\nBoth teams were unbeaten in the first group stage. In the second, known as the Super Sixes, New Zealand and England finished first and second to qualify directly for the final; New Zealand had only lost to England, while England had already guaranteed their place in the final when they lost their last match to Australia. England were considered the favourites for the final. The New Zealand [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], [[Haidee Tiffen]], won the [[Toss (cricket)|toss]], and opted to [[Batting (cricket)|bat]] first. Her side were [[bowled out]] for 166 [[Run (cricket)|runs]]. The [[all-rounder]] [[Lucy Doolan]], batting at [[Batting order (cricket)|number nine]], was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. [[Nicky Shaw]], one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]] to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named [[Player of the Match awards (cricket)|player of the match]] having replaced the injured [[Jenny Gunn]] just minutes before the game started.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], and the first to be organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802230336/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |title=Women's Cricket |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2 August 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>{{efn|The ICC took over administration of the women's game in 2005, when it merged with the [[International Women's Cricket Council]] (IWCC).<ref>{{cite book |title=Routledge Handbook of Global Sport |editor1-last=Nauright |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Zipp |editor2-first=Sarah |year=2020 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |p=202 |isbn=978-1-138-88723-7}}</ref>}} The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Skirting the Boundary: A History of Women's Cricket |last=Duncan |first=Isabelle |year=2013 |publisher=[[The Robson Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84954-546-4 |page=139}}</ref> The 2009 tournament included eight teams;

However, most of the legislators joined the [[Democratic Party of Japan (1996\u201398)|Democratic Party of Japan]] after that. Five leftist legislators who did not join the SDP formed the [[New Socialist Party (Japan)|New Socialist Party]] which lost all its seats in the following elections. The SDP enjoyed a short period of government participation from 1993 to 1994 as part of the [[Morihiro Hosokawa#Cabinet|Hosokawa cabinet]] and later formed a coalition government with the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) under 81st [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Tomiichi Murayama]] of the JSP from 1994 to January 1996. The SDP was part of ruling coalitions between January and November 1996 (first [[Ryutaro Hashimoto|Hashimoto]] cabinet) and from 2009 to 2010 ([[Yukio Hatoyama#Cabinet|Hatoyama cabinet]]).\n\nAfter the [[2019 Japanese House of Councillors election|2019 House of Councillors election]], it has four representatives in the national Diet, two in the lower house and two in the upper house.\n\n[[File:Social Democratic Party of Japan - campaginvan - dec13-2012.jpg|thumb|A SDPJ campaign van outside a station in December 2012]]\n\n== History ==\n===Before 2000===\n{{main|Japan Socialist Party}}\nIn January 1996, the New Socialist Party split off, Murayama resigned as Prime Minister and the JSP changed its name from the JSP to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as an interim party for forming a new party. However, a movement for transforming the SDP into a new social-democratic and liberal party was unsuccessful. Under Murayama's successor [[Ry\u016btar\u014d Hashimoto]] (LDP), the SDP remained part of the ruling coalition. Long before the disappointing result in the [[1996 Japanese general election|1996 general election]], the party lost the majority of its members of the House of Representatives, mainly to predecessors of the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1996)|Democratic Party of Japan]] (DPJ) that was formed in 1996, but also some to the NFP and other opposition parties. After its electoral defeat in the 1996 general election when it lost another 15 of its remaining 30 seats in the lower house, the SDP left the ruling coalition which it had entered as the second largest force in Japanese politics as a minor party.\n\n=== 2000s\u20132010s ===\nThe SDP won six seats in the [[2003 Japanese general election|2003 general election]], compared with 18 seats in the previous [[2000 Japanese general election|2000 general election]]. Its motives against the Self-Defense Forces have reverted into abolishing it in the long term, returning into its opposition against the force it had applied in the 1950s.\n\nDoi had been the leader since 1996, but she resigned in 2003, taking responsibility for the election losses. [[Mizuho Fukushima]] was elected as the new party leader in November 2003. In the [[2004 Japanese House of Councillors election|2004 House of Councillors elections]], the SDP won only two seats, having five seats in the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]] and six seats in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]]. In 2006, the party unexpectedly gained the governorship of the [[Shiga Prefecture]]. In the [[2009 Japanese general election|2009 general election]], the DPJ made large gains and the SDP maintained its base of 7 seats in the, becoming a junior partner in a new government coalition. However, disagreements over the issue of the [[Futenma]] base led to the sacking of Fukushima from the cabinet on 28 May and the SDP subsequently voted to leave the ruling coalition.<ref>BBC News [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10193171 Socialists leave Japan coalition over Okinawa issue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103120947/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10193171 |date=2010-11-03 }}</ref>\n\nAs of October 2010, the SDP had six members in the House of Representatives<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shugiin.go.jp/index.nsf/html/index_e_strength.htm|title=The House of Representatives|publisher=National Diet of Japan|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322185742/http://www.shugiin.go.jp/index.nsf/html/index_e_strength.htm|archive-date=22 March 2011|access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref> and four members in the House of Councillors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/member/members/index.htm|title=List of the Members|publisher=National Diet of Japan|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322230318/http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/member/members/index.htm|archive-date=22 March 2011|access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[2012 Japanese general election|2012 general election]], the party retained only six seats in the whole of the Diet, two in the House of Representatives and four in the House of Councillors.

However, most of the legislators joined the [[Democratic Party of Japan (1996\u201398)|Democratic Party of Japan]] after that. Five leftist legislators who did not join the SDP formed the [[New Socialist Party (Japan)|New Socialist Party]] which lost all its seats in the following elections. The SDP enjoyed a short period of government participation from 1993 to 1994 as part of the [[Morihiro Hosokawa#Cabinet|Hosokawa cabinet]] and later formed a coalition government with the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) under 81st [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Tomiichi Murayama]] of the JSP from 1994 to January 1996. The SDP was part of ruling coalitions between January and November 1996 (first [[Ryutaro Hashimoto|Hashimoto]] cabinet) and from 2009 to 2010 ([[Yukio Hatoyama#Cabinet|Hatoyama cabinet]]).\n\nAfter the [[2019 Japanese House of Councillors election|2019 House of Councillors election]], it has four representatives in the national Diet, two in the lower house and two in the upper house.\n\n[[File:Social Democratic Party of Japan - campaginvan - dec13-2012.jpg|thumb|A SDPJ campaign van outside a station in December 2012]]\n\n== History ==\n===Before 2000===\n{{main|Japan Socialist Party}}\nIn January 1996, the New Socialist Party split off, Murayama resigned as Prime Minister and the JSP changed its name from the JSP to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as an interim party for forming a new party. However, a movement for transforming the SDP into a new social-democratic and liberal party was unsuccessful. Under Murayama's successor [[Ry\u016btar\u014d Hashimoto]] (LDP), the SDP remained part of the ruling coalition. Long before the disappointing result in the [[1996 Japanese general election|1996 general election]], the party lost the majority of its members of the House of Representatives, mainly to predecessors of the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1996)|Democratic Party of Japan]] (DPJ) that was formed in 1996, but also some to the NFP and other opposition parties. After its electoral defeat in the 1996 general election when it lost another 15 of its remaining 30 seats in the lower house, the SDP left the ruling coalition which it had entered as the second largest force in Japanese politics as a minor party.\n\n=== 2000s\u20132010s ===\nThe SDP won six seats in the [[2003 Japanese general election|2003 general election]], compared with 18 seats in the previous [[2000 Japanese general election|2000 general election]]. Its motives against the Self-Defense Forces have reverted into abolishing it in the long term, returning into its opposition against the force it had applied in the 1950s.\n\nDoi had been the leader since 1996, but she resigned in 2003, taking responsibility for the election losses. [[Mizuho Fukushima]] was elected as the new party leader in November 2003. In the [[2004 Japanese House of Councillors election|2004 House of Councillors elections]], the SDP won only two seats, having five seats in the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]] and six seats in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]]. In 2006, the party unexpectedly gained the governorship of the [[Shiga Prefecture]]. In the [[2009 Japanese general election|2009 general election]], the DPJ made large gains and the SDP maintained its base of 7 seats in the, becoming a junior partner in a new government coalition. However, disagreements over the issue of the [[Futenma]] base led to the sacking of Fukushima from the cabinet on 28 May and the SDP subsequently voted to leave the ruling coalition.<ref>BBC News [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10193171 Socialists leave Japan coalition over Okinawa issue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103120947/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10193171 |date=2010-11-03 }}</ref>\n\nAs of October 2010, the SDP had six members in the House of Representatives<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shugiin.go.jp/index.nsf/html/index_e_strength.htm|title=The House of Representatives|publisher=National Diet of Japan|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322185742/http://www.shugiin.go.jp/index.nsf/html/index_e_strength.htm|archive-date=22 March 2011|access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref> and four members in the House of Councillors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/member/members/index.htm|title=List of the Members|publisher=National Diet of Japan|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322230318/http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/member/members/index.htm|archive-date=22 March 2011|access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[2012 Japanese general election|2012 general election]], the party retained only six seats in the whole of the Diet, two in the House of Representatives and four in the House of Councillors.

{"title_page": "Monsters in Dungeons & Dragons", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Monsters in ''Dungeons & Dragons''}}\n'''Monsters''' in the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[fantasy role-playing game]] are generally the antagonists which players must fight and defeat to progress in the game. Since the game's [[Dungeons & Dragons (1974)|first edition in 1974]], a [[bestiary]] was included along other game manuals, first called ''Monsters & Treasure'' and now commonly called the ''[[Monster Manual]]''. Described as an \"essential\" part of ''Dungeons & Dragons'', the game's monsters have become notable in their own right, influencing fields such as [[video games]] and [[fiction]], as well as [[popular culture]].<ref name=\"ashgate\">''The Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters''. Ed. Jeffrey Weinstock. 2014.</ref>\n\nThe term ''monster'' in ''Dungeons & Dragons'' can refer to a variety of creatures, including traditional [[monsters]] such as [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragons]], supernatural creatures such as ghosts, and mundane or fantastic animals\u2014in short, \"an enormous heterogeneous collection of natural and monstrous foes.\"<ref name=\"chrulew\">{{cite journal |last1=Churlew |first1=Matthew |date=2006 |title=\u201cMasters of the Wild\u201d: Animals and the Environment in ''Dungeons & Dragons'' |url=http://www.concentric-literature.url.tw/issues/Animals/6.pdf |journal=Concentric: Literary and Cultural Studies |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=135-168 |access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> While many monsters are adapted from pre-existing myths and legends, others have been invented specifically for the game, sometimes having characteristics specifically suited to the mechanics of the game.<ref name=\"chrulew\" />\n\n==Origins==\n{{for|publication history|Monster Manual}}\nThe sources of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' monsters are diverse, including [[mythology]], medieval [[bestiaries]], [[science-fiction literature|science-fiction]] and [[fantasy literature]], and [[film]]. In game books, monsters are typically presented with illustrations, fictional elements, and [[Statistic (role-playing games)|game statistics]]. Monsters are adapted to fit the needs of the game's writers and publishers, such as by describing combat abilities that may have been absent or only implied by an original source. In a few major cases, names taken from the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had to be changed due to [[copyright]] disputes (such as the balor, originally named [[Balrog]]), and fictional elements were altered to further distance the works.<ref name=\"ashgate\" />\n\nOriginal monsters have also been included in ''Dungeons & Dragons'', and these are among the game's most memorable. Monsters such as the [[gelatinous cube]] have been described as \"uniquely weird,\"<ref name=\"ashgate\" /> inspired by unusual sources or designed to suit the particular needs of a role-playing game. The rust monster and [[owlbear]], for instance, were based on toys purchased at a [[discount store]].<ref name=\"diterlizzi\">{{Cite web|url=https://diterlizzi.com/essay/owlbears-rust-monsters-and-bulettes-oh-my/|title=Owlbears, Rust Monsters and Bulettes, Oh My! \u2013 Tony DiTerlizzi}}</ref> The [[Mimic (Dungeons & Dragons)|mimic]] disguises itself as a chest, thwarting players expecting to find treasure.<ref name=\"io9\">{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-10-most-memorable-dungeons-dragons-monsters-1326074030|title=The 10 Most Memorable Dungeons & Dragons Monsters|website=io9}}</ref>\n\nBecause of their broad, inclusive background, ''D&D'' monsters have been called a [[pastiche]] of sources, freely combining qualities of classical works as well as modern or wholly original creations.<ref name=\"chrulew\" />\n\n==Influence and criticism==\nThe monsters of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' have significantly influenced modern fantasy fiction, ranging from licensed fiction, such as the novels of [[R.A. Salvatore]], [[Margaret Weis]], and [[Tracy Hickman]], to how monsters are portrayed in fantasy fiction generally. The scope of this influence has been compared to the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Indeed, as Jeffrey Weinstock notes, \"it is not even clear where Tolkien pastiche leaves off and Dungeons & Dragons pastiche begins in modern genre fantasy.\"<ref name=\"ashgate\" /> In a 2005 interview, author [[China Mieville]] stated,\n{{quote|\"I use AD&D-type fascination with [[teratology]] in a lot of my books, and I have the original Monster Manual, and the Monster Manual 2, and the Fiend Folio.

[[Gary Gygax]] wrote much of the work himself, having included and expanded most of the monsters from [[List of Dungeons & Dragons monsters (1974\u20131976)|the previous D&D supplements]]. Also included are monsters originally printed in ''The Strategic Review'', as well as some originally found in early issues of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'' (such as the anhkheg and [[remorhaz]]), and other early game materials.  This book also expanded on the original monster format, such as including the stat lines on the same page as the monsters' descriptions and introducing more stats, expanding the length of most monster descriptions, and featuring illustrations for most of the monsters. The book features an alphabetical table of contents of all the monsters on pages 3\u20134, explanatory notes for the statistics lines on pages 5\u20136, descriptions of the monsters on pages 6\u2013103, a treasure chart on page 105, and an index of major listings on pages 106\u2013109.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

While the ''Monster Manual'' consisted primarily of monsters previously published in ''D&D'' books edited by Gary Gygax, the ''Fiend Folio'' consisted mostly of monsters submitted to ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'''s \"Fiend Factory\" column. [[Don Turnbull (game designer)|Don Turnbull]], later Managing Director of TSR UK, was the editor for the \"Fiend Factory\" column, as well as the ''Fiend Folio'', which was billed as \"the first major British contribution to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game system.\"  The monsters in this book are presented in the same format as those in the previous ''Monster Manual'' work, and most featured illustrations of the monsters. Also, there are full-page black and white illustrations of various monsters throughout the book. The book contains a foreword on pages 3\u20134, an alphabetical table of contents on page 5, explanatory notes on pages 6\u20137, descriptions of the monsters on pages 8\u201397, a treasure chart on page 99, additional tables and charts for all the monsters in both the ''Monster Manual'' and ''Fiend Folio'' on pages 100\u2013119, an index of major listings (including the contributor for each monster) on pages 120\u2013124, with an epilogue on page 124.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

As with the ''Monster Manual'', this book was written primarily by [[Gary Gygax]]. While this book contains a number of monsters that previously appeared in limited circulation (such as in ''Dragon'' or in adventure modules), unlike the ''Monster Manual'' and ''Fiend Folio'' a large amount of its contents was entirely new at publication. The monsters in this book are presented in the same format as the ''Monster Manual'' and ''Fiend Folio''. The book contains a preface on page 4, a section entitled \"How To Use This Book\" on pages 5\u20137, descriptions of the monsters on pages 8\u2013132, random encounter tables on pages 133\u2013155, and an index of all the monsters in the ''Monster Manual'', ''Fiend Folio'', and ''Monster Manual II'' on pages 156\u2013160.

These include various races of demons and [[Devil (Dungeons & Dragons)|devils]] that are of an [[evil]] [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] and hail from the [[Outer Plane|Lower Planes]]. All fiends are extraplanar [[Outsider (Dungeons & Dragons)|outsiders]].\n\n===The most common types===\n\n====Demons====\n\n\nThe most widespread race of fiends are the demons, a [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Chaotic Evil|chaotic evil]] race native to the [[Abyss (Dungeons & Dragons)|Abyss]]; they are rapacious, cruel and arbitrary. The dominant race of demons is the tanar'ri {{IPAc-en|t|\u0259|\u02c8|n|\u0251r|i}}. The Abyss and its population are both theoretically infinite in size. \"True\" tanar'ri such as the [[balor (Dungeons & Dragons)|balor]]s (originally called [[Balrog]]s) and the six-armed serpentine [[marilith]]s push other weaker tanar'ri around and organise them into makeshift armies for battle. Demon lords and demon princes such as Orcus, [[Demogorgon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demogorgon]], Zuggtmoy, Graz'zt and countless others rule over the demons of their individual layers of the Abyss, in as much as the chaotic demons can be ruled over.\n\n====Devils====\nThe [[Devil (Dungeons & Dragons)|devils]], of which the ruling type are called baatezu {{IPAc-en|b|e\u026a|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|t|\u025b|z|u\u02d0}}, are [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Lawful Evil|lawful evil]] natives of the [[Baator|Nine Hells of Baator]]; they subjugate the weak and rule tyrannically over their domains. Pit fiends are the most powerful baatezu, though even the strongest pit fiends are surpassed by the [[Lords of the Nine]], or Archdevils, whose ranks include [[Baalzebul (Dungeons & Dragons)|Baalzebul]], [[Mephistopheles (Dungeons & Dragons)|Mephistopheles]], and [[Asmodeus (Dungeons & Dragons)|Asmodeus]]. Unlike the demons, the devils arranged themselves through a strict hierarchy. Like the demons, the devils are scheming backstabbers; while a demon only keeps its words when it is convenient for it, a devil keeps its word all too well; though being used to exploiting repressive bureaucratic machinations to the fullest, always knows all ways around the letter of a contract to begin with. The tanar'ri and the baatezu hold an eternal enmity for one another and wage the [[Blood War]] against one another.\n\n====Yugoloths====\nThe yugoloths (called [[daemon (mythology)|daemon]]s in 1st edition ''D&D'') are [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Neutral Evil|neutral evil]] natives of the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna and the [[Gray Waste|Gray Wastes of Hades]]; they are neutral to the affairs of the other fiendish races, interfering only when they see a situation that may be profitable or a potential for the advancement of their own schemes. The yugoloths are manipulative, secretive, and mercenary by nature, often acting as soldiers for deities in their own private wars, or even at times aiding both sides of the Blood War. In 4th Edition, the yugoloths are considered to be demons, and their previously standard naming convention of \"loth\" is replaced by \"demon\" (Ex. the Mezzoloth is the 4e Mezzodemon). In fifth edition, yugoloths are listed as neutral evil fiends under their original names.\n\n===Other fiends===\n\n====Demodands====\nThe demodands are race of evil fiends that live on the plane of [[Carceri (Dungeons & Dragons)|Carceri]] (Tarterus in 1st edition ''D&D''). Demodands were introduced in the 1st edition supplement ''[[Monster Manual II]]'', renamed as Gehreleths in the 2nd edition ''[[Monster Manual#Monstrous Compendium volumes issued|Monstrous Compendium Outer Planes Appendix]]'', and reintroduced as demodands in the 3rd edition sourcebook ''[[Fiend Folio]]''. In 1st edition ''D&D'', the three types of demodands from weakest to strongest were tarry, slime, and shaggy. In 2nd and 3rd editions, the three types are  farastu, kelubar, and shator.\n\n====Hordlings====\nThe '''hordlings''' are fiends that form the hordes of the [[Gray Waste|Gray Waste of Hades]]. They first appeared in the 1st edition supplement [[Monster Manual II]]. Hordlings wander the Gray Waste preying upon everything they come across, even other hordlings. Hordlings vary greatly in appearance. It is said that Hordlings evolved from Larvae whose hatred was so unique, their souls became individual. The hordlings can be summoned using an artifact known as the ''Bringer of Doom'', which was created around the time of the [[Invoked Devastation]] of [[Greyhawk]]. Hordlings are the most common inhabitants of the Gray Waste. They also occasionally roam the other Lower Planes as well.\n\n====Kython====\nThe kythons (not to be confused with kytons, which are chain devils [[Baatezu]]) are distinct from the other fiends in that they did not originate on any of the lower planes. When a group of fiends (the Galchutt, from Monte Cook's ''Chaositech'' and ''Ptolus'') were trapped on the [[Material Plane]], they tried creating more of their own kind through magical means. The results were eyeless reptilian creatures with insectoid traits and neutral evil traits. As the kythons matured, they took on varied forms. None of them were loyal to the fiends that created them. Because kythons originated on the Material Plane instead of the [[Abyss (plane)|Abyss]] (or another lower plane), they are also called earth-bound demons. Kythons are only interested in eating and breeding. They have spread rapidly across the [[Material Plane]]. The current hierarchy of kythons, from the weakest to the strongest is: broodlings, juveniles, adults, impalers, slaymasters, and slaughterkings. Eventually, with more time, kythons will grow into newer and more powerful forms. Kythons closely resemble [[Xenomorph (Alien)|xenomorphs]]. They were originally created for Monte Cook's Ptolus campaign, based on some gaming miniatures he had bought, and were added by him to the ''Book of Vile Darkness'' absent the context of the Galchutt, who wouldn't appear until later on in ''Chaositech''.\n\n[[Monte Cook]] originally planned on perhaps renaming them so their name was not quite so similar to kytons, or chain devils, as well as other episodes of Monte Cook's Ptolus campaign to see how they were originally used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://montecook.com/arch_ptolus1.html |title=Ptolus |last=Cook |first=Monte |authorlink=Monte Cook |date=2001-04-28 |accessdate=2008-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106044607/http://montecook.com/arch_ptolus1.html |archivedate=2009-01-06 }}</ref>\n\n====Night hags====\nNight hags are fiends from the Gray Wastes of Hades that traffic in the souls of mortals in 3rd edition sources.

This is markedly different from the portrayal of Slaadi in all prior editions of the game, when they were Chaotic Neutral natives of Limbo and thus not fiends.\n\n====Half-fiends and fiendish creatures====\nThe [[Cambion (Dungeons & Dragons)|cambions]] (whose name comes from a different kind of mythological, demonic creature) are simply half-fiends; [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] of fiends and non-fiendish creatures, often humans or other humanoids. Cambions are typically created through fiends raping mortals or seducing them after [[shape-shift]]ing, although some of the most depraved beings actually participate willingly. Those cambions that actually survive birth typically look like grotesque, hellish variants of their mortal progenitors, having wings, claws, fangs and often many other features that reveal their fiendish origins. Cambions are usually outcast, being feared and hated in mortal societies for their fiendish origins and being derided by pure-blooded fiends for their impure heritage. A variant of cambion called durzagon is described in ''[[Monster Manual|Monster Manual II]]'' and is the hybrid of a devil and an unsuspecting [[Duergar (Dungeons & Dragons)|duergar]]. The fiendish creatures are simply fiendish versions of other species in Dungeons & Dragons. They typically look like fearsome travesties of beings from the [[Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|material plane]]. Most fiendish species are divided into a number of variants, usually in a [[hierarchy]] of increasing power and cunning.\n\n====Other fiends not associated with a specific group====\n*Abominations \u2013 (Chichimec, phane, infernal, dream larva, phaethon, xixecal, hecatoncheires) \u2013 the unwanted offspring of deities.\n*Abyssal Drake \u2013 the result of an ancient breeding program that combines the nastiest elements of demons, wyverns, and red dragons.

Since the game's [[Dungeons & Dragons (1974)|first edition in 1974]], a [[bestiary]] was included along other game manuals, first called ''Monsters & Treasure'' and now commonly called the ''[[Monster Manual]]''.

In game books, monsters are typically presented with illustrations, fictional elements, and [[Statistic (role-playing games)|game statistics]]. Monsters are adapted to fit the needs of the game's writers and publishers, such as by describing combat abilities that may have been absent or only implied by an original source. In a few major cases, names taken from the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had to be changed due to [[copyright]] disputes (such as the balor, originally named [[Balrog]]), and fictional elements were altered to further distance the works.<ref name=\"ashgate\" />\n\nOriginal monsters have also been included in ''Dungeons & Dragons'', and these are among the game's most memorable. Monsters such as the [[gelatinous cube]] have been described as \"uniquely weird,\"<ref name=\"ashgate\" /> inspired by unusual sources or designed to suit the particular needs of a role-playing game. The rust monster and [[owlbear]], for instance, were based on toys purchased at a [[discount store]].<ref name=\"diterlizzi\">{{Cite web|url=https://diterlizzi.com/essay/owlbears-rust-monsters-and-bulettes-oh-my/|title=Owlbears, Rust Monsters and Bulettes, Oh My! \u2013 Tony DiTerlizzi}}</ref> The [[Mimic (Dungeons & Dragons)|mimic]] disguises itself as a chest, thwarting players expecting to find treasure.<ref name=\"io9\">{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-10-most-memorable-dungeons-dragons-monsters-1326074030|title=The 10 Most Memorable Dungeons & Dragons Monsters|website=io9}}</ref>\n\nBecause of their broad, inclusive background, ''D&D'' monsters have been called a [[pastiche]] of sources, freely combining qualities of classical works as well as modern or wholly original creations.<ref name=\"chrulew\" />\n\n==Influence and criticism==\nThe monsters of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' have significantly influenced modern fantasy fiction, ranging from licensed fiction, such as the novels of [[R.A. Salvatore]], [[Margaret Weis]], and [[Tracy Hickman]], to how monsters are portrayed in fantasy fiction generally. The scope of this influence has been compared to the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Indeed, as Jeffrey Weinstock notes, \"it is not even clear where Tolkien pastiche leaves off and Dungeons & Dragons pastiche begins in modern genre fantasy.\"<ref name=\"ashgate\" /> In a 2005 interview, author [[China Mieville]] stated,\n{{quote|\"I use AD&D-type fascination with [[teratology]] in a lot of my books, and I have the original Monster Manual, and the Monster Manual 2, and the Fiend Folio.

Also included are monsters originally printed in ''The Strategic Review'', as well as some originally found in early issues of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'' (such as the anhkheg and [[remorhaz]]), and other early game materials.  This book also expanded on the original monster format, such as including the stat lines on the same page as the monsters' descriptions and introducing more stats, expanding the length of most monster descriptions, and featuring illustrations for most of the monsters. The book features an alphabetical table of contents of all the monsters on pages 3\u20134, explanatory notes for the statistics lines on pages 5\u20136, descriptions of the monsters on pages 6\u2013103, a treasure chart on page 105, and an index of major listings on pages 106\u2013109.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

While the ''Monster Manual'' consisted primarily of monsters previously published in ''D&D'' books edited by Gary Gygax, the ''Fiend Folio'' consisted mostly of monsters submitted to ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'''s \"Fiend Factory\" column. [[Don Turnbull (game designer)|Don Turnbull]], later Managing Director of TSR UK, was the editor for the \"Fiend Factory\" column, as well as the ''Fiend Folio'', which was billed as \"the first major British contribution to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game system.\"  The monsters in this book are presented in the same format as those in the previous ''Monster Manual'' work, and most featured illustrations of the monsters. Also, there are full-page black and white illustrations of various monsters throughout the book. The book contains a foreword on pages 3\u20134, an alphabetical table of contents on page 5, explanatory notes on pages 6\u20137, descriptions of the monsters on pages 8\u201397, a treasure chart on page 99, additional tables and charts for all the monsters in both the ''Monster Manual'' and ''Fiend Folio'' on pages 100\u2013119, an index of major listings (including the contributor for each monster) on pages 120\u2013124, with an epilogue on page 124.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

As with the ''Monster Manual'', this book was written primarily by [[Gary Gygax]]. While this book contains a number of monsters that previously appeared in limited circulation (such as in ''Dragon'' or in adventure modules), unlike the ''Monster Manual'' and ''Fiend Folio'' a large amount of its contents was entirely new at publication. The monsters in this book are presented in the same format as the ''Monster Manual'' and ''Fiend Folio''. The book contains a preface on page 4, a section entitled \"How To Use This Book\" on pages 5\u20137, descriptions of the monsters on pages 8\u2013132, random encounter tables on pages 133\u2013155, and an index of all the monsters in the ''Monster Manual'', ''Fiend Folio'', and ''Monster Manual II'' on pages 156\u2013160.

These include various races of demons and [[Devil (Dungeons & Dragons)|devils]] that are of an [[evil]] [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] and hail from the [[Outer Plane|Lower Planes]]. All fiends are extraplanar [[Outsider (Dungeons & Dragons)|outsiders]].\n\n===The most common types===\n\n====Demons====\n\n\nThe most widespread race of fiends are the demons, a [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Chaotic Evil|chaotic evil]] race native to the [[Abyss (Dungeons & Dragons)|Abyss]]; they are rapacious, cruel and arbitrary. The dominant race of demons is the tanar'ri {{IPAc-en|t|\u0259|\u02c8|n|\u0251r|i}}. The Abyss and its population are both theoretically infinite in size. \"True\" tanar'ri such as the [[balor (Dungeons & Dragons)|balor]]s (originally called [[Balrog]]s) and the six-armed serpentine [[marilith]]s push other weaker tanar'ri around and organise them into makeshift armies for battle. Demon lords and demon princes such as Orcus, [[Demogorgon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demogorgon]], Zuggtmoy, [[Graz'zt]] and countless others rule over the demons of their individual layers of the Abyss, in as much as the chaotic demons can be ruled over.\n\n====Devils====\nThe [[Devil (Dungeons & Dragons)|devils]], of which the ruling type are called baatezu {{IPAc-en|b|e\u026a|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|t|\u025b|z|u\u02d0}}, are [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Lawful Evil|lawful evil]] natives of the [[Baator|Nine Hells of Baator]]; they subjugate the weak and rule tyrannically over their domains. Pit fiends are the most powerful baatezu, though even the strongest pit fiends are surpassed by the [[Lords of the Nine]], or Archdevils, whose ranks include [[Baalzebul (Dungeons & Dragons)|Baalzebul]], [[Mephistopheles (Dungeons & Dragons)|Mephistopheles]], and [[Asmodeus (Dungeons & Dragons)|Asmodeus]]. Unlike the demons, the devils arranged themselves through a strict hierarchy. Like the demons, the devils are scheming backstabbers; while a demon only keeps its words when it is convenient for it, a devil keeps its word all too well; though being used to exploiting repressive bureaucratic machinations to the fullest, always knows all ways around the letter of a contract to begin with. The tanar'ri and the baatezu hold an eternal enmity for one another and wage the [[Blood War]] against one another.\n\n====Yugoloths====\nThe yugoloths (called [[daemon (mythology)|daemon]]s in 1st edition ''D&D'') are [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Neutral Evil|neutral evil]] natives of the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna and the [[Gray Waste|Gray Wastes of Hades]]; they are neutral to the affairs of the other fiendish races, interfering only when they see a situation that may be profitable or a potential for the advancement of their own schemes. The yugoloths are manipulative, secretive, and mercenary by nature, often acting as soldiers for deities in their own private wars, or even at times aiding both sides of the Blood War. In 4th Edition, the yugoloths are considered to be demons, and their previously standard naming convention of \"loth\" is replaced by \"demon\" (Ex. the Mezzoloth is the 4e Mezzodemon). In fifth edition, yugoloths are listed as neutral evil fiends under their original names.\n\n===Other fiends===\n\n====Demodands====\nThe demodands are race of evil fiends that live on the plane of [[Carceri (Dungeons & Dragons)|Carceri]] (Tarterus in 1st edition ''D&D''). Demodands were introduced in the 1st edition supplement ''[[Monster Manual II]]'', renamed as Gehreleths in the 2nd edition ''[[Monster Manual#Monstrous Compendium volumes issued|Monstrous Compendium Outer Planes Appendix]]'', and reintroduced as demodands in the 3rd edition sourcebook ''[[Fiend Folio]]''. In 1st edition ''D&D'', the three types of demodands from weakest to strongest were tarry, slime, and shaggy. In 2nd and 3rd editions, the three types are  farastu, kelubar, and shator.\n\n====Hordlings====\nThe '''hordlings''' are fiends that form the hordes of the [[Gray Waste|Gray Waste of Hades]]. They first appeared in the 1st edition supplement [[Monster Manual II]]. Hordlings wander the Gray Waste preying upon everything they come across, even other hordlings. Hordlings vary greatly in appearance. It is said that Hordlings evolved from Larvae whose hatred was so unique, their souls became individual. The hordlings can be summoned using an artifact known as the ''Bringer of Doom'', which was created around the time of the [[Invoked Devastation]] of [[Greyhawk]]. Hordlings are the most common inhabitants of the Gray Waste. They also occasionally roam the other Lower Planes as well.\n\n====Kython====\nThe kythons (not to be confused with kytons, which are chain devils [[Baatezu]]) are distinct from the other fiends in that they did not originate on any of the lower planes. When a group of fiends (the Galchutt, from Monte Cook's ''Chaositech'' and ''Ptolus'') were trapped on the [[Material Plane]], they tried creating more of their own kind through magical means. The results were eyeless reptilian creatures with insectoid traits and neutral evil traits. As the kythons matured, they took on varied forms. None of them were loyal to the fiends that created them. Because kythons originated on the Material Plane instead of the [[Abyss (plane)|Abyss]] (or another lower plane), they are also called earth-bound demons. Kythons are only interested in eating and breeding. They have spread rapidly across the [[Material Plane]]. The current hierarchy of kythons, from the weakest to the strongest is: broodlings, juveniles, adults, impalers, slaymasters, and slaughterkings. Eventually, with more time, kythons will grow into newer and more powerful forms. Kythons closely resemble [[Xenomorph (Alien)|xenomorphs]]. They were originally created for Monte Cook's Ptolus campaign, based on some gaming miniatures he had bought, and were added by him to the ''Book of Vile Darkness'' absent the context of the Galchutt, who wouldn't appear until later on in ''Chaositech''.\n\n[[Monte Cook]] originally planned on perhaps renaming them so their name was not quite so similar to kytons, or chain devils, as well as other episodes of Monte Cook's Ptolus campaign to see how they were originally used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://montecook.com/arch_ptolus1.html |title=Ptolus |last=Cook |first=Monte |authorlink=Monte Cook |date=2001-04-28 |accessdate=2008-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106044607/http://montecook.com/arch_ptolus1.html |archivedate=2009-01-06 }}</ref>\n\n====Night hags====\nNight hags are fiends from the Gray Wastes of Hades that traffic in the souls of mortals in 3rd edition sources. In 5th edition they come from the [[Feywild]] and are exiled to the [[Gray Wastes of Hades]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Crawford |editor1-first=Jeremy |title=D&D Monster manual. |date=2014 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=978-0-7869-6561-8 |pages=177 |edition=Fifthition}}</ref>\n\n====Rakshasas====\n[[Rakshasa (Dungeons & Dragons)|Rakshasas]] are fiends (often tiger-headed) that may have originated on [[Acheron (plane)|Acheron]] according to 3rd edition sources. In 5th edition they originated in the [[Nine Hells]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Crawford |editor1-first=Jeremy |title=D&D Monster manual. |date=2014 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=978-0-7869-6561-8 |page=257 |edition=Fifthition}}</ref>\n\n====Slaad====\nIn the 4th Edition game, Slaadi are Chaotic Evil and originate out of the Elemental Chaos. This is markedly different from the portrayal of Slaadi in all prior editions of the game, when they were Chaotic Neutral natives of Limbo and thus not fiends.\n\n====Half-fiends and fiendish creatures====\nThe [[Cambion (Dungeons & Dragons)|cambions]] (whose name comes from a different kind of mythological, demonic creature) are simply half-fiends; [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] of fiends and non-fiendish creatures, often humans or other humanoids. Cambions are typically created through fiends raping mortals or seducing them after [[shape-shift]]ing, although some of the most depraved beings actually participate willingly. Those cambions that actually survive birth typically look like grotesque, hellish variants of their mortal progenitors, having wings, claws, fangs and often many other features that reveal their fiendish origins. Cambions are usually outcast, being feared and hated in mortal societies for their fiendish origins and being derided by pure-blooded fiends for their impure heritage. A variant of cambion called durzagon is described in ''[[Monster Manual|Monster Manual II]]'' and is the hybrid of a devil and an unsuspecting [[Duergar (Dungeons & Dragons)|duergar]]. The fiendish creatures are simply fiendish versions of other species in Dungeons & Dragons. They typically look like fearsome travesties of beings from the [[Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|material plane]]. Most fiendish species are divided into a number of variants, usually in a [[hierarchy]] of increasing power and cunning.\n\n====Other fiends not associated with a specific group====\n*Abominations \u2013 (Chichimec, phane, infernal, dream larva, phaethon, xixecal, hecatoncheires) \u2013 the unwanted offspring of deities.\n*Abyssal Drake \u2013 the result of an ancient breeding program that combines the nastiest elements of demons, wyverns, and red dragons.

While the 1st edition of ''AD&D'' used the term \"Daemon\", all subsequent editions beginning with 2nd edition have used the term \"yugoloth\" for the same creatures.\n\n===Reception===\nFiends were considered among the \"standard repertoire of \"Monsters\"\" of the game by Fabian Perlini-Pfister.<ref>{{cite book |title=Religions in play: games, rituals, and virtual worlds |last=Bornet |first=Philippe |year=2011 |publisher=Theologischer Verlag Z\u00fcrich |location= |isbn=978-3-290-22010-5 |page=282 |accessdate=5 December 2019 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=t3X18dopUoMC&pg=PA282#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">Fabian Perlini-Pfister uses the word \"demon\" instead of fiend, but uses \"Asmodeus and succubi\" as examples.</ref>\n\n===Blood War===\nThe Blood War concept was introduced as part of the new background for the outer planes in 1991's ''Monstrous Compendium Volume Outer Planes Appendix''. The conflict is depicted as a bitter war of annihilation between the baatezu race and the tanar'ri; an absolute, all encompassing, and virtually eternal struggle.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Game Wizards|last=Brown|first=Timothy B.|authorlink=Timothy Brown (game designer)|journal=Dragon|issue=165|date=January 1991|pages=89}}</ref>  Trenton Webb of ''Arcane'' magazine wrote, \"the fate of all the planes hangs on its outcome\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Webb|first=Trenton|date=October 1996|title=Games Reviews|journal=Arcane|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|issue=11|pages=71}}</ref>  The Blood War was thoroughly detailed in various books throughout the [[Planescape]] setting, particularly the 1996 boxed set ''[[Hellbound: The Blood War]]''.<ref name=mythology/>  The 4th edition of D&D's ''[[Manual of the Planes]]'' updated the Blood War into a smoldering cold war that was formerly an all-out war.{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe Blood War has been given various causes across different game books.  ''[[Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss]]'' attributes it to an offshoot of the primordial battles between law and chaos, continued out of violent and sadistic stubbornness.<ref>[[James Jacobs (game designer)|Jacobs, James]], [[Erik Mona]], and [[Ed Stark]]. ''[[Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2006)</ref><ref name=\"FC2\"/>  ''[[Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of the Nine Hells]]'' depicts [[Asmodeus (Dungeons & Dragons)|Asmodeus]] as a formerly angelic being tasked with fighting an eternal war against the demons.  When he and his followers take on demonic traits to better combat their foes, these angels, now deemed devils, are either exiled to or granted (depending on perspective) their own plane, where they fight the Blood War without disturbing the primordial lords of order.  This is depicted as possibly being self-serving historical revisionism.<ref name=\"FC2\">[[Robin Laws|Laws, Robin D.]], and [[Robert J. Schwalb]]. ''[[Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of the Nine Hells]]'' (Wizards of the Coast, 2006).</ref>  The ''[[Guide to Hell]]'' instead portrays the Blood War as a distraction by Asmodeus to hide his true goal of usurping divine power and reshaping the multiverse.<ref name=\"GtH\">Pramas, Chris. ''Guide to Hell'' (TSR, 1999)</ref>  Later official materials claim Asmodeus possesses a piece of the pure elemental chaos [[Tharizdun]] used to create the Abyss.  The demons are drawn to this and seek to reclaim it.<ref name=\"GtH\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bestiary]]\n*[[Dungeons & Dragons controversies]]\n*[[List of species in fantasy fiction]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[James Jacobs (game designer)|Jacobs, James]], [[Erik Mona]], and [[Ed Stark]].
