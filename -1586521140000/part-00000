[[Dairy]] farming is the principal activity. Good trout fishing is to be had in the numerous streams of the area. As a town, Matatiele is the reference point for all of the northern Transkei. \n\nThe name \"Matatiele\" is clearly a [[Sesotho language|Sotho]] word{{According to whom|date=October 2019}},  based on the Sesotho phrase \"matata aile\" meaning \"the ducks have gone\". In [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], the town name is pronounced \"Madadiyela\". The common informal name for the town in any of the languages mentioned, including English, is \"Matat\". Those who are born there call it \"sweet Matat\". The town became more popular when a [[Generations (South African TV series)|Generations]] producer Mfundi Vundla wrote a story about Matatiele Where the Actor real name \"Nambitha Mpulawana\" acted as a Matatiele Born. there was also a Tv show called \"Matatiele\" that aired two families Xhosa and Sesotho families who were not getting along at all but unfortunately they could not stop children from dating, that forced them to sit on the table to negotiate [[lobola]]. Matatiele is the hometown of the socialist Selby Buhle Baqwa of Mzongwana.\n\nThe residents in and around Matatiele, as in most of the northern Transkei region, are generally bilingual in Hlubi, isiXhosa and Sesotho. Many speak English.
