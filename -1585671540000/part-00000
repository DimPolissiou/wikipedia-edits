It diverts water from the [[Kishanganga River]] ([[Neelum River]]) to a power plant in the [[Jhelum River]] basin. It is located {{Convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Bandipore]] in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and has an installed capacity of 330&nbsp;MW. Construction on the project began in 2007 and was expected to be complete in 2016. Construction on the dam was temporarily halted by the Hague's [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] (CoA) in October 2011 due to [[Pakistan|Pakistan's]] protest of its effect on the flow of the Kishanganga River (called the [[Neelum River]] in Pakistan). In December 2013, the Court ruled that India could divert water for power generation while ensuring a minimum flow of 9 cumecs (m<sup>3</sup>/s) downstream to [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]].<ref name=Ahmad>{{cite web |author=Omair Ahmad |title=The Indus Waters Treaty: caught between a dispute and a hard place |newspaper=The Third Pole |date=15 June 2018 |url=https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/2018/06/15/the-indus-waters-treaty-caught-between-a-dispute-and-a-hard-place/ |accessdate=20 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=Tribune>[https://tribune.com.pk/story/648986/kishanganga-project-victory-claims-cloud-final-arbitration-award/ Kishanganga project: Victory claims cloud final arbitration award], The Express Tribune, 22 December 2013.</ref>\n\nAll  three units of 110 MW each were commissioned and synchronized with the electricity grid by 30 March 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title= NHPC's Kishanganga project fully commissioned |url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/over-8-cr-epfo-accounts-have-no-birth-date-11-cr-missing-fathers-name/1281602?scroll |accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> On 19 May 2018, Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] inaugurated the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.livemint.com/Politics/1d6mcw4oPoymB4h2g40GiK/Narendra-Modi-inaugurates-Kishanganga-hydropower-project-in.html |title=Narendra Modi inaugurates Kishanganga hydropower project in Kashmir}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n{{Location map+|Kashmir|width=200|float=left |caption=Location of the Neelum\u2013Jhelum and Kishanganga projects in [[Kashmir]] |places=\n{{Location map~|Kashmir |lat_deg=34|lat_min=23|lat_sec=34|lat_dir=N|lon_deg=73|lon_min=43|lon_sec=08|lon_dir=E|position=top|mark_size=8|label_size=0|label=N\u2013J project}}\n{{Location map~ |Kashmir|lat_deg=34|lat_min=11|lat_sec=54|lat_dir=N|lon_deg=73|lon_min=30|lon_sec=41|lon_dir=E|position=bottom|label_size=75|label=N\u2013J project}}\n{{Location map~| Kashmir|lat_deg=34|lat_min=38|lat_sec=51|lat_dir=N|lon_deg=74|lon_min=45|lon_sec=53|lon_dir=E|position=right|label_size=75|label=Kishenganga project}}\n{{Location map~ |Kashmir|lat_deg=34|lat_min=28|lat_sec=21|lat_dir=N|lon_deg=74|lon_min=38|lon_sec=06|lon_dir=E|position=bottom|label_size=0|label=Kishenganga project}}\n}} \nThe westward flowing [[Jhelum River]] has two main tributaries, one being the [[Kishenganga River]] ([[Neelum River]]) in the north at a higher elevation and the other being the Jhelum river itself at a lower elevation.

Both India and Pakistan have explored the possibility and came up with respective projects: the Kishenganga project in Indian-administered Kashmir and the [[Neelum\u2013Jhelum Dam|Neelum\u2013Jhelum project]] in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.{{sfn|Briscoe|2010|p=29}}\n\nThe Kishanganga project includes a {{Convert|37|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall [[concrete-face rock-fill dam]] which diverts a portion (58.4 m3/sec) of the Kishanganga River south through a {{Convert|24|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} tunnel. The tunnel is received by a [[surge chamber]] before sending water to the [[underground power house]] which contains {{nowrap|3 x 110 MW}} [[Pelton turbine]]-generators. After the power plant, water is discharged through a tail race channel into Bonar Nallah, another tributary of Jhelum (at {{coord|34.473|74.635}}). After a short distance the Bonar Nallah drains into the [[Wular Lake]], on the course of the Jhelum River.

However, India is allowed \"non-consumptive\" uses of the water such as power generation. Under the treaty, India is obliged to inform Pakistan of its intent to build a project six months prior to construction and take into account any concerns raised by the latter.\n\nPakistan strenuously objected to the whole project. It believed that India was not permitted under the Indus Waters Treaty to divert waters from one tributary to another.{{sfn|Khan|2013|p=215}} Experts have disagreed with this contention. John Briscoe, a former World Bank water expert, points out that the \"far-sighted Indian and Pakistani engineers\" who drafted the treaty very well anticipated the situation.<ref name=Briscoe>John Briscoe, [https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/winning-the-battle-but-losing-the-war/article4439676.ece Winning the battle but losing the war], The Hindu, 22 February 2013.</ref> The paragraph 15 of Annexure D states,\n{{quote|Where a Plant is located on a tributary of the Jhelum on which Pakistan has any agricultural use or hydroelectric use, ''the water released below the plant may be delivered, if necessary, into another tributary'' but only to the extent that the then existing agricultural use or hydroelectric use by Pakistan on the former tributary would not be adversely affected. (emphasis added)<ref name=Briscoe/>}}\nNevertheless, Pakistan maintained that the diversion of water was prohibited. Asif H. Kazi, an influential water professional, declared, \"the treaty absolutely forbids India from undertaking their project\".<ref>Kazi, Asif H.

Frankin Berman and Howard S. Wheater were the legal and engineer members respectively. India nominated Lucius Catflisch and Judge Peter Tomka, president of ICJ. Pakistan nominated Jan Paulsson and Judge Bruno Simma.{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=309}}}}\n\nThe Court began by rejecting Pakistan's arguments that the Kishanganga project violated the provisions of the treaty.{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=309}} Then it considered whether the project satisfied the treaty's requirements for hydroelectric plants. Article III(2) obligates India to \"let flow all the waters of Western Rivers\" and \"not permit any interference with the waters\".{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=309}} Pakistan argued that the project violated Annexure D of the treaty in three respects:{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=310}}\n* by the permanent diversion of waters from one tributary to another,\n* by failure to conform to the requirements for a permitted run-of-the-river plant (by locating the plant along a diversion rather than at the dam site), and\n* by a diversion of waters between two tributaries that was not \"necessary\".\nThe court rejected all three objections by analysing the treaty and its negotiating history.{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=310}}\n\nThe final question was whether the diversion met the requirement of protecting \"the ''then existing'' agricultural use or hydro-electric use by Pakistan\". The court addressed the issue with a sophisticated Vienna Convention analysis. It rejected Pakistan's \"ambulatory\" interpretation that all its future uses that might evolve over time were protected and upheld India's interpreation that only those uses existing when Pakistan was given complete inforation about the project were protected.{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=310}} The court determined that the Neelum\u2013Jhelum project did not exist at the time the Kishenganga project \"crystallized\". Hence, it was not protected by the treaty provisions.{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=311}}\n\nThe court upheld India's right to proceed with the Kishanganga project. But it also concluded that the treaty and the [[customary international law]] required India to ensure a minimum environmental flow along the Kishanganga/Neelum riverbed. After requesting additional data from India and Pakistan to determine the requirements for minimum flow, the court determined this to be 12 cumecs. Balancing this figure against India's right to the satisfactory operation of its project, it set down 9 cumecs as the required minimum flow to be ensured at all times.{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=312}}\n\n=== Drawdown flushing ===\n{{expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe CoA also ruled that India shall not lower/draw down the water level below the dead storage level for sediment flushing purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Indus Waters Treaty - Kishanganga verdict aftermath |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=217&v=vcJl3nLCi14 |accessdate=20 January 2019}}</ref> CoA also stipulated in its verdict that India shall maintain minimum environmental flows in the Kishanganga river at the line of control point not be less than 9 cumecs continuously.<ref name=final>{{cite web |title=Final award of CoA dated 20 December 2013 |url=https://pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/48 |accessdate=20 June 2018}}</ref>   However, the minor differences between India and Pakistan over the project are still not settled.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pause and effect: What newest twist in Indus Treaty tale means |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-pakistan-relation-indus-water-treaty-kishanganga-and-ratle-hydropower-projects-4437894/ |accessdate=20 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Kishanganga conundrum |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1445800/the-kishanganga-conundrum |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe Project was taken up by [[National Hydroelectric Power Corporation]] (NHPC).

Downstream of the Kishanganga dam, the river is taking U-turn to enter in to the Pakistan territory. Nearly 100 million cubic meters capacity storage dam can be envisaged close to the [[Line of Control|LoC]] to impound all the inflows which can be further pumped through a 6 km long tunnel in to the upstream Kishanganga dam reservoir. The augmented water in to the Kishanganga dam reservoir is also diverted to the Jhelum river to generate additional power by the 330 MW power plant. As the pumping head (90 m) is not exceeding 15% of the 664 m head available for the power generation, the storage reservoir with pumping facility is highly economical to utilize all the waters of Kishanganga river flowing in India. Water pumping from the storage works/reservoir could be achieved by installing a [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage scheme]] to generate peaking and secondary power additionally.\n\n==Inauguration==\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Kishanganga power plant in the state of Jammu and Kashmir on the 19th of May, 2018. \nThe 330MW Kishanganga hydropower station, work on which started in 2009, is one of the projects that India has fast-tracked in the volatile state amid frosty ties between the nuclear-armed countries.\n\"This region cannot only become self-sufficient in power but also produce for other regions of the country,\" Modi said in the state\u00b4s capital, Srinagar. \"Keeping that in mind we have been working on various projects here for the past four years.\" Pakistan has opposed some of these projects, saying they violate a World Bank-mediated treaty on the sharing of the Indus River and its tributaries upon which 80 percent of its irrigated agriculture depends.\n\n==Local Concerns==\nIn 2013 local population of [[Bandipora]] protested against [[Hindustan Construction Company]] (HCC) executing the 330 MW Kishenganga hydroelectric project in the area.

The tunnel is received by a [[surge chamber]] before sending water to the [[underground power house]] which contains {{nowrap|3 x 110 MW}} [[Pelton turbine]]-generators. After the power plant, water is discharged through a tail race channel into Bonar Nallah, another tributary of Jhelum (at {{coord|34.473|74.635}}). After a short distance the Bonar Nallah drains into the [[Wular Lake]], on the course of the Jhelum River. The drop in elevation from the dam to the power station provides a [[hydraulic head]] of {{Convert|646|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kishanganga |url=http://www.nhpcindia.com/projectdetail.htm?CatId=1&ProjectId=32|publisher=NHPC Limited|accessdate=3 Feb 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe dam is equipped with lower level orifice spillway to transfer flood water as well as the silt to the down stream for not to affect power generation reliability and the operating life.<ref>{{cite web|title= CoA verdict dated 18 February 2013 on Kishanganga hydro power project (page 94) | url = https://pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/1681|accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref> The arbitration award permitted the lower level orifice spillway as envisaged by India but prohibited the depletion of dead storage.\n\n==Indus waters dispute==\nThe waters of the Jhelum river and its tributaries are allocated to Pakistan under the [[Indus Waters Treaty]] of 1960 (part of the three 'western rivers' \u2013 Indus, Jhelum and Chenab). However, India is allowed \"non-consumptive\" uses of the water such as power generation. Under the treaty, India is obliged to inform Pakistan of its intent to build a project six months prior to construction and take into account any concerns raised by the latter.\n\nPakistan strenuously objected to the whole project. It believed that India was not permitted under the Indus Waters Treaty to divert waters from one tributary to another.{{sfn|Khan|2013|p=215}} Experts have disagreed with this contention. John Briscoe, a former World Bank water expert, points out that the \"far-sighted Indian and Pakistani engineers\" who drafted the treaty very well anticipated the situation.<ref name=Briscoe>John Briscoe, [https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/winning-the-battle-but-losing-the-war/article4439676.ece Winning the battle but losing the war], The Hindu, 22 February 2013.</ref> The paragraph 15 of Annexure D states,\n{{quote|Where a Plant is located on a tributary of the Jhelum on which Pakistan has any agricultural use or hydroelectric use, ''the water released below the plant may be delivered, if necessary, into another tributary'' but only to the extent that the then existing agricultural use or hydroelectric use by Pakistan on the former tributary would not be adversely affected. (emphasis added)<ref name=Briscoe/>}}\nNevertheless, Pakistan maintained that the diversion of water was prohibited. Asif H. Kazi, an influential water professional, declared, \"the treaty absolutely forbids India from undertaking their project\".<ref>Kazi, Asif H.

Frankin Berman and Howard S. Wheater were the legal and engineer members respectively. India nominated Lucius Catflisch and Judge Peter Tomka, president of ICJ. Pakistan nominated Jan Paulsson and Judge Bruno Simma.{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=309}}}}\n\nThe Court began by rejecting Pakistan's arguments that the Kishanganga project violated the provisions of the treaty.{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=309}} Then it considered whether the project satisfied the treaty's requirements for hydroelectric plants. Article III(2) obligates India to \"let flow all the waters of Western Rivers\" and \"not permit any interference with the waters\".{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=309}} Pakistan argued that the project violated Annexure D of the treaty in three respects:{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=310}}\n* by the permanent diversion of waters from one tributary to another,\n* by failure to conform to the requirements for a permitted run-of-the-river plant (by locating the plant along a diversion rather than at the dam site), and\n* by a diversion of waters between two tributaries that was not \"necessary\".\nThe court rejected all three objections by analysing the treaty and its negotiating history.{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=310}}\n\nThe final question was whether the diversion met the requirement of protecting \"the ''then existing'' agricultural use or hydro-electric use by Pakistan\". The court addressed the issue with a sophisticated Vienna Convention analysis. It rejected Pakistan's \"ambulatory\" interpretation that all its future uses that might evolve over time were protected and upheld India's interpreation that only those uses existing when Pakistan was given complete inforation about the project were protected.{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=310}} The court determined that the Neelum\u2013Jhelum project did not exist at the time the Kishenganga project \"crystallized\". Hence, it was not protected by the treaty provisions.{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=311}}\n\nThe court upheld India's right to proceed with the Kishanganga project. But it also concluded that the treaty and the [[customary international law]] required India to ensure a minimum environmental flow along the Kishanganga/Neelum riverbed. After requesting additional data from India and Pakistan to determine the requirements for minimum flow, the court determined this to be 12 cumecs. Balancing this figure against India's right to the satisfactory operation of its project, it set down 9 cumecs as the required minimum flow to be ensured at all times.{{sfn|Crook|2014|p=312}}\n\n=== Drawdown flushing ===\n{{expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe CoA also ruled that India shall not lower/draw down the water level below the dead storage level for sediment flushing purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Indus Waters Treaty - Kishanganga verdict aftermath |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=217&v=vcJl3nLCi14 |accessdate=20 January 2019}}</ref> CoA also stipulated in its verdict that India shall maintain minimum environmental flows in the Kishanganga river at the line of control point not be less than 9 cumecs continuously.<ref name=final>{{cite web |title=Final award of CoA dated 20 December 2013 |url=https://pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/48 |accessdate=20 June 2018}}</ref>   However, the minor differences between India and Pakistan over the project are still not settled.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pause and effect: What newest twist in Indus Treaty tale means |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-pakistan-relation-indus-water-treaty-kishanganga-and-ratle-hydropower-projects-4437894/ |accessdate=20 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Kishanganga conundrum |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1445800/the-kishanganga-conundrum |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe Project was taken up by [[National Hydroelectric Power Corporation]] (NHPC).

Downstream of the Kishanganga dam, the river is taking U-turn to enter in to the Pakistan territory. Nearly 100 million cubic meters capacity storage dam can be envisaged close to the [[Line of Control|LoC]] to impound all the inflows which can be further pumped through a 6 km long tunnel in to the upstream Kishanganga dam reservoir. The augmented water in to the Kishanganga dam reservoir is also diverted to the Jhelum river to generate additional power by the 330 MW power plant. As the pumping head (90 m) is not exceeding 15% of the 664 m head available for the power generation, the storage reservoir with pumping facility is highly economical to utilize all the waters of Kishanganga river flowing in India. Water pumping from the storage works/reservoir could be achieved by installing a [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage scheme]] to generate peaking and secondary power additionally.\n\n==Inauguration==\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Kishanganga power plant in the state of Jammu and Kashmir on the 19th of May, 2018. \nThe 330MW Kishanganga hydropower station, work on which started in 2009, is one of the projects that India has fast-tracked in the volatile state amid frosty ties between the nuclear-armed countries.\n\"This region cannot only become self-sufficient in power but also produce for other regions of the country,\" Modi said in the state\u00b4s capital, Srinagar. \"Keeping that in mind we have been working on various projects here for the past four years.\" Pakistan has opposed some of these projects, saying they violate a World Bank-mediated treaty on the sharing of the Indus River and its tributaries upon which 80 percent of its irrigated agriculture depends.\n\n==Local Concerns==\nIn 2013 local population of [[Bandipora]] protested against [[Hindustan Construction Company]] (HCC) executing the 330 MW Kishenganga hydroelectric project in the area.

The Turks soon conquered Banjani, and the Orlovi\u0107 brothers, after spending merely a winter there, Bajko, Bjelan and Nenoje (other sources call him \"Bajo\"), continued on to ''R\u017eani do'' in [[Cuce]], whereas, the fourth brother, Tepo, returned to \u010cara\u0111e and founded the clan Tepav\u010devi\u0107i. Bajko, Bjelan and Nenoje later established a church in the village dedicated to their patron saint, [[John the Baptist|Saint John]]. However, Bajko later moved to ''Zaljut'' in [[Cuce]] with the rest of his family, effectively branching off and creating the Bajkovi\u0107i clan. Bjelan with his family moved to Resna, thus founding the clan Bjelice. One of his most famous descendants is voivode Milija, a prominent figure of the national  Montenegrin epic The Mountain Wreath, written by [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]]. From voivode Milija descend the brotherhood Mili\u0107i. Nenoje (Bajo) moved to the last retreat, in the wake of the advancing Ottoman Turks, of the last [[Principality of Zeta|Zetan]] medieval dynasty, [[Cetinje]] (an area called Bajice), with his family, thus founding the Martinovi\u0107i clan.\n\nAccording to one of the versions of the Orlovi\u0107 family story Jovan Erdeljanovi\u0107 heard in Bajice, four brothers did in fact relocate from Gacko to Cuce. However, they were named as follows: Bajko, Bjelan, Nenoje and \u010cejo. Bajko remained in Cuce, where his offspring founded the Bajkovi\u0107 clan. Bjelan moved to Bjelice, and his descendants founded the modern-day clans of Mili\u0107i, Abramovi\u0107i, etc. Nenoje moved to Bajice, where his descendants would later branch off into the Martinovi\u0107 and Vuksanovi\u0107 clans. \u010cejo returned to Gacko and converted to Islam, effectively creating the \u010cengi\u0107 clan. According to this legend, there were three more brothers, who had initially remained in \u010cara\u0111e. One of the brothers would establish the [[Samard\u017ei\u0107]] clan in Krivo\u0161ije. The second brother was the ancestor of the Bandi\u0107i in Komani, as well as the \u0110uri\u010di\u0107i in Zagara\u010d. The third brother converted to Islam and established the prominent Muslim Osmanagi\u0107 family in Podgorica.<ref name=\"Drago\" />\n\nHowever, Kovijani\u0107 considers more probable the version according to which Pavle's so-called \"sons\" were actually his relatives, even though he doesn't elaborate on that at all.<ref name=Kovijani>{{cite book | last= Kovijani\u0107 |first= Risto |title= Crnogorska plemena u kotorskim spomenicima, Vol. I |year= 1963 | language= Serbian}}</ref>{{rp|152}} On the other hand, when talking about the true timeframe of the migration of the Orlovi\u0107 family, Kovijani\u0107 relies exclusively on historical documents, not on oral tradition, which \"popular tradition ties to the fall of [[Herzegovina]] (1482).<ref name=Kovijani />{{rp|153}} Thus [[Konstantin Josef Jire\u010dek|Jire\u010dek]] cites that the first mention of the clan Bjelica in Konavli, region adjacent to Dubrovnik and repossessed by them at that time, dates from 1430 (\"50-60 houses of ''Vlachorum Belize'' from [[Principality of Zeta|Zeta]]\")<ref name=\"Kulturna istorija Srba do 1537 godine\">{{cite book|last=Jire\u010dek|first=Konstantin Josef|title=Istorija Srba.

Since Ivanovich is a [[patronymic]] revealing the name of his grandfather Ivan and father Nenoe, Kovijani\u0107 concludes that, given the timeframe, Ivan could well have been a contemporary of the main actors of the [[Battle of Kosovo]], including his relative Pavle Orlovi\u0107 himself, one of the two main characters of the folk epic poem [[Kosovo Maiden|The Kosovo Maiden (Serbian: Kosovka djevojka)'']] It is probably on the basis of this information contrasted with many versions of the story of the family migration and those involved in it which overlap but are not identical, that Kovijani\u0107 concludes that it is more likely that the migration did not involve direct offspring of Pavle Orlovi\u0107 but his (many) relatives. Kovijani\u0107 also holds that, contrary to Erdeljanovi\u0107, the [[toponyms]] in Bajice that carry the imprint of the old family name Orlovi\u0107 after the immigrants from \u010cara\u0111e and not after some previous inhabitants of Bajice.

In 1482, the Turks attacked the fort, and Bijela heroically died in the aftermath.

On the road, they ate in the town of Gacko, where they spent the night with knez Vratko. Pavle's mother had come to like knez Vratko's daughter, and she arranged a marriage for her and her Milija.

The two-headed eagle of the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty was the imitation of the one introduced by the emperor [[Isaac I Komnenos|Isaac I Komnenos (or Comnenus).]] The coat of arms of the Orlovi\u0107 family featured here comes from the unreliable [[Koreni\u0107-Neori\u0107 Armorial]] and the fact that, in this territory in-between the East and the West, it represents an obvious crusader influence. [[Uro\u0161 Predi\u0107]], in his famous painting The Kosovo Maiden, depicts the agonizing Pavle Orlovi\u0107 with a coat of arms featuring a black eagle on a red background Other than through marriages with royal houses Petrovi\u0107 of Montenegro and Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 of Serbia, and the fact that a branch of Martinovi\u0107 family may stand at the beginnings of the Serbian dynasty Obrenovi\u0107, none of Pavle Orlovi\u0107's descendants has a recognized status of nobility. There are claims, so far unsubstantiated, that the famous [[Serbian-American]] scientist [[Nikola Tesla]] is also a descendant of the clan Orlovi\u0107.{{cn|date=December 2014}}\n\nSince a noble family is, in both Christian West and East, characterized by a major role\nit plays in the affairs of a state, usually military, but also by its possessions, it would\nbe normal to expect that there are historical testimonies to that effect. However, written\nrecords are practically non-existent, except when it comes to various military roles assumed by some members of the clan throughout the Turkish period, mainly as defenders of the lands of Montenegro and Hercegovina.{{cn|date=December 2014}}\n\nThere are varied oral accounts whose reliability is ultimately unverifiable, starting with [[Vuk Orle]] as a commander of the [[Soko Grad (Ljubovija)|Soko Grad]] on the border between Serbia and Bosnia. In case of Montenegro, it seems that many of the possessions of the former Montenegrin dynasty Crnojevi\u0107, made extinct by the Turks, have been occupied by various branches of the clan, but that doesn't necessarily speak of any blood relation between the two families. An interesting fact is that one of the members of the Martinovi\u0107 branch, patriarch Arsenios, located in the immediate vicinity of the old Crnojevic capital Cetinje, took the surname \u010carnojevic (Church Slavonic version of the surname Crnojevic) before leading its flock to the territory of the Austria-Hungary, in the first of the [[Great Serb Migrations|great migrations of the Serbs]].{{cn|date=December 2014}}\n\nGiven the so-called historic territories the clan occupies today - mainly Hercegovina and Montenegro - and that are more or less identical to the territories it occupied at the beginning of the Turkish occupation, no conclusion can be drawn that would support any extraordinary possessions of any member of the clan. If anything, the only thing that can be inferred is that its possessions stand in the inverse proportion to the role it played in the liberation of the Serb lands. The territories of the old Montenegro are arguably the harshest and hardest to eke out existence from - with insufficient land, with virtually no water, territories that bear names such as \"sea of rocks\" etc. - a territory very similar to that of Greece, for instance. In fact, Montenegro is sometimes called \"Serbian Sparta\". The claim of the Orlovi\u0107 line of descent of the Serbian Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty aside, only those families, considered by some to be branches of the clan, that converted to Islam, can be considered noble in the generally accepted sense, because they did have nobility titles and possessions. It is unknown to what extent those may have been equivalents of the existing titles conferred upon them by the Ottomans (aga, spahi, bey). The same can be said of the lands they may have inherited or given by the occupier.{{cn|date=December 2014}}\n\nDescendants of the Orlovi\u0107 can be found in the royal families [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] through the Princess Ljubica \"Ziva\" of Serbia, and [[House of Savoy]] through the [[Elena of Montenegro|Queen Elena of Italy]], daughters of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]], and Montenegrin Royal house of [[Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] through various members of the Martinovi\u0107 family.

One of his sons (historians dis-agree as to which one) decided to carry the surname Orli\u0107 (Eaglette) in honor and natural succession of the Orlovi\u0107 (Eagle) surname. The Orli\u0107 clan then settled in Petrovac in modern-day Montenegro.<ref name=Samardzic />\n\nIn the 1550s the majority of the Orli\u0107 clan emigrated to Krbava in modern-day Croatia.

In 1638, a number of the Orlic clan relocated further north west to Brinje to the villages of Dra\u0161kovica and Vodote\u0107 where they lived, tax free, defending the Austro-Hungarian empire from the Ottomans. Nowadays, members of the Orli\u0107 clan are found all across the former Yugoslavia.<ref>D.

According to Andrija Luburi\u0107, however, it is said that the Osmanagi\u0107i descend from Jovan Orlovi\u0107, Martin Orlovi\u0107's grandson. It is said that Jovan was imprisoned by the Turks as a child in Gacko during his family's escape to Montenegro. Jovan was taken to Mostar and later \"turkicized\", meaning converted to Islam. According to certain documents, Jovan's descendants were called the Koski\u0107i and they lived in Mostar. In 1650, the Koski\u0107i relocated to Podgorica.

The Turks soon conquered Banjani, and the Orlovi\u0107 brothers, after spending merely a winter there, Bajko, Bjelan and Nenoje (other sources call him \"Bajo\"), continued on to ''R\u017eani do'' in [[Cuce]], whereas, the fourth brother, Tepo, returned to \u010cara\u0111e and founded the clan Tepav\u010devi\u0107i. Bajko, Bjelan and Nenoje later established a church in the village dedicated to their patron saint, [[John the Baptist|Saint John]]. However, Bajko later moved to ''Zaljut'' in [[Cuce]] with the rest of his family, effectively branching off and creating the Bajkovi\u0107i clan. Bjelan with his family moved to Resna, thus founding the clan Bjelice. One of his most famous descendants is voivode Milija, a prominent figure of the national  Montenegrin epic The Mountain Wreath, written by [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]]. From voivode Milija descend the brotherhood Mili\u0107i. Nenoje (Bajo) moved to the last retreat, in the wake of the advancing Ottoman Turks, of the last [[Principality of Zeta|Zetan]] medieval dynasty, [[Cetinje]] (an area called Bajice), with his family, thus founding the Martinovi\u0107i clan.\n\nAccording to one of the versions of the Orlovi\u0107 family story Jovan Erdeljanovi\u0107 heard in Bajice, four brothers did in fact relocate from Gacko to Cuce. However, they were named as follows: Bajko, Bjelan, Nenoje and \u010cejo. Bajko remained in Cuce, where his offspring founded the Bajkovi\u0107 clan. Bjelan moved to Bjelice, and his descendants founded the modern-day clans of Mili\u0107i, Abramovi\u0107i, etc. Nenoje moved to Bajice, where his descendants would later branch off into the Martinovi\u0107 and Vuksanovi\u0107 clans. \u010cejo returned to Gacko and converted to Islam, effectively creating the \u010cengi\u0107 clan. According to this legend, there were three more brothers, who had initially remained in \u010cara\u0111e. One of the brothers would establish the [[Samard\u017ei\u0107]] clan in Krivo\u0161ije. The second brother was the ancestor of the Bandi\u0107i in Komani, as well as the \u0110uri\u010di\u0107i in Zagara\u010d. The third brother converted to Islam and established the prominent Muslim Osmanagi\u0107 family in Podgorica.<ref name=\"Drago\" />\n\nHowever, Kovijani\u0107 considers more probable the version according to which Pavle's so-called \"sons\" were actually his relatives, even though he doesn't elaborate on that at all.<ref name=Kovijani>{{cite book | last= Kovijani\u0107 |first= Risto |title= Crnogorska plemena u kotorskim spomenicima, Vol. I |year= 1963 | language= Serbian}}</ref>{{rp|152}} On the other hand, when talking about the true timeframe of the migration of the Orlovi\u0107 family, Kovijani\u0107 relies exclusively on historical documents, not on oral tradition, which \"popular tradition ties to the fall of [[Herzegovina]] (1482).<ref name=Kovijani />{{rp|153}} Thus [[Konstantin Josef Jire\u010dek|Jire\u010dek]] cites that the first mention of the clan Bjelica in Konavli, region adjacent to Dubrovnik and repossessed by them at that time, dates from 1430 (\"50-60 houses of ''Vlachorum Belize'' from [[Principality of Zeta|Zeta]]\")<ref name=\"Kulturna istorija Srba do 1537 godine\">{{cite book|last=Jire\u010dek|first=Konstantin Josef|title=Istorija Srba.

Since Ivanovich is a [[patronymic]] revealing the name of his grandfather Ivan and father Nenoe, Kovijani\u0107 concludes that, given the timeframe, Ivan could well have been a contemporary of the main actors of the [[Battle of Kosovo]], including his relative Pavle Orlovi\u0107 himself, one of the two main characters of the folk epic poem [[Kosovo Maiden|The Kosovo Maiden (Serbian: Kosovka djevojka)'']] It is probably on the basis of this information contrasted with many versions of the story of the family migration and those involved in it which overlap but are not identical, that Kovijani\u0107 concludes that it is more likely that the migration did not involve direct offspring of Pavle Orlovi\u0107 but his (many) relatives. Kovijani\u0107 also holds that, contrary to Erdeljanovi\u0107, the [[toponyms]] in Bajice that carry the imprint of the old family name Orlovi\u0107 after the immigrants from \u010cara\u0111e and not after some previous inhabitants of Bajice.

On the road, they ate in the town of Gacko, where they spent the night with knez Vratko. Pavle's mother had come to like knez Vratko's daughter, and she arranged a marriage for her and her Milija. After the wedding, Milija remained in Gacko with his in-laws meanwhile his mother continued her journey to Dubrovnik.

Bijela fought with the neighboring Turks from the fortress in nearby Klju\u010da for 20 years (Klju\u010da was captured by the Turks in 1463).

Bjelan, served as the ancestor of the Orlovi\u0107i in Bjelice. Two of Bajko's sons, Vu\u010di\u0107 and Vu\u010deta, later branched off and founded the Bajkovi\u0107 clan in Cuce, ultimately, with their uncle Culo, becoming the ancestors of the Orlovi\u0107i in Cuce.

The two-headed eagle of the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty was the imitation of the one introduced by the emperor [[Isaac I Komnenos|Isaac I Komnenos (or Comnenus).]] The coat of arms of the Orlovi\u0107 family featured here comes from the unreliable [[Koreni\u0107-Neori\u0107 Armorial]] and the fact that, in this territory in-between the East and the West, it represents an obvious crusader influence. [[Uro\u0161 Predi\u0107]], in his famous painting The Kosovo Maiden, depicts the agonizing Pavle Orlovi\u0107 with a coat of arms featuring a black eagle on a red background Other than through marriages with royal houses Petrovi\u0107 of Montenegro and Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 of Serbia, and the fact that a branch of Martinovi\u0107 family may stand at the beginnings of the Serbian dynasty Obrenovi\u0107, none of Pavle Orlovi\u0107's descendants has a recognized status of nobility. There are claims, so far unsubstantiated, that the famous [[Serbian-American]] scientist [[Nikola Tesla]] is also a descendant of the clan Orlovi\u0107.{{cn|date=December 2014}}\n\nSince a noble family is, in both Christian West and East, characterized by a major role\nit plays in the affairs of a state, usually military, but also by its possessions, it would\nbe normal to expect that there are historical testimonies to that effect. However, written\nrecords are practically non-existent, except when it comes to various military roles assumed by some members of the clan throughout the Turkish period, mainly as defenders of the lands of Montenegro and Hercegovina.{{cn|date=December 2014}}\n\nThere are varied oral accounts whose reliability is ultimately unverifiable, starting with [[Vuk Orle]] as a commander of the [[Soko Grad (Ljubovija)|Soko Grad]] on the border between Serbia and Bosnia. In case of Montenegro, it seems that many of the possessions of the former Montenegrin dynasty Crnojevi\u0107, made extinct by the Turks, have been occupied by various branches of the clan, but that doesn't necessarily speak of any blood relation between the two families. An interesting fact is that one of the members of the Martinovi\u0107 branch, patriarch Arsenios, located in the immediate vicinity of the old Crnojevic capital Cetinje, took the surname \u010carnojevic (Church Slavonic version of the surname Crnojevic) before leading its flock to the territory of the Austria-Hungary, in the first of the [[Great Serb Migrations|great migrations of the Serbs]].{{cn|date=December 2014}}\n\nGiven the so-called historic territories the clan occupies today - mainly Hercegovina and Montenegro - and that are more or less identical to the territories it occupied at the beginning of the Turkish occupation, no conclusion can be drawn that would support any extraordinary possessions of any member of the clan. If anything, the only thing that can be inferred is that its possessions stand in the inverse proportion to the role it played in the liberation of the Serb lands. The territories of the old Montenegro are arguably the harshest and hardest to eke out existence from - with insufficient land, with virtually no water, territories that bear names such as \"sea of rocks\" etc. - a territory very similar to that of Greece, for instance. In fact, Montenegro is sometimes called \"Serbian Sparta\". The claim of the Orlovi\u0107 line of descent of the Serbian Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty aside, only those families, considered by some to be branches of the clan, that converted to Islam, can be considered noble in the generally accepted sense, because they did have nobility titles and possessions. It is unknown to what extent those may have been equivalents of the existing titles conferred upon them by the Ottomans (aga, spahi, bey). The same can be said of the lands they may have inherited or given by the occupier.{{cn|date=December 2014}}\n\nDescendants of the Orlovi\u0107 can be found in the royal families [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] through the Princess Ljubica \"Ziva\" of Serbia, and [[House of Savoy]] through the [[Elena of Montenegro|Queen Elena of Italy]], daughters of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]], and Montenegrin Royal house of [[Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] through various members of the Martinovi\u0107 family. All things considered, the latter seem to occupy the most prominent place, both in terms of geography and history, within the Orlovi\u0107 clan.{{cn|date=December 2014}}\n\n==Orli\u0107==\nThe \"Orli\u0107i\" are descendants of [[Pavle Orlovi\u0107]] and are connected to the oldest living Serbian noble house dating from [[Vuk Orle]].<ref name=Samardzic />\n\nTraditionally, the Orli\u0107 surname is associated with the area of Lika in modern-day Croatia but many of the descendants of the Orli\u0107 clan can be found all over the world.<ref>Stanovni\u0161tvo prema narodnosti, popis (2001); Dr\u017eavni zavod za statistiku Republike Hrvatske (2012) (in Croatian)</ref>\n\nAccording to legend, after the death of Pavle Orlovi\u0107 at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (depicted by the famous [[Kosovo Maiden]] painting), his four sons escape their hometown, \u010cara\u0111e, near Gacko, and flee to a village called \"Velimlje\", in Banjani (modern-day Montenegro). One of his sons (historians dis-agree as to which one) decided to carry the surname Orli\u0107 (Eaglette) in honor and natural succession of the Orlovi\u0107 (Eagle) surname. The Orli\u0107 clan then settled in Petrovac in modern-day Montenegro.<ref name=Samardzic />\n\nIn the 1550s the majority of the Orli\u0107 clan emigrated to Krbava in modern-day Croatia. They fled from the onslaught of the Ottoman Empire.  In 1638, a number of the Orlic clan relocated further north west to Brinje to the villages of Dra\u0161kovica and Vodote\u0107 where they lived, tax free, defending the Austro-Hungarian empire from the Ottomans. Nowadays, members of the Orli\u0107 clan are found all across the former Yugoslavia.<ref>D.
