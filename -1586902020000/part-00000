Being Canadians, they were not attacked (it was during the [[War of 1812]]), and evacuated to Detroit. In 1844 Kinzie published ''Narrative of the Massacre at Chicago, August 15, 1812, and of Some Preceding Events'', anonymously, but acknowledged authorship soon after publication.\n\nHer second book ''Wau-Bun: The \"Early Day\" in the North West'',<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/lhbum:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28lhbum16762%29%29:@@@$REF$ Wau-bun, the early day in the Northwest. by Mrs. John H. Kinzie]</ref> extended her first book. It recounted her experiences at Fort Winnebago in the early 1830s, as well as those of her mother-in-law and other relatives during the [[Black Hawk War]]. The title reflects the local word for daybreak. Kinzie described her journeys back and forth to the early settlement of Chicago, and complex cultural encounters with a diverse frontier society. Unusual for its day, the book also described sympathetically and in detail the lives of Native Americans, who were being displaced by her extended family and other white settlers. An appendix included excerpts from the journals of relative [[Thomas Forsyth (Indian agent)|Thomas Forsyth]], who blamed the United States (rather than the Sauk) for starting the war.<ref>http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/emeritus/baym/essays/waubun.htm</ref> Published by Derby and Jackson in 1856, it was reprinted 19 times by the end of that century, and four more times in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whspress/oss/destination_wisconsin3.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123034005/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whspress/oss/destination_wisconsin3.asp |archivedate=2008-11-23 }}</ref><ref>http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/4690/Kinzie-Juliette-Augusta-Magill-1806-1870.html</ref> At least one 20th century historian found it unduly romantic, and criticized it for exaggerating the importance of her relatives, particularly her father-in-law.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/410079.html</ref>\n\nIn 1869 her novel ''Walter Ogilby'' was published. Her ''Narrative...'' was reworked and released as ''Mark Logan, the Bourgeois'' in 1871 following her death.\n\n==Family and legacy==\nJuliette and John Kinzie had seven children, six of whom survived to adulthood. John Kinzie served as U.S. Army paymaster for Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois troops in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and died of a heart attack on his way to a vacation shortly after President Lincoln's assassination. One son died fighting for the Union in the Civil War, two others were taken prisoner by Confederate forces but survived.\n\nTheir daughter Eleanor (Nellie) married [[William Washington Gordon II]], son of [[William Washington Gordon]] of [[Savannah, Georgia]]. In 1860, they named their second child after grandmother Juliette, and [[Juliette Gordon Low]] later founded [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouting]] in America in 1912.<ref>http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h2893{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Nellie also followed her mother's example by expressing outrage over the treatment of Native American heritage sites and monuments, and caused the [[National Society of the Colonial Dames of America]] in the State of Wisconsin to erect a new monument to [[Tomochichi]] (who had donated the land on which Savannah began) after the [[Central of Georgia Railway]] erected a monument to her father-in-law displacing a previous Tomochichi monument.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe house in which the Kinzie family lived in what is now [[Portage, Wisconsin]], as discussed in ''Wau-bun'', is now known as the [[Old Indian Agency House]].

He also played for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]].\n\nSouness' managerial career began when he joined Rangers, leading them to three [[List of Scottish football champions|Scottish titles]] and four league cups, before joining Liverpool as manager. He went on to become manager of [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Torino F.C.|Torino]], [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\nHas more medals than Pogba. \n\n==Playing career==\n===Early career===\nSouness was brought up in the [[Saughton]] Mains area of [[Edinburgh]], and supported local side [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/4371828.stm |title=Pulling at Hearts' strings |first=Clive |last=Lindsay |work=BBC Sport |date=24 October 2005 |accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref> and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Focus on Graeme Souness from Shoot! 1986 |url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/617|publisher=LFC History|accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref> As a teenager, Souness played for local boys' club [[Shandon, Edinburgh|North Merchiston]].\n\nSouness' career began as an apprentice at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] under [[Bill Nicholson (footballer)|Bill Nicholson]]. He signed professional forms as a 15-year-old in 1968. Frustrated at a lack of first-team opportunities, the teenage Souness reputedly informed Nicholson he was the best player at the club. Souness made one first-team appearance for Spurs, in a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] tie as a substitute.\n\nDuring the summer of 1972, Souness played in the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|North American Soccer League]] for the [[Montreal Olympique]]. He appeared in 10 of his team's 14 matches and was named in the league's All-Star team for that season.\n\n===Middlesbrough===\nSpurs sold Souness to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] for \u00a330,000 in 1972. He made his first appearance for Middlesbrough on 6 January 1973 in a 2\u20131 league defeat to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] at [[Craven Cottage]]. His first goal came on 11 December 1973 in a 3\u20130 league victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] at [[Ayresome Park]].\n\nSouness' tenacious style began to garner acclaim during his time at Middlesbrough. His first season saw Middlesbrough finish fourth, two places and 14 points short of promotion. [[Jack Charlton]] was appointed Middlesbrough manager, his first managerial post, in May 1973. One of Charlton's first signings was experienced former [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] midfielder [[Bobby Murdoch]], a fellow Scot whom Souness later cited as an important influence in the development of his playing style.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/1332240.stm |title=Bobby Murdoch: An obituary |work=BBC Sport |date=15 May 2001 |accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref> Promotion as champions of the [[Football League Division Two|Second Division]] followed in [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374]].

After winning his first [[1976\u201377 European Cup|European Cup]] in 1977, Liverpool manager [[Bob Paisley]] sought reinforcements by signing three Scottish players, all of whom were to contribute substantially to further success. Central defender [[Alan Hansen]] arrived from [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] for \u00a3110,000. [[Kenny Dalglish]] \u2013 an established Scottish international \u2013 signed from [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] for a then British record fee of \u00a3440,000. Souness formed the final part of the Scottish triumvirate, leaving Middlesbrough in acrimonious circumstances for a club-record fee of \u00a3350,000 on 10 January 1978.<ref>[http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/415 lfchistory.net Player Profile]</ref>\n\nSouness' Liverpool debut came in a 1\u20130 league victory over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at [[The Hawthorns]] on 14 January 1978. His first goal \u2013 a volley from just inside the penalty box, eventually awarded fans' goal of the season \u2013 came in a 3\u20131 win over bitter rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at Anfield on 25 February 1978.\n\nSouness played a critical role in Liverpool's retention of the [[1977\u201378 European Cup|European Cup]] against [[Club Brugge KV|FC Bruges]] in [[1978 European Cup Final|1978]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], providing the pass for Kenny Dalglish to score the match's only goal.\n\nSustained success followed. Souness's first League title medals were won in seasons [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]] and [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]]. A second [[1980\u201381 European Cup|European Cup]] medal for Souness arrived in [[1981 European Cup Final|1981]] with a 1\u20130 victory over [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] \u2013 the culmination of a campaign in which Souness scored a hat-trick in the quarter-final against [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]].\n\nThis burst of success prompted Paisley to award Souness the club captaincy for season [[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]], to the chagrin of the incumbent [[Phil Thompson]] who had made some errors that season and with whom Paisley had a vicious row during one match at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].<ref name=\"amazon.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0002181347 |title=No Half Measures: Amazon.co.uk: Graeme Souness, Bob Harris: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date=28 March 1985 |accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref> Thompson initially refused to speak to Souness, claiming he had \"stolen the captaincy\" from behind his back.

For the trophy award presentation after the 2\u20131 win over Manchester United in [[1983 Football League Cup Final|1983]], Souness stepped back and insisted that Paisley collect the trophy, it being the manager's retirement season.\n\nIn [[1983\u201384 in English football|1983\u201384]], Souness lifted three trophies.

Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] for a fee of \u00a3650,000. Souness and England international [[Trevor Francis]] \u2013 a player at the [[Genoa]]-based club since 1982 \u2013 added experience to an emerging group of future [[Italy national football team|Italian internationals]], including [[Roberto Mancini]], [[Pietro Vierchowod]] and [[Gianluca Vialli]]. In his first season, Sampdoria won the [[Coppa Italia]] with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Serie A]] rivals [[A.C.

He made 73 appearances in total for Rangers (50 in the league), scoring three goals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/rangers/player.php?playerid=1367 |title=Rangers player Graeme Souness|publisher=Fitbastats.com|accessdate=16 April 2017}}</ref> before retiring as a player in 1991 at age 38.

His move to Liverpool increased his profile. Souness missed Scotland's firs two matches, a defeat to [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and a draw with [[Iran national football team|Iran]], due to injury. He was selected for the final group match against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. Souness contributed to a 3\u20132 victory that nevertheless saw Scotland eliminated from the tournament on goal difference.<ref name = \"my world cup\"/>\n\nSouness played in two further World Cups. The first, in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] in Spain, saw Souness play all three group stage matches.

Souness' appointment as Rangers' manager garnered most attention, but his arrival as a player was also of significance. Souness arrived at Ibrox with a reputation as one of Europe's leading midfielders, a view evidenced by his success at Liverpool and, to a lesser extent, with Sampdoria. His signing was unusual in that Scottish clubs had rarely been able to sign top-quality internationals, including Scots, from other leagues.<ref name=\"revolution\"/>\n\nWhat came popularly to be termed the \"Souness Revolution\" began with a slew of major signings from English clubs. Significantly, this reversed the historic pattern of Scotland's most able footballers playing in England. Souness' first season saw the arrival of players such as [[Terry Butcher]], captain of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and an established [[England national football team|England international]], and [[Chris Woods]] of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], England's second-choice goalkeeper. Subsequent seasons saw the arrival of other English internationals, such as [[Trevor Steven]], [[Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1963)|Gary Stevens]], [[Trevor Francis]] and [[Ray Wilkins]]. Souness was able to offer the lure of European club competition, at a time \u2013 1985\u20131990 \u2013 when English clubs were banned from Europe in the wake of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Rangers profited from this by embarking upon a signing policy which drew on their relative wealth to compete, for the first time, directly with England's most powerful clubs.\n\nSouness' revitalised Rangers quickly began to dominate Scottish football. In his first season, [[1986\u201387 in Scottish football|1986\u201387]], they won the Championship and the League Cup, defeating Celtic 2\u20131 in the final.

His most noteworthy act was the controversial signing of [[Mo Johnston]] in 1989. Rangers, historically a team supported by [[Protestant]]s, had for most of the 20th century [[Rangers F.C. signing policy|a policy]] of refusing to sign [[Roman Catholic]]s.

He made a major reorganisation of the squad for the following season, bringing in [[Dean Saunders]] for an English record of \u00a32.9&nbsp;million as well as defenders [[Mark Wright (footballer, born 1963)|Mark Wright]] and [[Rob Jones (footballer, born 1971)|Rob Jones]] and midfielder [[Mark Walters]]. He also gave a regular place in the team to 19-year-old midfielder [[Steve McManaman]], whose debut had come under Dalglish in December 1990, and near the end of that campaign, he gave a professional contract to youth team striker [[Robbie Fowler]].\n\nDuring the early stages of the [[1991\u201392 Liverpool F.C. season|1991\u201392 season]], Liverpool were looking like serious title contenders, but it soon became an effective two-horse race between [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Leeds eventually took the title, while Liverpool came sixth. They returned to European competition that season after six years of isolation following the [[Heysel disaster]] of 1985, and reached the [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup quarter-finals]], where they were eliminated by [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].\n\nSouness had major [[heart surgery]] in April 1992. A controversy arose after the [[1991\u201392 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-final against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], which Liverpool needed a replay and penalties to win. In the event of a victory for Liverpool, an interview was due to be published in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|the Sun]]'', a British tabloid, with Souness celebrating the win and his own successful surgery.<ref name = \"lfc profile\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/profile-tougher-than-his-old-boots-graeme-souness-still-managing-liverpool-1480208.html |title=Profile: Tougher than his old boots: Graeme Souness, still managing Liverpool |work=The Independent |publisher= |date=23 January 1993 |accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref> The photograph which accompanied the interview was of Souness, in his hospital ward, kissing his girlfriend with joy at his own recovery and his team's win.<ref name = \"lfc profile\"/> The interview was due to go in alongside the match report on 14 April 1992, but the late end to the game meant the deadline for publication was missed and the report, with interview and photograph, went in on 15 April instead \u2013 the third anniversary of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], which had claimed the lives of 95 fans (a [[Tony Bland|96th victim]] would die in 1993, having never regained consciousness).<ref name = \"lfc profile\"/> Liverpool fans reacted with fury after seeing the interview was conducted with ''The Sun'', a newspaper which had been boycotted by many people in Liverpool for the intervening years over its reporting of the events at Hillsborough.<ref name = \"lfc profile\"/> Souness himself had restricted Liverpool players from talking to ''The Sun''.<ref name = \"lfc profile\"/> Although he apologised at the time, Souness has since said that he probably should have resigned there and then.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2011/02/08/ex-liverpool-fc-boss-graeme-souness-sorry-for-the-sun-hillsborough-interview-100252-28131085/ Ex-Liverpool FC boss Graeme Souness sorry for The Sun Hillsborough interview - Liverpool Echo<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Souness attended the [[1992 FA Cup Final]], which Liverpool won 2\u20130 against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], against the advice of his doctors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/18/seven-deadly-sins-football-liverpool-souness-mcmanaman |title=Souness's Cup final recovery - Wembley, 1992 |first=Steve |last=McManaman |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=18 May 2009 |accessdate=13 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393]] was an even more frustrating season for Souness. Just after the start of the season, he sold [[Dean Saunders]] to Aston Villa. While Saunders was a key player in Villa's near-successful title challenge, his successor [[Paul Stewart (footballer, born 1964)|Paul Stewart]] proved to be perhaps the biggest flop to play under Souness at Liverpool, scoring just 1 league goal from 32 appearances over the next two seasons and missing many games through injury. Top scorer [[Ian Rush]] was having a difficult time getting goals, and Liverpool spent most of the season in the bottom half of the table. They entered March still only in 15th place, but an excellent final quarter of the season, in which Rush scored 11 Premier League goals, saw them finish sixth.\n\nThe fans were running out of patience with Souness, but he made one last attempt at revitalising Liverpool by signing defender [[Julian Dicks]] and striker [[Nigel Clough]] for the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394 season]]. The season began well enough, but a dismal run of form in early winter effectively ended hopes of the [[Premier League]] title and Souness resigned as Liverpool manager at the end of January 1994 when Liverpool had suffered a shock [[1993\u201394 FA Cup|FA Cup]] exit at the hands of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. He was succeeded by coach [[Roy Evans]].\n\nSouness' reign as Liverpool manager was not remembered with fondness by the club's fans, though there were some positive events. Apart from guiding them to FA Cup success in 1992, he also oversaw the breakthrough of three young players who would go on to be a key part in Liverpool's better performances over the next five years \u2013 Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler and [[Jamie Redknapp]], allowing them to play and develop in the first team where they went on to become highly successful club players for Liverpool, though their international careers were largely disappointing. In 1992, Souness had also brought in [[David James (footballer, born 1970)|David James]] as an eventual successor to [[Bruce Grobbelaar]] (who finally left in 1994), and although James' fortunes at Anfield were mixed, he later went on to enjoy better fortunes elsewhere and was still keeping goal for England at the end of the following decade as he approached his 40th birthday.\n\nSouness later claimed in his autobiography ''The Management Years'' that he faced an uphill struggle from day one for a number of reasons. The majority of key players were around or over age 30, such as Ian Rush, John Barnes, Peter Beardsley, Steve McMahon, Ray Houghton, Jan Molby, Ronnie Whelan, Steve Nicol and Bruce Grobbelaar, many of whom had testimonials during his time in charge. He knew they had eventually to be replaced and he doubted some of their desire. He claims in his book the senior players also appeared not to want to listen to him and may have resented his disciplinarian approach to their behaviour, and also claimed a number of players \u2013 including Beardsley and McMahon \u2013 asked for improved terms in their contracts or they would move elsewhere.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the end, Beardsley, McMahon and Houghton were sold, seemingly before quality replacements were found and these key components of Kenny Dalglish's last great side were not adequately replaced. Souness claimed Ian Rush and Ray Houghton had also demanded to know why new signings like Mark Wright were earning more money than them, despite not yet having won any trophies.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSouness also claims Liverpool chief executive Peter Robinson at the time had warned him this was a Liverpool team in decline and that they only had one player who was still \"great\", [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]]. Souness was left disappointed by Barnes as he was at this time frequently suffering from injuries, and in particular suffered a ruptured achilles tendon which was to eventually affect his acceleration therefore affecting his playing style, and not giving Souness what he wanted from a vintage Barnes at his peak, which was what he saw as a \"devastating winger with pace and goalscoring touch\". He had also claimed Barnes was once the \"best player in Britain\" but unfortunately only saw flashes of his brilliance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Rumours about squabbles in the dressing room between the players and Souness were rife, with Ian Rush telling a [[Sky Sports]] interviewer that \"teacups being thrown\" were nothing new.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nSouness also fell out with former Liverpool teammates [[Tommy_Smith_(footballer,_born_1945)|Tommy Smith]] and Phil Thompson during his time in charge at Anfield. In his autobiography, Souness said that Thompson, the reserve team manager, was overheard angrily criticising his tactics and purchases behind his back. This was overheard by Manchester United assistant manager [[Brian Kidd]] and relayed to [[Walter Smith]], who was so alarmed by Thompson's behaviour that he drove from Scotland to Liverpool to tell Souness what had been said. Souness dismissed Thompson as a result and the two have remained bitter towards each other since, with Thompson claiming in his own book he would never speak to Souness again as a result.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSouness said he had a number of spats as a Liverpool player with Thompson, including in 1981, when Thompson initially refused to speak to Souness for a while after he lost the captaincy to him; Thompson had accused Souness to his face and in front of the other Liverpool players of \"stealing the captaincy behind his back\". They also had an argument and physical fight which took place after Thompson had accused Souness of marrying his first wife Danielle only because she was wealthy. Souness believed these incidents may have contributed to Thompson's hostility and disrespect of him.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Tommy Smith had been strongly criticising Souness in the local media at the time, and he had been caught mixing with the players and some of the coaches at Anfield despite no longer having an official position at the club. Souness banned Smith from the club areas, and said that in his last phone call with Tommy Smith, instructing him not to hang around the official club areas, he was certain he had \"made an enemy for life\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Galatasaray===\nAfter leaving Liverpool, Souness was out of work for over a year, despite reports at the end of the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394 season]] linking him with a return to Middlesbrough, this time as a manager, a job which went to [[Bryan Robson]] instead.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-lawrence-leaves-middlesbrough-1433290.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Phil | last=Shaw | title=Football: Lawrence leaves Middlesbrough | date=3 May 1994}}</ref>\n\nSouness went to manage [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in Turkey in June 1995, and again managed to court controversy with local issues, nearly sparking a riot after placing a large Galatasaray flag into the centre circle of the pitch of arch rivals [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football)|Fenerbah\u00e7e]] after Galatasaray had beaten them in the [[Turkish Cup]] final on 24 April 1996. The iconic image of the victor planting the flag drew comparisons with Turkish hero [[Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan]], who was killed as he planted the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] flag at the end of the [[Siege of Constantinople]]. This earned Souness the nickname \"Ulubatl\u0131 Souness\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ulubatli Souness (In Turkish) |publisher=cimbombom.8k.com |url=http://www.cimbombom.8k.com/ulubatli.html |accessdate=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622184920/http://www.cimbombom.8k.com/ulubatli.html |archivedate=22 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Southampton===\nSouness then returned to England to manage [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], but after one season he resigned, citing differences with chairman [[Rupert Lowe]].

Souness did not check any of Dia's credentials as a good player, which proved to be a hoax instigated by Dia's agent (who had made the initial call).

The Scottish manager brought several British players from the Premier League, including defenders [[Steve Harkness]] and [[Gary Charles]], midfielders [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] and [[Mark Pembridge]] and forwards [[Dean Saunders]] and [[Brian Deane]], as well as refusing to sign emerging talent [[Deco]]. One-and-a-half years later, Souness left the club and stated, \"Vale e Azevedo lies when he looks in the eyes.

During his four-year spell at Blackburn, he initially got the very best out of talented youngsters such as [[Damien Duff]], [[David Dunn]] and [[Matt Jansen]]; brought [[Henning Berg]] back to the club and signed big name players like [[Andy Cole]], [[Tugay Kerimo\u011flu]], [[Brad Friedel]] and [[Dwight Yorke]]. Cole and Jansen scored in Blackburn's 2\u20131 League Cup victory over Tottenham Hotspur in 2002.\n\nSouness then guided Blackburn to a top-six finish before a disappointing final season in [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304]] in which the club struggled, although they avoided relegation. After less than one month of the following season, many Blackburn fans had begun to express grave doubts in Souness' handling of the club. His authoritarian methods had led to the alienation or departure of Yorke, Cole, Dunn, Berg and [[Keith Gillespie]].\n\nAlthough Souness could not be blamed for the long-term loss of Matt Jansen to a motorbike accident or Damien Duff's departure to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]17&nbsp;million, these players were not sufficiently replaced in the transfer market. [[Vratislav Gre\u0161ko]], [[Lorenzo Amoruso]] and \u00a36.75&nbsp;million signing [[Corrado Grabbi]] were all flops for Blackburn, while [[Steven Reid]] and [[Brett Emerton]] were also disappointing, although they both improved for Blackburn after Souness' departure.\n\n===Newcastle United===\nSouness left Blackburn in 2004 to become manager of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Souness takes Newcastle job |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/3630952.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=6 September 2004 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite a promising start to his role with results back to back, Souness quickly fell out with a number of players, including [[Wales national football team|Welsh international]] [[Craig Bellamy]], who left the club to join Souness' former employers, Blackburn, after being farmed out on loan to Celtic. [[Laurent Robert]], [[Olivier Bernard]] and [[Jermaine Jenas]] are also believed to have left the club on bad terms with Souness. The club finished 14th in the league and despite making it to the quarter-finals of the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] and the semi-finals of the [[2004\u201305 FA Cup|FA Cup]], Souness found himself under mounting pressure from ''Toon'' supporters.\n\nNewcastle began the [[2005\u201306 Newcastle United F.C. season|2005\u201306 season]] in poor form, but Souness was hoping that the purchase of [[Michael Owen]] from Real Madrid on 30 August for an estimated club-record fee of \u00a317&nbsp;million would help to turn the club's fortunes around. Newcastle recorded a win in the [[Tyne-Wear derby]] against Sunderland (3\u20132), and went on to win their next three matches, keeping three clean sheets. Souness seemed to be tightening up Newcastle in defence, with six clean sheets in Newcastle's first 12 games of the season, as many as the whole of the preceding campaign. His decision to reunite the former England striker duo [[Alan Shearer]] and Michael Owen initially appeared shrewd. However, to Souness' and the club's misfortune, Owen cracked the fifth metatarsal of his right foot when he clashed with England teammate [[Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1979)|Paul Robinson]] during a 2\u20130 defeat at Tottenham on 30 December 2005 and was out of action for three months, adding to the club's injury woes.\n\nCriticism of Souness' apparent lack of long-term planning, centred on a threadbare squad, and a consequent vulnerability to injury. Expensive signings \u2013 such as [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] for \u00a38&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite news |title=Magpies complete Boumsong signing |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/4119197.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=2 January 2005 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref> and [[Albert Luque]] for \u00a310&nbsp;million \u2013 failed to make an impression. By the beginning of February 2006, Newcastle United were placed 15th in the Premier League table and sliding dangerously towards a relegation battle, despite the spending of \u00a350&nbsp;million since Souness' arrival. On 2 February 2006, Souness was sacked as manager by chairman [[Freddy Shepherd]] and replaced by United's Youth Academy Director [[Glenn Roeder]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/02/newsstory.sport13 |title=Newcastle sack Souness |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=2 February 2006 |accessdate=26 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the club's DVD season review for the 2005\u201306 season, goalkeeper [[Shay Given]] and defender [[Robbie Elliott]] acknowledged Souness was under pressure at the club as a result of injuries to the squad and admitted some players were to blame for their lack of all-round effort, but also admitted there was a bad atmosphere at the training ground, with Souness seeming to favour some players over others. Alan Shearer acknowledged the fans never really accepted Souness, as well as several injuries being instrumental in damaging the team's confidence. Chairman Freddy Shepherd declared it was the team's formation and loss against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] that prompted his decision to sack Souness.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000FA578K Newcastle United \u2013 Season Review 2005/2006 on www.amazon.co.uk]</ref>\n\n===Stevens inquiry===\nIn the report of the [[2006 allegations of corruption in English football#Stevens report|Stevens inquiry]] into football corruption published in June 2007, Souness was criticised for an apparent lack of consistency:{{cquote|There remains inconsistencies in evidence provided by Graeme Souness \u2013 a former manager of the club \u2013 and [[Kenneth Shepherd]] \u2013 apparently acting in an undefined role but not as a club official \u2013 as to their respective roles in transfer negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|title=What Stevens said about each club |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 June 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=A1YourView&xml=/sport/2007/06/16/sfnste116.xml |accessdate=17 June 2007 |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228065435/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS |archivedate=28 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/15/newsstory.boltonwanderers|title=Stevens names and shames 17 transfers in bungs inquiry|first=James|last=Dart|newspaper=Guardian|date=15 June 2007|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>}}Souness issued a statement denying any wrongdoing:{{cquote|\"I cannot understand why my name features in this report.

He also played for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]].\n\nSouness' managerial career began when he joined Rangers, leading them to three [[List of Scottish football champions|Scottish titles]] and four league cups, before joining Liverpool as manager. He went on to become manager of [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Torino F.C.|Torino]], [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\n==Playing career==\n===Early career===\nSouness was brought up in the [[Saughton]] Mains area of [[Edinburgh]], and supported local side [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/4371828.stm |title=Pulling at Hearts' strings |first=Clive |last=Lindsay |work=BBC Sport |date=24 October 2005 |accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref> and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Focus on Graeme Souness from Shoot! 1986 |url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/617|publisher=LFC History|accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref> As a teenager, Souness played for local boys' club [[Shandon, Edinburgh|North Merchiston]].\n\nSouness' career began as an apprentice at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] under [[Bill Nicholson (footballer)|Bill Nicholson]]. He signed professional forms as a 15-year-old in 1968. Frustrated at a lack of first-team opportunities, the teenage Souness reputedly informed Nicholson he was the best player at the club. Souness made one first-team appearance for Spurs, in a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] tie as a substitute.\n\nDuring the summer of 1972, Souness played in the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|North American Soccer League]] for the [[Montreal Olympique]]. He appeared in 10 of his team's 14 matches and was named in the league's All-Star team for that season.\n\n===Middlesbrough===\nSpurs sold Souness to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] for \u00a330,000 in 1972. He made his first appearance for Middlesbrough on 6 January 1973 in a 2\u20131 league defeat to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] at [[Craven Cottage]]. His first goal came on 11 December 1973 in a 3\u20130 league victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] at [[Ayresome Park]].\n\nSouness' tenacious style began to garner acclaim during his time at Middlesbrough. His first season saw Middlesbrough finish fourth, two places and 14 points short of promotion. [[Jack Charlton]] was appointed Middlesbrough manager, his first managerial post, in May 1973. One of Charlton's first signings was experienced former [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] midfielder [[Bobby Murdoch]], a fellow Scot whom Souness later cited as an important influence in the development of his playing style.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/1332240.stm |title=Bobby Murdoch: An obituary |work=BBC Sport |date=15 May 2001 |accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref> Promotion as champions of the [[Football League Division Two|Second Division]] followed in [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374]]. Souness' influence was demonstrated when he scored a [[hat-trick]] in the season's final fixture, an 8\u20130 victory over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].\n\n===Liverpool===\nSouness' playing career is best remembered for his seven seasons at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], where he won five [[Football League First Division#Winners he ran up the fieldst Division (1889-1992)|League Championships]], three [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]s and four [[EFL Cup|League Cups]].\n\nSouness' time at [[Anfield]] began in January 1978 as a replacement for veteran [[Ian Callaghan]]. After winning his first [[1976\u201377 European Cup|European Cup]] in 1977, Liverpool manager [[Bob Paisley]] sought reinforcements by signing three Scottish players, all of whom were to contribute substantially to further success. Central defender [[Alan Hansen]] arrived from [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] for \u00a3110,000. [[Kenny Dalglish]] \u2013 an established Scottish international \u2013 signed from [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] for a then British record fee of \u00a3440,000. Souness formed the final part of the Scottish triumvirate, leaving Middlesbrough in acrimonious circumstances for a club-record fee of \u00a3350,000 on 10 January 1978.<ref>[http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/415 lfchistory.net Player Profile]</ref>\n\nSouness' Liverpool debut came in a 1\u20130 league victory over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at [[The Hawthorns]] on 14 January 1978. His first goal \u2013 a volley from just inside the penalty box, eventually awarded fans' goal of the season \u2013 came in a 3\u20131 win over bitter rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at Anfield on 25 February 1978.\n\nSouness played a critical role in Liverpool's retention of the [[1977\u201378 European Cup|European Cup]] against [[Club Brugge KV|FC Bruges]] in [[1978 European Cup Final|1978]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], providing the pass for Kenny Dalglish to score the match's only goal.\n\nSustained success followed. Souness's first League title medals were won in seasons [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]] and [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]]. A second [[1980\u201381 European Cup|European Cup]] medal for Souness arrived in [[1981 European Cup Final|1981]] with a 1\u20130 victory over [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] \u2013 the culmination of a campaign in which Souness scored a hat-trick in the quarter-final against [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]].\n\nThis burst of success prompted Paisley to award Souness the club captaincy for season [[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]], to the chagrin of the incumbent [[Phil Thompson]] who had made some errors that season and with whom Paisley had a vicious row during one match at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].<ref name=\"amazon.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0002181347 |title=No Half Measures: Amazon.co.uk: Graeme Souness, Bob Harris: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date=28 March 1985 |accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref> Thompson initially refused to speak to Souness, claiming he had \"stolen the captaincy\" from behind his back.

For the trophy award presentation after the 2\u20131 win over Manchester United in [[1983 Football League Cup Final|1983]], Souness stepped back and insisted that Paisley collect the trophy, it being the manager's retirement season.\n\nIn [[1983\u201384 in English football|1983\u201384]], Souness lifted three trophies. He scored the winning goal in the 1984 League Cup final replay at [[Maine Road]] against Merseyside rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], the first [[Merseyside derby|all-Merseyside]] cup final.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1122702/Liverpool-v-Everton--Sportsmails-10-Merseyside-derbies.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Laura | last=Williamson | title=Liverpool v Everton \u2013 Sportsmail's top 10 Merseyside derbies | date=19 January 2009}}</ref> Liverpool won the league title for the third consecutive season and reached the 1984 [[1983\u201384 European Cup|European Cup]] [[1984 European Cup Final|final]] after beating Romanian champions [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] in the semi-final 3\u20131 on aggregate.

Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] for a fee of \u00a3650,000. Souness and England international [[Trevor Francis]] \u2013 a player at the [[Genoa]]-based club since 1982 \u2013 added experience to an emerging group of future [[Italy national football team|Italian internationals]], including [[Roberto Mancini]], [[Pietro Vierchowod]] and [[Gianluca Vialli]]. In his first season, Sampdoria won the [[Coppa Italia]] with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Serie A]] rivals [[A.C.

He made 73 appearances in total for Rangers (50 in the league), scoring three goals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/rangers/player.php?playerid=1367 |title=Rangers player Graeme Souness|publisher=Fitbastats.com|accessdate=16 April 2017}}</ref> before retiring as a player in 1991 at age 38. His final appearance as a player was at Ibrox in a 2\u20130 victory over [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] in Rangers' last home match of the [[1989\u201390 Scottish Premier Division|1989\u201390 season]], when he brought himself on for the final 20 minutes.\n\n===International===\nWhile a Middlesbrough player, Souness received his first international [[International cap|cap]] for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] on 30 October 1974 in a 3\u20130 friendly victory over [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]] at [[Hampden Park]].<ref name = \"scotland\"/> By the time Souness was selected by manager [[Ally McLeod]] for the Scotland squad for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] in Argentina, he had been awarded only six caps. His move to Liverpool increased his profile. Souness missed Scotland's firs two matches, a defeat to [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and a draw with [[Iran national football team|Iran]], due to injury. He was selected for the final group match against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. Souness contributed to a 3\u20132 victory that nevertheless saw Scotland eliminated from the tournament on goal difference.<ref name = \"my world cup\"/>\n\nSouness played in two further World Cups. The first, in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] in Spain, saw Souness play all three group stage matches.

Souness' appointment as Rangers' manager garnered most attention, but his arrival as a player was also of significance. Souness arrived at Ibrox with a reputation as one of Europe's leading midfielders, a view evidenced by his success at Liverpool and, to a lesser extent, with Sampdoria. His signing was unusual in that Scottish clubs had rarely been able to sign top-quality internationals, including Scots, from other leagues.<ref name=\"revolution\"/>\n\nWhat came popularly to be termed the \"Souness Revolution\" began with a slew of major signings from English clubs. Significantly, this reversed the historic pattern of Scotland's most able footballers playing in England. Souness' first season saw the arrival of players such as [[Terry Butcher]], captain of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and an established [[England national football team|England international]], and [[Chris Woods]] of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], England's second-choice goalkeeper. Subsequent seasons saw the arrival of other English internationals, such as [[Trevor Steven]], [[Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1963)|Gary Stevens]], [[Trevor Francis]] and [[Ray Wilkins]]. Souness was able to offer the lure of European club competition, at a time \u2013 1985\u20131990 \u2013 when English clubs were banned from Europe in the wake of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Rangers profited from this by embarking upon a signing policy which drew on their relative wealth to compete, for the first time, directly with England's most powerful clubs.\n\nSouness' revitalised Rangers quickly began to dominate Scottish football. In his first season, [[1986\u201387 in Scottish football|1986\u201387]], they won the Championship and the League Cup, defeating Celtic 2\u20131 in the final. They retained the League Cup in 1987-88, defeating Aberdeen on penalties after extra-time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19871026&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date=26 October 1987 |page=9 |title=Spot-on Rangers earn the cheers |first=Jim |last=Reynolds |accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref> Two more Championships were to follow, this time in successive seasons ([[1988\u201389 in Scottish football|1988\u201389]] and [[1989\u201390 in Scottish football|1989\u201390]]), and a further two League Cup victories, over Aberdeen 3\u20132 in 1988\u201389 and Celtic 2\u20131 (after extra time) in [[1990\u201391 in Scottish football|1990\u201391]].<ref>{{cite news|title=1990/91 - Rangers 2-1 Celtic (aet)|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/7943599.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=9 December 2018}}</ref> In 1991, Souness left Rangers to take over as manager of Liverpool.

His most noteworthy act was the controversial signing of [[Mo Johnston]] in 1989. Rangers, historically a team supported by [[Protestant]]s, had for most of the 20th century [[Rangers F.C. signing policy|a policy]] of refusing to sign [[Roman Catholic]]s.

He made a major reorganisation of the squad for the following season, bringing in [[Dean Saunders]] for an English record of \u00a32.9&nbsp;million as well as defenders [[Mark Wright (footballer, born 1963)|Mark Wright]] and [[Rob Jones (footballer, born 1971)|Rob Jones]] and midfielder [[Mark Walters]]. He also gave a regular place in the team to 19-year-old midfielder [[Steve McManaman]], whose debut had come under Dalglish in December 1990, and near the end of that campaign, he gave a professional contract to youth team striker [[Robbie Fowler]].\n\nDuring the early stages of the [[1991\u201392 Liverpool F.C. season|1991\u201392 season]], Liverpool were looking like serious title contenders, but it soon became an effective two-horse race between [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Leeds eventually took the title, while Liverpool came sixth. They returned to European competition that season after six years of isolation following the [[Heysel disaster]] of 1985, and reached the [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup quarter-finals]], where they were eliminated by [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].\n\nSouness had major [[heart surgery]] in April 1992. A controversy arose after the [[1991\u201392 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-final against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], which Liverpool needed a replay and penalties to win.

Just after the start of the season, he sold [[Dean Saunders]] to Aston Villa. While Saunders was a key player in Villa's near-successful title challenge, his successor [[Paul Stewart (footballer, born 1964)|Paul Stewart]] proved to be perhaps the biggest flop to play under Souness at Liverpool, scoring just 1 league goal from 32 appearances over the next two seasons and missing many games through injury. Top scorer [[Ian Rush]] was having a difficult time getting goals, and Liverpool spent most of the season in the bottom half of the table. They entered March still only in 15th place, but an excellent final quarter of the season, in which Rush scored 11 Premier League goals, saw them finish sixth.\n\nThe fans were running out of patience with Souness, but he made one last attempt at revitalising Liverpool by signing defender [[Julian Dicks]] and striker [[Nigel Clough]] for the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394 season]]. The season began well enough, but a dismal run of form in early winter effectively ended hopes of the [[Premier League]] title and Souness resigned as Liverpool manager at the end of January 1994 when Liverpool had suffered a shock [[1993\u201394 FA Cup|FA Cup]] exit at the hands of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. He was succeeded by coach [[Roy Evans]].\n\nSouness' reign as Liverpool manager was not remembered with fondness by the club's fans, though there were some positive events. Apart from guiding them to FA Cup success in 1992, he also oversaw the breakthrough of three young players who would go on to be a key part in Liverpool's better performances over the next five years \u2013 Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler and [[Jamie Redknapp]], allowing them to play and develop in the first team where they went on to become highly successful club players for Liverpool, though their international careers were largely disappointing. In 1992, Souness had also brought in [[David James (footballer, born 1970)|David James]] as an eventual successor to [[Bruce Grobbelaar]] (who finally left in 1994), and although James' fortunes at Anfield were mixed, he later went on to enjoy better fortunes elsewhere and was still keeping goal for England at the end of the following decade as he approached his 40th birthday.\n\nSouness later claimed in his autobiography ''The Management Years'' that he faced an uphill struggle from day one for a number of reasons. The majority of key players were around or over age 30, such as Ian Rush, John Barnes, Peter Beardsley, Steve McMahon, Ray Houghton, Jan Molby, Ronnie Whelan, Steve Nicol and Bruce Grobbelaar, many of whom had testimonials during his time in charge. He knew they had eventually to be replaced and he doubted some of their desire. He claims in his book the senior players also appeared not to want to listen to him and may have resented his disciplinarian approach to their behaviour, and also claimed a number of players \u2013 including Beardsley and McMahon \u2013 asked for improved terms in their contracts or they would move elsewhere.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the end, Beardsley, McMahon and Houghton were sold, seemingly before quality replacements were found and these key components of Kenny Dalglish's last great side were not adequately replaced. Souness claimed Ian Rush and Ray Houghton had also demanded to know why new signings like Mark Wright were earning more money than them, despite not yet having won any trophies.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSouness also claims Liverpool chief executive Peter Robinson at the time had warned him this was a Liverpool team in decline and that they only had one player who was still \"great\", [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]]. Souness was left disappointed by Barnes as he was at this time frequently suffering from injuries, and in particular suffered a ruptured achilles tendon which was to eventually affect his acceleration therefore affecting his playing style, and not giving Souness what he wanted from a vintage Barnes at his peak, which was what he saw as a \"devastating winger with pace and goalscoring touch\". He had also claimed Barnes was once the \"best player in Britain\" but unfortunately only saw flashes of his brilliance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Rumours about squabbles in the dressing room between the players and Souness were rife, with Ian Rush telling a [[Sky Sports]] interviewer that \"teacups being thrown\" were nothing new.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nSouness also fell out with former Liverpool teammates [[Tommy_Smith_(footballer,_born_1945)|Tommy Smith]] and Phil Thompson during his time in charge at Anfield. In his autobiography, Souness said that Thompson, the reserve team manager, was overheard angrily criticising his tactics and purchases behind his back. This was overheard by Manchester United assistant manager [[Brian Kidd]] and relayed to [[Walter Smith]], who was so alarmed by Thompson's behaviour that he drove from Scotland to Liverpool to tell Souness what had been said. Souness dismissed Thompson as a result and the two have remained bitter towards each other since, with Thompson claiming in his own book he would never speak to Souness again as a result.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSouness said he had a number of spats as a Liverpool player with Thompson, including in 1981, when Thompson initially refused to speak to Souness for a while after he lost the captaincy to him; Thompson had accused Souness to his face and in front of the other Liverpool players of \"stealing the captaincy behind his back\". They also had an argument and physical fight which took place after Thompson had accused Souness of marrying his first wife Danielle only because she was wealthy. Souness believed these incidents may have contributed to Thompson's hostility and disrespect of him.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Tommy Smith had been strongly criticising Souness in the local media at the time, and he had been caught mixing with the players and some of the coaches at Anfield despite no longer having an official position at the club. Souness banned Smith from the club areas, and said that in his last phone call with Tommy Smith, instructing him not to hang around the official club areas, he was certain he had \"made an enemy for life\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Galatasaray===\nAfter leaving Liverpool, Souness was out of work for over a year, despite reports at the end of the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394 season]] linking him with a return to Middlesbrough, this time as a manager, a job which went to [[Bryan Robson]] instead.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-lawrence-leaves-middlesbrough-1433290.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Phil | last=Shaw | title=Football: Lawrence leaves Middlesbrough | date=3 May 1994}}</ref>\n\nSouness went to manage [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in Turkey in June 1995, and again managed to court controversy with local issues, nearly sparking a riot after placing a large Galatasaray flag into the centre circle of the pitch of arch rivals [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football)|Fenerbah\u00e7e]] after Galatasaray had beaten them in the [[Turkish Cup]] final on 24 April 1996. The iconic image of the victor planting the flag drew comparisons with Turkish hero [[Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan]], who was killed as he planted the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] flag at the end of the [[Siege of Constantinople]]. This earned Souness the nickname \"Ulubatl\u0131 Souness\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ulubatli Souness (In Turkish) |publisher=cimbombom.8k.com |url=http://www.cimbombom.8k.com/ulubatli.html |accessdate=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622184920/http://www.cimbombom.8k.com/ulubatli.html |archivedate=22 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Southampton===\nSouness then returned to England to manage [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], but after one season he resigned, citing differences with chairman [[Rupert Lowe]]. Souness is perhaps best remembered at Southampton for signing Senegalese player [[Ali Dia (footballer)|Ali Dia]], supposedly on the recommendation of former [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] and former [[Liberia national football team|Liberian]] [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[George Weah]]. Souness did not check any of Dia's credentials as a good player, which proved to be a hoax instigated by Dia's agent (who had made the initial call). When Dia made his sole appearance in the Premier League, as a substitute for [[Matt Le Tissier]], he performed amazingly poorly and was substituted.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number \u2013 A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last= Holley |first= Duncan |author2= Chalk, Gary | publisher=Hagiology Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=0-9534474-3-X|pages=248 & 504}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2008/nov/22/southampton-championship|title=The one-off who played for Southampton|date=|work=Guardian |accessdate=3 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://journaloffailure.wordpress.com/2013/10/15/the-legend-of-ali-dia/ |title=The Journal of Failure |work=The Legend of Ali Dia |accessdate=24 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212085820/http://journaloffailure.wordpress.com/2013/10/15/the-legend-of-ali-dia/ |archivedate=12 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Saints'' managed to avoid relegation from the Premier League in Souness' only season as manager, finishing 16th, but he resigned towards the end of May 1997.

When he arrived, it was clear he would have no say in what players he could buy or sell, as the club's owner made those decisions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Souness lasted just four months before being dismissed.\n\n===Benfica===\nIn 1997, Souness was signed by [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]'s new chairman [[Jo\u00e3o Vale e Azevedo]], who promised to return the club to its former glory. The Scottish manager brought several British players from the Premier League, including defenders [[Steve Harkness]] and [[Gary Charles]], midfielders [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] and [[Mark Pembridge]] and forwards [[Dean Saunders]] and [[Brian Deane]], as well as refusing to sign emerging talent [[Deco]]. One-and-a-half years later, Souness left the club and stated, \"Vale e Azevedo lies when he looks in the eyes. Be careful, this man is dangerous.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/quando-moller-nielsen-ficou-as-portas-do-benfica|title=A noite em que M\u00f6ller-Nielsen ficou \u00e0s portas do Benfica|last=Madureira|first=Nuno|date=14 February 2014|website=Maisfutebol|language=pt|trans-title=The night that M\u00f6ller-Nielsen almost joined Benfica|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Donn|first=Natasha|date=12 July 2019|title=Vale e Azevedo tries to officially dodge 10-year jail term for embezzlement of Benfica's millions|url=https://www.portugalresident.com/2019/07/12/vale-e-azevedo-tries-to-officially-dodge-10-year-jail-term-for-embezzlement-of-benficas-millions/|work=Portugal Resident|access-date=12 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Blackburn Rovers===\nSouness then became manager of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], earning promotion back to the Premier League in his first full season. During his four-year spell at Blackburn, he initially got the very best out of talented youngsters such as [[Damien Duff]], [[David Dunn]] and [[Matt Jansen]]; brought [[Henning Berg]] back to the club and signed big name players like [[Andy Cole]], [[Tugay Kerimo\u011flu]], [[Brad Friedel]] and [[Dwight Yorke]]. Cole and Jansen scored in Blackburn's 2\u20131 League Cup victory over Tottenham Hotspur in 2002.\n\nSouness then guided Blackburn to a top-six finish before a disappointing final season in [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304]] in which the club struggled, although they avoided relegation. After less than one month of the following season, many Blackburn fans had begun to express grave doubts in Souness' handling of the club. His authoritarian methods had led to the alienation or departure of Yorke, Cole, Dunn, Berg and [[Keith Gillespie]].\n\nAlthough Souness could not be blamed for the long-term loss of Matt Jansen to a motorbike accident or Damien Duff's departure to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]17&nbsp;million, these players were not sufficiently replaced in the transfer market. [[Vratislav Gre\u0161ko]], [[Lorenzo Amoruso]] and \u00a36.75&nbsp;million signing [[Corrado Grabbi]] were all flops for Blackburn, while [[Steven Reid]] and [[Brett Emerton]] were also disappointing, although they both improved for Blackburn after Souness' departure.\n\n===Newcastle United===\nSouness left Blackburn in 2004 to become manager of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Souness takes Newcastle job |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/3630952.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=6 September 2004 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite a promising start to his role with results back to back, Souness quickly fell out with a number of players, including [[Wales national football team|Welsh international]] [[Craig Bellamy]], who left the club to join Souness' former employers, Blackburn, after being farmed out on loan to Celtic. [[Laurent Robert]], [[Olivier Bernard]] and [[Jermaine Jenas]] are also believed to have left the club on bad terms with Souness. The club finished 14th in the league and despite making it to the quarter-finals of the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] and the semi-finals of the [[2004\u201305 FA Cup|FA Cup]], Souness found himself under mounting pressure from ''Toon'' supporters.\n\nNewcastle began the [[2005\u201306 Newcastle United F.C. season|2005\u201306 season]] in poor form, but Souness was hoping that the purchase of [[Michael Owen]] from Real Madrid on 30 August for an estimated club-record fee of \u00a317&nbsp;million would help to turn the club's fortunes around. Newcastle recorded a win in the [[Tyne-Wear derby]] against Sunderland (3\u20132), and went on to win their next three matches, keeping three clean sheets. Souness seemed to be tightening up Newcastle in defence, with six clean sheets in Newcastle's first 12 games of the season, as many as the whole of the preceding campaign. His decision to reunite the former England striker duo [[Alan Shearer]] and Michael Owen initially appeared shrewd. However, to Souness' and the club's misfortune, Owen cracked the fifth metatarsal of his right foot when he clashed with England teammate [[Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1979)|Paul Robinson]] during a 2\u20130 defeat at Tottenham on 30 December 2005 and was out of action for three months, adding to the club's injury woes.\n\nCriticism of Souness' apparent lack of long-term planning, centred on a threadbare squad, and a consequent vulnerability to injury. Expensive signings \u2013 such as [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] for \u00a38&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite news |title=Magpies complete Boumsong signing |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/4119197.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=2 January 2005 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref> and [[Albert Luque]] for \u00a310&nbsp;million \u2013 failed to make an impression. By the beginning of February 2006, Newcastle United were placed 15th in the Premier League table and sliding dangerously towards a relegation battle, despite the spending of \u00a350&nbsp;million since Souness' arrival. On 2 February 2006, Souness was sacked as manager by chairman [[Freddy Shepherd]] and replaced by United's Youth Academy Director [[Glenn Roeder]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/02/newsstory.sport13 |title=Newcastle sack Souness |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=2 February 2006 |accessdate=26 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the club's DVD season review for the 2005\u201306 season, goalkeeper [[Shay Given]] and defender [[Robbie Elliott]] acknowledged Souness was under pressure at the club as a result of injuries to the squad and admitted some players were to blame for their lack of all-round effort, but also admitted there was a bad atmosphere at the training ground, with Souness seeming to favour some players over others. Alan Shearer acknowledged the fans never really accepted Souness, as well as several injuries being instrumental in damaging the team's confidence. Chairman Freddy Shepherd declared it was the team's formation and loss against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] that prompted his decision to sack Souness.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000FA578K Newcastle United \u2013 Season Review 2005/2006 on www.amazon.co.uk]</ref>\n\n===Stevens inquiry===\nIn the report of the [[2006 allegations of corruption in English football#Stevens report|Stevens inquiry]] into football corruption published in June 2007, Souness was criticised for an apparent lack of consistency:{{cquote|There remains inconsistencies in evidence provided by Graeme Souness \u2013 a former manager of the club \u2013 and [[Kenneth Shepherd]] \u2013 apparently acting in an undefined role but not as a club official \u2013 as to their respective roles in transfer negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|title=What Stevens said about each club |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 June 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=A1YourView&xml=/sport/2007/06/16/sfnste116.xml |accessdate=17 June 2007 |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228065435/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS |archivedate=28 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/15/newsstory.boltonwanderers|title=Stevens names and shames 17 transfers in bungs inquiry|first=James|last=Dart|newspaper=Guardian|date=15 June 2007|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>}}Souness issued a statement denying any wrongdoing:{{cquote|\"I cannot understand why my name features in this report.

If the vote is inconclusive after the first round, three rounds of restricted voting shall take place, followed by three rounds of unrestricted voting, and so on, until a result has been obtained. In restricted voting, only official candidates may be voted on, while in unrestricted voting, any member of the given regional group, with the exception of current Council members, may be voted on.\n\n==Result==\nThe election was managed by then-[[President of the United Nations General Assembly]] [[Edvard Hambro]] of [[Norway]]. The United Nations had 127 member states at this time, with [[Fiji]] being admitted only three days before the election (for a timeline of UN membership, see [[Enlargement of the United Nations]]). There were no nomination prior to the vote. Delegates were to write the names of the five member states they wished elected on the ballot papers. Voting was conducted on a single ballot. Ballots containing more states from a certain region than seats allocated to that region were invalidated.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n|-\n!
