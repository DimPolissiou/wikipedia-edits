(2011) ''Chemistry for Engineering Students'', Brooks/Cole. </ref> and therefore the conversion constant is simply ''N''<sub>A</sub>  = 1.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20B\"></ref> The amount of substance is sometimes referred to as the '''chemical amount'''.\n\nThe mole (symbol \"mol\") is a unit of amount of substance in the [[International System of Units]], defined (since 2019) by fixing the Avogadro constant at the given value.  Historically, the mole was defined as the amount of substance in 12 grams of the carbon-12 isotope. As a consequence, the mass of one mole of a [[chemical compound]], in [[gram]]s, is numerically equal (for all practical purposes) to the mass of one molecule of the compound, in [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s, and the molar mass of an isotope in grams per mole is equal to the mass number. For example, a molecule of water has a mass of about 18.015 daltons on average, whereas a mole of water (which contains {{physconst|NA|unit=no|ref=no}} water molecules) has a total mass of about 18.015 grams.\n\nIn chemistry, because of the [[law of multiple proportions]], it is often much more convenient to work with amounts of substances (that is, number of moles or of molecules) than with masses (grams) or volumes (liters).  For example, the chemical fact \"1 molecule of [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}) will react with 2 molecules of [[hydrogen]] ({{chem|H|2}}) to make 2 molecules of water ({{chem2|H2O}})\" can also be stated as \"1 mole of {{chem2|O2}} will react with 2 moles of {{chem2|H2}} to form 2 moles of water\". The same chemical fact, expressed in terms of masses, would be \"32 g of oxygen will react with approximately 2.0156 g of hydrogen to make approximately 18.0152 g of water\" (and the numbers would depend on the [[isotope|isotopic composition]] of the reagents). In terms of volume, the numbers would depend on the pressure and temperature of the reagents and products.  For the same reasons, the concentrations of reagents and products in solution are often specified in moles per liter, rather than grams per liter.\n\nThe amount of substance is also a convenient concept in [[thermodynamics]].  For example, the pressure of a certain quantity of a [[noble gas]] in a recipient of a given volume, at a given temperature, is directly related to the number of molecules in the gas (through the [[ideal gas law]]), not to its mass.\n\nThis technical sense of the term \"amount of substance\" should not be confused with the general sense of \"amount\" in the [[English language]]. The latter may refer to other measurements such as mass or volume,<ref name=\"Giunta\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00690|title=What's in a Name?

For [[metal]]lic [[chemical element|elements]], and some non-metallic elements like [[carbon]] and [[silicon]] which have molecules of indefinite size, it usually refers to atoms instead.  For element [[allotrope]]s with discrete molecules \u2013 like [[iodine]], {{chem|I|2}}, [[chlorine]], {{chem|Cl|2}}, [[phosphorus|white phosphorus]] {{chem|P|4}}, and [[octasulfur]] {{chem|S|8}} \u2013 the term is ambiguous, and should be clarified.\n\nFor [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] (ionic solids) and for [[polymers]] of indeterminate molecular size, the term usually refers to the number of instances of the conventional chemical formula of the substance.  Thus, for example, 1 mol of [[calcium chloride]] ({{chem|CaCl2}}) is understood to contain one mole of [[calcium]] [[cation]]s {{chem|Ca|2+}} and two moles of [[chloride]] [[anion]]s {{chem|Cl|\u2212}}, even though the ions are not bound into separate three-atom molecules.  Likewise, 1 mol of solid [[silicon dioxide]] ({{chem|SiO|2}})<sub>''n''</sub>, which has a three-dimensional covalent lattice structure, is understood to contain one mole of silicon atoms and two moles of oxygen atoms. \n\nFor substances that normally exist in partially dissociated or polymerized form, the amount of substance usually refers to its nominal formula, without taking those changes into account.  For example, \"a solution of 1 mol of [[formaldehyde]] ({{chem|CH|2|O}}) in water\" is generally understood to contain one mole of carbon atoms, even though some of the formaldehyde may be in the form of [[methanediol]] {{chem|CH|4|O|2}} or [[oligomer]]s like [[paraformaldehyde]] {{chem|H|(|CH|2|O|)|''n''|OH}} and [[1,3,5-trioxane|metaformaldehyde]] {{chem|C|3|H|6|O|3}}.  Note that, because of the latter, the number of carbon-containing ''molecules'' in the solution may be substantially less than one mole.\n\n==Derived quantities==\n===Molar quantities (per mole)===\nThe quotient of some [[extensive property|extensive]] physical quantity of a homogeneous sample by its amount of substance is an [[intensive property]] of the substance, usually named by the prefix '''molar'''.<ref name=\"molar\">{{GreenBookRef|page=7}}</ref> \n\nFor example, the ratio of the mass of a sample by its amount of substance is the [[molar mass]], whose SI unit is kilograms (or, more usually, grams) per mole; which is about 18.015 g/mol for water, and 55.845 g/mol for [[iron]].  From the volume, one gets the [[molar volume]], which is about 17.962 [[milliliter]]/mol for liquid water and 7.092 mL/mol for iron at room temperature.  From the [[heat capacity]], one gets the [[molar heat capacity]], which is about 75.385 [[joule|J]]/[[kelvin|K]]/mol for water and about 25.10 J/K/mol for iron.\n\n===Amount concentration (moles per liter)===\nAnother important derived quantity is the [[amount of substance concentration]]<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=amount-of-substance concentration|file=A00298}}</ref> (also called ''amount concentration'', or ''substance concentration'' in [[clinical chemistry]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry | year = 1996 | title = Glossary of Terms in Quantities and Units in Clinical Chemistry | url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1996/pdf/6804x0957.pdf | journal = [[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl. Chem.]] | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 957\u20131000 | doi=10.1351/pac199668040957| author-link = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry }}</ref>; which is defined as the amount of a specific substance in a sample of a solution (or some other mixture), divided by the volume of the sample.  \n\nThe SI unit of this quantity is the mole (of the substance) per liter (of the solution).  Thus, for example, the amount concentration of [[sodium chloride]] in ocean water is typically about 0.599 mol/L.\n\nThe denominator is the volume of the solution, not of the solvent. Thus, for example, one liter of standard [[vodka]] contains about 0.40 L of [[ethanol]] (315 g, 6.85 mol) and 0.60 L of water. The amount concentration of ethanol is therefore (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(1 L of vodka) = 6.85 mol/L, not (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(0.60 L of water), which would be 11.4 mol/L. \n\nIn chemistry, it is customary to read the unit \"mol/L\" as '''[[molar (unit)|molar]]''', and denote it by the symbol \"M\" (both following the numeric value). Thus, for example, each liter of a \"0.5 molar\" or \"0.5 M\" solution of [[urea]] ({{chem|CH|4|N|2|O}}) in water contains 0.5 moles of that molecule.  By extension, the amount concentration is also commonly called the '''molarity''' of the substance of interest in the solution.  However, as of May 2007, these terms and symbols are not condoned by IUPAC.<ref>{{GreenBookRef|page=42&nbsp;(n.&nbsp;15)}}</ref>\n\nThis quantity should not be confused with the [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]], which is the mass of the substance of interest divided by the volume of the solution (about 35 g/L for sodium chloride in ocean water). \n\n===Amount fraction (moles per mole)===\nConfusingly, the amount concentration, or \"molarity\", should also be distinguished from \"molar concentration\", which should be the number of moles (molecules) of the substance of interest divided by the total number of moles (molecules) in the solution sample.  This quantity is more properly called the [[amount fraction]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Alchemy|alchemists]], and especially the early [[metallurgist]]s, probably had some notion of amount of substance, but there are no surviving records of any generalization of the idea beyond a set of recipes. In 1758, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] questioned the idea that mass was the only measure of the quantity of matter,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Lomonosov | first = Mikhail | authorlink = Mikhail Lomonosov | year = 1970 | contribution = On the Relation of the Amount of Material and Weight | editor-first = Henry M. | editor-last = Leicester | title = Mikhail Vasil'evich Lomonosov on the Corpuscular Theory | contribution-url=//archive.org/stream/mikhailvasilevic017733mbp#page/n239/mode/2up | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Harvard University Press | pages = 224\u201333 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> but he did so only in relation to his theories on [[gravitation]].

Historically, the mole was defined as the amount of substance in 12 grams of the carbon-12 isotope. As a consequence, the mass of one mole of a [[chemical compound]], in [[gram]]s, is numerically equal (for all practical purposes) to the mass of one molecule of the compound, in [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s, and the molar mass of an isotope in grams per mole is equal to the mass number. For example, a molecule of water has a mass of about 18.015 daltons on average, whereas a mole of water (which contains {{physconst|NA|unit=no|ref=no}} water molecules) has a total mass of about 18.015 grams.\n\nIn chemistry, because of the [[law of multiple proportions]], it is often much more convenient to work with amounts of substances (that is, number of moles or of molecules) than with masses (grams) or volumes (liters).  For example, the chemical fact \"1 molecule of [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}) will react with 2 molecules of [[hydrogen]] ({{chem|H|2}}) to make 2 molecules of water ({{chem2|H2O}})\" can also be stated as \"1 mole of {{chem2|O2}} will react with 2 moles of {{chem2|H2}} to form 2 moles of water\". The same chemical fact, expressed in terms of masses, would be \"32 g of oxygen will react with approximately 2.0156 g of hydrogen to make approximately 18.0152 g of water\" (and the numbers would depend on the [[isotope|isotopic composition]] of the reagents). In terms of volume, the numbers would depend on the pressure and temperature of the reagents and products.  For the same reasons, the concentrations of reagents and products in solution are often specified in moles per liter, rather than grams per liter.\n\nThe amount of substance is also a convenient concept in [[thermodynamics]].  For example, the pressure of a certain quantity of a [[noble gas]] in a recipient of a given volume, at a given temperature, is directly related to the number of molecules in the gas (through the [[ideal gas law]]), not to its mass.\n\nThis technical sense of the term \"amount of substance\" should not be confused with the general sense of \"amount\" in the [[English language]]. The latter may refer to other measurements such as mass or volume,<ref name=\"Giunta\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00690|title=What's in a Name?

For [[metal]]lic [[chemical element|elements]], and some non-metallic elements like [[carbon]] and [[silicon]] which have molecules of indefinite size, it usually refers to atoms instead.  For element [[allotrope]]s with discrete molecules \u2013 like [[iodine]], {{chem|I|2}}, [[chlorine]], {{chem|Cl|2}}, [[phosphorus|white phosphorus]] {{chem|P|4}}, and [[octasulfur]] {{chem|S|8}} \u2013 the term is ambiguous, and should be clarified.\n\nFor [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] (ionic solids) and for [[polymers]] of indeterminate molecular size, the term usually refers to the number of instances of the conventional chemical formula of the substance.  Thus, for example, 1 mol of [[calcium chloride]] ({{chem|CaCl2}}) is understood to contain one mole of [[calcium]] [[cation]]s {{chem|Ca|2+}} and two moles of [[chloride]] [[anion]]s {{chem|Cl|\u2212}}, even though the ions are not bound into separate three-atom molecules.  Likewise, 1 mol of solid [[silicon dioxide]] ({{chem|SiO|2}})<sub>''n''</sub>, which has a three-dimensional covalent lattice structure, is understood to contain one mole of silicon atoms and two moles of oxygen atoms. \n\nFor substances that normally exist in partially dissociated or polymerized form, the amount of substance usually refers to its nominal formula, without taking those changes into account.  For example, \"a solution of 1 mol of [[formaldehyde]] ({{chem|CH|2|O}}) in water\" is generally understood to contain one mole of carbon atoms, even though some of the formaldehyde may be in the form of [[methanediol]] {{chem|CH|4|O|2}} or [[oligomer]]s like [[paraformaldehyde]] {{chem|H|(|CH|2|O|)|''n''|OH}} and [[1,3,5-trioxane|metaformaldehyde]] {{chem|C|3|H|6|O|3}}.  Note that, because of the latter, the number of carbon-containing ''molecules'' in the solution may be substantially less than one mole.\n\n==Derived quantities==\n===Molar quantities (per mole)===\nThe quotient of some [[extensive property|extensive]] physical quantity of a homogeneous sample by its amount of substance is an [[intensive property]] of the substance, usually named by the prefix '''molar'''.<ref name=\"molar\">{{GreenBookRef|page=7}}</ref> \n\nFor example, the ratio of the mass of a sample by its amount of substance is the [[molar mass]], whose SI unit is kilograms (or, more usually, grams) per mole; which is about 18.015 g/mol for water, and 55.845 g/mol for [[iron]].  From the volume, one gets the [[molar volume]], which is about 17.962 [[milliliter]]/mol for liquid water and 7.092 mL/mol for iron at room temperature.  From the [[heat capacity]], one gets the [[molar heat capacity]], which is about 75.385 [[joule|J]]/[[kelvin|K]]/mol for water and about 25.10 J/K/mol for iron.\n\n===Amount concentration (moles per liter)===\nAnother important derived quantity is the [[amount of substance concentration]]<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=amount-of-substance concentration|file=A00298}}</ref> (also called ''amount concentration'', or ''substance concentration'' in [[clinical chemistry]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry | year = 1996 | title = Glossary of Terms in Quantities and Units in Clinical Chemistry | url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1996/pdf/6804x0957.pdf | journal = [[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl.

Thus, for example, the amount concentration of [[sodium chloride]] in ocean water is typically about 0.599 mol/L.\n\nThe denominator is the volume of the solution, not of the solvent. Thus, for example, one liter of standard [[vodka]] contains about 0.40 L of [[ethanol]] (315 g, 6.85 mol) and 0.60 L of water. The amount concentration of ethanol is therefore (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(1 L of vodka) = 6.85 mol/L, not (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(0.60 L of water), which would be 11.4 mol/L. \n\nIn chemistry, it is customary to read the unit \"mol/L\" as '''[[molar (unit)|molar]]''', and denote it by the symbol \"M\" (both following the numeric value). Thus, for example, each liter of a \"0.5 molar\" or \"0.5 M\" solution of [[urea]] ({{chem|CH|4|N|2|O}}) in water contains 0.5 moles of that molecule.  By extension, the amount concentration is also commonly called the '''molarity''' of the substance of interest in the solution.  However, as of May 2007, these terms and symbols are not condoned by IUPAC.<ref>{{GreenBookRef|page=42&nbsp;(n.&nbsp;15)}}</ref>\n\nThis quantity should not be confused with the [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]], which is the mass of the substance of interest divided by the volume of the solution (about 35 g/L for sodium chloride in ocean water). \n\n===Amount fraction (moles per mole)===\nConfusingly, the amount concentration, or \"molarity\", should also be distinguished from \"molar concentration\", which should be the number of moles (molecules) of the substance of interest divided by the total number of moles (molecules) in the solution sample.  This quantity is more properly called the [[amount fraction]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Alchemy|alchemists]], and especially the early [[metallurgist]]s, probably had some notion of amount of substance, but there are no surviving records of any generalization of the idea beyond a set of recipes. In 1758, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] questioned the idea that mass was the only measure of the quantity of matter,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Lomonosov | first = Mikhail | authorlink = Mikhail Lomonosov | year = 1970 | contribution = On the Relation of the Amount of Material and Weight | editor-first = Henry M. | editor-last = Leicester | title = Mikhail Vasil'evich Lomonosov on the Corpuscular Theory | contribution-url=//archive.org/stream/mikhailvasilevic017733mbp#page/n239/mode/2up | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Harvard University Press | pages = 224\u201333 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> but he did so only in relation to his theories on [[gravitation]].

A few years after the emergency, however, the supreme court rejected the absoluteness of the 42nd amendment and reaffirmed its power of judicial review in ''[[Minerva Mills v.

Civil and political rights (traditionally protected in the Fundamental Rights chapter of the Indian constitution) have also been expanded and more fiercely protected. These new interpretations have opened the avenue for litigation on a number of important issues.\n\n=== Recent important cases ===\nAmong the important pronouncements of the supreme court post 2000 is the Coelho case I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (Judgment of 11 January 2007). A unanimous bench of 9 judges reaffirmed the ''basic structure'' doctrine. It held that a constitutional amendment which entails violation of any fundamental rights which the court regards as forming part of the ''basic structure'' of the constitution, then the same can be struck down depending upon its impact and consequences. The judgment clearly imposes further limitations on the constituent power of parliament with respect to the principles underlying certain fundamental rights. The judgment in Coelho has in effect restored the decision in Golak Nath regarding non-amendability of the constitution on account of infraction of fundamental rights, contrary to the judgment in the [[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala|''Kesavananda Bharati'' case]].\n\nAnother important decision was of the five-judge bench in ''[[Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India]]''; where the constitutional validity of Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admissions) Act, 2006 was upheld, subject to the \"creamy layer\" criteria.

Our society often ridicules and abuses the Transgender community and in public places like railway stations, bus stands, schools, workplaces, malls, theatres,\nhospitals, they are sidelined and treated as untouchables, forgetting the fact that the moral failure lies in the society's unwillingness to contain or embrace different gender identities and expressions, a mindset which we have to change.</blockquote>\n\nJustice Radhakrishnan said that transgender people should be treated consistently with other minorities under the law, enabling them to access jobs, healthcare and education.<ref>{{cite news|title=India court recognises transgender people as third gender|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-27031180|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=15 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415130906/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-27031180|archive-date=15 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> He framed the issue as one of human rights, saying that, \"These TGs, even though insignificant in numbers, are still human beings and therefore they have every right to enjoy their human rights\", concluding by declaring that:<ref name=\"TGruling\" />\n\n(1) [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijras]], eunuchs, apart from binary gender, be treated as \"third gender\" for the purpose of safeguarding their\nrights under Part III of our constitution and the laws made by the parliament and the State Legislature.\n\n(2) Transgender persons' right to decide their self-identified gender is also upheld and the Centre and State Governments are directed to grant legal recognition of their gender identity such as male, female or as third gender.\n\n==== Relief to over 35,000 public servants ====\nIn B.Prabhakara Rao vs. State of A.P. involved sudden reduction in age of superannuation from 58 years to 55 years of over 35,000 public servants of State Government, public sector undertakings, statutory bodies, educational institutions and Tirupathi-Tirumalai Devasthanams (TTD). They lost first round of litigation in the supreme court. Realising the mistake, fresh legislation was brought restoring the original age of superannuation of 58 years but providing that the benefit of new legislation would not extend to those whose reduction of age of superannuation had been upheld. In challenge to this law, Subodh Markandeya argued that all that was required was to strike down naughty \"not\" \u2013 which found favour with the supreme court bringing relief to over 35,000 public servants.\n\n==== Decriminalisation of homosexuality ====\n\nA five-member constitutional bench decriminalised homosexuality by partially striking down the [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]] in September 2018.

The constitutional rights of imprisoned persons were restricted under preventive detention laws passed by parliament. In the case of Shiva Kant Shukla (''Additional District Magistrate of Jabalpur v.

A few years after the emergency, however, the supreme court rejected the absoluteness of the 42nd amendment and reaffirmed its power of judicial review in ''[[Minerva Mills v.

It is said that the [[basic structure doctrine]], created in ''[[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala]]'', was strengthened in ''Indira Gandhi's'' case and set in stone in ''[[Minerva Mills v.

Civil and political rights (traditionally protected in the Fundamental Rights chapter of the Indian constitution) have also been expanded and more fiercely protected. These new interpretations have opened the avenue for litigation on a number of important issues.\n\n=== Recent important cases ===\nAmong the important pronouncements of the supreme court post 2000 is the Coelho case I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (Judgment of 11 January 2007). A unanimous bench of 9 judges reaffirmed the ''basic structure'' doctrine. It held that a constitutional amendment which entails violation of any fundamental rights which the court regards as forming part of the ''basic structure'' of the constitution, then the same can be struck down depending upon its impact and consequences. The judgment clearly imposes further limitations on the constituent power of parliament with respect to the principles underlying certain fundamental rights. The judgment in Coelho has in effect restored the decision in Golak Nath regarding non-amendability of the constitution on account of infraction of fundamental rights, contrary to the judgment in the [[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala|''Kesavananda Bharati'' case]].\n\nAnother important decision was of the five-judge bench in ''[[Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India]]''; where the constitutional validity of Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admissions) Act, 2006 was upheld, subject to the \"creamy layer\" criteria. Importantly, the court refused to follow the '[[strict scrutiny]]' standards of review followed by the United States supreme court.

Our society often ridicules and abuses the Transgender community and in public places like railway stations, bus stands, schools, workplaces, malls, theatres,\nhospitals, they are sidelined and treated as untouchables, forgetting the fact that the moral failure lies in the society's unwillingness to contain or embrace different gender identities and expressions, a mindset which we have to change.</blockquote>\n\nJustice Radhakrishnan said that transgender people should be treated consistently with other minorities under the law, enabling them to access jobs, healthcare and education.<ref>{{cite news|title=India court recognises transgender people as third gender|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-27031180|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=15 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415130906/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-27031180|archive-date=15 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> He framed the issue as one of human rights, saying that, \"These TGs, even though insignificant in numbers, are still human beings and therefore they have every right to enjoy their human rights\", concluding by declaring that:<ref name=\"TGruling\" />\n\n(1) [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijras]], eunuchs, apart from binary gender, be treated as \"third gender\" for the purpose of safeguarding their\nrights under Part III of our constitution and the laws made by the parliament and the State Legislature.\n\n(2) Transgender persons' right to decide their self-identified gender is also upheld and the Centre and State Governments are directed to grant legal recognition of their gender identity such as male, female or as third gender.\n\n==== Relief to over 35,000 public servants ====\nIn B.Prabhakara Rao vs. State of A.P. involved sudden reduction in age of superannuation from 58 years to 55 years of over 35,000 public servants of State Government, public sector undertakings, statutory bodies, educational institutions and Tirupathi-Tirumalai Devasthanams (TTD). They lost first round of litigation in the supreme court. Realising the mistake, fresh legislation was brought restoring the original age of superannuation of 58 years but providing that the benefit of new legislation would not extend to those whose reduction of age of superannuation had been upheld. In challenge to this law, Subodh Markandeya argued that all that was required was to strike down naughty \"not\" \u2013 which found favour with the supreme court bringing relief to over 35,000 public servants.\n\n==== Decriminalisation of homosexuality ====\n\nA five-member constitutional bench decriminalised homosexuality by partially striking down the [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]] in September 2018. The bench led by [[Dipak Misra]] unanimously declared that criminalisation of private consensual sex between adult persons of the same sex under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was clearly unconstitutional.
