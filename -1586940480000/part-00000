However, in [[quantum physics]], [[organic chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]], the term ''molecule'' is often used less strictly, also being applied to [[polyatomic ion]]s.\n\nIn the [[kinetic theory of gases]], the term ''molecule'' is often used for any gaseous [[particle]] regardless of its composition.

Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of [[chemical bond]]s, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([[bound state]]) composed of two or more [[atom]]s. [[Polyatomic ion]]s may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term ''unstable molecule'' is used for very [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([[Resonance (chemistry)|resonances]]) of electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], molecular [[ion]]s, [[Rydberg molecule]]s, [[transition state]]s, [[van der Waals bonding|van der Waals complexes]], or systems of colliding atoms as in [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]].\n\n== History and etymology ==\n{{Main|History of molecular theory}}\n\nAccording to [[Merriam-Webster]] and the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word \"molecule\" derives from the [[Latin]] \"[[Mole (unit)|moles]]\" or small unit of mass.\n* '''Molecule''' (1794)&nbsp;\u2013 \"extremely minute particle\", from French ''{{linktext|mol\u00e9cule}}'' (1678), from [[New Latin]] ''{{linktext|molecula}}'', diminutive of Latin ''{{linktext|moles}}'' \"mass, barrier\".

Several types of non-metal elements exist only as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as hydrogen molecule.

However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely&nbsp;\u2013 [[dimethyl ether]] has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same [[atom]]s in different arrangements are called [[isomer]]s. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.\n\nThe [[molecular formula]] reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.\n\nThe empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule [[acetylene]] has molecular formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.\n\nThe [[molecular mass]] can be calculated from the [[chemical formula]] and is expressed in conventional [[atomic mass unit]]s equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (<sup>12</sup>[[carbon|C]] [[isotope]]) atom.

[[Infrared spectroscopy]] measures the vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [[functional group]]s in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [[near infrared]] light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.\n\n== Theoretical aspects ==\n\nThe study of molecules by [[molecular physics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]] is largely based on [[quantum mechanic]]s and is essential for the understanding of the [[chemical bond]]. The simplest of molecules is the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]], H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [[one-electron bond]]. H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], which means that the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [[computational chemistry]].\n\nWhen trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it \"must correspond to a depression on the [[potential energy surface]] that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state\".<ref name=\"iupac\" /> This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [[helium]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[helium dimer|He<sub>2</sub>]], which has one vibrational [[bound state]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anderson JB |title=Comment on \"An exact quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the helium-helium intermolecular potential\" [J.

However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and [[Earth core|core of the Earth]], contain many chemical bonds, but are ''not'' made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for [[ionic crystal]]s ([[salt (chemistry)|salts]]) and covalent crystals ([[network solid]]s), although these are often composed of repeating [[unit cell]]s that extend either in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] (such as in [[graphene]]) or three-dimensionally (such as in [[diamond]], [[quartz]], or [[sodium chloride]]). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with [[metallic bond]]ing, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In [[glass]]es (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals.\n\n== Molecular science ==\n\nThe science of molecules is called ''molecular chemistry'' or ''[[molecular physics]]'', depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of [[chemical bond]]s, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([[bound state]]) composed of two or more [[atom]]s. [[Polyatomic ion]]s may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term ''unstable molecule'' is used for very [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([[Resonance (chemistry)|resonances]]) of electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], molecular [[ion]]s, [[Rydberg molecule]]s, [[transition state]]s, [[van der Waals bonding|van der Waals complexes]], or systems of colliding atoms as in [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]].\n\n== History and etymology ==\n{{Main|History of molecular theory}}\n\nAccording to [[Merriam-Webster]] and the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word \"molecule\" derives from the [[Latin]] \"[[Mole (unit)|moles]]\" or small unit of mass.\n* '''Molecule''' (1794)&nbsp;\u2013 \"extremely minute particle\", from French ''{{linktext|mol\u00e9cule}}'' (1678), from [[New Latin]] ''{{linktext|molecula}}'', diminutive of Latin ''{{linktext|moles}}'' \"mass, barrier\".

Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through [[absorbance]] or [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]].<ref name=\"iupac2\">{{GoldBookRef|title=Spectroscopy|file=S05848|accessdate=23 February 2016}}</ref>\nSpectroscopy does not generally refer to [[diffraction]] studies where particles such as [[neutron]]s, [[electron]]s, or high energy [[X-ray]]s interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).\n\n[[Microwave spectroscopy]] commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] measures the vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [[functional group]]s in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [[near infrared]] light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.\n\n== Theoretical aspects ==\n\nThe study of molecules by [[molecular physics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]] is largely based on [[quantum mechanic]]s and is essential for the understanding of the [[chemical bond]]. The simplest of molecules is the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]], H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [[one-electron bond]]. H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], which means that the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [[computational chemistry]].\n\nWhen trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it \"must correspond to a depression on the [[potential energy surface]] that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state\".<ref name=\"iupac\" /> This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [[helium]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[helium dimer|He<sub>2</sub>]], which has one vibrational [[bound state]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anderson JB |title=Comment on \"An exact quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the helium-helium intermolecular potential\" [J.

Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an [[elementary particle]]); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[Atom]]\n* [[Chemical polarity]]\n* [[Covalent bond]]\n* [[Diatomic molecule]]\n* [[List of compounds]]\n* [[List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules]]\n* [[Molecular biology]]\n* [[Molecular design software]]\n* [[Molecular engineering]]\n* [[Molecular geometry]]\n* [[Molecular Hamiltonian]]\n* [[Molecular ion]]\n* [[Molecular modelling]]\n* [[Molecular promiscuity]]\n* [[Molecular orbital]]\n* [[Non-covalent bonding]]\n* [[Periodic systems of small molecules]]\n* [[Small molecule]]\n* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling]]\n* [[Van der Waals molecule]]\n* [[World Wide Molecular Matrix]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Chemistry|Biology|Physics}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikimedia|collapsible=true|c=Category:Molecules|voy=no|wikt=molecule|v=no|n=no|q=Molecule|s=no|b=no|species=no|d=Q11369}}\n* [http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/motm.htm Molecule of the Month{{snds}}School of Chemistry, University of Bristol]\n\n{{Composition}}\n{{Molecules detected in outer space}}\n{{Particles}}\n{{Branches of chemistry}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Molecular physics| ]]\n[[Category:Molecules| ]]\n[[Category:Chemistry]]\n[[Category:Matter]]\n", "name_user": "2601:5c1:380:d610:455f:62d2:8c92:6cea", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Vandalism)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"}

It has been reported to tolerate extreme weather conditions, high winds, and various pests and diseases. It is a pioneer in muddy soil conditions with a PH value of 6.5 to 8, but is intolerant of shade. A number of botanists have proposed division of the species, but currently three subspecies are recognised: \n*''Avicennia marina'' subsp. ''australasica''\n*''Avicennia marina'' subsp.

Rights structure the forms of our governments, the contents of our laws, and the shape of morality as we perceive it.

''What actions or states or objects'' the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. ''Why'' the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. ''How the asserted right can be affected'' by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be kept.<ref name=tws21decgghg/>}}\nThere has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[deontology]], [[logic]], [[political science]], and [[religion]].\n\n===Natural Rights===\n[[File:Brueghel Jan II God creating.jpg|thumb|right|alt=painting of dark gray skies with trees and water, and a human image, flying, with arms outstretched|According to some views, certain rights derive from [[deities]] or [[nature]]]]\n\n* '''Natural rights''' are rights which are \"natural\" in the sense of \"not artificial, not man-made\", as in rights deriving from [[human nature]] or from the [[divine command theory|edicts of a god]]. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural ''right to life''. These are sometimes called ''[[natural and legal rights|moral rights]]'' or ''inalienable rights''.\n\n===Claim versus liberty===\n{{Main|Claim rights and liberty rights}}\n* A '''claim right''' is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the ''claim holder'', such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a ''claim'' to that service or product (another term is ''[[thing in action]]'').<ref name=IEP>Fagan, Andrew. \"Human Rights\". ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH3b</ref> In logic, this idea can be expressed as: \"Person ''A'' has a claim that person ''B'' do something if and only if ''B'' has a duty to ''A'' to do that something.\" Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like \"life, liberty, and property\"; these rights impose an obligation upon others ''not'' to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n* A '''liberty right''' or ''privilege'', in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are ''no obligations'' on other parties to do or not do anything.<ref name=\"IEP\" /> This can be expressed in logic as: \"Person ''A'' has a privilege to do something if and only if ''A'' has no duty not to do that something.\" For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does ''not'' mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though ''other'' rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.\n\nLiberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a ''liberty right'' to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's ''liberty right'' of walking extends precisely to the point where another's ''claim right'' limits his or her freedom.\n\n===Positive versus negative===\n{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}\nIn one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called ''positive rights''. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called ''negative rights''; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the [[United States]], citizens have the ''positive right'' to vote and they have the ''negative right'' to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. [[Australia]], however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]]. Accordingly:\n* '''Positive rights''' are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported \"right to welfare.\"<ref name=tws21decgkfjf/>\n* '''Negative rights''' are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by [[libertarianism|libertarians]] who think of a ''negative right'' as an entitlement to non-interference such as a right against being assaulted.<ref name=tws21decgkfjf>{{cite news\n|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n|quote = A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.\n|publisher = Stanford University\n|date = July 9, 2007\n|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/\n|accessdate = 2009-12-21\n}}</ref>\n\nThough similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with ''active rights'' (which encompass \"privileges\" and \"powers\") and ''passive rights'' (which encompass \"claims\" and \"immunities\").\n\n===Individual versus group===\n{{Main|Individual and group rights}}\nThe general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author [[Ayn Rand]] who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].<ref name=tws18decafafa>{{cite news\n|author = Ayn Rand\n|title = The Virtue of Selfishness: Individual Rights\n|quote = Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual). see page 104. See also: [[Group rights#Objectivist view|Collectivized 'Rights]]\n|publisher = The Ayn Rand Lexicon\n|date = 2009-12-18\n|url = http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html\n|accessdate = 2009-12-18\n}}</ref> However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or ''group rights''.<ref>For a general discussion see. Charles Edward Andrew Lincoln IV, ''Hegelian Dialectical Analysis of U.S. Voting Laws'', 42 U. Dayton L. Rev. 87 (2017).</ref> Accordingly:\n* '''Individual rights''' are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.\n[[File:Malian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers lined up in a row, with green caps, carrying rifles|Do groups have ''rights''? Some argue that when soldiers bond in [[combat]], the group becomes like an organism in itself and has ''rights'' which trump the rights of any individual soldier.]]\n* '''Group rights''' have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having ''rights''. For example, a platoon of soldiers in [[combat]] can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a \"right\" which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience.  But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a [[Trade union|labor union]] can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term \"group\" as well as by the term \"group rights.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nThere can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called [[closed shop]] which has a [[union security agreement]], only the union has a ''right'' to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed \"individual rights\" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the \"group rights\" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.\n\nThe [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]] holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called [[methodological individualism]] and is used by the economists to justify [[individual rights]].\n\n===Other senses===\nOther distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or [[family resemblance]] than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between '''[[civil and political rights]]''' and '''[[economic, social and cultural rights]]''', between which the articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into '''[[three generations of human rights|three generations]]'''. These distinctions have much overlap with that between [[negative and positive rights]], as well as between [[individual rights]] and [[group rights]], but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Man being arrested.jpg|thumb|right|alt=three police officers surround a man in a tee shirt who is handcuffed|In the [[United States]], persons who are going to be questioned by police when they are in police custody must be read their \"Miranda rights\". The [[Miranda warning]] requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney.]]\nRights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.\n\nRights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights.  Issues of concern have historically included [[labor rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], [[reproductive rights]], [[disability rights]], [[patient rights]] and [[prisoners' rights]].  With increasing [[mass surveillance|monitoring]] and the information society, [[digital rights|information rights]], such as the [[right to privacy]] are becoming more important.\n\nSome examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include [[animal rights|animals]],<ref name=tws21decghnnb>{{cite magazine\n|author = Kate Pickert\n|title = Undercover Animal-Rights Investigator\n|quote = One of the most powerful tools animal-rights activists have is the video footage shot inside places like poorly run dog kennels, animal-testing facilities and factory farms, used as grim evidence of the brutality that can take place.

The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a \"right to medical care\" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the \"right to a fair trial\".\n\nFurther, the term ''equality'' which is often bound up with the meaning of \"rights\" often depends on one's political orientation. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and advocates of [[free markets]] often identify equality with [[equality of opportunity]], and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, [[socialism|socialists]] often identify equality with [[equality of outcome]] and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as [[health care]] or [[Welfare|economic assistance]] or [[House|housing]].<ref name=tws21dece563e>{{cite news\n|author = John E.

Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being [[normative ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].\n\nWhile normative ethics addresses such questions as \"What should one do?\", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as \"What ''is'' goodness?\" and \"How can we tell what is good from what is bad?\", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.\n\nRights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of ''what normative ethics is concerned with'' (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics).\nRights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following:\n* Duties ([[deontology]])\n* [[Value (ethics)|Value]] ([[axiology]])\n* Virtue ([[virtue ethics]])\n* Consequences ([[consequentialism]], e.g. [[utilitarianism]])\n\nRights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.\n\n===Criticism===\nSome philosophers have criticised rights as [[ontologically]] dubious entities.  For instance, although in favour of the extension of [[individual rights|individual legal rights]], the [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]], calling them \"nonsense upon stilts\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ross |chapterurl=http://www.utilitarian.net/bentham/about/1995----.htm |chapter=Jeremy Bentham |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |pages=85\u201388 }} Also see {{cite web |last=Sweet |first=William |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/b/bentham.htm |title=Jeremy Bentham |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}</ref> Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of human rights}}\n[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Magna Carta]]'' or \"The Great Charter\" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a [[monarch|king]] to his people to respect certain [[law|legal]] rights.

In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.\n\nHistorically, many notions of rights were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to be respected by his son did not indicate a right of the son to receive something in return for that respect; and the [[divine right of kings]], which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave much possibility for many rights for the subjects themselves.<ref name=tws21decfrre>{{cite news\n|title = Divine Right of Kings\n|quote = [...] the idea that a king was sacred, appointed by God and above the judgment of earthly powers [...] was called the Divine Right of Kings and it entered so powerfully into British culture during the 17th century that it shaped the pomp and circumstance of the Stuart monarchs, imbued the writing of Shakespeare and provoked the political thinking of Milton and Locke.\n|publisher = BBC\n|date = 2007-10-11\n|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20071011.shtml\n|accessdate = 2009-12-21\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn contrast, modern conceptions of rights have often emphasized [[liberty]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]] as among the most important aspects of rights, as was evident in the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions.\n\nImportant documents in the [[political history]] of rights include:\n\n* The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[History of Iran|ancient Iran]] established unprecedented principles of human rights in the 6th century BC under [[Cyrus the Great]].

Some theorists suggest [[civil disobedience]] is, itself, a ''right'', and it was advocated by thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].]]\nThere is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term ''rights''. It has been used by different groups and thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle, beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial.\n\nOne way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many diverse things are claimed as rights: {{cquote|A right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to strike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to operate a forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel proud of what one has done; a right to exist, to sentence an offender to death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to carry a concealed weapon, to a distinct genetic identity; a right to believe one's own eyes, to pronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell in one's own way.<ref name=tws21decgghg>{{cite news\n|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n|quote = Rights dominate most modern understandings of what actions are proper and which institutions are just.

''What actions or states or objects'' the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. ''Why'' the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. ''How the asserted right can be affected'' by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be kept.<ref name=tws21decgghg/>}}\nThere has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[deontology]], [[logic]], [[political science]], and [[religion]].\n\n===Natural Rights===\n[[File:Brueghel Jan II God creating.jpg|thumb|right|alt=painting of dark gray skies with trees and water, and a human image, flying, with arms outstretched|According to some views, certain rights derive from [[deities]] or [[nature]]]]\n\n* '''Natural rights''' are rights which are \"natural\" in the sense of \"not artificial, not man-made\", as in rights deriving from [[human nature]] or from the [[divine command theory|edicts of a god]]. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural ''right to life''. These are sometimes called ''[[natural and legal rights|moral rights]]'' or ''inalienable rights''.\n\n===Claim versus liberty===\n{{Main|Claim rights and liberty rights}}\n* A '''claim right''' is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the ''claim holder'', such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a ''claim'' to that service or product (another term is ''[[thing in action]]'').<ref name=IEP>Fagan, Andrew. \"Human Rights\". ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH3b</ref> In logic, this idea can be expressed as: \"Person ''A'' has a claim that person ''B'' do something if and only if ''B'' has a duty to ''A'' to do that something.\" Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like \"life, liberty, and property\"; these rights impose an obligation upon others ''not'' to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n* A '''liberty right''' or ''privilege'', in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are ''no obligations'' on other parties to do or not do anything.<ref name=\"IEP\" /> This can be expressed in logic as: \"Person ''A'' has a privilege to do something if and only if ''A'' has no duty not to do that something.\" For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does ''not'' mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though ''other'' rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.\n\nLiberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a ''liberty right'' to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's ''liberty right'' of walking extends precisely to the point where another's ''claim right'' limits his or her freedom.\n\n===Positive versus negative===\n{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}\nIn one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called ''positive rights''. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called ''negative rights''; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the [[United States]], citizens have the ''positive right'' to vote and they have the ''negative right'' to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. [[Australia]], however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]]. Accordingly:\n* '''Positive rights''' are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported \"right to welfare.\"<ref name=tws21decgkfjf/>\n* '''Negative rights''' are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by [[libertarianism|libertarians]] who think of a ''negative right'' as an entitlement to non-interference such as a right against being assaulted.<ref name=tws21decgkfjf>{{cite news\n|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n|quote = A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.\n|publisher = Stanford University\n|date = July 9, 2007\n|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/\n|accessdate = 2009-12-21\n}}</ref>\n\nThough similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with ''active rights'' (which encompass \"privileges\" and \"powers\") and ''passive rights'' (which encompass \"claims\" and \"immunities\").\n\n===Individual versus group===\n{{Main|Individual and group rights}}\nThe general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author [[Ayn Rand]] who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].<ref name=tws18decafafa>{{cite news\n|author = Ayn Rand\n|title = The Virtue of Selfishness: Individual Rights\n|quote = Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual). see page 104. See also: [[Group rights#Objectivist view|Collectivized 'Rights]]\n|publisher = The Ayn Rand Lexicon\n|date = 2009-12-18\n|url = http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html\n|accessdate = 2009-12-18\n}}</ref> However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or ''group rights''.<ref>For a general discussion see. Charles Edward Andrew Lincoln IV, ''Hegelian Dialectical Analysis of U.S. Voting Laws'', 42 U. Dayton L. Rev. 87 (2017).</ref> Accordingly:\n* '''Individual rights''' are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.\n[[File:Malian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers lined up in a row, with green caps, carrying rifles|Do groups have ''rights''? Some argue that when soldiers bond in [[combat]], the group becomes like an organism in itself and has ''rights'' which trump the rights of any individual soldier.]]\n* '''Group rights''' have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having ''rights''. For example, a platoon of soldiers in [[combat]] can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a \"right\" which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience.  But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a [[Trade union|labor union]] can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term \"group\" as well as by the term \"group rights.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nThere can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called [[closed shop]] which has a [[union security agreement]], only the union has a ''right'' to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed \"individual rights\" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the \"group rights\" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.\n\nThe [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]] holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called [[methodological individualism]] and is used by the economists to justify [[individual rights]].\n\n===Other senses===\nOther distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or [[family resemblance]] than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between '''[[civil and political rights]]''' and '''[[economic, social and cultural rights]]''', between which the articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into '''[[three generations of human rights|three generations]]'''. These distinctions have much overlap with that between [[negative and positive rights]], as well as between [[individual rights]] and [[group rights]], but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Man being arrested.jpg|thumb|right|alt=three police officers surround a man in a tee shirt who is handcuffed|In the [[United States]], persons who are going to be questioned by police when they are in police custody must be read their \"Miranda rights\". The [[Miranda warning]] requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney.]]\nRights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.\n\nRights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights.  Issues of concern have historically included [[labor rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], [[reproductive rights]], [[disability rights]], [[patient rights]] and [[prisoners' rights]].  With increasing [[mass surveillance|monitoring]] and the information society, [[digital rights|information rights]], such as the [[right to privacy]] are becoming more important.\n\nSome examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include [[animal rights|animals]],<ref name=tws21decghnnb>{{cite magazine\n|author = Kate Pickert\n|title = Undercover Animal-Rights Investigator\n|quote = One of the most powerful tools animal-rights activists have is the video footage shot inside places like poorly run dog kennels, animal-testing facilities and factory farms, used as grim evidence of the brutality that can take place.

The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a \"right to medical care\" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the \"right to a fair trial\".\n\nFurther, the term ''equality'' which is often bound up with the meaning of \"rights\" often depends on one's political orientation. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and advocates of [[free markets]] often identify equality with [[equality of opportunity]], and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, [[socialism|socialists]] often identify equality with [[equality of outcome]] and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as [[health care]] or [[Welfare|economic assistance]] or [[House|housing]].<ref name=tws21dece563e>{{cite news\n|author = John E.

Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being [[normative ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].\n\nWhile normative ethics addresses such questions as \"What should one do?\", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as \"What ''is'' goodness?\" and \"How can we tell what is good from what is bad?\", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.\n\nRights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of ''what normative ethics is concerned with'' (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics).\nRights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following:\n* Duties ([[deontology]])\n* [[Value (ethics)|Value]] ([[axiology]])\n* Virtue ([[virtue ethics]])\n* Consequences ([[consequentialism]], e.g. [[utilitarianism]])\n\nRights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.\n\n===Criticism===\nSome philosophers have criticised rights as [[ontologically]] dubious entities.  For instance, although in favour of the extension of [[individual rights|individual legal rights]], the [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]], calling them \"nonsense upon stilts\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ross |chapterurl=http://www.utilitarian.net/bentham/about/1995----.htm |chapter=Jeremy Bentham |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |pages=85\u201388 }} Also see {{cite web |last=Sweet |first=William |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/b/bentham.htm |title=Jeremy Bentham |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}</ref> Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of human rights}}\n[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Magna Carta]]'' or \"The Great Charter\" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a [[monarch|king]] to his people to respect certain [[law|legal]] rights.

In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.\n\nHistorically, many notions of rights were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to be respected by his son did not indicate a right of the son to receive something in return for that respect; and the [[divine right of kings]], which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave much possibility for many rights for the subjects themselves.<ref name=tws21decfrre>{{cite news\n|title = Divine Right of Kings\n|quote = [...] the idea that a king was sacred, appointed by God and above the judgment of earthly powers [...] was called the Divine Right of Kings and it entered so powerfully into British culture during the 17th century that it shaped the pomp and circumstance of the Stuart monarchs, imbued the writing of Shakespeare and provoked the political thinking of Milton and Locke.\n|publisher = BBC\n|date = 2007-10-11\n|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20071011.shtml\n|accessdate = 2009-12-21\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn contrast, modern conceptions of rights have often emphasized [[liberty]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]] as among the most important aspects of rights, as was evident in the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions.\n\nImportant documents in the [[political history]] of rights include:\n\n* The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[History of Iran|ancient Iran]] established unprecedented principles of human rights in the 6th century BC under [[Cyrus the Great]]. After his conquest of [[Babylon]] in 539 BC, the king issued the [[Cyrus cylinder]], discovered in 1879 and seen by some today as the first human rights document.<ref>{{Cite web|ref=UN-HumanRightsDay|url=https://www.un.org/events/humanrights/2008/history.shtml|title=The First Global Statement of the Inherent Dignity and Equality|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|ref=Lauren|last=Lauren|first=Paul Gordon|authorlink=Paul Gordon Lauren|chapter=Philosophical Visions: Human Nature, Natural Law, and Natural Rights|title=The Evolution of International Human Rights: Visions Seen|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|year=2003|isbn=0-8122-1854-X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|ref=Robertson-Merrills|author1=Robertson, Arthur Henry|author2=Merrills, J.

The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day.

Priests were often also physicians. According to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], while pagan religions seldom offered help to the infirm, the early Christians were willing to nurse the sick and take food to them, notably during the smallpox epidemic of AD 165-180 and the measles outbreak of around AD 250; \"In nursing the sick and dying, regardless of religion, the Christians won friends and sympathisers\".<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 AD, Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, leading to an expansion of the provision of care.

Thus in-patient medical care in the sense of what we today consider a hospital, was an invention driven by Christian mercy and Byzantine innovation.<ref>James Edward McClellan and Harold Dorn, ''Science and Technology in World History: An Introduction'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006), p.99,101.</ref> Byzantine hospital staff included the [[Chief Physician]] (archiatroi), professional nurses (hypourgoi) and orderlies (hyperetai). By the twelfth century, Constantinople had two well-organized hospitals, staffed by doctors who were both male and female. Facilities included systematic treatment procedures and specialized wards for various diseases.<ref>[[Byzantine medicine]]</ref>\n\nIn the early 7th century, Rufaidah bint Sa\u2019ad (also known as Rufaida Al-Aslamia) became what is now described as the first [[Nursing in Islam|Muslim nurse]]. A contemporary of Muhammad, she hailed from the Bani Aslam tribe in Medina and learned her medical skills from her father, a traditional healer. After she had led a group of women to treat injured fighters on the battlefield, Muhammad gave her permission to set up a tent near the Medina mosque to provide treatment and care for the ill and the needy.<ref>[https://blog.nurserecruiter.com/many-centuries-before-florence-nightingale-this-muslim-woman-introduced-nursing-to-the-arabic-world/ \"Many centuries before Florence Nightingale, this Muslim woman introduced nursing to the Arabic world\"]</ref>\n\n==Medieval Europe==\nMedieval hospitals in Europe followed a similar pattern to the [[Byzantine medicine|Byzantine]]. They were religious communities, with care provided by [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s. (An old French term for hospital is ''h\u00f4tel-Dieu'', \"hostel of God.\") Some were attached to monasteries; others were independent and had their own endowments, usually of property, which provided income for their support. Some hospitals were multi-functional while others were founded for specific purposes such as leper hospitals, or as refuges for the poor, or for [[pilgrim]]s: not all cared for the sick. The first Spanish hospital, founded by the Catholic [[Visigoth]] bishop [[Masona]] in 580AD at [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]], was a ''[[xenodochium]]'' designed as an inn for travellers (mostly pilgrims to the shrine of [[Eulalia of M\u00e9rida]]) as well as a hospital for citizens and local farmers. The hospital's endowment consisted of farms to feed its patients and guests. From the account given by Paul the Deacon we learn that this hospital was supplied with physicians and nurses, whose mission included the care the sick wherever they were found, \"slave or free, Christian or Jew.\" <ref>See Florez, \"Espana Sagrada\", XIII, 539; Heusinger, \"Ein Beitrag\", etc. in \"Janus\", 1846, I.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 700s and early 800s, Emperor Charlemagne decreed that those hospitals which had been well conducted before his time and had fallen into decay should be restored in accordance with the needs of the time.<ref name=\"duplex803_iii\">Capitulary Duplex, 803, chapter iii</ref> He further ordered that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery.<ref name=\"duplex803_iii\"/>\n\nDuring the tenth century the monasteries became a dominant factor in hospital work. The famous Benedictine Abbey of Cluny, founded in 910, set the example which was widely imitated throughout France and Germany. Besides its infirmary for the religious, each monastery had a hospital in which externs were cared for. These were in charge of the ''eleemosynarius'', whose duties, carefully prescribed by the rule, included every sort of service that the visitor or patient could require.\n\nAs the eleemosynarius was obliged to seek out the sick and needy in the neighborhood, each monastery became a center for the relief of suffering. Among the monasteries notable in this respect were those of the Benedictines at Corbie in Picardy, Hirschau, Braunweiler, Deutz, Ilsenburg, Liesborn, Pram, and Fulda; those of the Cistercians at Arnsberg, Baumgarten, Eberbach, Himmenrode, Herrnalb, Volkenrode, and Walkenried.\n\nNo less efficient was the work done by the diocesan clergy in accordance with the disciplinary enactments of the councils of Aachen (817, 836), which prescribed that a hospital should be maintained in connection with each collegiate church. The canons were obliged to contribute towards the support of the hospital, and one of their number had charge of the inmates. As these hospitals were located in cities, more numerous demands were made upon them than upon those attached to the monasteries. In this movement the bishop naturally took the lead, hence the hospitals founded by Heribert (d. 1021) in Cologne, Godard (d. 1038) in Hildesheim, Conrad (d. 975) in Constance, and Ulrich (d. 973) in Augsburg. But similar provision was made by the other churches; thus at Trier the hospitals of St. Maximin, St. Matthew, St. Simeon, and St. James took their names from the churches to which they were attached. During the period 1207\u20131577 no less than 155 hospitals were founded in Germany.<ref>Virchow in \"Gesch. Abhandl.\", II</ref>\n\nThe [[Ospedale Maggiore]], traditionally named Ca' Granda (i.e. Big House), in [[Milan]], northern Italy, was constructed to house one of the first community hospitals, the largest such undertaking of the fifteenth century. Commissioned by Francesco Sforza in 1456 and designed by Antonio Filarete it is among the first examples of Renaissance architecture in Lombardy.\n\nThe Normans brought their hospital system along when they conquered England in 1066. By merging with traditional land-tenure and customs, the new charitable houses became popular and were distinct from both English monasteries and French hospitals. They dispensed alms and some medicine, and were generously endowed by the nobility and gentry who counted on them for spiritual rewards after death.<ref>Sethina Watson, \"The Origins of the English Hospital,\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Sixth Series'' (2006) 16:75-94 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25593861 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nAccording to Geoffrey Blainey, the Catholic Church in Europe provided many of the services of a welfare state: \"It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal\". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates.<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Short History of Christianity'' (Penguin Viking; 2011); pp. 214\u201315.</ref>\n\n===Roles for women===\nCatholic women played large roles in health and healing in medieval and early modern Europe.<ref>Mary E.

Arab ideas were later influential in Europe. The famous [[Knights Hospitaller]] arose as a group of individuals associated with an Amalfitan hospital in Jerusalem, which was built to provide care for poor, sick or injured Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. Following the capture of the city by Crusaders, the order became a military as well as infirmarian order.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07477a.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Knights of Malta].

The same theology holds strong into the 21st century. In Catholic areas, the tradition of nursing sisters continued uninterrupted. Several orders of nuns provided nursing services in hospitals.<ref>Colin Jones, ''The Charitable Imperative.

Dinan, ''Women and Poor Relief in Seventeenth-Century France.

For example, in rural [[Brittany]] in France, the [[Daughters of the Holy Spirit]], created in 1706, played a central role. New opportunity for nuns as charitable practitioners were created by devout nobles on their own estates. The nuns provided comprehensive care for the sick poor on their patrons' estates, acting not only as nurses, but took on expanded roles as physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries. The French Catholics in [[New France]] (Canada) and New Orleans continued these traditions. During the French Revolution, most of the orders of nurses were shut down and there was no organized nursing care to replace them.<ref name=\"McHugh\"/> However the demand for their nursing services remained strong, and after 1800 the sisters reappeared and resumed their work in hospitals and on rural estates. They were tolerated by officials because they had widespread support and were the link between elite physicians and distrustful peasants who needed help.<ref>Jacques L\u00e9onard, \"Femmes, Religion et M\u00e9decine: Les Religieuses qui Soignent, en France au XIXe Si\u00e8cle,\" ''Annales: Economies, Societes, Civilisations'' (1977) 32#5 pp. 887\u2013907</ref>\n\n===Protestantism closes the hospitals===\nThe Protestant reformers, led by [[Martin Luther]], rejected the notion that rich men could gain God's grace through good works\u2014and thereby escape purgatory\u2014by providing cash endowments to charitable institutions.

The role had virtually died out centuries before, but was revived in Germany in 1836 when [[Theodor Fliedner]] and his wife Friederike M\u00fcnster opened the first deaconess motherhouse in [[Kaiserswerth]] on the Rhine. The diaconate was soon brought to England and Scandinavia, Kaiserswerth model. The women obligated themselves for 5 years of service, receiving room, board, uniforms, pocket money, and lifelong care. The uniform was the usual dress of the married woman. There were variations, such as an emphasis on preparing women for marriage through training in nursing, child care, social work and housework. In the Anglican Church, the diaconate was an auxiliary to the pastorate, and there were no mother houses. By 1890 there were over 5,000 deaconesses in Protestant Europe, chiefly Germany, Scandinavia, and England. In World War II, diaconates in war zones sustained heavy damage. As eastern Europe fell to communism, most diaconates were shut down, and 7,000 deaconesses became refugees in West Germany. By 1957, in Germany there were 46,000 deaconesses and 10,000 associates. Other countries reported a total of 14,000 deaconesses, most of them Lutherans.

In 1860, the training for the first batch of nurses began; upon graduation from the school, these nurses used to be called 'Nightingales'.<ref name=\"The School for Nurses\">[http://www.countryjoe.com/nightingale/school.htm The School for Nurses]</ref> Nightingale's contemporary, [[Mary Seacole]], was a Jamaican \"doctress\" who also nursed soldiers who were wounded during the Crimean War, and in the tradition of Jamaican doctresses, Seacole practised the hygiene that was later adopted by Nightingale in her writings after the Crimean War.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://helenrappaport.com/footnotes/mary-seacole-creole-doctress-nurse/|title=Mary Seacole, Creole Doctress, Nurse and Healer|date=2018-10-21|website=Helen Rappaport|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=florence nightingale|url=http://archive.org/details/NotesOnNursingByFlorenceNightingale|title=notes on nursing by florence nightingale}}</ref><ref>Elizabeth Anionwu, Mary Seacole: Nursing in Many Lands https://www.uwl.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Academic-schools/College-of-Nursing-Midwifery-and-Healthcare/Web/PDF/Elizabeth%20Anionwu%20Papers/Mary%20Seacole%20-%20nursing%20care%20in%20many%20lands%20May2012.pdf</ref>\n\nNightingale's revelation of the abysmal nursing care afforded soldiers in the Crimean War energized reformers. Queen Victoria in 1860 ordered a hospital to be built to train Army nurses and surgeons, the [[Netley Hospital|Royal Victoria Hospital]]. The hospital opened in 1863 in [[Netley]] and admitted and cared for military patients. Beginning in 1866, nurses were formally appointed to Military General Hospitals. The [[Army Nursing Service]] (ANS) oversaw the work of the nurses starting in 1881. These military nurses were sent overseas beginning with the [[First Boer War]] (often called Zulu War) from 1879 to 1881.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/army-medical-services/qaranc/9910.aspx|publisher=British Army Website|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028190846/http://www.army.mod.uk/army-medical-services/qaranc/9910.aspx|archivedate=28 October 2011}}</ref> They were also dispatched to serve during the Egyptian Campaign in 1882 and the Sudan War of 1883 to 1884. During the Sudan War members of the Army Nursing Service nursed in hospital ships on the Nile as well as the Citadel in Cairo. Almost 2000 nurses served during the second [[Boer War]], the Anglo-Boer War of 1899 to 1902, alongside nurses who were part of the colonial armies of Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

These nuns were trying to open up a mission that cared for the spiritual and physical needs of patients. The establishment of this mission created the first nursing apprenticeship training in North America.<ref name=\"test\">[http://www.cna-nurses.ca/CNA/nursing/certification/specialties/default_e.aspx Link text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229233442/http://www.cna-nurses.ca/cna/nursing/certification/specialties/default_e.aspx |date=2011-12-29 }}, additional text.</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century there were some Catholic orders of nursing that were trying to spread their message across Canada. These women had only an occasional consultations with a physician. Towards the end of the nineteenth century hospital care and medical services had been improved and expanded. Much of this was due to the Nightingale model, which prevailed in English Canada. In 1874 the first formal nursing training program was started at the General and Marine Hospital in St. Catharines in [[Ontario]].<ref name=\"test\" /> Many programs popped up in hospitals across Canada after this one was established. Graduates and teachers from these programs began to fight for licensing legislation, nursing journals, university training for nurses, and for professional organizations for nurses.\n\nThe first instance of Canadian nurses and the military was in 1885 with the [[Northwest Rebellion]]. Some nurses came out to aid the wounded. In 1901 Canadian nurses were officially part of the [[Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps]].<ref name=\"test\" /> [[Georgina Fane Pope]] and [[Margaret C. MacDonald]] were the first nurses officially recognized as military nurses.<ref name=\"test\" />\n\nCanadian [[missionary nurses]] were also of great importance in Henan, China as a part of the North China Mission starting in 1888.\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries women made inroads into various professions including teaching, journalism, social work, and public health. These advances included the establishment of a Women's Medical College in Toronto (and in Kingston, Ontario) in 1883, attributed in part to the persistence of [[Emily Stowe]], the first female doctor to practice in Canada. Stowe's daughter, [[Augusta Stowe-Gullen]], became the first woman to graduate from a Canadian medical school.<ref>Alison Prentice, ''Canadian Women: A History'' (1988).</ref>\n\nApart from a token few, women were outsiders to the male-dominated medical profession. As physicians became better organized, they successfully had laws passed to control the practice of medicine and pharmacy and banning marginal and traditional practitioners. Midwifery\u2014practiced along traditional lines by women\u2014was restricted and practically died out by 1900.<ref>C. Lesley Biggs, \"The Case of the Missing Midwives: A History of Midwifery in Ontario from 1795\u20131900,\" ''Ontario History,'' (1983) 75#1 pp. 21\u201335</ref> Even so, the great majority of childbirths took place at home until the 1920s, when hospitals became preferred, especially by women who were better educated, more modern, and more trusting in modern medicine.<ref>Jo Oppenheimer, \"Childbirth in Ontario: The Transition from Home to Hospital in the Early Twentieth Century,\" ''Ontario History,'' (1983) 75#1 pp. 36\u201360</ref>\n\n====Prairie provinces====\nIn the Prairie provinces, the first homesteaders relied on themselves for medical services. Poverty and geographic isolation empowered women to learn and practice medical care with the herbs, roots, and berries that worked for their mothers. They prayed for divine intervention but also practiced supernatural magic that provided as much psychological as physical relief. The reliance on homeopathic remedies continued as trained nurses and doctors and how-to manuals slowly reached the homesteaders in the early 20th century.<ref>Anne Woywitka, \"Pioneers In Sickness and in Health.\" ''Alberta History'' 2001 49(1): 16\u201320.</ref>\n\nAfter 1900 medicine and especially nursing modernized and became well organized.\n\nThe Lethbridge Nursing Mission in Alberta was a representative Canadian voluntary mission. It was founded, independent of the Victorian Order of Nurses, in 1909 by Jessie Turnbull Robinson. A former nurse, Robinson was elected as president of the Lethbridge Relief Society and began district nursing services aimed at poor women and children. The mission was governed by a volunteer board of women directors and began by raising money for its first year of service through charitable donations and payments from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The mission also blended social work with nursing, becoming the dispenser of unemployment relief.<ref>Sharon Richardson, \"Women's Enterprise: Establishing The Lethbridge Nursing Mission, 1909-1919.\" ''Nursing History Review'' 1997 5: 105\u2013130. 1062\u20138061</ref>\n\nRichardson (1998) examines the social, political, economic, class, and professional factors that contributed to ideological and practical differences between leaders of the Alberta Association of Graduate Nurses (AAGN), established in 1916, and the United Farm Women of Alberta (UFWA), founded in 1915, regarding the promotion and acceptance of midwifery as a recognized subspecialty of registered nurses. Accusing the AAGN of ignoring the medical needs of rural Alberta women, the leaders of the UFWA worked to improve economic and living conditions of women farmers. Irene Parlby, the UFWA's first president, lobbied for the establishment of a provincial Department of Public Health, government-provided hospitals and doctors, and passage of a law to permit nurses to qualify as registered midwives. The AAGN leadership opposed midwife certification, arguing that nursing curricula left no room for midwife study, and thus nurses were not qualified to participate in home births. In 1919 the AAGN compromised with the UFWA, and they worked together for the passage of the Public Health Nurses Act that allowed nurses to serve as midwives in regions without doctors. Thus, Alberta's District Nursing Service, created in 1919 to coordinate the province's women's health resources, resulted chiefly from the organized, persistent political activism of UFWA members and only minimally from the actions of professional nursing groups clearly uninterested in rural Canadians' medical needs.<ref>Sharon Richardson, \"Political Women, Professional Nurses, and the Creation of Alberta's District Nursing Service, 1919-1925.\" ''Nursing History Review'' 1998 6: 25\u201350. 1062\u20138061</ref>\n\nThe Alberta District Nursing Service administered health care in the predominantly rural and impoverished areas of Alberta in the first half of the 20th century. Founded in 1919 to meet maternal and emergency medical needs by the United Farm Women (UFWA), the Nursing Service treated prairie settlers living in primitive areas lacking doctors and hospitals. Nurses provided prenatal care, worked as midwives, performed minor surgery, conducted medical inspections of schoolchildren, and sponsored immunization programs. The post-Second World War discovery of large oil and gas reserves resulted in economic prosperity and the expansion of local medical services. The passage of provincial health and universal hospital insurance in 1957 precipitated the eventual phasing out of the obsolete District Nursing Service in 1976.<ref>Sharon Richardson, \"Frontier Health Care: Alberta's District and Municipal Nursing Services, 1919 to 1976.\" ''Alberta History'' 1998 46(1): 2\u20139.</ref>\n\n====Recent trends====\nAfter World War II, the health care system expanded and was nationalized with medicare. Currently there are 260,000 nurses in Canada but they face the same difficulties as most countries, as technology advances and the aging population requires more nursing care.\n\n===Mexico===\n[[File:Elena Arizmendi Neutral White Cross.PNG|thumb|[[Elena Arizmendi Mejia]] and volunteers of the Mexican [[Neutral White Cross]], 1911]]\nDuring most of Mexico's wars in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, [[camp followers]] known as [[soldaderas]] nursed soldiers wounded in warfare.<ref>Friedrich Katz, ''The Life and Times of Pancho Villa''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1998, 291.</ref> During the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910-1920) care of soldiers in northern Mexico was also undertaken by the [[Neutral White Cross]], founded by [[Elena Arizmendi Mejia]] after the Mexican Red Cross refused to treat revolutionary soldiers. The Neutral White Cross treated soldiers regardless of their faction.\n\n===France===\nProfessionalization of nursing in France came in the late 19th and early 20th century. In 1870 France's 1,500 hospitals were operated by 11,000 Catholic sisters; by 1911 there were 15,000 nuns representing over 200 religious orders. Government policy after 1900 was to secularize public institutions, and diminish the role the Catholic Churches. The lay staff was enlarged from 14,000 in 1890 to 95,000 in 1911. This political goal came in conflict with the need to maintain better quality of medical care in antiquated facilities.<ref>Katrin. Schultheiss, \"Gender and the Limits of Anti-Clericalism: The Secularization of Hospital Nursing in France, 1880\u20131914,\" ''French History'' (1998) 12#3 pp 229-245</ref> Many doctors, while personally anti-clerical, realized their dependence on the Catholic sisters. Most lay nurses came from peasant or working-class families and were poorly trained. Faced with the long hours and low pay, many soon married and left the field, while the Catholic sisters had renounced marriage and saw nursing as their God-given vocation. New government-operated nursing schools turned out nonreligous nurses who were slated for supervisory roles. During the World War, an outpouring of patriotic volunteers brought large numbers of untrained middle-class women into the military hospitals. They left when the war ended but the long-term effect was to heighten the prestige of nursing. In 1922 the government issued a national diploma for nursing.<ref>Katrin Schultheiss, ''Bodies and Souls: politics and the professionalization of nursing in France, 1880\u20131922'' (2001), pp. 3\u201311, 99, 116</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{main|History of nursing in the United States}}\n[[File:Lillian Wald - William Valentine Schevill.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Lillian Wald]], pioneer of [[public health nursing]], by William Valentine Schevill, [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\n[[File:Mother Marianne Cope in her youth.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint [[Marianne Cope]] was among many Catholic nuns to influence the development of modern hospitals and nursing.]]\n[[File:Armynursecorps.jpg|thumb|upright|World War II Recruiting poster for the [[United States Army Nurse Corps]] (founded 1901)]]\n\nNursing professionalized rapidly in the late 19th century as larger hospitals set\nup nursing schools that attracted ambitious women from middle- and working-class backgrounds. [[Agnes Elizabeth Jones]] and [[Linda Richards]] established quality [[nursing schools]] in the U.S. and Japan; [[Linda Richards]] was officially America's first professionally trained nurse, having been trained at [[Nightingale School of Nursing|Florence Nightingale's training school]], and subsequently graduating in 1873 from the ''[[New England Hospital for Women and Children]]'' in Boston\n\nIn the early 1900s, the autonomous, nursing-controlled, Nightingale-era schools came to an end. Despite the establishment of university-affiliated nursing schools, such as Columbia and Yale, hospital training programs were dominant. Formal \"book learning\" was discouraged in favor of clinical experience through an apprenticeship. In order to meet a growing demand, hospitals used student nurses as cheap labor at the expense of quality formal education.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=Anne M.|title=Advanced practice nursing: essential knowledge for the profession|date=2009|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, Mass.|isbn=978-0763748999|pages=[https://archive.org/details/advancedpractice0000unse_x6u4/page/10 10\u201311]|url=https://archive.org/details/advancedpractice0000unse_x6u4/page/10}}</ref>\n\n===Jamaica===\n[[Mary Seacole]] came from a long line of Jamaican nurses, or \"doctresses\", who worked at healing British soldiers and sailors at the Jamaican military base of [[Port Royal]]. These doctresses of the eighteenth century used good hygiene and herbal remedies to nurse their clients back to health. In the eighteenth century, these doctresses included Seacole's mother, who was a mixed-race woman who was most likely a child of a slave, and who acquired medical knowledge of herbal remedies from West African ancestors.<ref>Robinson, Jane (2004), ''Mary Seacole: The Charismatic Black Nurse who became a heroine of the Crimea''.</ref> Other 18th century doctresses included Sarah Adams and Grace Donne, the mistress and healer to Jamaica's wealthiest planter, [[Simon Taylor (sugar planter)|Simon Taylor]].

All the major denominations built hospitals; in 1915, the Catholic Church ran 541, staffed primarily by unpaid nuns.<ref>Bernadette McCauley, ''Who shall take care of our sick?: Roman Catholic sisters and the development of Catholic hospitals in New York City'' (Johns Hopkins UP, 2005)\n</ref> The others sometimes had a small cadre of [[deaconesses]] as staff. Most larger hospitals operated a school of nursing, which provided training to young women, who in turn did much of the staffing on an unpaid basis. The number of active graduate nurses rose rapidly from 51,000 in 1910 to 375,000 in 1940 and 700,000 in 1970.<ref>''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1976) p 76</ref>\n\nThe Protestant churches reentered the health field, especially by setting up orders of women, called deaconesses who dedicated themselves to nursing services.\n\nThe modern deaconess movement began in Germany in 1836 when [[Theodor Fliedner]] and his wife opened the first deaconess motherhouse in [[Kaiserswerth]] on the Rhine. It became a model and within a half century were over 5,000 deaconesses in Europe. The Chursh of England named its first deaconess in 1862. The North London Deaconess Institution trained deaconesses for other dioceses and some served overseas.<ref>{{cite book|author=Henrietta Blackmore|title=The beginning of women's ministry: the revival of the deaconess in the nineteenth-century Church of England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LQxO03zXygC&pg=PA131|publisher=Boydell Press|page=131}}</ref>\n\n[[William Passavant]] in 1849 brought the first four deaconesses to Pittsburgh, in the United States, after visiting Kaiserswerth.

Methodists in America took note, and began opening their own charitable institutions such as orphanages and old people's homes after 1860. In the 1880s, Methodists began opening hospitals in the United States, which served people of all religious backgrounds beliefs.

At the beginning of the War, nurses were not dispatched to the casualty clearing stations near the front lines, where they would be exposed to shell fire. They were initially assigned to hospitals a safe distance away from the front lines. As the war continued, however, nurses were assigned to casualty clearing stations.

Nursing recruitment was sporadic, with some reserve nurses sent with the advance parties to set up the transport ship HMAS ''Gascoyne'' while others simply fronted to Barracks and were accepted, while still others were expected to pay for their passage in steerage. Australian nurses from this period became known as \"grey ghosts\" because of their drab uniforms with starched collar and cuffs.\n\nDuring the course of the war, Australian nurses were granted their own administration rather than working under medical officers. Australian Nurses hold the record for the maximum number of triage cases processed by a casualty station in a twenty-four-hour period during the [[battle of Passchendale]]. Their work routinely included administering ether during haemostatic surgery and managing and training medical assistants (orderlies).<ref>Guns and Brooches: Australian Army Nursing Boer - Gulf War by Jan Bassett</ref>\n\nSome 560 Australian army nurses served in India during the war, where they had to overcome a debilitating climate, outbreaks of disease, insufficient numbers, overwork and hostile British Army officers.<ref>Ruth Rae, \"Reading between Unwritten Lines: Australian Army Nurses in India, 1916\u201319\", '' Journal of the Australian War Memorial'' (2001), #36 pp. 1+</ref>\n\n===Interwar===\nSurveys in the U.S. showed that nurses often got married a few years after graduation and quit work; other waited 5 to 10 years for marriage; careerists some never married. By the 1920s increasing numbers of married nurses continued to work. The high turnover meant that advanvcement could be rapid; the average age of a nursing supervisor in a hospital was only 26 years. Wages for private duty nurses were high in the 1920s\u2014$1,300 a year when working full-time in patients' homes or at their private rooms in hospitals. This was more than double what a woman could earn as a teacher or in office work. Rates fell sharply when the Great Depression came in 1929, and continuous work was much harder to find.<ref>Susan Reverby, ''Ordered to Care'', pp. 98, 103, 105</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n\n====Canada====\nOver 4000 women served as nurses in uniform in the Canadian Armed Forces during the Second World War. They were called \"Nursing Sisters\" and had already been professionally trained in civilian life. However, in military service they achieved an elite status well above what they had experienced as civilians. The Nursing Sisters had much more responsibility and autonomy, and had more opportunity to use their expertise, then civilian nurses. They were often close to the front lines, and the military doctors \u2013 all men \u2013 delegated significant responsibility to the nurses because of the high level of casualties, the shortages of physicians, and extreme working conditions.<ref>Cynthia Toman, \"Front Lines and Frontiers: War as Legitimate Work for Nurses, 1939\u20131945,\" ''Social History/Histoire Sociale'' (2007) 40#79 pp. 45\u201374.</ref><ref>Cynthia Toman, ''An Officer and a Lady: Canadian Military Nursing and the Second World War'' (2007)</ref>\n\n====Australia====\n{{further|Australian Army Nursing Service}}\n[[File:Centaur (ARTV09088).png|thumb|right|Centaur poster]]\nIn 1942, sixty five front line nurses from the General Hospital Division in British Singapore were ordered aboard the Vyner Brook and Empire Star for evacuation, rather than caring for wounded. The ships were strafed with machine gun fire by Japanese planes. Sisters Vera Torney and Margaret Anderson were awarded medals when they could find nothing else on the crowded deck and covered their patients with their own bodies. A version of this action was honoured in the film [[Paradise Road (1997 film)|''Paradise Road'']]. The Vyner Brook was bombed and sank quickly in shallow water of the Sumatra Strait and all but twenty-one were lost at sea, presumed drowned. The remaining nurses swam ashore at Mentok, [[Sumatra]]. The twenty-one nurses and some British and Australian troops were marched into the sea and killed with machine gun fire in the [[Banka Island massacre]]. Sister [[Vivian Bullwinkel]] was the only survivor. She became Australia's premier nursing war hero when she nursed wounded British soldiers in the jungle for three weeks, despite her own flesh wound. She survived on the charity provided by Indonesian locals, but eventually hunger and the privations of hiding in mangrove swamp forced her to surrender. She remained imprisoned for the remainder of the war.\n\nAt around the same time, another group of twelve nurses stationed at the Rabaul mission in New Guinea were captured along with missionaries by invading Japanese troops and interred at their camp for two years. They cared for a number of British, Australian and American wounded. Toward the end of the war, they were transferred to a concentration camp in Kyoto and imprisoned under freezing conditions and forced into hard labour.\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 105020 Nurses of the Second A.I.F. leaving the Brisbane City Hall, 1940.jpg|thumb|right|Australian sisters]]\n\n====United States====\n\nAs Campbell (1984) shows, the nursing profession was transformed by World War Two. Army and Navy nursing was highly attractive and a larger proportion of nurses volunteered for service higher than any other occupation in American society.<ref>Deann Campbell, ''Women at War with America: Private Lives in a Patriotic Era'' (1984) ch 2</ref><ref>Philip A. Kalisch and Beatrice J. Kalisch, ''American Nursing: A History'' (4th ed. 2003)</ref>\n\nThe public image of the nurses was highly favorable during the war, as the simplified by such Hollywood films as \"Cry 'Havoc'\" which made the selfless nurses heroes under enemy fire. Some nurses were captured by the Japanese,<ref>Elizabeth Norman, '' We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese'' (1999)</ref> but in practice they were kept out of harm's way, with the great majority stationed on the home front. However, 77 were stationed in the jungles of the Pacific, where their uniform consisted of \"khaki slacks, mud, shirts, mud, field shoes, mud, and fatigues.\"<ref>Mary T.

Roosevelt hailed the service of nurses in the war effort in his final \"Fireside Chat\" of January 6, 1945. Expecting heavy casualties in the invasion of Japan, he called for a compulsory draft of nurses. The casualties never happened and there was never a draft of American nurses.<ref>see [https://archive.org/details/1945RadioNews 1945 Radio News : WA4CZD : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====Britain====\nDuring [[World War II]], nurses belonged to [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps|Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS), as they had during World War I, and as they remain today. (Nurses belonging to the QAIMNS are informally called \"QA\"s.) Members of the Army Nursing Service served in every overseas British military campaign during World War II, as well as at military hospitals in Britain. At the beginning of World War II, nurses held officer status with equivalent rank, but were not commissioned officers. In 1941, emergency commissions and a rank structure were created, conforming with the structure used in the rest of the British Army. Nurses were given rank badges and were now able to be promoted to ranks from Lieutenant through to Brigadier.<ref>{{cite web|title=QA World War Two Nursing|url=http://www.qaranc.co.uk/qa_world_war_two_nursing.php|publisher=qaranc.co.uk|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref> Nurses were exposed to all dangers during the War, and some were captured and became prisoners of war.\n\n====Germany====\nGermany had a very large and well organized nursing service, with three main organizations, one for Catholics, one for Protestants, and the DRK (Red Cross). In 1934 the Nazis set up their own nursing unit, the Brown Nurses, absorbing one of the smaller groups, bringing it up to 40,000 members. It set up kindergartens, hoping to seize control of the minds of the younger Germans, in competition with the other nursing organizations. Civilian psychiatric nurses who were Nazi party members participated in the killings of invalids, although the process was shrouded in euphemisms and denials.<ref>Bronny Rebekah McFarland-Icky, ''Nurses in Nazi Germany'' (Princeton University Press, 1999)</ref>\n\nMilitary nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Front line medical services were provided by male medics and doctors. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals that perforce were close to the front lines and at risk of bombing attacks. Two dozen were awarded the highly prestigious Iron Cross for heroism under fire. They are among the 470,000 German women who served with the military.<ref>Gordon Williamson, ''World War II German Women's Auxiliary Services'' (2003) pp. 34\u201336</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=24em}}\n* [[History of Nursing in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of nursing in the United States]]\n* [[History of Philippine nurses in the United States]]\n* [[Nursing in Australia]]\n* [[Nursing in Germany]]\n* [[Nursing in Canada#History]]\n* [[Nursing in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Nursing in India]]\n* [[Nursing in Japan]]\n* [[Nursing in Islam]]\n* [[Nursing in Kenya]]\n* [[Nursing in Pakistan]]\n* [[Nursing in the Philippines]]\n* [[Nursing in Taiwan]]\n* [[Nursing in Bangladesh]]\n* [[Nursing in the United States]]\n* [[List of nurses]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|24em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Andrist, Linda C. et al. eds.

After she had led a group of women to treat injured fighters on the battlefield, Muhammad gave her permission to set up a tent near the Medina mosque to provide treatment and care for the ill and the needy.<ref>[https://blog.nurserecruiter.com/many-centuries-before-florence-nightingale-this-muslim-woman-introduced-nursing-to-the-arabic-world/ \"Many centuries before Florence Nightingale, this Muslim woman introduced nursing to the Arabic world\"]</ref>\n\n==Medieval Europe==\nMedieval hospitals in Europe followed a similar pattern to the [[Byzantine medicine|Byzantine]]. They were religious communities, with care provided by [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s. (An old French term for hospital is ''h\u00f4tel-Dieu'', \"hostel of God.\") Some were attached to monasteries; others were independent and had their own endowments, usually of property, which provided income for their support. Some hospitals were multi-functional while others were founded for specific purposes such as leper hospitals, or as refuges for the poor, or for [[pilgrim]]s: not all cared for the sick. The first Spanish hospital, founded by the Catholic [[Visigoth]] bishop [[Masona]] in 580AD at [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]], was a ''[[xenodochium]]'' designed as an inn for travellers (mostly pilgrims to the shrine of [[Eulalia of M\u00e9rida]]) as well as a hospital for citizens and local farmers. The hospital's endowment consisted of farms to feed its patients and guests. From the account given by Paul the Deacon we learn that this hospital was supplied with physicians and nurses, whose mission included the care the sick wherever they were found, \"slave or free, Christian or Jew.\" <ref>See Florez, \"Espana Sagrada\", XIII, 539; Heusinger, \"Ein Beitrag\", etc. in \"Janus\", 1846, I.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 700s and early 800s, Emperor Charlemagne decreed that those hospitals which had been well conducted before his time and had fallen into decay should be restored in accordance with the needs of the time.<ref name=\"duplex803_iii\">Capitulary Duplex, 803, chapter iii</ref> He further ordered that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery.<ref name=\"duplex803_iii\"/>\n\nDuring the tenth century the monasteries became a dominant factor in hospital work. The famous Benedictine Abbey of Cluny, founded in 910, set the example which was widely imitated throughout France and Germany. Besides its infirmary for the religious, each monastery had a hospital in which externs were cared for. These were in charge of the ''eleemosynarius'', whose duties, carefully prescribed by the rule, included every sort of service that the visitor or patient could require.\n\nAs the eleemosynarius was obliged to seek out the sick and needy in the neighborhood, each monastery became a center for the relief of suffering. Among the monasteries notable in this respect were those of the Benedictines at Corbie in Picardy, Hirschau, Braunweiler, Deutz, Ilsenburg, Liesborn, Pram, and Fulda; those of the Cistercians at Arnsberg, Baumgarten, Eberbach, Himmenrode, Herrnalb, Volkenrode, and Walkenried.\n\nNo less efficient was the work done by the diocesan clergy in accordance with the disciplinary enactments of the councils of Aachen (817, 836), which prescribed that a hospital should be maintained in connection with each collegiate church. The canons were obliged to contribute towards the support of the hospital, and one of their number had charge of the inmates. As these hospitals were located in cities, more numerous demands were made upon them than upon those attached to the monasteries. In this movement the bishop naturally took the lead, hence the hospitals founded by Heribert (d. 1021) in Cologne, Godard (d. 1038) in Hildesheim, Conrad (d. 975) in Constance, and Ulrich (d. 973) in Augsburg. But similar provision was made by the other churches; thus at Trier the hospitals of St. Maximin, St. Matthew, St. Simeon, and St. James took their names from the churches to which they were attached. During the period 1207\u20131577 no less than 155 hospitals were founded in Germany.<ref>Virchow in \"Gesch. Abhandl.\", II</ref>\n\nThe [[Ospedale Maggiore]], traditionally named Ca' Granda (i.e. Big House), in [[Milan]], northern Italy, was constructed to house one of the first community hospitals, the largest such undertaking of the fifteenth century. Commissioned by Francesco Sforza in 1456 and designed by Antonio Filarete it is among the first examples of Renaissance architecture in Lombardy.\n\nThe Normans brought their hospital system along when they conquered England in 1066. By merging with traditional land-tenure and customs, the new charitable houses became popular and were distinct from both English monasteries and French hospitals. They dispensed alms and some medicine, and were generously endowed by the nobility and gentry who counted on them for spiritual rewards after death.<ref>Sethina Watson, \"The Origins of the English Hospital,\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Sixth Series'' (2006) 16:75-94 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25593861 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nAccording to Geoffrey Blainey, the Catholic Church in Europe provided many of the services of a welfare state: \"It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal\". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates.<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Short History of Christianity'' (Penguin Viking; 2011); pp. 214\u201315.</ref>\n\n===Roles for women===\nCatholic women played large roles in health and healing in medieval and early modern Europe.<ref>Mary E.

Arab ideas were later influential in Europe. The famous [[Knights Hospitaller]] arose as a group of individuals associated with an Amalfitan hospital in Jerusalem, which was built to provide care for poor, sick or injured Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. Following the capture of the city by Crusaders, the order became a military as well as infirmarian order.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07477a.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Knights of Malta].

The same theology holds strong into the 21st century. In Catholic areas, the tradition of nursing sisters continued uninterrupted. Several orders of nuns provided nursing services in hospitals.<ref>Colin Jones, ''The Charitable Imperative.

For example, in rural [[Brittany]] in France, the [[Daughters of the Holy Spirit]], created in 1706, played a central role. New opportunity for nuns as charitable practitioners were created by devout nobles on their own estates. The nuns provided comprehensive care for the sick poor on their patrons' estates, acting not only as nurses, but took on expanded roles as physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries. The French Catholics in [[New France]] (Canada) and New Orleans continued these traditions. During the French Revolution, most of the orders of nurses were shut down and there was no organized nursing care to replace them.<ref name=\"McHugh\"/> However the demand for their nursing services remained strong, and after 1800 the sisters reappeared and resumed their work in hospitals and on rural estates. They were tolerated by officials because they had widespread support and were the link between elite physicians and distrustful peasants who needed help.<ref>Jacques L\u00e9onard, \"Femmes, Religion et M\u00e9decine: Les Religieuses qui Soignent, en France au XIXe Si\u00e8cle,\" ''Annales: Economies, Societes, Civilisations'' (1977) 32#5 pp. 887\u2013907</ref>\n\n===Protestantism closes the hospitals===\nThe Protestant reformers, led by [[Martin Luther]], rejected the notion that rich men could gain God's grace through good works\u2014and thereby escape purgatory\u2014by providing cash endowments to charitable institutions.

The role had virtually died out centuries before, but was revived in Germany in 1836 when [[Theodor Fliedner]] and his wife Friederike M\u00fcnster opened the first deaconess motherhouse in [[Kaiserswerth]] on the Rhine. The diaconate was soon brought to England and Scandinavia, Kaiserswerth model. The women obligated themselves for 5 years of service, receiving room, board, uniforms, pocket money, and lifelong care. The uniform was the usual dress of the married woman. There were variations, such as an emphasis on preparing women for marriage through training in nursing, child care, social work and housework. In the Anglican Church, the diaconate was an auxiliary to the pastorate, and there were no mother houses. By 1890 there were over 5,000 deaconesses in Protestant Europe, chiefly Germany, Scandinavia, and England. In World War II, diaconates in war zones sustained heavy damage. As eastern Europe fell to communism, most diaconates were shut down, and 7,000 deaconesses became refugees in West Germany. By 1957, in Germany there were 46,000 deaconesses and 10,000 associates. Other countries reported a total of 14,000 deaconesses, most of them Lutherans. In the United States and Canada 1,550 women were counted, half of them in the Methodist Church.<ref>Sister Mildred Winter, \"Deaconess,\" in Julius Bodensieck, ed.

The hospital opened in 1863 in [[Netley]] and admitted and cared for military patients. Beginning in 1866, nurses were formally appointed to Military General Hospitals. The [[Army Nursing Service]] (ANS) oversaw the work of the nurses starting in 1881.

These women had only an occasional consultations with a physician. Towards the end of the nineteenth century hospital care and medical services had been improved and expanded. Much of this was due to the Nightingale model, which prevailed in English Canada. In 1874 the first formal nursing training program was started at the General and Marine Hospital in St. Catharines in [[Ontario]].<ref name=\"test\" /> Many programs popped up in hospitals across Canada after this one was established. Graduates and teachers from these programs began to fight for licensing legislation, nursing journals, university training for nurses, and for professional organizations for nurses.\n\nThe first instance of Canadian nurses and the military was in 1885 with the [[Northwest Rebellion]]. Some nurses came out to aid the wounded. In 1901 Canadian nurses were officially part of the [[Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps]].<ref name=\"test\" /> [[Georgina Fane Pope]] and [[Margaret C. MacDonald]] were the first nurses officially recognized as military nurses.<ref name=\"test\" />\n\nCanadian [[missionary nurses]] were also of great importance in Henan, China as a part of the North China Mission starting in 1888.\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries women made inroads into various professions including teaching, journalism, social work, and public health. These advances included the establishment of a Women's Medical College in Toronto (and in Kingston, Ontario) in 1883, attributed in part to the persistence of [[Emily Stowe]], the first female doctor to practice in Canada. Stowe's daughter, [[Augusta Stowe-Gullen]], became the first woman to graduate from a Canadian medical school.<ref>Alison Prentice, ''Canadian Women: A History'' (1988).</ref>\n\nApart from a token few, women were outsiders to the male-dominated medical profession. As physicians became better organized, they successfully had laws passed to control the practice of medicine and pharmacy and banning marginal and traditional practitioners. Midwifery\u2014practiced along traditional lines by women\u2014was restricted and practically died out by 1900.<ref>C.

Poverty and geographic isolation empowered women to learn and practice medical care with the herbs, roots, and berries that worked for their mothers. They prayed for divine intervention but also practiced supernatural magic that provided as much psychological as physical relief. The reliance on homeopathic remedies continued as trained nurses and doctors and how-to manuals slowly reached the homesteaders in the early 20th century.<ref>Anne Woywitka, \"Pioneers In Sickness and in Health.\" ''Alberta History'' 2001 49(1): 16\u201320.</ref>\n\nAfter 1900 medicine and especially nursing modernized and became well organized.\n\nThe Lethbridge Nursing Mission in Alberta was a representative Canadian voluntary mission. It was founded, independent of the Victorian Order of Nurses, in 1909 by Jessie Turnbull Robinson. A former nurse, Robinson was elected as president of the Lethbridge Relief Society and began district nursing services aimed at poor women and children. The mission was governed by a volunteer board of women directors and began by raising money for its first year of service through charitable donations and payments from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The mission also blended social work with nursing, becoming the dispenser of unemployment relief.<ref>Sharon Richardson, \"Women's Enterprise: Establishing The Lethbridge Nursing Mission, 1909-1919.\" ''Nursing History Review'' 1997 5: 105\u2013130. 1062\u20138061</ref>\n\nRichardson (1998) examines the social, political, economic, class, and professional factors that contributed to ideological and practical differences between leaders of the Alberta Association of Graduate Nurses (AAGN), established in 1916, and the United Farm Women of Alberta (UFWA), founded in 1915, regarding the promotion and acceptance of midwifery as a recognized subspecialty of registered nurses. Accusing the AAGN of ignoring the medical needs of rural Alberta women, the leaders of the UFWA worked to improve economic and living conditions of women farmers. Irene Parlby, the UFWA's first president, lobbied for the establishment of a provincial Department of Public Health, government-provided hospitals and doctors, and passage of a law to permit nurses to qualify as registered midwives. The AAGN leadership opposed midwife certification, arguing that nursing curricula left no room for midwife study, and thus nurses were not qualified to participate in home births. In 1919 the AAGN compromised with the UFWA, and they worked together for the passage of the Public Health Nurses Act that allowed nurses to serve as midwives in regions without doctors. Thus, Alberta's District Nursing Service, created in 1919 to coordinate the province's women's health resources, resulted chiefly from the organized, persistent political activism of UFWA members and only minimally from the actions of professional nursing groups clearly uninterested in rural Canadians' medical needs.<ref>Sharon Richardson, \"Political Women, Professional Nurses, and the Creation of Alberta's District Nursing Service, 1919-1925.\" ''Nursing History Review'' 1998 6: 25\u201350. 1062\u20138061</ref>\n\nThe Alberta District Nursing Service administered health care in the predominantly rural and impoverished areas of Alberta in the first half of the 20th century. Founded in 1919 to meet maternal and emergency medical needs by the United Farm Women (UFWA), the Nursing Service treated prairie settlers living in primitive areas lacking doctors and hospitals. Nurses provided prenatal care, worked as midwives, performed minor surgery, conducted medical inspections of schoolchildren, and sponsored immunization programs. The post-Second World War discovery of large oil and gas reserves resulted in economic prosperity and the expansion of local medical services. The passage of provincial health and universal hospital insurance in 1957 precipitated the eventual phasing out of the obsolete District Nursing Service in 1976.<ref>Sharon Richardson, \"Frontier Health Care: Alberta's District and Municipal Nursing Services, 1919 to 1976.\" ''Alberta History'' 1998 46(1): 2\u20139.</ref>\n\n====Recent trends====\nAfter World War II, the health care system expanded and was nationalized with medicare. Currently there are 260,000 nurses in Canada but they face the same difficulties as most countries, as technology advances and the aging population requires more nursing care.\n\n===Mexico===\n[[File:Elena Arizmendi Neutral White Cross.PNG|thumb|[[Elena Arizmendi Mejia]] and volunteers of the Mexican [[Neutral White Cross]], 1911]]\nDuring most of Mexico's wars in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, [[camp followers]] known as [[soldaderas]] nursed soldiers wounded in warfare.<ref>Friedrich Katz, ''The Life and Times of Pancho Villa''.

The Neutral White Cross treated soldiers regardless of their faction.\n\n===France===\nProfessionalization of nursing in France came in the late 19th and early 20th century. In 1870 France's 1,500 hospitals were operated by 11,000 Catholic sisters; by 1911 there were 15,000 nuns representing over 200 religious orders. Government policy after 1900 was to secularize public institutions, and diminish the role the Catholic Churches. The lay staff was enlarged from 14,000 in 1890 to 95,000 in 1911.

Most lay nurses came from peasant or working-class families and were poorly trained. Faced with the long hours and low pay, many soon married and left the field, while the Catholic sisters had renounced marriage and saw nursing as their God-given vocation. New government-operated nursing schools turned out nonreligous nurses who were slated for supervisory roles. During the World War, an outpouring of patriotic volunteers brought large numbers of untrained middle-class women into the military hospitals. They left when the war ended but the long-term effect was to heighten the prestige of nursing. In 1922 the government issued a national diploma for nursing.<ref>Katrin Schultheiss, ''Bodies and Souls: politics and the professionalization of nursing in France, 1880\u20131922'' (2001), pp. 3\u201311, 99, 116</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{main|History of nursing in the United States}}\n[[File:Lillian Wald - William Valentine Schevill.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Lillian Wald]], pioneer of [[public health nursing]], by William Valentine Schevill, [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\n[[File:Mother Marianne Cope in her youth.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint [[Marianne Cope]] was among many Catholic nuns to influence the development of modern hospitals and nursing.]]\n[[File:Armynursecorps.jpg|thumb|upright|World War II Recruiting poster for the [[United States Army Nurse Corps]] (founded 1901)]]\n\nNursing professionalized rapidly in the late 19th century as larger hospitals set\nup nursing schools that attracted ambitious women from middle- and working-class backgrounds. [[Agnes Elizabeth Jones]] and [[Linda Richards]] established quality [[nursing schools]] in the U.S. and Japan; [[Linda Richards]] was officially America's first professionally trained nurse, having been trained at [[Nightingale School of Nursing|Florence Nightingale's training school]], and subsequently graduating in 1873 from the ''[[New England Hospital for Women and Children]]'' in Boston\n\nIn the early 1900s, the autonomous, nursing-controlled, Nightingale-era schools came to an end. Despite the establishment of university-affiliated nursing schools, such as Columbia and Yale, hospital training programs were dominant. Formal \"book learning\" was discouraged in favor of clinical experience through an apprenticeship. In order to meet a growing demand, hospitals used student nurses as cheap labor at the expense of quality formal education.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=Anne M.|title=Advanced practice nursing: essential knowledge for the profession|date=2009|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, Mass.|isbn=978-0763748999|pages=[https://archive.org/details/advancedpractice0000unse_x6u4/page/10 10\u201311]|url=https://archive.org/details/advancedpractice0000unse_x6u4/page/10}}</ref>\n\n===Jamaica===\n[[Mary Seacole]] came from a long line of Jamaican nurses, or \"doctresses\", who worked at healing British soldiers and sailors at the Jamaican military base of [[Port Royal]]. These doctresses of the eighteenth century used good hygiene and herbal remedies to nurse their clients back to health. In the eighteenth century, these doctresses included Seacole's mother, who was a mixed-race woman who was most likely a child of a slave, and who acquired medical knowledge of herbal remedies from West African ancestors.<ref>Robinson, Jane (2004), ''Mary Seacole: The Charismatic Black Nurse who became a heroine of the Crimea''.</ref> Other 18th century doctresses included Sarah Adams and Grace Donne, the mistress and healer to Jamaica's wealthiest planter, [[Simon Taylor (sugar planter)|Simon Taylor]].

All the major denominations built hospitals; in 1915, the Catholic Church ran 541, staffed primarily by unpaid nuns.<ref>Bernadette McCauley, ''Who shall take care of our sick?: Roman Catholic sisters and the development of Catholic hospitals in New York City'' (Johns Hopkins UP, 2005)\n</ref> The others sometimes had a small cadre of [[deaconesses]] as staff. Most larger hospitals operated a school of nursing, which provided training to young women, who in turn did much of the staffing on an unpaid basis.

It became a model and within a half century were over 5,000 deaconesses in Europe. The Chursh of England named its first deaconess in 1862.

But even as late as the 1870s, \"women working in North American urban hospitals typically were untrained, working class, and accorded lowly status by both the medical profession they supported and society at large\".

These services dated to 1902 and 1918, and enjoyed royal sponsorship. There also were [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] (VAD) nurses who had been enrolled by the Red Cross.<ref>Brenda McBride, ''Quiet Heroines: Story of the Nurses of the Second World War'' (1985)</ref> The ranks that were created for the new nursing services were Matron-in-Chief, Principal Matron, Sister and Staff Nurses. Women joined steadily throughout the War. At the end of 1914, there were 2,223 regular and reserve members of the QAIMNS and when the war ended there were 10,404 trained nurses in the QAIMNS.<ref name=\"qaranc.co.uk\"/>\n\n[[Grace McDougall]] (1887\u20131963) was the energetic commandant of the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), which had formed in 1907 as an auxiliary to the home guard in Britain. McDougall at one point was captured by the Germans but escaped. The British army wanted nothing to do with them so they drove ambulances and ran hospitals and casualty clearing stations for the Belgian and French armies.<ref>Roy Terry, \"McDougall, Grace Alexandra (1887\u20131963)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2004); online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59610, accessed 6 March 2013]</ref><ref>Janet Lee, \"A Nurse and a Soldier: Gender, Class and National Identity in the First World War Adventures of Grace McDougall and Flora Sandes,\" ''[[Women's History Review]]'' (2006) 15#1 pp. 83\u2013103; Janet Lee, ''War girls: the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry in the First World War'' (Manchester University Press, 2012)</ref>\n\n====Canada====\nWhen Canadian nurses volunteered to serve during World War I, they were made commissioned officers by the [[Canadian Army]] before being sent overseas,<ref name=\"Nurses Canadian Military\">{{cite web|title=Nurses (Canadian Military)|url=http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/flash/gl-ga/index-eng.asp?letter=N&page=2|publisher=Canadian Military History Gateway|accessdate=28 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120050616/http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/flash/gl-ga/index-eng.asp?letter=N&page=2|archive-date=20 January 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> a move that would grant them some authority in the ranks, so that enlisted patients and orderlies would have to comply with their direction. Canada was the first country in the world to grant women this privilege. At the beginning of the War, nurses were not dispatched to the casualty clearing stations near the front lines, where they would be exposed to shell fire. They were initially assigned to hospitals a safe distance away from the front lines. As the war continued, however, nurses were assigned to casualty clearing stations. They were exposed to shelling, and caring for soldiers with \"[[shell shock]]\" and casualties suffering the effects of new weapons such as poisonous gas, as Katherine Wilson-Sammie recollects in ''Lights Out! A Canadian Nursing Sister\u2019s Tale''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson-Sammie|first=Katherine M.|title=Lights Out!

Nurses were among the casualties.\n\nCanadian women volunteering to serve overseas as nurses overwhelmed the army with applications.<ref name=\"Quinn\"/> A total of 3,141 Canadian \"nursing sisters\" served in the [[Canadian Army Medical Corps]] and 2,504 of those served overseas in England, France and the Eastern Mediterranean at Gallipoli, Alexandria and Salonika. By the end of the First World War, 46 Canadian Nursing Sisters had died<ref name=\"Nurses Canadian Military\"/> In addition to these nurses serving overseas with the military, others volunteered and paid their own way over with organizations such as the [[Canadian Red Cross]], the [[Victorian Order of Nurses]], and [[St. John Ambulance]]. The sacrifices made by these nurses during the War in fact gave a boost to the women's suffrage movement in many of the countries that fought in the war. The Canadian Army nursing sisters were among the first women in the world to win the right to vote in a federal election; the Military Voters Act of 1917 extended the vote to women in the service such as Nursing Sisters.\n\n====Australia====\n{{Main|Australian Army Nursing Service}}\n[[Image:Grace Wilson on Lemnos.jpg|thumb|right|Sister [[Grace Wilson]] of the 3rd Australian General Hospital on [[Lemnos]].

The [[First Australian Imperial Force|AIF]] Project.</ref>]]\nAustralian nurses served in the war as part of the [[List of Australian Army medical units in World War I#Australian General Hospital|Australian General Hospital]]. Australia established two hospitals at [[Lemnos]] and Heliopolis Islands to support the Dardanelles campaign at Gallipoli. Nursing recruitment was sporadic, with some reserve nurses sent with the advance parties to set up the transport ship HMAS ''Gascoyne'' while others simply fronted to Barracks and were accepted, while still others were expected to pay for their passage in steerage. Australian nurses from this period became known as \"grey ghosts\" because of their drab uniforms with starched collar and cuffs.\n\nDuring the course of the war, Australian nurses were granted their own administration rather than working under medical officers. Australian Nurses hold the record for the maximum number of triage cases processed by a casualty station in a twenty-four-hour period during the [[battle of Passchendale]]. Their work routinely included administering ether during haemostatic surgery and managing and training medical assistants (orderlies).<ref>Guns and Brooches: Australian Army Nursing Boer - Gulf War by Jan Bassett</ref>\n\nSome 560 Australian army nurses served in India during the war, where they had to overcome a debilitating climate, outbreaks of disease, insufficient numbers, overwork and hostile British Army officers.<ref>Ruth Rae, \"Reading between Unwritten Lines: Australian Army Nurses in India, 1916\u201319\", '' Journal of the Australian War Memorial'' (2001), #36 pp. 1+</ref>\n\n===Interwar===\nSurveys in the U.S. showed that nurses often got married a few years after graduation and quit work; other waited 5 to 10 years for marriage; careerists some never married. By the 1920s increasing numbers of married nurses continued to work. The high turnover meant that advanvcement could be rapid; the average age of a nursing supervisor in a hospital was only 26 years. Wages for private duty nurses were high in the 1920s\u2014$1,300 a year when working full-time in patients' homes or at their private rooms in hospitals. This was more than double what a woman could earn as a teacher or in office work. Rates fell sharply when the Great Depression came in 1929, and continuous work was much harder to find.<ref>Susan Reverby, ''Ordered to Care'', pp. 98, 103, 105</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n\n====Canada====\nOver 4000 women served as nurses in uniform in the Canadian Armed Forces during the Second World War. They were called \"Nursing Sisters\" and had already been professionally trained in civilian life. However, in military service they achieved an elite status well above what they had experienced as civilians. The Nursing Sisters had much more responsibility and autonomy, and had more opportunity to use their expertise, then civilian nurses. They were often close to the front lines, and the military doctors \u2013 all men \u2013 delegated significant responsibility to the nurses because of the high level of casualties, the shortages of physicians, and extreme working conditions.<ref>Cynthia Toman, \"Front Lines and Frontiers: War as Legitimate Work for Nurses, 1939\u20131945,\" ''Social History/Histoire Sociale'' (2007) 40#79 pp. 45\u201374.</ref><ref>Cynthia Toman, ''An Officer and a Lady: Canadian Military Nursing and the Second World War'' (2007)</ref>\n\n====Australia====\n{{further|Australian Army Nursing Service}}\n[[File:Centaur (ARTV09088).png|thumb|right|Centaur poster]]\nIn 1942, sixty five front line nurses from the General Hospital Division in British Singapore were ordered aboard the Vyner Brook and Empire Star for evacuation, rather than caring for wounded. The ships were strafed with machine gun fire by Japanese planes. Sisters Vera Torney and Margaret Anderson were awarded medals when they could find nothing else on the crowded deck and covered their patients with their own bodies. A version of this action was honoured in the film [[Paradise Road (1997 film)|''Paradise Road'']]. The Vyner Brook was bombed and sank quickly in shallow water of the Sumatra Strait and all but twenty-one were lost at sea, presumed drowned. The remaining nurses swam ashore at Mentok, [[Sumatra]]. The twenty-one nurses and some British and Australian troops were marched into the sea and killed with machine gun fire in the [[Banka Island massacre]]. Sister [[Vivian Bullwinkel]] was the only survivor. She became Australia's premier nursing war hero when she nursed wounded British soldiers in the jungle for three weeks, despite her own flesh wound. She survived on the charity provided by Indonesian locals, but eventually hunger and the privations of hiding in mangrove swamp forced her to surrender. She remained imprisoned for the remainder of the war.\n\nAt around the same time, another group of twelve nurses stationed at the Rabaul mission in New Guinea were captured along with missionaries by invading Japanese troops and interred at their camp for two years. They cared for a number of British, Australian and American wounded. Toward the end of the war, they were transferred to a concentration camp in Kyoto and imprisoned under freezing conditions and forced into hard labour.\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 105020 Nurses of the Second A.I.F. leaving the Brisbane City Hall, 1940.jpg|thumb|right|Australian sisters]]\n\n====United States====\n\nAs Campbell (1984) shows, the nursing profession was transformed by World War Two.

(Nurses belonging to the QAIMNS are informally called \"QA\"s.) Members of the Army Nursing Service served in every overseas British military campaign during World War II, as well as at military hospitals in Britain. At the beginning of World War II, nurses held officer status with equivalent rank, but were not commissioned officers. In 1941, emergency commissions and a rank structure were created, conforming with the structure used in the rest of the British Army. Nurses were given rank badges and were now able to be promoted to ranks from Lieutenant through to Brigadier.<ref>{{cite web|title=QA World War Two Nursing|url=http://www.qaranc.co.uk/qa_world_war_two_nursing.php|publisher=qaranc.co.uk|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref> Nurses were exposed to all dangers during the War, and some were captured and became prisoners of war.\n\n====Germany====\nGermany had a very large and well organized nursing service, with three main organizations, one for Catholics, one for Protestants, and the DRK (Red Cross). In 1934 the Nazis set up their own nursing unit, the Brown Nurses, absorbing one of the smaller groups, bringing it up to 40,000 members. It set up kindergartens, hoping to seize control of the minds of the younger Germans, in competition with the other nursing organizations. Civilian psychiatric nurses who were Nazi party members participated in the killings of invalids, although the process was shrouded in euphemisms and denials.<ref>Bronny Rebekah McFarland-Icky, ''Nurses in Nazi Germany'' (Princeton University Press, 1999)</ref>\n\nMilitary nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Front line medical services were provided by male medics and doctors. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals that perforce were close to the front lines and at risk of bombing attacks. Two dozen were awarded the highly prestigious Iron Cross for heroism under fire. They are among the 470,000 German women who served with the military.<ref>Gordon Williamson, ''World War II German Women's Auxiliary Services'' (2003) pp. 34\u201336</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=24em}}\n* [[History of Nursing in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of nursing in the United States]]\n* [[History of Philippine nurses in the United States]]\n* [[Nursing in Australia]]\n* [[Nursing in Germany]]\n* [[Nursing in Canada#History]]\n* [[Nursing in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Nursing in India]]\n* [[Nursing in Japan]]\n* [[Nursing in Islam]]\n* [[Nursing in Kenya]]\n* [[Nursing in Pakistan]]\n* [[Nursing in the Philippines]]\n* [[Nursing in Taiwan]]\n* [[Nursing in Bangladesh]]\n* [[Nursing in the United States]]\n* [[List of nurses]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|24em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Andrist, Linda C. et al. eds.

Sindhis all over the world greet each other with the words, \"Jaiko chawando Jhulelal thenja thinde Beda-Paar\".\n\nAlthough the exact time and year of Jhulelal's incarnation is not known, his birth year is estimated sometime in the middle of the 10th Century. It is widely believed among the Sindhis that the Water God incarnated as Jhulelal.\n\nAccording to tradition, a tyrannical ruler named Mirkh Shah from nearby [[Thatta]] ordered that local Sindhis to convert into Islam within 24 hours or sacrifice. Local Sindhis, fearful of this edict, prayed at the banks of the [[Indus River]], where they then saw a vision of the Sindhis deity [[Varuna]] who informed the worshippers that he would re-incarnate himself as an infant to be born in [[Nasirpur]] in order to deliver them from their hardships.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=The Supernatural in Nature of the Sindhi Tradition|url=http://www.sanskritimagazine.com/indian-religions/hinduism/supernatural-nature-sindhi-tradition/|publisher=Sanskriti Magazine|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=7 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nJhulelal was born on the first day of the Hindu month of [[Chaitra]].This day is celebrated by Sindhi Hindus as [[Cheti Chand]].<ref name=\"Ramey2008p8\"/><ref name=falzon159/><ref name=kumar120>{{cite book|author=P.

Upon calling for Jhulelal, the warrior on horseback appeared out of the river to appear to Ahirio with an accompanying army. Terrified, Ahirio begged Jhulelal to restrain his army. Jhulelal's army then disappeared back into the River Indus, while Ahirio went back to the palace to recount the story to Mirkhshah. Mirkhshah remained skeptical, but invited Jhulelal to his court. Jhulelal is then said to have vanished, leaving Mirkhshah enraged. Jhulelal's followers then rushed to the house in [[Nasarpur]] where Jhulelal was born, and found Jhulelal there as an infant. The infant consoled the distraught Sindhis and commanded them to assemble at a temple near the Indus River. Upon assembling, a firestorm broke out and engulfed Mirkhshah's palaces.

Local Sindhis, fearful of this edict, prayed at the banks of the [[Indus River]], where they then saw a vision of the Sindhis deity [[Varuna]] who informed the worshippers that he would re-incarnate himself as an infant to be born in [[Nasirpur]] in order to deliver them from their hardships.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=The Supernatural in Nature of the Sindhi Tradition|url=http://www.sanskritimagazine.com/indian-religions/hinduism/supernatural-nature-sindhi-tradition/|publisher=Sanskriti Magazine|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=7 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nJhulelal was born on the first day of the Hindu month of [[Chaitra]]..This day is celebrated by Sindhi Hindus as [[Cheti Chand]].<ref name=\"Ramey2008p8\"/><ref name=falzon159/><ref name=kumar120>{{cite book|author=P.

The high-density nature of the Circle line service meant that loading times were important; consequently all cars were fitted with four double sets of air-operated sliding doors per side. Seating was mainly transverse, and total seating capacity was 32 per car. The 106 DM cars (Nos 5501-5606) were each coupled to one of 106 T (Nos 6501-6606) forming semi-permanent two-car units, with an automatic coupler at each end. Three such units were then marshalled as six-car trains for normal service. The DM cars were slightly longer to accommodate the drivers' cabs, the saloon dimensions in all other respects being the same.\n\nTo replace the CO/CP stock on the [[Edgware Road tube station (Circle, District and Hammersmith & City lines)|Edgware Road]] to [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] section of the District line, a further eleven trains designated '''C77''' were ordered of identical layout.

A withdrawal was made every week or two weeks until 2014, but because of delays to the introduction of S7 Stock owing to modifications needed to be made to the [[London Underground S7 and S8 Stock|S8 Stock]], the withdrawal process was temporarily halted.\n\nOn 26 April 2013 the process resumed, with 5528+5588+5701 being transferred to Acton Works for removal from the system.

Trailer car 6585 underwent more substantial changes, with the transverse seating removed and replaced with longitudinal seating, and bulkheads redesigned to remove the illuminated advertisement panels.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hardy |first1=Brian |title=London Underground Rolling Stock |date=2002 |publisher=Capital Transport |isbn=1-85414-263-1 |edition=15th}}</ref>\n\nThe prototype unit was displayed to the public and entered service on 22 November 1989.

Although the [[Nuffield Organization]] was heavily involved in [[World War II|war work]] and a governmental ban existed on civilian car production, Morris Motors' vice chairman, [[Miles Thomas]], wanted to prepare the ground for new products to be launched as soon as the war was over.<ref name=\"issigonis\">{{Cite book| last=Bardsley | first=Gillian | title=Issigonis: The Official Biography | page= | publisher= Icon Books | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-84046-687-4}}</ref>{{rp|115}} Vic Oak, the company's chief engineer, had already brought to Thomas' attention a promising junior engineer, [[Alec Issigonis]], who had been employed at Morris since 1935 and specialised in [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] design,<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|85}} but he had frequently impressed Oak with his advanced ideas about car design in general.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|114}} Issigonis had come to Oak's particular attention with his work on the new [[Morris Ten#Morris Ten series M|Morris Ten]], which was in development during 1936/7. This was the first Morris to use [[Vehicle frame#Unibody|unitary construction]] and was conceived with [[Independent suspension|independent front suspension]]. Issigonis designed a coil-sprung wishbone system, which was later dropped on cost grounds. Although the design was later used on the [[MG Y-type]] and many other postwar [[MG Cars|MGs]], the Morris Ten entered production with a front [[beam axle]]. Despite his brief being to focus on the Ten's suspension, Issigonis had also drawn up a [[Rack and pinion#Steering|rack and pinion steering]] system for the car. Like his suspension design, this was not adopted, but resurfaced in the postwar years on the MG Y-type, but these ideas proved that he was the perfect candidate to lead the design work on a new advanced small car.\n\nWith virtually all resources required for the war effort, Thomas nonetheless approved the development of a new small family car that would replace the [[Morris Eight]]. Although Oak (and Morris's technical director, Sidney Smith) were in overall charge of the project, Issigonis  was ultimately responsible for the design, working with only two other [[Drafter|draughtsmen]].<ref name=\"minorbio\">{{Cite book| last=Wainwright | first=Martin | title=Morris Minor: The Biography | page= | publisher= Aurum | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-84513-509-6}}</ref>{{rp|60}} Thomas named the project 'Mosquito' and ensured that it remained as secret as possible,<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|117}} both from the [[Ministry of Supply]] and from company founder William Morris ([[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|Lord Nuffield]]), who was still chairman of Morris Motors, and as widely expected, would not look favourably on Issigonis' radical ideas.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|63}}\n\nIssigonis' overall concept was to produce a practical, economical, and affordable car for the general public that would equal, if not surpass, the convenience and design quality of a more expensive car. In later years he summed up his approach to the Minor; that he wanted to design an [[economy car]] that \"the average man would take pleasure in owning, rather than feeling of it as something he'd been sentenced to\" and \"people who drive small cars are the same size as those who drive large cars and they should not be expected to put up with claustrophobic interiors.\"<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} Issigonis wanted the car to be as spacious as possible for its size, and comfortable to drive for inexperienced motorists. Just as he would with the [[Mini]] 10 years later, he designed the Mosquito with excellent [[automobile handling|roadholding]] and accurate, quick steering, not with any pretence of making a [[sports car]], but to make it safe and easy to drive by everyone.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|302}}\n\n===Original design features===\nIssigonis' design included the same ideas he had proposed for the Ten before the war:<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} [[independent suspension]], [[Rack and pinion#Steering|rack and pinion steering]], and [[Vehicle frame#Unibody|unitary construction]]. In the case of the Mosquito, Issigonis was inspired by the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]],<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} a car he greatly admired, and he proposed using [[torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] on each wheel, as on the Citro\u00ebn, rather than the usual [[coil spring]] system. The French car, launched in 1934, had also been an early example of the use of rack and pinion steering.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|61}}\n\nNearly every feature of the Minor served the joint aims of good handling and maximum interior space. For example, Issigonis specified {{convert|14|in|adj=on}} wheels for the Mosquito. These were smaller than any other production car of the time (the existing Morris Eight had {{convert|17|in|adj=on}} wheels).<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} These small wheels reduced intrusion into the cabin space and minimised the car's [[unsprung mass]], giving better ride comfort and stability. For the same reasons, the wheels themselves were placed as far as possible towards each corner of the Mosquito's floorpan. The same went for the placement of the engine, as far as possible towards the front of the engine compartment.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|95}} Most cars of the time had a front beam axle, which forced the engine to be mounted behind the front axle line. While this meant that, with only a driver on board, the weight distribution was fairly even, when laden with passengers, cars often became severely tail-heavy, leading to unstable handling and [[understeer and oversteer|oversteer]]. The new Morris's independent suspension meant there was no front axle, allowing the engine to be placed low down and far forward. Putting the Mosquito's engine in the nose meant that the car was nose-heavy when lightly laden, leading to superior directional stability, and when fully laden it achieved nearly equal weight balance, so handling and grip remained good regardless of the load carried.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|62}} Placing the engine further forward also maximised cabin space.\n\nAs proposed by Issigonis, the engine itself was also radical, being a water-cooled [[flat-four engine|flat-four]] unit. One of Miles Thomas's few restrictions on the Mosquito project was that it had to have an engine that would not fall afoul of the British [[Tax horsepower#Britain|horsepower tax]], which taxed cars under a formula relating to their engine cylinder bore. At the same time, Thomas wanted the car to appeal to the all-important export markets, which had no such restrictions, and generally favoured larger-engined cars. Issigonis' solution was the flat-four engine, which could easily be produced in two versions \u2013 a narrow-bore 800-cc version for the British market and a wide-bore 1100-cc version for export.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|123}} Both versions would use identical parts, except for the actual cylinder blocks (which could still be produced on the same machinery) and the pistons. The flat-four layout reduced the overall length of the engine, further increasing potential cabin space, and reduced the car's centre of gravity for improved handling.\n\n===Pre-production changes===\nThe engine was to prove a step too far for the Mosquito project. As the car approached completion in 1946, the war was over and secrecy was no longer necessary or possible to maintain, as more and more Morris staff and executives had to be involved to start production. Many were pessimistic about the radical car's prospects and especially the huge cost in tooling up for a design that shared no parts with any existing Morris product. Lord Nuffield himself took a strong dislike to both the Mosquito and Issigonis, famously saying that the prototype resembled a poached egg.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|63}} Nuffield preferred to continue production of the conventional Morris Eight, which succeeded very well  before the war, with some minor styling and engineering improvements. He particularly objected to the Mosquito's expensive and unconventional engine design. Whatever Nuffield's personal views, all of the Mosquito's radical features were looking increasingly unlikely to be implemented while maintaining an acceptable final purchase price and without incurring too much setup costs at the Cowley factory. Thomas and Vic Oak drew up a plan to create a three-model range of cars using Issigonis' design - the Mosquito with an 800-cc engine, a mid-sized model (tentatively designated the Minor after a previous [[Morris Minor (1928)|small Morris]] launched in 1928) with an 1100-cc engine, and a new [[Morris Oxford]] with a 1500-cc version of the engine, all sharing different-sized variants of the same [[Car platform|platform]] and with sporting MG and luxury [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] versions to achieve further economies of scale.\n\nThere was also the matter of timing \u2013  a big rush existed for British manufacturers to get new models to market following the end of the war. [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] was known to be working on an all-new but [[Austin A40 Devon|conventional car]], which would be launched in 1947. The Mosquito was proposed for launch in 1949 and that deadline was appearing increasingly unlikely due to the untried nature of many of the car's features. The Morris board insisted on launching the Mosquito at the first postwar [[British International Motor Show|British Motor Show]] in October 1948.\n\nThis meant that several of Issigonis' proposals were reviewed \u2013 first the all-independent torsion bar suspension was changed for a torsion-sprung [[Beam axle|live rear axle]] and this was then substituted by a conventional [[leaf spring|leaf-sprung]] arrangement. All of Miles Thomas' suggestions for spreading the cost of developing the new car and broadening the design's appeal were treated sceptically by the Morris board and vetoed by Lord Nuffield. It became clear that the only way to overcome the personal and financial obstacles to the project was to adopt a lightly revised version of the Morris Eight's obsolete [[Flathead engine|side-valve]] engine.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|129}}  Thomas resigned his position at Morris Motors over the debacle.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|66}} Despite the changes the fundamental principles of Issigonis' concept \u2013 a spacious cabin, small wheels at each corner, a forward-placed engine, rack and pinion steering, and independent torsion-bar front suspension \u2013 remained.\n\nWhile Thomas had been battling for the Mosquito's future, Issigonis had been settling the car's styling. Although in his later career he became known for very functional designs, Issigonis was heavily influenced by the modern styling of American cars, especially the [[Packard Clipper]] and the [[Buick Super]].<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|62}} A new feature was a low-set headlamps, integral with the grille panel (Issigonis had originally sketched [[Hidden headlamp|hidden lamps]] concealed behind sections of the grille, but these were never implemented). The original Mosquito prototype, which drew Lord Nuffield's \"poached egg\" comment, was designed with similar proportions to prewar cars, being relatively narrow for its length. In late 1947, with Cowley already tooling up for production, Issigonis was unhappy with the appearance of the car. He had the prototype cut lengthways and the two halves moved apart until it looked \"right\".<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|128}} The production model was thus 4 inches (10&nbsp;cm) wider than the prototype, and in keeping with Issigonis' design principles, this further improved interior space and roadholding. It also gave the car distinctive (and recognisably modern) proportions \u2013 contrast with the [[Austin A30]], launched in 1952, but still recognisably prewar in size and proportions. The last-minute change to the design required a number of workarounds \u2013 [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] had already been produced, so early cars had ones cut in half with a four-inch plate bolted between the joint.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|129}} The bonnet had a flat fillet section added to its centreline and the floorpan had two two-inch sections added either side of the transmission tunnel.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|68}}\n\n===From Mosquito to Minor===\nThe last change made was to the car's name. The Mosquito codename was widely expected to be the name of the production model, but Nuffield disliked it. Also, Issigonis' last-minute size increase and the fitment of the larger-than-planned sidevalve engine needed to be considered; while still a small car, the new Morris was no longer the ultra-compact [[economy car]] that it had been on the drawing board, and the Mosquito name seemed inappropriate. Morris's marketing department wanted a reassuring name for what it worried would be an innovative, radical car that would be difficult to sell to a cautious public.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|66}} So, the Minor name, intended for the midsized model in Thomas' planned trio of new cars, was adopted for what would become the smallest postwar Morris. The original 1928 Morris Minor had itself introduced a number of innovative features and had been the first four-wheeled car to sell for \u00a3100.\n\nThe new Morris Minor was launched at the British Motor Show at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] in London on 27 October 1948. The original range consisted solely of a two-door saloon or a two-door tourer with a 918-cc engine and a starting price of \u00a3358. At the same show, Morris also launched the new [[Morris Oxford MO|Morris Oxford]] and [[Morris Six MS|Morris Six]] models, plus Wolseley variants of both cars, which were scaled-up versions of the new Minor, incorporating all the same features and designed with Issigonis' input under Oak's supervision. Thus, Issigonis' ideas and design principles underpinned the complete postwar Morris and Wolseley car ranges, although not the same extent that Miles Thomas had initially proposed.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|125}}\n\n==Minor MM==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | name       = Morris Minor MM\n | image      = File:Morris Minor MM (low-lights) 1950 moving.JPG\n | caption    = Morris Minor MM 2-door Saloon\n | production = 1948\u201353; 250,962 produced\n | assembly = {{Plainlist|\n*[[Oxford]], England\n*[[Victoria Park Racecourse, Sydney|Victoria Park]], Australia<ref name=Anderson>Barry Anderson, Building Cars in Australia: Morris, Austin, BMC and Leyland 1950\u20131975, pages 204 to 208</ref>\n }}\n | engine     = 918&nbsp;cc ''Morris Sidevalve'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n | body_style = {{Plainlist|\n*2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]\n*4-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]\n*2-door [[convertible (car)|tourer]]\n }}\n | wheelbase  = {{Convert|86|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"autominded.net\">http://www.autominded.net/brochure/morris/Morris%201617.jpg</ref>\n | length     = {{Convert|148|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\nThe original Minor MM series was produced from 1948 until 1953. It included a pair of four-seat [[sedan (car)|saloons]], two-door and (from 1950) a four-door, and a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] four-seat Tourer. The front [[torsion bar]] suspension was shared with the larger [[Morris Oxford MO]], as was the almost-[[unibody]] construction. Although the Minor was originally designed to accept a [[flat-4]] engine, late in the development stage it was replaced by a {{convert|918|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[Flathead engine|side-valve]] [[inline-four engine]], little changed from that fitted in the early 1930s Morris Minor and Morris 8, with a bore of 57&nbsp;mm but with the stroke of 90&nbsp;mm and not 83&nbsp;mm, and producing 27.5&nbsp;hp (21&nbsp;kW) and 39&nbsp;lbf\u00b7ft (50.3&nbsp;N\u00b7m) of [[torque]].

This widening of 4&nbsp;inches (102&nbsp;mm) is also visible in the creases in the [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]]. Exports to the United States began in 1949 with the headlamps removed from within the grille surround to be mounted higher on the [[Fender (vehicle)|wings]] to meet local safety requirements. In 1950 a four-door version was released, initially available only for export, and featuring from the start the headlamps faired into the wings rather than set lower down on either side of the grille.<ref name=\"Autocar1950\">{{cite journal |title =Morris Minor Four-Door Saloon (road test)| journal =[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]| volume = | pages =  | date = 20 October 1950}}</ref>  The raised headlight position became standard on all Minors in time for 1951.<ref name=\"Autocar1950\"/> From the start, the Minor had semaphore-type turn indicators, and subsequent Minor versions persisted with these until 1961.<ref name=\"Willson 1995\"/> An ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'' magazine road test in 1950 reported that these were \"not of the usual self-cancelling type, but incorporate[d] a time-basis return mechanism in a switch below the facia, in front of the driver\".<ref name=\"Autocar1950\"/> It was all too easy for a passenger hurriedly emerging from the front passenger seat to collide with and snap off a tardy indicator \"flipper\" that was still sticking out of the B-pillar, having not yet been safely returned by the time-basis return mechanism to its folded position.\nAnother innovation towards the end of 1950 was a water pump (replacing a gravity dependent system), which permitted the manufacturer to offer an interior heater \"as optional equipment\".<ref name=\"Autocar1950\"/>\n\nWhen production of the first series ended, just over a quarter of a million had been sold, 30% of them the convertible Tourer model.\n\nA 918&nbsp;cc-engined tourer tested by the British magazine ''[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]'' in 1950 had a top speed of {{convert |58.7|mph|km/h|abbr =on}} and could accelerate from 0\u2013{{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 29.2&nbsp;seconds.

As part of a rationalisation programme to reduce the production of duplicate components for similar vehicles, the Minor drivetrain was completely replaced with an Austin-derived engine, gearbox, propshaft, differential and axle casing. The more modern [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]]-designed {{convert|803|cc|cid|abbr=on}} overhead valve [[BMC A-Series engine|A-series]] engine, which had been designed for the Minor's main rival, the [[Austin A30]], was smaller in all dimensions, but nevertheless gave noticeable performance improvements over the pre-war side-valve {{convert|918|cc|cid|abbr=on}} Morris unit it replaced. The 52&nbsp;second drive to 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) was still calm, but top speed increased to 63&nbsp;mph (101&nbsp;km/h). Fuel consumption also rose to {{convert|36|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}}.\n\nAn estate version was introduced in 1952, known as the Traveller (a Morris naming tradition for estates, also seen on the [[Mini]]). The Traveller featured an external structural [[Fraxinus|ash]] (wood) frame for the rear bodywork, with two side-hinged rear doors. The frame was varnished rather than painted and a highly visible feature of the body style. Travellers were built alongside the saloon model at Cowley minus their rear bodies. The half-completed cars were then shipped to the [[MG Cars|MG]] factory at [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] where the bodies (built in [[Coventry]]) would be mated to the chassis and the final assembly carried out. This was because the main Cowley production lines were no longer fully equipped to deal with body-on-frame vehicles such as the Traveller while the MG lines still handled these sorts of cars and had experience working with wood-framed bodies. Commercial models, marketed as the Morris Quarter Ton Van and Pick-up were added in May 1953.<ref name=Newell>Ray Newell, Morris Minor, 60 Years on the Road, pages 106 to 118</ref> Rear bodies of the van versions were all steel. The four-seat convertible and saloon variants continued as well.\n\n''[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]'' magazine tested a four-door saloon in 1952.

Where previously the Minor had been offered with a broad range of colours and trim options, the 'Minor 1000' (so named for its 948cc engine) shifted emphasis towards rationalisation of components to access improved economies of scale, and thus enabled increased production volumes to help the Minor retain a significant share of the small car market during a period where car ownership was becoming more commonplace.\n\nThe dawn of the motorway era necessitated the fitting of a new [[BMC A-Series engine#948|948cc]] (57.9 cu in) variant of the [[BMC A-Series engine]], elevating top speed from 63&nbsp;mph to 75&nbsp;mph, and reducing 0-60&nbsp;mph acceleration from 52.5 secs to 31.3 secs.<ref>http://www.gbclassiccars.co.uk/morris_minor.html</ref> Driving was further improved by a substantially revised gearbox, which incorporated taller ratios for more relaxed cruising speeds and a remote selector allowing a shorter gear lever and less ponderous gearchange action. This new engine and gearbox was the product of a broader engine policy at BMC, and had been developed for use in a range of their smaller vehicles, including the [[Austin A35]], [[Austin A40 Farina|A40 Farina]], and [[Austin-Healey Sprite]]/[[MG Midget]], to maximise parts sharing and thus reduce production costs, servicing costs and consumer costs across the model range.\n\nA series of changes to the body pressings for the roof/scuttle and bonnet panels yielded a large wraparound rear windscreen and one-piece curved front windscreen, which markedly improved visibility and lent a modernised appearance to the car at relatively small outlay.\n\nMany of the 'luxury' items, such as leather trim, were replaced with more durable and cheaper materials, and over the course of the following years the range of available paint and interior colours was dramatically reduced. Various unique Minor trim items and components (such as light units and heaters) were also gradually replaced with ubiquitous items from the BMC range. This programme of changes succeeded in giving access to improved economies of scale to allow production to be ramped up. By the turn of the 1960s, over 100,000 Minors were being produced per year, compared to fewer than 50,000 per year a decade earlier.<ref name=\"morrisminorspares.com\">http://www.morrisminorspares.com/production-figures-i19</ref>\n\nIn 1961 the [[flag semaphore|semaphore]]-style [[trafficators]] were replaced by [[Turn signal|flashing direction indicators]]. These were US-style red at the rear (using the same bulb filament as the brake lamp) and white at the front (using a second brighter filament in the parking lamp bulb) which was legal in the UK and many export markets at the time (such as New Zealand). On the two door cars, the rear wings were modified to remove the openings for the trafficators; on the 4-door, the B-pillar pressing was modified to leave a \u2018blank\u2019 in place of the trafficator housing.\n\nAn upmarket car based on the Minor floorpan using the larger [[BMC B-Series engine]] was sold as the [[Riley One-Point-Five]]/Wolseley 1500 beginning in 1957: versions of this Wolseley/Riley variant were also produced by [[BMC Australia]] as the [[Morris Major]] and the [[Austin Lancer]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\n1960 Morris Minor 1000 2-door sedan (26676151933).jpg|Morris Minor 1000 2-door saloon\n1962 Morris Minor 1000 sedan (18823882102).jpg|Morris Minor 1000 4-door saloon\nMorris Minor 1000 01.JPG|Morris Minor 1000 Convertible\nTraveller (4196830669).jpg|Morris Minor 1000 Traveller<br>(registered February 1966)\nMorris Minor Emblem.jpg|Morris Minor bonnet ornament\nMM1000 4DS 1956 06 innen 2005.jpg|Interior\n</gallery>\n{{clear_left}}\n\n===Minor Million===\nIn December 1960 the Morris Minor became the first British car to sell more than 1,000,000 units. To commemorate the achievement, a limited edition of 350 two-door Minor saloons (one for each UK Morris dealership) was produced with distinctive lilac paintwork and a white interior. Also the badge name on the side of the bonnet was modified to read \"Minor 1,000,000\" instead of the standard \"Minor 1000\". The millionth Minor was donated to the [[National Union of Journalists]], which planned to use it as a prize in a competition in aid of the union's Widow and Orphan Fund. The company, at the same time, presented a celebratory Minor to London's [[Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children]], but this car was constructed of cake.<ref name = PracticalMotorist196103>{{cite journal |title=News Summary: Morris Minor Million |journal=Practical Motorist |volume=7 |number=79 |page=713 |date=March 1961}}</ref>\n\n===Series V (ADO59)===\nThe final major upgrades to the Minor were made in 1962. Although the name ''Minor 1000'' was retained, the changes were sufficient for the new model to be given its own [[British Motor Corporation#BMC project numbers|ADO development number]]. Morris chassis numbering convention refers to these cars as 'Series V', the 'Series IV' designation having been assigned to the [[Mini#Mark I Mini: 1959\u201367|Morris Mini Minor]].<ref name=\"potteries.mmoc.org.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://potteries.mmoc.org.uk/Identify.htm|title=Welcome to the Website for the Potteries branch of the Morris Minor Owners Club|website=potteries.mmoc.org.uk|access-date=13 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nA new, larger version of the existing [[BMC A-Series engine#1098|A-Series]] engine had been developed in conjunction with cylinder head specialist [[Weslake|Harry Weslake]] for the then new [[BMC ADO16|ADO16]] Austin/Morris 1100 range. This new engine used a taller block than the 948&nbsp;cc unit, with increased bore and stroke bringing total capacity up to 1,098&nbsp;cc. Although fuel consumption suffered moderately at 38&nbsp;mpg, the Minor's top speed increased to 77&nbsp;mph (124&nbsp;km/h), and a 20% increase in torque<ref name=\"potteries.mmoc.org.uk\"/> gave an altogether more responsive drive. The revised engine was teamed to a stronger gearbox fitted with [[Manual transmission#Synchromesh|baulk ring synchromesh]] replacing the previous cone-clutch type. Drum brakes were retained on each corner, but the front units were increased from 7 inches (18&nbsp;cm) to 8 inches (20&nbsp;cm) in diameter. Other changes included a modified dashboard with toggle switches, white-on-black speedometer unit (incorporating a warning light for a blocked oil filter), textured alloy fascia, and a new glove-box cover design (a fully enclosing bottom-hinged cover on the passenger side, and fixed open aperture surround on the driver's side). A two-spoke 'safety' steering wheel (shared with the [[BMC ADO16|Morris 1100]]) and new heater (now with fresh air ventilation) were fitted in 1964, completing the interior upgrade. Larger combined front side/indicator light units, common to many [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] vehicles of the time, were fitted to the front wings, and larger tail lamp units were fitted at the rear. Both incorporated separate amber flashers for directional indicators.\n\nFrom 1965, no further production improvements were made to the Minor,<ref>http://mmoc-ni.co.uk/2012/12/03/minor-history/</ref> with resource being channelled into improving the [[BMC ADO16|ADO16]] (the Minor's spiritual successor and Britain's best-selling car in the 1960s), and development of the [[Morris Marina]], which would succeed the Minor on the Cowley production lines in 1971.\n\nIn 1969, production of the Traveller variants was moved to the ex-[[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] plant at [[Adderley Park]], where the van and pick-up models were already made. This freed up production space at [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] and simplified the production chain as the Traveller's rear bodies were built at the Morris Bodies factory in [[Coventry]]. Adderley Park-built Travellers were offered in a new range of colours from the paint range that had been introduced for 1970, including vibrant shades such as Limeflower ([[lime green]]) and Aqua ([[turquoise]]). From 1971 Minors were fitted with a steering-column mounted ignition key and a steering lock rather than the facia-mounted ignition switch used up to that point.\n\n;Engines\n*1956\u201362 (Series III): 948 cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine#948|A-series]]'' [[Inline-four engine|inline-four]], 37&nbsp;bhp (28&nbsp;kW) at 4,750&nbsp;rpm and 50&nbsp;lb/ft (68&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 2,500&nbsp;rpm\n*1962\u201372 (Series V): 1,098 cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine#1098|A-series]]'' inline-four, 48&nbsp;bhp (36&nbsp;kW) at 5,100&nbsp;rpm and 60&nbsp;lb/ft (81&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 2,500&nbsp;rpm<ref name=\"potteries.mmoc.org.uk\"/>\n\n==Decline and replacement==\nDuring the life of the Minor 1000 model, production declined &ndash; as the [[Mini]] and [[BMC ADO16|1100/1300]] had become BMC's best selling models by the mid 1960s.\n\nThe last Convertible/Tourer was manufactured on 18 August 1969,<ref name =Motor196908>{{Cite journal | authorlink = Charles Bulmer (Ed)| title = News: Last Minor Convertible sold | journal = [[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]| volume = 3506| page = 52 |date = 30 August 1969}}</ref> and the saloon models were discontinued in November 1970. Production of the more practical Traveller and commercial versions ceased in April 1971. According to Newell (1997), 1.6 million&nbsp;Minors were made in total and Wainwright (2008) even claims that 1,619,857 Minors of all variants were ultimately sold.<ref>[https://www.aronline.co.uk/cars/morris/minor/]</ref>\n\n===The Minor vs Volkswagen===\nThe decline and cancellation of Minor production was source of some consternation by industry commentators in the late 1960s,<ref name=\"Cowin, Chris 2012\">Cowin, Chris (2012), ''British Leyland: Chronicle of a Car Crash'' ({{ISBN|9781477560679}}) p.57</ref> who believed that further development of the car had the potential to challenge the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] in export markets. The Volkswagen, which was developed as a small family car with a very similar brief to the Minor, had been upgraded consistently over 25 years, and retained a healthy market share in export markets (especially developing countries), where it was very often the lowest priced new car on the market.<ref>Howard, Tony (December 1976). \"New VWs reflect determinedly cheerful mood\".

Van versions were popular with the [[General Post Office]], the early versions of these (to around 1956) having rubber front wings to cope with the sometimes unforgiving busy situations in which they were expected to work. Both the van and the pickup differed from the monocoque construction of the Saloon and Traveller variants by having a separate chassis. They also differed in details such as telescopic rear dampers, stiffer rear leaf springs and lower-ratio differentials to cope with heavier loads.\n\nThe commercial versions were initially marketed as the Morris Quarter Ton Van and Pick-up, with a Series III designation applied from 1956.<ref name=Newell/> The names Morris 6cwt Van and Pickup was used following the introduction of the 1098cc engine in 1962<ref name=Newell/> and 8cwt versions were added in 1968.<ref name=Newell/><ref>A [[Hundredweight|Cwt]] was the short-form term for a \"hundredweight\" which was a pre-metric unit of weight measurement used in Britain, equivalent to about 50&nbsp;kg.

The enduring affection for the \"Moggie\" (also a common British nickname for an undistinguished cat, or a [[Morgan Motor Company|Morgan]]) or \"Morrie\" (as it is often known in Australia and New Zealand) is reflected in the number of restored and improved Morris Minors currently running in Britain and [[Australasia]]. In addition to more powerful engines, desirable improvements necessitated by the increase in traffic density since the Minor was withdrawn from volume production include the replacement of the original equipment drum brakes with [[disc brake|discs]]. Other important upgrades include the {{convert|1275|cc|cid|abbr=on}} version of the [[BMC A-Series engine|A-series]] engine, derided by [[Morris Marina]] enthusiasts as a key reason why many Marinas were scrapped, and the similarly sized [[Nissan A engine]], which shares all common dimensions to the Morris Minor engine, except piston size. ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]] once stated that the Morris Minor is Britain's [[Volkswagen Beetle]] (although this was meant in a derogatory way rather than favourably).

Although the [[Nuffield Organization]] was heavily involved in [[World War II|war work]] and a governmental ban existed on civilian car production, Morris Motors' vice chairman, [[Miles Thomas]], wanted to prepare the ground for new products to be launched as soon as the war was over.<ref name=\"issigonis\">{{Cite book| last=Bardsley | first=Gillian | title=Issigonis: The Official Biography | page= | publisher= Icon Books | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-84046-687-4}}</ref>{{rp|115}} Vic Oak, the company's chief engineer, had already brought to Thomas' attention a promising junior engineer, [[Alec Issigonis]], who had been employed at Morris since 1935 and specialised in [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] design,<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|85}} but he had frequently impressed Oak with his advanced ideas about car design in general.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|114}} Issigonis had come to Oak's particular attention with his work on the new [[Morris Ten#Morris Ten series M|Morris Ten]], which was in development during 1936/7. This was the first Morris to use [[Vehicle frame#Unibody|unitary construction]] and was conceived with [[Independent suspension|independent front suspension]]. Issigonis designed a coil-sprung wishbone system, which was later dropped on cost grounds. Although the design was later used on the [[MG Y-type]] and many other postwar [[MG Cars|MGs]], the Morris Ten entered production with a front [[beam axle]]. Despite his brief being to focus on the Ten's suspension, Issigonis had also drawn up a [[Rack and pinion#Steering|rack and pinion steering]] system for the car. Like his suspension design, this was not adopted, but resurfaced in the postwar years on the MG Y-type, but these ideas proved that he was the perfect candidate to lead the design work on a new advanced small car.\n\nWith virtually all resources required for the war effort, Thomas nonetheless approved the development of a new small family car that would replace the [[Morris Eight]]. Although Oak (and Morris's technical director, Sidney Smith) were in overall charge of the project, Issigonis  was ultimately responsible for the design, working with only two other [[Drafter|draughtsmen]].<ref name=\"minorbio\">{{Cite book| last=Wainwright | first=Martin | title=Morris Minor: The Biography | page= | publisher= Aurum | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-84513-509-6}}</ref>{{rp|60}} Thomas named the project 'Mosquito' and ensured that it remained as secret as possible,<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|117}} both from the [[Ministry of Supply]] and from company founder William Morris ([[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|Lord Nuffield]]), who was still chairman of Morris Motors, and as widely expected, would not look favourably on Issigonis' radical ideas.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|63}}\n\nIssigonis' overall concept was to produce a practical, economical, and affordable car for the general public that would equal, if not surpass, the convenience and design quality of a more expensive car. In later years he summed up his approach to the Minor; that he wanted to design an [[economy car]] that \"the average man would take pleasure in owning, rather than feeling of it as something he'd been sentenced to\" and \"people who drive small cars are the same size as those who drive large cars and they should not be expected to put up with claustrophobic interiors.\"<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} Issigonis wanted the car to be as spacious as possible for its size, and comfortable to drive for inexperienced motorists. Just as he would with the [[Mini]] 10 years later, he designed the Mosquito with excellent [[automobile handling|roadholding]] and accurate, quick steering, not with any pretence of making a [[sports car]], but to make it safe and easy to drive by everyone.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|302}}\n\n===Original design features===\nIssigonis' design included the same ideas he had proposed for the Ten before the war:<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} [[independent suspension]], [[Rack and pinion#Steering|rack and pinion steering]], and [[Vehicle frame#Unibody|unitary construction]]. In the case of the Mosquito, Issigonis was inspired by the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]],<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} a car he greatly admired, and he proposed using [[torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] on each wheel, as on the Citro\u00ebn, rather than the usual [[coil spring]] system. The French car, launched in 1934, had also been an early example of the use of rack and pinion steering.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|61}}\n\nNearly every feature of the Minor served the joint aims of good handling and maximum interior space. For example, Issigonis specified {{convert|14|in|adj=on}} wheels for the Mosquito. These were smaller than any other production car of the time (the existing Morris Eight had {{convert|17|in|adj=on}} wheels).<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|121}} These small wheels reduced intrusion into the cabin space and minimised the car's [[unsprung mass]], giving better ride comfort and stability. For the same reasons, the wheels themselves were placed as far as possible towards each corner of the Mosquito's floorpan. The same went for the placement of the engine, as far as possible towards the front of the engine compartment.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|95}} Most cars of the time had a front beam axle, which forced the engine to be mounted behind the front axle line. While this meant that, with only a driver on board, the weight distribution was fairly even, when laden with passengers, cars often became severely tail-heavy, leading to unstable handling and [[understeer and oversteer|oversteer]]. The new Morris's independent suspension meant there was no front axle, allowing the engine to be placed low down and far forward. Putting the Mosquito's engine in the nose meant that the car was nose-heavy when lightly laden, leading to superior directional stability, and when fully laden it achieved nearly equal weight balance, so handling and grip remained good regardless of the load carried.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|62}} Placing the engine further forward also maximised cabin space.\n\nAs proposed by Issigonis, the engine itself was also radical, being a water-cooled [[flat-four engine|flat-four]] unit. One of Miles Thomas's few restrictions on the Mosquito project was that it had to have an engine that would not fall afoul of the British [[Tax horsepower#Britain|horsepower tax]], which taxed cars under a formula relating to their engine cylinder bore. At the same time, Thomas wanted the car to appeal to the all-important export markets, which had no such restrictions, and generally favoured larger-engined cars. Issigonis' solution was the flat-four engine, which could easily be produced in two versions \u2013 a narrow-bore 800-cc version for the British market and a wide-bore 1100-cc version for export.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|123}} Both versions would use identical parts, except for the actual cylinder blocks (which could still be produced on the same machinery) and the pistons. The flat-four layout reduced the overall length of the engine, further increasing potential cabin space, and reduced the car's centre of gravity for improved handling.\n\n===Pre-production changes===\nThe engine was to prove a step too far for the Mosquito project. As the car approached completion in 1946, the war was over and the need for secrecy was both no longer necessary and impossible to maintain, as more and more Morris staff and executives had to be involved to start production. Many were pessimistic about the radical car's prospects and especially the huge cost in tooling up for a design that shared no parts with any existing Morris product. Lord Nuffield himself took a strong dislike to both the Mosquito and Issigonis, famously saying that the prototype resembled a poached egg.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|63}} Nuffield preferred to continue production of the conventional Morris Eight, which succeeded very well  before the war, with some minor styling and engineering improvements. He particularly objected to the Mosquito's expensive and unconventional engine design. Whatever Nuffield's personal views, all of the Mosquito's radical features were looking increasingly unlikely to be implemented while maintaining an acceptable final purchase price and without incurring too much setup costs at the Cowley factory. Thomas and Vic Oak drew up a plan to create a three-model range of cars using Issigonis' design - the Mosquito with an 800-cc engine, a mid-sized model (tentatively designated the Minor after a previous [[Morris Minor (1928)|small Morris]] launched in 1928) with an 1100-cc engine, and a new [[Morris Oxford]] with a 1500-cc version of the engine, all sharing different-sized variants of the same [[Car platform|platform]] and with sporting MG and luxury [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] versions to achieve further economies of scale.\n\nThere was also the matter of timing \u2013  a big rush existed for British manufacturers to get new models to market following the end of the war. [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] was known to be working on an all-new but [[Austin A40 Devon|conventional car]], which would be launched in 1947. The Mosquito was proposed for launch in 1949 and that deadline was appearing increasingly unlikely due to the untried nature of many of the car's features. The Morris board insisted on launching the Mosquito at the first postwar [[British International Motor Show|British Motor Show]] in October 1948.\n\nThis meant that several of Issigonis' proposals were reviewed \u2013 first the all-independent torsion bar suspension was changed for a torsion-sprung [[Beam axle|live rear axle]] and this was then substituted by a conventional [[leaf spring|leaf-sprung]] arrangement. All of Miles Thomas' suggestions for spreading the cost of developing the new car and broadening the design's appeal were treated sceptically by the Morris board and vetoed by Lord Nuffield. It became clear that the only way to overcome the personal and financial obstacles to the project was to adopt a lightly revised version of the Morris Eight's obsolete [[Flathead engine|side-valve]] engine.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|129}}  Thomas resigned his position at Morris Motors over the debacle.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|66}} Despite the changes the fundamental principles of Issigonis' concept \u2013 a spacious cabin, small wheels at each corner, a forward-placed engine, rack and pinion steering, and independent torsion-bar front suspension \u2013 remained.\n\nWhile Thomas had been battling for the Mosquito's future, Issigonis had been settling the car's styling. Although in his later career he became known for very functional designs, Issigonis was heavily influenced by the modern styling of American cars, especially the [[Packard Clipper]] and the [[Buick Super]].<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|62}} A new feature was a low-set headlamps, integral with the grille panel (Issigonis had originally sketched [[Hidden headlamp|hidden lamps]] concealed behind sections of the grille, but these were never implemented). The original Mosquito prototype, which drew Lord Nuffield's \"poached egg\" comment, was designed with similar proportions to prewar cars, being relatively narrow for its length. In late 1947, with Cowley already tooling up for production, Issigonis was unhappy with the appearance of the car. He had the prototype cut lengthways and the two halves moved apart until it looked \"right\".<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|128}} The production model was thus 4 inches (10&nbsp;cm) wider than the prototype, and in keeping with Issigonis' design principles, this further improved interior space and roadholding. It also gave the car distinctive (and recognisably modern) proportions \u2013 contrast with the [[Austin A30]], launched in 1952, but still recognisably prewar in size and proportions. The last-minute change to the design required a number of workarounds \u2013 [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] had already been produced, so early cars had ones cut in half with a four-inch plate bolted between the joint.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|129}} The bonnet had a flat fillet section added to its centreline and the floorpan had two two-inch sections added either side of the transmission tunnel.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|68}}\n\n===From Mosquito to Minor===\nThe last change made was to the car's name. The Mosquito codename was widely expected to be the name of the production model, but Nuffield disliked it. Also, Issigonis' last-minute size increase and the fitment of the larger-than-planned sidevalve engine needed to be considered; while still a small car, the new Morris was no longer the ultra-compact [[economy car]] that it had been on the drawing board, and the Mosquito name seemed inappropriate. Morris's marketing department wanted a reassuring name for what it worried would be an innovative, radical car that would be difficult to sell to a cautious public.<ref name=\"minorbio\"/>{{rp|66}} So, the Minor name, intended for the midsized model in Thomas' planned trio of new cars, was adopted for what would become the smallest postwar Morris. The original 1928 Morris Minor had itself introduced a number of innovative features and had been the first four-wheeled car to sell for \u00a3100.\n\nThe new Morris Minor was launched at the British Motor Show at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] in London on 27 October 1948. The original range consisted solely of a two-door saloon or a two-door tourer with a 918-cc engine and a starting price of \u00a3358. At the same show, Morris also launched the new [[Morris Oxford MO|Morris Oxford]] and [[Morris Six MS|Morris Six]] models, plus Wolseley variants of both cars, which were scaled-up versions of the new Minor, incorporating all the same features and designed with Issigonis' input under Oak's supervision. Thus, Issigonis' ideas and design principles underpinned the complete postwar Morris and Wolseley car ranges, although not the same extent that Miles Thomas had initially proposed.<ref name=\"issigonis\"/>{{rp|125}}\n\n==Minor MM==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | name       = Morris Minor MM\n | image      = File:Morris Minor MM (low-lights) 1950 moving.JPG\n | caption    = Morris Minor MM 2-door Saloon\n | production = 1948\u201353; 250,962 produced\n | assembly = {{Plainlist|\n*[[Oxford]], England\n*[[Victoria Park Racecourse, Sydney|Victoria Park]], Australia<ref name=Anderson>Barry Anderson, Building Cars in Australia: Morris, Austin, BMC and Leyland 1950\u20131975, pages 204 to 208</ref>\n }}\n | engine     = 918&nbsp;cc ''Morris Sidevalve'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n | body_style = {{Plainlist|\n*2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]\n*4-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]\n*2-door [[convertible (car)|tourer]]\n }}\n | wheelbase  = {{Convert|86|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"autominded.net\">http://www.autominded.net/brochure/morris/Morris%201617.jpg</ref>\n | length     = {{Convert|148|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\nThe original Minor MM series was produced from 1948 until 1953.

The front [[torsion bar]] suspension was shared with the larger [[Morris Oxford MO]], as was the almost-[[unibody]] construction. Although the Minor was originally designed to accept a [[flat-4]] engine, late in the development stage it was replaced by a {{convert|918|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[Flathead engine|side-valve]] [[inline-four engine]], little changed from that fitted in the early 1930s Morris Minor and Morris 8, with a bore of 57&nbsp;mm but with the stroke of 90&nbsp;mm and not 83&nbsp;mm, and producing 27.5&nbsp;hp (21&nbsp;kW) and 39&nbsp;lbf\u00b7ft (50.3&nbsp;N\u00b7m) of [[torque]].

As part of a rationalisation programme to reduce the production of duplicate components for similar vehicles, the Minor drivetrain was completely replaced with an Austin-derived engine, gearbox, propshaft, differential and axle casing. The more modern [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]]-designed {{convert|803|cc|cid|abbr=on}} overhead valve [[BMC A-Series engine|A-series]] engine, which had been designed for the Minor's main rival, the [[Austin A30]], was smaller in all dimensions, but nevertheless gave noticeable performance improvements over the pre-war side-valve {{convert|918|cc|cid|abbr=on}} Morris unit it replaced. The 52&nbsp;second drive to 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) was still calm, but top speed increased to 63&nbsp;mph (101&nbsp;km/h). Fuel consumption also rose to {{convert|36|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}}.\n\nAn estate version was introduced in 1952, known as the Traveller (a Morris naming tradition for estates, also seen on the [[Mini]]). The Traveller featured an external structural [[Fraxinus|ash]] (wood) frame for the rear bodywork, with two side-hinged rear doors. The frame was varnished rather than painted and a highly visible feature of the body style. Travellers were built alongside the saloon model at Cowley minus their rear bodies. The half-completed cars were then shipped to the [[MG Cars|MG]] factory at [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] where the bodies (built in [[Coventry]]) would be mated to the chassis and the final assembly carried out. This was because the main Cowley production lines were no longer fully equipped to deal with body-on-frame vehicles such as the Traveller while the MG lines still handled these sorts of cars and had experience working with wood-framed bodies. Commercial models, marketed as the Morris Quarter Ton Van and Pick-up were added in May 1953.<ref name=Newell>Ray Newell, Morris Minor, 60 Years on the Road, pages 106 to 118</ref> Rear bodies of the van versions were all steel.

Where previously the Minor had been offered with a broad range of colours and trim options, the 'Minor 1000' (so named for its 948cc engine) shifted emphasis towards rationalisation of components to access improved economies of scale, and thus enabled increased production volumes to help the Minor retain a significant share of the small car market during a period where car ownership was becoming more commonplace.\n\nThe dawn of the motorway era necessitated the fitting of a new [[BMC A-Series engine#948|948cc]] (57.9 cu in) variant of the [[BMC A-Series engine]], elevating top speed from 63&nbsp;mph to 75&nbsp;mph, and reducing 0-60&nbsp;mph acceleration from 52.5 secs to 31.3 secs.<ref>http://www.gbclassiccars.co.uk/morris_minor.html</ref> Driving was further improved by a substantially revised gearbox, which incorporated taller ratios for more relaxed cruising speeds and a remote selector allowing a shorter gear lever and less ponderous gearchange action. This new engine and gearbox was the product of a broader engine policy at BMC, and had been developed for use in a range of their smaller vehicles, including the [[Austin A35]], [[Austin A40 Farina|A40 Farina]], and [[Austin-Healey Sprite]]/[[MG Midget]], to maximise parts sharing and thus reduce production costs, servicing costs and consumer costs across the model range.\n\nA series of changes to the body pressings for the roof/scuttle and bonnet panels yielded a large wraparound rear windscreen and one-piece curved front windscreen, which markedly improved visibility and lent a modernised appearance to the car at relatively small outlay.\n\nMany of the 'luxury' items, such as leather trim, were replaced with more durable and cheaper materials, and over the course of the following years the range of available paint and interior colours was dramatically reduced. Various unique Minor trim items and components (such as light units and heaters) were also gradually replaced with ubiquitous items from the BMC range. This programme of changes succeeded in giving access to improved economies of scale to allow production to be ramped up. By the turn of the 1960s, over 100,000 Minors were being produced per year, compared to fewer than 50,000 per year a decade earlier.<ref name=\"morrisminorspares.com\">http://www.morrisminorspares.com/production-figures-i19</ref>\n\nIn 1961 the [[flag semaphore|semaphore]]-style [[trafficators]] were replaced by [[Turn signal|flashing direction indicators]]. These were US-style red at the rear (using the same bulb filament as the brake lamp) and white at the front (using a second brighter filament in the parking lamp bulb) which was legal in the UK and many export markets at the time (such as New Zealand). On the two door cars, the rear wings were modified to remove the openings for the trafficators; on the 4-door, the B-pillar pressing was modified to leave a \u2018blank\u2019 in place of the trafficator housing.\n\nAn upmarket car based on the Minor floorpan using the larger [[BMC B-Series engine]] was sold as the [[Riley One-Point-Five]]/Wolseley 1500 beginning in 1957: versions of this Wolseley/Riley variant were also produced by [[BMC Australia]] as the [[Morris Major]] and the [[Austin Lancer]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\n1960 Morris Minor 1000 2-door sedan (26676151933).jpg|Morris Minor 1000 2-door saloon\n1962 Morris Minor 1000 sedan (18823882102).jpg|Morris Minor 1000 4-door saloon\nMorris Minor 1000 01.JPG|Morris Minor 1000 Convertible\nTraveller (4196830669).jpg|Morris Minor 1000 Traveller<br>(registered February 1966)\nMorris Minor Emblem.jpg|Morris Minor bonnet ornament\nMM1000 4DS 1956 06 innen 2005.jpg|Interior\n</gallery>\n{{clear_left}}\n\n===Minor Million===\nIn December 1960 the Morris Minor became the first British car to sell more than 1,000,000 units. To commemorate the achievement, a limited edition of 350 two-door Minor saloons (one for each UK Morris dealership) was produced with distinctive lilac paintwork and a white interior. Also the badge name on the side of the bonnet was modified to read \"Minor 1,000,000\" instead of the standard \"Minor 1000\". The millionth Minor was donated to the [[National Union of Journalists]], which planned to use it as a prize in a competition in aid of the union's Widow and Orphan Fund. The company, at the same time, presented a celebratory Minor to London's [[Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children]], but this car was constructed of cake.<ref name = PracticalMotorist196103>{{cite journal |title=News Summary: Morris Minor Million |journal=Practical Motorist |volume=7 |number=79 |page=713 |date=March 1961}}</ref>\n\n===Series V (ADO59)===\nThe final major upgrades to the Minor were made in 1962. Although the name ''Minor 1000'' was retained, the changes were sufficient for the new model to be given its own [[British Motor Corporation#BMC project numbers|ADO development number]]. Morris chassis numbering convention refers to these cars as 'Series V', the 'Series IV' designation having been assigned to the [[Mini#Mark I Mini: 1959\u201367|Morris Mini Minor]].<ref name=\"potteries.mmoc.org.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://potteries.mmoc.org.uk/Identify.htm|title=Welcome to the Website for the Potteries branch of the Morris Minor Owners Club|website=potteries.mmoc.org.uk|access-date=13 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nA new, larger version of the existing [[BMC A-Series engine#1098|A-Series]] engine had been developed in conjunction with cylinder head specialist [[Weslake|Harry Weslake]] for the then new [[BMC ADO16|ADO16]] Austin/Morris 1100 range. This new engine used a taller block than the 948&nbsp;cc unit, with increased bore and stroke bringing total capacity up to 1,098&nbsp;cc. Although fuel consumption suffered moderately at 38&nbsp;mpg, the Minor's top speed increased to 77&nbsp;mph (124&nbsp;km/h), and a 20% increase in torque<ref name=\"potteries.mmoc.org.uk\"/> gave an altogether more responsive drive. The revised engine was teamed to a stronger gearbox fitted with [[Manual transmission#Synchromesh|baulk ring synchromesh]] replacing the previous cone-clutch type. Drum brakes were retained on each corner, but the front units were increased from 7 inches (18&nbsp;cm) to 8 inches (20&nbsp;cm) in diameter. Other changes included a modified dashboard with toggle switches, white-on-black speedometer unit (incorporating a warning light for a blocked oil filter), textured alloy fascia, and a new glove-box cover design (a fully enclosing bottom-hinged cover on the passenger side, and fixed open aperture surround on the driver's side). A two-spoke 'safety' steering wheel (shared with the [[BMC ADO16|Morris 1100]]) and new heater (now with fresh air ventilation) were fitted in 1964, completing the interior upgrade. Larger combined front side/indicator light units, common to many [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] vehicles of the time, were fitted to the front wings, and larger tail lamp units were fitted at the rear. Both incorporated separate amber flashers for directional indicators.\n\nFrom 1965, no further production improvements were made to the Minor,<ref>http://mmoc-ni.co.uk/2012/12/03/minor-history/</ref> with resource being channelled into improving the [[BMC ADO16|ADO16]] (the Minor's spiritual successor and Britain's best-selling car in the 1960s), and development of the [[Morris Marina]], which would succeed the Minor on the Cowley production lines in 1971.\n\nIn 1969, production of the Traveller variants was moved to the ex-[[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] plant at [[Adderley Park]], where the van and pick-up models were already made. This freed up production space at [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] and simplified the production chain as the Traveller's rear bodies were built at the Morris Bodies factory in [[Coventry]]. Adderley Park-built Travellers were offered in a new range of colours from the paint range that had been introduced for 1970, including vibrant shades such as Limeflower ([[lime green]]) and Aqua ([[turquoise]]). From 1971 Minors were fitted with a steering-column mounted ignition key and a steering lock rather than the facia-mounted ignition switch used up to that point.\n\n;Engines\n*1956\u201362 (Series III): 948 cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine#948|A-series]]'' [[Inline-four engine|inline-four]], 37&nbsp;bhp (28&nbsp;kW) at 4,750&nbsp;rpm and 50&nbsp;lb/ft (68&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 2,500&nbsp;rpm\n*1962\u201372 (Series V): 1,098 cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine#1098|A-series]]'' inline-four, 48&nbsp;bhp (36&nbsp;kW) at 5,100&nbsp;rpm and 60&nbsp;lb/ft (81&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 2,500&nbsp;rpm<ref name=\"potteries.mmoc.org.uk\"/>\n\n==Decline and replacement==\nDuring the life of the Minor 1000 model, production declined &ndash; as the [[Mini]] and [[BMC ADO16|1100/1300]] had become BMC's best selling models by the mid 1960s.\n\nThe last Convertible/Tourer was manufactured on 18 August 1969,<ref name =Motor196908>{{Cite journal | authorlink = Charles Bulmer (Ed)| title = News: Last Minor Convertible sold | journal = [[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]| volume = 3506| page = 52 |date = 30 August 1969}}</ref> and the saloon models were discontinued in November 1970. Production of the more practical Traveller and commercial versions ceased in April 1971. According to Newell (1997), 1.6 million&nbsp;Minors were made in total and Wainwright (2008) even claims that 1,619,857 Minors of all variants were ultimately sold.<ref>[https://www.aronline.co.uk/cars/morris/minor/]</ref>\n\n===The Minor vs Volkswagen===\nThe decline and cancellation of Minor production was source of some consternation by industry commentators in the late 1960s,<ref name=\"Cowin, Chris 2012\">Cowin, Chris (2012), ''British Leyland: Chronicle of a Car Crash'' ({{ISBN|9781477560679}}) p.57</ref> who believed that further development of the car had the potential to challenge the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] in export markets. The Volkswagen, which was developed as a small family car with a very similar brief to the Minor, had been upgraded consistently over 25 years, and retained a healthy market share in export markets (especially developing countries), where it was very often the lowest priced new car on the market.<ref>Howard, Tony (December 1976). \"New VWs reflect determinedly cheerful mood\". SA Motor. Cape Town, South Africa: Scott Publications: 31\u201332.</ref> It went on to achieve over 21 million units before cancellation in 2003. Having said this, in the year of the Minor's cancellation (1971), over 1.3 million Beetles were produced (its peak year of production).<ref>https://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/info/beetle_productionfigures.php</ref> This corresponded to over 80% of total Minor production in 23 years, or ten times the production volume of Minors in their peak year (1958) when 113,699 were built.<ref name=\"morrisminorspares.com\"/> This gulf of production capacity made the Minor's ability to effectively challenge the Beetle, which had a global distributor and servicing network, moot. Some historians also report that the Minor was being sold at a loss during its final years.<ref name=\"Cowin, Chris 2012\"/> British Leyland management were pinning hopes for greater market share and profitability on the Morris Marina, which was being specifically developed for assembly on the Minor production lines at Cowley, thereby precluding the continuance of Minor production in any event.\n\n===Successors===\nThe Minor was officially replaced on the Cowley production lines by the [[Morris Marina]] (ADO28), which was developed primarily in response to Ford's top-selling (and in many respects, conservatively engineered) [[Ford Escort (Europe)#First generation (1967\u20131975)|Escort]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/2011/07/21/the-cars-bmc-18002200-development-history/ |title=The cars: BMC 1800/2200 development history |publisher=AROnline |date=11 April 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002180934/http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/2011/07/21/the-cars-bmc-18002200-development-history/ |archive-date=2 October 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Building a larger mid-sized car capable of volume sales (particularly in the lucrative fleet-buying market) was becoming increasingly key in maintaining healthy sales figures, and was an issue BMC had consistently failed to address hitherto.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aronline.co.uk/cars/morris/marina-ital/morris-marina-development-history/ |title=The cars : Morris Marina development story |publisher=AROnline |date=19 December 2017 |accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> The Marina was developed under the watchful eye of [[British Leyland]] management, and used a modified version of the Minor chassis floorplan, extended to increase the wheelbase by  10 inches.

The crisp styling, hydrolastic suspension and innovative front-wheel drive system (itself a \"scaling-up\" of the [[Mini]] principle) made ADO16 a worthy successor to the (in its day) strikingly forward-looking Minor. However, due to the British Motor Corporation's commitment to both the Morris factory at [[Plant Oxford|Cowley]], and [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] plant at [[Longbridge plant|Longbridge]]&nbsp;\u2013 in addition to a healthy demand for both products&nbsp;\u2013 production of the two cars continued in parallel for nearly 10 years. Indeed, production of ADO16 outlasted that of the Minor by only three years or so, before being replaced by the innovative, export-oriented, yet under-developed [[Austin Allegro]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/2011/08/27/the-cars-austin-allegro-development-history/ |title=Austin Allegro |publisher=AROnline |date=11 April 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531075600/http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/2011/08/27/the-cars-austin-allegro-development-history/ |archivedate=31 May 2012  }}</ref>\n\n==Safety==\nDespite the four major updates of the Minor in its 23-year production run, very few actively designed \"safety features\" were ever engineered into the Minor's design. Provisions were made for seat belt fittings in the early '60s, but the rigid structure of the car's monocoque body made it dangerously unabsorbent to impact.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} For a short time in 1968, the thickness of the steel used in the bonnet and doors was decreased from 1.2&nbsp;mm to 1.0&nbsp;mm to act as a form of [[crumple zone]], but as the wings continued to be made of 1.4&nbsp;mm mild steel, the modification was pointless and ineffectual and was reversed in 1969 as it increased passenger compartment crush in collisions.\n\nThe Mark II model changed from the \"lowlight\" model to comply with Canadian lighting standards, with higher and brighter headlights to increase visibility in fog and during dark Canadian winters.\n\nAustralian models, and tourer models made in Britain and exported to Australia, featured safety glass windscreens and safety glass windows, to comply with local regulations. Australian models also had blinking indicator lights in addition to the standard trafficator arms on the indigenous Minor 1000.\n\n==Morris quarter ton van and pick-up==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | name       = Morris Quarter Ton Van & Pick-up\n | aka = {{Plainlist|\n*Morris 6cwt/8cwt Van & Pick up\n*Austin 6cwt/8cwt Van & Pick up\n }}\n | image      = File:Morris 6 Cwt Van - Flickr - exfordy.jpg\n | caption    = Morris 6cwt Van\n | production = 1953\u201373<ref name=Newell/>\n | assembly = {{Plainlist|\n*England\n*Australia<ref name=Anderson />\n*New Zealand<ref name=Newell />\n*Denmark<ref name=Newell />\n }}\n | engine = {{Plainlist|\n*803&nbsp;cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine|A-series]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<ref name=Newell />\n*948&nbsp;cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine|A-series]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<ref name=Newell />\n*1,098&nbsp;cc ''[[BMC A-Series engine#1098|A-series]]'' I4<ref name=Newell />\n }}\n | body_style = {{Plainlist|\n*2-door [[van]]\n*2-door [[Pickup truck|pickup]]\n }}\n}}\nClosed van and open flat-bed (\"pick-up\") versions of the Minor were built from 1953 until the end of production. They were designed for commercial use with small businesses, although many were also used by larger corporations. Van versions were popular with the [[General Post Office]], the early versions of these (to around 1956) having rubber front wings to cope with the sometimes unforgiving busy situations in which they were expected to work. Both the van and the pickup differed from the monocoque construction of the Saloon and Traveller variants by having a separate chassis. They also differed in details such as telescopic rear dampers, stiffer rear leaf springs and lower-ratio differentials to cope with heavier loads.\n\nThe commercial versions were initially marketed as the Morris Quarter Ton Van and Pick-up, with a Series III designation applied from 1956.<ref name=Newell/> The names Morris 6cwt Van and Pickup was used following the introduction of the 1098cc engine in 1962<ref name=Newell/> and 8cwt versions were added in 1968.<ref name=Newell/><ref>A [[Hundredweight|Cwt]] was the short-form term for a \"hundredweight\" which was a pre-metric unit of weight measurement used in Britain, equivalent to about 50&nbsp;kg.  Use of the term in the name of a light commercial vehicle was common in Britain, and indicated the maximum load (by weight) that the van was designed to carry.</ref>\n\nAs BMC's policy was to provide both Austin and Morris with complete commercial vehicle ranges, Austin-badged variants of the Minor van and pick-up were sold following the end of [[Austin A35]] production in 1968. These featured Austin badging and the corporate Austin 'crinkle-cut' radiator grille but were otherwise identical to the standard Minor commercials, and were sold as the Austin 6cwt and Austin 8cwt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/commercials/ar-commercials-car-derived-vanspick-ups/ |title=Morris \u00bc-ton (O-Type) 1953\u20131971 |publisher=www.aronline.co.uk |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref> <gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:1962 Morris Minor 1000 pickup.jpg|1962 Morris 6cwt pick up\nFile:Austin 6cwt Van, pic1.JPG|Austin 6cwt Van\n1965 Morris 6CWT Van (11815570686).jpg|Morris 6cwt van\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Morris Minor today==\n[[File:Morrisrally.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|Morris Minor rally at [[Brooklands]], Surrey]]\n\nToday the Morris Minor and 1000 are among the best-served classic family-sized cars in the old vehicle movement and continue to gain popularity. The enduring affection for the \"Moggie\" (also a common British nickname for an undistinguished cat, or a [[Morgan Motor Company|Morgan]]) or \"Morrie\" (as it is often known in Australia and New Zealand) is reflected in the number of restored and improved Morris Minors currently running in Britain and [[Australasia]]. In addition to more powerful engines, desirable improvements necessitated by the increase in traffic density since the Minor was withdrawn from volume production include the replacement of the original equipment drum brakes with [[disc brake|discs]]. Other important upgrades include the {{convert|1275|cc|cid|abbr=on}} version of the [[BMC A-Series engine|A-series]] engine, derided by [[Morris Marina]] enthusiasts as a key reason why many Marinas were scrapped, and the similarly sized [[Nissan A engine]], which shares all common dimensions to the Morris Minor engine, except piston size. ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]] once stated that the Morris Minor is Britain's [[Volkswagen Beetle]] (although this was meant in a derogatory way rather than favourably). There is still an extensive parts backup for these cars, and parts are cheap compared to modern day cars.\n\nReplacement panels for the Morris Minor were still being made in 2002 by the Durable Car Company in Sri Lanka.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2492607.stm |title=2002 BBC article about the company and Morris Minor |publisher=BBC News |date=19 November 2002 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Newell, Ray (1997), ''Original Morris Minor'' (Bay View Books Ltd, Bideford, Devon, {{ISBN|1-870979-43-5}})\n*Wainwright, Martin (2008), ''Morris Minor \u2013 The Biography'' (Aurum Press, {{ISBN|978-1-84513-378-8}})\n\n==External links==\n*http://www.morrisdownunder.com/forum/index.php \u2013 Morris Minor community forum\n*http://MORRISMINOR.US \u2013 Morris Minor Registry of North America\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{dmoz|/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models/Morris/|Morris}}\n\n{{Automobiles made by BMC, BL and Rover Group companies, post-1945}}\n{{British Motor Holdings and British Leyland cars, 1966-1986}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[Category:Morris vehicles|Minor]]\n[[Category:Issigonis vehicles]]\n[[Category:1940s cars]]\n[[Category:Subcompact cars]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:Vans]]\n[[Category:Pickup trucks]]\n[[Category:1950s cars]]\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1948]]\n", "name_user": "TobyJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePre-production changes:syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Minor"}
