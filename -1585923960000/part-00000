The 18 May 1822 edition of the ''[[Hobart Town Gazette]]'' reported this escape and advertised a \u00a310 reward for his recapture. When caught, he was charged with absconding and forging an order, a serious crime. For this he received a second sentence of transportation, this time to the new secondary penal establishment at [[Macquarie Harbour Penal Station|Sarah Island]] in [[Macquarie Harbour]].\n\n==Escape and cannibalism==\n\n[[Image:Copy of the death sentence pronounced on Alexander Pearce - 1824.jpg|thumb|110px|left|Copy of the death sentence pronounced on Alexander Pearce]]\n\nOn 20 September 1822, Pearce along with seven other convicts of [[Macquarie Harbour Penal Station]]: Alexander Dalton, Thomas Bodenham, William Kennerly, Matthew Travers, Edward Brown, Robert Greenhill and John Mather escaped while working on the eastern side of the harbour. Greenhill, who had the axe, appointed himself leader, supported by his friend Travers, with whom he had been sent to Macquarie Harbour for stealing businessman [[Anthony Fenn Kemp]]'s [[schooner]] in an attempt to escape. About 15 days into the journey, the men were starving and [[Sortition|drew lots]] to see who would be killed for food.<ref name=\"theage\"/> Thomas Bodenham (or perhaps Alexander Dalton: see below) drew the short straw and Greenhill despatched him with an axe. At this point three of the company \u2013 Dalton, Kennerly and Brown \u2013 took fright and decamped. Kennerly and Brown reached Macquarie Harbour, but Dalton seemed to have died of [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]]. That left Greenhill, Travers, John Mather and Alexander Pearce. With Greenhill and Travers acting as a team, it would be Mather's or Pearce's turn next. Pearce seems to have sided with Greenhill and Travers at this point, and Mather was the next victim. It was then that Pearce had some luck: Travers was bitten on the foot by a snake. Greenhill insisted they carry him for five days, but when it became clear he would not recover, killed him.<ref name=\"sprod\">Sprod, Dan, ''Alexander Pearce of Macquarie Harbour'', Cat & Fiddle Press, Hobart 1977</ref>\n\nAfter that, it was a [[Cat and mouse|cat-and-mouse game]]. Greenhill had the axe, but they were both starving, and they had to sleep. In the end it was Pearce who prevailed. He grabbed the axe, killed Greenhill and dined on his body. He later raided an Aboriginal campsite and stole more food. When he saw sheep, he knew he had reached the settled districts. He was lucky again, as the shepherd who came upon him eating a lamb was an old friend. Pearce was inducted into a sheep-stealing ring, and was eventually picked up with William Davis and Ralph Churton, who were both hanged for bushranging and escaping from a military escort.\n\nIn total, Pearce had been on the run for 113 days, a little less than half of which was spent in the wilderness. Locked up in Hobart, Pearce made a confession to the Rev. [[Robert Knopwood]], the magistrate and chaplain. However, Knopwood did not believe the cannibalism story and was convinced the others were still living as [[bushranger]]s. He sent Pearce back to Macquarie Harbour.<ref name=\"theage\"/>\n\nThere are inconsistencies in Pearce's story. He made three confessions \u2013 the Knopwood confession; a confession to Lt. Cuthbertson, Commandant of Macquarie Harbour when he was in hospital after the second escape (in this version, Dalton is the first victim); and a confession to Father Phillip Connolly, the colony's Catholic priest, the night before his execution \u2013 and some of the details differed. What is incontrovertible is that eight men went into the bush at Macquarie Harbour, and only three came out; and of the four men alive when Dalton, Kennerly and Brown decamped, only one survived.\n\nWithin a year, Pearce escaped a second time, joined by a young convict named Thomas Cox. Pearce was captured within ten days and taken to the [[Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land]] in Hobart, where he was tried and convicted of murdering and cannibalising Thomas Cox. Observers noted Pearce did not look like a cannibal. He was only {{convert|1.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height, which was under average for that time, but had a strong wiry frame. He did not seem to be someone who was \"laden with the weight of human blood, and believed to have banqueted on human flesh\" as the ''Hobart Town Gazette'' wrote on 25 June 1824. His captors had found parts of Cox's body in Pearce's pockets, even though he still had food left, and his guilt was beyond doubt this time. Pearce confessed he had killed Cox because when they reached [[King River (Tasmania)|King's River]], he discovered that Cox could not swim. Pearce was the first felon to be executed by the new Supreme Court and the first confessed cannibal to pass through the Tasmanian court system.<ref name=\"sprod\"/>\n\nAlexander Pearce was hanged at the [[Hobart Town Gaol]] at 9am on 19 July 1824, after receiving the last rites from Father Connolly.<ref>The ''Hobart Town Gazette'', Friday 23 July 1824.</ref> It is reported that just before he was hanged, Pearce said, \"Man\u2019s flesh is delicious.

He sent Pearce back to Macquarie Harbour.<ref name=\"theage\"/>\n\nThere are inconsistencies in Pearce's story. He made three confessions \u2013 the Knopwood confession; a confession to Lt. Cuthbertson, Commandant of Macquarie Harbour when he was in hospital after the second escape (in this version, Dalton is the first victim); and a confession to Father Phillip Connolly, the colony's Catholic priest, the night before his execution \u2013 and some of the details differed. What is incontrovertible is that eight men went into the bush at Macquarie Harbour, and only three came out; and of the four men alive when Dalton, Kennerly and Brown decamped, only one survived.\n\nWithin a year, Pearce escaped a second time, joined by a young convict named Thomas Cox. Pearce was captured within ten days and taken to the [[Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land]] in Hobart, where he was tried and convicted of murdering and cannibalising Thomas Cox. Observers noted Pearce did not look like a cannibal. He was only {{convert|1.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height, which was under average for that time, but had a strong wiry frame. He did not seem to be someone who was \"laden with the weight of human blood, and believed to have banqueted on human flesh\" as the ''Hobart Town Gazette'' wrote on 25 June 1824. His captors had found parts of Cox's body in Pearce's pockets, even though he still had food left, and his guilt was beyond doubt this time. Pearce confessed he had killed Cox because when they reached [[King River (Tasmania)|King's River]], he discovered that Cox could not swim. Pearce was the first felon to be executed by the new Supreme Court and the first confessed cannibal to pass through the Tasmanian court system.<ref name=\"sprod\"/>\n\nAlexander Pearce was hanged at the [[Hobart Town Gaol]] at 9am on 19 July 1824, after receiving the last rites from Father Connolly.<ref>The ''Hobart Town Gazette'', Friday 23 July 1824.</ref> It is reported that just before he was hanged, Pearce said, \"Man\u2019s flesh is delicious. It tastes far better than fish or pork.\"<ref>[http://www.australianhistory.org/other-bushrangers.php Alexander Pierce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209021729/http://australianhistory.org/other-bushrangers.php |date=9 December 2010 }}.
