They came up with the idea to use an ISIL 25 fals coin and repurpose it as a medal to commemorate the fallen international fighters and volunteers. The initial medal construction involved having an actual ISIL 25 fals coin (as opposed to a replica) joined to a suspension bar. This was not able to be done because the disc and suspension bar in modern medal production are made as one meaning that medal manufacturers refused to make a separate suspension bar and then join it to the coin. Another issue was that not enough coins could be sourced in time to make the right number of medals.\n\n==== Project launch ====\nAfter consulting with other international veterans and related groups, the design was updated and a [[social media]] campaign on both [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] was launched. The official camping and project was launched on the 12th of November, 2019, the day after [[Remembrance Day]] and [[Veterans Day]] to help raise awareness of the project and of the international fighters and volunteers who were lost.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/The-Medal-for-the-Martyrs-102385111199884/|title=The Medal for the Martyrs - Facebook|last=|first=|date=12 November 2019|website=Facebook|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Funding ====\nOn 10 December 2019 a [[GoFundMe]] camping was started to raise funds for the project.

ISIL's name and motto from the obverse side were removed and replaced with the acronyms of the three main Kurdish forces and a motto. This was deliberately done to show the liberation of and destruction of ISIL's so-called \"[[caliphate]]\" as well as symbolising an attack on and eradication of their extremist and harmful ideology.\n\nThe medal was manufactured and assembled by Cash's Awards and Promotion Solutions located in [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], [[Australia]]. \n[[File:ISIS_25_Ful\u00fbs_coin_obverse.jpg|thumb|The obverse side of the ISIL 25 fals coin that the medal's obverse design was modelled from.]]\n\n==== Obverse ====\nThe obverse of the medal is a replica of the obverse side of an ISIL 25 fals coin. The medal reads at the top \"YPG SDF YPJ\" representing the three main forces that the volunteers were part of. This top line also replaces the original Arabic on the coin that read \"\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629\" (The Islamic State).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://english.religion.info/2018/12/23/the-return-of-the-gold-dinar-an-analysis-of-the-islamic-state-coin-production/|title=The Return of the Gold Dinar \u2013 An analysis of the Islamic State coin production|last=Moos|first=Olivier|date=23 December 2018|website=Religioscope|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|dead-url=}}</ref> The bottom line reads in [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] a saying and motto \"\u015eEH\u00ceD NAMIRIN\" (Martyrs Never Die).

In the centre is the coin's value (25 fals) \"\u0662\u0665 \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0627\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces154096.html|title=25 Falsan (thin variety)|last=|first=|date=|website=Numista|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|dead-url=}}</ref> within a segmented circle.

At the centre is the [[Islamic calligraphy]] of a [[Hadith]] and below is the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] year in Arabic text of the year that the medal was first issued in \"\u0662\u0660\u0662\u0660\" (2020); all surrounded by a pattern of interwoven curved lines. The Hadith reads in Arabic \"\u0623\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062f\u0642\u0629 \u062c\u0647\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0644\", which translates to in English as \"The best charity is the effort of the less wealthy\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOne of the reasons why this Hadith was placed on the coin by ISIL was to use Islamic teachings and beliefs to pursued the people under their control to donate these coins back towards their cause. The main reasons why it was decided to keep it on the medal was that it preaches the importance of charity which can be interpreted to preach how important it was for the recipients to volunteer themselves and ultimately pay the highest price for there acts of charity for the Kurdish, Syrian and Iraqi peoples.\n\n==== Ribbon ====\nThe ribbon in 32&nbsp;mm wide. At the centre is a 4mm red ([[Pantone#Pantone Color Matching System|Pantone]] 108) stripe flanked on either side by black (Pantone Black) stripes to symbolise the blood and loss of those that were killed. On either side of the central stripes are two 3mm light brown (Pantone 1205) stripes representing the sandy desert terrain of Syria. On the left is a 5mm yellow (Pantone Yellow) stripe flanked on both sides by 2mm green (Pantone 350) stripes, representing the flag of the YPG. On the right is a 5mm green (Pantone 350) stripe flanked on both sides by 2mm yellow (Pantone Yellow) stripes, representing the flag of the YPJ.\n\nYellow, red and green also makeup the tricolour [[Flag of North and East Syria]] which is used by the [[Movement for a Democratic Society]] (TEV-DEM), the political coalition that governs the [[Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria]] (NES) also known as [[Rojava]].\n\n==== Suspension bar ====\nOn the front facing side of the suspension bar is the boxed in text \"ROJAVA\", the Kurdish name of the semi-autonomous region of north-eastern Syria and the main region in which the recipients fought in. Connecting the suspension bar to the disc is a five-pointed star, the same that is used on many Kurdish flags such as those of the YPG and YPJ.

At the centre is the [[Islamic calligraphy]] of a [[Hadith]] and below is the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] year in Arabic text of the year that the medal was first issued in \"\u0662\u0660\u0662\u0660\" (2020); all surrounded by a pattern of interwoven curved lines.

The main reasons why it was decided to keep it on the medal was that it preaches the importance of charity which can be interpreted to preach how important it was for the recipients to volunteer themselves and ultimately pay the highest price for there acts of charity for the Kurdish, Syrian and Iraqi peoples.\n\n==== Ribbon ====\nThe ribbon in 32&nbsp;mm wide. At the centre is a 4mm red ([[Pantone#Pantone Color Matching System|Pantone]] 108) stripe flanked on either side by black (Pantone Black) stripes to symbolise the blood and loss of those that were killed. On either side of the central stripes are two 3mm light brown (Pantone 1205) stripes representing the sandy desert terrain of Syria. On the left is a 5mm yellow (Pantone Yellow) stripe flanked on both sides by 2mm green (Pantone 350) stripes, representing the flag of the YPG. On the right is a 5mm green (Pantone 350) stripe flanked on both sides by 2mm yellow (Pantone Yellow) stripes, representing the flag of the YPJ.\n\nYellow, red and green also makeup the tricolour [[Flag of North and East Syria]] which is used by the [[Movement for a Democratic Society]] (TEV-DEM), the political coalition that governs the [[Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria]] (NES) also known as [[Rojava]].\n\n==== Suspension bar ====\nOn the front facing side of the suspension bar is the boxed in text \"ROJAVA\", the Kurdish name of the semi-autonomous region of north-eastern Syria and the main region in which the recipients fought in. Connecting the suspension bar to the disc is a five-pointed star, the same that is used on many Kurdish flags such as those of the YPG and YPJ.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

Then, hospital admission is needed for intravenous antibiotics. For those who have completed treatment successfully, recurrence can also occur due to recrudescence or new melioidosis infection. With better therapies, the recrudescence rate has reduced from 10% to 5%. New infection is now more common than recrudescence.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Risk factors of recrudescence include severity of disease (patients with positive blood cultures or multifocal disease have a higher risk of relapse), choice of antibiotic for eradication therapy (doxycycline monotherapy and fluoroquinolone therapy are not as effective), poor compliance with eradication therapy and duration of eradication therapy less than 8 weeks.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Direk2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaowagul W, Suputtamongkol Y, Dance DA, Rajchanuvong A, Pattara-arechachai J, White NJ | year=1993 | title=Relapse in melioidosis: incidence and risk factors | journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume=168 | pages=1181&ndash;1185 | pmid=8228352 | issue=5 | doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1181}}</ref>\n\nUnderlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and cancer can worsen the long-term survival and disability of those who recover from infection.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

He also recollects experiencing and revolting against caste-based discrimination during this period. His initial schooling was in [[Thirukkuvalai]] and then in 1936 he shifted to a high school in [[Tiruvarur]]. As a teenager he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders including [[Panaganti Ramarayaningar|Panagal Arasar]], [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy (after whom Karunanidhi later named one of his sons). Karunanidhi joined the [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|anti-Hindi protests]] sparked by the provincial government's legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938 organised a group of boys to hold demonstrations travelling around Tiruvarur on a [[cycle rickshaw]]. The law was rescinded in 1939. The taste for activism however stuck and in the ensuing years, after a brief flirtation with [[Communism]], Karunanidhi started following the work and speeches of leaders of [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], [[Self-Respect Movement]] and [[Dravidar Kazhagam]]. He ignored schooling and dropped-out after failing three-times in the final year.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\nKarunanidhi started his first magazine, at age 15, called ''Manava Nesan'' (Friends of Students), which was hand-written and distributed. It was soon followed by the establishment of ''[[Murasoli]]'' (Drum Roll). He expanded into writing plays propagating Dravidian ideology, and at age 20 starting writing and performing in plays for the ''Dravid Nadigar Kazhagam'' (Dravidian Actor's Group) professionally.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nKarunanidhi married three times. His first marriage was to Padmavathi in September 1944, and they had a son [[M. K. Muthu]], who was briefly active in Tamil films and politics. Padmavathi died in 1948 soon after childbirth. In September of that year, Karunanidhi's marriage was [[arranged marriage|arranged]] with Dayalu Ammal, with whom he had three sons, [[M. K. Alagiri]], [[M. K. Stalin]] and M. K. Tamilarasu, and a daughter, M. K. Selvi. Alagiri and Stalin are active in state politics and competed to be their father's political successors, before Stalin prevailed. Tamilarasu is a businessman and film-producer and campaigner for his father and his party; Selvi campaigned for Karunanidhi elections too.

He founded an organisation for the local youth of his locality. He circulated a handwritten newspaper called ''Manavar Nesan'' to its members. Later he founded a student organisation called Tamil Nadu Tamil Manavar Mandram, which was the first student wing of the Dravidan Movement. Karunanidhi involved himself and the student community in social work with other members. Here he started a newspaper for its members, which grew into ''[[Murasoli]]'', the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] party's official newspaper.\n\nThe first major protest that aided Karunanidhi in gaining ground in Tamil politics was his involvement in the Kallakudi agitation in [[Kallakudi]]. Original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi and it was changed to Dalmiapuram after a cement mogul who built a cement plant there. DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi. In the protest Karunanidhi and his companions erased the name Dalmiapuram from the railway station and lay down on the tracks blocking the course of trains.

Ramachandran]], who floated his [[AIADMK]] party after being sacked by Karunanidhi from DMK a few years earlier, would come to power in Tamil Nadu.

He also recollects experiencing and revolting against caste-based discrimination during this period. His initial schooling was in [[Thirukkuvalai]] and then in 1936 he shifted to a high school in [[Tiruvarur]]. As a teenager he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders including [[Panaganti Ramarayaningar|Panagal Arasar]], [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy (after whom Karunanidhi later named one of his sons). Karunanidhi joined the [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|anti-Hindi protests]] sparked by the provincial government's legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938 organised a group of boys to hold demonstrations travelling around Tiruvarur on a [[cycle rickshaw]]. The law was rescinded in 1939. The taste for activism however stuck and in the ensuing years, after a brief flirtation with [[Communism]], Karunanidhi started following the work and speeches of leaders of [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], [[Self-Respect Movement]] and [[Dravidar Kazhagam]]. He ignored schooling and dropped-out after failing three-times in the final year.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\nKarunanidhi started his first magazine, at age 15, called ''Manava Nesan'' (Friends of Students), which was hand-written and distributed. It was soon followed by the establishment of ''[[Murasoli]]'' (Drum Roll). He expanded into writing plays propagating Dravidian ideology, and at age 20 starting writing and performing in plays for the ''Dravid Nadigar Kazhagam'' (Dravidian Actor's Group) professionally.<ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nKarunanidhi married three times. His first marriage was to Padmavathi in September 1944, and they had a son [[M. K. Muthu]], who was briefly active in Tamil films and politics. Padmavathi died in 1948 soon after childbirth. In September of that year, Karunanidhi's marriage was [[arranged marriage|arranged]] with Dayalu Ammal, with whom he had three sons, [[M. K. Alagiri]], [[M. K. Stalin]] and M. K. Tamilarasu, and a daughter, M. K. Selvi. Alagiri and Stalin are active in state politics and competed to be their father's political successors, before Stalin prevailed. Tamilarasu is a businessman and film-producer and campaigner for his father and his party; Selvi campaigned for Karunanidhi elections too. With his third wife, Rajathi Ammal, Karunanidhi had a daughter, [[Kanimozhi]], who is seen as his literary heir.<ref name=\"Family\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/aug/07/life-and-family-of-dmk-supremo-kalaignar-m-karunanidhi-1854601.html|title=Life and family of DMK supremo 'Kalaignar' M Karunanidhi|work=[[The New Indian Express]] |date = 7 August 2018}}</ref><ref name = \"Ravishankar20188\"/>\n\n==Screenwriting==\n[[File:Kalaimamani Award.jpg|left|thumb|Karunanidhi awarding Kalaimamani]]\n{{See also|Parasakthi (1952 film)|Tamil cinema and Dravidian politics}}\nKarunanidhi began his career as a screenwriter in the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] film industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caravanmagazine.in/Story.aspx?Storyid=817&StoryStyle=FullStory |title=The Last Lear \u2013 The Long Profile of Karunanidhi in The Caravan |publisher=[[The Caravan (magazine)|The Caravan India]] |accessdate=22 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326130359/http://caravanmagazine.in/Story.aspx?Storyid=817&StoryStyle=FullStory |archivedate=26 March 2012  }}</ref> His first movie as screenwriter was [[Rajakumari (1947 film)|Rajakumari]] produced by Coimbatore-based [[Jupiter Pictures]] directed by [[A.

S. Rajendran and P. Kannamba known for its crisp dialogues.\n\n===Writing and narration style===\nThrough his wit and oratorical skills he rapidly rose as a popular politician. As his movies and plays with strong social messages became popular, they suffered from increased censorship; two of his plays in the 1950s were banned.<ref name=Hardgrave/> He was famous for writing historical and social (reformist) stories which propagated the socialist and [[rationalism|rationalist]] ideals of the [[Dravidian movement]] to which he belonged. Alongside [[C. N. Annadurai]] he began using [[Tamil cinema]] to propagate his political ideals through his movies.\n\n===Filmography===\nAt the age of 20, Karunanidhi went to work for Jupiter Pictures as a scriptwriter. His first film, ''[[Rajakumaari]]'', gained him much popularity. It was here that his skills as a scriptwriter were honed, which extended to several films. He was active in screenwriting even during his later political career till 2011 when he last wrote for historic movie [[Ponnar Shankar (film)|Ponnar Shankar]].\n;Films\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*''[[Ponnar Shankar (film)|Ponnar Shankar]]'' (2011)\n*''[[Ilaignan]]'' (2011)\n*''[[Pen Singam]]'' (2010)\n*''[[Uliyin Osai]]'' (2008)\n*''[[Pasa Kiligal]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Kannamma (film)|Kannamma]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Mannin Maindhan]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Puthiya Parasakthi]]'' (1996)\n*''[[Madurai Meenakshi (film)|Madurai Meenakshi]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Kavalukku Kettikaran]]'' (1990)\n*''[[Paasa Mazhai]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Nyaya Tharasu]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Thendral Sudum]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Poruthadhu Pothum]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Ithu Engal Neethi]]'' (1988)\n*''[[Paasa Paravaigal (1988 film)|Paasa Paravaigal]]'' (1988)\n*''[[Paadatha Thenikkal]]'' (1988)\n*''[[Makkal Aanaiyittal]]'' (1988)\n*''[[Ore Raththam]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Veeran Veluthambi]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Neethikku Thandanai]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Sattam Oru Vilayaattu]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Puyal Paadum Paattu]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Palaivana Rojakkal]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Meendum Parasakthi]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Kaaval Kaithigal]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Thooku Medai]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Maadi Veettu Ezhai]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Kaalam Pathil Sollum]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Aadu Paambe]]'' (1979)\n*''[[Nenjukku Needhi]]'' (1979)\n*''[[Vandikaran Magan]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Pillaiyo Pillai (film)|Pillaiyo Pillai]]'' (1972)\n*''[[Thanga Thambi]]'' (1967)\n*''[[Valiba Virundhu]]'' (1967)\n*''[[Avan Pithana?]]'' (1966)\n*''[[Marakka Mudiyumaa]]'' (1966)\n*''[[Mani Magudam]]'' (1966)\n*''[[Poomalai]]'' (1965)\n*''[[Poompuhar (film)|Poompuhar]]'' (1964)\n*''[[Kaanchi Thalaivan]]'' (1963)\n*''[[Iruvar Ullam]]'' (1963)\n*''[[Thayilla Pillai (1961 film)|Thayilla Pillai]]'' (1961)\n*''[[Arasilangkumari]]'' (1961)\n*''[[Kuravanji]]'' (1960)\n*''[[Ellorum Innaattu Mannar]]'' (1960)\n*''[[Pudhumai Pithan (1957 film)|Pudhumai Pithan]]'' (1957)\n*''[[Pudhaiyal]]'' (1957)\n*''[[Raja Rani (1956 film)|Raja Rani]]'' (1956)\n*''[[Rangoon Radha]]'' (1956)\n*''[[Malaikkallan]]'' (1954)\n*''[[Manohara (film)|Manohara]]'' (1954)\n*''[[Ammaiyappan (film)|Ammaiyappan]]'' (1954)\n*''[[Thirumbi Paar (1953 film)|Thirumbi Paar]]'' (1953)\n*''[[Naam (1953 film)|Naam]]'' (1953)\n*''[[Panam (1952 film)|Panam]]'' (1952)\n*''[[Parasakthi (1952 film)|Parasakthi]]'' (1952)\n*''[[Manamagal]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Devaki (1951 film)|Devaki]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Manthiri Kumari]]'' (1950)\n*''[[Marudhanaattu Ilavarasi]]'' (1950)\n*''[[Abhimanyu (1948 film)|Abimanyu]]'' (1948)\n*''[[Rajakumaari]]'' (1947)\n{{div col end|4}}\nSivajiGanesan/Karunanidhi Movie List\n* ''[[Parasakthi (1952 film)|Parasakthi]]'' (1952)\n* ''[[Panam (1952 film)|Panam]]'' (1952)\n* ''[[Thirumbi Paar (1953 film)|Thirumbi Paar]]'' (1953)\n* ''[[Manohara (film)|Manohara]]'' (1954)\n* ''[[Raja Rani (1956 film)|Raja rani]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[Rangoon Radha]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[Pudhaiyal]]'' (1957)\n* ''[[Kuravanji]]'' (1960)\n* ''[[Iruvar Ullam]]'' (1963)\n* ''[[Maadi Veettu Ezhai]]'' (1981)\n\n;Television\n*''Romapuri Pandian'' (Kalaignar TV)\n*''Ramanujar'' (Kalaignar TV)\n\n==Literature==\n[[File:Sivaji Kalingar Sakthi .jpg|thumb|right|Karunanidhi (middle) with actor Sivaji Ganesan (left)]]\nKarunanidhi is known for his contributions to [[Tamil literature]]. His contributions cover a wide range: poems, letters, screenplays, novels, biographies, historical novels, stage-plays, dialogues and movie songs. He has written ''Kuraloviam'' for [[Thirukural]], Tholkaappiya Poonga, Poombukar, as well as many poems, essays and books. Apart from literature, Karunanidhi has also contributed to the [[Tamil language]] through art and architecture. Like the Kuraloviyam, in which Kalaignar wrote about Thirukkural, through the construction of [[Valluvar Kottam]] he gave an architectural presence to [[Thiruvalluvar]], in Chennai. At [[Kanyakumari]], Karunanidhi constructed a 133-foot-high statue of Thiruvalluvar in honour of the scholar.\n\n===Books===\nThe books written by Karunanidhi include ''Sanga Thamizh'', ''Thirukkural Urai'', ''[[Ponnar Sankar]]'', ''Romapuri Pandian'', ''[[Thenpandi Singam]]'', ''Vellikizhamai'', ''Nenjukku Needhi'', ''Iniyavai Irubathu'' and ''Kuraloviam''.  His books of prose and poetry number more than 100.\n\n===Stage plays===\nKarunanidhi's stage plays include: ''Manimagudam'', ''Ore Ratham'', ''Palaniappan'', ''Thooku Medai'', ''Kagithapoo'', ''Naane Arivali'', ''Vellikizhamai'', ''Udhayasooriyan'' and ''[[Silappathikaram]]''.\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Entry into politics===\n[[File:2016 Toyota Alphard 2.5 G van (AGH30R; 12-22-2018), South Tangerang.jpg|thumb|right|Karunanidhi's car Toyota Alphard]]\nKarunanidhi entered politics at the age of 14, inspired by a speech by Alagirisamy of the [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], and participated in [[Anti-Hindi agitations]]. He founded an organisation for the local youth of his locality. He circulated a handwritten newspaper called ''Manavar Nesan'' to its members. Later he founded a student organisation called Tamil Nadu Tamil Manavar Mandram, which was the first student wing of the Dravidan Movement. Karunanidhi involved himself and the student community in social work with other members. Here he started a newspaper for its members, which grew into ''[[Murasoli]]'', the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] party's official newspaper.\n\nThe first major protest that aided Karunanidhi in gaining ground in Tamil politics was his involvement in the Kallakudi agitation in [[Kallakudi]]. Original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi and it was changed to Dalmiapuram after a cement mogul who built a cement plant there. DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi. In the protest Karunanidhi and his companions erased the name Dalmiapuram from the railway station and lay down on the tracks blocking the course of trains. Two people died in the protest and Karunanidhi was arrested.<ref name=\"ramaswamy2210\">[[#Ramaswamy|Ramaswamy 1997]], p. 226</ref>\n\n===Rise to power===\nAt the age of 33, Karunanidhi entered the Tamil Nadu assembly by winning the [[Kulithalai]] seat in the 1957 election. He became the DMK treasurer in 1961 and deputy leader of opposition in the state assembly in the year 1962 and when the DMK came to power in 1967, he became the Minister for Public Works.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-45093900|title=M Karunanidhi: The radical wordsmith who shook up Indian politics|last=|first=|date=7 August 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=8 August 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n====Chief Minister====\nWhen Annadurai died in 1969, Karunanidhi became the [[Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu]] and the first leader of DMK, since the leader post was customarily left vacant for [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] during Annadurai time as Annadurai was party general secretary only. He has held various positions in the party and government during his long career in Tamil Nadu political arena.\n\n====70's and Emergency====\nDuring the [[Emergency]], the DMK was the only ruling party across India that opposed the Emergency,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} for which his government was summarily dismissed by [[Indira Gandhi]]'s government and many of his party leaders were arrested and jailed till the Emergency was lifted. Later, the D.M.K teamed up with the [[Janata Party]] post-Emergency, but suffered defeat at the assembly elections under accusations of corruption .\n\nHis one time friend [[M. G. Ramachandran]], who floated his [[AIADMK]] party after being sacked by Karunanidhi from DMK a few years earlier, would come to power in Tamil Nadu. The DMK then suffered multiple electoral defeats against his primary opponent M.G.Ramachandran's AIADMK, until the latter's death in 1987.\n[[File:The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Dr. Kalaignar M.
