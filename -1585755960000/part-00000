Regional municipalities were formed in highly populated areas where it was considered more efficient to provide certain services, such as water, emergency services, and waste management over an area encompassing more than one local municipality. For this reason, regions may be involved in providing services to residents and businesses.\n\nRegional municipalities, where they include smaller municipalities within their boundaries, are sometimes referred to as \"upper-tier\" municipalities. Regional municipalities generally have more servicing responsibilities than counties. Typical services include maintenance and construction of arterial roads (including in urban areas, where counties do not), transit, policing, sewer and water systems, waste disposal, region-wide [[land-use planning]] and development and health and social services. \n\nRegions are typically more urbanized than counties.
