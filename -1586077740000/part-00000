Since the middle ages the fortress was the namesake and centre of the main fief and later main county of [[Akershus]], which was originally one of Norway's four main regions and which included most of [[Eastern Norway]]. The fortress itself was located within Akershus main county until 1919, and also within the smaller Akershus sub county until 1842.\n\nThe castle has also been used as a military base, a prison and is currently the temporary [[Office of the Prime Minister (Norway)|office]] of the [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime minister of Norway]].<ref>https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/smk/kontakt/id883/</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nIt is not known exactly when the construction of the [[List of Norwegian Fortresses|castle]] started but it is believed that it took place around the late 1290s, by [[Haakon V of Norway|King Haakon&nbsp;V]], replacing [[T\u00f8nsberg Fortress|T\u00f8nsberg]] as one of the two most important Norwegian castles of the period (the other being [[B\u00e5hus Fortress|B\u00e5hus]]). It was constructed in response to the Norwegian nobleman, Earl [[Alv Erlingsson]] of [[Sarpsborg]]\u2019s earlier attack on Oslo that occurred in 1287. In the aftermath of the attack, it became clear that the city\u2019s existing defences weren\u2019t effective and therefore, a stronger defensive centre was needed.\n\nThe castle is mentioned in written sources for the first time in 1300 in a letter from King Haakon to a church in Oslo. However, the letter does not mention how far the construction of the castle had progressed by then.\n\nThe fortress has successfully survived all sieges, primarily by [[Sweden|Swedish]] forces, including those by forces led by [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] in 1716.\n\n==Military use==\n=== The Middle Ages ===\nThe fortress was first used in battle in 1308, when it was besieged by the Swedish duke [[Eric, Duke of S\u00f6dermanland|Eric]] of [[S\u00f6dermanland]], whose brother won the Swedish throne in 1309. The siege was eventually broken by a local Norwegian army in a battle. (This battle forms a major part of the plot of [[Sigrid Undset]]'s historical novel ''In the Wilderness'', the third volume of her tetralogy ''[[The Master of Hestviken]]''.)\n\n=== Renaissance and Denmark-Norway ===\nIn 1449-1450 the castle was besieged again, this time by the Swedish king [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson Bonde]], but he had to lift the siege after a while. The castle was not besieged again until 1502 when Scottish soldiers in the service of the Danish king besieged the castle in order to regain it from the hands of the Norwegian nobleman [[Knut Alvsson]].\n\nAkershus was besieged yet again in 1523, this time by Swedish soldiers but Oslo\u2019s inhabitants, at the command of Hans Mule, burned down their houses in an attempt to drive them out and the Swedes retreated after a short period.<ref>https://nbl.snl.no/Hans_Mule</ref> King Christian II besieged the castle from 1531 to 1532 but the siege was lifted by forces from Denmark and L\u00fcbeck. After this siege the castle was improved and strengthened.\n\nIn 1567, during the [[Northern Seven Years' War]], the castle was besieged once more by Swedish forces, but the Danish king's lord lieutenant, [[Christen Munk]], responded by [[Scorched earth|burning down the city]] in order to deprive the attackers themselves of the means of receiving supplies, and eventually the Swedes retreated.\n\nThe immediate proximity of the sea was a key feature, for [[navy|naval power]] was a vital [[military]] [[force]] as the majority of Norwegian commerce in that period was by sea. The fortress was strategically important for the capital, and therefore, [[Norway]] as well. Whoever controlled Akershus fortress ruled Norway.\n\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:German surrender of Akershus Fortress.jpg|thumb|left|The German garnison's commander Major {{Interlanguage link|Josef Nichterlein|no}} and his aide Captain Johannes Hamel handing the fortress over to the Norwegian resistance movement's [[Terje Rollem]] (May 11, 1945)]]\n\nThe fortress has never successfully been [[besiege]]d by a foreign enemy. However it surrendered without combat to [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940 when the Norwegian government evacuated the capital in the face of the unprovoked German assault on [[Denmark]] and Norway (see [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]]).\n\nDuring World War II, people were executed here by the German occupiers, including members of the [[Pelle group]]. The fortress was liberated on 11 May 1945, when it was handed over to [[Terje Rollem]] on behalf of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]]. After the war, eight Norwegian traitors who had been tried for war crimes and sentenced to death were also executed at the fortress. Among those executed were [[Vidkun Quisling]] and [[Siegfried Fehmer]].\n{{clearleft}}\n\n== Royal residence ==\n[[File:Akershus slott 20090503-08.jpg|thumb|The hall of [[King Christian IV]]]]\n\n=== During the Middle Ages ===\n\nAfter construction of the castle was finished around 1300, [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]] gradually started to use the castle as a residential palace, favoring the keep over the [[Oslo Kongsg\u00e5rd estate|Oslo Kongsgard Estate]] despite the fact that the castle likely was unsuited as a residence.<ref>{{Citation|title=NRK TV - Se Akershus slott og festning gjennom 700 \u00e5r|url=https://tv.nrk.no/serie/akershus-slott-og-festning-gjennom-700-aar/FOLA00009077/25-12-1979#t=3m4s|language=no|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref> The castle becoming a royal residence also played a significant role in the process where the capital for [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)|Norway]] was moved from [[Bergen]] to [[Oslo]].

Since the middle ages the fortress was the namesake and centre of the main fief and later main county of [[Akershus]], which was originally one of Norway's four main regions and which included most of [[Eastern Norway]]. The fortress itself was located within Akershus main county until 1919, and also within the smaller Akershus sub county until 1842.\n\nThe castle has also been used as a military base, a prison and is currently the temporary [[Office of the Prime Minister (Norway)|office]] of the [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime minister of Norway]].<ref>https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/smk/kontakt/id883/</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nIt is not known exactly when the construction of the [[List of Norwegian Fortresses|castle]] started but it is believed that it took place around the late 1290s, by [[Haakon V of Norway|King Haakon&nbsp;V]], replacing [[T\u00f8nsberg Fortress|T\u00f8nsberg]] as one of the two most important Norwegian castles of the period (the other being [[B\u00e5hus Fortress|B\u00e5hus]]). It was constructed in response to the Norwegian nobleman, Earl [[Alv Erlingsson]] of [[Sarpsborg]]\u2019s earlier attack on Oslo that occurred in 1287. In the aftermath of the attack, it became clear that the city\u2019s existing defences weren\u2019t effective and therefore, a stronger defensive centre was needed.\n\nThe castle is mentioned in written sources for the first time in 1300 in a letter from King Haakon to a church in Oslo. However, the letter does not mention how far the construction of the castle had progressed by then.\n\nThe fortress has successfully survived all sieges, primarily by [[Sweden|Swedish]] forces, including those by forces led by [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] in 1716.\n\n==Military use==\n=== The Middle Ages ===\nThe fortress was first used in battle in 1308, when it was besieged by the Swedish duke [[Eric, Duke of S\u00f6dermanland|Eric]] of [[S\u00f6dermanland]], whose brother won the Swedish throne in 1309. The siege was eventually broken by a local Norwegian army in a battle. (This battle forms a major part of the plot of [[Sigrid Undset]]'s historical novel ''In the Wilderness'', the third volume of her tetralogy ''[[The Master of Hestviken]]''.)\n\n=== Renaissance and Denmark-Norway ===\nIn 1449-1450 the castle was besieged again, this time by the Swedish king [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson Bonde]], but he had to lift the siege after a while. The castle was not besieged again until 1502 when Scottish soldiers in the service of the Danish king besieged the castle in order to regain it from the hands of the Norwegian nobleman [[Knut Alvsson]].\n\nAkershus was besieged yet again in 1523, this time by Swedish soldiers but Oslo\u2019s inhabitants, at the command of Hans Mule, burned down their houses in an attempt to drive them out and the Swedes retreated after a short period.<ref>https://nbl.snl.no/Hans_Mule</ref> King Christian II besieged the castle from 1531 to 1532 but the siege was lifted by forces from Denmark and L\u00fcbeck. After this siege the castle was improved and strengthened.\n\nIn 1567, during the [[Northern Seven Years' War]], the castle was besieged once more by Swedish forces, but the Danish king's lord lieutenant, [[Christen Munk]], responded by [[Scorched earth|burning down the city]] in order to deprive the attackers themselves of the means of receiving supplies, and eventually the Swedes retreated.\n\nThe immediate proximity of the sea was a key feature, for [[navy|naval power]] was a vital [[military]] [[force]] as the majority of Norwegian commerce in that period was by sea. The fortress was strategically important for the capital, and therefore, [[Norway]] as well. Whoever controlled Akershus fortress ruled Norway.\n\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:German surrender of Akershus Fortress.jpg|thumb|left|The German garnison's commander Major {{Interlanguage link|Josef Nichterlein|no}} and his aide Captain Johannes Hamel handing the fortress over to the Norwegian resistance movement's [[Terje Rollem]] (May 11, 1945)]]\n\nThe fortress has never successfully been [[besiege]]d by a foreign enemy. However it surrendered without combat to [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940 when the Norwegian government evacuated the capital in the face of the unprovoked German assault on [[Denmark]] and Norway (see [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]]).\n\nDuring World War II, people were executed here by the German occupiers, including members of the [[Pelle group]]. The fortress was liberated on 11 May 1945, when it was handed over to [[Terje Rollem]] on behalf of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]]. After the war, eight Norwegian traitors who had been tried for war crimes and sentenced to death were also executed at the fortress. Among those executed were [[Vidkun Quisling]] and [[Siegfried Fehmer]].\n{{clearleft}}\n\n== Royal residence ==\n[[File:Akershus slott 20090503-08.jpg|thumb|The hall of [[King Christian IV]]]]\n\n=== During the Middle Ages ===\n\nAfter construction of the castle was finished around 1300, [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]] gradually started to use the castle as a residential palace, favoring the keep over the [[Oslo Kongsg\u00e5rd estate|Oslo Kongsgard Estate]] despite the fact that the castle likely was unsuited as a residence.<ref>{{Citation|title=NRK TV - Se Akershus slott og festning gjennom 700 \u00e5r|url=https://tv.nrk.no/serie/akershus-slott-og-festning-gjennom-700-aar/FOLA00009077/25-12-1979#t=3m4s|language=no|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref> The castle becoming a royal residence also played a significant role in the process where the capital for [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)|Norway]] was moved from [[Bergen]] to [[Oslo]].

(Fenaroli Partimento No. 1, Book 1, Gj1301)]]\n[[File:Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418.jpg|thumb|right|500px| A partimenti fugue for more advanced students. As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825 ca|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}}\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825 ca|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

He then retired again from the following race in [[2019 Russian Grand Prix|Russia]] after suffering a wheel nut issue.

Hear'Say enjoyed brief success, achieving two UK number one singles and a UK number one album, but Marsh left the band in 2002 to pursue a solo career. She released an album titled ''[[Standing Tall (Kym Marsh album)|Standing Tall]]'' in 2003, which peaked at number nine in the UK and spawned two UK top ten singles.\n\nFrom April 2006 to December 2019, she portrayed [[Michelle mcfish]] on the [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]''. She was named Best Newcomer at the 2007 [[The British Soap Awards|British Soap Awards]] and the [[13th National Television Awards|2007 National Television Awards]], and received the award for Best Female Dramatic Performance at the [[The British Soap Awards#2017 winners|2017 British Soap Awards]]. In 2010, she finished fourth when she competed on ''[[Popstar to Operastar]]'', a reality show featuring well-known pop stars being trained to sing opera.\n\n== Early life ==\nMarsh was born on 13 June 1976 in [[Whiston, Merseyside]] to Pauline,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kym-marsh-mn0000599288/biography | title=Kym Marsh &#124; Biography & History}}</ref> and David Marsh. She attended the Elliot Clarke Stage School in Liverpool for two years, leaving when she was 15.\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Early singing career and Hear'Say===\n{{Main|Hear'Say}}\nAt age 16, Marsh appeared in the music video of [[Dusty Springfield]]'s \"[[In Private]]\".\n\nMarsh provided session vocals for artists including Matt Darey, the group Freaky Realistic and the duo Hemstock & Jennings. She sang in Norwegian on the latter's track \"Arctic\", which caught the attention of [[Paul van Dyk]], and was remixed and re-recorded with additional vocals from [[Jan Johnston]]. The track, renamed \"[[Nothing But You]]\", was released in the UK via [[Positiva]] and reached number 14 in the UK charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trance.nu/v4/interviews/hemstock--jennings |title=The home of music |publisher=Trance.nu |date= |accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_D.HTM |title=Chart Log UK: Asher D \u2013 Dyverse |publisher=Zobbel.de |date= |accessdate=31 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019075638/http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_D.HTM |archivedate=19 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn late 2000, Marsh auditioned for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] talent show ''[[Popstars (UK TV series)|Popstars]]''. She was one of the five singers chosen for the newly formed band [[Hear'Say]], along with [[Danny Foster (musician)|Danny Foster]], [[Myleene Klass]], [[Suzanne Shaw]] and [[Noel Sullivan]]. In March 2001, Hear'Say released their first single \"[[Pure and Simple (song)|Pure and Simple]]\", a cover of a track by [[Girl Thing]]. She was hailed by her girl bandmates as the funniest out of the bunch\u2019. The song went straight to number 1 on the UK Singles Chart in March 2001, selling just under 550,000 copies. The group then released their second single, \"[[The Way to Your Love]],\" in June 2001. The song became their second consecutive number 1 single. Shortly afterwards the group toured the UK.\n\nIn January 2002, Marsh announced that she was leaving Hear'Say. Auditions were held to find a replacement for her, but the group split up in October 2002.\n\n===''Standing Tall''===\nAfter a while out of the spotlight Marsh signed a solo record deal with [[Island Records]]. Her first single, \"[[Cry (Kym Marsh song)|Cry]]\", went to number 2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and her second single, \"[[Come on Over (Kym Marsh song)|Come on Over]],\" made it to number 10.<ref name=\"uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/433/kym-marsh/|title=Kym Marsh|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2003, Marsh released her debut solo album, ''[[Standing Tall (Kym Marsh album)|Standing Tall]]'', which peaked at number 9 in the UK.<ref name=\"uk\"/> It contained three solo singles and twelve other tracks. However, her make-or-break third single, \"Sentimental\", stalled at number 35,<ref name=\"uk\"/> and that resulted in her being dropped by her record label.\n\nMarsh has said that she would like to return to music one day, but \"Right now I'm focusing on ''Corrie'' and I am putting all my effort into it.\"\n\n===Eurovision===\nIn early 2006,  Marsh entered ''[[Making Your Mind Up (TV series)|Making Your Mind Up]]'', a show intended to pick a singer and a song for the UK entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. With a song, called \"Whisper to Me\", Marsh came fourth in the contest, which was won by [[Daz Sampson]].\n\n==Television career==\n[[File:Kym Marsh, Manchester Arndale (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Marsh opening a clothes shop at the [[Arndale Centre]] in Manchester in 2012]]\nMarsh made her television acting debut in 2005, in an episode of the [[BBC One]] soap opera ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'', playing a character called Ruth Parry.

[[reality television]] series ''[[Popstars (UK TV series)|Popstars]]''. Hear'Say enjoyed brief success, achieving two UK number one singles and a UK number one album, but Marsh left the band in 2002 to pursue a solo career. She released an album titled ''[[Standing Tall (Kym Marsh album)|Standing Tall]]'' in 2003, which peaked at number nine in the UK and spawned two UK top ten singles.\n\nFrom April 2006 to December 2019, she portrayed [[Michelle Connor]] on the [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]''. She was named Best Newcomer at the 2007 [[The British Soap Awards|British Soap Awards]] and the [[13th National Television Awards|2007 National Television Awards]], and received the award for Best Female Dramatic Performance at the [[The British Soap Awards#2017 winners|2017 British Soap Awards]]. In 2010, she finished fourth when she competed on ''[[Popstar to Operastar]]'', a reality show featuring well-known pop stars being trained to sing opera.\n\n== Early life ==\nMarsh was born on 13 June 1976 in [[Whiston, Merseyside]] to Pauline,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kym-marsh-mn0000599288/biography | title=Kym Marsh &#124; Biography & History}}</ref> and David Marsh. She attended the Elliot Clarke Stage School in Liverpool for two years, leaving when she was 15.\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Early singing career and Hear'Say===\n{{Main|Hear'Say}}\nAt age 16, Marsh appeared in the music video of [[Dusty Springfield]]'s \"[[In Private]]\".\n\nMarsh provided session vocals for artists including Matt Darey, the group Freaky Realistic and the duo Hemstock & Jennings. She sang in Norwegian on the latter's track \"Arctic\", which caught the attention of [[Paul van Dyk]], and was remixed and re-recorded with additional vocals from [[Jan Johnston]]. The track, renamed \"[[Nothing But You]]\", was released in the UK via [[Positiva]] and reached number 14 in the UK charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trance.nu/v4/interviews/hemstock--jennings |title=The home of music |publisher=Trance.nu |date= |accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_D.HTM |title=Chart Log UK: Asher D \u2013 Dyverse |publisher=Zobbel.de |date= |accessdate=31 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019075638/http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_D.HTM |archivedate=19 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn late 2000, Marsh auditioned for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] talent show ''[[Popstars (UK TV series)|Popstars]]''. She was one of the five singers chosen for the newly formed band [[Hear'Say]], along with [[Danny Foster (musician)|Danny Foster]], [[Myleene Klass]], [[Suzanne Shaw]] and [[Noel Sullivan]]. In March 2001, Hear'Say released their first single \"[[Pure and Simple (song)|Pure and Simple]]\", a cover of a track by [[Girl Thing]]. She was hailed by her girl bandmates as the funniest out of the bunch\u2019. The song went straight to number 1 on the UK Singles Chart in March 2001, selling just under 550,000 copies. The group then released their second single, \"[[The Way to Your Love]],\" in June 2001. The song became their second consecutive number 1 single. Shortly afterwards the group toured the UK.\n\nIn January 2002, Marsh announced that she was leaving Hear'Say. Auditions were held to find a replacement for her, but the group split up in October 2002.\n\n===''Standing Tall''===\nAfter a while out of the spotlight Marsh signed a solo record deal with [[Island Records]]. Her first single, \"[[Cry (Kym Marsh song)|Cry]]\", went to number 2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and her second single, \"[[Come on Over (Kym Marsh song)|Come on Over]],\" made it to number 10.<ref name=\"uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/433/kym-marsh/|title=Kym Marsh|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2003, Marsh released her debut solo album, ''[[Standing Tall (Kym Marsh album)|Standing Tall]]'', which peaked at number 9 in the UK.<ref name=\"uk\"/> It contained three solo singles and twelve other tracks. However, her make-or-break third single, \"Sentimental\", stalled at number 35,<ref name=\"uk\"/> and that resulted in her being dropped by her record label.\n\nMarsh has said that she would like to return to music one day, but \"Right now I'm focusing on ''Corrie'' and I am putting all my effort into it.\"\n\n===Eurovision===\nIn early 2006,  Marsh entered ''[[Making Your Mind Up (TV series)|Making Your Mind Up]]'', a show intended to pick a singer and a song for the UK entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. With a song, called \"Whisper to Me\", Marsh came fourth in the contest, which was won by [[Daz Sampson]].\n\n==Television career==\n[[File:Kym Marsh, Manchester Arndale (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Marsh opening a clothes shop at the [[Arndale Centre]] in Manchester in 2012]]\nMarsh made her television acting debut in 2005, in an episode of the [[BBC One]] soap opera ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'', playing a character called Ruth Parry.
