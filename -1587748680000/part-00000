As well, scatting usually incorporates musical [[Musical form|structure]]. All of [[Ella Fitzgerald]]'s scat performances of \"[[How High the Moon]],\" for instance, use the same [[tempo]], begin with a chorus of a straight reading of the lyric, move to a \"specialty chorus\" introducing the scat chorus, and then the scat itself.<ref name=f145>{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=145}}</ref> [[Will Friedwald]] has compared Ella Fitzgerald to [[Chuck Jones]] directing his [[Roadrunner cartoon]]\u2014each uses predetermined formulas in innovative ways.<ref name=f145/>\n\nThe deliberate choice of scat syllables is also a key element in vocal jazz improvisation. Syllable choice influences the pitch [[articulation (music)|articulation]], coloration, and [[Sonorant|resonance]] of the performance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|p=125}}</ref> Syllable choice also differentiated jazz singers' personal styles: [[Betty Carter]] was inclined to use sounds like \"louie-ooie-la-la-la\" (soft-tongued sounds or liquids) while Sarah Vaughan would prefer \"shoo-doo-shoo-bee-ooo-bee\" ([[fricatives]], [[plosives]], and [[open vowels]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|pp=125\u2013126}}</ref> The choice of scat syllables can also be used to reflect the sounds of different instruments. The comparison of the scatting styles of Ella Fitzgerald and [[Sarah Vaughan]] reveals that Fitzgerald's improvisation mimics{{efn|name=Fitzgerald|In her 1949 performance of \"Flyin' Home,\" Fitzgerald alternates the bilabial \"b\" and \"p\" plosives with the alveolar plosive \"d\".<ref name=s65>{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=65}}</ref> The \"b\" and \"p\" sounds are formed similarly to the sounds of jazz wind instruments, which sound by the release of built-up mouth air pressure onto the reed, while the \"d\" sound is similar to the tonguing on jazz brass instruments.<ref name=s65/> William Stewart, a Seattle researcher, has proposed that this alternation simulates the exchange of riffs between the wind and brass sections that is common in big bands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=66}}</ref>}} the sounds of [[swing-era]] [[big band]]s with which she performed, while Vaughan's mimics{{efn|name=Vaughan|Sarah Vaughan tends to use the fricative consonant \"sh\" along with the low, back of the mouth \"ah\" vowel. The \"sh\" closely resembles the sound of brushes, common in the bop era, on drum heads; the \"ah\" vowel resonates similarly to the bass drum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=69}}</ref>}} that of her accompanying [[Bebop|bop]]-era small combos.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=74}}.</ref> \n\n=== Humor and quotation ===\nHumor is another important element of scat singing. Bandleader [[Cab Calloway]] exemplified the use of humorous scatting.<ref>{{harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=129}}</ref> Other examples of humorous scatting include [[Slim Gaillard]], [[Leo Watson]], and Bam Brown's 1945 song \"Avocado Seed Soup Symphony,\" in which the singers scat variations on the word \"avocado\" for much of the recording.<ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=627}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to such nonsensical uses of language, humor is communicated in scat singing through the use of [[musical quotation]]. Leo Watson, who performed before the canon of American popular music, frequently drew on nursery rhymes in his scatting. This is called using a compression.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=140}}</ref> Similarly, Ella Fitzgerald's scatting, for example, drew extensively on popular music. In her 1960 recording of \"[[How High the Moon]]\" live in Berlin, she quotes over a dozen songs, including \"[[The Peanut Vendor]],\" \"[[Heat Wave (Irving Berlin song)|Heat Wave]],\" \"[[A-Tisket, A-Tasket]],\" and \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]].\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=623}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Jolsonscat.ogg|title=\"That Haunting Melody\" (1911) excerpt|description=[[Al Jolson]]'s scatting during his 1911 recording of \"That Haunting Melody\" has been cited as one of the earliest examples of scat singing|pos=right|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nAlthough [[Louis Armstrong]]'s 1926 recording of \"[[Heebie Jeebies (composition)|Heebie Jeebies]]\" is often cited as the first song to employ scatting,<ref name=\"Crowther Pinfold 1997\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=618}}</ref> there are many earlier examples.<ref name=\"Edwards 2002 618-619\"/> One early master of ragtime scat singing was [[Gene Greene]] who recorded scat choruses in his song \"King of the Bungaloos\" and several others between 1911 and 1917.<ref name=\"Edwards 2002 619\">{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=619}}</ref> Entertainer [[Al Jolson]] scatted through a few bars in the middle of his 1911 recording of \"That Haunting Mei farted like no ones business        \nlody.\"<ref name=\"Gioia\">{{Harvnb|Gioia|2011|p=59}}</ref> Gene Green's 1917 \"From Here to Shanghai,\" which featured faux-Chinese scatting,<ref name=\"Edwards 2002 619\"/> and [[Gene Rodemich]]'s 1924 \"Scissor Grinder Joe\" and \"Some of These Days\" also pre-date Armstrong.<ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=619}}</ref> [[Cliff Edwards|Cliff \"Ukulele Ike\" Edwards]] scatted an interlude on his 1923 \"Old Fashioned Love\" in lieu of using an instrumental soloist.<ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=620}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=16}}</ref> One of the early female singers to use scat was [[Aileen Stanley]], who included it at the end of a duet with [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]] in their hit 1924 recording of \"[[It Had To Be You (song)|It Had To Be You]]\" (Victor 19373).\n\nJazz pianist [[Jelly Roll Morton]] credited Joe Sims of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], as the creator of scat around the turn of the 20th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholson|1993|p=89}}</ref> In a conversation between [[Alan Lomax]] and Jelly Roll Morton, Morton recounted the history of scat:<ref name=\"Hill 2014\">{{Harvnb|Hill|2014}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n'''Lomax''': \"Well, what about some more scat songs, that you used to sing way back then?\"\n<br />\n'''Morton''': \"Oh, I'll sing you some scat songs.

During the [[bop era]] of the 1940s, more highly developed vocal improvisation surged in popularity.<ref name=\"grove\"/> [[Annie Ross]], a bop singer, expressed a common sentiment among vocalists at the time: \"The [scat] music was so exciting, everyone wanted to do it.\"<ref name=\"cp130\"/> And many did: [[Eddie Jefferson]], [[Betty Carter]], [[Anita O'Day]], [[Joe Carroll (singer)|Joe Carroll]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Carmen McRae]], [[Jon Hendricks]], [[Babs Gonzales]], and [[Dizzy Gillespie]] were all singers in the idiom.<ref name=\"grove\"/> \n\nFree jazz and the influence of world musicians on the medium pushed jazz singing nearer to avant-garde art music.<ref name=\"grove\"/> In the 1960s [[Ward Swingle]] was the product of an unusually liberal musical education. He took the scat singing idea and applied it to the works of Bach, creating [[The Swingle Singers]]. Scat singing was also used by [[Louis Prima]] and others in the song \"[[I Wan'na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)|I Wan'na Be Like You]]\" in Disney's ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967).\n\nThe bop revival of the 1970s renewed interest in bop scat singing, and young scat singers viewed themselves as a continuation of the classic bop tradition. The medium continues to evolve, and vocal improvisation now often develops independently of changes in instrumental jazz.<ref name=\"grove\"/>\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, jazz artist John Paul Larkin (better known as [[Scatman John]]) renewed interest in the genre briefly when he began fusing jazz singing with [[pop music]] and [[electronica]], scoring a world-wide hit with the song \"[[Scatman (Ski Ba Bop Ba Dop Bop)]]\" in 1994. Vocal improviser [[Bobby McFerrin]]'s performances have shown that \"wordless singing has traveled far from the concepts demonstrated by Louis Armstrong, Gladys Bentley, Cab Calloway, Anita O'Day, and Leo Watson.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=135}}</ref>\n\n=== Vocal bass ===\nVocal bass is a form of scat singing that is intended to vocally simulate instrumental [[basslines]] that are typically performed by bass players. A technique most commonly used by bass singers in a cappella groups is to simulate an instrumental rhythm section, often alongside a [[Mouth drumming|vocal percussionist]] or [[beatboxer]]. Some notable vocal bass artists are [[Home Free (group)|Tim Foust]], [[Home Free (group)|Adam Chance]], [[Bobby McFerrin]], [[Al Jarreau]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[take 6|Alvin Chea]], [[DCappella|Joe Santoni]], [[Avi Kaplan]], [[Pentatonix|Scott Hoying]] and [[Pentatonix|Matt Sallee]].\n\n=== Use in hip hop  ===\nMany [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artists and [[rapper]]s use scat singing to come up with the rhythms of their raps.<ref name=\"Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC\">{{Harvnb|Edwards|2009|p=114}}</ref> [[Tajai]] of the group [[Souls of Mischief]] states the following in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'': \"Sometimes my rhythms come from scatting. I usually make a scat kind of skeleton and then fill in the words.

Writer and critic [[Leonard Feather]] offers an extreme view; he once said that \"scat singing\u2014with only a couple exceptions\u2014should be banned.\"<ref name=\"cp130\"/> He also wrote the lyrics to the jazz song \"[[Whisper Not (song)|Whisper Not]],\" which Ella Fitzgerald then recorded on her 1966 Verve release of the same name.

As well, scatting usually incorporates musical [[Musical form|structure]]. All of [[Ella Fitzgerald]]'s scat performances of \"[[How High the Moon]],\" for instance, use the same [[tempo]], begin with a chorus of a straight reading of the lyric, move to a \"specialty chorus\" introducing the scat chorus, and then the scat itself.<ref name=f145>{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=145}}</ref> [[Will Friedwald]] has compared Ella Fitzgerald to [[Chuck Jones]] directing his [[Roadrunner cartoon]]\u2014each uses predetermined formulas in innovative ways.<ref name=f145/>\n\nThe deliberate choice of scat syllables is also a key element in vocal jazz improvisation. Syllable choice influences the pitch [[articulation (music)|articulation]], coloration, and [[Sonorant|resonance]] of the performance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|p=125}}</ref> Syllable choice also differentiated jazz singers' personal styles: [[Betty Carter]] was inclined to use sounds like \"louie-ooie-la-la-la\" (soft-tongued sounds or liquids) while Sarah Vaughan would prefer \"shoo-doo-shoo-bee-ooo-bee\" ([[fricatives]], [[plosives]], and [[open vowels]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|pp=125\u2013126}}</ref> The choice of scat syllables can also be used to reflect the sounds of different instruments. The comparison of the scatting styles of Ella Fitzgerald and [[Sarah Vaughan]] reveals that Fitzgerald's improvisation mimics{{efn|name=Fitzgerald|In her 1949 performance of \"Flyin' Home,\" Fitzgerald alternates the bilabial \"b\" and \"p\" plosives with the alveolar plosive \"d\".<ref name=s65>{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=65}}</ref> The \"b\" and \"p\" sounds are formed similarly to the sounds of jazz wind instruments, which sound by the release of built-up mouth air pressure onto the reed, while the \"d\" sound is similar to the tonguing on jazz brass instruments.<ref name=s65/> William Stewart, a Seattle researcher, has proposed that this alternation simulates the exchange of riffs between the wind and brass sections that is common in big bands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=66}}</ref>}} the sounds of [[swing-era]] [[big band]]s with which she performed, while Vaughan's mimics{{efn|name=Vaughan|Sarah Vaughan tends to use the fricative consonant \"sh\" along with the low, back of the mouth \"ah\" vowel. The \"sh\" closely resembles the sound of brushes, common in the bop era, on drum heads; the \"ah\" vowel resonates similarly to the bass drum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=69}}</ref>}} that of her accompanying [[Bebop|bop]]-era small combos.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=74}}.</ref> \n\n=== Humor and quotation ===\nHumor is another important element of scat singing. Bandleader [[Cab Calloway]] exemplified the use of humorous scatting.<ref>{{harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=129}}</ref> Other examples of humorous scatting include [[Slim Gaillard]], [[Leo Watson]], and Bam Brown's 1945 song \"Avocado Seed Soup Symphony,\" in which the singers scat variations on the word \"avocado\" for much of the recording.<ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=627}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to such nonsensical uses of language, humor is communicated in scat singing through the use of [[musical quotation]]. Leo Watson, who performed before the canon of American popular music, frequently drew on nursery rhymes in his scatting. This is called using a compression.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=140}}</ref> Similarly, Ella Fitzgerald's scatting, for example, drew extensively on popular music. In her 1960 recording of \"[[How High the Moon]]\" live in Berlin, she quotes over a dozen songs, including \"[[The Peanut Vendor]],\" \"[[Heat Wave (Irving Berlin song)|Heat Wave]],\" \"[[A-Tisket, A-Tasket]],\" and \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]].\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=623}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Jolsonscat.ogg|title=\"That Haunting Melody\" (1911) excerpt|description=[[Al Jolson]]'s scatting during his 1911 recording of \"That Haunting Melody\" has been cited as one of the earliest examples of scat singing|pos=right|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nAlthough [[Louis Armstrong]]'s 1926 recording of \"[[Heebie Jeebies (composition)|Heebie Jeebies]]\" is often cited as the first song to employ scatting,<ref name=\"Crowther Pinfold 1997\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=618}}</ref> there are many earlier examples.<ref name=\"Edwards 2002 618-619\"/> One early master of ragtime scat singing was [[Gene Greene]] who recorded scat choruses in his song \"King of the Bungaloos\" and several others between 1911 and 1917.<ref name=\"Edwards 2002 619\">{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=619}}</ref> Entertainer [[Al Jolson]] scatted through a few bars in the middle of his 1911 recording of \"That Haunting Melody.\"<ref name=\"Gioia\">{{Harvnb|Gioia|2011|p=59}}</ref> Gene Green's 1917 \"From Here to Shanghai,\" which featured faux-Chinese scatting,<ref name=\"Edwards 2002 619\"/> and [[Gene Rodemich]]'s 1924 \"Scissor Grinder Joe\" and \"Some of These Days\" also pre-date Armstrong.<ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=619}}</ref> [[Cliff Edwards|Cliff \"Ukulele Ike\" Edwards]] scatted an interlude on his 1923 \"Old Fashioned Love\" in lieu of using an instrumental soloist.<ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=620}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=16}}</ref> One of the early female singers to use scat was [[Aileen Stanley]], who included it at the end of a duet with [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]] in their hit 1924 recording of \"[[It Had To Be You (song)|It Had To Be You]]\" (Victor 19373).\n\nJazz pianist [[Jelly Roll Morton]] credited Joe Sims of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], as the creator of scat around the turn of the 20th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholson|1993|p=89}}</ref> In a conversation between [[Alan Lomax]] and Jelly Roll Morton, Morton recounted the history of scat:<ref name=\"Hill 2014\">{{Harvnb|Hill|2014}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n'''Lomax''': \"Well, what about some more scat songs, that you used to sing way back then?\"\n<br />\n'''Morton''': \"Oh, I'll sing you some scat songs.

During the [[bop era]] of the 1940s, more highly developed vocal improvisation surged in popularity.<ref name=\"grove\"/> [[Annie Ross]], a bop singer, expressed a common sentiment among vocalists at the time: \"The [scat] music was so exciting, everyone wanted to do it.\"<ref name=\"cp130\"/> And many did: [[Eddie Jefferson]], [[Betty Carter]], [[Anita O'Day]], [[Joe Carroll (singer)|Joe Carroll]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Carmen McRae]], [[Jon Hendricks]], [[Babs Gonzales]], and [[Dizzy Gillespie]] were all singers in the idiom.<ref name=\"grove\"/> \n\nFree jazz and the influence of world musicians on the medium pushed jazz singing nearer to avant-garde art music.<ref name=\"grove\"/> In the 1960s [[Ward Swingle]] was the product of an unusually liberal musical education. He took the scat singing idea and applied it to the works of Bach, creating [[The Swingle Singers]]. Scat singing was also used by [[Louis Prima]] and others in the song \"[[I Wan'na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)|I Wan'na Be Like You]]\" in Disney's ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967).\n\nThe bop revival of the 1970s renewed interest in bop scat singing, and young scat singers viewed themselves as a continuation of the classic bop tradition. The medium continues to evolve, and vocal improvisation now often develops independently of changes in instrumental jazz.<ref name=\"grove\"/>\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, jazz artist John Paul Larkin (better known as [[Scatman John]]) renewed interest in the genre briefly when he began fusing jazz singing with [[pop music]] and [[electronica]], scoring a world-wide hit with the song \"[[Scatman (Ski Ba Bop Ba Dop Bop)]]\" in 1994. Vocal improviser [[Bobby McFerrin]]'s performances have shown that \"wordless singing has traveled far from the concepts demonstrated by Louis Armstrong, Gladys Bentley, Cab Calloway, Anita O'Day, and Leo Watson.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=135}}</ref>\n\n=== Vocal bass ===\nVocal bass is a form of scat singing that is intended to vocally simulate instrumental [[basslines]] that are typically performed by bass players. A technique most commonly used by bass singers in a cappella groups is to simulate an instrumental rhythm section, often alongside a [[Mouth drumming|vocal percussionist]] or [[beatboxer]]. Some notable vocal bass artists are [[Home Free (group)|Tim Foust]], [[Home Free (group)|Adam Chance]], [[Bobby McFerrin]], [[Al Jarreau]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[take 6|Alvin Chea]], [[DCappella|Joe Santoni]], [[Avi Kaplan]], [[Pentatonix|Scott Hoying]] and [[Pentatonix|Matt Sallee]].\n\n=== Use in hip hop  ===\nMany [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artists and [[rapper]]s use scat singing to come up with the rhythms of their raps.<ref name=\"Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC\">{{Harvnb|Edwards|2009|p=114}}</ref> [[Tajai]] of the group [[Souls of Mischief]] states the following in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'': \"Sometimes my rhythms come from scatting. I usually make a scat kind of skeleton and then fill in the words. I make a skeleton of the flow first, and then I put words into it.\"<ref name=\"Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC\"/> The group [[Lifesavas]] describe a similar process.<ref name=\"Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC\"/> Rapper [[Tech N9ne]] has been recorded demonstrating exactly how this method works,<ref>{{Harvnb|Godfrey|2010}}</ref> and gangsta rapper [[Eazy-E]] uses it extensively in his song \"[[Eternal E|Eazy Street]].\"\n\n== Historical theories  ==\n[[Image:Louis Armstrong restored.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Berliner (ethnomusicologist)|Paul Berliner]] has suggested that scat singing arose from instrumental soloists like [[Louis Armstrong]] (''pictured'') formulating jazz riffs vocally.<ref name=b181/>]]\n\nSome writers have proposed that scat has its roots in [[African music|African musical traditions]].<ref name=\"grove\"/> In much African music, \"human voice and instruments assume a kind of musical parity\" and are \"at times so close in timbre and so inextricably interwoven within the music's fabric as to be nearly indistinguishable.\"<ref name=b68>{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|p=68}}</ref> [[Dick Higgins]] likewise attributes scat singing to traditions of [[sound poetry]] in African-American music.<ref>{{Harvnb|Higgins|1985}}</ref> In [[West African music]], it is typical to convert drum rhythms into vocal melodies; common rhythmic patterns are assigned specific syllabic translations.<ref name=\"grove\">{{Harvnb|Robinson|2007}}</ref> However, this theory fails to account for the existence\u2014even in the earliest recorded examples of scatting\u2014of free improvisation by the vocalist.<ref name=\"grove\"/> It is therefore more likely that scat singing evolved independently in the United States.<ref name=\"grove\"/>\n\nOthers have proposed that scat singing arose from jazz musicians' practice of formulating riffs vocally before performing them instrumentally.<ref name=b181/> (The adage \"If you can't sing it, you can't play it\" was common in the early New Orleans jazz scene.<ref name=b181>{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|p=181}}</ref>) In this manner, soloists like Louis Armstrong became able to double as vocalists, switching effortlessly between instrumental solos and scatting.<ref name=b181/>\n\nScat singing also resembles the Irish/Scottish practice of [[lilting]] or diddling, a type of vocal music that involves using nonsensical syllables to sing non-vocal dance tunes.<ref>{{Harvnb|\u00d3 Nuall\u00e1in|2002|pp=306\u2013307}}</ref>\n\n== Critical assessment ==\nScat singing can allow jazz singers to have the same improvisational opportunities as jazz instrumentalists: scatting can be rhythmically and harmonically improvisational without concern about destroying the lyric.<ref name=cp132>{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=132}}</ref> Especially when [[bebop]] was developing, singers found scat to be the best way to adequately engage in the performance of jazz.<ref name=\"cp130\">{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=130}}</ref>\n\nScatting may be desirable because it does not \"taint the music with the impurity of denotation.\"<ref name=grant>{{Harvnb|Grant|1995|p=289}}</ref> Instead of conveying linguistic content and pointing to something outside itself, scat music\u2014like instrumental music\u2014is self-referential and \"d[oes] what it mean[s].\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Leonard|1986|p=158}}</ref> Through this wordlessness, commentators have written, scat singing can describe matters beyond words.<ref name=grant/><ref name=f37>{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=37}}</ref> Music critic [[Will Friedwald]] has written that Louis Armstrong's scatting, for example, \"has tapped into his own core of emotion,\" releasing emotions \"so deep, so real\" that they are unspeakable; his words \"bypass our ears and our brains and go directly for our hearts and souls.\"<ref name=f37/>\n\nScat singing has never been universally accepted, even by jazz enthusiasts. Writer and critic [[Leonard Feather]] offers an extreme view; he once said that \"scat singing\u2014with only a couple exceptions\u2014should be banned.\"<ref name=\"cp130\"/> He also wrote the lyrics to the jazz song \"[[Whisper Not (song)|Whisper Not]],\" which Ella Fitzgerald then recorded on her 1966 Verve release of the same name. Many jazz singers, including [[Bessie Smith]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Jimmy Rushing]], and [[Dinah Washington]], have avoided scat entirely.<ref name=g162>{{Harvnb|Giddins|2000|p=162}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Jazz}}\n* {{annotated link|Asemic writing}}\n* {{annotated link|Chopper (rap)}}\n* {{annotated link|Gibberish}}\n* {{annotated link|Glossolalia}}\n* {{annotated link|List of scat singers}}\n* {{annotated link|Literary nonsense}}\n* {{annotated link|Mumble rap}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Berliner\n | first = Paul\n | author-link = Paul Berliner (ethnomusicologist)\n | year = 1994\n | title = Thinking in Jazz: The Infinite Art of Improvisation\n | url = https://archive.org/details/thinkinginjazzin0000berl\n | url-access = registration\n | place = Chicago\n | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]\n | isbn = 978-0-226-04381-4\n | ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Crowther\n | first = Bruce\n | last2 = Pinfold\n | first2 = Mike\n | year = 1997\n | title = Singing Jazz\n | place = London\n | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sCH8GbRK214C\n | publisher = [[Miller Freeman, Inc. | Miller Freeman]] Books\n | isbn = 0-87930-519-3\n | ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n | last = Edwards\n | first = Brent Hayes\n | year = 2002\n | title = Louis Armstrong and the Syntax of Scat\n | periodical = [[Critical Inquiry]]\n | volume = 28\n | issue = 3\n | pages = 618\u2013649\n | issn = 0093-1896\n | doi = 10.1086/343233\n | ref = harv}}.

Dating from the 13th to the 7th centuries BC., there was thought to be over 5,000 tombs, although the most recent estimate suggests a figure of just under 4,000. They extend around the flanks of a large promontory located at the junction of the [[Anapo]] river with its tributary, the [[Calcinara]], about {{cvt|23|km}} northwest of Syracuse. Together with the city of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], Pantalica was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.\n\n==Geography==\n'''Pantalica''' is located on a limestone promontory surrounded by a deep gorge formed by the [[Anapo]] and [[Calcinara]] rivers between the towns of [[Ferla]] and [[Sortino]] in south-eastern [[Sicily]]. In addition to its archaeological interest it is an important nature reserve (Riserva Naturale Orientata Pantalica), with a variety of local flora and fauna and natural caves (notably the Grotta dei Pipistrelli (Bat Cave)). Various pathways facilitate visitor access, including a disused railway track (dismantled in 1956) along the Anapo valley bottom. The promontory can be accessed directly by car from Ferla, or by walking down the old mule track from the parking place on the road from Sortino and crossing over the Calcinara stream.\n\n[[File:Pantalica1770.jpg|thumb|Square rock-cut tombs in Pantalica]]\n[[File:Pantalica1757.jpg|thumb|Tomb entrance in Pantalica]]\n\n==History==\nIn the 13th century BC, some Sicilian coastal settlements were abandoned, possibly due to the arrival of the [[Sicels]] on the island and the onset of more unsettled conditions. New large sites, like Pantalica, appeared in the hilly coastal hinterlands, probably chosen for defensive reasons.{{Cite needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nPantalica evidently flourished for about 600 years, from about 1250 to 650 BC. The current name of the site probably dates from the Early Middle Ages or Arab period. The ancient name of the site is uncertain, but is associated by some archeologists with Hybla, after a Sicel king named Hyblon, who is mentioned by [[Thucydides]] in connection with the foundation of the early Greek colony at [[Megara Hyblaea]] in the year 728 BC. For several centuries before Greek colonization, Pantalica was undoubtedly one of the main sites of eastern Sicily, dominating the surrounding territory, including subsidiary settlements. By about 650 BC, however, it seems to have been a victim of the expansion of the city of Syracuse, which established an outpost at [[Akrai]] (near Palazzolo Acreide) at this time. Nevertheless, it was still occupied during classical antiquity, since finds of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC (Hellenistic period) are attested, as well as during the late antique or Byzantine periods. After the 12th century it was probably largely deserted, and overshadowed by Sortino.\n\nThe remains visible today consist mainly of numerous prehistoric [[burial chamber]]s cut into the limestone rock, sometimes provided with a porch or short entrance corridor in front of the burial chamber, originally sealed with stones or a slab. There are also some larger rock-cut houses of uncertain date, often said to be Byzantine, but possibly of earlier origin. The so-called ''anaktoron'', or princely palace, located near the top of the hill, is also controversial. Thought by some archeologists originally to have been a Late Bronze Age building, inspired by palatial buildings of the Greek (Mycenaean) Bronze Age, it was more certainly occupied in the Byzantine period. The remains of a large ditch, cut into the limestone, are clearly visible at Filiporto on the western side of the promontory, nearest to Ferla. This probably dates to the 4th century BC, and represents a defensive work of Greek military design, possibly in line with a policy of Dionysius of Syracuse, designed to secure allied sites in the hinterland. There are also three small medieval rock-cut chapels known respectively as the ''Grotta del Crocifisso'' (near the North cemetery), the ''Grotta di San Nicolicchio'' (on the southern side), and the ''Grotta di San Micidario'' (at Filiporto), which preserve very faint traces of frescoes, and attest the presence of small monastic communities.\n\nThe site was mainly excavated between 1895 and 1910 by the Italian archeologist, [[Paolo Orsi]], although most of the tombs had already been looted long before his time. The finds excavated by Orsi are on display in the Archaeological Museum in Syracuse. They include characteristic red-burnished pottery vessels and metal objects, including weaponry (small knives and daggers) and items of dress, such as bronze [[fibula (brooch)|fibulae (brooches)]] and rings, which were placed with the deceased in the tombs. Most of the tombs contained between one and seven individuals of all ages and both sexes. Many tombs were evidently re-opened periodically for more burials. The average human life span at this time was probably around 30 years of age.{{Cite needed|date=November 2014}} The size of the prehistoric population is hard to estimate from the available data, but might have been 1000 people or more.\n\n==Main monuments==\nPantalica has five cemeteries spread over a large area:\n* The '''necropolis of Filiporto''' consists of almost 1000 tombs, located on the southwestern side of the promontory (accessed by road from Ferla). In the same area are the remains of a defensive rock-cut ditch of later date (probably 4th century BC) traversing the promontory at its narrowest point.\n* The '''North West necropolis''' is one of the earliest (12th and 11th century BC), and is traversed by the tarmac road from Ferla.\n* The '''Cavetta necropolis''' has tombs and rock-cut houses of the prehistoric and later periods, and can be seen from the road and designated viewing platforms.\n* The '''North necropolis''' is a spectacular cemetery of about 1000 tombs covering very steep slopes overlooking the Calcinara river, best seen from the track coming from Sortino and from viewing platforms near the path. Remains of large rock-cut dwellings are on the gentler slopes to the east.\n* The '''South necropolis''' extends along the Anapo river for over 1 kilometre and is easily seen from the trackway at the bottom of the valley (a path leads down to it from the anaktoron). The old railway station, restored, has information about local fauna and flora.\n\nThe so-called '''Anaktoron''' (a Mycenaean princely palace) on the top of the hill is a multi-roomed building of large blocks, with various rectangular rooms, excavated in the 19th century by Paolo Orsi. Its origins are obscure (see above) but it was certainly used in the Byzantine period, as attested by roof tiles and pottery. Since no other prehistoric houses have been found on the hilltop, which is rather eroded, the location of the original prehistoric residential quarters remains uncertain. There may have been various clusters of habitation associated with each major burial zone.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* L. Bernabo Brea ''Sicily before the Greeks.'' (London: Thames and Hudson 1957).\n* R.

The ancient name of the site is uncertain, but is associated by some archeologists with Hybla, after a Sicel king named Hyblon, who is mentioned by [[Thucydides]] in connection with the foundation of the early Greek colony at [[Megara Hyblaea]] in the year 728 BC. For several centuries before Greek colonization, Pantalica was undoubtedly one of the main sites of eastern Sicily, dominating the surrounding territory, including subsidiary settlements. By about 650 BC, however, it seems to have been a victim of the expansion of the city of Syracuse, which established an outpost at [[Akrai]] (near Palazzolo Acreide) at this time. Nevertheless, it was still occupied during classical antiquity, since finds of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC (Hellenistic period) are attested, as well as during the late antique or Byzantine periods. After the 12th century it was probably largely deserted, and overshadowed by Sortino.\n\nThe remains visible today consist mainly of numerous prehistoric [[burial chamber]]s cut into the limestone rock, sometimes provided with a porch or short entrance corridor in front of the burial chamber, originally sealed with stones or a slab. There are also some larger rock-cut houses of uncertain date, often said to be Byzantine, but possibly of earlier origin. The so-called ''anaktoron'', or princely palace, located near the top of the hill, is also controversial. Thought by some archeologists originally to have been a Late Bronze Age building, inspired by palatial buildings of the Greek (Mycenaean) Bronze Age, it was more certainly occupied in the Byzantine period. The remains of a large ditch, cut into the limestone, are clearly visible at Filiporto on the western side of the promontory, nearest to Ferla. This probably dates to the 4th century BC, and represents a defensive work of Greek military design, possibly in line with a policy of Dionysius of Syracuse, designed to secure allied sites in the hinterland. There are also three small medieval rock-cut chapels known respectively as the ''Grotta del Crocifisso'' (near the North cemetery), the ''Grotta di San Nicolicchio'' (on the southern side), and the ''Grotta di San Micidario'' (at Filiporto), which preserve very faint traces of frescoes, and attest the presence of small monastic communities.\n\nThe site was mainly excavated between 1895 and 1910 by the Italian archeologist, [[Paolo Orsi]], although most of the tombs had already been looted long before his time. The finds excavated by Orsi are on display in the Archaeological Museum in Syracuse. They include characteristic red-burnished pottery vessels and metal objects, including weaponry (small knives and daggers) and items of dress, such as bronze [[fibula (brooch)|fibulae (brooches)]] and rings, which were placed with the deceased in the tombs. Most of the tombs contained between one and seven individuals of all ages and both sexes. Many tombs were evidently re-opened periodically for more burials. The average human life span at this time was probably around 30 years of age.{{Cite needed|date=November 2014}} The size of the prehistoric population is hard to estimate from the available data, but might have been 1000 people or more.\n\n==Main monuments==\nPantalica has five cemeteries spread over a large area:\n* The '''necropolis of Filiporto''' consists of almost 1000 tombs, located on the southwestern side of the promontory (accessed by road from Ferla). In the same area are the remains of a defensive rock-cut ditch of later date (probably 4th century BC) traversing the promontory at its narrowest point.\n* The '''North West necropolis''' is one of the earliest (12th and 11th century BC), and is traversed by the tarmac road from Ferla.\n* The '''Cavetta necropolis''' has tombs and rock-cut houses of the prehistoric and later periods, and can be seen from the road and designated viewing platforms.\n* The '''North necropolis''' is a spectacular cemetery of about 1000 tombs covering very steep slopes overlooking the Calcinara river, best seen from the track coming from Sortino and from viewing platforms near the path. Remains of large rock-cut dwellings are on the gentler slopes to the east.\n* The '''South necropolis''' extends along the Anapo river for over 1 kilometre and is easily seen from the trackway at the bottom of the valley (a path leads down to it from the anaktoron). The old railway station, restored, has information about local fauna and flora.\n\nThe so-called '''Anaktoron''' (a Mycenaean princely palace) on the top of the hill is a multi-roomed building of large blocks, with various rectangular rooms, excavated in the 19th century by Paolo Orsi. Its origins are obscure (see above) but it was certainly used in the Byzantine period, as attested by roof tiles and pottery. Since no other prehistoric houses have been found on the hilltop, which is rather eroded, the location of the original prehistoric residential quarters remains uncertain. There may have been various clusters of habitation associated with each major burial zone.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* L. Bernabo Brea ''Sicily before the Greeks.'' (London: Thames and Hudson 1957).\n* R.

Angel has a \"street family\" made up of aging movie cowboy Kit Carson ([[Rory Calhoun]]), street performer Yoyo Charlie (Steven M. Porter), transvestite Mae ([[Dick Shawn]]), fellow hookers Crystal (Donna McDaniel) and Lana (Graem McGavin), and her landlord, eccentric painter Solly Mosler ([[Susan Tyrrell]]).\n\nThe street's dangers increase as a psycho-necrophiliac serial killer ([[John Diehl]]) begins to stalk and murder prostitutes. Los Angeles Police Lt. Andrews ([[Cliff Gorman]]) is assigned to the case, but finds no leads. Tragedy strikes Angel's group of friends when Crystal becomes a victim.\n\nThe next day at school, Molly is confronted by teacher Patricia Allen ([[Elaine Giftos]]), who is concerned about Molly's lack of extracurricular activities. Molly explains that her mother was paralyzed by a [[stroke]] and she has to head home immediately after school each day to care for her.\n\nLt. Andrews advises the hookers to work in pairs. Angel teams up with her partner, Lana. Lana takes a potential client to a motel room that she and Angel share.  When Angel shows up at the room with a client of her own a couple of hours later she finds Lana's body in the shower. Angel gives the police a description of the suspect and a composite sketch is made. The killer is brought in for a lineup and Angel recognizes him, but he shoots his way out of the police station and escapes.\n\nAndrews takes Molly/Angel home to speak with her parents, but discovers that Molly's father left nine years ago and her mother abandoned her three years ago. Molly maintains the pretense of a mother at home so that she will not be sent to a foster home. She believes that her father will return someday. She has paid her rent, school tuition and living expenses through prostitution since she was 12.\n\nDespite Andrews' warnings to stay off the street, Angel/Molly purchases a pistol and returns to work. Her masquerade falls apart that night when some classmates recognize her on the street. Word flashes through the students at her school and soon everyone knows that Molly spends her evenings as a Hollywood hooker.\n\nThe next day, Ms. Allen visits Molly's apartment and insists on meeting her mother. Mae pretends to be Molly's mother, but Allen is not fooled. Mae is still at the apartment when the killer shows up later. They fight, and he stabs her, leaving her mortally wounded. Solly discovers Mae and the two share a tender moment of friendship before Mae succumbs to her wounds.\n\nAndrews and Molly return to her apartment and find Mae's body. Molly heads out on the streets with Solly's huge long-barreled Magnum to avenge Mae and Andrews goes after her. After a fight and chase, Carson, whom Andrews enlisted to help, shoots the killer. Molly, Andrews, and a wounded Carson walk off together and the film fades to black.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Donna Wilkes]] as Molly 'Angel' Stewart\n* [[Cliff Gorman]] as Lt.

The sequels were ''[[Avenging Angel (1985 film)|Avenging Angel]]'' (1985), starring [[Betsy Russell]], ''Angel III: The Final Chapter'' (1988), starring [[Mitzi Kapture]], and ''Angel 4: Undercover'' (1993), starring [[Darlene Vogel]]. All three of them were commercial failures at the box office.\n\n==Production==\nLead actress [[Donna Wilkes]] was actually twenty-four years old when she played fifteen-year-old Molly Stuart in this film. She prepared for the role by talking to real-life street prostitutes on Hollywood Boulevard, spent time with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], and in various halfway houses for underage children living on the streets of [[Los Angeles]].\n\nComposer [[Craig Safan]] wrote the [[Film score|score]] to this film in less than a week.

Angel has a \"street family\" made up of aging movie cowboy Kit Carson ([[Rory Calhoun]]), street performer Yoyo Charlie (Steven M. Porter), transvestite Mae ([[Dick Shawn]]), fellow hookers Crystal (Donna McDaniel) and Lana (Graem McGavin), and her landlord, eccentric painter Solly Mosler ([[Susan Tyrrell]]).\n\nThe street's dangers increase as a psycho-necrophiliac serial killer ([[John Diehl]]) begins to stalk and murder prostitutes. Los Angeles Police Lt. Andrews ([[Cliff Gorman]]) is assigned to the case, but finds no leads. Tragedy strikes Angel's group of friends when Crystal becomes a victim.\n\nThe next day at school, Molly is confronted by teacher Patricia Allen ([[Elaine Giftos]]), who is concerned about Molly's lack of extracurricular activities. Molly explains that her mother was paralyzed by a [[stroke]] and she has to head home immediately after school each day to care for her.\n\nLt. Andrews advises the hookers to work in pairs. Angel teams up with her partner, Lana. Lana takes a potential client to a motel room that she and Angel share.  When Angel shows up at the room with a client of her own a couple of hours later she finds Lana's body in the shower. Angel gives the police a description of the suspect and a composite sketch is made. The killer is brought in for a lineup and Angel recognizes him, but he shoots his way out of the police station and escapes.\n\nAndrews takes Molly/Angel home to speak with her parents, but discovers that Molly's father left nine years ago and her mother abandoned her three years ago. Molly maintains the pretense of a mother at home so that she will not be sent to a foster home. She believes that her father will return someday. She has paid her rent, school tuition and living expenses through prostitution since she was 12.\n\nDespite Andrews' warnings to stay off the street, Angel/Molly purchases a pistol and returns to work. Her masquerade falls apart that night when some classmates recognize her on the street. Word flashes through the students at her school and soon everyone knows that Molly spends her evenings as a Hollywood hooker.\n\nThe next day, Ms. Allen visits Molly's apartment and insists on meeting her mother. Mae pretends to be Molly's mother, but Allen is not fooled. Mae is still at the apartment when the killer shows up later. They fight, and he stabs her, leaving her mortally wounded. Solly discovers Mae and the two share a tender moment of friendship before Mae succumbs to her wounds.\n\nAndrews and Molly return to her apartment and find Mae's body. Molly heads out on the streets with Solly's huge long-barreled Magnum to avenge Mae and Andrews goes after her. After a fight and chase, Carson, whom Andrews enlisted to help, shoots the killer. Molly, Andrews, and a wounded Carson walk off together and the film fades to black.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Donna Wilkes]] as Molly 'Angel' Stewart\n* [[Cliff Gorman]] as Lt.

It is played with a deck of 24, 28, or 32 standard [[playing card]]s. Normally there are four players, two on each team, although there are [[euchre game variations|variations]] for from two to nine players. \n\nEuchre was responsible for introducing the [[Joker (playing card)|joker]] into the modern deck of cards. The Joker Deck was introduced to Americanized ''Euchre'' around 1860 with the joker acting as a top [[Trump (card games)|trump]] or best Bower (from the German word ''Bauer'', \"farmer\", denoting also the [[Jack (playing card)|Jack]] &ndash; see [[Bester Bube]]).<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of Card Games'', David Parlett, p. 104</ref> Euchre is believed to be closely related to the French game [[\u00c9cart\u00e9]],<ref>''The Everything Card Games Book: A Complete Guide to Over 50 Games'', p. 128, Nikki Katz, {{ISBN|1-59337-130-6}}</ref> the seventeenth-century game [[Lanterloo|Loo]], and the 19th-century game ''Juckerspiel''. It may be sometimes referred to as Knock Euchre to distinguish it from [[Bid Euchre]].\n\n==Origins and popularity==\n[[File:\"Euchered\" LCCN2001697234.jpg|thumb|\"Euchered\"; lithograph (1884) from the Library of Congress]]\n\nThere are several theories regarding the origins of Euchre. One theory is that Euchre was brought into the United States by the early German settlers of [[Pennsylvania]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Notes and Queries: A Medium of Inter-communication for Literary Men, Artists, Antiquaries, Genealogists, Etc|volume=1|publisher=[[George Bell & Sons|Bell and Daldy]]|date=31 May 1862|p=427}}</ref> and from that region was disseminated throughout the nation. The 1864 edition of ''The American Hoyle'' disputes its alleged German heritage, tracing the game's origin to Pennsylvania in the 1820s. It goes on to surmise that a \"rich German farmer's daughter\" had visited Philadelphia and carried home a confused memory of [[Ecart\u00e9]] which then developed into Euchre.{{sfn|\"Trumps\"|1864|p=57}}\n\nAnother hypothesis is that the game derives from an eighteenth-century [[Alsace|Alsatian]] card game named [[Juckerspiel]],<ref>[http://www.parlettgames.uk/histocs/euchre.html Parlett's Historic Card Games: Euchre]</ref> a derivative of [[Triomphe]]. It may have been introduced by immigrants from [[Cornwall]], UK, where it remains a popular game. It is also played in the neighboring county of Devon; one theory is that it was introduced there by French or American prisoners of war imprisoned in Dartmoor Prison during the early 19th century. [[Ombre]] is an ancestral form of Euchre.<ref>Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, David Parlett, pg. 124 {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}</ref>\n\nThe game was regarded as the national card game of the United States in the late 19th century{{sfn|Trumps|1864|p=72}} but has declined in popularity, although it retains a strong following in some regions, such as the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wisconsinlife.org/story/wisconsins-passion-euchre |title=Wisconsin's Passion For Euchre |first=Breann |last=Schossow |website=Wisconsin Life |publisher=[[Wisconsin Public Radio]] |date=February 21, 2014 |accessdate=June 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe game retains its popularity in [[Canada]] as well, particularly in [[Ontario]], and is commonly seen as a social game, with community tournaments held in bars or community centres. According to [[David Parlett|Parlett]] it may be described as Canada's national card game.{{sfn|Parlett|1991|p=190}}\n\n==The deal==\nEuchre is a four-player [[Suit (cards)#Trumps|trump]] game, wherein the players are paired to form two partnerships.<ref name =UNO>Tim Ander. How to Play Euchre: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Learning the Euchre Card Game Instructions, Scoring & Strategies to Win at Playing Euchre. 46 pag. (2018). {{ISBN|1976880068}}, {{ISBN|978-1976880063}}</ref> Standard Euchre uses a deck of 24 [[playing card]]s consisting of {{Cards|A}}, {{Cards|K}}, {{Cards|Q}}, {{Cards|J}}, {{Cards|10}}, and {{Cards|9}} of each of the four [[suit (cards)|suits]]. A 52-card deck can be used, omitting the cards from {{Cards|2}} to {{Cards|8}}, or a [[Pinochle]] deck may be divided in half to form two Euchre decks. Sometimes, a 32-card [[Piquet]] or [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] deck is used, which includes the {{Cards|8}}s and {{Cards|7}}s.<ref name =UNO/>\n\nEach player is dealt five cards (seven if using the 32-card deck) in clockwise order in two rounds. A \"cut\" is sometimes offered by the dealer to the player to the right. In some variations, the cut must be requested.\n\nThe remaining four cards are called the \"kitty\" and are placed face down in front of the dealer. The top card of the kitty is turned face up, and bidding begins. The dealer asks each player in turn if they would like the suit of the top card to be trump, which they indicate by saying either \"pick it up\" or \"pass\".<ref name =UNO/> If the choice comes around to the dealer, the dealer can either pick the card up or flip it over. If the dealer acquires the top card (either by being ordered to pick it up or choosing to pick it up), the top card becomes part of the dealer's hand, the dealer then discarding a card to the kitty, face down. If no one orders up the top card and the dealer also chooses not to pick it up, each player is then given the opportunity, in turn, to call a different suit as trump. If no trump is selected, it is a \"misdeal\", and the deal is passed clockwise.\n\nWhen a suit is named trump, the jack in the suit of the same colour becomes a member of this trump suit. Any card of that (expanded) suit outranks any card of a non-trump suit. The highest-ranking card in Euchre is the jack of the trump suit and is called the \"right bower\" or \"right\"; the other jack of the same colour is called the \"left bower\" or \"left\". The cards are ranked, in descending order, {{Cards|J}} (of trump suit), {{Cards|J}} (same colour as trump suit), {{Cards|A}}, {{Cards|K}}, {{Cards|Q}}, {{Cards|10}}, and {{Cards|9}} of the trump suit.<ref name =UNO/> The remaining cards rank in the usual order (the off-colour Jacks are not special) and the cards of those suits ranked, in descending order, {{Cards|A}}, {{Cards|K}}, {{Cards|Q}}, {{Cards|J}}, {{Cards|10}}, and {{Cards|9}}.\n\n===Example===\nAssume a hand is dealt and that Spades are named as trump. In this event, the trump cards are as follows, from highest-ranking to lowest:\n# {{Cards|J|rank_name=full}} of Spades (right bower)\n# {{Cards|J|rank_name=full}} of Clubs (left bower)\n# {{Cards|A|rank_name=full}} of Spades\n# {{Cards|K|rank_name=full}} of Spades\n# {{Cards|Q|rank_name=full}} of Spades\n# {{Cards|10|rank_name=full}} of Spades\n# {{Cards|9|rank_name=full}} of Spades\n\nThe Jack of Clubs becomes a spade during the playing of this hand. This expands the trump suit to the seven cards named above and reduces the suit of the same colour by one card (its jack being loaned to the trump suit). Once the hand is finished, the Jack of Clubs ceases to be a spade and becomes a club again unless spades are again named as trump during the playing of a subsequent hand.\n\n==The play==\n\n===Overview, objective, and scoring===\nWhen naming a suit, a player asserts that their partnership intends to win the majority of tricks of the hand. A single point is scored when the bid succeeds, and two points are scored if the team that declared trump takes all five tricks (called a \"[[march (cards)|march]]\"). A failure of the calling partnership to win three tricks is referred to as being \"euchred\", and that partnership is penalized by giving the opposing partnership two points.<ref name =UNO/>\n\nA caller with exceptionally good cards can \"go alone\", in which case they seek to win the march without a partner. The partner of a caller in a lone hand does not play, and if the caller achieves the march, the winning team scores 4 points. If only three or four of the tricks are taken while going alone, then only one point is scored. If euchred while playing alone, the opposing team still only receives 2 points.\n\nThe primary rule to remember when playing Euchre is that one is never required to play the trump suit (unless that is the one that is led), but one is required to follow suit if possible. (e.g., if diamonds are led, a player with diamonds is required to play a diamond.)\n\n===Calling round (naming trump)===\nOnce the cards are dealt and the top card on the kitty is turned over, the upturned card's suit is offered as trump to the players in clockwise order beginning with the player to the left of the dealer (called the \"eldest\"). Team members are generally discouraged or explicitly forbidden to discuss their preferred choice(s) of trump, covered by the [[Euchre#Table talking|rules forbidding table talk]]. If a player wishes the proposed suit to be named trump, they order up the card and the dealer adds that card to their hand. It is usually more advantageous to the dealer's team to select trump in this way, as the dealer necessarily gains one trump card. The dealer must then also discard a card face down from their hand, in order to return their hand to having a total of five cards. This discard is an important tactical decision, as the dealer can potentially create a \"void\" or \"short suit\" in their hand, where they lack any cards of a particular suit. That would allow them to play a trump card instead of being forced to follow that voided suit when it is led (see the later section on winning tricks, and \"two-suited\" in the Terminology section). If the player instead opts to pass, the option proceeds to the player to the left until either a player orders the card up or all players have passed.<ref>Euchre Explained. Nick Buzzy. 52 pag. ASIN: B004KAB9QU</ref>\n\nIf all players pass, the top card is turned face down and that suit may no longer be chosen as trump. Trump selection proceeds clockwise beginning with the player to the left of the dealer, where the player may name a suit different from that of the previous up-card as trump, or they may pass. No card is ordered up in this round. If all players pass again, it is declared a misdeal. The deal passes to the player on the previous dealer's left, who reshuffles and deals a new hand. (A variation called \"Stick the Dealer\", also referred to as \"hanging\" or \"screwing\" the dealer, is sometimes played, where the dealer is forced to call trump in this situation.)\n\nThe team that selects trump is known as the \"makers\" for the remainder of the hand, and the opposing team is known as the \"defenders\". The makers must take at least three of the five tricks in the hand in order to avoid being euchred.\n\n===Winning tricks===\nThe player to the dealer's left begins play by leading any card of any suit, including trumps. Play continues in clockwise order; each player must follow suit if they have a card of the suit led. The left bower is considered a member of the trump suit and not a member of its native suit.\n\nThe player who played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick, unless a trump is played; then the highest trump card wins the trick. Players who play neither the suit led nor trump cannot win the trick. The player who won the trick collects the played cards from the table, turns the cards face down, and then leads to the next trick.\n\nAfter all five rounds have been played, the hand is scored. The player to the left of the previous dealer then deals the next hand, and the deal moves clockwise around the table until one partnership scores 10 points and wins the game.\n\n===Going alone===\nIf the player bidding and making trump has an exceptionally good hand, that player has the option of playing without their partner and partner's cards. If that player then wins all five tricks, the team scores four points.\n\n\"Going alone\"<ref>Safire's political dictionary, p. 283, William Safire &ndash; Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-19-534334-2}}<br />''American politicians have been either proud of themselves or critical of others for \"going it alone\" since about 1850, when card players began using this phrase to designate a player's decision to take in their tricks without the help of their partner. It may only be called by the person declaring trump, not their partner.''</ref> is initiated at the time the bidder orders the upturned card on the kitty to the dealer or names a suit. The bidder signifies their desire to play alone by saying so after bidding. The bidder must make this call before play begins. During a ''loner'' or lone hand, the bidder's partner discards their cards, and does not participate in play of the hand. In some regional variants (see below), if the dealer's partner \"calls them up\"/\"orders it up\" (on the turned up card), they are obliged to go alone for that hand.\n\nDefending alone: If a player chooses to make trump, the defending team can choose to go alone. If all five tricks are taken by the defending team, the defending team will receive 4 points. In most Canadian variations this is not allowed and only the team making trump may decide to \"go alone\".\n\nThe odds of success of a lone hand depend on the lay of the cards and the inactive cards held by the bidder's partner. Nine cards out of twenty-four do not participate in play, making the hand less predictable than it would be otherwise. A hand consisting of the top five cards of the trump suit is mathematically unbeatable from any position; this is sometimes referred to as a \"lay-down\", as a player with such a hand may often simply lay all five cards on the table at once.\n\n===Scoring===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0 0.5em;\"\n|+ Scoring in euchre\n|-\n!

Some players choose to play \"win by two\" where there is no winner until a team has more than 10 points and 2 points more than the other team. Winning a game 10\u20130 is known as \"skunking\" in the US.\n\n====Scorekeeping markers====\nScores can be kept by using two otherwise unused cards as markers, with each team often using cards of the same colour.\n\nOne method involves using the {{cards|4}} and {{cards|6}} cards. Scoring begins using one card face up, covered by the other card face down. Upon winning points, the top card is moved to reveal the appropriate number of suit symbols on the bottom card. After all points are revealed on the lower card, the top card is flipped over, adding pips on both cards to indicate the score.<ref name =UNO/>\n\nA variation of scorekeeping in Western New York and Ontario involves each side using the {{cards|2}} and {{cards|3}} of one suit. Scoring starts with counting the symbols on the cards, for points 1 to 4; at 5, the cards are turned over and crossed. Crossing the cards indicates 5 points. Points 6 to 9 are counted similarly by counting the number of suit symbols showing and adding them to the 5, when the cards are crossed.\n\nIn Canada and Michigan, it is common for each team to use two {{cards|5}}s of the same colour to keep score, with one team red and the other black. The {{cards|5}}s are usually referred to as \"counting cards\" in this situation.\n\n===Betting===\nBetting takes place after the trump is determined, but before the first card is led to the first trick. Betting can start with an [[ante (poker)|ante]] or forced bet. The defenders can either check on the bid and bid nothing, thereby likely losing their ante; call the bid; or &ndash; if they feel confident that they can Euchre &ndash; raise the bid. Once a bet has been settled by a call on the bid, the hand plays out, with the winners of the bet adding that bet to their pot. After a game has been won, the winning team then splits the pot between the two winners and the game can end. Some variants can be played over multiple games.\n\nBetting in Euchre can also be done on a per-trick basis or a per point basis. At the end of the game, the losing team owes the winning team the difference in points based on the monetary value set per point.\n\n===Table talk===\nCommunicating with one's partner to influence their play, called [[table talk (cards)|table talk]] or cross-boarding, is considered cheating. This can include code words, secret gestures, or other forms of cooperative play. Depending on house rules, table talk can result in replaying of a hand or awarding of a point to the team calling out the infraction.\n\nSome variations allow (or at least accept the inevitability of) the minor non-verbal communication in that a player may hesitate before passing on trump selection to signal to their partner that their cards are helpful to the offered trump, but are not sufficient to guarantee a win.  Conversely, the player may pass quickly or blatantly to indicate their cards are very poor for the available trump choice (possibly indicating their partner should go alone if they select that trump). This adds an additional element of strategy in that players may bluff a quick pass or hesitation to trick their opponents into calling or declining the offered trump; however, this can naturally backfire by confusing the player's own teammate. Depending on the playing group, couples or good friends may be purposely put onto opposing teams, because of the perceived advantage they may have reading one another as teammates.\n\n===Reneging===\nIf a player does not follow suit when they are able to (usually by playing a trump card instead), it is considered a [[renege]] (or revoke), and the opposing team is awarded two points if it is caught in later tricks of the same hand or two points can be deducted from the offending team.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hoyle's rules of games : descriptions of indoor games of skill and chance, with advice on skillful play : based on the foundations laid down by Edmond Hoyle, 1672&ndash;1769|date=2001|publisher=Plume|others=Hoyle, Edmond, 1672&ndash;1769., Morehead, Albert H.

In some variants, reneging when a player or their opponent is going alone may result in a penalty of four points, equally applicable to the maker of trump and the opposing team, in order to equalize the potential values of a hand. Usually, reneging on purpose is considered cheating and is strongly discouraged among communities that consider cheating or lying to be unethical. Players caught repeatedly reneging on purpose are often ostracized from future card playing events.\n\n==Variations==\n{{main|Euchre game variations}}\n[[File:A Game of Auchre.tif|thumb|Shows three men\u2014Jack the black packer, \"Harry my friend\" the digger, and Ah Sin the Chinese [[fossicking|fossicker]]\u2014playing euchre. Ah Sin won.]]\n\nEuchre is a game with a large number of variant versions. They include versions for two to nine players, as well as changes in cards used, bidding, play, and scoring.\n\n'''No trump''': After the first round (once the kitty's top card has been turned down), \"no trump\" may be called. The first card played for each trick establishes that trick's suit,{{clarify|date=March 2020}} with normal deck order (ace high) taking precedence.\n\n'''Stick the dealer''' or '''screw the dealer''': The dealer must call trump at the end of the second round and is unable to declare a misdeal. This variation is often used to keep the game moving quickly.\n\n'''Going under''' or '''bottoms''' or '''farmer's hand''': A player with a hand with at least three {{cards|9}} or {{cards|10}} cards can exchange three of these cards with the three unknown cards in the kitty. This must be performed before trump has been selected.\n\nAnother variant of the \"farmer's hand\" rules states that if a player receives all {{cards|9}}s and {{cards|10}}s, they may call for a redeal. The dealer may not exercise this option (because they pick up the card from the kitty).\n\nIn some variations, a player may not call trump with only a jack and must have another card of the same suit if they wish to call it. Sometimes this only applies to the dealer, and if a player is caught doing this, it is often treated as a renege.\n\n'''Robson rules''': When a team wins all five tricks (normally or by going alone), they may choose to reduce the opposing team's score (by two or four, respectively) instead of adding to their own score. Additionally, if the dealer turns up a jack on the kitty, they may elect to go alone without seeing the rest of their hand. If all tricks are won via this \"blind loner\" hand, five points are awarded instead of the usual four; but a failure to win all tricks earns the defenders one point. This rule set was named for four-time [[Northern Michigan]] regional tournament runner-up champion James Robson.\n\n'''No ace, no face, no trump''': If a player is dealt a hand which once trump is called contains no aces, face cards, or the suit which is trump they may reveal their hand before cards have been played, stating \"no ace, no face, no trump\"; and all players must throw their cards in and the hand is re-dealt.\n\n'''Three-handed Euchre''': A variant for three players, three-handed Euchre is played like 24-card Euchre, with the following changes:\n* Players play alone, rather than in teams.\n* Each player plays to ten points, and keeps their own score (using {{cards|4}}s and {{cards|6}}s as markers)\n* Seven cards are dealt to each player, leaving three in the kitty (top card is turned up).\n* The person who makes trump is the \"maker\". Both other players are \"defenders\", but compete with each other for tricks.\n* If the maker takes four tricks, they receive one point. If the maker takes six tricks, they receive two points. Taking all seven tricks gives the maker four points.\n* If the maker does not take four tricks, they are euchred (set). The defender who took the most tricks will then receive two points. If both defenders took an equal number of tricks, they each receive one point.\n\n'''Ace no face''': If someone is dealt a hand that contains any number of aces but has no face cards, they may lay their cards on the table and call \"ace no face\". This is considered a misdeal, and all the cards are gathered and re-dealt.\n\n'''Queens Mulligan''': If a player has 3 Queens, they can call \"queens mulligan\" when it's their turn to bid, and all the cards are gathered and a new player becomes the dealer.\n\nMany of these variations are specific to a particular region. In Australia and New Zealand, playing to eleven rather than ten points is common. In southwestern England, [[Cornwall]], and [[Guernsey]], variations with a joker as highest trump are played. In [[Ontario]], parts of New Zealand, and in the British and Australian versions of the game, after the dealer turns up the top card on the kitty if the first player to the left passes and the dealer's partner would like to order up the dealer, the dealer's partner must play alone.<ref>[http://falmoutheuchre.orgfree.com/thewayweplay.html An introduction into the way we play Euchre in our league. Penryn, Falmouth & District Euchre League 2014. \"This player will pass or order up the dealer, in the case of the first player passing the second player (dealers Partner) may do like wise, but if they order the dealer they will go alone.\"]</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nEuchre terminology varies greatly from region to region, and is highly colloquial. Some examples include:\n* Bump or getting \"euchred\" or \"set\": Occurs when the opposing team wins more tricks than the team who called the suit.\n* Farmer's Hand, Poor Man's Hand, Bottom Hand, Grandma's Hand: Certain weak hands (usually those containing no {{cards|A|rank_name=full}}s or face cards ({{cards|K|rank_name=full}}s, {{cards|Q|rank_name=full}}s, or {{cards|J|rank_name=full}}s), but only {{cards|9}}s and {{cards|10}}s), are designated as \"farmer's hands\" or \"bottoms\". After inspecting the hand dealt, a player may call out \"farmer's hand\" and is then allowed to show the cards in question and exchange three of them for the three unexposed cards in the kitty (also called \"going under\" or \"under the table\").\n* Ace No Face: Similar to \"farmers hand\". In Ace No Face the player must have one {{cards|A|rank_name=full}} and all {{cards|9}}s and {{cards|10}}s in their hand. The player then calls \"ace no face\" and exchanges three of their cards for the bottom three (must be called before the first card of the beginning trick has been led).\n* Euchre Bustle: Name for a Euchre tournament (used in northern Midwest of United States).\n* Lay-Down: A hand that will automatically win all five tricks if played in the correct order: for example, a Dutchman (both Bowers and the {{cards|A|rank_name=full}} of trumps) plus the {{cards|K|rank_name=full}} and {{cards|Q|rank_name=full}} of that suit, any other two trump cards, or one more trump card and an off-trump {{cards|A|rank_name=full}} (when that player has the lead). It is also called a Loner, or Lone Wolf, because a player with such a hand will typically opt to go alone. It may also refer to any set of cards that are often played when the player knows they will win all the tricks they lay for. This, however, may only be done within the same suit without giving up a slight advantage to the other players.\n* Screw the Dealer, or Stick the Dealer: An optional rule that states that if trump is not called it must be called by the dealer, who is last to act. Mainly used as a method to speed up the game, as it eliminates throw-in hands.\n* Trump the Partner: Refers to a situation where the last player plays the card that wins a trick that their partner would have otherwise won. It usually refers to a situation where the partner has an {{cards|A|rank_name=full}} that follows suit and the player plays a trump card, but playing a higher trump or non-trump than the partner's qualifies.\n* Loner Range: When a team reaches 6 points they are referred to as in \"Loner Range\" because they need 4 or less points (a successful going-alone is worth 4 points) to reach 10 points and win a game. Alternatively, it can also be used to describe being 4 points away from the opposing team. For example, when it is 4 to 8, the losing team is in \"Loner Range\" below the winning team.\n* Throwing in: Because there is no reward for winning four of the five tricks it is often customary for the leading player of the offensive team to throw the remainder of their cards into the centre once three tricks have been assured but five tricks is impossible. This is because one trick has already been won by the opposing team or they are certain that all the tricks cannot be won. (e.g. a right bower was ordered up but has not been played once three tricks have been won) The cards are thrown face up to show the opposing team the inevitability of their winning three tricks or the impossibility of winning all.\n* The Mike: When an individual calls Trump and then, between their partner and themselves, proceed to not win a single trick resulting in a Euchre.\n\n==See also==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n* [[500 (card game)|500]]\n* [[Boston (card game)|Boston]]\n* [[Clabber]]\n* [[Dirty clubs]]\n* [[Euchre game variations]]\n* [[Skat (card game)|Skat]]\n* [[Whist]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Matthews, Thomas (1844).

It is played with a deck of 24, 28, or 32 standard [[playing card]]s. Normally there are four players, two on each team, although there are [[euchre game variations|variations]] for from two to nine players. \n\nEuchre was responsible for introducing the [[Joker (playing card)|joker]] into the modern deck of cards. The Joker Deck was introduced to Americanized ''Euchre'' around 1860 with the joker acting as a top [[Trump (card games)|trump]] or best Bower (from the German word ''Bauer'', \"farmer\", denoting also the [[Jack (playing card)|Jack]] &ndash; see [[Bester Bube]]).<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of Card Games'', David Parlett, p. 104</ref> Euchre is believed to be closely related to the French game [[\u00c9cart\u00e9]],<ref>''The Everything Card Games Book: A Complete Guide to Over 50 Games'', p. 128, Nikki Katz, {{ISBN|1-59337-130-6}}</ref> the seventeenth-century game [[Lanterloo|Loo]], and the 19th-century game ''Juckerspiel''. It may be sometimes referred to as Knock Euchre to distinguish it from [[Bid Euchre]].\n\n==Origins and popularity==\n[[File:\"Euchered\" LCCN2001697234.jpg|thumb|\"Euchered\"; lithograph (1884) from the Library of Congress]]\n\nThere are several theories regarding the origins of Euchre. One theory is that Euchre was brought into the United States by the early German settlers of [[Pennsylvania]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Notes and Queries: A Medium of Inter-communication for Literary Men, Artists, Antiquaries, Genealogists, Etc|volume=1|publisher=[[George Bell & Sons|Bell and Daldy]]|date=31 May 1862|p=427}}</ref> and from that region was disseminated throughout the nation. The 1864 edition of ''The American Hoyle'' disputes its alleged German heritage, tracing the game's origin to Pennsylvania in the 1820s. It goes on to surmise that a \"rich German farmer's daughter\" had visited Philadelphia and carried home a confused memory of [[Ecart\u00e9]] which then developed into Euchre.{{sfn|\"Trumps\"|1864|p=57}}\n\nAnother hypothesis is that the game derives from an eighteenth-century [[Alsace|Alsatian]] card game named [[Juckerspiel]],<ref>[http://www.parlettgames.uk/histocs/euchre.html Parlett's Historic Card Games: Euchre]</ref> a derivative of [[Triomphe]]. It may have been introduced by immigrants from [[Cornwall]], UK, where it remains a popular game. It is also played in the neighboring county of Devon; one theory is that it was introduced there by French or American prisoners of war imprisoned in Dartmoor Prison during the early 19th century. [[Ombre]] is an ancestral form of Euchre.<ref>Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, David Parlett, pg. 124 {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}</ref>\n\nThe game was regarded as the national card game of the United States in the late 19th century{{sfn|Trumps|1864|p=72}} but has declined in popularity, although it retains a strong following in some regions, such as the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wisconsinlife.org/story/wisconsins-passion-euchre |title=Wisconsin's Passion For Euchre |first=Breann |last=Schossow |website=Wisconsin Life |publisher=[[Wisconsin Public Radio]] |date=February 21, 2014 |accessdate=June 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe game retains its popularity in [[Canada]] as well, particularly in [[Ontario]], and is commonly seen as a social game, with community tournaments held in bars or community centres. According to [[David Parlett|Parlett]] it may be described as Canada's national card game.{{sfn|Parlett|1991|p=190}}\n\n==The deal==\nEuchre is a four-player [[Suit (cards)#Trumps|trump]] game, wherein the players are paired to form two partnerships.<ref name =UNO>Tim Ander. How to Play Euchre: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Learning the Euchre Card Game Instructions, Scoring & Strategies to Win at Playing Euchre. 46 pag. (2018). {{ISBN|1976880068}}, {{ISBN|978-1976880063}}</ref> Standard Euchre uses a deck of 24 [[playing card]]s consisting of {{Cards|A}}, {{Cards|K}}, {{Cards|Q}}, {{Cards|J}}, {{Cards|10}}, and {{Cards|9}} of each of the four [[suit (cards)|suits]]. A 52-card deck can be used, omitting the cards from {{Cards|2}} to {{Cards|8}}, or a [[Pinochle]] deck may be divided in half to form two Euchre decks. Sometimes, a 32-card [[Piquet]] or [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] deck is used, which includes the {{Cards|8}}s and {{Cards|7}}s.<ref name =UNO/>\n\nEach player is dealt five cards (seven if using the 32-card deck) in clockwise order in two rounds. A \"cut\" is sometimes offered by the dealer to the player to the right. In some variations, the cut must be requested.\n\nThe remaining four cards are called the \"kitty\" and are placed face down in front of the dealer. The top card of the kitty is turned face up, and bidding begins. The dealer asks each player in turn if they would like the suit of the top card to be trump, which they indicate by saying either \"pick it up\" or \"pass\".<ref name =UNO/> If the choice comes around to the dealer, the dealer can either pick the card up or flip it over. If the dealer acquires the top card (either by being ordered to pick it up or choosing to pick it up), the top card becomes part of the dealer's hand, the dealer then discarding a card to the kitty, face down. If no one orders up the top card and the dealer also chooses not to pick it up, each player is then given the opportunity, in turn, to call a different suit as trump. If no trump is selected, it is a \"misdeal\", and the deal is passed clockwise.\n\nWhen a suit is named trump, the jack in the suit of the same colour becomes a member of this trump suit. Any card of that (expanded) suit outranks any card of a non-trump suit. The highest-ranking card in Euchre is the jack of the trump suit and is called the \"right bower\" or \"right\"; the other jack of the same colour is called the \"left bower\" or \"left\". The cards are ranked, in descending order, {{Cards|J}} (of trump suit), {{Cards|J}} (same colour as trump suit), {{Cards|A}}, {{Cards|K}}, {{Cards|Q}}, {{Cards|10}}, and {{Cards|9}} of the trump suit.<ref name =UNO/> The remaining cards rank in the usual order (the off-colour Jacks are not special) and the cards of those suits ranked, in descending order, {{Cards|A}}, {{Cards|K}}, {{Cards|Q}}, {{Cards|J}}, {{Cards|10}}, and {{Cards|9}}.\n\n===Example===\nAssume a hand is dealt and that Spades are named as trump. In this event, the trump cards are as follows, from highest-ranking to lowest:\n# {{Cards|J|rank_name=full}} of Spades (right bower)\n# {{Cards|J|rank_name=full}} of Clubs (left bower)\n# {{Cards|A|rank_name=full}} of Spades\n# {{Cards|K|rank_name=full}} of Spades\n# {{Cards|Q|rank_name=full}} of Spades\n# {{Cards|10|rank_name=full}} of Spades\n# {{Cards|9|rank_name=full}} of Spades\n\nThe Jack of Clubs becomes a spade during the playing of this hand. This expands the trump suit to the seven cards named above and reduces the suit of the same colour by one card (its jack being loaned to the trump suit). Once the hand is finished, the Jack of Clubs ceases to be a spade and becomes a club again unless spades are again named as trump during the playing of a subsequent hand.\n\n==The play==\n\n===Overview, objective, and scoring===\nWhen naming a suit, a player asserts that their partnership intends to win the majority of tricks of the hand. A single point is scored when the bid succeeds, and two points are scored if the team that declared trump takes all five tricks (called a \"[[march (cards)|march]]\"). A failure of the calling partnership to win three tricks is referred to as being \"euchred\", and that partnership is penalized by giving the opposing partnership two points.<ref name =UNO/>\n\nA caller with exceptionally good cards can \"go alone\", in which case they seek to win the march without a partner. The partner of a caller in a lone hand does not play, and if the caller achieves the march, the winning team scores 4 points. If only three or four of the tricks are taken while going alone, then only one point is scored. If euchred while playing alone, the opposing team still only receives 2 points.\n\nThe primary rule to remember when playing Euchre is that one is never required to play the trump suit (unless that is the one that is led), but one is required to follow suit if possible. (e.g., if diamonds are led, a player with diamonds is required to play a diamond.)\n\n===Calling round (naming trump)===\nOnce the cards are dealt and the top card on the kitty is turned over, the upturned card's suit is offered as trump to the players in clockwise order beginning with the player to the left of the dealer (called the \"eldest\"). Team members are generally discouraged or explicitly forbidden to discuss their preferred choice(s) of trump, covered by the [[Euchre#Table talking|rules forbidding table talk]]. If a player wishes the proposed suit to be named trump, they order up the card and the dealer adds that card to their hand. It is usually more advantageous to the dealer's team to select trump in this way, as the dealer necessarily gains one trump card. The dealer must then also discard a card face down from their hand, in order to return their hand to having a total of five cards. This discard is an important tactical decision, as the dealer can potentially create a \"void\" or \"short suit\" in their hand, where they lack any cards of a particular suit. That would allow them to play a trump card instead of being forced to follow that voided suit when it is led (see the later section on winning tricks, and \"two-suited\" in the Terminology section). If the player instead opts to pass, the option proceeds to the player to the left until either a player orders the card up or all players have passed.<ref>Euchre Explained. Nick Buzzy. 52 pag. ASIN: B004KAB9QU</ref>\n\nIf all players pass, the top card is turned face down and that suit may no longer be chosen as trump. Trump selection proceeds clockwise beginning with the player to the left of the dealer, where the player may name a suit different from that of the previous up-card as trump, or they may pass. No card is ordered up in this round. If all players pass again, it is declared a misdeal. The deal passes to the player on the previous dealer's left, who reshuffles and deals a new hand. (A variation called \"Stick the Dealer\", also referred to as \"hanging\" or \"screwing\" the dealer, is sometimes played, where the dealer is forced to call trump in this situation.)\n\nThe team that selects trump is known as the \"makers\" for the remainder of the hand, and the opposing team is known as the \"defenders\". The makers must take at least three of the five tricks in the hand in order to avoid being euchred.\n\n===Winning tricks===\nThe player to the dealer's left begins play by leading any card of any suit, including trumps. Play continues in clockwise order; each player must follow suit if they have a card of the suit led. The left bower is considered a member of the trump suit and not a member of its native suit.\n\nThe player who played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick, unless a trump is played; then the highest trump card wins the trick. Players who play neither the suit led nor trump cannot win the trick. The player who won the trick collects the played cards from the table, turns the cards face down, and then leads to the next trick.\n\nAfter all five rounds have been played, the hand is scored. The player to the left of the previous dealer then deals the next hand, and the deal moves clockwise around the table until one partnership scores 10 points and wins the game.\n\n===Going alone===\nIf the player bidding and making trump has an exceptionally good hand, that player has the option of playing without their partner and partner's cards. If that player then wins all five tricks, the team scores four points.\n\n\"Going alone\"<ref>Safire's political dictionary, p. 283, William Safire &ndash; Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-19-534334-2}}<br />''American politicians have been either proud of themselves or critical of others for \"going it alone\" since about 1850, when card players began using this phrase to designate a player's decision to take in their tricks without the help of their partner. It may only be called by the person declaring trump, not their partner.''</ref> is initiated at the time the bidder orders the upturned card on the kitty to the dealer or names a suit. The bidder signifies their desire to play alone by saying so after bidding. The bidder must make this call before play begins. During a ''loner'' or lone hand, the bidder's partner discards their cards, and does not participate in play of the hand. In some regional variants (see below), if the dealer's partner \"calls them up\"/\"orders it up\" (on the turned up card), they are obliged to go alone for that hand.\n\nDefending alone: If a player chooses to make trump, the defending team can choose to go alone. If all five tricks are taken by the defending team, the defending team will receive 4 points. In most Canadian variations this is not allowed and only the team making trump may decide to \"go alone\".\n\nThe odds of success of a lone hand depend on the lay of the cards and the inactive cards held by the bidder's partner. Nine cards out of twenty-four do not participate in play, making the hand less predictable than it would be otherwise. A hand consisting of the top five cards of the trump suit is mathematically unbeatable from any position; this is sometimes referred to as a \"lay-down\", as a player with such a hand may often simply lay all five cards on the table at once.\n\n===Scoring===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0 0.5em;\"\n|+ Scoring in euchre\n|-\n!

Some players choose to play \"win by two\" where there is no winner until a team has more than 10 points and 2 points more than the other team. Winning a game 10\u20130 is known as \"skunking\" in the US.\n\n====Scorekeeping markers====\nScores can be kept by using two otherwise unused cards as markers, with each team often using cards of the same colour.\n\nOne method involves using the {{cards|4}} and {{cards|6}} cards. Scoring begins using one card face up, covered by the other card face down. Upon winning points, the top card is moved to reveal the appropriate number of suit symbols on the bottom card. After all points are revealed on the lower card, the top card is flipped over, adding pips on both cards to indicate the score.<ref name =UNO/>\n\nA variation of scorekeeping in Western New York and Ontario involves each side using the {{cards|2}} and {{cards|3}} of one suit. Scoring starts with counting the symbols on the cards, for points 1 to 4; at 5, the cards are turned over and crossed. Crossing the cards indicates 5 points. Points 6 to 9 are counted similarly by counting the number of suit symbols showing and adding them to the 5, when the cards are crossed.\n\nIn Canada and Michigan, it is common for each team to use two {{cards|5}}s of the same colour to keep score, with one team red and the other black. The {{cards|5}}s are usually referred to as \"counting cards\" in this situation.\n\n===Betting===\nBetting takes place after the trump is determined, but before the first card is led to the first trick. Betting can start with an [[ante (poker)|ante]] or forced bet. The defenders can either check on the bid and bid nothing, thereby likely losing their ante; call the bid; or &ndash; if they feel confident that they can Euchre &ndash; raise the bid. Once a bet has been settled by a call on the bid, the hand plays out, with the winners of the bet adding that bet to their pot. After a game has been won, the winning team then splits the pot between the two winners and the game can end. Some variants can be played over multiple games.\n\nBetting in Euchre can also be done on a per-trick basis or a per point basis. At the end of the game, the losing team owes the winning team the difference in points based on the monetary value set per point.\n\n===Table talk===\nCommunicating with one's partner to influence their play, called [[table talk (cards)|table talk]] or cross-boarding, is considered cheating. This can include code words, secret gestures, or other forms of cooperative play. Depending on house rules, table talk can result in replaying of a hand or awarding of a point to the team calling out the infraction.\n\nSome variations allow (or at least accept the inevitability of) the minor non-verbal communication in that a player may hesitate before passing on trump selection to signal to their partner that their cards are helpful to the offered trump, but are not sufficient to guarantee a win.  Conversely, the player may pass quickly or blatantly to indicate their cards are very poor for the available trump choice (possibly indicating their partner should go alone if they select that trump). This adds an additional element of strategy in that players may bluff a quick pass or hesitation to trick their opponents into calling or declining the offered trump; however, this can naturally backfire by confusing the player's own teammate. Depending on the playing group, couples or good friends may be purposely put onto opposing teams, because of the perceived advantage they may have reading one another as teammates.\n\n===Reneging===\nIf a player does not follow suit when they are able to (usually by playing a trump card instead), it is considered a [[renege]] (or revoke), and the opposing team is awarded two points if it is caught in later tricks of the same hand or two points can be deducted from the offending team.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hoyle's rules of games : descriptions of indoor games of skill and chance, with advice on skillful play : based on the foundations laid down by Edmond Hoyle, 1672&ndash;1769|date=2001|publisher=Plume|others=Hoyle, Edmond, 1672&ndash;1769., Morehead, Albert H.

In some variants, reneging when a player or their opponent is going alone may result in a penalty of four points, equally applicable to the maker of trump and the opposing team, in order to equalize the potential values of a hand. Usually, reneging on purpose is considered cheating and is strongly discouraged among communities that consider cheating or lying to be unethical. Players caught repeatedly reneging on purpose are often ostracized from future card playing events.\n\n==Variations==\n{{main|Euchre game variations}}\n[[File:A Game of Auchre.tif|thumb|Shows three men\u2014Jack the black packer, \"Harry my friend\" the digger, and Ah Sin the Chinese [[fossicking|fossicker]]\u2014playing euchre. Ah Sin won.]]\n\nEuchre is a game with a large number of variant versions. They include versions for two to nine players, as well as changes in cards used, bidding, play, and scoring.\n\n'''No trump''': After the first round (once the kitty's top card has been turned down), \"no trump\" may be called. The first card played for each trick establishes that trick's suit,{{clarify|date=March 2020}} with normal deck order (ace high) taking precedence.\n\n'''Stick the dealer''' or '''screw the dealer''': The dealer must call trump at the end of the second round and is unable to declare a misdeal. This variation is often used to keep the game moving quickly.\n\n'''Going under''' or '''bottoms''' or '''farmer's hand''': A player with a hand with at least three {{cards|9}} or {{cards|10}} cards can exchange three of these cards with the three unknown cards in the kitty. This must be performed before trump has been selected.\n\nAnother variant of the \"farmer's hand\" rules states that if a player receives all {{cards|9}}s and {{cards|10}}s, they may call for a redeal. The dealer may not exercise this option (because they pick up the card from the kitty).\n\nIn some variations, a player may not call trump with only a jack and must have another card of the same suit if they wish to call it. Sometimes this only applies to the dealer, and if a player is caught doing this, it is often treated as a renege.\n\n'''Robson rules''': When a team wins all five tricks (normally or by going alone), they may choose to reduce the opposing team's score (by two or four, respectively) instead of adding to their own score. Additionally, if the dealer turns up a jack on the kitty, they may elect to go alone without seeing the rest of their hand. If all tricks are won via this \"blind loner\" hand, five points are awarded instead of the usual four; but a failure to win all tricks earns the defenders one point. This rule set was named for four-time [[Northern Michigan]] regional tournament runner-up champion James Robson.\n\n'''No ace, no face, no trump''': If a player is dealt a hand which once trump is called contains no aces, face cards, or the suit which is trump they may reveal their hand before cards have been played, stating \"no ace, no face, no trump\"; and all players must throw their cards in and the hand is re-dealt.\n\n'''Three-handed Euchre''': A variant for three players, three-handed Euchre is played like 24-card Euchre, with the following changes:\n* Players play alone, rather than in teams.\n* Each player plays to ten points, and keeps their own score (using {{cards|4}}s and {{cards|6}}s as markers)\n* Seven cards are dealt to each player, leaving three in the kitty (top card is turned up).\n* The person who makes trump is the \"maker\". Both other players are \"defenders\", but compete with each other for tricks.\n* If the maker takes four tricks, they receive one point. If the maker takes six tricks, they receive two points. Taking all seven tricks gives the maker four points.\n* If the maker does not take four tricks, they are euchred (set). The defender who took the most tricks will then receive two points. If both defenders took an equal number of tricks, they each receive one point.\n\n'''Ace no face''': If someone is dealt a hand that contains any number of aces but has no face cards, they may lay their cards on the table and call \"ace no face\". This is considered a misdeal, and all the cards are gathered and re-dealt.\n\n'''Queens Mulligan''': If a player has 3 Queens, they can call \"queens mulligan\" when it's their turn to bid, and all the cards are gathered and a new player becomes the dealer.\n\nMany of these variations are specific to a particular region. In Australia and New Zealand, playing to eleven rather than ten points is common. In southwestern England, [[Cornwall]], and [[Guernsey]], variations with a joker as highest trump are played. In [[Ontario]], parts of New Zealand, and in the British and Australian versions of the game, after the dealer turns up the top card on the kitty if the first player to the left passes and the dealer's partner would like to order up the dealer, the dealer's partner must play alone.<ref>[http://falmoutheuchre.orgfree.com/thewayweplay.html An introduction into the way we play Euchre in our league. Penryn, Falmouth & District Euchre League 2014. \"This player will pass or order up the dealer, in the case of the first player passing the second player (dealers Partner) may do like wise, but if they order the dealer they will go alone.\"]</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nEuchre terminology varies greatly from region to region, and is highly colloquial. Some examples include:\n* Bump or getting \"euchred\" or \"set\": Occurs when the opposing team wins more tricks than the team who called the suit.\n* Farmer's Hand, Poor Man's Hand, Bottom Hand, Grandma's Hand: Certain weak hands (usually those containing no {{cards|A|rank_name=full}}s or face cards ({{cards|K|rank_name=full}}s, {{cards|Q|rank_name=full}}s, or {{cards|J|rank_name=full}}s), but only {{cards|9}}s and {{cards|10}}s), are designated as \"farmer's hands\" or \"bottoms\". After inspecting the hand dealt, a player may call out \"farmer's hand\" and is then allowed to show the cards in question and exchange three of them for the three unexposed cards in the kitty (also called \"going under\" or \"under the table\").\n* Ace No Face: Similar to \"farmers hand\". In Ace No Face the player must have one {{cards|A|rank_name=full}} and all {{cards|9}}s and {{cards|10}}s in their hand. The player then calls \"ace no face\" and exchanges three of their cards for the bottom three (must be called before the first card of the beginning trick has been led).\n* Euchre Bustle: Name for a Euchre tournament (used in northern Midwest of United States).\n* Lay-Down: A hand that will automatically win all five tricks if played in the correct order: for example, a Dutchman (both Bowers and the {{cards|A|rank_name=full}} of trumps) plus the {{cards|K|rank_name=full}} and {{cards|Q|rank_name=full}} of that suit, any other two trump cards, or one more trump card and an off-trump {{cards|A|rank_name=full}} (when that player has the lead). It is also called a Loner, or Lone Wolf, because a player with such a hand will typically opt to go alone. It may also refer to any set of cards that are often played when the player knows they will win all the tricks they lay for. This, however, may only be done within the same suit without giving up a slight advantage to the other players.\n* Screw the Dealer, or Stick the Dealer: An optional rule that states that if trump is not called it must be called by the dealer, who is last to act. Mainly used as a method to speed up the game, as it eliminates throw-in hands.\n* Trump the Partner: Refers to a situation where the last player plays the card that wins a trick that their partner would have otherwise won. It usually refers to a situation where the partner has an {{cards|A|rank_name=full}} that follows suit and the player plays a trump card, but playing a higher trump or non-trump than the partner's qualifies.\n* Loner Range: When a team reaches 6 points they are referred to as in \"Loner Range\" because they need 4 or less points (a successful going-alone is worth 4 points) to reach 10 points and win a game. Alternatively, it can also be used to describe being 4 points away from the opposing team. For example, when it is 4 to 8, the losing team is in \"Loner Range\" below the winning team.\n* Throwing in: Because there is no reward for winning four of the five tricks it is often customary for the leading player of the offensive team to throw the remainder of their cards into the centre once three tricks have been assured but five tricks is impossible. This is because one trick has already been won by the opposing team or they are certain that all the tricks cannot be won. (e.g. a right bower was ordered up but has not been played once three tricks have been won) The cards are thrown face up to show the opposing team the inevitability of their winning three tricks or the impossibility of winning all.\n\n==See also==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n* [[500 (card game)|500]]\n* [[Boston (card game)|Boston]]\n* [[Clabber]]\n* [[Dirty clubs]]\n* [[Euchre game variations]]\n* [[Skat (card game)|Skat]]\n* [[Whist]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Matthews, Thomas (1844).
