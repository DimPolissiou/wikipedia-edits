Upon the player's death, the game-within-a-game crashes, and Ash tries to salvage the cartridge by taking it out of the console and blowing on it, with no success. The next day, Ash writes a letter explaining his current situation and the state of the world, stating that there was an [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalypse]], with himself being the only survivor. With his favorite game cartridge broken, Ash sets out into the world to make a friend, and re-populate the world.\n\nThe game is divided into 600+ single-screen interconnected levels, forming 12+ chapters. The objective of the game is to clear the platforming challenges of each screen and proceed to the next, exploring the world and collecting items along the way. Collectable items include tumors, which unlock [[Bonus stage|bonus levels]], and video game cartridges, which unlock [[minigame]]s. The game also features several hidden extras and endings, as well as [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievements]].\n\nIn the \"Best Friend\" ending, Ash creates a friend and has a party with him, saying how he likes his new friend. Ash asks him if he likes him the same way (with a piece of paper and water hitting \"no\"). Then, Ash wakes up to another apocalypse. In the \"Acceptance\" ending, Ash finds his friend, which is stuck to a large glowing orb, and leaves his friend to explode, while he escapes back to his home. When the explosion goes off, he looks outside and smiles. In the \"Nevermore\" ending, Ash becomes part of a \"world\" as he talks.{{clarify|date=October 2017}} On the world, Steven from ''Time Fcuk'' and ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' walking on him.\n\n== Development and release ==\n''The End Is Nigh'' began development as the product of a [[game jam]] in December 2016.

Her parents initially disagree for the marriage but the daughter manages to make them ready for the marriage. They propose Ajay to become their ghar jamai to which he refuses. Preeti's father Bhanu (Danny Dengzongpa) makes Ajay a top class photographer and his salary gets an increment. Later Ajay discovers that Bhanu has made his promotion and this has hurt his self-respect. Preeti and Ajay separate.\n\nAlthough Preeti and Ajay both still love each other, Bhanu makes them have a divorce due to misunderstandings caused by him - Bhanu makes Ajay believe Preeti wants a divorce and vice versa. Preeti is then found to be pregnant with Ajay's child. Bhanu doesn't tell this to Ajay, and instead takes Preeti to the mountains (Shimla) for the delivery so that nobody finds that she gave birth to a baby. There in the hospital, Bhanu meets Ajay and tells him about the baby. Bhanu agrees to give the baby to Ajay on the basis that Ajay never approach Preeti again, as she wants a new life with a new man. Ajay agrees, but Bhanu later changes his mind and gives the baby to an orphanage. However, Ajay follows him there and takes his own baby from the orphanage.\n\nThe story moves forward for some years and Preeti doesn't believe that her baby is dead, slowly losing her mental stability as a result. She carries a doll child in her arms, believing it to be her own son. Her parents get increasingly worried as a result. However, Preeti shows some improvement when she sees a photograph which she clicked in Shimla when she was with Ajay. The parents take her back to Shimla as a result. Ajay lives in Shimla and has brought up his child on his own. In a chance occurrence, the child meets Preeti and there is a connection between the two \u2013 with the help of Ajay, he later identifies her as his mother. He returns to her and brings her to Ajay and they solve their misunderstandings. The two expose the misunderstandings in their minds caused by Bhanu. They are able to reconcile and express their love for one another and live happily thereafter with their child.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Mithun Chakraborty]] as Ajay Khanna\n* [[Padmini Kolhapure]] as Preeti Pratap / Preeti Khanna\n* [[Danny Denzongpa]] as Bhanu Pratap\n* [[Bindu (actress)|Bindu]] as Kamini Pratap\n* Master Vicky as Vicky Khanna\n* [[Madhu Malini]] as Mala Mathur\n* [[Sudha Chopra]] as Kamini's sister\n* [[Vikas Anand]] as Police Inspector\n* [[Pinchoo Kapoor]] as Dwarka Prasad\n* [[Manmohan Krishna]] as Mr. Mathur\n* [[Roopesh Kumar]] as Rohit Prasad\n* [[Chaman Puri]] as Shankar\n* [[Asrani]] as Jackie\n* [[Ratna Bhushan]]\n\n'''Awards and Nominations'''\n\n'''[[33rd Filmfare Awards]]<ref>[[33rd Filmfare Awards]]</ref><ref>http://deep750.googlepages.com/FilmfareAwards.pdf</ref>\n\n'''[[Filmfare Award for Best Actress]]'''- [[Padmini Kolhapure]] Nominated\n\n'''[[Filmfare Award for Best Music Direction]]'''- [[Laxmikant Pyarelal]] Nominated\n\n'''[[Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer]]'''- [[Shabbir Kumar]] for [[Tumse Milkar Na Jaane]] Nominated\n\n'''[[Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer]]'''- [[Kavita Krishnamurthy]] for [[Tumse Milkar Na Jaane]] Nominated\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{| border=\"10\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n! # !!

{"title_page": "Monteverdi High Speed", "text_new": "{{Expand German|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe '''Monteverdi High Speed''' is a series of sports cars with different bodies produced from 1967-1976 by Swiss automaker [[Monteverdi (automobile)|Monteverdi]]. The High Speed series included several coupe models, a convertible and a sedan. In addition, the Coup\u00e9 Berlinetta and the Cabriolet [[Monteverdi Palm Beach|Palm Beach]] also belong to the model family.{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Monteverdi 375L HS top.jpg\n| caption = Monteverdi 375 L with body by [[Carrozzeria Fissore]]\n| name = Monteverdi High Speed\n| manufacturer = [[Monteverdi (car)|Monteverdi]]\n| aka = Monteverdi High Speed 375\n| production = 1967\u20131976\n| designer = \n| class = [[Grand tourer]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]<br />2-door [[convertible]]<br />4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| engine = Chrysler 7.2&nbsp;L Magnum 440 [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>Chrysler 7.0 L [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| related = [[Monteverdi Palm Beach]]\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| assembly = [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]\n}}\n\n== Conception ==\nIn most cases, the Monteverdi models of the high-speed series are technically described as uncomplicated.<ref>Motor Klassik, Heft 11/1997</ref> They were based on a box frame of square tubes. The design of the frame was Monteverdi's own; The rack was manufactured by Stahlbau AG in Muttenz in the canton of Basel-Landschaft, which according to some information at least temporarily belonged to Monteverdi. The engine was regularly a V8 engine from Chrysler, whose output was supposed to be 280&nbsp;kW (375&nbsp;hp). This explains the number following the vehicle name. However, when this peak power was actually achieved, it was SAE standard; the corresponding DIN values were about 35% lower. On the other hand, Chrysler's big-block engines, especially those made by Chrysler's Mopar components, could deliver far greater horsepower without major problems.\n\n== Variants ==\nBetween 1967 and 1976 Monteverdi presented a variety of variants of its High Speed model. All of these models have been uniformly designated by the factory as High Speed 375; they each received name additions for coupes on standard wheelbase, short coupes, convertibles and sedans.\n\nIn general, two series can be distinguished. The first series, produced from 1967 to 1968, included a handful of coupes, designed by [[Pietro Frua]] in Turin, whose bodywork was built in the Frua factory. The second, much larger series debuted in the summer of 1968 and ended in 1976. These are vehicles that were largely (but not exclusively) built at the [[Carrozzeria Fissore]] in Savigliano. The first vehicles built by [[Carrozzeria Fissore]] still had a body in Frua design; from 1969 there was an independent Fissore body, from which various modifications were derived.\n\n=== The Frua models ===\n\n==== High Speed 375 S (Frua) ====\nThe first model, the High Speed 375 S, was a two-seater coupe with a body designed by [[Pietro Frua]] in Turin. Some details were found on the Monteverdi that took up features of Frua's earlier work. Notably the Maserati Mistral and the British AC 428 had obvious similarities. Some sources claim that the similarities go so far that individual components of these cars, such as glass sections and doors, are interchangeable.<ref>Bachelor, Poole, Robson: Das gro\u00dfe Buch der Sportwagen, S. 20 (im Beitrag zum AC 428)</ref>\n[[File:Monteverdi-High Speed-375-S-Frua.jpg|thumb|Monteverdi High Speed 375 S with Fissore body (prototype from 1967).]]\nThe High Speed 375 S with a Frua body was presented in September 1967 at the 43rd IAA at the booth of the company Auto Becker and received very positive reviews. For example, Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung Blick saw it as \"the most beautiful shapes ever seen between the Alps and the English Channel\".<ref>zitiert nach Oleski/Lehbrink: Seriensportwagen, S. 332</ref> In addition to the elegant bodywork and solid handling, the luxurious and well-finished interior was particularly well received. As late as 1967, regular production started, which was designed to be work-sharing. At first, the workers in Monteverdi's Binninger workshop provided the chassis with motor and drive technology. The roadworthy chassis was then delivered to Turin, where Frua put on the body and completed the car. The ready-to-drive vehicle was then returned to Monteverdi.\n\nIn this way, in the first six months of cooperation between Monteverdi and Frua, a total of twelve coup\u00e9s were produced.\n\n==== High Speed 375 L ====\nAlongside the regular two-seater coupe, Frua developed on behalf of Monteverdi an extended version, which was designed as a 2+2-seater. The sideline and the roof section had been significantly changed. The prototype was shown in public in 1968, but afterwards remained at Monteverdi in the factory. The 2 + 2-seater did not go on sale.\n\n==== High Speed 400 ====\nCoinciding with the 375 S, Monteverdi announced [10] the production of an even more powerful model with a 7.0-liter eight-cylinder from Chrysler, which was to provide 294&nbsp;kW (400&nbsp;hp). The car never materialized and such a model with a Frua body was never produced.\n\n==== The end of the collaboration with Frua ====\nIn the spring of 1968, [[Peter Monteverdi]] considered a significant increase in annual output; Around 100 vehicles were planned per year. These numbers did not match the capacity of Atelier Frua, whose bodies were purely hand built, and who had no capacity to build such high numbers of vehicles. Frua then suggested outsourcing the production to [[Maggiora (manufacturer)|Carrozzeria Maggiora]], where some Maserati models were  already built and capacities for a partially automated production existed. But Monteverdi rejected this step, because it was associated with high investments, especially for pressing tools. Instead, he was looking for another body shop that could do the purely manual production of the desired quantities. This he found in [[Carrozzeria Fissore]] in Savigliano near Milan, a smaller and less prestigious design studio of the northern Italian level, which in the 1960s designed the [[De Tomaso Vallelunga]] and some [[DKW]] models for the South American market.\n\nFrom the summer of 1968 Monteverdi had a total of about ten bodies of Pietro Frua's design, produced at [[Carrozzeria Fissore]]. At the same time Peter Monteverdi denied the payment of royalties to Frua, whereupon this Monteverdi had the use of his design prohibited by court order. Monteverdi then had to design a new body, which was available in 1969. Until then, Monteverdi could not sell off all the bodies built by Fissore in Frua style; The last of these rare models were sold off in 1973.\n\nPietro Frua used the basic features of the Monteverdi 375 in a modified form also in later other designs. So in 1971 he designed a fastback coupe based on the Dodge Challenger , which repeated many features of the 375. The Challenger Coupe still exists today and is regularly shown at European exhibitions.\n\n=== The Fissore Models ===\nFor 1969 Monteverdi had to put as a consequence of the lawsuit with Frua a new body for his coupe on the legs. On the occasion of this new beginning, Monteverdi changed his concept. Unlike before, the pure two-seater should not be the volume model; Rather, various inquiries from prospective buyers had revealed that a 2 + 2 coupe on extended chassis was preferred. Accordingly, the High Speed 375 L should be the base vehicle of the Monteverdi range. In the next eight years, the bodies were to be produced predominantly, but not exclusively, at Fissore in Savigliano.\n\n====Monteverdi 2000 GTI====\nThe 2000 GTI was designed as a cheaper alternative to the High Speed GT cars, and created as a study project it employed BMW components and was powered by a four-cylinder, 130 DIN horsepower engine. In order to maintain the exclusivity of the high speed series, Peter Monteverdi decided not to build the lower priced, smaller GT coupe.<ref>http://www.monteverdi.ch/en_sportscars.html</ref>\n\n==== High Speed 375 L ====\nThe High Speed 375 L with Fissore body was to become the volume model of the Monteverdi product range. The new body in its proportions corresponded exactly to the Frua model, but featured an angular design at the front and rear. The front end showed strong chrome-framed double round headlights, which were later replaced by rectangular broadband headlights in a few cases. At the rear, tail lights from the [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]] Berlina were used. Who was the designer of this model is unclear. [[Peter Monteverdi]] claimed to have designed the body itself,<ref>Ausdr\u00fccklich beispielsweise in seinem Verkaufsprospekt von 1972</ref> Fissore never denied it to him. It is likely that Fissore worked out the details according to Monteverdi sketches and Monteverdi relinquished the rights to the design, as if in return for the production order.\n[[File:Monteverdi High Speed 375L-1.jpg|thumb|High Speed 375 L]]\nPeter Monteverdi highlighted in a sales brochure <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/others1/72mont/72mont.html|title=Hot cars|website=www.lov2xlr8.no|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref> from 1972, the style of the vehicle and the outstanding performance. In it he described the Monteverdi High Speed 375 L as \"the Coup\u00e9 of today with the technology of tomorrow\".\n\nThe German magazine Auto Motor und sport tested a high-speed 375 L with a 7.2-liter engine in spring, 1972 and determined the following performance:\n\nTop speed: 229.3&nbsp;km/h (142.5&nbsp;mph)\n\n0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0-62&nbsp;mph): 8.2 seconds\n\n1&nbsp;km with standing start: 28.3 seconds.\n\nThus, the Monteverdi was about at the level of the British [[Jensen Interceptor]], but did not match the performance of cars such as the [[Aston Martin V8]] or the [[Maserati Indy]].\n\nDuring the production period, minor or major improvements or changes were made to the series. The most striking of these was probably the complete redesign of the dashboard with the vintage 1972/73. Until then, with a lot of wood and classical instruments, it was more like traditional English chic, but now the Monteverdis presented themselves in a sportier style in a black velour design. Since the entire High Speed series originated in handcrafted one-off production, it can not be ruled out that Monteverdi was also directed at individual detail designs to individual customer requirements.\n\n==== High Speed 375 S ====\nAlongside the 2 + 2-seater Monteverdi reactivated his initially presented short chassis for another pure two-seater. This car received a bodywork that was significantly changed, with recessed headlamps and six round taillights. The two-seater with Fissore body was much less successful than the 2 + 2-seater type 375 L. Between 1969 and 1971, a total of six short coupes were made with Fissore bodies. One of them belongs today to the extensive car collection of the American talk show host [[Jay Leno]].\n\nIn the winter of 1971/72, the 375 S was further developed into the Monteverdi Berlinetta. The tubular frame has been reinforced for improved torsional resistance; The car received a new front end with a narrow, over the entire width of the car radiator grille. Monteverdi emphasized the increased passive safety of the Berlinetta.\n\n==== High Speed 375 C ====\n[[File:1971 Monteverdi 375C.jpg|thumb|The only surviving High Speed 375 C]]\nFrom the short chassis 375 S Monteverdi derived in 1971, a convertible version called the 375 C. Unlike the 375 S, the convertible did not carry six round taillights, instead, like the 375 L, using tail lights from the [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]].\n\nThe initially painted yellow 375 C was presented to the public at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1971|1971 Geneva Motor Show]]. The purchase price was given there at 75,750 Swiss francs. Overall, only two copies were made. One was sold to a client, while the second copy remained at the factory and was converted in 1974 using body parts of the Monteverdi Berlinetta to the convertible [[Monteverdi Palm Beach]]. Later, Monteverdi bought back the 375 C; The car is now in Monteverdi's Automobile Museum and occasionally shown at exhibitions.<ref>Lewandowski/Zellner, Kult-Cabrios, S. 80</ref>\n\n==== High Speed 375/4 ====\nThe culmination of the high-speed series was a large four-door sedan called the 375/4 .\n[[File:Monteverdi 1972 vorne schr\u00e4g.JPG|thumb|High Speed 375/4]]\nThe wheelbase of the vehicle was extended to 3.15 meters, the technical key data - especially the drive technology - remained unchanged. With a consistent front end joined from the A-pillar four wide-opening doors (with door handles from the [[Fiat 128]]), a sharply drawn roof section and an extended trunk, the top of the belt line continued straight. The interior was covered with leather, air conditioning, power windows and on request a Sony TV; the car could be used without restrictions as a chauffeured limousine. Individual copies were accordingly delivered with a partition between driver and passenger compartment. External details were repeatedly object of change, sometimes Monteverdi also followed the customer request. For example, a late model was delivered with two rectangular headlamps borrowed from the [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]], a matte black radiator grille and rubber-covered bumpers. In addition, after initially the already known from the 375 L tail lights of the [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]] were installed in the last models, tail lights from the [[Triumph TR6]] were used, which had previously been seen on Monteverdi's Berlinetta, and gave the sedan a more modern appearance.\n\n== Literature ==\n\n=== Newspapers and Magazines ===\n\n* Automobil Revue, Katalognummern 1968, 1969 und 1973 (technische Daten)\n* auto motor und sport: Alpentraum, Test eines Monteverdi High speed 375 L in der Ausgabe 12/1972 vom 10.

The High Speed series included several coupe models, a convertible and a sedan. In addition, the Coup\u00e9 Berlinetta and the Cabriolet [[Monteverdi Palm Beach|Palm Beach]] also belong to the model family.{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Monteverdi 375L HS top.jpg\n| caption = Monteverdi 375 L with body by [[Carrozzeria Fissore]]\n| name = Monteverdi High Speed\n| manufacturer = [[Monteverdi (car)|Monteverdi]]\n| aka = Monteverdi High Speed 375\n| production = 1967\u20131976\n| designer = \n| class = [[Grand tourer]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]<br />2-door [[convertible]]<br />4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| engine = Chrysler 7.2&nbsp;L Magnum 440 [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>Chrysler 7.0 L [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| related = [[Monteverdi Palm Beach]]\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| assembly = [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]\n}}\n\n== Conception ==\nIn most cases, the Monteverdi models of the high-speed series are technically described as uncomplicated.<ref>Motor Klassik, Heft 11/1997</ref> They were based on a box frame of square tubes. The design of the frame was Monteverdi's own; The rack was manufactured by Stahlbau AG in Muttenz in the canton of Basel-Landschaft, which according to some information at least temporarily belonged to Monteverdi. The engine was regularly a V8 engine from Chrysler, whose output was supposed to be 280&nbsp;kW (375&nbsp;hp). This explains the number following the vehicle name. However, when this peak power was actually achieved, it was SAE standard; the corresponding DIN values were about 35% lower. On the other hand, Chrysler's big-block engines, especially those made by Chrysler's Mopar components, could deliver far greater horsepower without major problems.\n\n== Variants ==\nBetween 1967 and 1976 Monteverdi presented a variety of variants of its High Speed model. All of these models have been uniformly designated by the factory as High Speed 375; they each received name additions for coupes on standard wheelbase, short coupes, convertibles and sedans.\n\nIn general, two series can be distinguished. The first series, produced from 1967 to 1968, included a handful of coupes, designed by [[Pietro Frua]] in Turin, whose bodywork was built in the Frua factory. The second, much larger series debuted in the summer of 1968 and ended in 1976. These are vehicles that were largely (but not exclusively) built at the [[Carrozzeria Fissore]] in Savigliano. The first vehicles built by [[Carrozzeria Fissore]] still had a body in Frua design; from 1969 there was an independent Fissore body, from which various modifications were derived.\n\n=== The Frua models ===\n\n==== High Speed 375 S (Frua) ====\nThe first model, the High Speed 375 S, was a two-seater coupe with a body designed by [[Pietro Frua]] in Turin. Some details were found on the Monteverdi that took up features of Frua's earlier work. Notably the Maserati Mistral and the British AC 428 had obvious similarities. Some sources claim that the similarities go so far that individual components of these cars, such as glass sections and doors, are interchangeable.<ref>Bachelor, Poole, Robson: Das gro\u00dfe Buch der Sportwagen, S. 20 (im Beitrag zum AC 428)</ref>\n[[File:Monteverdi-High Speed-375-S-Frua.jpg|thumb|Monteverdi High Speed 375 S with Fissore body (prototype from 1967).]]\nThe High Speed 375 S with a Frua body was presented in September 1967 at the 43rd IAA at the booth of the company Auto Becker and received very positive reviews. For example, Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung Blick saw it as \"the most beautiful shapes ever seen between the Alps and the English Channel\".<ref>zitiert nach Oleski/Lehbrink: Seriensportwagen, S. 332</ref> In addition to the elegant bodywork and solid handling, the luxurious and well-finished interior was particularly well received. As late as 1967, regular production started, which was designed to be work-sharing. At first, the workers in Monteverdi's Binninger workshop provided the chassis with motor and drive technology. The roadworthy chassis was then delivered to Turin, where Frua put on the body and completed the car. The ready-to-drive vehicle was then returned to Monteverdi.\n\nIn this way, in the first six months of cooperation between Monteverdi and Frua, a total of twelve coup\u00e9s were produced.\n\n==== High Speed 375 L ====\nAlongside the regular two-seater coupe, Frua developed on behalf of Monteverdi an extended version, which was designed as a 2+2-seater. The sideline and the roof section had been significantly changed. The prototype was shown in public in 1968, but afterwards remained at Monteverdi in the factory. The 2 + 2-seater did not go on sale.\n\n==== High Speed 400 ====\nCoinciding with the 375 S, Monteverdi announced [10] the production of an even more powerful model with a 7.0-liter eight-cylinder from Chrysler, which was to provide 294&nbsp;kW (400&nbsp;hp). The car never materialized and such a model with a Frua body was never produced.\n\n==== The end of the collaboration with Frua ====\nIn the spring of 1968, [[Peter Monteverdi]] considered a significant increase in annual output; Around 100 vehicles were planned per year. These numbers did not match the capacity of Atelier Frua, whose bodies were purely hand built, and who had no capacity to build such high numbers of vehicles. Frua then suggested outsourcing the production to [[Maggiora (manufacturer)|Carrozzeria Maggiora]], where some Maserati models were  already built and capacities for a partially automated production existed. But Monteverdi rejected this step, because it was associated with high investments, especially for pressing tools. Instead, he was looking for another body shop that could do the purely manual production of the desired quantities. This he found in [[Carrozzeria Fissore]] in Savigliano near Milan, a smaller and less prestigious design studio of the northern Italian level, which in the 1960s designed the [[De Tomaso Vallelunga]] and some [[DKW]] models for the South American market.\n\nFrom the summer of 1968 Monteverdi had a total of about ten bodies of Pietro Frua's design, produced at [[Carrozzeria Fissore]]. At the same time Peter Monteverdi denied the payment of royalties to Frua, whereupon this Monteverdi had the use of his design prohibited by court order. Monteverdi then had to design a new body, which was available in 1969. Until then, Monteverdi could not sell off all the bodies built by Fissore in Frua style; The last of these rare models were sold off in 1973.\n\nPietro Frua used the basic features of the Monteverdi 375 in a modified form also in later other designs. So in 1971 he designed a fastback coupe based on the Dodge Challenger , which repeated many features of the 375. The Challenger Coupe still exists today and is regularly shown at European exhibitions.\n\n=== The Fissore Models ===\nFor 1969 Monteverdi had to put as a consequence of the lawsuit with Frua a new body for his coupe on the legs. On the occasion of this new beginning, Monteverdi changed his concept. Unlike before, the pure two-seater should not be the volume model; Rather, various inquiries from prospective buyers had revealed that a 2 + 2 coupe on extended chassis was preferred. Accordingly, the High Speed 375 L should be the base vehicle of the Monteverdi range. In the next eight years, the bodies were to be produced predominantly, but not exclusively, at Fissore in Savigliano.\n\n====Monteverdi 2000 GTI====\nThe 2000 GTI was designed as a cheaper alternative to the High Speed GT cars, and created as a study project it employed BMW components and was powered by a four-cylinder, 130 DIN horsepower engine. In order to maintain the exclusivity of the high speed series, Peter Monteverdi decided not to build the lower priced, smaller GT coupe.<ref>http://www.monteverdi.ch/en_sportscars.html</ref>\n\n==== High Speed 375 L ====\nThe High Speed 375 L with Fissore body was to become the volume model of the Monteverdi product range. The new body in its proportions corresponded exactly to the Frua model, but featured an angular design at the front and rear. The front end showed strong chrome-framed double round headlights, which were later replaced by rectangular broadband headlights in a few cases. At the rear, tail lights from the [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]] Berlina were used. Who was the designer of this model is unclear. [[Peter Monteverdi]] claimed to have designed the body itself,<ref>Ausdr\u00fccklich beispielsweise in seinem Verkaufsprospekt von 1972</ref> Fissore never denied it to him. It is likely that Fissore worked out the details according to Monteverdi sketches and Monteverdi relinquished the rights to the design, as if in return for the production order.\n[[File:Monteverdi High Speed 375L-1.jpg|thumb|High Speed 375 L]]\nPeter Monteverdi highlighted in a sales brochure <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/others1/72mont/72mont.html|title=Hot cars|website=www.lov2xlr8.no|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref> from 1972, the style of the vehicle and the outstanding performance. In it he described the Monteverdi High Speed 375 L as \"the Coup\u00e9 of today with the technology of tomorrow\".\n\nThe German magazine Auto Motor und sport tested a high-speed 375 L with a 7.2-liter engine in spring, 1972 and determined the following performance:\n\nTop speed: 229.3&nbsp;km/h (142.5&nbsp;mph)\n\n0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0-62&nbsp;mph): 8.2 seconds\n\n1&nbsp;km with standing start: 28.3 seconds.\n\nThus, the Monteverdi was about at the level of the British [[Jensen Interceptor]], but did not match the performance of cars such as the [[Aston Martin V8]] or the [[Maserati Indy]].\n\nDuring the production period, minor or major improvements or changes were made to the series. The most striking of these was probably the complete redesign of the dashboard with the vintage 1972/73. Until then, with a lot of wood and classical instruments, it was more like traditional English chic, but now the Monteverdis presented themselves in a sportier style in a black velour design. Since the entire High Speed series originated in handcrafted one-off production, it can not be ruled out that Monteverdi was also directed at individual detail designs to individual customer requirements.\n\n==== High Speed 375 S ====\nAlongside the 2 + 2-seater Monteverdi reactivated his initially presented short chassis for another pure two-seater. This car received a bodywork that was significantly changed, with recessed headlamps and six round taillights. The two-seater with Fissore body was much less successful than the 2 + 2-seater type 375 L. Between 1969 and 1971, a total of six short coupes were made with Fissore bodies. One of them belongs today to the extensive car collection of the American talk show host [[Jay Leno]].\n\nIn the winter of 1971/72, the 375 S was further developed into the Monteverdi Berlinetta. The tubular frame has been reinforced for improved torsional resistance; The car received a new front end with a narrow, over the entire width of the car radiator grille. Monteverdi emphasized the increased passive safety of the Berlinetta.\n\n==== High Speed 375 C ====\n[[File:1971 Monteverdi 375C.jpg|thumb|The only surviving High Speed 375 C]]\nFrom the short chassis 375 S Monteverdi derived in 1971, a convertible version called the 375 C. Unlike the 375 S, the convertible did not carry six round taillights, instead, like the 375 L, using tail lights from the [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]].\n\nThe initially painted yellow 375 C was presented to the public at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1971|1971 Geneva Motor Show]]. The purchase price was given there at 75,750 Swiss francs. Overall, only two copies were made. One was sold to a client, while the second copy remained at the factory and was converted in 1974 using body parts of the Monteverdi Berlinetta to the convertible [[Monteverdi Palm Beach]]. Later, Monteverdi bought back the 375 C; The car is now in Monteverdi's Automobile Museum and occasionally shown at exhibitions.<ref>Lewandowski/Zellner, Kult-Cabrios, S. 80</ref>\n\n==== High Speed 375/4 ====\nThe culmination of the high-speed series was a large four-door sedan called the 375/4 .\n[[File:Monteverdi 1972 vorne schr\u00e4g.JPG|thumb|High Speed 375/4]]\nThe wheelbase of the vehicle was extended to 3.15 meters, the technical key data - especially the drive technology - remained unchanged. With a consistent front end joined from the A-pillar four wide-opening doors (with door handles from the [[Fiat 128]]), a sharply drawn roof section and an extended trunk, the top of the belt line continued straight. The interior was covered with leather, air conditioning, power windows and on request a Sony TV; the car could be used without restrictions as a chauffeured limousine. Individual copies were accordingly delivered with a partition between driver and passenger compartment. External details were repeatedly object of change, sometimes Monteverdi also followed the customer request. For example, a late model was delivered with two rectangular headlamps borrowed from the [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]], a matte black radiator grille and rubber-covered bumpers. In addition, after initially the already known from the 375 L tail lights of the [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]] were installed in the last models, tail lights from the [[Triumph TR6]] were used, which had previously been seen on Monteverdi's Berlinetta, and gave the sedan a more modern appearance.\n\n== Literature ==\n\n=== Newspapers and Magazines ===\n\n* Automobil Revue, Katalognummern 1968, 1969 und 1973 (technische Daten)\n* auto motor und sport: Alpentraum, Test eines Monteverdi High speed 375 L in der Ausgabe 12/1972 vom 10.

Teimuraz was also a [[Lyric poetry|lyric poet]].\n\n== Life ==\n\nHe was a son of [[Erekle I]] and his wife Anna. Together with his mother, Teimuraz ruled as regent for his absent brother [[David II of Kakheti|David II]] (Imam Quli-Khan) from 1709 to 1715. In 1732, the Turks killed the next king and Teimuraz\u2019s other brother, [[Constantine II of Kakheti|Constantine]], and took control of his kingdom. His successor, Teimuraz, fled to the mountains of [[Pshavi]] and fought the occupants from there. In July 1735, the resurgent [[Persia]]n ruler [[Nader Shah Afshar]] invaded [[Kakheti]] and forced the Turks out of most of eastern Georgia. Nader summoned Teimuraz to his headquarters at [[Erivan]] and, upon his refusal to convert to Islam, had him detained. Kakheti was placed under the nominal government of Teimuraz's Muslim nephew [[Ali Mirza of Kakheti|Ali Mirza]]. In October 1735, Teimuraz escaped to the mountains of Kakheti and fomented unrest against the Persian rule, but he was captured by the close of 1736.\n\nDuring these years, part of Georgian nobles staged a powerful rebellion against the Persian regime. In 1738, the shah had to release Teimuraz to counter the Georgian opposition, and made him governor of Kakheti, while his son [[Erekle II]] campaigned with Nader [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|in India]].{{sfn|Suny|1994|page=55}}{{sfn|Hitchins|1998|pages=541-542}} The uprising now turned into a brutal civil war between pro- and anti-Persian factions. Teimuraz, aided by his son Erekle II, was able to crush the rebels led by [[Givi Amilakhvari]]. As a reward, the shah abolished, in 1742, a heavy tribute laid upon Kakheti, and helped Teimuraz to subdue autonomous duchies of the [[Aragvi]] and the [[Ksani]] in 1743 and 1744 respectively. For his service against the [[Ottoman Turkey|Ottomans]] and an anti-Persian revolt, in 1744, Teimuraz was confirmed by the shah as king of [[Kartli]], and his son Erekle was given a Kakhetian crown, thus laying the ground for the eventual reunification of these Georgian kingdoms. Most importantly, they were recognised as [[Christianity|Christian]] kings for the first time since 1632. Both monarchs were crowned at the Cathedral of the Living Pillar ([[Svetitskhoveli]]) at [[Mtskheta]] on October 1, 1745.\n\nWith their power growing increasingly stronger, Teimuraz and Erekle soon repudiated their allegiance to the Persian suzerain. Nader Shah ordered 30,000 Persian troops to move into Georgia and entrusted a Georgian convert (and a former anti-Persian leader) Amilakhvari with the punitive operation. The shah was, however, murdered in 1747, and his empire became engulf into complete chaos. The rulers of Kartli and Kakheti took advantage of the situation and expelled all Persian garrisons from their kingdoms. From 1749 to 1750, they checked several attempts of Persian pretenders to create their powerbase in the eastern [[Transcaucasia]], and made the neighbouring [[Khan (title)|khanates]] of [[Yerevan]], [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], and [[Nakhichevan Khanate|Nakhichevan]] their tributaries. He fought then against the [[Dagestan]]i clansmen who frequently [[Lekianoba|raided]] the Georgian marchlands, but without complete success.\n\nLike several previous Georgian rulers, he hoped that the expanding [[Russian empire]] would be the only protector for the Christians of [[Caucasus]] against the Ottoman and Persian aggressions. He sent an embassy to [[St Petersburg]] in 1752, but nothing came of this mission. In 1760, he visited the Russian court himself to gain a support for his project of a Georgian expedition to Persia to put a Russian candidate on the shah\u2019s throne. The Russians were too preoccupied with the [[Seven Years' War]] to seriously consider Teimuraz\u2019s idea. He died suddenly in the Russian capital on January 8, 1762 (just a fortnight after [[Elizabeth of Russia]] incidentally), and was buried next to his father-in-law [[Vakhtang VI]] in the Cathedral of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], [[Astrakhan]]. On his death, Erekle succeeded as king of Kartli, bringing both eastern Georgian kingdoms into a single state ([[Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti]])\n\nAlthough he was constantly at war or on guard, Teimuraz found some time to translate from Persian and compose, virtually on horseback, his own poems and lyrics.\n\n==Reburial==\n[[File:Teimuraz II tomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of King Teimuraz II in Astrakhan.]]\nIn July 2013, Georgia raised the possibility to move Teimuraz's remains to Georgia for reburial.<ref>[http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=10633 Georgian patriarch to arrive in Moscow]. Retrieved 2013-08-02.</ref>\n\n== Family ==\n\nTeimuraz was married thrice. He divorced his first wife, a daughter of Duke Baadur of the Aragvi, probably called Tamar, in 1711. Two years later, on February 2, 1712, he remarried Vakhtang VI's daughter [[Tamar of Kartli|Tamar]] (born 1696), who died on April 12, 1746. The same year, on August 19, Teimuraz married his third wife, Ana-Khanum (1716 \u2014 March 1788), daughter of Prince Bejan Palavankhosroshvili-Baratashvili, and former wife of Prince Kaikhosro Tsitsishvili. He had two sons and four daughters by his second and third marriages.\n\nTeimuraz's children of his marriage to Tamar of Kartli were:\n\n* [[Heraclius II of Georgia|Heraclius II]] (November 7, 1720 \u2013 January 11, 1798), the future king of Kakheti and of Kartli and Kakheti.\n* Princess [[Princess Ketevan of Kakheti|Ketevan]], who married, in 1737 at [[Mashhad]] [[Adil Shah]] of Iran (1719\u20131749).\n* Princess Elene (fl. 1743\u20131784), who married, c. 1743, Prince Zaza [[Tsitsishvili]].\n* Princess Ana  (1720 \u2013 December 4, 1788), who married firstly, in 1744, Prince Dimitri [[Orbeliani]] (died 1776) and secondly Prince Ioane Orbeliani (c. 1702 \u2013 1781).\n\nTeimuraz's union with Ana-Khanum Baratashvili produced:\n* Prince Solomon (May 24, 1747 \u2013 July 28, 1749).\n* Princess Elisabed (March 25, 1750 \u2013 May 8, 1770), who was betrothed to Prince Giorgi [[Amilakhvari]] in 1762, but the marriage was disrupted for political reasons in 1765 and Elisabed was given in marriage, on November 16, 1765, to [[Katsia II Dadiani]], [[Principality of Mingrelia|Prince of Mingrelia]] (died 1788).\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Teimuraz II of Kakheti}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources ==\n* {{cite encyclopedia | article = EREKLE II | last = Hitchins | first = Keith | authorlink = | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/erekle-ii | editor-last = | editor-first = | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. VIII, Fasc. 5 | pages = 541\u2013542 | location = | publisher = | year = 1998 | isbn = |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Suny|first1=Ronald Grigor|authorlink1=Ronald Grigor Suny|title=The Making of the Georgian Nation|date=1994|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253209153|ref=harv}}\n*{{in lang|en}} [http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Georgia/kakhet3.htm The Royal Ark]\n*{{in lang|en}} [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/georgia-ii-history- Iranian-Georgian Relations in the 16th- 19th Centuries] in [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica]]\n*[[Donald Rayfield]], ''[[The Literature of Georgia: A History]]'' (August 16, 2000), Routledge, {{ISBN|0-7007-1163-5}}, page 126-7 (about Teimuraz\u2019s poetry)\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Constantine II of Kakheti|Constantine II]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of the Kings of Georgia|King of Kakheti]]|years=1732\u20131744}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Heraclius II of Georgia|Heraclius II]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=Persian rule}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of the Kings of Georgia|King of Kartli]]|years=1744\u20131762}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Heraclius II of Georgia|Heraclius II]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Triarchy in Georgia}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Teimuraz 02}}\n[[Category:Kings of Georgia]]\n[[Category:Kings of Kakheti]]\n[[Category:Former Muslims from Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Converts to Eastern Orthodoxy from Shia Islam]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox monarchs]]\n[[Category:Bagrationi dynasty of the Kingdom of Kakheti]]\n[[Category:18th-century poets from Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Safavid governors of Kakheti]]\n[[Category:Afsharid governors of Kakheti]]\n[[Category:1680 births]]\n[[Category:1762 deaths]]\n[[Category:Male poets from Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Afsharid appointed kings of Kartli]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox royalty\n| name            = Teimuraz II\n| full name       =\n| title           = \n| othertitles     = [[List of the Kings of Georgia|King of Kartli]]\n| image           = Vinogradov.

Teimuraz was also a [[Lyric poetry|lyric poet]].\n\n== Life ==\n\nHe was a son of [[Erekle I]] and his wife Anna. Together with his mother, Teimuraz ruled as regent for his absent brother [[David II of Kakheti|David II]] (Imam Quli-Khan) from 1709 to 1715. In 1732, the Turks killed the next king and Teimuraz\u2019s other brother, [[Constantine II of Kakheti|Constantine]], and took control of his kingdom. His successor, Teimuraz, fled to the mountains of [[Pshavi]] and fought the occupants from there. In July 1735, the resurgent [[Persia]]n ruler [[Nader Shah Afshar]] invaded [[Kakheti]] and forced the Turks out of most of eastern Georgia. Nader summoned Teimuraz to his headquarters at [[Erivan]] and, upon his refusal to convert to Islam, had him detained. Kakheti was placed under the nominal government of Teimuraz's Muslim nephew [[Ali Mirza of Kakheti|Ali Mirza]]. In October 1735, Teimuraz escaped to the mountains of Kakheti and fomented unrest against the Persian rule, but he was captured by the close of 1736.\n\nDuring these years, part of Georgian nobles staged a powerful rebellion against the Persian regime. In 1738, the shah had to release Teimuraz to counter the Georgian opposition, and made him governor of Kakheti, while his son [[Erekle II]] campaigned with Nader [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|in India]].{{sfn|Suny|1994|page=55}}{{sfn|Hitchins|1998|pages=541-542}} The uprising now turned into a brutal civil war between pro- and anti-Persian factions. Teimuraz, aided by his son Erekle II, was able to crush the rebels led by [[Givi Amilakhvari]]. As a reward, the shah abolished, in 1742, a heavy tribute laid upon Kakheti, and helped Teimuraz to subdue autonomous duchies of the [[Aragvi]] and the [[Ksani]] in 1743 and 1744 respectively. For his service against the [[Ottoman Turkey|Ottomans]] and an anti-Persian revolt, in 1744, Teimuraz was confirmed by the shah as king of [[Kartli]], and his son Erekle was given a Kakhetian crown, thus laying the ground for the eventual reunification of these Georgian kingdoms. Most importantly, they were recognised as [[Christianity|Christian]] kings for the first time since 1632. Both monarchs were crowned at the Cathedral of the Living Pillar ([[Svetitskhoveli]]) at [[Mtskheta]] on October 1, 1745.\n\nWith their power growing increasingly stronger, Teimuraz and Erekle soon repudiated their allegiance to the Persian suzerain. Nader Shah ordered 30,000 Persian troops to move into Georgia and entrusted a Georgian convert (and a former anti-Persian leader) Amilakhvari with the punitive operation. The shah was, however, murdered in 1747, and his empire became engulf into complete chaos. The rulers of Kartli and Kakheti took advantage of the situation and expelled all Persian garrisons from their kingdoms. From 1749 to 1750, they checked several attempts of Persian pretenders to create their powerbase in the eastern [[Transcaucasia]], and made the neighbouring [[Khan (title)|khanates]] of [[Yerevan]], [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], and [[Nakhichevan Khanate|Nakhichevan]] their tributaries. He fought then against the [[Dagestan]]i clansmen who frequently [[Lekianoba|raided]] the Georgian marchlands, but without complete success.\n\nLike several previous Georgian rulers, he hoped that the expanding [[Russian empire]] would be the only protector for the Christians of [[Caucasus]] against the Ottoman and Persian aggressions. He sent an embassy to [[St Petersburg]] in 1752, but nothing came of this mission. In 1760, he visited the Russian court himself to gain a support for his project of a Georgian expedition to Persia to put a Russian candidate on the shah\u2019s throne. The Russians were too preoccupied with the [[Seven Years' War]] to seriously consider Teimuraz\u2019s idea. He died suddenly in the Russian capital on January 8, 1762 (just a fortnight after [[Elizabeth of Russia]] incidentally), and was buried next to his father-in-law [[Vakhtang VI]] in the Cathedral of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], [[Astrakhan]]. On his death, Erekle succeeded as king of Kartli, bringing both eastern Georgian kingdoms into a single state ([[Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti]])\n\nAlthough he was constantly at war or on guard, Teimuraz found some time to translate from Persian and compose, virtually on horseback, his own poems and lyrics.\n\n==Reburial==\n[[File:Teimuraz II tomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of King Teimuraz II in Astrakhan.]]\nIn July 2013, Georgia raised the possibility to move Teimuraz's remains to Georgia for reburial.<ref>[http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=10633 Georgian patriarch to arrive in Moscow].

Two years later, on February 2, 1712, he remarried Vakhtang VI's daughter [[Tamar of Kartli|Tamar]] (born 1696), who died on April 12, 1746. The same year, on August 19, Teimuraz married his third wife, Ana-Khanum (1716 \u2014 March 1788), daughter of Prince Bejan Palavankhosroshvili-Baratashvili, and former wife of Prince Kaikhosro Tsitsishvili. He had two sons and four daughters by his second and third marriages.\n\nTeimuraz's children of his marriage to Tamar of Kartli were:\n\n* [[Heraclius II of Georgia|Heraclius II]] (November 7, 1720 \u2013 January 11, 1798), the future king of Kakheti and of Kartli and Kakheti.\n* Princess [[Princess Ketevan of Kakheti|Ketevan]], who married, in 1737 at [[Mashhad]] [[Adil Shah]] of Iran (1719\u20131749).\n* Princess Elene (fl. 1743\u20131784), who married, c. 1743, Prince Zaza [[Tsitsishvili]].\n* Princess Ana  (1720 \u2013 December 4, 1788), who married firstly, in 1744, Prince Dimitri [[Orbeliani]] (died 1776) and secondly Prince Ioane Orbeliani (c. 1702 \u2013 1781).\n\nTeimuraz's union with Ana-Khanum Baratashvili produced:\n* Prince Solomon (May 24, 1747 \u2013 July 28, 1749).\n* Princess Elisabed (March 25, 1750 \u2013 May 8, 1770), who was betrothed to Prince Giorgi [[Amilakhvari]] in 1762, but the marriage was disrupted for political reasons in 1765 and Elisabed was given in marriage, on November 16, 1765, to [[Katsia II Dadiani]], [[Principality of Mingrelia|Prince of Mingrelia]] (died 1788).\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Teimuraz II of Kakheti}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources ==\n* {{cite encyclopedia | article = EREKLE II | last = Hitchins | first = Keith | authorlink = | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/erekle-ii | editor-last = | editor-first = | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. VIII, Fasc. 5 | pages = 541-542 | location = | publisher = | year = 1998 | isbn = |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Suny|first1=Ronald Grigor|authorlink1=Ronald Grigor Suny|title=The Making of the Georgian Nation|date=1994|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253209153|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{in lang|en}} [http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Georgia/kakhet3.htm The Royal Ark]\n*{{in lang|en}} [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/georgia-ii-history- Iranian-Georgian Relations in the 16th- 19th Centuries] in [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica]]\n*[[Donald Rayfield]], ''[[The Literature of Georgia: A History]]'' (August 16, 2000), Routledge, {{ISBN|0-7007-1163-5}}, page 126-7 (about Teimuraz\u2019s poetry)\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Constantine II of Kakheti|Constantine II]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of the Kings of Georgia|King of Kakheti]]|years=1732\u20131744}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Heraclius II of Georgia|Heraclius II]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=Persian rule}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of the Kings of Georgia|King of Kartli]]|years=1744\u20131762}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Heraclius II of Georgia|Heraclius II]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Triarchy in Georgia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Teimuraz 02}}\n[[Category:Kings of Georgia]]\n[[Category:Kings of Kakheti]]\n[[Category:Former Muslims from Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Converts to Eastern Orthodoxy from Shia Islam]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox monarchs]]\n[[Category:Bagrationi dynasty of the Kingdom of Kakheti]]\n[[Category:18th-century poets from Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Safavid governors of Kakheti]]\n[[Category:Afsharid governors of Kakheti]]\n[[Category:1680 births]]\n[[Category:1762 deaths]]\n[[Category:Male poets from Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Afsharid appointed kings of Kartli]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSources:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teimuraz_II_of_Kakheti"}

Walsh''' was one of the service's most famous combat veterans whose World War II combat exploits included one action that resulted in his receiving the Navy Cross, the nation's second highest award for valor in combat.\n\n==Early life and early Coast Guard career==\nWalsh was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], on February 2, 1910, and graduated in 1933 from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in [[New London, Connecticut]]. His first assignments were aboard the Coast Guard cutters that captured \"rum runners\" between [[Cuba]] and [[Nova Scotia]] during prohibition. In September 1934, Walsh transferred to Coast Guard Cutter Yamacraw, based in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. As boarding officer, he played an important role in the capture of the notorious rumrunner Pronto in January 1936. In the late 1930s, he spent a year as an observer on a whaling factory ship cruising 30,000 miles from Sweden to Australia, the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Antarctica]] and at one point, the crew spent 132 straight days without seeing land. During his tour as an inspector, the Ulysses crew had killed 3,665 whales. Walsh\u2019s firsthand knowledge of whaling practices heavily influenced the formulation of U.S. whaling policy against commercial whaling.\n\nIn October 1939, Walsh transferred to the 327-foot cutter Campbell and served as navigator and gunnery officer while the cutter convoyed merchantmen across the North Atlantic as part of the American Neutrality Patrols. During Walsh\u2019s assignment, Campbell also served on the Lisbon station to protect U.S. citizens in Portugal, threatened at the time by the spread of war in Europe.\n\nIn November 1941, just before the entry of the United States into World War II, Walsh received yet another assignment as navigator. This time he served on board the famous Coast Guard-manned troop transport ''Joseph T. Dickman'', ferrying British troops from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Bombay, India. The ship also supported amphibious training with U.S. Marines on the North Carolina coast and landed troops at Cuba, Puerto Rico and Bermuda.\n\n==World War II==\nNext, Walsh received orders to the staff of Commander U.S. Naval Forces in Europe, located in London. As a member of the Naval Forces staff, Walsh gained full knowledge of Phase Neptune, the amphibious operation associated with [[Operation Overlord]], the allied invasion of Europe. This landing would prove the largest amphibious operation in world history and Walsh had to formulate plans to restore operations in liberated French ports to expedite resupply of allied armies by ship.\n\nThe D-Day invasion took place on Tuesday, June 6, 1944. Walsh and his men landed on Saturday, at [[Utah Beach]] and advanced westward toward the port of Cherbourg. Walsh\u2019s mission was to secure the harbor and prepare the port facilities to receive shipments of troops and supplies as soon possible. When Walsh\u2019s unit entered the city on Monday, June 26, as part of the U.S. Army\u2019s 79th Infantry Division, he came under fire from machine gun nests still defending German positions and his unit uncovered stubborn pockets of enemy resistance.\n\nBy Tuesday, June 27, Walsh\u2019s men had fought their way through to Cherbourg\u2019s harbor. During this assault, Walsh moved his men quickly to occupy strategic parts of the port and take control the harbor. During the assault, the men in his unit experienced a 25 percent casualty rate. By the end of the day, Walsh\u2019s unit had advanced to the city\u2019s old naval arsenal, where he accepted the surrender of 400 German troops.\n\nAfter capturing Cherbourg\u2019s port facilities, Walsh learned that the Germans held American paratroopers in the city\u2019s old citadel at Fort du Homet. In the highlight of the Cherbourg operation, Walsh and one of his officers put themselves in harm\u2019s way to save the lives of the Americans. The two officers entered the fort under a flag of truce and met with the commanding officer of the German garrison. By greatly exaggerating the numeric strength of his small force of Sea Bees, Walsh convinced the commanding officer to surrender the stronghold. With the surrender of Fort du Homet, Walsh and his men disarmed another 350 German troops and liberated over 50 American prisoners.\n\nWith Cherbourg secured, Walsh began preparing the port for operations. He established a naval operations center, surveyed the harbor and collected vital intelligence from German prisoners, French partisans and slave laborers who worked around the port. With this information, Walsh mapped underwater obstructions, navigable channels and minefields in the harbor and its approaches. He sent this information to allied minesweepers using shallow-draft wooden sailing vessels.\n\nWithin a few short days of entering Cherbourg, Walsh\u2019s 50 men had taken 750 German troops, liberated over 50 American prisoners, captured Cherbourg\u2019s port and helped clear the harbor of enemy mines and obstructions. By Walsh\u2019s third day in Cherbourg, the Navy decommissioned his unit and designated him as Cherbourg\u2019s assistant port director. His unit had not only secured Cherbourg and saved American lives, it sped thousands of troops and millions of tons of ammunition, equipment and war material to the front lines.\n\nAfter Le Havre, Walsh contracted a severe case of viral pneumonia. He was hospitalized in London then he returned to the U.S. During the next year, he helped oversee the permanent transfer of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation from the Commerce Department into the Coast Guard. Meantime, Walsh\u2019s health problems persisted and, in 1946, the service placed him on the retired list due to physical disability.\n\nWith the onset of the Korean War, he returned to active duty in 1951. He served as liaison officer between the Coast Guard and Treasury Department and later served as aide to the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury overseeing Coast Guard affairs. Walsh finally retired as a captain in 1960.\n\nWalsh passed away in May of 2000. His career had spanned some of the most eventful years in Coast Guard history, including Prohibition, World War II and the post-war modernization of the service. Walsh was a member of the long blue line and played an important role in the service\u2019s missions of law enforcement, fisheries management, combat operations, port security, and organizational change.<ref>https://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2016/07/the-long-blue-line-quentin-walshs-long-colorful-career/</ref>\n\n===Navy Cross===\nCitation:\n''The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Lieutenant Commander Quentin R. Walsh, United States Coast Guard, for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service in the line of his profession as Commanding Officer of a specially trained U.S. Naval Reconnaissance Party assigned the mission of reconnoitering the Naval Facilities and Arsenal at Cherbourg, France, on 26 and 27 June 1944. A gallant and aggressive leader, Commander Walsh courageously engaged in active street fighting with the enemy as he led his party in the skillful penetration of the eastern half of the city and, while advancing through scattered pockets of resistance and extremely hazardous areas which were still subjected to hostile fire, accepted the surrender of approximately four hundred enemy forces at the Naval Arsenal and disarmed them. Subsequently receiving the unconditional surrender of three hundred and fifty other officers and men, he released fifty-two United States Army Paratroopers who were prisoners in the fort. Commander Walsh's brilliant initiative, inspiring leadership and successful accomplishment of a difficult mission reflect great credit upon himself, his command and the United States Naval Service.''\n\n==Awards==\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Navy Cross ribbon.svg}} [[Navy Cross]]<br>\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Coast Guard Commendation ribbon.svg}} [[U.S. Coast Guard|Commendation Medal]]<br>\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Combat Action Ribbon.svg}} [[Combat Action Ribbon]]<br>\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=A device|ribbon=American Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg}} [[American Defense Service Medal]]\n{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign ribbon.svg}} [[European\u2013African\u2013Middle Eastern Campaign Medal]]<br>\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal ribbon.svg}} [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]]<br>\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=World War II Victory Medal ribbon.svg}} [[World War II Victory Medal]]<br>\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=National Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg}} [[National Defense Service Medal]]\n{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=U.S. Coast Guard Sea Service Ribbon.svg}} [[U.S. Coast Guard|Sea Service Ribbon]]\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=CG OS Tour Ribbon.svg}} [[Overseas Service Ribbon]]\n\n===Legacy===\nA future Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, DDG 132, in honor of Coast Guard Capt.

Walsh''' was one of the service's most famous combat veterans whose World War II combat exploits included one action that resulted in his receiving the Navy Cross, the nation's second highest award for valor in combat.\n\n==Early life and early Coast Guard career==\nWalsh was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], on February 2, 1910, and graduated in 1933 from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in [[New London, Connecticut]]. His first assignments were aboard the Coast Guard cutters that captured \"rum runners\" between [[Cuba]] and [[Nova Scotia]] during prohibition. In September 1934, Walsh transferred to Coast Guard Cutter Yamacraw, based in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. As boarding officer, he played an important role in the capture of the notorious rumrunner Pronto in January 1936. In the late 1930s, he spent a year as an observer on a whaling factory ship cruising 30,000 miles from Sweden to Australia, the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Antarctica]] and at one point, the crew spent 132 straight days without seeing land. During his tour as an inspector, the Ulysses crew had killed 3,665 whales. Walsh\u2019s firsthand knowledge of whaling practices heavily influenced the formulation of U.S. whaling policy against commercial whaling.\n\nIn October 1939, Walsh transferred to the 327-foot cutter Campbell and served as navigator and gunnery officer while the cutter convoyed merchantmen across the North Atlantic as part of the American Neutrality Patrols. During Walsh\u2019s assignment, Campbell also served on the Lisbon station to protect U.S. citizens in Portugal, threatened at the time by the spread of war in Europe.\n\nIn November 1941, just before the entry of the United States into World War II, Walsh received yet another assignment as navigator. This time he served on board the famous Coast Guard-manned troop transport ''Joseph T. Dickman'', ferrying British troops from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Bombay, India. The ship also supported amphibious training with U.S. Marines on the North Carolina coast and landed troops at Cuba, Puerto Rico and Bermuda.\n\n==World War II==\nNext, Walsh received orders to the staff of Commander U.S. Naval Forces in Europe, located in London. As a member of the Naval Forces staff, Walsh gained full knowledge of Phase Neptune, the amphibious operation associated with [[Operation Overlord]], the allied invasion of Europe. This landing would prove the largest amphibious operation in world history and Walsh had to formulate plans to restore operations in liberated French ports to expedite resupply of allied armies by ship.\n\nThe D-Day invasion took place on Tuesday, June 6, 1944. Walsh and his men landed on Saturday, at [[Utah Beach]] and advanced westward toward the port of Cherbourg. Walsh\u2019s mission was to secure the harbor and prepare the port facilities to receive shipments of troops and supplies as soon possible. When Walsh\u2019s unit entered the city on Monday, June 26, as part of the U.S. Army\u2019s 79th Infantry Division, he came under fire from machine gun nests still defending German positions and his unit uncovered stubborn pockets of enemy resistance.\n\nBy Tuesday, June 27, Walsh\u2019s men had fought their way through to Cherbourg\u2019s harbor. During this assault, Walsh moved his men quickly to occupy strategic parts of the port and take control the harbor. During the assault, the men in his unit experienced a 25 percent casualty rate. By the end of the day, Walsh\u2019s unit had advanced to the city\u2019s old naval arsenal, where he accepted the surrender of 400 German troops.\n\nAfter capturing Cherbourg\u2019s port facilities, Walsh learned that the Germans held American paratroopers in the city\u2019s old citadel at Fort du Homet. In the highlight of the Cherbourg operation, Walsh and one of his officers put themselves in harm\u2019s way to save the lives of the Americans. The two officers entered the fort under a flag of truce and met with the commanding officer of the German garrison. By greatly exaggerating the numeric strength of his small force of Sea Bees, Walsh convinced the commanding officer to surrender the stronghold. With the surrender of Fort du Homet, Walsh and his men disarmed another 350 German troops and liberated over 50 American prisoners.\n\nWith Cherbourg secured, Walsh began preparing the port for operations. He established a naval operations center, surveyed the harbor and collected vital intelligence from German prisoners, French partisans and slave laborers who worked around the port. With this information, Walsh mapped underwater obstructions, navigable channels and minefields in the harbor and its approaches. He sent this information to allied minesweepers using shallow-draft wooden sailing vessels.\n\nWithin a few short days of entering Cherbourg, Walsh\u2019s 50 men had taken 750 German troops, liberated over 50 American prisoners, captured Cherbourg\u2019s port and helped clear the harbor of enemy mines and obstructions. By Walsh\u2019s third day in Cherbourg, the Navy decommissioned his unit and designated him as Cherbourg\u2019s assistant port director. His unit had not only secured Cherbourg and saved American lives, it sped thousands of troops and millions of tons of ammunition, equipment and war material to the front lines.\n\nAfter Le Havre, Walsh contracted a severe case of viral pneumonia. He was hospitalized in London then he returned to the U.S. During the next year, he helped oversee the permanent transfer of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation from the Commerce Department into the Coast Guard. Meantime, Walsh\u2019s health problems persisted and, in 1946, the service placed him on the retired list due to physical disability.\n\nWith the onset of the Korean War, he returned to active duty in 1951. He served as liaison officer between the Coast Guard and Treasury Department and later served as aide to the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury overseeing Coast Guard affairs. Walsh finally retired as a captain in 1960.\n\nWalsh passed away in May of 2000. His career had spanned some of the most eventful years in Coast Guard history, including Prohibition, World War II and the post-war modernization of the service. Walsh was a member of the long blue line and played an important role in the service\u2019s missions of law enforcement, fisheries management, combat operations, port security, and organizational change.<ref>https://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2016/07/the-long-blue-line-quentin-walshs-long-colorful-career/</ref>\n\n===Navy Cross===\nCitation:\n''The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Lieutenant Commander Quentin R. Walsh, United States Coast Guard, for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service in the line of his profession as Commanding Officer of a specially trained U.S. Naval Reconnaissance Party assigned the mission of reconnoitering the Naval Facilities and Arsenal at Cherbourg, France, on 26 and 27 June 1944. A gallant and aggressive leader, Commander Walsh courageously engaged in active street fighting with the enemy as he led his party in the skillful penetration of the eastern half of the city and, while advancing through scattered pockets of resistance and extremely hazardous areas which were still subjected to hostile fire, accepted the surrender of approximately four hundred enemy forces at the Naval Arsenal and disarmed them. Subsequently receiving the unconditional surrender of three hundred and fifty other officers and men, he released fifty-two United States Army Paratroopers who were prisoners in the fort. Commander Walsh's brilliant initiative, inspiring leadership and successful accomplishment of a difficult mission reflect great credit upon himself, his command and the United States Naval Service.''\n\n==Awards==\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Navy Cross ribbon.svg}} [[Navy Cross]]<br>\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Coast Guard Commendation ribbon.svg}} [[U.S. Coast Guard|Commendation Medal]]<br>\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Combat Action Ribbon.svg}} [[Combat Action Ribbon]]<br>\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=A device|ribbon=American Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg}} [[American Defense Service Medal]]\n{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign ribbon.svg}} [[European\u2013African\u2013Middle Eastern Campaign Medal]]<br>\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal ribbon.svg}} [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]]<br>\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=World War II Victory Medal ribbon.svg}} [[World War II Victory Medal]]<br>\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=National Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg}} [[National Defense Service Medal]]\n{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=U.S. Coast Guard Sea Service Ribbon.svg}} [[U.S. Coast Guard|Sea Service Ribbon]]\n{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=CG OS Tour Ribbon.svg}} [[Overseas Service Ribbon]]\n\n===Legacy===\nA future Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, DDG 132, in honor of Coast Guard Capt.

{"title_page": "1932 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1932 season was the 24th season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]].\n\n[[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] won the Senior grade with a 7 win, 2 draw, and 1 loss record ahead of [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]. They were the dominant team and their only loss came in the final round when they had already secured their second title first having won it in 1928. [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] stuffed their trophy cabinet when they won the Roope Rooster (defeating [[City Rovers]] 28\u20138), Stormont Shield (defeating [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] 15\u20138), and Max Jaffe Cup for finishing runner up in the Senior Championship (they beat [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] in a playoff after both teams tied for second by 37 to 8). [[City Rovers]] won the Thistle Cup after beating [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] in the final by 22 to 19 after both teams finished with 8 competitions points in the second round thus forcing a playoff for the Cup. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] won the Davis Shield after their lower grade teams combined for the most competition points in Auckland. This was remarkably their 10th win in the Shields 12 year history.\n\nIn the reserve grade [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Reserves]] won with an 8 win, 2 loss record, with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby Reserves]] finishing runner up. The [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] club added yet another trophy to their season haul with their reserve grade team winning the Stallard Cup (awarded to the reserve grade knockout winners) when they beat [[North Shore Albions|Devonport Reserves]] by 12\u20136 in the final.\n\nThe representative program was marked by a match between [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] and the touring [[England national rugby league team|England team]]. In a very competitive match Auckland went down by 14 to 19. Aside from this fixture Auckland did not play any other full representative matches. An Auckland XIII played a match against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] where they won 29 to 13, and a series of trial matches such as North Island v South Island and Probables v Possibles matches were played featuring many Auckland players.\n\n== Annual General Meeting ==\nAt the annual general meeting of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] on 11 April [[Ted Phelan|Mr. E.J.

The [[Auckland Rugby League]] were not interested in a replay as it was a matter of a possible refereeing error rather than an incorrect rule interpretation.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee/Ponsonby Club\u2019s Protest/Venue of Senior Matches\n| page =7\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXIX| issue=21192\n| date = 1932-05-26\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19320526.2.27.5\n| accessdate = 2019-11-06}}</ref> In Round 9 it was decided to play the reserve and senior matches between [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] and [[City Rovers|City]] at the [[Northcote, New Zealand|Northcote]] municipal ground at Stafford Park to help raise funds for the Northcote relief fund as the depression was in full swing by this time.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northcote Committee\n| page = 3\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIII| issue=151\n| date = 1932-06-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19320628.2.19\n| accessdate = 2019-11-09}}</ref> A sum of nearly \u00a37 was raised for the Northcote Relief Committee as a result of the collection taken up at the match.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Unemployed Relief/Northcote Activities\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIII| issue=156\n| date = 1932-07-04\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19320704.2.57\n| accessdate = 2019-11-09}}</ref>\n\nThe Round 10 matches were postponed due to heavy rain.

They were the dominant team and their only loss came in the final round when they had already secured their second title first having won it in 1928. [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] stuffed their trophy cabinet when they won the Roope Rooster (defeating [[City Rovers]] 28-8), Stormont Shield (defeating [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] 15-8), and Max Jaffe Cup for finishing runner up in the Senior Championship (they beat [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] in a playoff after both teams tied for second by 37 to 8). [[City Rovers]] won the Thistle Cup after beating [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] in the final by 22 to 19 after both teams finished with 8 competitions points in the second round thus forcing a playoff for the Cup. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] won the Davis Shield after their lower grade teams combined for the most competition points in Auckland. This was remarkably their 10th win in the Shields 12 year history.\n\nIn the reserve grade [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Reserves]] won with an 8 win, 2 loss record, with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby Reserves]] finishing runner up. The [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] club added yet another trophy to their season haul with their reserve grade team winning the Stallard Cup (awarded to the reserve grade knockout winners) when they beat [[North Shore Albions|Devonport Reserves]] by 12-6 in the final.\n\nThe representative program was marked by a match between [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] and the touring [[England national rugby league team|England team]]. In a very competitive match Auckland went down by 14 to 19. Aside from this fixture Auckland did not play any other full representative matches. An Auckland XIII played a match against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] where they won 29 to 13, and a series of trial matches such as North Island v South Island and Probables v Possibles matches were played featuring many Auckland players.\n\n== Annual General Meeting ==\nAt the annual general meeting of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] on April 11 [[Ted Phelan|Mr. E.J.

{"title_page": "Chilam Balam", "text_new": "[[File:Chilam Balam Ixil.jpg|thumb|right|Copy of the Book of Chilam Balam of Ixil in the National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico]]\nThe Books of '''Chilam Balam''' ({{IPA-myn|t\u0361\u0283ilam \u0253ahlam}}) are handwritten, chiefly 17th and 18th-centuries [[Maya civilization | Maya]] [[miscellanies]], named after the small [[Yucatec]] towns where they were originally kept, and preserving important traditional knowledge in which indigenous Maya and early Spanish traditions have coalesced. Written in the [[Yucatec Maya language]] and using the Latin alphabet, the manuscripts are attributed to a legendary author called Chilam Balam, a ''chilam'' being a priest who gives prophecies and ''balam'' a common surname meaning \u02bc[[jaguar]]\u02bc. Some of the texts actually contain prophecies about the coming of the Spaniards to Yucat\u00e1n while mentioning a ''chilam'' Balam as their first author.<ref>Roys 1967: 3, 186-187</ref>\n \nNine Books of Chilam Balam are known,<ref>Paxton 2001:193-194</ref> most importantly those from [[Chumayel Municipality|Chumayel]], [[Man\u00ed, Yucat\u00e1n|Mani]], and [[Tizimin]],<ref>Roys 1967:6</ref> but more have existed. Both language and content show that parts of the books date back to the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatan|Spanish conquest of the Yucatec kingdoms]] (1527\u20131546). In some cases, where the language is particularly terse, the books appear to render hieroglyphic script, and thus to hark back to the pre-conquest period.\n\n==Contents==\nTaken together, the Books of Chilam Balam give the fullness of 18th-century Yucatec-Maya spiritual life. Whereas the medical texts and chronicles are quite matter-of-fact, the riddles and prognostications make abundant use of traditional Mayan metaphors. This holds even more true of the mythological and ritualistic texts, which, cast in abstruse language, plainly belong to [[esoteric]] lore. The historical texts derive part of their importance from the fact that they have been cast in the framework of the native [[Maya calendar]], partly adapted to the European calendrical system. Reconstructing [[Postclassic period|Postclassic Yucatec history]] from these data has proven to be an arduous task. The following is an overview of the sorts of texts\u2014partly of Mesoamerican, and partly of Spanish derivation\u2014found in the Chilam Balam books.\n\n1. '''History''' \n*''Histories'', cast in the mold of the indigenous calendar: migration legends; narratives concerning certain lords of the indigenous kingdoms; and chronicles up to and including the Spanish conquest.\n*''Prognostication'', cast in the framework of the succession of ''[[haab]]''s (years), ''[[Tun (Maya calendar)|tun]]''s (360-day periods) and ''[[k\u02bcatun]]''s (20X360-day periods).\n*''Prophecy'', ascribed to famous early 16th-century oracular priests.\n\n2. '''Formularies with Metaphors''' \n*''Collections of riddles'', used for the confirmation of local lords into their offices (the so-called 'language of Zuyua').\n\n3. '''Myth and Mysticism'''\n*''Myth'', particularly the destruction and re-creation of the world as connected to the start of [[k\u02bcatun]] 11 Ahau.<ref>Knowlton 2010:53-85</ref>\n*''Ritualistic mysticism'', particularly concerning the creation of the twenty named days (''[[uinal]]''); the ritual of the 'Four Burners' (''ahtoc''); and the birth of the maize, or 'divine grace' (the so-called 'Ritual of the Angels').<ref>Roys 1967:107-113</ref>\n\n4. '''Practical Calendars and Classifications''' \n*''Classifications according to the twenty named days'' (correlating birds of tiding, plants and trees, human characters, and professional activities).\n*''Treatises on astrology, meteorology, and the Catholic liturgical calendar'' (the so-called ''reportorios de los tiempos''). The astrology is Ptolemaic and includes the European zodiac.\n*''Agricultural [[almanac]]s''.\n\n5. '''Medical Recipes'''\n*''Herbal medicine'': The Chilam Balam books contain the sort of medical prescriptions that derive from Greek and Arab traditions, rather than the Mayan 'incantation approach', as represented by the [[Ritual of the Bacabs]].<ref>Paxton 2001: 191</ref>\n\n6. '''Spanish Traditions'''\n*''Roman Catholic instruction'': feast days of the saints, tracts, and prayers.\n*''Spanish [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]]'', such as the tale of the 'Maiden Theodora'.\n\n==Scholarship==\nSince many texts recur in various books of Chilam Balam, establishing a [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] and studying substitution patterns is fundamental to scholarship.<ref>Miram and Miram 1988</ref> The archaic Yucatec idiom and the allusive, metaphorical nature of many texts present a formidable challenge to translators. The outcome of the translation process is sometimes heavily influenced by external assumptions about the texts' purpose. As a result of these factors, the quality of existing translations varies greatly.\n\nThe Spanish-language synoptic translation of Barrera V\u00e1squez and Rend\u00f3n (1948) is still useful. To date (2012), complete English translations are available for the following Books of Chilam Balam: \n*Chumayel (authoritative edition: Roys 1933 [1967]; compare with Edmonson 1986)\n*Mani (embedded in the P\u00e9rez Codex: Craine and Reindorp 1979, an adaptation of the 1949 Mexican translation of Sol\u00eds Alcal\u00e1)\n*Tizimin (Edmonson 1982)\n*Na (Gubler and Bolles 2000)\n*Kaua (Bricker and Miram 2002)\nAn excellent overview and discussion of the [[syncretism]] involved is to be found in the introduction to the Bricker and Miram edition of the Book of Chilam Balam of Kaua.<ref>Bricker and Miram 2002:1-88</ref> A detailed analysis and interpretation of the main mythological and ritualistic texts with a view to their syncretic origins is given by Knowlton (2010).\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Books of Chilam Balam are referenced in ''[[The Falling Woman]]'' by Pat Murphy as source material for the description of sacrifices at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1.\n\nA poem from the Chilam Balam is prominently featured in a short story by the U.S.-born writer [[Lucia_Berlin|Lucia Berlin]], who spent many years living and traveling in Latin America, including Chile and Mexico.  The poem gives Berlin's story its title.  Here is the poem:  \"Toda Luna, todo a\u00f1o,/ Todo d\u00eda, todo viento/ Camina, y pasa tambi\u00e9n./ Tambi\u00e9n, toda sangre llega/ Al lugar de su quietude.\"  The Spanish is probably a translation from the Mayan.  The story's heroine translates the poem as follows:  \"Every moon, every year/ Every day, every breeze/ Goes along, and passes away./ And thus all blood arrives/ To its own quiet place.\"  <ref>Lucia Berlin, ''A Manuel for Cleaning Women: Selected Stories''.

Some of the texts actually contain prophecies about the coming of the Spaniards to Yucat\u00e1n while mentioning a ''chilam'' Balam as their first author.<ref>Roys 1967: 3, 186-187</ref>\n \nNine Books of Chilam Balam are known,<ref>Paxton 2001:193-194</ref> most importantly those from [[Chumayel Municipality|Chumayel]], [[Man\u00ed, Yucat\u00e1n|Mani]], and [[Tizimin]],<ref>Roys 1967:6</ref> but more have existed. Both language and content show that parts of the books date back to the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatan|Spanish conquest of the Yucatec kingdoms]] (1527\u20131546). In some cases, where the language is particularly terse, the books appear to render hieroglyphic script, and thus to hark back to the pre-conquest period.\n\n==Contents==\nTaken together, the Books of Chilam Balam give the fullness of 18th-century Yucatec-Maya spiritual life. Whereas the medical texts and chronicles are quite matter-of-fact, the riddles and prognostications make abundant use of traditional Mayan metaphors. This holds even more true of the mythological and ritualistic texts, which, cast in abstruse language, plainly belong to [[esoteric]] lore. The historical texts derive part of their importance from the fact that they have been cast in the framework of the native [[Maya calendar]], partly adapted to the European calendrical system. Reconstructing [[Postclassic period|Postclassic Yucatec history]] from these data has proven to be an arduous task. The following is an overview of the sorts of texts\u2014partly of Mesoamerican, and partly of Spanish derivation\u2014found in the Chilam Balam books.\n\n1. '''History''' \n*''Histories'', cast in the mold of the indigenous calendar: migration legends; narratives concerning certain lords of the indigenous kingdoms; and chronicles up to and including the Spanish conquest.\n*''Prognostication'', cast in the framework of the succession of ''[[haab]]''s (years), ''[[Tun (Maya calendar)|tun]]''s (360-day periods) and ''[[k\u02bcatun]]''s (20X360-day periods).\n*''Prophecy'', ascribed to famous early 16th-century oracular priests.\n\n2. '''Formularies with Metaphors''' \n*''Collections of riddles'', used for the confirmation of local lords into their offices (the so-called 'language of Zuyua').\n\n3. '''Myth and Mysticism'''\n*''Myth'', particularly the destruction and re-creation of the world as connected to the start of [[k\u02bcatun]] 11 Ahau.<ref>Knowlton 2010:53-85</ref>\n*''Ritualistic mysticism'', particularly concerning the creation of the twenty named days (''[[uinal]]''); the ritual of the 'Four Burners' (''ahtoc''); and the birth of the maize, or 'divine grace' (the so-called 'Ritual of the Angels').<ref>Roys 1967:107-113</ref>\n\n4. '''Practical Calendars and Classifications''' \n*''Classifications according to the twenty named days'' (correlating birds of tiding, plants and trees, human characters, and professional activities).\n*''Treatises on astrology, meteorology, and the Catholic liturgical calendar'' (the so-called ''reportorios de los tiempos''). The astrology is Ptolemaic and includes the European zodiac.\n*''Agricultural [[almanac]]s''.\n\n5. '''Medical Recipes'''\n*''Herbal medicine'': The Chilam Balam books contain the sort of medical prescriptions that derive from Greek and Arab traditions, rather than the Mayan 'incantation approach', as represented by the [[Ritual of the Bacabs]].<ref>Paxton 2001: 191</ref>\n\n6. '''Spanish Traditions'''\n*''Roman Catholic instruction'': feast days of the saints, tracts, and prayers.\n*''Spanish [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]]'', such as the tale of the 'Maiden Theodora'.\n\n==Scholarship==\nSince many texts recur in various books of Chilam Balam, establishing a [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] and studying substitution patterns is fundamental to scholarship.<ref>Miram and Miram 1988</ref> The archaic Yucatec idiom and the allusive, metaphorical nature of many texts present a formidable challenge to translators. The outcome of the translation process is sometimes heavily influenced by external assumptions about the texts' purpose. As a result of these factors, the quality of existing translations varies greatly.\n\nThe Spanish-language synoptic translation of Barrera V\u00e1squez and Rend\u00f3n (1948) is still useful. To date (2012), complete English translations are available for the following Books of Chilam Balam: \n*Chumayel (authoritative edition: Roys 1933 [1967]; compare with Edmonson 1986)\n*Mani (embedded in the P\u00e9rez Codex: Craine and Reindorp 1979, an adaptation of the 1949 Mexican translation of Sol\u00eds Alcal\u00e1)\n*Tizimin (Edmonson 1982)\n*Na (Gubler and Bolles 2000)\n*Kaua (Bricker and Miram 2002)\nAn excellent overview and discussion of the [[syncretism]] involved is to be found in the introduction to the Bricker and Miram edition of the Book of Chilam Balam of Kaua.<ref>Bricker and Miram 2002:1-88</ref> A detailed analysis and interpretation of the main mythological and ritualistic texts with a view to their syncretic origins is given by Knowlton (2010).\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Books of Chilam Balam are referenced in ''[[The Falling Woman]]'' by Pat Murphy as source material for the description of sacrifices at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1.\n\nA poem from the Chilam Balam is prominently featured in a short story by the U.S.-born writer [[Lucia_Berlin|Lucia Berlin]], who spent many years living and traveling in Latin America, including Chile and Mexico.  The poem gives Berlin's story its title.  Here is the poem:  \"Toda Luna, todo a\u00f1o,/ Todo d\u00eda, todo viento/ Camina, y pasa tambi\u00e9n./ Tambi\u00e9n, toda sangre llega/ Al lugar de su quietude.\"  The Spanish is probably a translation from the Mayan.  The story's heroine translates the poem as follows:  \"Every moon, every year/ Every day, every breeze/ Goes along, and passes away./ Thus all blood/ Arrives at its quietude.\"  <ref>Lucia Berlin, ''A Manuel for Cleaning Women: Selected Stories''.
