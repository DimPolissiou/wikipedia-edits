Her speaking voice is provided by actress [[Ming-Na Wen]], while singer [[Lea Salonga]] provides the character's singing voice. Created by author [[Robert D. San Souci]], Mulan is based on the legendary Chinese warrior [[Hua Mulan]] from the poem the ''[[Ballad of Mulan]]''. The only [[child]] of an aging [[war veteran]], Mulan disregards both tradition and the law by disguising herself as a man in order to enlist herself in the army in lieu of her feeble father.\n\nDisney had originally conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman who ultimately [[Elopement|elopes]] to Europe to be with a British prince. However, director [[Tony Bancroft]], who was inspired by the well-being of his own daughters, wanted Mulan to be a different, unique kind of Disney heroine \u2013 one who is strong and independent, whose fate does not depend upon a male character. Thus, the relationship between Mulan and [[Li Shang (Mulan character)|Captain Li Shang]] was relegated to that of a minor [[subplot]], while Mulan's bravery and strength were emphasized in order to ensure that she remained the hero of her own story. Mulan's supervising animator was [[Mark Henn]], who deliberately designed the character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors. Mulan is the eighth [[Disney Princess]] in the lineup and the franchise\u2019s first East Asian in the group. Even though she is not a traditional princess by royalty or marrying a prince she is still considered one because she is a positive role model for children and a popular heroine and warrior.\n\nReception towards Mulan's personality has been generally positive, with critics praising her bravery and heroism. However, some commentators have accused Disney of [[Westernization|Westernizing]] the character,{{who|date=March 2020}} while her romantic relationship with Shang has been widely accused of compromising Mulan's heroism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Both Wen and Salonga have been awarded [[Disney Legends]] for their contributions to the role. [[Liu Yifei]] will play the live-action version of the character in the [[Mulan (2020 film)|2020 live-action adaptation]] of the original 1998 film.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Development==\n\n=== Conception and writing ===\n''Mulan ''was originally conceived as an [[Animated cartoon|animated short]] in 1994, in which a miserable Chinese girl elopes to the West to be with a British prince.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title = Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide|last = Shaffer|first = Joshua C.|publisher = AuthorHouse|isbn = 978-1-4520-6312-6|location = United States|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cV50CpKZ4YEC&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=china+doll+mulan#v=onepage&q=china%20doll%20mulan&f=false|date = September 22, 2010|accessdate = March 11, 2014|chapter = Mulan}}</ref> While developing a series of [[Film treatment|treatments]] based on traditional stories and folk tales, [[children's book]] author [[Robert D.

The Chinese emperor orders that the army protect his citizens over himself, general mobilization, issuing a conscription that one man from each family to join the Chinese army. After Mulan's meeting with the matchmaker goes horribly awry, Chi Fu arrives at her home to enlist her father. Although she protests knowing her veteran father can not survive another war, Mulan is silenced by both Chi Fu and her father. That evening, Mulan takes her father's old armor and disguises herself as a boy named Ping, enlisting in the army on his behalf. Upon learning of Mulan's departure, the ancestors order the small dragon Mushu, a disgraced former guardian, to awaken the  \"great stone dragon\" so that he may retrieve Mulan, only for Mushu to destroy the statue. Mushu decides to join Mulan in the army and help train her in the hopes that the ancestors will crown him a guardian once again.\n\nReporting to the training camp, Mulan is able to pass as a man, although her military skills are initially lacking. Mushu provides clumsy guidance to Mulan on how to behave like a man. Under the command of Captain Li Shang, she and her fellow recruits Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, gradually become trained warriors. Desiring to see Mulan succeed, Mushu creates a fake order from Shang's father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main imperial army into the mountains. The reinforcements set out, but arrive at a burnt-out encampment, where they discover that General Li and his troops have been massacred by the Huns.\n\nAs the reinforcements solemnly leave the mountains, they are ambushed by the Huns, but Mulan cleverly uses a cannon to cause an avalanche, which buries most of the invaders. An enraged Shan Yu slashes her in the chest, and after the avalanche subsides, her deception is revealed when the wound is bandaged.\n\nInstead of executing Mulan as the law requires, Shang spares her life, but nonetheless expels her from the army. Mulan is left to follow alone as the recruits depart for the imperial city to report the news of the Huns' destruction. However, it is discovered that several Hun warriors, including Shan Yu, have survived the avalanche, and Mulan catches sight of them as they make their way to the city, intent on capturing the emperor.\n\nAt the imperial city, Mulan is unable to convince Shang about Shan Yu's survival; the Huns capture the emperor, and seize the palace. With Mulan's help, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po pose as concubines, and are able to enter the palace. With the help of Shang, they defeat Shan Yu's men; as Shang prevents Shan Yu from assassinating the Emperor, Mulan lures the Hun leader onto the roof, where she engages him in single combat. Meanwhile, acting on Mulan's instructions and signal, Mushu fires a large skyrocket at Shan Yu. The rocket strikes, and propels him into a fireworks launching tower, where he dies in the resulting explosion.\n\nMulan is praised by the Emperor and the assembled inhabitants of the city, who bow to her in an unprecedented honor. While she accepts the crest of the Emperor, and the sword of Shan Yu as gifts, she politely declines his offer to be his advisor, and asks to return to her family.\n\nMulan returns home, where she presents these gifts to her father, who is overjoyed to have Mulan back safely. Having become enamored with Mulan, Shang soon arrives under the pretext of returning her helmet, but accepts the family's invitation to stay for dinner. Mushu is reinstated as a Fa family guardian by the ancestors amid a returning celebration. When Mulan thanks Mushu, she kisses him on the forehead, followed by her dog, Little Brother, and a herd of chickens bursting into the Temple, with a Great Ancestor calling Mushu's name, ending the film.\n\n====''Mulan II''====\n{{Main|Mulan II}}\nOne whole month after the events of the original movie, Mulan and [[Li Shang (Mulan character)|Li Shang]] prepare to marry but are distracted by a task from the Emperor, who wants his three daughters escorted to their own marriage ceremony. Their romantic relationship becomes somewhat strained during the trip, as the romantic couple has differing views on various issues. Meanwhile, [[Mushu]] realizes that if Mulan marries Shang, she will not need him anymore as her [[Tutelary deity|guardian spirit]], and decides to trick the two into breaking up. When bandits attack, Mulan and Shang fight them off, but Mulan is devastated when Shang is seemingly killed trying to save her. To make sure the three princesses are not forced to marry against their will, Mulan takes their place marrying the eldest son of the ruler of the neighboring land. Shang survives the accident and arrives in time to stop the wedding but ultimately Mulan is saved by Mushu who, posing as the mighty Golden Dragon of Unity, frees the three princesses from their vows, and marries Mulan and Li Shang himself causing Mulan to forgive him for his actions. Afterwards, Mulan informs Li Shang of Mushu's existence and he combines the temples of his family and hers, allowing Mushu to keep his position.\n\n====''Ralph Breaks the Internet''====\nMulan, alongside other Disney Princesses, appeared in the film ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'', as was announced at the 2017 D23 Expo.<ref>http://www.slashfilm.com/wreck-it-ralph-2-brings-disney-princesses-together-with-marvel-star-wars-d23-expo-2017/</ref>\n\n==== Live-action film ====\n[[Liu Yifei]] is set to portray Mulan in a [[Mulan (2020 film)|live-action adaptation]] of the 1998 animated film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disneys-mulan-finds-star-1061585 |title=Disney's 'Mulan' Finds Its Star (Exclusive) |first1=Rebecca |last1=Sun |first2=Rebecca |last2=Ford |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 29, 2017 |accessdate=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Disney Princess'' franchise ===\nMulan is the eighth official member the [[Disney Princess]] franchise,<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/how-fantasy-becomes-reality/200912/first-black-disney-princess-debuts-70-years-after-snow-white|title = First Black Disney Princess Debuts, 70+ years after Snow White|website = Psychology Today|date = December 4, 2009|accessdate = March 10, 2014|last = Dill|first = Karen E.}}</ref> a [[media franchise]] marketed towards young girls.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/24/magazine/24princess.t.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&|title = What's Wrong With Cinderella?|date = December 24, 2006|website = The New York Times|accessdate = March 4, 2014|last = Orestein|first = Peggy}}</ref> For children, Mulan demonstrates the positive aspects of never giving up, not being restricted to gender roles and the importance of family and honor.

Her speaking voice is provided by actress [[Ming-Na Wen]], while singer [[Lea Salonga]] provides the character's singing voice. Created by author [[Robert D. San Souci]], Mulan is based on the legendary Chinese warrior [[Hua Mulan]] from the poem the ''[[Ballad of Mulan]]''. The only [[child]] of an aging [[war veteran]], Mulan disregards both tradition and the law by disguising herself as a man in order to enlist herself in the army in lieu of her feeble father.\n\nDisney had originally conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman who ultimately [[Elopement|elopes]] to Europe to be with a British prince. However, director [[Tony Bancroft]], who was inspired by the well-being of his own daughters, wanted Mulan to be a different, unique kind of Disney heroine \u2013 one who is strong and independent, whose fate does not depend upon a male character. Thus, the relationship between Mulan and [[Li Shang (Mulan character)|Captain Li Shang]] was relegated to that of a minor [[subplot]], while Mulan's bravery and strength were emphasized in order to ensure that she remained the hero of her own story. Mulan's supervising animator was [[Mark Henn]], who deliberately designed the character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors.\n\nReception towards Mulan's personality has been generally positive, with critics praising her bravery and heroism. However, some commentators have accused Disney of [[Westernization|Westernizing]] the character,{{who|date=March 2020}} while her romantic relationship with Shang has been widely accused of compromising Mulan's heroism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Both Wen and Salonga have been awarded [[Disney Legends]] for their contributions to the role.

The Chinese emperor orders that the army protect his citizens over himself, general mobilization, issuing a conscription that one man from each family to join the Chinese army. After Mulan's meeting with the matchmaker goes horribly awry, Chi Fu arrives at her home to enlist her father. Although she protests knowing her veteran father can not survive another war, Mulan is silenced by both Chi Fu and her father. That evening, Mulan takes her father's old armor and disguises herself as a boy named Ping, enlisting in the army on his behalf. Upon learning of Mulan's departure, the ancestors order the small dragon Mushu, a disgraced former guardian, to awaken the  \"great stone dragon\" so that he may retrieve Mulan, only for Mushu to destroy the statue. Mushu decides to join Mulan in the army and help train her in the hopes that the ancestors will crown him a guardian once again.\n\nReporting to the training camp, Mulan is able to pass as a man, although her military skills are initially lacking. Mushu provides clumsy guidance to Mulan on how to behave like a man. Under the command of Captain Li Shang, she and her fellow recruits Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, gradually become trained warriors. Desiring to see Mulan succeed, Mushu creates a fake order from Shang's father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main imperial army into the mountains. The reinforcements set out, but arrive at a burnt-out encampment, where they discover that General Li and his troops have been massacred by the Huns.\n\nAs the reinforcements solemnly leave the mountains, they are ambushed by the Huns, but Mulan cleverly uses a cannon to cause an avalanche, which buries most of the invaders. An enraged Shan Yu slashes her in the chest, and after the avalanche subsides, her deception is revealed when the wound is bandaged.\n\nInstead of executing Mulan as the law requires, Shang spares her life, but nonetheless expels her from the army. Mulan is left to follow alone as the recruits depart for the imperial city to report the news of the Huns' destruction. However, it is discovered that several Hun warriors, including Shan Yu, have survived the avalanche, and Mulan catches sight of them as they make their way to the city, intent on capturing the emperor.\n\nAt the imperial city, Mulan is unable to convince Shang about Shan Yu's survival; the Huns capture the emperor, and seize the palace. With Mulan's help, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po pose as concubines, and are able to enter the palace. With the help of Shang, they defeat Shan Yu's men; as Shang prevents Shan Yu from assassinating the Emperor, Mulan lures the Hun leader onto the roof, where she engages him in single combat. Meanwhile, acting on Mulan's instructions and signal, Mushu fires a large skyrocket at Shan Yu. The rocket strikes, and propels him into a fireworks launching tower, where he dies in the resulting explosion.\n\nMulan is praised by the Emperor and the assembled inhabitants of the city, who bow to her in an unprecedented honor. While she accepts the crest of the Emperor, and the sword of Shan Yu as gifts, she politely declines his offer to be his advisor, and asks to return to her family.\n\nMulan returns home, where she presents these gifts to her father, who is overjoyed to have Mulan back safely. Having become enamored with Mulan, Shang soon arrives under the pretext of returning her helmet, but accepts the family's invitation to stay for dinner. Mushu is reinstated as a Fa family guardian by the ancestors amid a returning celebration. When Mulan thanks Mushu, she kisses him on the forehead, followed by her dog, Little Brother, and a herd of chickens bursting into the Temple, with a Great Ancestor calling Mushu's name, ending the film.\n\n====''Mulan II''====\n{{Main|Mulan II}}\nOne whole month after the events of the original movie, Mulan and [[Li Shang (Mulan character)|Li Shang]] prepare to marry but are distracted by a task from the Emperor, who wants his three daughters escorted to their own marriage ceremony. Their romantic relationship becomes somewhat strained during the trip, as the romantic couple has differing views on various issues. Meanwhile, [[Mushu]] realizes that if Mulan marries Shang, she will not need him anymore as her [[Tutelary deity|guardian spirit]], and decides to trick the two into breaking up. When bandits attack, Mulan and Shang fight them off, but Mulan is devastated when Shang is seemingly killed trying to save her. To make sure the three princesses are not forced to marry against their will, Mulan takes their place marrying the eldest son of the ruler of the neighboring land. Shang survives the accident and arrives in time to stop the wedding but ultimately Mulan is saved by Mushu who, posing as the mighty Golden Dragon of Unity, frees the three princesses from their vows, and marries Mulan and Li Shang himself causing Mulan to forgive him for his actions. Afterwards, Mulan informs Li Shang of Mushu's existence and he combines the temples of his family and hers, allowing Mushu to keep his position.\n\n====''Ralph Breaks the Internet''====\nMulan, alongside other Disney Princesses, appeared in the film ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'', as was announced at the 2017 D23 Expo.<ref>http://www.slashfilm.com/wreck-it-ralph-2-brings-disney-princesses-together-with-marvel-star-wars-d23-expo-2017/</ref>\n\n==== Live-action film ====\n[[Liu Yifei]] is set to portray Mulan in a [[Mulan (2020 film)|live-action adaptation]] of the 1998 animated film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disneys-mulan-finds-star-1061585 |title=Disney's 'Mulan' Finds Its Star (Exclusive) |first1=Rebecca |last1=Sun |first2=Rebecca |last2=Ford |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 29, 2017 |accessdate=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Disney Princess'' franchise ===\nMulan is the eighth official member the [[Disney Princess]] franchise,<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/how-fantasy-becomes-reality/200912/first-black-disney-princess-debuts-70-years-after-snow-white|title = First Black Disney Princess Debuts, 70+ years after Snow White|website = Psychology Today|date = December 4, 2009|accessdate = March 10, 2014|last = Dill|first = Karen E.}}</ref> a [[media franchise]] marketed towards young girls.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/24/magazine/24princess.t.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&|title = What's Wrong With Cinderella?|date = December 24, 2006|website = The New York Times|accessdate = March 4, 2014|last = Orestein|first = Peggy}}</ref> For children, Mulan demonstrates the positive aspects of never giving up, not being restricted to gender roles and the importance of family and honor.

Her new appearance has caused an uproar due to the [[whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]] of her character. This was particularly troubling as Mulan is one of the few princesses of color.{{who|date=March 2020}}<!--Who says this?--> Shavon L. McKinstry of ''SPARK Movement'' writes that Mulan's redesign \"seem to be directly counter to her personality and character in her film\", and also notes how all the princesses of color have been \"noticeably pushed to the back or left out completely\" from the new Disney merchandise which featured the redesigns.<ref name=\"multiple\">McKinstry, Shavon L.

The study revealed that in the group of girls ranging from 3 to 6 years old, 30.6% of the group would change their physical appearance if they could. Of these respondents, over half would change their hair and over a quarter would change something about their body, such as skin color. Of all girls surveyed, 8% said they would have to change their hair or skin color to become a princess, stating things like they would \"change from brown skin to white skin\", for example.
