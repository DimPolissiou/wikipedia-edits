Maize diversity in Mexico continues to be maintained and managed by smallholder farmers who participate in traditional seed sharing networks. Maize landraces in Mexico are conserved in place, or in-situ, by farmers who continue to grow them in their fields. Commercial maize seed is planted on less than one-fourth of Mexico\u2019s 8 million hectares of arable land<ref name=\":9\" />. The majority of farmers in Mexico use, save, and exchange the seed of traditional maize landraces along with \u201ccreolized\u201d (hybridized or cross-pollinated) commercial [[Cultivar|cultivars]], which are typically planted in small (<5 ha) rain-fed fields<ref name=\":9\" />. \n\nAn estimated 18 percent of maize cultivation in Mexico takes place in the highlands, and maize agro-climates in the highland regions are most at risk from climate change.<ref name=\":4\" /> Many scientists are concerned about the effects climate change poses on maize genetic diversity and the negative impacts that continued maize [[germplasm]] loss will have, not only on Mexican agriculture, but worldwide, as maize is the most widely grown crop in the world.<ref name=\":7\" /> Bellon et al. (2011) discuss the need to strengthen and broaden traditional seed networks in Mexico to support farmers and the genetic integrity of maize in light of climate change; thus, extending the geographic ranges of seed networks to link farmers in the highlands, for example, with farmers in mid-altitude environments.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Coffee ====\nVariable and extreme climatic events such as droughts, floods, and excessive heat will have \u2013 and is already having - important impacts on both the quality and overall production of [[Coffee bean|coffee]] in Mexico.<ref name=\":3\" /> In Mexico and Central America more broadly, some 8.5 million people rely on coffee production for their livelihoods.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2012, higher than average temperatures and high-altitude rains led to an outbreak of [[Hemileia vastatrix|coffee leaf rust]], affecting roughly 50 percent of the coffee crop in Central America.<ref name=\":2\" /> This resulted in $500 million in crop damages to the region and caused many people in the region to lose their livelihoods.<ref name=\":2\" /> Regional studies in Mexico have projected that coffee growing could be unviable by the end of the decade.<ref name=\":3\" /> Responses will need to occur both in the social and ecological realms and across multiple scales. Key strategies include crop diversification and the implementation of more resilient coffee production systems. Farmer education, access to information, health, and equity factors all play important roles in adaptation responses as well.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Yet, there are also large-scale and global factors at play, such as international trade markets, which are often volatile, that are beyond farmers\u2019 control. A handful of coffee companies, NGOs, and agencies have initiated training and education programs for Mexican farmers to better respond to climate change.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Global Impacts ===\nClimate change threatens not only food and economic security in Mexico, but is also tied to much larger, global processes. In 2017, the United States imported $13.3 billion of fruits and vegetables from Mexico.<ref name=\":6\" /> Declining crop yields in Mexico due to climate change will ultimately impact global trade networks, national economies, and food security in countries that are, perhaps, geographically distant; yet through free-trade policies such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] and [[United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement|USMCA]], have become highly dependent on Mexican agriculture.\n\n=== Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies ===\nThe Mexican government\u2019s climate change program explicitly identifies \u201cthe adoption and implementation of sustainable agriculture\u201d as a key adaptation strategy<ref name=\":9\" />. Sustainable agriculture can take many forms. One type of strategy that has been proposed includes changing farmers\u2019 agricultural practices. For example, changing the timing of irrigation and crop planting, introducing new landraces and cultivars by extending seed-sharing networks, and adopting biodiversity friendly farming practices that increase [[agroecosystem]] resilience<ref name=\":9\" />. Evidence suggests that smallholder farmers in southern Mexico have begun adapting their agricultural practices due to climate change, by, for example, delaying crop plantings and planting a diversity of landrace varieties<ref name=\":9\" />. Another strategy focuses on the development and promotion of new, [[Genetically modified plant|transgenic]], \u201cclimate-adapted\u201d seed varieties that have traits for drought- and disease-resistance<ref name=\":9\" />. Researchers have also noted the importance of state leadership in addressing climate change by, for example, training and preparing farmers for climate adaptation<ref name=\":9\" />. However, implementation of any adaptation or mitigation strategy will need to take into account the complexity of [[Coupled human\u2013environment system|coupled human-natural systems]], wealth and power inequities, and the varying scales at which climate change processes are occurring<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eakin, H., Lerner, A., Murinho, F.|date=2010|title=Adaptive capacity in evolving peri-urban spaces: responses to flood risk in the Upper Lerma River Valley, Mexico|url=|journal=Global Environmental Change|volume=20|pages=14\u201322|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.08.005}}</ref><ref name=\":9\" />.\n[[File:A shade-grown coffee plot helps protect water quality, provides higher yields, reduces irrigation, and even provides wildlife habitat.jpg|thumb|Much of Mexico's coffee (Coffee arabica) production is grown under the shade of a diversity of tree species.

Maize diversity in Mexico continues to be maintained and managed by smallholder farmers who participate in traditional seed sharing networks. Maize landraces in Mexico are conserved in place, or in-situ, by farmers who continue to grow them in their fields. Commercial maize seed is planted on less than one-fourth of Mexico\u2019s 8 million hectares of arable land<ref name=\":9\" />. The majority of farmers in Mexico use, save, and exchange the seed of traditional maize landraces along with \u201ccreolized\u201d (hybridized or cross-pollinated) commercial [[Cultivar|cultivars]], which are typically planted in small (<5 ha) rain-fed fields<ref name=\":9\" />. \n\nAn estimated 18 percent of maize cultivation in Mexico takes place in the highlands, and maize agro-climates in the highland regions are most at risk from climate change.<ref name=\":4\" /> Many scientists are concerned about the effects climate change poses on maize genetic diversity and the negative impacts that continued maize [[germplasm]] loss will have, not only on Mexican agriculture, but worldwide, as maize is the most widely grown crop in the world.<ref name=\":7\" /> Bellon et al.

Key strategies include crop diversification and the implementation of more resilient coffee production systems. Farmer education, access to information, health, and equity factors all play important roles in adaptation responses as well.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Yet, there are also large-scale and global factors at play, such as international trade markets, which are often volatile, that are beyond farmers\u2019 control. A handful of coffee companies, NGOs, and agencies have initiated training and education programs for Mexican farmers to better respond to climate change.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Global Impacts ===\nClimate change threatens not only food and economic security in Mexico, but is also tied to much larger, global processes. In 2017, the United States imported $13.3 billion of fruits and vegetables from Mexico.<ref name=\":6\" /> Declining crop yields in Mexico due to climate change will ultimately impact global trade networks, national economies, and food security in countries that are, perhaps, geographically distant; yet through free-trade policies such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] and [[United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement|USMCA]], have become highly dependent on Mexican agriculture.\n\n=== Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies ===\nThe Mexican government\u2019s climate change program explicitly identifies \u201cthe adoption and implementation of sustainable agriculture\u201d as a key adaptation strategy<ref name=\":9\" />. Sustainable agriculture can take many forms. One type of strategy that has been proposed includes changing farmers\u2019 agricultural practices. For example, changing the timing of irrigation and crop planting, introducing new landraces and cultivars by extending seed-sharing networks, and adopting biodiversity friendly farming practices that increase [[agroecosystem]] resilience<ref name=\":9\" />. Evidence suggests that smallholder farmers in southern Mexico have begun adapting their agricultural practices due to climate change, by, for example, delaying crop plantings and planting a diversity of landrace varieties<ref name=\":9\" />. Another strategy focuses on the development and promotion of new, [[Genetically modified plant|transgenic]], \u201cclimate-adapted\u201d seed varieties that have traits for drought- and disease-resistance<ref name=\":9\" />. Researchers have also noted the importance of state leadership in addressing climate change by, for example, training and preparing farmers for climate adaptation<ref name=\":9\" />.

It is a member of the [[Mustelidae|mustelid]] family (commonly referred to as the [[weasel]] family), and is in the monospecific genus '''''Pekania'''''. The fisher is closely related to, but larger than, the [[American marten]] (''Martes americana''). The fisher is a forest-dwelling creature whose range covers much of the [[taiga|boreal forest]] in [[Canada]] to the northern United States. Names derived from [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aboriginal]] languages include ''pekan'', ''pequam'', ''wejack'', and ''woolang''. It is sometimes misleadingly referred to as a '''fisher cat''', although it is not a [[Felidae|cat]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.massaudubon.org/learn/nature-wildlife/mammals/fishers/about|title=About Fishers|website=Mass Audubon|language=en|access-date=2018-09-02}}</ref>\n\nMales and females look similar. Adult males are {{Convert|90|to(-)|120|cm|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{Convert|3.5|to(-)|6.0|kg|0}}. Adult females are {{Convert|75|to(-)|95|cm|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{Convert|2.0|to(-)|2.5|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The fur of the fisher varies seasonally, being denser and glossier in the winter. During the summer, the color becomes more mottled, as the fur goes through a [[moulting]] cycle. The fisher prefers to hunt in full forest. Although an agile climber, it spends most of its time on the forest floor, where it prefers to forage around fallen trees. An [[omnivore]], the fisher feeds on a wide variety of small animals and occasionally on fruits and mushrooms. It prefers the [[snowshoe hare]] and is one of the few animals able to prey successfully on [[North American porcupine|porcupines]]. Despite its common name, it rarely eats fish.\n\nThe reproductive cycle of the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers give birth to a litter of three or four kits in the spring. They nurse and care for their kits until late summer, when they are old enough to set out on their own. Females enter [[estrous cycle|estrus]] shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the [[blastocyst]] is [[Embryonic diapause|delayed]] until the following spring, when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.\n\nFishers have few predators besides humans. They have been [[Trapping|trapped]] since the 18th century for their fur. Their pelts were in such demand that they were [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from several parts of the United States in the early part of the 20th century. Conservation and protection measures have allowed the species to rebound, but their current range is still reduced from its historic limits. In the 1920s, when pelt prices were high, some [[fur farming|fur farmers]] attempted to raise fishers. However, their unusual delayed reproduction made breeding difficult. When pelt prices fell in the late 1940s, most fisher farming ended. While fishers usually avoid human contact, encroachments into forest habitats have resulted in some conflicts.\n\n== Etymology ==\nDespite the name \"fisher\", the animal is not known to eat fish. The name is instead related to the word \"fitch\", meaning a [[European polecat]] (''Mustela putorius'') or pelt thereof, due to the resemblance to that animal. The name comes from colonial Dutch equivalent ''fisse'' or ''visse''. In the French language, the pelt of a polecat is also called ''fiche'' or ''fichet''.<ref name=\"Powell1\">{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=R.A.|date=May 8, 1981|journal=Mammalian Species|title=''Martes pennanti''|publisher=The American Society of Mammalogists|issue=156|pages=1\u20136|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-156-01-0001.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051030114348/http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-156-01-0001.pdf|archive-date=2005-10-30|accessdate=October 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn some regions, the fisher is known as a ''pekan'', derived from its name in the [[Abenaki language]].

[[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] had first described the creature in 1765, calling it a ''pekan''. Pennant examined the same specimen, but called it a fisher, unaware of Buffon's earlier description. Other 18th-century scientists gave it similar names, such as [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber|Schreber]], who named it ''Mustela canadensis'', and [[Pieter Boddaert|Boddaert]], who named it ''Mustela melanorhyncha''.<ref>Coues, p. 66.</ref> The fisher was eventually placed in the genus ''Martes'' by Smith in 1843.<ref>Powell, pp. 11\u201312.</ref> In 2008, advances in DNA analysis allowed a more detailed study of the fisher's evolutionary history. The fisher and the genus ''Martes'' were determined to have [[Paraphyly|descended from a common ancestor]], but the fisher was distinct enough to put it in [[Monophyly|its own genus]]. It was decided to create the genus ''Pekania'' and reclassify the fisher as ''Pekania pennanti''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Multigene phylogeny of the Mustelidae: Resolving relationships, tempo and biogeographic history of a mammalian adaptive radiation |first1=Klaus-Peter |last1=Koepfli |first2=Kerry A |last2=Deere |first3=Graham J |last3=Slater |first4=Colleen |last4=Begg |first5=Keith |last5=Begg |first6=Lon |last6=Grassman |first7=Mauro |last7=Lucherini |first8=Geraldine |last8=Veron |first9=Robert K |last9=Wayne |journal=BMC Biology |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=10 |date=February 14, 2008|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-6-10 |pmid=18275614 |pmc=2276185 }}</ref>\n\nMembers of the genus ''Pekania'' are distinguished by their four premolar teeth on the upper and lower jaws. Its close relative ''Mustela'' has just three. The fisher has 38 teeth. The [[dentition]] formula is: {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.4.1|lower=2.1.4.2}}<ref>Powell, p. 12.</ref>\n\n=== Evolution ===\nSome evidence shows that ancestors of the fisher migrated to North America during the [[Pliocene]] era between 2.5 and 5.0 million years ago. Two extinct mustelids, ''M. palaeosinensis'' and ''M. anderssoni'', have been found in eastern Asia. The first true fisher, ''M. diluviana'', has only been found in [[Middle Pleistocene]] North America. ''M. diluviana'' is strongly indicated to be related to the Asian finds, which suggests a migration. ''M. pennanti'' has been found as early as the [[Late Pleistocene]] era, about 125,000 years ago. No major differences are seen between the Pleistocene fisher and the modern fisher. Fossil evidence indicates that the fisher's range extended farther south than it does today.<ref name=\"Powell1\" />\n\nThree [[subspecies]] were identified by Goldman in 1935, ''M. p. columbiana'', ''M. p. pacifica'', and ''M. p. pennanti''. Later research has debated whether these subspecies could be positively identified. In 1959, E.M. Hagmeier concluded that the subspecies are not separable based on either fur or skull characteristics. Although some debate still exists, in general, the fisher is recognized to be a [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] species with no extant subspecies.<ref>Powell, p. 14.</ref>\n\n== Biology and behavior ==\n\n=== Physical characteristics ===\n[[File:Fisher-face-snow - West Virginia - ForestWander.jpg|thumb|Fisher in winter coat]]\nFishers are a medium-sized mammal, comparable in size to the domestic [[cat]]. Their bodies are long, thin, and low to the ground. The sexes have similar physical features, but they are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] in size, with the male being much larger than the female. Males are {{Convert|90|to(-)|120|cm|abbr=on}} in length and weigh {{Convert|3.5|to(-)|6.0|kg|0|abbr=on}}.

Males have coarser coats than females. In the early winter, the coats are dense and glossy, ranging from {{Convert|30|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the chest to {{Convert|70|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the back. The color ranges from deep brown to black, although it appears to be much blacker in the winter when contrasted with white snow. From the face to the shoulders, fur can be hoary-gold or silver due to tricolored guard hairs. The underside of a fisher is almost completely brown except for randomly placed patches of white or cream-colored fur. In the summer, the fur color is more variable and may lighten considerably. Fishers undergo [[moulting]] starting in late summer and finishing by November or December.<ref>Powell, pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\nFishers have five toes on each foot, with unsheathed, retractable claws.<ref name=\"Powell1\" /> Their feet are large, making it easier for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, four central pads are on each foot. On the hind paws are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on slippery surfaces.<ref name=\"Powell, p. 9\">Powell, p. 9.</ref> Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180\u00b0, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first.<ref>Fergus, p. 101.</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nations |first1=Johnathan A.|last2=Link |first2=Olson |title=Scansoriality in Mammals |url=http://animaldiversity.org/collections/scansoriality-in-mammals/ |website=Animal Diversity Web}}</ref> The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.<ref>{{cite book |author=Alexander, R.

Since these patches become enlarged during breeding season, they are likely used to make a scent trail to allow fishers to find each other so they can mate.<ref name=\"Powell, p. 9\" />\n\n=== Hunting and diet ===\nFishers are generalist predators. Although their primary prey is [[snowshoe hare]]s and [[North American porcupine|porcupine]]s, they are also known to supplement their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even deer\u2014the latter two indicating that they are not averse to eating [[carrion]]. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses.<ref>Fergus, p. 102.</ref> While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as [[wild turkey]], [[bobcat]] (although, in most cases, confrontations tend to be dominated by the cat, that frequently prey on them and in fact is one of their main predators) and [[Canadian lynx]].<ref name=\"olympia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/olympia/wet/team-research/for-carnivor/aubryandraley-fisher-report-july2006.pdf |title=Ecological Characteristics of Fishers in the Southern Oregon Cascade Range |publisher=USDA Forest Service \u2013 Pacific Northwest Research Station 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"vashon\">{{cite web |first1=Jennifer |last1=Vashon |first2=Adam |last2=Vashon |first3=Shannon |last3=Crowley |url=http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/mammals/lynx/Maine's%20Annual%20Field%20Report%202002.pdf |title=Partnership for Lynx Conservation in Main December 2001 \u2013 December 2002 Field Report |publisher=Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife |page=9}}</ref><ref name=\"pressherald\">{{cite news |first=John |last=Richardson |url=http://www.pressherald.com/archive/researchers-collect-data-to-track-health-of-threats-to-canada-lynx_2008-03-04.html |title=Researchers collect data to track health of, threats to Canada lynx |work=The Portland Press Herald |publisher=Pressherald.com |date=March 17, 2010 |accessdate=December 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114003536/http://www.pressherald.com/archive/researchers-collect-data-to-track-health-of-threats-to-canada-lynx_2008-03-04.html |archivedate=November 14, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Researchers in [[Maine]] have found \"about a dozen\" cases of confirmed fisher predation on [[Canadian lynx]], and several more suspected cases, in a four township area of Maine.<ref name=\"nationalgeographic.com\">{{cite web|title=Small Weasel-Like Animals Are Taking Down Big Cats|author=Joshua Rapp Learn|date=September 28, 2018|work=National Geographic|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/09/Weasel-like-fishers-prey-on-Canada-Lynx-in-Maine-news/|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref> According to [[Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife]] wildlife biologist Scott McClellan, the fishers involved in these kills attacked lynxs bedded down in snowstorms with a quick \"powerful grip\" bite to the lynx's neck.<ref name=\"nationalgeographic.com\"/> Signs of struggle indicated that some lynxs attempted to defend themselves but McClellan states that \"the fishers would finish the cats off pretty quickly.

Kits are completely dependent on their mother's milk for the first eight to ten weeks, after which they begin to switch to a solid diet. After four months, kits become intolerant of their litter mates, and at five months, the mother pushes them out on their own. After one year, juveniles will have established their own range.<ref name=\"Feldhamer, pp. 638-9\" />\n\n=== Social structure and home range ===\nFishers are generally [[Crepuscular animal|crepuscular]], being most active at dawn and dusk. They are active year-round, and are solitary, associating with other fishers only for mating. Males become more active during mating season. Females are least active during pregnancy and gradually increase activity after birth of their kits.<ref name=\"Feldhamer, pp. 638-9\" />\n\nA fisher's hunting range varies from {{Convert|6.6|km2|0|abbr=on}} in the summer to {{Convert|14.1|km2|0|abbr=on}} in the winter. Ranges up to {{Convert|20.0|km2|0|abbr=on}} in the winter are possible depending on the quality of the habitat. Male and female fishers have overlapping territories.

A combination of [[forest regrowth]] in abandoned farmlands and improved forest management practices increased available habitat and allowed remnant populations to recover. Populations have since recovered sufficiently that the species is no longer endangered. Increasing forest cover in eastern North America means that fisher populations will remain sufficiently robust for the near future. Between 1955 and 1985, some states had allowed limited trapping to resume. In areas where fishers were eliminated, porcupine populations subsequently increased. Areas with a high density of porcupines were found to have extensive damage to timber crops. In these cases, fishers were reintroduced by releasing adults relocated from other places into the forest. Once the fisher populations became re-established, porcupine numbers returned to natural levels.<ref>Powell, pp. 77\u201380.</ref> In Washington, fisher sightings were reported into the 1980s, but an extensive survey in the 1990s did not locate any.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/endangered/species/fisher.pdf|title=Threatened and Endangered Wildlife in Washington: 2012 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329053609/http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/endangered/species/fisher.pdf|archive-date=March 29, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nScattered fisher populations now exist in the Pacific Northwest.

They have been popular with trappers due to the value of their fur, which has been used for scarves and neck pieces. It is reported that fisher tails were used in the making of [[spodik]]s, a form of ceremonial hat worn by Jews of certain [[Hasidic]] sects.\n\nThe best pelts are from winter trapping, with secondary-quality pelts from spring trapping. The lowest-quality furs come from out-of-season trapping when fishers are moulting. They are easily trapped, and the value of their fur was a particular incentive for catching this species.<ref>Hodgson, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nPrices for pelts have varied considerably over the past 100 years. They were highest in the 1920s and 1930s, when average prices were about US$100.<ref name=\"Powell1\"/> In 1936, pelts were being offered for sale in New York City for $450\u2013750 per pelt.<ref name=\"Hodgson, pp. 97\u201398\">Hodgson, pp. 97\u201398.</ref> Prices declined through the 1960s, but picked up again in the late 1970s. In 1979, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] paid $410 for one female pelt.<ref name=\"Hodgson, pp. 97\u201398\" /> In 1999, 16,638 pelts were sold in Canada for C$449,307 at an average price of $27.<ref name=\"statscan\">{{cite report|title=Fur Statistics |author=Statistics Canada. Agriculture Division |year=2008}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1900 and 1940, fishers were threatened with near extinction in the southern part of their range due to overtrapping and alterations to their habitat. In New England, fishers, along with most other furbearers, were nearly exterminated due to unregulated trapping. Fishers became extirpated in many northern U.S. states after 1930, but were still abundant enough in Canada to maintain a harvest over 3,000 fishers per year. Limited protection was afforded in the early 20th century, but total protection was not given to the few remaining fishers until 1934. Closed seasons, habitat recovery, and reintroductions have restored fishers to much of their original range.<ref name=\"Powell1\" />\n\nTrapping resumed in the U.S. after 1962, once numbers had recovered sufficiently. During the early 1970s, the value of fisher pelts soared, leading to another population crash in 1976. After a few years of closed seasons, fisher trapping reopened in 1979 with a shortened season and restricted bag limits. The population has steadily increased since then, with steadily increasing numbers of trapped animals, despite a much lower pelt value.<ref name=\"novak\" />\n\n=== Captivity ===\n[[File:Martes pennanti (Fisher) fur-skin.jpg|left|thumb|Fisher fur pelt (dyed)]]\nFishers have been captured live for [[fur farming]], zoo specimens, and scientific research. From 1920\u20131946, pelt prices averaged about C$137. Since pelts were relatively valuable, attempts were made to raise fishers on farms. Fur farming was popular with other species such as [[mink]] and [[stoat|ermine]], so the same techniques were thought to be applicable to fishers. However, farmers found it difficult to raise fishers due to their unusual reproductive cycle. In general, knowledge of delayed implantation in fishers was unknown at the time. Farmers noted that females mated in the spring but did not give birth. Due to declining pelt prices, most fisher farms closed operations by the late 1940s.<ref>Hodgson, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\n\nFishers have also been captured and bred by zoos, but they are not a common zoo species. Fishers are poor animals to exhibit because, in general, they hide from visitors all day. Some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity.<ref>Powell, pp. 207\u20138.</ref> Yet at least one example shows a fisher kept in captivity that lived to be 10 years old, and another living to be about 14 years old,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.times-standard.com/general-news/20160901/feds-issue-notice-after-pacific-fisher-dies-at-hsu?source=topstoriesrot|title=Feds issue notice after Pacific fisher dies at HSU|work=times-standard.com|date=September 2, 2016}}</ref> well beyond its natural lifespan of 7 years.<ref name=\"zoosoc\">{{cite report|author=New York Zoological Society |title=Bronx Zoo |year=1971}}</ref><ref name=\"Defenders\">{{cite web |title=Basic Facts About Fishers |url=http://www.defenders.org/fisher/basic-facts-about-fishers |website=Defenders of Wildlife |accessdate=June 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, R.A. Powell raised two fisher kits for the purpose of performing scientific research. His primary interest was an attempt to measure the activity of fishers to determine how much food the animals required to function. He did this by running them through treadmill exercises that simulated activity in the wild. He compared this to their food intake and used the data to estimate daily food requirements. The research lasted for two years. After one year, one of the fishers died due to unknown causes. The second was released back into the wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.<ref>Powell, pp. xi\u2013xv.</ref>\n\n=== Interactions with domestic animals ===\n[[File:Fisher 005.jpg|thumb|left|Fisher raiding a farmer's duck coop]]\n\nIn some areas, fishers can become pests to farmers when they raid chicken coops.

It is a member of the [[Mustelidae|mustelid]] family (commonly referred to as the [[weasel]] family), and is in the monospecific genus '''''Pekania'''''. The fisher is closely related to, but larger than, the [[American marten]] (''Martes americana''). The fisher is a forest-dwelling creature whose range covers much of the [[taiga|boreal forest]] in [[Canada]] to the northern United States. Names derived from [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aboriginal]] languages include ''pekan'', ''pequam'', ''wejack'', and ''woolang''. It is sometimes misleadingly referred to as a '''fisher cat''', although it is not a [[Felidae|cat]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.massaudubon.org/learn/nature-wildlife/mammals/fishers/about|title=About Fishers|website=Mass Audubon|language=en|access-date=2018-09-02}}</ref>\n\nMales and females look similar. Adult males are {{Convert|90|to(-)|120|cm|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{Convert|3.5|to(-)|6.0|kg|0}}. Adult females are {{Convert|75|to(-)|95|cm|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{Convert|2.0|to(-)|2.5|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The fur of the fisher varies seasonally, being denser and glossier in the winter. During the summer, the color becomes more mottled, as the fur goes through a [[moulting]] cycle. The fisher prefers to hunt in full forest. Although an agile climber, it spends most of its time on the forest floor, where it prefers to forage around fallen trees. An [[omnivore]], the fisher feeds on a wide variety of small animals and occasionally on fruits and mushrooms. It prefers the [[snowshoe hare]] and is one of the few animals able to prey successfully on [[North American porcupine|porcupines]]. Despite its common name, it rarely eats fish.\n\nThe reproductive cycle of the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers give birth to a litter of three or four kits in the spring. They nurse and care for their kits until late summer, when they are old enough to set out on their own. Females enter [[estrous cycle|estrus]] shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the [[blastocyst]] is [[Embryonic diapause|delayed]] until the following spring, when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.\n\nFishers have few predators besides humans. They have been [[Trapping|trapped]] since the 18th century for their fur. Their pelts were in such demand that they were [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from several parts of the United States in the early part of the 20th century. Conservation and protection measures have allowed the species to rebound, but their current range is still reduced from its historic limits. In the 1920s, when pelt prices were high, some [[fur farming|fur farmers]] attempted to raise fishers. However, their unusual delayed reproduction made breeding difficult. When pelt prices fell in the late 1940s, most fisher farming ended. While fishers usually avoid human contact, encroachments into forest habitats have resulted in some conflicts.\n\n== Etymology ==\nDespite the name \"fisher\", the animal is not known to eat fish. The name is instead related to the word \"fitch\", meaning a [[European polecat]] (''Mustela putorius'') or pelt thereof, due to the resemblance to that animal. The name comes from colonial Dutch equivalent ''fisse'' or ''visse''. In the French language, the pelt of a polecat is also called ''fiche'' or ''fichet''.<ref name=\"Powell1\">{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=R.A.|date=May 8, 1981|journal=Mammalian Species|title=''Martes pennanti''|publisher=The American Society of Mammalogists|issue=156|pages=1\u20136|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-156-01-0001.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051030114348/http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-156-01-0001.pdf|archive-date=2005-10-30|accessdate=October 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn some regions, the fisher is known as a ''pekan'', derived from its name in the [[Abenaki language]].

[[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] had first described the creature in 1765, calling it a ''pekan''. Pennant examined the same specimen, but called it a fisher, unaware of Buffon's earlier description. Other 18th-century scientists gave it similar names, such as [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber|Schreber]], who named it ''Mustela canadensis'', and [[Pieter Boddaert|Boddaert]], who named it ''Mustela melanorhyncha''.<ref>Coues, p. 66.</ref> The fisher was eventually placed in the genus ''Martes'' by Smith in 1843.<ref>Powell, pp. 11\u201312.</ref> In 2008, advances in DNA analysis allowed a more detailed study of the fisher's evolutionary history. The fisher and the genus ''Martes'' were determined to have [[Paraphyly|descended from a common ancestor]], but the fisher was distinct enough to put it in [[Monophyly|its own genus]]. It was decided to create the genus ''Pekania'' and reclassify the fisher as ''Pekania pennanti''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Multigene phylogeny of the Mustelidae: Resolving relationships, tempo and biogeographic history of a mammalian adaptive radiation |first1=Klaus-Peter |last1=Koepfli |first2=Kerry A |last2=Deere |first3=Graham J |last3=Slater |first4=Colleen |last4=Begg |first5=Keith |last5=Begg |first6=Lon |last6=Grassman |first7=Mauro |last7=Lucherini |first8=Geraldine |last8=Veron |first9=Robert K |last9=Wayne |journal=BMC Biology |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=10 |date=February 14, 2008|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-6-10 |pmid=18275614 |pmc=2276185 }}</ref>\n\nMembers of the genus ''Pekania'' are distinguished by their four premolar teeth on the upper and lower jaws. Its close relative ''Mustela'' has just three. The fisher has 38 teeth. The [[dentition]] formula is: {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.4.1|lower=2.1.4.2}}<ref>Powell, p. 12.</ref>\n\n=== Evolution ===\nSome evidence shows that ancestors of the fisher migrated to North America during the [[Pliocene]] era between 2.5 and 5.0 million years ago. Two extinct mustelids, ''M. palaeosinensis'' and ''M. anderssoni'', have been found in eastern Asia. The first true fisher, ''M. diluviana'', has only been found in [[Middle Pleistocene]] North America. ''M. diluviana'' is strongly indicated to be related to the Asian finds, which suggests a migration. ''M. pennanti'' has been found as early as the [[Late Pleistocene]] era, about 125,000 years ago. No major differences are seen between the Pleistocene fisher and the modern fisher. Fossil evidence indicates that the fisher's range extended farther south than it does today.<ref name=\"Powell1\" />\n\nThree [[subspecies]] were identified by Goldman in 1935, ''M. p. columbiana'', ''M. p. pacifica'', and ''M. p. pennanti''. Later research has debated whether these subspecies could be positively identified. In 1959, E.M. Hagmeier concluded that the subspecies are not separable based on either fur or skull characteristics. Although some debate still exists, in general, the fisher is recognized to be a [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] species with no extant subspecies.<ref>Powell, p. 14.</ref>\n\n== Biology and behavior ==\n\n=== Physical characteristics ===\n[[File:Fisher-face-snow - West Virginia - ForestWander.jpg|thumb|Fisher in winter coat]]\nFishers are a medium-sized mammal, comparable in size to the domestic [[cat]]. Their bodies are long, thin, and low to the ground. The sexes have similar physical features, but they are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] in size, with the male being much larger than the female. Males are {{Convert|90|to(-)|120|cm|abbr=on}} in length and weigh {{Convert|3.5|to(-)|6.0|kg|0|abbr=on}}.

Males have coarser coats than females. In the early winter, the coats are dense and glossy, ranging from {{Convert|30|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the chest to {{Convert|70|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the back. The color ranges from deep brown to black, although it appears to be much blacker in the winter when contrasted with white snow. From the face to the shoulders, fur can be hoary-gold or silver due to tricolored guard hairs. The underside of a fisher is almost completely brown except for randomly placed patches of white or cream-colored fur. In the summer, the fur color is more variable and may lighten considerably. Fishers undergo [[moulting]] starting in late summer and finishing by November or December.<ref>Powell, pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\nFishers have five toes on each foot, with unsheathed, retractable claws.<ref name=\"Powell1\" /> Their feet are large, making it easier for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, four central pads are on each foot. On the hind paws are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on slippery surfaces.<ref name=\"Powell, p. 9\">Powell, p. 9.</ref> Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180\u00b0, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first.<ref>Fergus, p. 101.</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nations |first1=Johnathan A.|last2=Link |first2=Olson |title=Scansoriality in Mammals |url=http://animaldiversity.org/collections/scansoriality-in-mammals/ |website=Animal Diversity Web}}</ref> The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.<ref>{{cite book |author=Alexander, R.

Since these patches become enlarged during breeding season, they are likely used to make a scent trail to allow fishers to find each other so they can mate.<ref name=\"Powell, p. 9\" />\n\n=== Hunting and diet ===\nFishers are generalist predators. Although their primary prey is [[snowshoe hare]]s and [[North American porcupine|porcupine]]s, they are also known to supplement their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even deer\u2014the latter two indicating that they are not averse to eating [[carrion]]. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses.<ref>Fergus, p. 102.</ref> While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as [[wild turkey]], [[bobcat]] (although, in most cases, confrontations tend to be dominated by the cat, that frequently prey on them and in fact is one of their main predators) and [[Canadian lynx]].<ref name=\"olympia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/olympia/wet/team-research/for-carnivor/aubryandraley-fisher-report-july2006.pdf |title=Ecological Characteristics of Fishers in the Southern Oregon Cascade Range |publisher=USDA Forest Service \u2013 Pacific Northwest Research Station 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"vashon\">{{cite web |first1=Jennifer |last1=Vashon |first2=Adam |last2=Vashon |first3=Shannon |last3=Crowley |url=http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/mammals/lynx/Maine's%20Annual%20Field%20Report%202002.pdf |title=Partnership for Lynx Conservation in Main December 2001 \u2013 December 2002 Field Report |publisher=Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife |page=9}}</ref><ref name=\"pressherald\">{{cite news |first=John |last=Richardson |url=http://www.pressherald.com/archive/researchers-collect-data-to-track-health-of-threats-to-canada-lynx_2008-03-04.html |title=Researchers collect data to track health of, threats to Canada lynx |work=The Portland Press Herald |publisher=Pressherald.com |date=March 17, 2010 |accessdate=December 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114003536/http://www.pressherald.com/archive/researchers-collect-data-to-track-health-of-threats-to-canada-lynx_2008-03-04.html |archivedate=November 14, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Researchers in [[Maine]] have found \"about a dozen\" cases of confirmed fisher predation on [[Canadian lynx]], and several more suspected cases, in a four township area of Maine.<ref name=\"nationalgeographic.com\">{{cite web|title=Small Weasel-Like Animals Are Taking Down Big Cats|author=Joshua Rapp Learn|date=September 28, 2018|work=National Geographic|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/09/Weasel-like-fishers-prey-on-Canada-Lynx-in-Maine-news/|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref> According to [[Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife]] wildlife biologist Scott McClellan, the fishers involved in these kills attacked lynxs bedded down in snowstorms with a quick \"powerful grip\" bite to the lynx's neck.<ref name=\"nationalgeographic.com\"/> Signs of struggle indicated that some lynxs attempted to defend themselves but McClellan states that \"the fishers would finish the cats off pretty quickly.

Kits are completely dependent on their mother's milk for the first eight to ten weeks, after which they begin to switch to a solid diet. After four months, kits become intolerant of their litter mates, and at five months, the mother pushes them out on their own. After one year, juveniles will have established their own range.<ref name=\"Feldhamer, pp. 638-9\" />\n\n=== Social structure and home range ===\nFishers are generally [[Crepuscular animal|crepuscular]], being most active at dawn and dusk. They are active year-round, and are solitary, associating with other fishers only for mating. Males become more active during mating season. Females are least active during pregnancy and gradually increase activity after birth of their kits.<ref name=\"Feldhamer, pp. 638-9\" />\n\nA fisher's hunting range varies from {{Convert|6.6|km2|0|abbr=on}} in the summer to {{Convert|14.1|km2|0|abbr=on}} in the winter. Ranges up to {{Convert|20.0|km2|0|abbr=on}} in the winter are possible depending on the quality of the habitat. Male and female fishers have overlapping territories.

They have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest, but are also common in mixed-hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and avoid areas with less than 50% coverage.<ref>Powell, p. 88.</ref> Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appear to be unsuitable for their needs.<ref>Powell, p. 92.</ref>\n\nFishers also select for forest floors with large amounts of [[coarse woody debris]].

A combination of [[forest regrowth]] in abandoned farmlands and improved forest management practices increased available habitat and allowed remnant populations to recover. Populations have since recovered sufficiently that the species is no longer endangered. Increasing forest cover in eastern North America means that fisher populations will remain sufficiently robust for the near future. Between 1955 and 1985, some states had allowed limited trapping to resume. In areas where fishers were eliminated, porcupine populations subsequently increased. Areas with a high density of porcupines were found to have extensive damage to timber crops. In these cases, fishers were reintroduced by releasing adults relocated from other places into the forest. Once the fisher populations became re-established, porcupine numbers returned to natural levels.<ref>Powell, pp. 77\u201380.</ref> In Washington, fisher sightings were reported into the 1980s, but an extensive survey in the 1990s did not locate any.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/endangered/species/fisher.pdf|title=Threatened and Endangered Wildlife in Washington: 2012 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329053609/http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/endangered/species/fisher.pdf|archive-date=March 29, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nScattered fisher populations now exist in the Pacific Northwest.

They have been popular with trappers due to the value of their fur, which has been used for scarves and neck pieces. It is reported that fisher tails were used in the making of [[spodik]]s, a form of ceremonial hat worn by Jews of certain [[Hasidic]] sects.\n\nThe best pelts are from winter trapping, with secondary-quality pelts from spring trapping. The lowest-quality furs come from out-of-season trapping when fishers are moulting. They are easily trapped, and the value of their fur was a particular incentive for catching this species.<ref>Hodgson, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nPrices for pelts have varied considerably over the past 100 years. They were highest in the 1920s and 1930s, when average prices were about US$100.<ref name=\"Powell1\"/> In 1936, pelts were being offered for sale in New York City for $450\u2013750 per pelt.<ref name=\"Hodgson, pp. 97\u201398\">Hodgson, pp. 97\u201398.</ref> Prices declined through the 1960s, but picked up again in the late 1970s. In 1979, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] paid $410 for one female pelt.<ref name=\"Hodgson, pp. 97\u201398\" /> In 1999, 16,638 pelts were sold in Canada for C$449,307 at an average price of $27.<ref name=\"statscan\">{{cite report|title=Fur Statistics |author=Statistics Canada. Agriculture Division |year=2008}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1900 and 1940, fishers were threatened with near extinction in the southern part of their range due to overtrapping and alterations to their habitat. In New England, fishers, along with most other furbearers, were nearly exterminated due to unregulated trapping. Fishers became extirpated in many northern U.S. states after 1930, but were still abundant enough in Canada to maintain a harvest over 3,000 fishers per year. Limited protection was afforded in the early 20th century, but total protection was not given to the few remaining fishers until 1934. Closed seasons, habitat recovery, and reintroductions have restored fishers to much of their original range.<ref name=\"Powell1\" />\n\nTrapping resumed in the U.S. after 1962, once numbers had recovered sufficiently. During the early 1970s, the value of fisher pelts soared, leading to another population crash in 1976. After a few years of closed seasons, fisher trapping reopened in 1979 with a shortened season and restricted bag limits. The population has steadily increased since then, with steadily increasing numbers of trapped animals, despite a much lower pelt value.<ref name=\"novak\" />\n\n=== Captivity ===\n[[File:Martes pennanti (Fisher) fur-skin.jpg|left|thumb|Fisher fur pelt (dyed)]]\nFishers have been captured live for [[fur farming]], zoo specimens, and scientific research. From 1920\u20131946, pelt prices averaged about C$137. Since pelts were relatively valuable, attempts were made to raise fishers on farms. Fur farming was popular with other species such as [[mink]] and [[stoat|ermine]], so the same techniques were thought to be applicable to fishers. However, farmers found it difficult to raise fishers due to their unusual reproductive cycle. In general, knowledge of delayed implantation in fishers was unknown at the time. Farmers noted that females mated in the spring but did not give birth. Due to declining pelt prices, most fisher farms closed operations by the late 1940s.<ref>Hodgson, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\n\nFishers have also been captured and bred by zoos, but they are not a common zoo species. Fishers are poor animals to exhibit because, in general, they hide from visitors all day. Some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity.<ref>Powell, pp. 207\u20138.</ref> Yet at least one example shows a fisher kept in captivity that lived to be 10 years old, and another living to be about 14 years old,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.times-standard.com/general-news/20160901/feds-issue-notice-after-pacific-fisher-dies-at-hsu?source=topstoriesrot|title=Feds issue notice after Pacific fisher dies at HSU|work=times-standard.com|date=September 2, 2016}}</ref> well beyond its natural lifespan of 7 years.<ref name=\"zoosoc\">{{cite report|author=New York Zoological Society |title=Bronx Zoo |year=1971}}</ref><ref name=\"Defenders\">{{cite web |title=Basic Facts About Fishers |url=http://www.defenders.org/fisher/basic-facts-about-fishers |website=Defenders of Wildlife |accessdate=June 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, R.A. Powell raised two fisher kits for the purpose of performing scientific research. His primary interest was an attempt to measure the activity of fishers to determine how much food the animals required to function. He did this by running them through treadmill exercises that simulated activity in the wild. He compared this to their food intake and used the data to estimate daily food requirements. The research lasted for two years. After one year, one of the fishers died due to unknown causes. The second was released back into the wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.<ref>Powell, pp. xi\u2013xv.</ref>\n\n=== Interactions with domestic animals ===\n[[File:Fisher 005.jpg|thumb|left|Fisher raiding a farmer's duck coop]]\n\nIn some areas, fishers can become pests to farmers when they raid chicken coops.

The team qualified for the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] for the first time in franchise history.\n{{TOClimit|limit=2}}\n\n==Offseason==\n\nForward [[Paul Kariya]] was named team captain, following the retirement of defenceman [[Randy Ladouceur]].\n\nThe Ducks only made one trade in the summer as the team looked good enough for the future following last season's late run, trading Mike Maneluk to the [[Ottawa Senators]] for [[Kevin Brown (ice hockey)|Kevin Brown]] on July 1st. Just before the season started Anaheim made another deal with Ottawa, trading [[Shaun Van Allen]] and [[Jason York]] in exchange for Ted Drury and [[Marc Moro]].\n\n==Regular season==\n\nThe previous season of 1995-96 the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had just narrowly missed the playoffs after being in the chase for the first time. The team put together a run of 12-4-3 over the final two months of the season to finish even with the Winnipeg Jets at 78 points in the standings, but the Jets earned the final spot thanks to having one more win.\n\nSo the Mighty Ducks start to the 96\u201397 season with a month of October that saw the team go 1-9-2 including an eight-game losing streak was a huge disappointment to say the least. Anaheim was held to two or fewer goals eight times during the stretch, and the two times they exploded for six goals in a game they ended up having to settle for a tie.\n\nWith all of four points through the first month, Anaheim was bottom of the Pacific Division and the Western Conference. The division-leading Colorado Avalanche were 11 points clear, and the Los Angeles Kings held the eighth and final playoff spot six point clear of the Mighty Ducks. Over the course of the rest of the season three teams, including Anaheim, would unseat the teams in playoff positioning in the West after the first month.\n\nThe combination of Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya was synonymous with the Mighty Ducks of the mid-late 1990s, so lacking one half of that dynamic duo at the start of the season was a major issue. Kariya missed the first 11 games of the campaign with a pulled abdominal muscle, contributing greatly the Anaheim offensive woes.\n\nSelanne lead the team in scoring through the first month with six goals and seven assists in the 12 games, with Kevin Todd in second with four goals and seven assists. Veteran Jarri Kurri, signed in the offseason from the Rangers, contributed as well with three goals and four assists, while on the backend Roman Oksiuta chipped in three goals and five assists and Fredrik Olausson had two goals and three assists.\n\nThe lack of scoring punch affected the defense as well. For the full season Anaheim averaged 28.4 shots per game while allowing 32.7, yet during the opening month the Mighty Ducks put 26.8 shots on goal per game while allowing 32.5. Anaheim averaged 2.3 goals per game during October, well below their eventual season average of 3.0, while surrendering 4.2 against per game. Goalie Guy Hebert struggled as well, posting a .874 save percentage amidst the lack of support.\n\nAnaheim didn't immediately vault up the standings with Kariya returning to the lineup in November, but the play stabilized and the team wouldn't lose more than three straight (which happened only twice) with Kariya and Selanne reunited. The offense kicked in to gear, with the Mighty Ducks averaging 3.3 goals per game in November and 3.7 goals per game in December.\n\nBy the time the All Star break rolled around Anaheim had pulled its season record up to 17-22-5, and Selanne, Kariya, and Hebert were all named to the Western Conference All Star team, giving the Mighty Ducks their first season with multiple All Star Game representatives. Selanne posted 25 goals and 31 assists in all 44 of the Mighty Ducks' games, while Kariya had 16 goals and 28 assists in 31 games. Hebert recovered as well, backstopping Anaheim to a 13-9-3 mark in his 26 starts following October with a .928 SV% and four shutouts during the span.\n\nIn the three months that followed the abysmal opening one, the Mighty Ducks didn't immediately vault upwards standings-wise, but they began winning more than they were losing. A 6-5-2 November was built upon with a 6-5-1 December. January saw Anaheim post a 7-5-1 mark before a 6-6-1 February. With two months left in the season the Mighty Ducks sat at 26-30-7, but were primed to make their big run.\n\nAfter a 3\u20131 loss at the Great Western Forum to Los Angeles on February 20, Anaheim began its best run of form for the season. The Mighty Ducks picked up points in 12 consecutive games, going 7-0-5 from February 22 to March 19, winning five and tying three against eventual playoff qualifiers during the stretch. Selanne and Kariya again lead the way, Selanne with 11 goals and eight assists while Kariya posted seven goals and 10 assists.\n\nYet Anaheim also saw significant contributions from Steve Rucchin with two goals and nine assists, Joe Sacco's two goals and six assists, and Ted Drury potting four goals and dishing two assists. The defense chipped in with Dmitri Mironov scoring three goals and adding eight assists, while Darren Van Impe had two goals and five assists. Hebert was lights-out as well, appearing in every game during the streak with a .946 SV%, and had nine games with more than 30 saves and two with more than 40.\n\nThe Mighty Ducks closed the season out with another unbeaten streak, going 5-0-2 over the final seven games. From February 22 on Anaheim went a league-best 13-3-7 to help the team sew up its first winning record, first playoff berth, and home ice against the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round. Selanne finished second in the league with 51 goals and second with 109 points, while Kariya earned Lady Byng honors with 99 points in 69 games while taking just three minor penalties.\n\n\n===Final

The team qualified for the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] for the first time in franchise history.\n{{TOClimit|limit=2}}\n\n==Offseason==\n\nForward [[Paul Kariya]] was named team captain, following the retirement of defenceman [[Randy Ladouceur]].\n\nThe Ducks only made one trade in the summer as the team looked good enough for the future following last season's late run, trading Mike Maneluk to the [[Ottawa Senators]] for [[Kevin Brown (ice hockey)|Kevin Brown]] on July 1st. Just before the season started Anaheim made an other deal with Ottawa trading [[Shaun Van Allen]] and [[Jason York]] in exchange for Ted Drury and [[Marc Moro]].\n\n==Regular season==\n\nThe previous season of 1995-96 the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had just narrowly missed the playoffs after being in the chase for the first time. The team put together a run of 12-4-3 over the final two months of the season to finish even with the Winnipeg Jets at 78 points in the standings, but the Jets earned the final spot thanks to having one more win.\n\nSo the Mighty Ducks start to the 96-97 season with a month of October that saw the team go 1-9-2 including an eight game losing streak was a huge disappointment to say the least. Anaheim was held to two or fewer goals eight times during the stretch, and the two times they exploded for six goals in a game they ended up having to settle for a tie.\n\nWith all of four points through the first month, Anaheim was bottom of the Pacific Division and the Western Conference. The division-leading Colorado Avalanche were 11 points clear, and the Los Angeles Kings held the eighth and final playoff spot six point clear of the Mighty Ducks. Over the course of the rest of the season three teams, including Anaheim, would unseat the teams in playoff positioning in the West after the first month.\n\nThe combination of Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya was synonymous with the Mighty Ducks of the mid-late 1990s, so lacking one half of that dynamic duo at the start of the season was a major issue. Kariya missed the first 11 games of the campaign with a pulled abdominal muscle, contributing greatly the Anaheim offensive woes.\n\nSelanne lead the team in scoring through the first month with six goals and seven assists in the 12 games, with Kevin Todd in second with four goals and seven assists. Veteran Jarri Kurri, signed in the offseason from the Rangers, contributed as well with three goals and four assists, while on the backend Roman Oksiuta chipped in three goals and five assists and Fredrik Olausson had two goals and three assists.\n\nThe lack of scoring punch affected the defense as well. For the full season Anaheim averaged 28.4 shots per game while allowing 32.7, yet during the opening month the Mighty Ducks put 26.8 shots on goal per game while allowing 32.5. Anaheim averaged 2.3 goals per game during October, well below their eventual season average of 3.0, while surrendering 4.2 against per game. Goalie Guy Hebert struggled as well, posting a .874 save percentage amidst the lack of support.\n\nAnaheim didn't immediately vault up the standings with Kariya returning to the lineup in November, but the play stabilized and the team wouldn't lose more than three straight (which happened only twice) with Kariya and Selanne reunited. The offense kicked in to gear, with the Mighty Ducks averaging 3.3 goals per game in November and 3.7 goals per game in December.\n\nBy the time the All Star break rolled around Anaheim had pulled its season record up to 17-22-5, and Selanne, Kariya, and Hebert were all named to the Western Conference All Star team, giving the Mighty Ducks their first season with multiple All Star Game representatives. Selanne posted 25 goals and 31 assists in all 44 of the Mighty Ducks' games, while Kariya had 16 goals and 28 assists in 31 games. Hebert recovered as well, backstopping Anaheim to a 13-9-3 mark in his 26 starts following October with a .928 SV% and four shutouts during the span.\n\nIn the three months that followed the abysmal opening one, the Mighty Ducks didn't immediately vault upwards standings-wise, but they began winning more than they were losing. A 6-5-2 November was built upon with a 6-5-1 December. January saw Anaheim post a 7-5-1 mark before a 6-6-1 February. With two months left in the season the Mighty Ducks sat at 26-30-7, but were primed to make their big run.\n\nAfter a 3-1 loss at the Great Western Forum to Los Angeles on February 20, Anaheim began its best run of form for the season. The Mighty Ducks picked up points in 12 consecutive games, going 7-0-5 from February 22 to March 19, winning five and tying three against eventual playoff qualifiers during the stretch. Selanne and Kariya again lead the way, Selanne with 11 goals and eight assists while Kariya posted seven goals and 10 assists.\n\nYet Anaheim also saw significant contributions from Steve Rucchin with two goals and nine assists, Joe Sacco's two goals and six assists, and Ted Drury potting four goals and dishing two assists. The defense chipped in with Dmitri Mironov scoring three goals and adding eight assits, while Darren Van Impe had two goals and five assists. Hebert was lights-out as well, appearing in every game during the streak with a .946 SV%, and had nine games with more than 30 saves and two with more than 40.\n\nThe Mighty Ducks closed the season out with another unbeaten streak, going 5-0-2 over the final seven games. From February 22 on Anaheim went a league-best 13-3-7 to help the team sew up its first winning record, first playoff berth, and home ice against the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round. Selanne finished second in the league with 51 goals and second with 109 points, while Kariya earned Lady Byng honors with 99 points in 69 games while taking just three minor penalties.\n\n\n===Final

Final body assembly is undertaken by Plaxton in [[Scarborough, England]].\n\nThe body and chassis design is also available in both 1 and 2 door [[Right- and left-hand traffic|left hand drive]] form in [[Continental Europe]].\n\nIt was originally intended to replace the [[Plaxton Beaver]] (built on [[Mercedes-Benz Vario]] chassis), but pressure from small operators such as [[Western Greyhound]] persuaded Plaxton to continue the Beaver.

The fluorescence intensity of the stained cells correlates with the amount of DNA they contain. As the DNA content doubles during the [[S phase]], the DNA content (and thereby intensity of fluorescence) of cells in the [[G0 phase|G<sub>0</sub> phase]] and [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub> phase]] (before S), in the S phase, and in the [[G2 phase|G<sub>2</sub> phase]] and [[M phase]] (after S) identifies the cell cycle phase position in the major phases (G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> versus S versus G<sub>2</sub>/M phase) of the cell cycle. The cellular DNA content of individual cells is often plotted as their frequency histogram to provide information about relative frequency (percentage) of cells in the major phases of the cell cycle.\n\nCell cycle anomalies revealed on the DNA content frequency histogram are often observed after different types of cell damage, for example such [[DNA damage]] that interrupts the cell cycle progression at certain [[cell cycle checkpoint|checkpoints]].

It is used to detect and quantify [[apoptosis]], a form of [[programmed cell death]], by analysing cells with a DNA content less than 2n (\"sub-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> cells\"). Such cells are usually the result of [[apoptotic DNA fragmentation]]: during apoptosis, the DNA is degraded by cellular [[endonuclease]]s. Therefore, [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] of apoptotic cells contain less DNA than nuclei of healthy G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> cells, resulting in a sub-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> peak in the fluorescence [[histogram]] that can be used to determine the relative amount of apoptotic cells in a sample.This method was developed and first described in 1991 by Nicoletti and co-workers at [[University of Perugia|Perugia University]] School of Medicine.<ref>{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Nicoletti I, Migliorati G, Pagliacci MC, Grignani F, Riccardi C | date        = 3 June 1991\n| title       = A rapid and simple method for measuring thymocyte apoptosis by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry\n| journal     = [[Journal of Immunological Methods]]\n| volume      = 139\n| issue       = 2\n| pages       = 271\u2013279\n| pmid        = 1710634\n| doi         = 10.1016/0022-1759(91)90198-O}}</ref> An optimised protocol developed by two of the authors of the original publication was published in 2006.<ref>{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Riccardi C, Nicoletti I | date        = 9 November 2006\n| title       = Analysis of apoptosis by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry\n| journal     = [[Nature Protocols]]\n| volume      = 1\n| issue       = 3\n| pages       = 1458\u20131461\n| pmid        = 17406435\n| doi         = 10.1038/nprot.2006.238}}</ref> The objects measured within the sub-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> peak, with DNA content  lesser than 5% of that of the G<sub>0</sub>G<sub>1</sub> peak, in all probability are apoptotic bodies and thus do not represent individual apoptotic cells <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Darzynkiewicz Z, Bedner E, Traganos F | year = 2001 | title = Difficulties and pitfalls in analysis of apoptosis | url = | journal = Methods Cell Biol | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 527\u2013559 | pmid = 11060857 }}</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Nicoletti assay with healthy (left) and apoptotic (middle and right) cells\n|width=259\n|height=170\n|lines=3\n|align=center\n|File:Nicoletti assay 1.png|alt1=|Healthy cells.

Aside from propidium iodide and acridine orange, quantifiable dyes that are frequently used include (but are not limited to) DRAQ5, [[7-Aminoactinomycin D]], [[DAPI]] and [[Hoechst 33342]].\n\n===Doublet discrimination===\n\nSince cells and especially fixed cells tend to stick together, cell aggregates have to be excluded from analysis through a process called ''doublet discrimination''. This is important because a doublet of two G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> cells has the same total content of DNA and thus the same fluorescence intensity as a single G<sub>2</sub>/M cell.<ref>Sharpless T, Traganos F, Darzynkiewicz Z, Melamed MR. (1975) Flow cytofluorimetry: discrimination between single cells and cell aggregates by direct size measurements.

It is used to detect and quantify [[apoptosis]], a form of [[programmed cell death]], by analysing cells with a DNA content less than 2n (\"sub-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> cells\"). Such cells are usually the result of [[apoptotic DNA fragmentation]]: during apoptosis, the DNA is degraded by cellular [[endonuclease]]s. Therefore, [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] of apoptotic cells contain less DNA than nuclei of healthy G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> cells, resulting in a sub-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> peak in the fluorescence [[histogram]] that can be used to determine the relative amount of apoptotic cells in a sample.This method was developed and first described in 1991 by Nicoletti and co-workers at [[University of Perugia|Perugia University]] School of Medicine.<ref>{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Nicoletti I, Migliorati G, Pagliacci MC, Grignani F, Riccardi C | date        = 3 June 1991\n| title       = A rapid and simple method for measuring thymocyte apoptosis by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry\n| journal     = [[Journal of Immunological Methods]]\n| volume      = 139\n| issue       = 2\n| pages       = 271\u2013279\n| pmid        = 1710634\n| doi         = 10.1016/0022-1759(91)90198-O}}</ref> An optimised protocol developed by two of the authors of the original publication was published in 2006.<ref>{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Riccardi C, Nicoletti I | date        = 9 November 2006\n| title       = Analysis of apoptosis by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry\n| journal     = [[Nature Protocols]]\n| volume      = 1\n| issue       = 3\n| pages       = 1458\u20131461\n| pmid        = 17406435\n| doi         = 10.1038/nprot.2006.238}}</ref> The objects measured within the sub-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> peak, with DNA content  lesser than 5% of that of the G<sub>0</sub>G<sub>1</sub> peak, in all probability are apoptotic bodies and thus do not represent individual apoptotic cells <ref>Darzynkiewicz Z, Bedner E, Traganos F.

The club fielded a women's team, Under 18s as well as teams in all junior divisions. Prospect Knights FC played all their home games at the Prospect Park Sports Complex, off Harley Parade in Prospect, a western suburb of Launceston, Tasmania, Australia. The club has also competed at the annual [[Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament|Australian & New Zealand Croatian Soccer Tournament]] on several occasions, including the 34th tournament in Geelong in 2008 and the 35th held in Adelaide in 2009.\n\nThe club's official playing strip was a combination of red, white and blue'' (Red tops, White shorts and Royal Blue socks)'' with the away/clash strip being a black version of home strip (''Black tops, White shorts and Royal Blue or White socks).''\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded in 1959 by [[Croatian Australians]] in [[Launceston, Tasmania]] as '''Launceston Croatia Soccer Club'''. The club played in the lower Northern Tasmanian leagues until 1964 when the club went into recess. The club was reformed in 1970. The club was promoted to the state's top league, the [[Northern Premier League (Tasmania)|Northern Premier League]], the following season. The club's first stint in the league (1971\u20131977) was one marked by poor performances, with the club finishing in the bottom three each season. The 1978 season saw the Tasmanian Premier League go from a two conference system to a one statewide league. As a consequence the club was relegated to Division 1.\n\nThe club returned to the Premier League in 1982 with a return to the two conference system, but was relegated after finishing last. The club's third stint in the Premier League (1985\u20131987) proved to be the club's most successful. The club finished in the top 5 each season.\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Launceston_croatia_1979.JPG|right|thumb|210px|Prospect Knights side from 1979.]] -->In 1986 the club also won the Bohemian Cup, defeating [[Hobart Olympia]] 3\u20132. In 1988 the Premier League again became a one league system, so once more the club found itself relegated.\n\nIn 1997 Soccer Australia (The governing body at the time, replaced by FFA in 2003) made the ruling that ethnic affiliations (club names) should be ended by Australian football clubs. As a result, '''Launceston Croatia''' became known as Western Knights following a merger at the start of the 97\u2019 season with fellow Premier League club '''Western Suburbs Soccer Club'''. Many players over the years had played for both Croatia and Suburbs, among them dual Rothmans Medal winner 1979\u201380 ''(playing for Glenorchy Croatia)'' Brian Davidson and George Dale winner (''playing for Western Suburbs)'' Peter Brookes.\n\n'''Western Suburbs''' ''(founded in 1980)'', themselves had some success during their 16-year history, including winning Devonports Night Series title and several Under 17s, 19s, Divisional, Reserves and Women's League and State titles. Like Croatia, Suburbs endured their own promotion and relegations from the Premier League to Division 1, dependent upon the combination of the club's on field performances, end of season league positions and what league structure Soccer Tasmania were putting in place from one season to the next.\n\nWestern Suburbs spent its first 10 years utilising the soccer and sports ground facilities at Prospect High School for home games and training. In 1990 the club began the clubrooms development at Prospect Park, Harley Parade the home of Prospect Knights FC. Following the merger of the two clubs, home games and training were split between Ogilvy Park and Harley Parade for the first season, whilst further developments were made at Harley Parade to include new clubroom and bar facilities in the late 1990s. The current clubrooms complex which was completed in 2008 incorporates 4 change rooms (2 home, 2 away), medical room, referees change room, 2 kiosks/kitchens and a large bar and function room which over looks and runs parallel with the main playing pitch.\n\nThe Prospect Knights FC logo reflects the club colours of the two former clubs, with the red, white and blue from Launceston Croatia and the gold and red from Western Suburbs gold, red and green. The club logo also incorporates the current club's establishment year, that of the merger in 1997 as well as the establishment dates of the two former clubs being 1959 for Croatia and 1980 for Suburbs respectively.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2000 the club had mixed results in all leagues. The Under 17's and Reserves sides had some strong performances to have them amongst the top sides in their respective leagues, while there was another league title for the club's Division 1 Men's team in 1998 and one of the club's two Women's teams ''(Western Knights Gold)'' secured yet another league title in 1999.\n\nIn 2000 the Tasmanian Premier League reverted to a two conference system. Once again this allowed the Knights to return to the top flight of Tasmanian soccer, where it has remained until this day. In this, the club's fourth stint in the Premier League, the club has seen mixed results, with 2006 being the club's best season, finishing 4th. In 2007 the club changed its name to the Prospect Knights FC.\n\n2008 saw the club's Premier League side equal its best season finish of 4th, with the Premier League Reserves side going the entire season undefeated to claim their first title since 1993 ''(Western Suburbs)'' and the Under 18s winning the U18 Northern Cup.\n\n2009 the Premier League side had its best ever season finishing 3rd and the Under 18s side winning both U18 League and Steve Hudson Cup titles.\n\n2011 saw the club's best finish to a season by its senior men's sides with the Premier League team securing the Clubs maiden Northern Premier League title in 52 years and the Premier League Reserves side finishing runners up. 2011 has seen the Premier League side have its best season in the club's history. Firstly coming Runners up to South Hobart in the Pre-season Steve Hudson cup, and then going through the season with just two defeats to secure the club's first ever Premier League title in 52 years, before bowing out of the Statewide Finals at the quarter final round to New Town. Along with this the Premier League Reserves came second to Devonport who were the only side to defeat them all season. The Under 18s had a mixed season, their final position of 7th was not possibly a true reflection of how they performed during the season. The women's team battled hard all season, memorably scoring against the much fancied Launceston City side and scoring a draw in their final match against Devonport to eventually finish in 10th.\n\nTo cap off a fantastic season for the club, the club's Premier League Captain Mark Baker became the first player from the Club since Peter Brookes ''(Western Suburbs)'' in the mid-1980s to win the Premier Leagues prestigious best & fairest award the George Dale Medal.\n\n2012 saw the Premier League side lose several players from the 2011 Championship team through work commitments, moving interstate/overseas or injury. For the first third of  the season they were still in the mix for a repeat of 2011. As the season progressed though, a series of results meant that a top 4 spot was the final ladder position. In the Statewide Finals series Quarter Final the Club was drawn against southern premiers South Hobart. Traveling down to Hobart they eventually went down 7\u20130 to end a long season. The Premier League Reserves had a season which introduced some of the Clubs under 18s to a higher level and this along with injuries and work commitments of other players meant that there was not the consistency of last years Runners-up side, eventually finishing 8th. The under 18s was a young side that was improving as the season progressed with several players during the season playing at higher levels in either seniors or reserves. The under 18s ended the season 9th. The Women's team were big improvers in 2012 winning 7 games and finishing the season mid table in 7th position.\n\nFaced with dwindling finances, the loss of players to the [[National Premier Leagues Tasmania]] and having to compete with the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] for facilities, the difficult decision to put the club into recess was taken in March 2015.<ref>[http://www.examiner.com.au/story/2933238/knights-armour-forced-off/ Knights\u2019 armour forced off] The Examiner, Rob Shaw, 9 March 2015</ref>\n\n==League Placings (Tasmanian Premier League only)==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the Statewide Finals series Quarter Final the Club was drawn against southern premiers South Hobart. Traveling down to Hobart they eventually went down 7\u20130 to end a long season. The Premier League Reserves had a season which introduced some of the Clubs under 18s to a higher level and this along with injuries and work commitments of other players meant that there was not the consistency of last years Runners-up side, eventually finishing 8th. The under 18s was a young side that was improving as the season progressed with several players during the season playing at higher levels in either seniors or reserves. The under 18s ended the season 9th. The Women's team were big improvers in 2012 winning 7 games and finishing the season mid table in 7th position.\n\nFaced with dwindling finances, the loss of players to the [[National Premier Leagues Tasmania]] and having to compete with the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] for facilities, the difficult decision to put the club into recess was taken in March 2015.<ref>[http://www.examiner.com.au/story/2933238/knights-armour-forced-off/ Knights\u2019 armour forced off] The Examiner, Rob Shaw, 9 March 2015</ref>\n\n==League Placings (Tasmanian Premier League only)==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
