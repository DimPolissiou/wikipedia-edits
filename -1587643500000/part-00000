Taunton Titans and Tonbridge Juddians will join the [[2020\u201321 National League 1]] (the highest level either club have reached), while [[Bournemouth Rugby Club|Bournemouth]] and [[Old Redcliffians]] drop down to [[South West Premier]] and [[Sutton & Epsom RFC|Sutton & Epsom]] to [[London & South East Premier]].  \n\nOther interesting news from the season was Taunton's [[Gary Kingdom]] who finished as top scorer in the division for the third time, tying him with [[Worthing Rugby Football Club|Worthing Raiders]] prolific [[Matthew McLean]].  An unwanted record was also made with Tonbridge Juddians official attendance of 0 from their game Sutton & Epsom on 21 December 2019 being the lowest ever recorded in a National League 2 South game.  This was due to the game being played behind closed doors due to safety concerns caused by flooding. \n\n{{horizontal TOC|nonum=yes}}\n\n==Structure==\nThe league consists of sixteen teams with all the teams playing each other on a home and away basis to make a total of thirty matches each. There is one automatic promotion place, one play-off place and three relegation places.  The champions are promoted to the [[2020\u201321 National League 1]] and the runners-up play the second-placed team in the [[2019\u201320 National League 2 North]] with the winner being promoted. The last three teams are relegated to either [[London & South East Premier]] or [[South West Premier]] depending on the geographical location of the team (in some cases teams may join the Midlands regional leagues).\n\nThe results of the matches contribute points to the league as follows:\n\n*4 points are awarded for a win\n*2 points are awarded for a draw\n*0 points are awarded for a loss, however\n*1 losing (bonus) point is awarded to a team that loses a match by 7 points or fewer\n*1 additional (bonus) point is awarded to a team scoring 4 tries or more in a match.\n\n==Participating teams and locations==\n\nEleven of the teams listed below participated in the [[2018\u201319 National League 2 South]] season.  The 2018\u201319 champions [[Rams RFC|Rams]] and play-off winners [[Canterbury RFC|Canterbury]], who won the promotion play-off against [[Chester RUFC|Chester]], were promoted into the [[2019\u201320 National League 1]], while [[Esher RFC|Esher]] were relegated into the division from the [[2018\u201319 National League 1]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Rams wrap up the title in fine style at Clifton|work=The RugbyPaper|issue=551|date=7 April 2019|pages=34\u201335}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentsportsnews.com/canterbury-19-10-chester-04-05-2019/|title=Canterbury 19-10 Chester|publisher=Kent Sports News|date=4 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Esher Relegated\">{{cite news|title=Esher denied their great escape despite triumph|work=The RugbyPaper|issue=554|date=28 April 2019|pages=26\u201327}}</ref>  Sides relegated from the 2018\u201319 National League 2 South included [[Birmingham & Solihull RFC|Birmingham & Solihull]] (to Greater Birmingham Merit Leagues), [[Guernsey RFC|Guernsey]] ([[London & South East Premier]]) and [[London Irish Wild Geese]] ([[South West Premier]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beesrugby.com/news/loss-at-rams-finally-consigns-bees-to-the-drop-2417630.html|title=Loss at Rams finally consigns Bees to the drop|publisher=Birmingham & Solihull RFC (Pitchero)|date=16 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingrugbyunion.co.uk/play-off-in-touching-distance-for-canterbury-and-bees-battle-for-survival/22678.htm|title=Play-off in touching distance for Canterbury and Bees battle for survival|publisher=Talking Rugby Union|date=12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingrugbyunion.co.uk/wild-geese-relegated-but-bees-and-guernsey-still-fighting/22603.htm|title=Wild Geese relegated but Bees and Guernsey still fighting|publisher=Talking Rugby Union|date=1 April 2018}}</ref>  In the case of Birmingham & Solihull, they had initially been supposed to drop to [[Midlands Premier]] but on further reflection decided to become an amateur club and drop out of the league system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beesrugby.com/news/club-update-withdrawal-from-midlands-premier-leagu-2432541.html  |title=Bees apply to join Greater Birmingham Merit League for 2019/20 season |publisher=Birmingham & Solihull RFC (Pitchero) |date=5 June 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe promoted teams are [[Bournemouth Rugby Club|Bournemouth]] who come up as champions of [[South West Premier]] while [[Sutton & Epsom RFC|Sutton & Epsom]] (champions) and [[Westcliff RFC|Westcliff]] (play-off) came up from [[London & South East Premier]].<ref>{{cite web|title=South West Premier 2018\u20132019|url=https://www.englandrugby.com/fixtures-and-results/competitions/south-west-division/2018-2019/group/26141#/results|website=England Rugby|accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.englandrugby.com/fixtures-and-results/competitions/london-se-division/2018-2019/group/26570 |title=2018\u20132019 London South-East Division|publisher=England Rugby|date=13 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.echo-news.co.uk/sport/17607183.westcliff-secure-promotion-after-big-win-in-play-off-final/|title=Westcliff Rugby Club secure promotion after big win in play-off final|publisher=Echo News|date=30 April 2019 }}</ref>  [[Leicester Lions RFC|Leicester Lions]] were level transferred into the division from [[National League 2 North]] in order to address an imbalance of teams in National 2, with Rams and Canterbury being promoted and only Esher dropping down from National League 1.

the south-east and south-west more straightforward than alternatives such as [[Luctonians]].\n\n{{col-begin|width=100%}}\n{{col-break|width=70%}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Team

overall) of the [[National League 2 South|fourth tier (south)]] of the English domestic [[rugby union]] competitions since the professionalised format of the [[RFU Championship|second division]] was introduced.  \n\nDue to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom]], the Rugby Football Union officially cancelled the season on 20 March 2020, after an initially postponment of all rugby in England including training.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.championshiprugby.co.uk/news/article/greene-king-ipa-championship-games-postponed|title=Greene King IPA Championship games

 After the cancellation was announced the RFU used a best playing record formula to decide the final table.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.talkingrugbyunion.co.uk/rfu-reveal-promotion-and-relegation-from-national-leagues/26030.htm|title=RFU reveal promotion and relegation from National Leagues|publisher=Talking Rugby Union|date=4 April 2020}}</ref>  This meant that [[Taunton R.F.C.|Taunton Titans]], who were 3 points clear when the league was suspended, were promoted as champions along with runners up [[Tonbridge Juddians Rugby Football Club|Tonbridge Juddians]], who went up as the best runner up as they had more considerably more points than [[2019\u201320 National League 2 North]] runner up [[Fylde Rugby Club|Fylde]].  \n\nThe relegated teams included [[Bournemouth Rugby Club|Bournemouth]], [[Old Redcliffians]] and [[Sutton & Epsom RFC|Sutton & Epsom]], all of whom had occupied the bottom three spots before league suspension, with 14th placed Sutton & Epsom 13 points behind 13th placed [[Westcliff RFC|Westcliff]] and safety.  Taunton Titans and Tonbridge Juddians will join the [[2020\u201321 National League 1]] (the highest level either club have reached), while [[Bournemouth Rugby Club|Bournemouth]] and [[Old Redcliffians]] drop down to [[South West Premier]] and [[Sutton & Epsom RFC|Sutton & Epsom]] to [[London & South East Premier]].  \n\nOther interesting news from the season was Taunton's [[Gary Kingdom]] who finished as top scorer in the division for the third time, tying him with [[Worthing Rugby Football Club|Worthing Raiders]] prolific [[Matthew McLean]].  An unwanted record was also made with Tonbridge Juddians official attendance of 0 from their game Sutton & Epsom on 21 December 2019 being the lowest ever recorded in a National League 2 South game.  This was due to the game being played behind closed doors due to safety concerns caused by flooding. \n\n{{horizontal TOC|nonum=yes}}\n\n==Structure==\nThe league consists of sixteen teams with all the teams playing each other on a home and away basis to make a total of thirty matches each. There is one automatic promotion place, one play-off place and three relegation places.  The champions are promoted to the [[2020\u201321 National League 1]] and the runners-up play the second-placed team in the [[2019\u201320 National League 2 North]] with the winner being promoted. The last three teams are relegated to either [[London & South East Premier]] or [[South West Premier]] depending on the geographical location of the team (in some cases teams may join the Midlands regional leagues).\n\nThe results of the matches contribute points to the league as follows:\n\n*4 points are awarded for a win\n*2 points are awarded for a draw\n*0 points are awarded for a loss, however\n*1 losing (bonus) point is awarded to a team that loses a match by 7 points or fewer\n*1 additional (bonus) point is awarded to a team scoring 4 tries or more in a match.\n\n==Participating teams and locations==\n\nEleven of the teams listed below participated in the [[2018\u201319 National League 2 South]] season.  The 2018\u201319 champions [[Rams RFC|Rams]] and play-off winners [[Canterbury RFC|Canterbury]], who won the promotion play-off against [[Chester RUFC|Chester]], were promoted into the [[2019\u201320 National League 1]], while [[Esher RFC|Esher]] were relegated into the division from the [[2018\u201319 National League 1]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Rams wrap up the title in fine style at Clifton|work=The RugbyPaper|issue=551|date=7 April 2019|pages=34\u201335}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentsportsnews.com/canterbury-19-10-chester-04-05-2019/|title=Canterbury 19-10 Chester|publisher=Kent Sports News|date=4 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Esher Relegated\">{{cite news|title=Esher denied their great escape despite triumph|work=The RugbyPaper|issue=554|date=28 April 2019|pages=26\u201327}}</ref>  Sides relegated from the 2018\u201319 National League 2 South included [[Birmingham & Solihull RFC|Birmingham & Solihull]] (to Greater Birmingham Merit Leagues), [[Guernsey RFC|Guernsey]] ([[London & South East Premier]]) and [[London Irish Wild Geese]] ([[South West Premier]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beesrugby.com/news/loss-at-rams-finally-consigns-bees-to-the-drop-2417630.html|title=Loss at Rams finally consigns Bees to the drop|publisher=Birmingham & Solihull RFC (Pitchero)|date=16 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingrugbyunion.co.uk/play-off-in-touching-distance-for-canterbury-and-bees-battle-for-survival/22678.htm|title=Play-off in touching distance for Canterbury and Bees battle for survival|publisher=Talking Rugby Union|date=12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingrugbyunion.co.uk/wild-geese-relegated-but-bees-and-guernsey-still-fighting/22603.htm|title=Wild Geese relegated but Bees and Guernsey still fighting|publisher=Talking Rugby Union|date=1 April 2018}}</ref>  In the case of Birmingham & Solihull, they had initially been supposed to drop to [[Midlands Premier]] but on further reflection decided to become an amateur club and drop out of the league system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beesrugby.com/news/club-update-withdrawal-from-midlands-premier-leagu-2432541.html  |title=Bees apply to join Greater Birmingham Merit League for 2019/20 season |publisher=Birmingham & Solihull RFC (Pitchero) |date=5 June 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe promoted teams are [[Bournemouth Rugby Club|Bournemouth]] who come up as champions of [[South West Premier]] while [[Sutton & Epsom RFC|Sutton & Epsom]] (champions) and [[Westcliff RFC|Westcliff]] (play-off) came up from [[London & South East Premier]].<ref>{{cite web|title=South West Premier 2018\u20132019|url=https://www.englandrugby.com/fixtures-and-results/competitions/south-west-division/2018-2019/group/26141#/results|website=England Rugby|accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.englandrugby.com/fixtures-and-results/competitions/london-se-division/2018-2019/group/26570 |title=2018\u20132019 London South-East Division|publisher=England Rugby|date=13 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.echo-news.co.uk/sport/17607183.westcliff-secure-promotion-after-big-win-in-play-off-final/|title=Westcliff Rugby Club secure promotion after big win in play-off final|publisher=Echo News|date=30 April 2019 }}</ref>  [[Leicester Lions RFC|Leicester Lions]] were level transferred into the division from [[National League 2 North]] in order to address an imbalance of teams in National 2, with Rams and Canterbury being promoted and only Esher dropping down from National League 1.

The film stars [[Hanna Schygulla]] as Maria, whose marriage to the soldier Hermann remains unfulfilled due to World War II and his post-war imprisonment. Maria adapts to the realities of post-war Germany and becomes the wealthy mistress of an industrialist, all the while staying true to her love for Hermann. The film was one of Fassbinder's more successful works and shaped the image of the [[New German Cinema]] in foreign countries. The film is the first installment of Fassbinder's [[BRD Trilogy]], followed by ''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' and ''[[Veronika Voss]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts in Germany in 1943. During an Allied bombing raid Maria marries the soldier Hermann Braun. After \"half a day and a whole night\" together, Hermann returns to the Eastern front the following day. Following the end of the war, Maria is informed that Hermann has been killed. Maria starts work as a hostess in a bar frequented by American soldiers. She has a relationship with African-American soldier Bill, who supports her and gives her nylon stockings and cigarettes. She becomes pregnant by Bill.\n\nHowever, Hermann was not killed, and returns home to discover Maria and Bill undressing each other. A fight between Hermann and Bill ensues. When Hermann seems in danger, Maria unintentionally kills Bill, striking his head with a full bottle. Maria is tried by a military tribunal and expresses her love for both Bill and Hermann; Hermann is so struck with Maria's devotion that he takes the blame for the killing and is imprisoned. Maria (apparently) aborts her pregnancy and asks her doctor to promise to maintain the grave. On the train home, Maria catches the eye of a wealthy industrialist, Karl Oswald. Oswald, an older man, offers her a position as his assistant, and shortly thereafter Maria becomes his mistress to \"maintain the upper hand\". Maria visits Hermann again and tells him about the development, promising that their life will start as soon as he is released. Maria becomes wealthy and buys a house.\n\nOswald visits Hermann and offers to make him and Maria heirs to his wealth if Hermann deserts Maria after his release. Neither man tells Maria of their agreement. On release, Hermann emigrates to Canada and sends Maria a red rose each month to remind her he still loves her.\n\nFollowing Oswald's death, Hermann returns to Germany and to Maria. When Oswald's will is read by Senkenberg, the executor, Maria hears about Oswald's agreement with Hermann. Distressed, Maria and Hermann briefly argue about how they supposedly sacrificed through their whole life\u2019s for each other, then she goes into the kitchen to light a cigarette from the burner of the stovetop. Maria is offscreen as Hermann is seen watching her, when he lurches away and screams \u201cNein\u201d. Before this, Maria had left the gas stove opened after lighting up a cigarette in the same place. A moment later, the apartment suffers a gas explosion from the stove, killing Maria and Hermann.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Hanna Schygulla]] as Maria Braun\n*[[Klaus L\u00f6witsch]] as Hermann Braun\n*[[Ivan Desny]] as Karl Oswald\n*[[Gisela Uhlen]] as Mother\n*[[Elisabeth Trissenaar]] as Betti Klenze\n*[[Gottfried John]] as Willi Klenze\n*[[Hark Bohm]] as Senkenberg\n*[[George Byrd]] as Bill\n*[[Claus Holm]] as Doctor\n*[[G\u00fcnter Lamprecht]] as Hans Wetzel \n*[[Anton Schiersner]] as Grandpa Berger\n*[[Sonja Neudorfer]] as Red Cross nurse\n*[[Volker Spengler]] as Train conductor\n*[[Isolde Barth]] as Vevi\n*[[Lilo Pempeit]] as Mrs. Ehmke\n*[[Bruce Low]] as American at the conference\n*[[G\u00fcnther Kaufmann]] as American on the train\n*[[Karl-Heinz von Hassel]] as Prosecuting attorney \n*[[Hannes Kaetner]] as Justice of the Peace\n*[[Kristine de Loup]] as Notary\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing and pre-production===\nThe idea for ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' can be traced to the collaboration of Rainer Werner Fassbinder and [[Alexander Kluge]] on the unrealized television project ''The Marriage of our Parents'' (''Die Ehen unserer Eltern''), which was developed after the critical success of the [[Anthology film|omnibus film]] ''[[Germany in Autumn]]''. Fassbinder worked on a draft screenplay together with Klaus-Dieter Lang and [[Kurt Raab]] and presented it in the early summer of 1977 to his longtime collaborator [[Peter M\u00e4rthesheimer]], who at that time was working as a dramaturge at the [[Bavaria Film Studios]]. In August 1977 M\u00e4rthesheimer and his partner [[Pea Fr\u00f6hlich]], a professor of psychology and pedagogics, were commissioned to write a screenplay based on the draft together.<ref name=\"wunderbarezeit\">{{cite book|last=M\u00e4rthesheimer|first=Peter|author2=Pea Fr\u00f6hlich|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun: Ein Drehbuch fur Rainer Werner Fassbinder|editor=Michael T\u00f6teberg|publisher=Belleville Verlag|year=1997|chapter=Eine wunderbare Zeit|page=5|isbn=3-923646-58-5|language=German}}</ref> Although it was M\u00e4rthesheimer's and Fr\u00f6hlich's first screenplay their knowledge of Fassbinder's works allowed them to match the screenplay to the characteristic style and structure of Fassbinder's other works.<ref>{{cite book|last=T\u00f6teberg|first=Michael|title=Rainer Werner Fassbinder|publisher=Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag|date=June 2002|pages=116&ndash;117|language=German}}</ref> Fassbinder changed only a few details in the completed screenplay, including some dialogue and the end of the film.

On his suggestion Fassbinder and Fengler visited [[Romy Schneider]] and asked her to play the role of Maria Braun.

Albatros Filmproduktion only contributed 42,500 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]], the public broadcaster [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] 566,000 DM, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Filmf\u00f6rderungsanstalt|de|3=Filmf\u00f6rderungsanstalt|lt=German Federal Film Board}} 400,000 DM and the distributor guaranteed another 150,000 DM. This forced Fengler to find another financing partner, offering [[Hanns Eckelkamp]]'s Trio-Film a share in the film in December 1977.<ref name=\"marthesheimer-page-155\">{{cite book|last=M\u00e4rthesheimer|first=Peter|author2=Pea Fr\u00f6hlich|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun: Ein Drehbuch fur Rainer Werner Fassbinder|editor=Michael T\u00f6teberg|publisher=Belleville Verlag|year=1997|page=155|chapter=Schwarzmarkt der Gef\u00fchle|isbn= 3-923646-58-5|language=German}}</ref> Fengler had promised Fassbinder's Tango-Film a share of 50 percent of the film profits, but as Fengler - by offering Trio-Film a share in the film - effectively oversold the rights only 15 percent of the film right ultimately remained with Fassbinder. Fassbinder subsequently referred to Fengler as gangster and it led to litigations against Fengler that continued even after Fassbinder's death.<ref name=\"elsaesser-page-98\">{{cite book|last=Elsaesser|first=Thomas|title=Fassbinder's Germany: History, Identity, Subject|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|date=June 1996|page=98|isbn=90-5356-059-9}}</ref>\n\nShooting began in January 1978 in [[Coburg]]. Bad-tempered and quarrelsome, Fassbinder shot the film during the day and worked on the script to ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' during the night.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berling|first=Peter|title=Die 13 Jahre des Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Seine Filme, seine Freunde, seine Feinde|publisher=Bastei L\u00fcbbe|year=1972|pages=336|isbn=3-7857-0643-X|language=German}}</ref> In order to sustain his work schedule he consumed large quantities of cocaine, supplied by the production manager [[Harry Baer]] and the actor [[Peter Berling]]. According to Berling this was the main reason why the film went over the budget, as the cash for the cocaine was coming from Fengler.<ref name=\"elsaesser-page-98\"/>\n\nIn February 1978 the budget was reaching 1.7 million DM, and two most expensive scenes - the explosions at the beginning and at the end of the film - had not yet been shot. By this time Fassbinder had learned about Fengler's deal with Eckelkamp and the overselling of the film rights. He felt deceived and broke with his longtime collaborator Fengler. He demanded the status of a co-producer for himself and obtained an injunction against Fengler and Eckelkamp. Fassbinder fired most of the film crew, ended the shooting in Coburg at the end of February and then moved to [[Berlin]], where he finished shooting the last scenes.<ref name=\"marthesheimer-page-155\" /> Consequently, the biographer Thomas Elsaesser called the production of the film \"one of Fassbinder's least happy experiences\" and Berlin \"one of the decisive self-destructive episodes in Rainer's life\".<ref name=\"elsaesser-page-97\" />\n\n==Distribution and reception==\n\n===Release===\nIn parallel to the preparations for the production of ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' Fassbinder worked with film editor [[Juliane Lorenz]] on the editing and post-production of ''The Marriage of Maria Braun''. The failure of ''[[Despair (film)|Despair]]'' at the [[1978 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May 1978 spurred Fassbinder to prepare an [[answer print]] overnight and to present the film on 22 May 1978 to German film producers in a private screening. Attended by, among others [[Horst Wendlandt]], [[Sam Waynberg]], [[Karl Spiehs]], [[G\u00fcnter Rohrbach]] and the majority shareholder of the [[Filmverlag der Autoren]], [[Rudolf Augstein]] the screening was a success.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berling|first=Peter|title=Die 13 Jahre des Rainer Werner Fassbinder.

Commissioned by Eckelkamp, the author [[Gerhard Zwerenz]] novelized the film. It was published in several weekly installments in the magazine ''[[Stern (magazine)|Der Stern]]'' from March over a period of three months, thus increasing public interest in the film.<ref>{{cite book|last=M\u00e4rthesheimer|first=Peter|author2=Pea Fr\u00f6hlich|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun: Ein Drehbuch fur Rainer Werner Fassbinder|editor=Michael T\u00f6teberg|publisher=Belleville Verlag|year=1997|pages=163&ndash;165|chapter=Schwarzmarkt der Gef\u00fchle|isbn=3-923646-58-5|language=German}}</ref> The official premiere of the film was on 20 February 1979 during the [[29th Berlin International Film Festival]].

Almost one year later the film was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[37th Golden Globe Awards]], but this success was overshadowed by the success of [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]]'s ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'' at the [[52nd Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Haase|first=Christine|title=When Heimat meets Hollywood: German filmmakers and America, 1985&ndash;2005|publisher=Camden House|date=November 2007|series=Studies in German Literature Linguistics and Culture|page=75|isbn=1-57113-279-1}}</ref> The commercial success of ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' strengthened the negotiation position of Fassbinder in his subsequent film projects. He received a financing agreement for one of his favorite projects based on [[Pitigrilli]]'s novel ''Cocaine'' and was able to increase the budget for ''Berlin Alexanderplatz''. Several German commercial film producers expressed an interest in making films with Fassbinder. The seasoned film producer [[Luggi Waldleitner]] would produce the Fassbinder film ''[[Lili Marleen (film)|Lili Marleen]]'' with Hanna Schygulla in the main role. [[Horst Wendlandt]] would produce the two other films in the BRD Trilogy, ''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' and ''[[Veronika Voss]]''. His success also allowed him to realize his last project, ''[[Querelle]]'' which was co-financed by [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Elsaesser|first=Thomas|title=Fassbinder's Germany: History, Identity, Subject|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|date=June 1996|page=99&ndash;100|isbn=90-5356-059-9}}</ref>\n\nAs Fengler had oversold the rights to the film, the profit share of Fassbinder was an open question. Eckelkamp saw himself as the sole owner of all rights, but sent a check in the amount of 70,000 DM to Fassbinder in 1982 to appease the director. After Fassbinder's death his mother and heiress Liselotte Eder revived the claims, but was rejected by Eckelkamp. In the course of legal proceedings Eckelkamp was ordered in 1986 to disclose the film's finances to the newly founded Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation. Eckelkamp's Trio Film disclosed a budget of almost 2 million DM, additional marketing costs of 1 million DM and a net profit of 1 million DM. When Trio-Film was ordered to pay to Fassbinder's heirs 290,000 DM Eckelkamp refused. At the request of the Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation Trio Film had to declare bankruptcy in 1988. In the course of the continuing legal proceedings, the [[Oberlandesgericht]] [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] certified in 1990 that Fassbinder was not a co-producer of the film. The ruling was upheld by the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]], but also ruled that the Fassbinder heirs were entitled to a share of the film's profits.<ref>{{cite book|last=M\u00e4rthesheimer|first=Peter|author2=Pea Fr\u00f6hlich|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun: Ein Drehbuch fur Rainer Werner Fassbinder|editor=Michael T\u00f6teberg|publisher=Belleville Verlag|year=1997|page=174|chapter=Schwarzmarkt der Gef\u00fchle|isbn=3-923646-58-5|language=German}}</ref> Today all film rights are owned by the Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fassbinderfoundation.de/node.php/de/berlin|title=Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation|date=October 2008|publisher=Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation|language=German|accessdate=28 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117150603/http://www.fassbinderfoundation.de/node.php/de/berlin|archivedate=17 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book|last=M\u00e4rthesheimer|first=Peter|author2=Pea Fr\u00f6hlich|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun: Ein Drehbuch fur Rainer Werner Fassbinder|editor=Michael T\u00f6teberg|publisher=Belleville Verlag|year=1997|isbn=3-923646-58-5|language=German}} (Screenplay)\n* {{cite book|last=Zwerenz|first=Gerhard|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun|publisher=Goldmann Verlag|date=January 1979|isbn=3-442-03841-3|language=German}} (Novel based on the film)\n* {{cite book|title=The Marriage of Maria Braun: Rainer Werner Fassbinder, director|editor=Joyce Rheuban|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=January 1986|series=Rutgers Films in Print|isbn=0-8135-1130-5}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n*Anton Kaes.

The film stars [[Hanna Schygulla]] as Maria, whose marriage to the soldier Hermann remains unfulfilled due to World War II and his post-war imprisonment. Maria adapts to the realities of post-war Germany and becomes the wealthy mistress of an industrialist, all the while staying true to her love for Hermann. The film was one of the more successful works of Fassbinder and shaped the image of the [[New German Cinema]] in foreign countries. The film is the first installment of Fassbinder's [[BRD Trilogy]], followed by ''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' and ''[[Veronika Voss]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts in Germany in 1943. During an Allied bombing raid Maria marries the soldier Hermann Braun. After \"half a day and a whole night\" together, Hermann returns to the Eastern front the following day. Following the end of the war, Maria is informed that Hermann has been killed. Maria starts work as a hostess in a bar frequented by American soldiers. She has a relationship with African-American soldier Bill, who supports her and gives her nylon stockings and cigarettes. She becomes pregnant by Bill.\n\nHowever, Hermann was not killed, and returns home to discover Maria and Bill undressing each other. A fight between Hermann and Bill ensues. When Hermann seems in danger, Maria unintentionally kills Bill, striking his head with a full bottle. Maria is tried by a military tribunal and expresses her love for both Bill and Hermann; Hermann is so struck with Maria's devotion that he takes the blame for the killing and is imprisoned. Maria (apparently) aborts her pregnancy and asks her doctor to promise to maintain the grave. On the train home, Maria catches the eye of a wealthy industrialist, Karl Oswald. Oswald, an older man, offers her a position as his assistant, and shortly thereafter Maria becomes his mistress to \"maintain the upper hand\". Maria visits Hermann again and tells him about the development, promising that their life will start as soon as he is released. Maria becomes wealthy and buys a house.\n\nOswald visits Hermann and offers to make him and Maria heirs to his wealth if Hermann deserts Maria after his release. Neither man tells Maria of their agreement. On release, Hermann emigrates to Canada and sends Maria a red rose each month to remind her he still loves her.\n\nFollowing Oswald's death, Hermann returns to Germany and to Maria. When Oswald's will is read by Senkenberg, the executor, Maria hears about Oswald's agreement with Hermann. Distressed, Maria and Hermann briefly argue about how they supposedly sacrificed through their whole life\u2019s for each other, then she goes into the kitchen to light a cigarette from the burner of the stovetop. Maria is offscreen as Hermann is seen watching her, when he lurches away and screams \u201cNein\u201d. Before this, Maria had left the gas stove opened after lighting up a cigarette in the same place. A moment later, the apartment suffers a gas explosion from the stove, killing Maria and Hermann.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Hanna Schygulla]] as Maria Braun\n*[[Klaus L\u00f6witsch]] as Hermann Braun\n*[[Ivan Desny]] as Karl Oswald\n*[[Gisela Uhlen]] as Mother\n*[[Elisabeth Trissenaar]] as Betti Klenze\n*[[Gottfried John]] as Willi Klenze\n*[[Hark Bohm]] as Senkenberg\n*[[George Byrd]] as Bill\n*[[Claus Holm]] as Doctor\n*[[G\u00fcnter Lamprecht]] as Hans Wetzel \n*[[Anton Schiersner]] as Grandpa Berger\n*[[Sonja Neudorfer]] as Red Cross nurse\n*[[Volker Spengler]] as Train conductor\n*[[Isolde Barth]] as Vevi\n*[[Lilo Pempeit]] as Mrs. Ehmke\n*[[Bruce Low]] as American at the conference\n*[[G\u00fcnther Kaufmann]] as American on the train\n*[[Karl-Heinz von Hassel]] as Prosecuting attorney \n*[[Hannes Kaetner]] as Justice of the Peace\n*[[Kristine de Loup]] as Notary\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing and pre-production===\nThe idea for ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' can be traced to the collaboration of Rainer Werner Fassbinder and [[Alexander Kluge]] on the unrealized television project ''The Marriage of our Parents'' (''Die Ehen unserer Eltern''), which was developed after the critical success of the [[Anthology film|omnibus film]] ''[[Germany in Autumn]]''. Fassbinder worked on a draft screenplay together with Klaus-Dieter Lang and [[Kurt Raab]] and presented it in the early summer of 1977 to his longtime collaborator [[Peter M\u00e4rthesheimer]], who at that time was working as a dramaturge at the [[Bavaria Film Studios]]. In August 1977 M\u00e4rthesheimer and his partner [[Pea Fr\u00f6hlich]], a professor of psychology and pedagogics, were commissioned to write a screenplay based on the draft together.<ref name=\"wunderbarezeit\">{{cite book|last=M\u00e4rthesheimer|first=Peter|author2=Pea Fr\u00f6hlich|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun: Ein Drehbuch fur Rainer Werner Fassbinder|editor=Michael T\u00f6teberg|publisher=Belleville Verlag|year=1997|chapter=Eine wunderbare Zeit|page=5|isbn=3-923646-58-5|language=German}}</ref> Although it was M\u00e4rthesheimer's and Fr\u00f6hlich's first screenplay their knowledge of Fassbinder's works allowed them to match the screenplay to the characteristic style and structure of Fassbinder's other works.<ref>{{cite book|last=T\u00f6teberg|first=Michael|title=Rainer Werner Fassbinder|publisher=Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag|date=June 2002|pages=116&ndash;117|language=German}}</ref> Fassbinder changed only a few details in the completed screenplay, including some dialogue and the end of the film.

On his suggestion Fassbinder and Fengler visited [[Romy Schneider]] and asked her to play the role of Maria Braun. Due to Romy Schneider's alcohol problems, fickleness, and demands, the role was then given to [[Hanna Schygulla]], her first collaboration with Fassbinder in four years.<ref name=\"elsaesser-page-97\">{{cite book|last=Elsaesser|first=Thomas|title=Fassbinder's Germany: History, Identity, Subject|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|date=June 1996|page=97|isbn=90-5356-059-9}}</ref> [[Yves Montand]] also showed interest in the film, but wanted to play Maria's husband Hermann and not - as suggested by Fassbinder and Fengler - the industrialist Oswald.

Albatros Filmproduktion only contributed 42,500 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]], the public broadcaster [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] 566,000 DM, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Filmf\u00f6rderungsanstalt|de|3=Filmf\u00f6rderungsanstalt|lt=German Federal Film Board}} 400,000 DM and the distributor guaranteed another 150,000 DM. This forced Fengler to find another financing partner, offering [[Hanns Eckelkamp]]'s Trio-Film a share in the film in December 1977.<ref name=\"marthesheimer-page-155\">{{cite book|last=M\u00e4rthesheimer|first=Peter|author2=Pea Fr\u00f6hlich|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun: Ein Drehbuch fur Rainer Werner Fassbinder|editor=Michael T\u00f6teberg|publisher=Belleville Verlag|year=1997|page=155|chapter=Schwarzmarkt der Gef\u00fchle|isbn= 3-923646-58-5|language=German}}</ref> Fengler had promised Fassbinder's Tango-Film a share of 50 percent of the film profits, but as Fengler - by offering Trio-Film a share in the film - effectively oversold the rights only 15 percent of the film right ultimately remained with Fassbinder. Fassbinder subsequently referred to Fengler as gangster and it led to litigations against Fengler that continued even after Fassbinder's death.<ref name=\"elsaesser-page-98\">{{cite book|last=Elsaesser|first=Thomas|title=Fassbinder's Germany: History, Identity, Subject|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|date=June 1996|page=98|isbn=90-5356-059-9}}</ref>\n\nShooting began in January 1978 in [[Coburg]]. Bad-tempered and quarrelsome, Fassbinder shot the film during the day and worked on the script to ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' during the night.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berling|first=Peter|title=Die 13 Jahre des Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Seine Filme, seine Freunde, seine Feinde|publisher=Bastei L\u00fcbbe|year=1972|pages=336|isbn=3-7857-0643-X|language=German}}</ref> In order to sustain his work schedule he consumed large quantities of cocaine, supplied by the production manager [[Harry Baer]] and the actor [[Peter Berling]]. According to Berling this was the main reason why the film went over the budget, as the cash for the cocaine was coming from Fengler.<ref name=\"elsaesser-page-98\"/>\n\nIn February 1978 the budget was reaching 1.7 million DM, and two most expensive scenes - the explosions at the beginning and at the end of the film - had not yet been shot. By this time Fassbinder had learned about Fengler's deal with Eckelkamp and the overselling of the film rights. He felt deceived and broke with his longtime collaborator Fengler. He demanded the status of a co-producer for himself and obtained an injunction against Fengler and Eckelkamp. Fassbinder fired most of the film crew, ended the shooting in Coburg at the end of February and then moved to [[Berlin]], where he finished shooting the last scenes.<ref name=\"marthesheimer-page-155\" /> Consequently, the biographer Thomas Elsaesser called the production of the film \"one of Fassbinder's least happy experiences\" and Berlin \"one of the decisive self-destructive episodes in Rainer's life\".<ref name=\"elsaesser-page-97\" />\n\n==Distribution and reception==\n\n===Release===\nIn parallel to the preparations for the production of ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' Fassbinder worked with film editor [[Juliane Lorenz]] on the editing and post-production of ''The Marriage of Maria Braun''. The failure of ''[[Despair (film)|Despair]]'' at the [[1978 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May 1978 spurred Fassbinder to prepare an [[answer print]] overnight and to present the film on 22 May 1978 to German film producers in a private screening. Attended by, among others [[Horst Wendlandt]], [[Sam Waynberg]], [[Karl Spiehs]], [[G\u00fcnter Rohrbach]] and the majority shareholder of the [[Filmverlag der Autoren]], [[Rudolf Augstein]] the screening was a success.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berling|first=Peter|title=Die 13 Jahre des Rainer Werner Fassbinder.

In the weekly newspaper ''[[Die Zeit]]'' Hans-Christoph Blumenberg called the film \"the most accessible (and thus most commercial) and mature work of the director\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/1979/10/Der-Mann-der-die-Toten-liebte|title=Der Mann, der die Toten liebte|last=Blumenberg|first=Hans C.|date=1979-03-02|publisher=Die Zeit|language=German|accessdate=28 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607071751/http://www.zeit.de/1979/10/Der-Mann-der-die-Toten-liebte|archivedate=7 June 2011}}, \"dem zug\u00e4nglichsten (und damit auch kommerziellsten) und reifsten Werk des Regisseur\"</ref> Karena Niehoff wrote in the daily newspaper ''[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]'' that ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' \"is a charming and even amusing film, at the same time extraordinarily artful, artificial and full of twists and turns\".<ref name=\"fischer-page-163\">{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Robert|author2=Joe Hembus|title=Der neue deutsche Film 1960&ndash;1980|publisher=Wilhelm Goldmann Verlag|date=March 1985|page=163|isbn=3-442-10211-1|language=German}}, \"ein richtig charmanter und sogar witziger Kinofilm und zugleich ungemein kunstvoll, k\u00fcnstlich und mit Fallt\u00fcren noch und noch\"</ref>\n\nHanna Schygulla was praised by many film critics.

From its release until October 1979 more than 400,000 tickets were sold in West Germany, and was shown for up to 20 weeks in some film theaters.<ref name=\"marthesheimer-page-168\">{{cite book|last=M\u00e4rthesheimer|first=Peter|author2=Pea Fr\u00f6hlich|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun: Ein Drehbuch fur Rainer Werner Fassbinder|editor=Michael T\u00f6teberg|publisher=Belleville Verlag|year=1997|page=168|chapter=Schwarzmarkt der Gef\u00fchle|isbn=3-923646-58-5|language=German}}</ref> In West Germany alone the film made more than 4 million DM at the box office.<ref name=\"elsaesser-page-97\" /> In the same year of its German release the distribution deals for 25 countries were negotiated. In August 1981 the film was the first film by Fassbinder to be shown in East German film theaters.<ref name=\"marthesheimer-page-168\" /> In the first six weeks of its theatrical release in the United States the film made $1.8 million at the box office.<ref name=\"marthesheimer-page-169\" />\n\nThe film was not the [[List of German submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|official German submission]] to the [[51st Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]. Instead [[Hans W. Gei\u00dfend\u00f6rfer]]'s ''[[The Glass Cell (film)|The Glass Cell]]'' was chosen to be the official German submission. Almost one year later the film was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[37th Golden Globe Awards]], but this success was overshadowed by the success of [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]]'s ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'' at the [[52nd Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Haase|first=Christine|title=When Heimat meets Hollywood: German filmmakers and America, 1985&ndash;2005|publisher=Camden House|date=November 2007|series=Studies in German Literature Linguistics and Culture|page=75|isbn=1-57113-279-1}}</ref> The commercial success of ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' strengthened the negotiation position of Fassbinder in his subsequent film projects. He received a financing agreement for one of his favorite projects based on [[Pitigrilli]]'s novel ''Cocaine'' and was able to increase the budget for ''Berlin Alexanderplatz''. Several German commercial film producers expressed an interest in making films with Fassbinder. The seasoned film producer [[Luggi Waldleitner]] would produce the Fassbinder film ''[[Lili Marleen (film)|Lili Marleen]]'' with Hanna Schygulla in the main role. [[Horst Wendlandt]] would produce the two other films in the BRD Trilogy, ''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' and ''[[Veronika Voss]]''. His success also allowed him to realize his last project, ''[[Querelle]]'' which was co-financed by [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Elsaesser|first=Thomas|title=Fassbinder's Germany: History, Identity, Subject|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|date=June 1996|page=99&ndash;100|isbn=90-5356-059-9}}</ref>\n\nAs Fengler had oversold the rights to the film, the profit share of Fassbinder was an open question. Eckelkamp saw himself as the sole owner of all rights, but sent a check in the amount of 70,000 DM to Fassbinder in 1982 to appease the director. After Fassbinder's death his mother and heiress Liselotte Eder revived the claims, but was rejected by Eckelkamp. In the course of legal proceedings Eckelkamp was ordered in 1986 to disclose the film's finances to the newly founded Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation. Eckelkamp's Trio Film disclosed a budget of almost 2 million DM, additional marketing costs of 1 million DM and a net profit of 1 million DM. When Trio-Film was ordered to pay to Fassbinder's heirs 290,000 DM Eckelkamp refused. At the request of the Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation Trio Film had to declare bankruptcy in 1988. In the course of the continuing legal proceedings, the [[Oberlandesgericht]] [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] certified in 1990 that Fassbinder was not a co-producer of the film. The ruling was upheld by the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]], but also ruled that the Fassbinder heirs were entitled to a share of the film's profits.<ref>{{cite book|last=M\u00e4rthesheimer|first=Peter|author2=Pea Fr\u00f6hlich|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun: Ein Drehbuch fur Rainer Werner Fassbinder|editor=Michael T\u00f6teberg|publisher=Belleville Verlag|year=1997|page=174|chapter=Schwarzmarkt der Gef\u00fchle|isbn=3-923646-58-5|language=German}}</ref> Today all film rights are owned by the Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fassbinderfoundation.de/node.php/de/berlin|title=Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation|date=October 2008|publisher=Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation|language=German|accessdate=28 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117150603/http://www.fassbinderfoundation.de/node.php/de/berlin|archivedate=17 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book|last=M\u00e4rthesheimer|first=Peter|author2=Pea Fr\u00f6hlich|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun: Ein Drehbuch fur Rainer Werner Fassbinder|editor=Michael T\u00f6teberg|publisher=Belleville Verlag|year=1997|isbn=3-923646-58-5|language=German}} (Screenplay)\n* {{cite book|last=Zwerenz|first=Gerhard|title=Die Ehe der Maria Braun|publisher=Goldmann Verlag|date=January 1979|isbn=3-442-03841-3|language=German}} (Novel based on the film)\n* {{cite book|title=The Marriage of Maria Braun: Rainer Werner Fassbinder, director|editor=Joyce Rheuban|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=January 1986|series=Rutgers Films in Print|isbn=0-8135-1130-5}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n*Anton Kaes.

Most of the characters were introduced in the first book, ''[[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]''.<ref name='story'>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/storyofdoctordol00loft|title=''The Story of Doctor Dolittle, Being the History of His Peculiar Life at Home and Astonishing Adventures in Foreign Parts''|work=archive.org}}</ref>{{clr}}\n\n==Humans==\n===Doctor Dolittle===\n;Portrayed by:\n* [[Rex Harrison]] ([[Doctor Dolittle (film)|1967]])\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] ([[Dr. Dolittle (film)|1998]], [[Dr. Dolittle 2|2001]])\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] ([[Dolittle (film)|2020]])\n'''Doctor John Dolittle''' is an English physician who became a doctor for animals after his parrot, Polynesia, taught him to speak animal languages. He lives in the fictional town of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh in England's [[West Country]], along with his many animal friends. He has very few human friends and spends most of his time treating animals, travelling the world with his animals and conducting research into new animals and new forms of animal languages.<ref name='story'/>\n\nHe is portrayed by [[Rex Harrison]] in the 1967 film ''[[Doctor Dolittle (film)|Doctor Dolittle]]'', [[Eddie Murphy]] in ''[[Dr. Dolittle (film)|Dr. Dolittle]]'' ([[1998 in film|1998]]) and ''[[Dr. Dolittle 2]]'' ([[2001 in film|2001]]), and by [[Robert Downey Jr.]] in ''[[Dolittle (film)|Dolittle]]'' ([[2020 in film|2020]]). The Murphy films bear little resemblance to Lofting's character or plots. In the [[Doctor Dolittle (TV series)|TV series]], Doctor Dolittle is voiced by [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]].\n\n===Tommy Stubbins===\n'''Tommy Stubbins''' is a boy from Puddleby who, after taking an injured squirrel to Doctor Dolittle, becomes the doctor's friend and assistant. His father is the doctor's favourite shoemaker. He first appears in ''[[The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle]]'' and acts as the narrator in all the books that take place after his arrival.<ref name=\"voyages\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/voyagesofdoctord00loft|title=''The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle'' : Lofting, Hugh, 1886-1947|work=Internet Archive|page=3}}</ref>{{clr}} He is portrayed by [[William Dix (actor)|William Dix]] in the 1967 film, and by [[Harry Collett]] in the 2020 film.\n\n===Matthew Mugg===\n'''Matthew Mugg''' is the [[Raw feeding|cat's-meat-man]] from Puddleby. He is a friend of Doctor Dolittle and helps to take care of the doctor's house and garden when the doctor is away travelling. He is illiterate but practical, and is the one who advised Dolittle to become an \"animal doctor\" and learn animal languages. He was played by [[Anthony Newley]] in the 1967 film.\n\n===Prince Bumpo===\n'''Prince Bumpo''' is an African prince from the kingdom of Jolliginki, who has been sent to study at [[Oxford University]] by his father, and becomes a friend of the Doctor's. Bumpo is recognisable by his green umbrella and bare feet - not used to wearing shoes, he usually discards them.\n\nHe was originally supposed to appear in the 1967 film intact, but casting problems eventually led to his character being considerably softened and renamed as \"William Shakespeare the Tenth\", played by [[Geoffrey Holder]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blog.plover.com/book/Dolittle.html | title=The Bowdlerization of Dr. Dolittle | date=23 Jan 2006 | accessdate=12 February 2015 | author=Dominus, Mark}}</ref>\n\n===Colonel Bellowes===\n'''Colonel Bellowes''' is a snobbish old man in Puddleby who appears briefly in ''The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle''.\n\nIn the 1967 film, he became '''General Bellowes''', a retired military commander and a magistrate, played by [[Peter Bull]]. He loathes any sort of new, unusual, or odd ideas, including veterinary science; he rejects that a veterinarian can talk to animals. He owns several dogs, horses and other animals, all of whom betray their owner when Dolittle queries them at his trial about their owner's excesses of food, drink and female companionship. General Bellowes deals harshly with Dolittle, who then flees the country before he can be committed to an asylum. By the end of the film, General Bellows decides to pardon Doctor Dolittle when all the local animals go on strike.\n\n===Emma Fairfax===\nEmma is portrayed in the 1967 film by [[Samantha Eggar]], as the niece of General Bellowes, for a romantic interest to The Doctor.\n\n===Lily Dolittle===\nThe deceased wife of the Doctor in the 2020 film, who is played by [[Kasia Smutniak]]. She is described as an adventurous explorer who shared Dolittle's love for animals, and the daughter of Rassouli, king of pirates. She died during a naval voyage she undertook on her own, when her ship was hit by a typhoon.\n\n===Long Arrow===\n'''Long Arrow''' is an American Indian, son of Golden Arrow. He is the world's greatest naturalist, specializing in botany and traveling through the mountains of Peru and Spider Monkey Island. He has learned the language of eagles and thus is able to communicate with Dr. Dolittle. He is featured in ''[[The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle]]''.\n\n===William Shakespeare the Tenth===\n'''William Shakespeare the Tenth''' is the tribal leader of Sea Star Island, a floating tropical paradise. He and his tribe are well educated in literature and history and each citizen is able to speak several languages ever since different books have washed up on Sea Star Island. Parents name their children after their favorite authors, hence his name.\n\nHe is nicknamed \"Willy\" and was played by [[Geoffrey Holder]] in the 1967 film. He never appeared in any of Lofting's original books and is loosely based on Prince Bumpo.\n===Sarah Dolittle===\nJohn Dolittle's sister and former housekeeper, first featured in ''[[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]''. When Dolittle allows the crocodile to reside on his premises, which scares his clients away and throws the household back into poverty, she leaves in disgust and gets married when Dolittle refuses to evict the reptile.\n\n==Doctor Dolittle's animals\n\n===Polynesia===\n'''Polynesia''' is Doctor Dolittle's first animal friend, an African grey parrot. She is able to speak English and was the one who first taught Doctor Dolittle the language of animals. She always says she can never remember how old she is, but she remembers that when she came to England, she saw [[Charles II of England]], hiding in an oak tree from the [[Roundhead]]s: \"he looked very frightened\". Along with Chee-Chee and the crocodile, she decided to stay in Africa at the end of the original book, but returned in later stories. In ''The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle'' she is described as grey and scarlet. In the [[Doctor Dolittle (film)|1967 film]] and the [[Dolittle (film)|2020 film]] (where she is voiced by [[Emma Thompson]] and narrates the story), she is portrayed as a macaw; the first film has her explicitly state that she is 199 years old and remembers everything from when she arrived in England and saw King Charles II in hiding, and the stage musical features her mourning how Dolittle will miss her two-hundredth birthday due to his exile.\n=Yoshi\u201d\n'''yoshi''' is a polar bear doctor Dolittle found in a ice cave he was scared cold and alone he\u2019s been with doctor Dolittle ever since he might not be bright but he\u2019s the best friend ever his problem was he was always cold and he couldn\u2019t get along with Plimpton\n\n===Gub-Gub===\nis Doctor Dolittle's pet pig. He is a great lover of food. ''[[Gub Gub's Book]]: An Encyclopedia of Food'' is written as if it were a record of conversations with Gub-Gub on its contents.\n==Yoshi=\n\u201cYoshi\u201d is a polar bear doctor Dolittle found in a cave cold and alone so doctor Dolittle gave him a orange hat even though he might not be so bright he\u2019s one good friend his problem was getting along with Plimpton and staying warm both achieved (kinda)\n===Jip===\n'''Jip''' is Doctor Dolittle's dog. He has a very keen sense of smell. In ''[[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]'',  he was able to rescue a man stranded on an island by following the man's scent across the ocean.<ref name=\"story\"/> He appears as a Labrador Retriever in the 1967 film. In the [[Dolittle (film)|2020 film]], he appears as a different breed and wears glasses, and is voiced by [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]].\n\nIn the [[Dr. Dolittle (1998 film)|1998 movie]] and all four of its sequels, Dolittle has a different dog named Lucky (voiced by [[Norm MacDonald]]).\n\n===Chee-Chee===\n'''Chee-Chee''' is a monkey from Africa whom Doctor Dolittle buys from an organ-grinder in [[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]. His name apparently means \"ginger\" in monkey language.<ref name=\"story\"/> He appears as a chimpanzee in the 1967 film. In the [[Dolittle (film)|2020 film]], he appears as a gorilla voiced by [[Rami Malek]].\n\n===Dab-Dab===\n'''Dab-Dab''' is Doctor Dolittle's pet duck. After the doctor's sister, Sarah Dolittle, leaves the house in Puddleby due to her dislike of crocodiles, Dab-Dab becomes the doctor's housekeeper. She will appear in the [[Dolittle (film)|upcoming 2020 film]] voiced by [[Octavia Spencer]].\n\n===Too-Too===\n'''Too-Too''' is the doctor's pet owl. He acts as the Doctor's accountant, and can tell the Doctor immediately how much money he has in the money box.\n\n===Cheapside===\n'''Cheapside''' is a Cockney sparrow from [[East London]]. He often visits the doctor, to gossip or bring important news. He is notorious for using bad language. Cheapside and his wife Becky live at [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's]], in the statue of [[Edmund the Martyr|St. Edmund]]'s left ear. He is a recurring character in the books.\n\n===The Pushmi-Pullyu===\n[[File:Story of Dr Dolittle p107.jpg|thumb|right|The Pushmi-Pullyu]]\nThe '''pushmi-pullyu''' (pronounced \"push-me\u2014pull-you\") is a \"gazelle/unicorn cross\" with two heads (one of each) at opposite ends of its body. In ''[[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]'', the grateful monkeys in Africa persuade it to accompany Dr. Dolittle to England to earn money for him (in ''Doctor Dolittle's Circus'' and ''Doctor Dolittle's Caravan''). The pushmi-pullyu usually only uses one of its heads to talk, reserving the other for eating (thus allowing  it to eat while speaking without being rude) and claims that its great-grandfather was the last unicorn.\n\nIn the [[Doctor Dolittle (film)|1967 film]], the pushmi-pullyu was instead portrayed as a double-headed llama. The doctor can immediately speak to the pushmi-pullyu, knowing that llamas speak a dialect of camel language. This is the version that appears in the [[Doctor Dolittle (TV series)|TV series]] where he is voiced by [[Don Messick]].\n\nThe 1998 [[Dr. Dolittle (film)|Eddie Murphy film]] has a brief scene where a pushmi-pullyu is walking in the background while Dr. Dolittle talks to the tiger in the cage. This is in keeping with the fact that [[Eddie Murphy]]'s version is only very loosely based on the books.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/07/uk_enl_1190200819/html/1.stm|title=BBC News - Enlarged Image|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>{{clr}}\n\n===Toggle===\nToggle is a visually-impaired plowhorse who gets spectacles in ''The Story of Doctor Dolittle''. In the film, he is owned by General Bellowes.\n\n===Great Glass Sea Snail===\nThis enormous undersea mollusk with a transparent airtight shell is injured when the mysterious floating Spider Monkey Island finally comes to rest in ''The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle''. The animals arrange for him to ferry Dr. Dolittle and his party back through the ocean to Puddleby.\n\nIn the 1967 film, Dolittle resigns himself to living abroad for the rest of his life due to the price on his head issued by General Bellowes. The [renamed] Great Pink Sea Snail takes Matthew, Tommy, Emma and a host of small animals from the [renamed] Sea Star Island back to England.\n\n===Sophie the Seal===\nSophie the Seal is rescued by Dolittle in ''Dr Dolittle's Circus''. She makes it apparent to the doctor that she does not like life at the circus and wants to return to the sea to find her husband.  Dolittle disguises her as a woman and takes her to the sea, but a villager in Brighton witnesses Dolittle throwing her off a cliff and gets him arrested for murder. The doctor is released from jail by the local magistrate, Sir William Peabody, who is an old school friend. In the book this is the last we hear of Sophie, and it is presumed she makes it back to Alaska.\n\nHowever in the 1967 film, Dolittle is tried and found guilty of insanity by General Bellowes, who commits him to an insane asylum. The animals catch wind of it and help Dolittle hightail it out of town before he can be incarcerated, embarking upon a series of worldwide adventures on the open sea.\n\nWhen Sophie catches up to him again, he is ensconced upon Sea Star Island.

Most of the characters were introduced in the first book, ''[[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]''.<ref name='story'>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/storyofdoctordol00loft|title=''The Story of Doctor Dolittle, Being the History of His Peculiar Life at Home and Astonishing Adventures in Foreign Parts''|work=archive.org}}</ref>{{clr}}\n\n==Humans==\n===Doctor Dolittle===\n;Portrayed by:\n* [[Rex Harrison]] ([[Doctor Dolittle (film)|1967]])\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] ([[Dr. Dolittle (film)|1998]], [[Dr. Dolittle 2|2001]])\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] ([[Dolittle (film)|2020]])\n'''Doctor John Dolittle''' is an English physician who became a doctor for animals after his parrot, Polynesia, taught him to speak animal languages. He lives in the fictional town of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh in England's [[West Country]], along with his many animal friends. He has very few human friends and spends most of his time treating animals, travelling the world with his animals and conducting research into new animals and new forms of animal languages.<ref name='story'/>\n\nHe is portrayed by [[Rex Harrison]] in the 1967 film ''[[Doctor Dolittle (film)|Doctor Dolittle]]'', [[Eddie Murphy]] in ''[[Dr. Dolittle (film)|Dr. Dolittle]]'' ([[1998 in film|1998]]) and ''[[Dr. Dolittle 2]]'' ([[2001 in film|2001]]), and by [[Robert Downey Jr.]] in ''[[Dolittle (film)|Dolittle]]'' ([[2020 in film|2020]]). The Murphy films bear little resemblance to Lofting's character or plots. In the [[Doctor Dolittle (TV series)|TV series]], Doctor Dolittle is voiced by [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]].\n\n===Tommy Stubbins===\n'''Tommy Stubbins''' is a boy from Puddleby who, after taking an injured squirrel to Doctor Dolittle, becomes the doctor's friend and assistant. His father is the doctor's favourite shoemaker. He first appears in ''[[The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle]]'' and acts as the narrator in all the books that take place after his arrival.<ref name=\"voyages\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/voyagesofdoctord00loft|title=''The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle'' : Lofting, Hugh, 1886-1947|work=Internet Archive|page=3}}</ref>{{clr}} He is portrayed by [[William Dix (actor)|William Dix]] in the 1967 film, and by [[Harry Collett]] in the 2020 film.\n\n===Matthew Mugg===\n'''Matthew Mugg''' is the [[Raw feeding|cat's-meat-man]] from Puddleby. He is a friend of Doctor Dolittle and helps to take care of the doctor's house and garden when the doctor is away travelling. He is illiterate but practical, and is the one who advised Dolittle to become an \"animal doctor\" and learn animal languages. He was played by [[Anthony Newley]] in the 1967 film.\n\n===Prince Bumpo===\n'''Prince Bumpo''' is an African prince from the kingdom of Jolliginki, who has been sent to study at [[Oxford University]] by his father, and becomes a friend of the Doctor's. Bumpo is recognisable by his green umbrella and bare feet - not used to wearing shoes, he usually discards them.\n\nHe was originally supposed to appear in the 1967 film intact, but casting problems eventually led to his character being considerably softened and renamed as \"William Shakespeare the Tenth\", played by [[Geoffrey Holder]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blog.plover.com/book/Dolittle.html | title=The Bowdlerization of Dr. Dolittle | date=23 Jan 2006 | accessdate=12 February 2015 | author=Dominus, Mark}}</ref>\n\n===Colonel Bellowes===\n'''Colonel Bellowes''' is a snobbish old man in Puddleby who appears briefly in ''The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle''.\n\nIn the 1967 film, he became '''General Bellowes''', a retired military commander and a magistrate, played by [[Peter Bull]]. He loathes any sort of new, unusual, or odd ideas, including veterinary science; he rejects that a veterinarian can talk to animals. He owns several dogs, horses and other animals, all of whom betray their owner when Dolittle queries them at his trial about their owner's excesses of food, drink and female companionship. General Bellowes deals harshly with Dolittle, who then flees the country before he can be committed to an asylum. By the end of the film, General Bellows decides to pardon Doctor Dolittle when all the local animals go on strike.\n\n===Emma Fairfax===\nEmma is portrayed in the 1967 film by [[Samantha Eggar]], as the niece of General Bellowes, for a romantic interest to The Doctor.\n\n===Lily Dolittle===\nThe deceased wife of the Doctor in the 2020 film, who is played by [[Kasia Smutniak]]. She is described as an adventurous explorer who shared Dolittle's love for animals, and the daughter of Rassouli, king of pirates. She died during a naval voyage she undertook on her own, when her ship was hit by a typhoon.\n\n===Long Arrow===\n'''Long Arrow''' is an American Indian, son of Golden Arrow. He is the world's greatest naturalist, specializing in botany and traveling through the mountains of Peru and Spider Monkey Island. He has learned the language of eagles and thus is able to communicate with Dr. Dolittle. He is featured in ''[[The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle]]''.\n\n===William Shakespeare the Tenth===\n'''William Shakespeare the Tenth''' is the tribal leader of Sea Star Island, a floating tropical paradise. He and his tribe are well educated in literature and history and each citizen is able to speak several languages ever since different books have washed up on Sea Star Island. Parents name their children after their favorite authors, hence his name.\n\nHe is nicknamed \"Willy\" and was played by [[Geoffrey Holder]] in the 1967 film. He never appeared in any of Lofting's original books and is loosely based on Prince Bumpo.\n===Sarah Dolittle===\nJohn Dolittle's sister and former housekeeper, first featured in ''[[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]''. When Dolittle allows the crocodile to reside on his premises, which scares his clients away and throws the household back into poverty, she leaves in disgust and gets married when Dolittle refuses to evict the reptile.\n\n==Doctor Dolittle's animals==\n===Polynesia===\n'''Polynesia''' is Doctor Dolittle's first animal friend, an African grey parrot. She is able to speak English and was the one who first taught Doctor Dolittle the language of animals. She always says she can never remember how old she is, but she remembers that when she came to England, she saw [[Charles II of England]], hiding in an oak tree from the [[Roundhead]]s: \"he looked very frightened\". Along with Chee-Chee and the crocodile, she decided to stay in Africa at the end of the original book, but returned in later stories. In ''The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle'' she is described as grey and scarlet. In the [[Doctor Dolittle (film)|1967 film]] and the [[Dolittle (film)|2020 film]] (where she is voiced by [[Emma Thompson]] and narrates the story), she is portrayed as a macaw; the first film has her explicitly state that she is 199 years old and remembers everything from when she arrived in England and saw King Charles II in hiding, and the stage musical features her mourning how Dolittle will miss her two-hundredth birthday due to his exile.\n\n===Gub-Gub===\n'''Gub-Gub''' is Doctor Dolittle's pet pig. He is a great lover of food. ''[[Gub Gub's Book]]: An Encyclopedia of Food'' is written as if it were a record of conversations with Gub-Gub on its contents.\n\n===Jip===\n'''Jip''' is Doctor Dolittle's dog. He has a very keen sense of smell. In ''[[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]'',  he was able to rescue a man stranded on an island by following the man's scent across the ocean.<ref name=\"story\"/> He appears as a Labrador Retriever in the 1967 film. In the [[Dolittle (film)|2020 film]], he appears as a different breed and wears glasses, and is voiced by [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]].\n\nIn the [[Dr. Dolittle (1998 film)|1998 movie]] and all four of its sequels, Dolittle has a different dog named Lucky (voiced by [[Norm MacDonald]]).\n\n===Chee-Chee===\n'''Chee-Chee''' is a monkey from Africa whom Doctor Dolittle buys from an organ-grinder in [[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]. His name apparently means \"ginger\" in monkey language.<ref name=\"story\"/> He appears as a chimpanzee in the 1967 film. In the [[Dolittle (film)|2020 film]], he appears as a gorilla voiced by [[Rami Malek]].\n\n===Dab-Dab===\n'''Dab-Dab''' is Doctor Dolittle's pet duck. After the doctor's sister, Sarah Dolittle, leaves the house in Puddleby due to her dislike of crocodiles, Dab-Dab becomes the doctor's housekeeper. She will appear in the [[Dolittle (film)|upcoming 2020 film]] voiced by [[Octavia Spencer]].\n\n===Too-Too===\n'''Too-Too''' is the doctor's pet owl. He acts as the Doctor's accountant, and can tell the Doctor immediately how much money he has in the money box.\n\n===Cheapside===\n'''Cheapside''' is a Cockney sparrow from [[East London]]. He often visits the doctor, to gossip or bring important news. He is notorious for using bad language. Cheapside and his wife Becky live at [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's]], in the statue of [[Edmund the Martyr|St. Edmund]]'s left ear. He is a recurring character in the books.\n\n===The Pushmi-Pullyu===\n[[File:Story of Dr Dolittle p107.jpg|thumb|right|The Pushmi-Pullyu]]\nThe '''pushmi-pullyu''' (pronounced \"push-me\u2014pull-you\") is a \"gazelle/unicorn cross\" with two heads (one of each) at opposite ends of its body. In ''[[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]'', the grateful monkeys in Africa persuade it to accompany Dr. Dolittle to England to earn money for him (in ''Doctor Dolittle's Circus'' and ''Doctor Dolittle's Caravan''). The pushmi-pullyu usually only uses one of its heads to talk, reserving the other for eating (thus allowing  it to eat while speaking without being rude) and claims that its great-grandfather was the last unicorn.\n\nIn the [[Doctor Dolittle (film)|1967 film]], the pushmi-pullyu was instead portrayed as a double-headed llama. The doctor can immediately speak to the pushmi-pullyu, knowing that llamas speak a dialect of camel language. This is the version that appears in the [[Doctor Dolittle (TV series)|TV series]] where he is voiced by [[Don Messick]].\n\nThe 1998 [[Dr. Dolittle (film)|Eddie Murphy film]] has a brief scene where a pushmi-pullyu is walking in the background while Dr. Dolittle talks to the tiger in the cage. This is in keeping with the fact that [[Eddie Murphy]]'s version is only very loosely based on the books.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/07/uk_enl_1190200819/html/1.stm|title=BBC News - Enlarged Image|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>{{clr}}\n\n===Toggle===\nToggle is a visually-impaired plowhorse who gets spectacles in ''The Story of Doctor Dolittle''. In the film, he is owned by General Bellowes.\n\n===Great Glass Sea Snail===\nThis enormous undersea mollusk with a transparent airtight shell is injured when the mysterious floating Spider Monkey Island finally comes to rest in ''The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle''. The animals arrange for him to ferry Dr. Dolittle and his party back through the ocean to Puddleby.\n\nIn the 1967 film, Dolittle resigns himself to living abroad for the rest of his life due to the price on his head issued by General Bellowes. The [renamed] Great Pink Sea Snail takes Matthew, Tommy, Emma and a host of small animals from the [renamed] Sea Star Island back to England.\n\n===Sophie the Seal===\nSophie the Seal is rescued by Dolittle in ''Dr Dolittle's Circus''. She makes it apparent to the doctor that she does not like life at the circus and wants to return to the sea to find her husband.  Dolittle disguises her as a woman and takes her to the sea, but a villager in Brighton witnesses Dolittle throwing her off a cliff and gets him arrested for murder. The doctor is released from jail by the local magistrate, Sir William Peabody, who is an old school friend. In the book this is the last we hear of Sophie, and it is presumed she makes it back to Alaska.\n\nHowever in the 1967 film, Dolittle is tried and found guilty of insanity by General Bellowes, who commits him to an insane asylum. The animals catch wind of it and help Dolittle hightail it out of town before he can be incarcerated, embarking upon a series of worldwide adventures on the open sea.\n\nWhen Sophie catches up to him again, he is ensconced upon Sea Star Island. As the Great Pink Sea Snail leaves with his human and animal cargo, Sophie along with her husband and pups informs him that every animal in Puddleby has gone on strike to protest the treatment of Dolittle by General Bellows. Overjoyed, he enlists the services of the Great Lunar Moth to help him return to Britain.\n\n===Giant Lunar Moth===\nIn Lofting's original books, the Giant Moth named Jamaro Bumblelily makes the arduous trip between Earth and the Moon in ''Doctor Dolittle's Garden'' and ''Doctor Dolittle in the Moon''.\n\nIn the 1967 film, the Giant Lunar Moth travels regularly back and forth between Earth and the Moon. When Doctor Dolittle gets good news from England that the animals have gone on strike and General Bellows has decided to pardon Doctor Dolittle, he ends his exile on Sea Star Island by persuading the moth to make a slight detour and drop him off in Puddleby.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0603431h.html ''Doctor Dolittle's Garden'']\n*[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0607691h.html ''Doctor Dolittle in the Moon'']\n\n{{Doctor Dolittle books}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Characters In The Doctor Dolittle Series}}\n[[Category:Doctor Dolittle|*List]]\n[[Category:Characters in fantasy literature|Doctor Dolittle]]\n[[Category:Lists of fictional animals in literature|Doctor Dolittle]]\n[[Category:Lists of fictional animals by work|Doctor Dolittle]]\n[[Category:Characters in children's literature|Doctor Dolittle]]\n", "name_user": "Sbjansanababs", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePolynesia)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Dolittle_characters"}

The [[steeple]] is {{convert|70|m|ft}} in height. Originally the cathedral had 2,029&nbsp;seats and room for an additional 1,216 people to stand, but seating has now been reduced so the building can comfortably seat about 1,000.

The first, called {{lang|no|Trefoldigetskirken}} (Trinity Church), a small wooden church, was built in 1645. When Kristiansand was appointed the seat of the diocese in 1682, construction began on the town's first cathedral, called {{lang|no|Vor Frelsers Kirke}} (Our Saviour's Church). That first cathedral, built in stone, was consecrated in 1696, but burned down in 1734. The second cathedral ''Vor Frues Kirke'' (Our Lady's Church), consecrated in 1738, was destroyed by a fire that affected the whole city, on 18&nbsp;December 1880. This cathedral has been reconstructed and rebuilt in size 1:10. The model is on display at the [[Vest-Agder Museum Kristiansand]]. It was built by a group of enthusiastic model builders.\n\nThe current cathedral, which is larger than its predecessor, was consecrated in 1885. When the 1940 [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Norwegian Campaign|attack on Kristiansand]] took place early in the morning of 9&nbsp;April 1940, the {{convert|70|m|adj=on}}-tall cathedral tower was hit by an [[artillery shell]], which damaged the upper part.<ref>{{cite web|first=Flemming|last=Jensen|url=http://www.agderkultur.no/Kristiansand%20domkirke/Side1.htm|title=Domkirkens historie|publisher=AgderKultur.no|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2017-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211162053/http://www.agderkultur.no/Kristiansand%20domkirke/Side1.htm|archive-date=2011-02-11|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agderkultur.no/Kirkerommet/Side%201.htm|title=Kristiansand domkirke Kirkerommet|publisher=Vest-Agder Fylkesmuseum|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2017-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426052124/http://www.agderkultur.no/Kirkerommet/Side%201.htm|archive-date=2012-04-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" mode=packed>\nFile:Kristiansand domkyrkje interioer 2.jpg|Interior\nFile:Kristiansand domkyrkje orgelet..jpg|Organ  \nFile:Kristiansand domkyrkje preikestol.jpg|Pulpit \nFile:Kristiansand Domkirke - Inne.jpg|Sanctuary\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of cathedrals in Norway]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Kristiansand domkirke}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.kristiansanddomkirke.no/index.html}} {{in lang|no}}\n*{{Official website|http://kristiansandcathedral.weebly.com/}} {{in lang|en}}\n*[https://roundme.com/tour/33846/view/82230/ Virtual Interior Kristiansand Cathedral, 360\u00b0 Panorama (New church organs)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzlsHceN8gc View from the Church Tower] VIDEO\n\n{{Cathedrals of Norway}}\n{{Churches in Kristiansand}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Kristiansand|Cathedral]]\n[[Category:Churches in Kristiansand]]\n[[Category:Churches in Vest-Agder]]\n[[Category:Cathedrals in Norway]]\n[[Category:Lutheran cathedrals in Norway]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1885]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Kristiansand]]\n[[Category:Cruciform churches in Norway]]\n[[Category:1645 establishments in Norway]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox church\n|name                   = Kristiansand Cathedral\n|fullname               = Kristiansand domkirke\n|image                  = File:Kristiansand Church.jpg\n|imagesize              = \n|imagealt               = \n|caption                = View of the cathedral\n|pushpin map            = Agder#Norway\n|pushpin label position = left\n|pushpin mapsize        = \n|map caption            = Location of the church\n|coordinates            = {{coord|58.1461|07.9947|region:NO_type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n|location               = [[Kristiansand]], [[Agder]]\n|country                = [[Norway]]\n|denomination           = [[Church of Norway]]\n|churchmanship          = [[Evangelical Lutheran]]\n|website                = [http://www.kristiansanddomkirke.no/ www.kristiansanddomkirke.no]\n|former name            = Trinity Church,<br /> Our Saviors Church\n|founded date           = \n|consecrated date       = 18 Mar 1885\n|completed date         = 1 Feb 1885\n|events                 = \n|status                 = [[Cathedral]]\n|functional status      = Active\n|architect              = [[Henrik Thrap-Meyer]]\n|architectural type     = \n|style                  = [[Neo-Gothic]], [[Cruciform]]\n|materials              = Brick, cement\n|closed date            = \n|capacity               = 1,000\n|parish                 = Kristiansand domkirken\n|deanery                = [[Kristiansand prosti]] \n|diocese                = [[Diocese of Agder og Telemark|Agder og Telemark]]\n|bishop                 = \n|dean                   = \n}} \n\n'''Kristiansand Cathedral''' ({{lang-no|Kristiansand domkirke}}) is a [[cathedral]] in [[Kristiansand]] municipality in [[Agder]] county, [[Norway]].

This cathedral is the fourth church and third cathedral to be located on this site over the centuries.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkesok.no/eng/kirker/Kristiansand-domkirke|title=Kristiansand domkirke|publisher=Kirkes\u00f8k: Kirkebyggdatabasen|accessdate=2017-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkekonsulenten.no/kirker.htm|title=Oversikt over N\u00e5v\u00e6rende Kirker|language=Norwegian|publisher=KirkeKonsulenten.no |accessdate=2017-01-29}}</ref><ref name=\"KB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kristiansanddomkirke.no/kirkebygget.html|title=Kirkebygget|publisher=Kristiansand kirkelige fellesr\u00e5d|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2017-01-29}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nKristiansand Cathedral is a [[Neo-Gothic]] church built of brick and cement, of [[cruciform]] plan with 1,750 seats. The church was designed by the architect [[Henrik Thrap-Meyer]]. Construction began in 1880 and was completed on 1 February 1885. The church was [[consecrate]]d on 18 March 1885 by the provost Johan M. Brun who was serving as acting bishop.<ref name=\"KB\" /><ref name=\"nbl\">{{cite web|url=https://nbl.snl.no/Henrik_Thrap-Meyer|title=Henrik Thrap-Meyer|author=Norsk biografisk leksikon|authorlink=Norsk biografisk leksikon|editor-last=Indahl|editor-first=Trond|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2017-01-29}}</ref>\n\nThe cathedral is {{convert|60|m}} long and {{convert|38.7|m}} wide.  The [[steeple]] is {{convert|70|m|ft}} in height. Originally the cathedral had 2,029&nbsp;seats and room for an additional 1,216 people to stand, but seating has now been reduced so the building can comfortably seat about 1,000. To re-use the walls of the previous cathedral, which burned down in 1880, the [[altar]] was positioned at the west end, rather than in the traditional position in the east.<ref name=\"KB\" />\n\nThe cathedral received a [[carillon]] with 36 bells as a gift from [[Glencore|Falconbridge Nikkelverk]] in 1990, created by [[Olsen Nauen Bell Foundry]].<ref name=hist>[http://www.kristiansanddomkirke.no/aringpen-kirke.html Kristiansand Domkirke \u2013 en kort historisk beskrivelse] from the Official Website {{in lang|no}}</ref>\n\nKristiansand Cathedral received a new [[church organ]], built by the German supplier Klais in 2013, comprising a 58-voice main organ at the eastern balcony and another of 9 voices at the northern balcony.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kristiansand domkirke, Vest-Agder - Riksantikvaren-T150 01 0346.jpg|thumb|left|The previous Kristiansand Cathedral, built 1738, burned down 1880<br>(<small>Image:[[Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage]])</small>]]\nThe cathedral is in the same location as three previous buildings. The first, called {{lang|no|Trefoldigetskirken}} (Trinity Church), a small wooden church, was built in 1645. When Kristiansand was appointed the seat of the diocese in 1682, construction began on the town's first cathedral, called {{lang|no|Vor Frelsers Kirke}} (Our Saviour's Church). That first cathedral, built in stone, was consecrated in 1696, but burned down in 1734. The second cathedral \"Vor Frues Kirke'' (Our Lady's Church), consecrated in 1738, was destroyed by a fire that affected the whole city, on 18&nbsp;December 1880. This cathedral has been reconstructed and rebuilt in size 1:10. The model is on display at the [[Vest-Agder Museum Kristiansand]]. It was built by a group of enthusiastic model builders.\n\nThe current cathedral, which is larger than its predecessor, was consecrated in 1885. When the 1940 [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Norwegian Campaign|attack on Kristiansand]] took place early in the morning of 9&nbsp;April 1940, the {{convert|70|m|adj=on}}-tall cathedral tower was hit by an [[artillery shell]], which damaged the upper part.<ref>{{cite web|first=Flemming|last=Jensen|url=http://www.agderkultur.no/Kristiansand%20domkirke/Side1.htm|title=Domkirkens historie|publisher=AgderKultur.no|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2017-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211162053/http://www.agderkultur.no/Kristiansand%20domkirke/Side1.htm|archive-date=2011-02-11|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agderkultur.no/Kirkerommet/Side%201.htm|title=Kristiansand domkirke Kirkerommet|publisher=Vest-Agder Fylkesmuseum|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2017-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426052124/http://www.agderkultur.no/Kirkerommet/Side%201.htm|archive-date=2012-04-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" mode=packed>\nFile:Kristiansand domkyrkje interioer 2.jpg|Interior\nFile:Kristiansand domkyrkje orgelet..jpg|Organ  \nFile:Kristiansand domkyrkje preikestol.jpg|Pulpit \nFile:Kristiansand Domkirke - Inne.jpg|Sanctuary\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of cathedrals in Norway]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Kristiansand domkirke}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.kristiansanddomkirke.no/index.html}} {{in lang|no}}\n*{{Official website|http://kristiansandcathedral.weebly.com/}} {{in lang|en}}\n*[https://roundme.com/tour/33846/view/82230/ Virtual Interior Kristiansand Cathedral, 360\u00b0 Panorama (New church organs)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzlsHceN8gc View from the Church Tower] VIDEO\n\n{{Cathedrals of Norway}}\n{{Churches in Kristiansand}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Kristiansand|Cathedral]]\n[[Category:Churches in Kristiansand]]\n[[Category:Churches in Vest-Agder]]\n[[Category:Cathedrals in Norway]]\n[[Category:Lutheran cathedrals in Norway]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1885]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Kristiansand]]\n[[Category:Cruciform churches in Norway]]\n[[Category:1645 establishments in Norway]]\n", "name_user": "Carsten R D", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristiansand_Cathedral"}
