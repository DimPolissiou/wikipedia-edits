A graduate of [[Oberlin College]], where she majored in classics, she was hired at [[Wilberforce University]] in 1858 as the first black woman college instructor and she was the first black American to teach at a historically black college or university (HBCU).<ref>She was not, however, the first black to teach at the college level. Three black American men taught at Central New York College prior to the Civil War, including George B. Vashon, a graduate of Oberlin College. The school was established by Gerit Smith and went out of operation just before the Civil War began. Wilberforce University, where Woodson taught continues in operation (as of 2018). Benjamin Quarles, ''Black Abolitionists'', New York/London: Oxford University Press, 1969.</ref>\n\nShe also taught for many years in community schools.  After marrying in 1868 and moving to Tennessee with her minister husband [[Jordan Winston Early]], she was principal of schools in four cities.  Early served as national superintendent (1888\u20131892) of the black division of the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) and gave more than 100 lectures across five states. She wrote a biography of her husband and his rise from slavery that is included among postwar [[slave narratives]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nSarah Jane Woodson, the fifth daughter and youngest child of eleven of Jemima (Riddle) and Thomas Woodson (1790\u20131879), was born free in [[Chillicothe, Ohio]], on November 15, 1825.  Her parents had moved to the free state of Ohio in 1820 after her father purchased the whole family's freedom for $900.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Three Sarahs: Documents of Antebellum Black College Women|last=Lawson|first=Ellen NicKenzie|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|year=1984|isbn=0-88946-536-3|location=New York|pages=157}}</ref> They left [[Greenbrier County, Virginia]], where the Woodsons were one of only two free black families in the entire county. <ref name=\"FonerBranham\"/> \n\nThey founded the first black [[Methodist]] church west of the [[Alleghenies]].<ref name=\"FonerBranham\"/> In 1830 the Woodsons were among the founders of a separate black farming community called Berlin Crossroads, since defunct. The nearly two dozen families living there by 1840 established their own school, stores and churches.

Over two hundred years after newspaper reports appeared in Virginia newspapers indicating the existence of Sally Hemings' son named Tom, allegedly the son of Thomas Jefferson, professional historians such as Annette Gordon-Reed have ignored the existence of some of the newspaper reports and critically important content of the ones that they have acknowledged. Gordon-Reed and others are \"hiding the balls\", a practice that Gordon-Reed criticized other historians for doing in her book ''Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings.''</ref> According to professional historians, this was not supported by known historical evidence.<ref name=\"MontBrief\"/> In 1998 [[DNA]] testing of descendants of the Jefferson, Hemings and Woodson male lines showed conclusively that there was no match between the Jefferson and Woodson lines; the Woodson male line did show western European paternal ancestry.<ref name=Foster>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/23835 |last=Foster |first=EA |last2=Jobling |year=1998 |first2=MA |last3=Taylor |first3=PG |last4=Donnelly |first4=P |last5=De Knijff |first5=P |last6=Mieremet |first6=R |last7=Zerjal |first7=T |last8=Tyler-Smith |first8=C |title=Jefferson fathered slave's last child|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=396 |issue=6706 |pages=27\u201328 |url=http://www.familytreedna.com/pdf/Jeffersons.pdf |pmid=9817200|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  According to historians at Monticello, no documents support the claim that Woodson was Hemings' first child, as he appeared to have been born before any known child of hers. Professional historians have ignored the erasure of the name of a male slave, who was born in 1790, whose named was recorded in Jefferson's ''Farm Book'' by Thomas Jefferson and the survival of at least one letter of the name of the mother of the son in the ''Farm Book,'' as well.

Slocombe and the production team chose a muted style of colour filming, which was not universally praised: opinions variously described it as unusual and different, or pretentiously symbolic and leaving exterior and interior shots poorly matched.<ref name=\"BurtonO'Sullivan2009 Saraband\">{{cite book|author1=Alan Burton|author2=Tim O'Sullivan|title=The Cinema of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXDdTR62pd4C&pg=PA39|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3289-3|pages=39\u201341}}</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\n*UK goth band [[Sex Gang Children]] have a song called \"Saraband for Dead Lovers\".\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n==References==\n*{{cite book|title=Saraband for dead lovers|first=Helen|last=Simpson|publisher=Doubleday, Doran & Company|year=1935}}\n*{{cite book|title=Saraband for dead lovers : the film and its production at Ealing Studios, produced by Michael Balcon, directed by Basil Dearden|publisher=Convoy Publications|year=1948}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0040758|title=Saraband for Dead Lovers}}\n*[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/12654%7C0/Saraband-for-Dead-Lovers.html ''Saraband for Dead Lovers''] at [[TCMDB]]\n*[https://archive.org/stream/variety171-1948-09#page/n133/mode/1up Review of film] at ''Variety''\n*[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks08/0800831h.html Complete original novel] at [[Project Gutenberg]]\n\n{{Basil Dearden}}\n{{Alexander Mackendrick}}\n{{Michael Balcon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saraband For Dead Lovers}}\n[[Category:1948 films]]\n[[Category:1940s historical films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:Ealing Studios films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1680s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1690s]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Basil Dearden]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Michael Balcon]]\n[[Category:British war drama films]]\n[[Category:British romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:War romance films]]\n[[Category:Adultery in films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films based on Australian novels]]\n[[Category:British historical films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Prague]]\n[[Category:1940s war films]]\n[[Category:1940s romantic drama films]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraband_for_Dead_Lovers"}

Produced by [[Associated Television Network|ATV]], it ran from 1979 to 1982 on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network. The series was created by [[Peter J. Hammond]] who conceived the programme under the working title ''The Time Menders'',<ref name=\"dreamwatch\">{{cite web | title=The element man | url=http://www.dwscifi.com/interviews/48-pj-hammond-the-element-man |publisher=[[Dreamwatch SciFi]]| accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref> after a stay in an allegedly haunted castle. Hammond also wrote all the stories except for the fifth, which was co-written by [[Don Houghton]] and [[Anthony Read]].\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, ''Sapphire & Steel'' returned in a series of audio dramas produced by [[Big Finish Productions]], starring [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] and [[Susannah Harker]] as the titular Steel and Sapphire.\n\n==Series overview==\n[[Image:Sapphireandsteel.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Joanna Lumley]] and [[David McCallum]] as Sapphire and Steel (from Adventure 3)]]\n=== Premise ===\n''All irregularities will be handled by the forces controlling each dimension. Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life. Medium atomic weights are available: Gold, Lead, Copper, Jet, Diamond, Radium, Sapphire, Silver and Steel. Sapphire and Steel have been assigned.''\n \nThe programme centres on a pair of interdimensional operatives, the eponymous  Sapphire and Steel. Very little is revealed about their purposes or backgrounds in the course of the series but they appear to be engaged in guarding the continuing flow of time. They are two of multiple elements that assume human form and are sent to investigate strange events; others include Lead (Val Pringle), who takes the aspect of a jovial, friendly giant, and Silver ([[David Collings]]), a technician who can melt metals in his hands.\n\nIn the series, it is explained that Time is like a progressing corridor that surrounds everything, but there are weak spots where Time \u2013 implied to be a malignant force \u2013 can break into the present and take things. There are also creatures from the beginnings and ends of time that roam the corridor looking for the same weak spots to break through.\n\nThese breaks are most often triggered by the presence of something old in a modern situation, for example a traditional nursery rhyme, an old photograph, or a house decorated with antiques. Holding onto something of the past opposes progress and allows 'Time' to break into the present - the more old things present, the easier it is for this to occur (such as is seen in episode 1 where the house is full of antiques in which a traditional nursery rhyme is read). When this breaking-in of 'Time' occurs, Investigators will be sent to assess the situation and then, if intervention is warranted, Operators are assigned to deal with the problem by a mysterious unseen authority, to be assisted by Specialists if necessary.\n\nEach adventure usually starts with Sapphire and Steel simply showing up, seemingly out of nowhere, although sometimes they are already present when the story begins. They will then investigate and mingle with various humans, although it is nearly always the location the humans are in which is of the most interest: an old house which dates back to the 18th century, an abandoned [[railway station]], a modern-day motorway petrol station, and so on. The stories are generally quite cryptic, raising more questions than answers, and have an eerie air to them, being as much [[Ghost story|ghost stories]] as they are science fiction.  The ambiguous nature of the programme extends to its main characters. While Sapphire is portrayed as more affable and \"human\" than the no-nonsense, grim Steel, it is clear that their prime concern is to deal with the break in Time, sometimes over the safety of the humans caught in the incidents they investigate. The general tone of the series is however forward-looking; that old things are dangerous, and that the past should be left behind or an evil force will be able to enter though those old things. In this situation, progress and newness are portrayed as the protecting force against 'Time'.\n\n===Characters===\nIt is heavily implied that Sapphire and Steel are not human, given their abilities and manner. Steel, for example, often has gaps in his knowledge of human culture and even Sapphire's grace is tempered with a cool detachment from the humans they interact with. In Adventure 5, Steel confirms that they were alien, \"in the [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] sense.\" The two also refer to being involved in the mystery of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]'', and in one case state they will be waiting for a ship to surface in seventy-five years. This could mean they are either exceptionally long-lived or some kind of [[time travel]] is involved. P. J. Hammond confirmed the former hypothesis in a 1993 interview.<ref name=\"Hammond interview\">{{cite web\n | year =1993\n | url =http://www.cix.co.uk/~nirvana/TVFilms/SappNSteel/hammond.html\n | title =P. J. Hammond interview\n | author = Rob Stanley\n | accessdate =2006-09-12\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060502054558/http://www.cix.co.uk/~nirvana/TVFilms/SappNSteel/hammond.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nSapphire and Steel, who are Operators, are occasionally assisted by other beings, including Lead and Silver. Silver is stated in Adventure 6 as being a Specialist rather than an Operator. There are 127 operatives in total, including 12 [[Transuranium element|transuranic elements]], which cannot be assigned where life exists. Although they are described as [[chemical element|elements]], many of the code names are non-elements, such as [[Sapphire]], [[Steel]], and [[Jet (lignite)|Jet]], although these could be pseudonyms for aesthetics or discretion. Sapphire also has a flirtatious relationship with Silver, contributing to an air of underlying sexual tension on the occasions that Silver is called upon to assist the duo. The relationship between Steel and Sapphire similarly exhibits occasional tension, as evidenced in Adventure 2 when Steel admits feeling love for Sapphire and, at one point, even kissing her on the cheek. In Adventure 1, Lead mentioned that Jet sent Steel her love and that Silver was having relationship troubles with Copper \"again\".\n\nAmong Sapphire's abilities is the power to manipulate time in small ways as well as determine the age or historical details of an object by touching it ([[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]]). This latter ability is referred in Adventure 2 as \"spot analysis\". Her most prominent ability is to \"take back time,\" literally rewinding it in a localised area to see or replay the past. She states in Adventure 1 that she cannot take time back twenty-four hours; in the last episode of the same adventure, at Steel's request she takes time back \"half a day\". In Adventure 2, she is able to \"hold time for a day\", when another (in this case, the creature seen as the darkness) takes time back over multiple days. Whether this is an improvement in abilities or a different skill entirely is not made clear. She also exhibits an ability to obtain information about people \u2013 their ages and backgrounds as well as psychological insights into their personality \u2013 just by being close to them. Sometimes it appears that she does not discover this information herself but is receiving the information [[telepathy|telepathically]] from some external source. In Adventure 2, it is stated that the age at which a living person will die is not estimated but recorded, that it is a historical fact. Nothing else is revealed in the television series as to the extent or nature of any such records, or to what extent Sapphire uses them in relation to information obtained directly. She can also manipulate people's emotions, and project illusions. When she uses her powers, her irises will usually glow blue or, under some circumstances, turquoise.\n\nSteel, on the other hand, can freeze himself to [[absolute zero]] which gives him the ability to destroy '[[ghost]]s', which are in actuality remnants of Time. He apparently possesses immense strength (in Adventure 3 he ties knots in [[elevator|lift]] cables to prevent the lift from being used) and a degree of invulnerability. He also exhibits [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] abilities, being able to paralyse people with a look, weld metal with his bare hands or undo deadbolts with a gesture.\n\nBoth Sapphire and Steel (as well as all Operatives) also appear to be able to teleport a great distance.\n\nThe operatives can also communicate telepathically with each other, and in Adventure 5, Sapphire grants this ability to a human being, whom she dubs \"Brass\" for the duration. Sapphire removes this ability at the end of the story. It is also suggested in Adventure 5 that other powers can be granted. It is hinted, in the debate that ensues between Sapphire and Steel after Sapphire gives Brass his abilities, that different powers are classed at different levels, with telepathy being considered one of the most basic.\n\nIt is not made clear in the series as to what boundaries exist on the skills of operatives. In Adventure 2, Steel cannot perform \"spot analysis\", as it is not his field, but in Adventure 4, Sapphire and Steel together are specifically able to replicate Silver's ability to transmutate by remembering what he did.\n\nOther operatives that appear also have special powers. Silver (played by [[David Collings]]), a Specialist who is designated as a Technician, is good with electronics and gadgets, is able to transform one small object into another, and is even able to replicate small objects out of nothing. He can also create long-lasting visual images of objects too large to replicate, although the exact parameters for such images are never revealed. Lead (played by Val Pringle), on the other hand, possesses superhuman strength and can act as needed insulation for Steel when he freezes himself to extreme temperatures.\n\n==Production and transmission==\nThe programme ran for over a period of four years, with six serials consisting of a total of 34 episodes were made, each episode lasting approximately 25 minutes and generally including a reprised [[wikt:pr\u00e9cis|pr\u00e9cis]] of the preceding episode. The first and second stories were shown in the summer of 1979, the second story's transmission interrupted by industrial action at the ITV network which led to a repeat of the story in 1979. The third and fourth stories were transmitted in January 1981, and the fifth in August 1981 with a sixth story \"in the can\" for future transmission. The audience figures were unusually high for a science fiction series with the first episode, gaining 11.8 million viewers and finishing as the fourth most watched programme of the week across all channels. This continued with a further seven episodes of the first year appearing in the top 20. Three more episodes in 1981 and one in 1982 also entered the top 20 ratings.<ref name=\"Ratings\">''Television's Greatest Hits'', Network Books, [[Paul Gambaccini]] and [[Rod Taylor]], 1993. {{ISBN|0 563 36247 2}}</ref>\n\nBy this time, production costs were increasing. The programme had been allocated a minuscule production budget, which led to the use of simple staging and minimal [[special effect]]s, ultimately contributing to the uneasy atmosphere of the show. The high profile and limited availability of the principal actors, Lumley and McCallum, meant that shooting was somewhat sporadic, and the programme's producers ATV were in the process of being reorganised into the new [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]]; all factors which led to the series' demise.  Central felt that viewers might mistake the new programmes for repeats of old ones, and broadcast the final, four-part story in late August 1982 to very little fanfare. Despite this, the first episode gained a high rating and finished in the top 20 most-watched programmes of the week.<ref name=\"Ratings\" /> The show has never been repeated on UK terrestrial television, but some episodes were shown on the satellite and cable station [[Bravo (UK TV network)|Bravo]] in the mid-1990s. The programme has also been made available for free online by ShoutFactoryTV.com.\n\n==Television stories==\n\n: ''For more information see [[List of Sapphire & Steel serials]]''\nNone of the stories had on-screen titles, or any official titles assigned by the writers. The Region 1 Complete Series DVD release gives the titles \"Escape Through a Crack in Time\", \"The Railway Station\", \"The Creature's Revenge\", \"The Man Without a Face\", \"Dr. McDee Must Die\" and \"The Trap\", respectively. These titles have often been cited as having been created by science fiction magazine ''Time Screen''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fire-Breathing Dimetrodon Time: Sapphire & Steel 3.5 and 3.6 |url=https://firebreathingdimetrodon.wordpress.com/2019/02/08/sapphire-steel-3-5-and-3-6/}}</ref> Further reading reveals that in the booklet for the series, written by Tim Worthington, and included with the most recent DVD box set, on page 7 there is this quote regarding titles from creator P.J. Hammond \"I never gave titles to the stories. Neither did the production department. I think certain fanbases may have made up their own titles in order to discuss and analyse various stories.\" The various British home video releases title the stories as \"Adventure\" or \"Assignment\" I through VI.\n\nThe booklet also says, on the same page, \"some sources have claimed that these were taken from the original scripts, whereas others dismiss them as an invention on the part of a science fiction fanzine, although the editor of the fanzine in question denies that they were ever used within its pages\" and furthermore that \"the show's distributors have never knowingly used them.\"\n\nThe final television story ends on a [[cliffhanger]]. Apparently resentful of Sapphire and Steel's independence, a higher authority sends entities known as Transient Beings (similar to the operatives but until now trapped in the past), set a trap for them in a motorway caf\u00e9. The serial concludes with Silver dispatched to an unknown fate &ndash; and Sapphire and Steel being trapped in the caf\u00e9, floating through space, apparently for eternity. The cliffhanger has never been resolved, although Hammond has stated that vague plans existed for further adventures. This was also stated by Joanna Lumley in her autobiography,<ref>Stare Back and Smile ''by [[Joanna Lumley]], page 157, [[Viking Penguin]] books,'' 1989. {{ISBN|0-670-82174-8}}</ref> who remembered that they were told that this was merely an end-of-season cliffhanger, and that Sapphire and Steel would be freed at the start of the next series. However, in an interview with ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (#329, cover date: 30 April 2003), David Collings recalled that although another series was planned, Joanna Lumley and David McCallum both decided that they'd had enough and didn't wish to do any more.\n\n==Merchandise==\n[[Image:SapphireAndSteelBook.jpg|right|thumb|150px|''Sapphire & Steel'' [[novelization|novelisation]] of the first adventure]]\nOne novelisation of the series was released. The first story of the series was released by Star Books in 1979 and was written by Peter J. Hammond.\n\nA two-page coloured ''Sapphire & Steel'' picture strip, written by [[Angus Allan]] and drawn by [[Arthur Ranson]], appeared in the ''[[Look-In]]'' magazine. It ran for a total of 76 issues from 1979-1981 &ndash; with a break of 13 issues between runs &ndash; and formed 14 untitled stories. It would appear that Ranson used photographs of Joanna Lumley and David McCallum from the first television adventure for reference, as Sapphire and Steel are almost always depicted wearing the outfits from this story. In the third story, Lead makes a cameo appearance and displays a further power: turning British soldiers from the Napoleonic War into miniature (and presumably lead) toy soldiers. However, the picture strip version of Lead &ndash; though depicted as a powerfully built black man &ndash; was not based upon Val Pringle who played the part on television; it can only be assumed that Ranson had very little in the way of photographic reference material in this case. In addition, a one-off ''Sapphire & Steel'' text story titled ''The Albatross'' was published in the 1981 ''Look-In Annual''. This was illustrated in black and white by Arthur Ranson.\n\nThe first and only ''Sapphire & Steel'' Annual was published in late 1980 by World International Publishing Ltd. at \u00a31.95, and featured a number of text stories and features. The front cover used the same photograph as that on P.J. Hammond's 1979 Star Books novelisation of Adventure One.\n\nP.J. Hammond did not write the stories for ''Sapphire & Steel Annual 1981'', but he was sent proofs to read in advance of publication. His only reservations with the stories were that Sapphire and Steel were able to move back in time, which he felt tended to contradict the premise set in the television series that Time was only allowed to break into the present day. However, this did not worry Hammond too much as, like ''Look-In'', the Annual was aimed at younger readers.<ref name=\"Hammond interview\">{{cite web\n | year =1993\n | url =http://www.cix.co.uk/~nirvana/TVFilms/SappNSteel/hammond.html\n | title =P.

Stories were labelled \"Adventure\" in the first releases (in lieu of story titles) and \"Assignment\" for the second release.\n\nIn 2002, the series was released for the first time on DVD, in the UK. Originally, it was released as two box-sets, with the first three stories on one (20 episodes) and the final three on the other (14 episodes). Also in the UK, Network Distributing Ltd Home Entertainment released the complete series on DVD on 5 November 2007. The 6-disc set features a new documentary and commentaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.networkdvd.net/product_info.php?products_id=500|title=Sapphire and Steel: The Complete Series Special Edition: Network DVD<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Networkdvd.net|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref>  On 26 May 2008, the complete series boxset was re-released with new packaging.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sapphire-Steel-Complete-Repackaged-DVD/dp/B001BHTN6S|title=Sapphire and Steel: The Complete Series|date=26 May 2008|website=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=20 March 2017|via=Amazon}}</ref> In the US, [[A&E Television Networks|A&E Home Entertainment]], under license from [[ITV Studios Global Entertainment|Carlton International Media Limited]], released the entire series on Region 1 DVD on 28 December 2004 and [[Shout!

However, neither McCallum nor Lumley reprised their roles: McCallum was working in the [[United States]] and Lumley declined to play Sapphire again. The characters were recast, with [[Susannah Harker]] and [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] taking over the roles. The range is produced by [[Nigel Fairs]] and [[Jason Haigh-Ellery]].\n\nThe character of Gold (played by [[Mark Gatiss]]) appears in the first adventure ''[[The Passenger (Sapphire & Steel)|The Passenger]]'' and returns in ''[[Perfect Day (Sapphire & Steel)|Perfect Day]]'' and ''[[Zero (Sapphire and Steel)|Zero]]''. He is portrayed as impatient and inexperienced when dealing with both humans and the various manifestations of Time, even more detached and clinical in many ways than Steel, almost as if he is still in training. The character of Ruby (played by [[Lisa Bowerman]]) appears in the second series story ''[[Water Like a Stone]]'', reappearing in ''[[Cruel Immortality]]'' and ''[[Second Sight (Sapphire and Steel)|Second Sight]]''. Her character has an understanding and affinity to Time within the rhythms of music, and also comes across as rather dry and sardonic, especially when interacting with Steel. David Collings reprises his role as Silver in the third and fifth stories of the first series of audio plays and then again in the third story of the third series. During the production of each season, Nigel Fairs has had to step in at late notice to write a replacement script (writing ''[[Dead Man Walking (Sapphire & Steel)|Dead Man Walking]]'' from John Ainsworth's outline in series one, replacing [[Gary Russell]]'s ''Big Fun'' with ''Cruel Immortality'' in series two and replacing [[Joseph Lidster]]'s ''Reborn'' with ''Second Sight'' in series three).\n\nIt was originally said by Big Finish that the new stories would be set before the climactic final story of the television series, but the released plays are actually set after assignment 6, and at the start of ''The Passenger'', the characters comment that it has been a long time since they last worked together and, in ''[[Cruel Immortality]]'', imply that they were freed in some unspecified way by Silver.\n\nAt the end of ''[[The Mystery of the Missing Hour]]'', Sapphire and Steel once again find themselves trapped. The following story, ''[[Second Sight (Sapphire and Steel)|Second Sight]]'' sees the characters 'reborn' once more - this time in the guise of two young Australians, played by [[Blair McDonough]] and [[Anna Skellern]]. At the end of ''Second Sight'', however, Ruby was able to release the previous incarnations of Sapphire and Steel from their trap - with David Warner and Susannah Harker reprising their roles for the rest of the series.\n\nThe audio dramas featured some notable guest stars - including [[Hugo Myatt]], [[Muriel Pavlow]], [[Daphne Oxenford]], [[Lucy Gaskell]], [[Colin Baker]], [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]], [[Sam Kelly]], [[David Horovitch]], [[Mark Gatiss]] and [[Louise Jameson]].\n\n==Planned remakes==\n\nThe idea of a remake of ''Sapphire & Steel'' was floated a few times, but the plans never came to fruition. Original series creator Peter J. Hammond said that he had discussions with ITV about a remake in 2006,<ref>{{cite web |title=Steeling the show: Q&A Peter J. Hammond |url=https://guyhaley.wordpress.com/interviews-2/pj-hammond-2007/|date=2013-04-08}}</ref> but no developments followed.

Produced by [[Associated Television Network|ATV]], it ran from 1979 to 1982 on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network. The series was created by [[Peter J. Hammond]] who conceived the programme under the working title ''The Time Menders'',<ref name=\"dreamwatch\">{{cite web | title=The element man | url=http://www.dwscifi.com/interviews/48-pj-hammond-the-element-man |publisher=[[Dreamwatch SciFi]]| accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref> after a stay in an allegedly haunted castle. Hammond also wrote all the stories except for the fifth, which was co-written by [[Don Houghton]] and [[Anthony Read]].\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, ''Sapphire & Steel'' returned in a series of audio dramas produced by [[Big Finish Productions]], starring [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] and [[Susannah Harker]] as the titular Steel and Sapphire.\n\n==Series overview==\n[[Image:Sapphireandsteel.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Joanna Lumley]] and [[David McCallum]] as Sapphire and Steel (from Adventure 3)]]\n=== Premise ===\n''All irregularities will be handled by the forces controlling each dimension. Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life. Medium atomic weights are available: Gold, Lead, Copper, Jet, Diamond, Radium, Sapphire, Silver and Steel. Sapphire and Steel have been assigned.''\n \nThe programme centres on a pair of interdimensional operatives, the eponymous  Sapphire and Steel. Very little is revealed about their purposes or backgrounds in the course of the series but they appear to be engaged in guarding the continuing flow of time. They are two of multiple elements that assume human form and are sent to investigate strange events; others include Lead (Val Pringle), who takes the aspect of a jovial, friendly giant, and Silver ([[David Collings]]), a technician who can melt metals in his hands.\n\nIn the series, it is explained that Time is like a progressing corridor that surrounds everything, but there are weak spots where Time \u2013 implied to be a malignant force \u2013 can break into the present and take things. There are also creatures from the beginnings and ends of time that roam the corridor looking for the same weak spots to break through.\n\nThese breaks are most often triggered by the presence of something old in a modern situation, for example a traditional nursery rhyme, an old photograph, or a house decorated with antiques. Holding onto something of the past opposes progress and allows 'Time' to break into the present - the more old things present, the easier it is for this to occur (such as is seen in episode 1 where the house is full of antiques in which a traditional nursery rhyme is read). When this breaking-in of 'Time' occurs, Investigators will be sent to assess the situation and then, if intervention is warranted, Operators are assigned to deal with the problem by a mysterious unseen authority, to be assisted by Specialists if necessary.\n\nEach adventure usually starts with Sapphire and Steel simply showing up, seemingly out of nowhere, although sometimes they are already present when the story begins. They will then investigate and mingle with various humans, although it is nearly always the location the humans are in which is of the most interest: an old house which dates back to the 18th century, an abandoned [[railway station]], a modern-day motorway petrol station, and so on. The stories are generally quite cryptic, raising more questions than answers, and have an eerie air to them, being as much [[Ghost story|ghost stories]] as they are science fiction.  The ambiguous nature of the programme extends to its main characters. While Sapphire is portrayed as more affable and \"human\" than the no-nonsense, grim Steel, it is clear that their prime concern is to deal with the break in Time, sometimes over the safety of the humans caught in the incidents they investigate. The general tone of the series is however forward-looking; that old things are dangerous, and that the past should be left behind or an evil force will be able to enter though those old things. In this situation, progress and newness are portrayed as the protecting force against 'Time'.\n\n===Characters===\nIt is heavily implied that Sapphire and Steel are not human, given their abilities and manner. Steel, for example, often has gaps in his knowledge of human culture and even Sapphire's grace is tempered with a cool detachment from the humans they interact with. In Adventure 5, Steel confirms that they were alien, \"in the [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] sense.\" The two also refer to being involved in the mystery of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]'', and in one case state they will be waiting for a ship to surface in seventy-five years. This could mean they are either exceptionally long-lived or some kind of [[time travel]] is involved. P. J. Hammond confirmed the former hypothesis in a 1993 interview.<ref name=\"Hammond interview\">{{cite web\n | year =1993\n | url =http://www.cix.co.uk/~nirvana/TVFilms/SappNSteel/hammond.html\n | title =P. J. Hammond interview\n | author = Rob Stanley\n | accessdate =2006-09-12\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060502054558/http://www.cix.co.uk/~nirvana/TVFilms/SappNSteel/hammond.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nSapphire and Steel, who are Operators, are occasionally assisted by other beings, including Lead and Silver. Silver is stated in Adventure 6 as being a Specialist rather than an Operator. There are 127 operatives in total, including 12 [[Transuranium element|transuranic elements]], which cannot be assigned where life exists. Although they are described as [[chemical element|elements]], many of the code names are non-elements, such as [[Sapphire]], [[Steel]], and [[Jet (lignite)|Jet]], although these could be pseudonyms for aesthetics or discretion. Sapphire also has a flirtatious relationship with Silver, contributing to an air of underlying sexual tension on the occasions that Silver is called upon to assist the duo. The relationship between Steel and Sapphire similarly exhibits occasional tension, as evidenced in Adventure 2 when Steel admits feeling love for Sapphire and, at one point, even kissing her on the cheek. In Adventure 1, Lead mentioned that Jet sent Steel her love and that Silver was having relationship troubles with Copper \"again\".\n\nAmong Sapphire's abilities is the power to manipulate time in small ways as well as determine the age or historical details of an object by touching it ([[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]]). This latter ability is referred in Adventure 2 as \"spot analysis\". Her most prominent ability is to \"take back time,\" literally rewinding it in a localised area to see or replay the past. She states in Adventure 1 that she cannot take time back twenty-four hours; in the last episode of the same adventure, at Steel's request she takes time back \"half a day\". In Adventure 2, she is able to \"hold time for a day\", when another (in this case, the creature seen as the darkness) takes time back over multiple days. Whether this is an improvement in abilities or a different skill entirely is not made clear. She also exhibits an ability to obtain information about people \u2013 their ages and backgrounds as well as psychological insights into their personality \u2013 just by being close to them. Sometimes it appears that she does not discover this information herself but is receiving the information [[telepathy|telepathically]] from some external source. In Adventure 2, it is stated that the age at which a living person will die is not estimated but recorded, that it is a historical fact. Nothing else is revealed in the television series as to the extent or nature of any such records, or to what extent Sapphire uses them in relation to information obtained directly. She can also manipulate people's emotions, and project illusions. When she uses her powers, her irises will usually glow blue or, under some circumstances, turquoise.\n\nSteel, on the other hand, can freeze himself to [[absolute zero]] which gives him the ability to destroy '[[ghost]]s', which are in actuality remnants of Time. He apparently possesses immense strength (in Adventure 3 he ties knots in [[elevator|lift]] cables to prevent the lift from being used) and a degree of invulnerability. He also exhibits [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] abilities, being able to paralyse people with a look, weld metal with his bare hands or undo deadbolts with a gesture.\n\nBoth Sapphire and Steel (as well as all Operatives) also appear to be able to teleport a great distance.\n\nThe operatives can also communicate telepathically with each other, and in Adventure 5, Sapphire grants this ability to a human being, whom she dubs \"Brass\" for the duration. Sapphire removes this ability at the end of the story. It is also suggested in Adventure 5 that other powers can be granted. It is hinted, in the debate that ensues between Sapphire and Steel after Sapphire gives Brass his abilities, that different powers are classed at different levels, with telepathy being considered one of the most basic.\n\nIt is not made clear in the series as to what boundaries exist on the skills of operatives. In Adventure 2, Steel cannot perform \"spot analysis\", as it is not his field, but in Adventure 4, Sapphire and Steel together are specifically able to replicate Silver's ability to transmutate by remembering what he did.\n\nOther operatives that appear also have special powers. Silver (played by [[David Collings]]), a Specialist who is designated as a Technician, is good with electronics and gadgets, is able to transform one small object into another, and is even able to replicate small objects out of nothing. He can also create long-lasting visual images of objects too large to replicate, although the exact parameters for such images are never revealed. Lead (played by Val Pringle), on the other hand, possesses superhuman strength and can act as needed insulation for Steel when he freezes himself to extreme temperatures.\n\n==Production and transmission==\nThe programme ran for over a period of four years, with six serials consisting of a total of 34 episodes were made, each episode lasting approximately 25 minutes and generally including a reprised [[wikt:pr\u00e9cis|pr\u00e9cis]] of the preceding episode. The first and second stories were shown in the summer of 1979, the second story's transmission interrupted by industrial action at the ITV network which led to a repeat of the story in 1979. The third and fourth stories were transmitted in January 1981, and the fifth in August 1981 with a sixth story \"in the can\" for future transmission. The audience figures were unusually high for a science fiction series with the first episode, gaining 11.8 million viewers and finishing as the fourth most watched programme of the week across all channels. This continued with a further seven episodes of the first year appearing in the top 20. Three more episodes in 1981 and one in 1982 also entered the top 20 ratings.<ref name=\"Ratings\">''Television's Greatest Hits'', Network Books, [[Paul Gambaccini]] and [[Rod Taylor]], 1993. {{ISBN|0 563 36247 2}}</ref>\n\nBy this time, production costs were increasing. The programme had been allocated a minuscule production budget, which led to the use of simple staging and minimal [[special effect]]s, ultimately contributing to the uneasy atmosphere of the show. The high profile and limited availability of the principal actors, Lumley and McCallum, meant that shooting was somewhat sporadic, and the programme's producers ATV were in the process of being reorganised into the new [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]]; all factors which led to the series' demise.  Central felt that viewers might mistake the new programmes for repeats of old ones, and broadcast the final, four-part story in late August 1982 to very little fanfare. Despite this, the first episode gained a high rating and finished in the top 20 most-watched programmes of the week.<ref name=\"Ratings\" /> The show has never been repeated on UK terrestrial television, but some episodes were shown on the satellite and cable station [[Bravo (UK TV network)|Bravo]] in the mid-1990s. The programme has also been made available for free online by ShoutFactoryTV.com.\n\n==Television stories==\n\n: ''For more information see [[List of Sapphire & Steel serials]]''\nNone of the stories had on-screen titles, or any official titles assigned by the writers. The Region 1 Complete Series DVD release gives the titles \"Escape Through a Crack in Time\", \"The Railway Station\", \"The Creature's Revenge\", \"The Man Without a Face\", \"Dr. McDee Must Die\" and \"The Trap\", respectively. These titles have often been cited as having been created by science fiction magazine ''Time Screen''<ref>{{cite web |title=Fire-Breathing Dimetrodon Time: Sapphire & Steel 3.5 and 3.6 |url=https://firebreathingdimetrodon.wordpress.com/2019/02/08/sapphire-steel-3-5-and-3-6/}}</ref>. Further reading reveals that in the booklet for the series, written by Tim Worthington, and included with the most recent DVD box set, on page 7 there is this quote regarding titles from creator P.J. Hammond \"I never gave titles to the stories. Neither did the production department. I think certain fanbases may have made up their own titles in order to discuss and analyse various stories.\" The various British home video releases title the stories as \"Adventure\" or \"Assignment\" I through VI.\n\nThe booklet also says, on the same page, \"some sources have claimed that these were taken from the original scripts, whereas others dismiss them as an invention on the part of a science fiction fanzine, although the editor of the fanzine in question denies that they were ever used within its pages\" and furthermore that \"the show's distributors have never knowingly used them.\"\n\nThe final television story ends on a [[cliffhanger]]. Apparently resentful of Sapphire and Steel's independence, a higher authority sends entities known as Transient Beings (similar to the operatives but until now trapped in the past), set a trap for them in a motorway caf\u00e9. The serial concludes with Silver dispatched to an unknown fate &ndash; and Sapphire and Steel being trapped in the caf\u00e9, floating through space, apparently for eternity. The cliffhanger has never been resolved, although Hammond has stated that vague plans existed for further adventures. This was also stated by Joanna Lumley in her autobiography,<ref>Stare Back and Smile ''by [[Joanna Lumley]], page 157, [[Viking Penguin]] books,'' 1989. {{ISBN|0-670-82174-8}}</ref> who remembered that they were told that this was merely an end-of-season cliffhanger, and that Sapphire and Steel would be freed at the start of the next series. However, in an interview with ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (#329, cover date: 30 April 2003), David Collings recalled that although another series was planned, Joanna Lumley and David McCallum both decided that they'd had enough and didn't wish to do any more.\n\n==Merchandise==\n[[Image:SapphireAndSteelBook.jpg|right|thumb|150px|''Sapphire & Steel'' [[novelization|novelisation]] of the first adventure]]\nOne novelisation of the series was released. The first story of the series was released by Star Books in 1979 and was written by Peter J. Hammond.\n\nA two-page coloured ''Sapphire & Steel'' picture strip, written by [[Angus Allan]] and drawn by [[Arthur Ranson]], appeared in the ''[[Look-In]]'' magazine. It ran for a total of 76 issues from 1979-1981 &ndash; with a break of 13 issues between runs &ndash; and formed 14 untitled stories. It would appear that Ranson used photographs of Joanna Lumley and David McCallum from the first television adventure for reference, as Sapphire and Steel are almost always depicted wearing the outfits from this story. In the third story, Lead makes a cameo appearance and displays a further power: turning British soldiers from the Napoleonic War into miniature (and presumably lead) toy soldiers. However, the picture strip version of Lead &ndash; though depicted as a powerfully built black man &ndash; was not based upon Val Pringle who played the part on television; it can only be assumed that Ranson had very little in the way of photographic reference material in this case. In addition, a one-off ''Sapphire & Steel'' text story titled ''The Albatross'' was published in the 1981 ''Look-In Annual''. This was illustrated in black and white by Arthur Ranson.\n\nThe first and only ''Sapphire & Steel'' Annual was published in late 1980 by World International Publishing Ltd. at \u00a31.95, and featured a number of text stories and features. The front cover used the same photograph as that on P.J. Hammond's 1979 Star Books novelisation of Adventure One.\n\nP.J. Hammond did not write the stories for ''Sapphire & Steel Annual 1981'', but he was sent proofs to read in advance of publication. His only reservations with the stories were that Sapphire and Steel were able to move back in time, which he felt tended to contradict the premise set in the television series that Time was only allowed to break into the present day. However, this did not worry Hammond too much as, like ''Look-In'', the Annual was aimed at younger readers.<ref name=\"Hammond interview\">{{cite web\n | year =1993\n | url =http://www.cix.co.uk/~nirvana/TVFilms/SappNSteel/hammond.html\n | title =P.

Stories were labelled \"Adventure\" in the first releases (in lieu of story titles) and \"Assignment\" for the second release.\n\nIn 2002, the series was released for the first time on DVD, in the UK. Originally, it was released as two box-sets, with the first three stories on one (20 episodes) and the final three on the other (14 episodes). Also in the UK, Network Distributing Ltd Home Entertainment released the complete series on DVD on 5 November 2007. The 6-disc set features a new documentary and commentaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.networkdvd.net/product_info.php?products_id=500|title=Sapphire and Steel: The Complete Series Special Edition: Network DVD<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Networkdvd.net|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref>  On 26 May 2008, the complete series boxset was re-released with new packaging.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sapphire-Steel-Complete-Repackaged-DVD/dp/B001BHTN6S|title=Sapphire and Steel: The Complete Series|date=26 May 2008|website=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=20 March 2017|via=Amazon}}</ref> In the US, [[A&E Television Networks|A&E Home Entertainment]], under license from [[ITV Studios Global Entertainment|Carlton International Media Limited]], released the entire series on Region 1 DVD on 28 December 2004 and [[Shout!

However, neither McCallum nor Lumley reprised their roles: McCallum was working in the [[United States]] and Lumley declined to play Sapphire again. The characters were recast, with [[Susannah Harker]] and [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] taking over the roles. The range is produced by [[Nigel Fairs]] and [[Jason Haigh-Ellery]].\n\nThe character of Gold (played by [[Mark Gatiss]]) appears in the first adventure ''[[The Passenger (Sapphire & Steel)|The Passenger]]'' and returns in ''[[Perfect Day (Sapphire & Steel)|Perfect Day]]'' and ''[[Zero (Sapphire and Steel)|Zero]]''. He is portrayed as impatient and inexperienced when dealing with both humans and the various manifestations of Time, even more detached and clinical in many ways than Steel, almost as if he is still in training. The character of Ruby (played by [[Lisa Bowerman]]) appears in the second series story ''[[Water Like a Stone]]'', reappearing in ''[[Cruel Immortality]]'' and ''[[Second Sight (Sapphire and Steel)|Second Sight]]''. Her character has an understanding and affinity to Time within the rhythms of music, and also comes across as rather dry and sardonic, especially when interacting with Steel. David Collings reprises his role as Silver in the third and fifth stories of the first series of audio plays and then again in the third story of the third series. During the production of each season, Nigel Fairs has had to step in at late notice to write a replacement script (writing ''[[Dead Man Walking (Sapphire & Steel)|Dead Man Walking]]'' from John Ainsworth's outline in series one, replacing [[Gary Russell]]'s ''Big Fun'' with ''Cruel Immortality'' in series two and replacing [[Joseph Lidster]]'s ''Reborn'' with ''Second Sight'' in series three).\n\nIt was originally said by Big Finish that the new stories would be set before the climactic final story of the television series, but the released plays are actually set after assignment 6, and at the start of ''The Passenger'', the characters comment that it has been a long time since they last worked together and, in ''[[Cruel Immortality]]'', imply that they were freed in some unspecified way by Silver.\n\nAt the end of ''[[The Mystery of the Missing Hour]]'', Sapphire and Steel once again find themselves trapped. The following story, ''[[Second Sight (Sapphire and Steel)|Second Sight]]'' sees the characters 'reborn' once more - this time in the guise of two young Australians, played by [[Blair McDonough]] and [[Anna Skellern]]. At the end of ''Second Sight'', however, Ruby was able to release the previous incarnations of Sapphire and Steel from their trap - with David Warner and Susannah Harker reprising their roles for the rest of the series.\n\nThe audio dramas featured some notable guest stars - including [[Hugo Myatt]], [[Muriel Pavlow]], [[Daphne Oxenford]], [[Lucy Gaskell]], [[Colin Baker]], [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]], [[Sam Kelly]], [[David Horovitch]], [[Mark Gatiss]] and [[Louise Jameson]].\n\n==Planned remakes==\n\nThe idea of a remake of ''Sapphire & Steel'' was floated a few times, but the plans never came to fruition. Original series creator Peter J. Hammond said that he had discussions with ITV about a remake in 2006,<ref>{{cite web |title=Steeling the show: Q&A Peter J. Hammond |url=https://guyhaley.wordpress.com/interviews-2/pj-hammond-2007/|date=2013-04-08}}</ref> but no developments followed. According to reports, \"the backlash to [[The Prisoner (2009 miniseries)|the US remake of ''The Prisoner'']] [...] put an end to the idea\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Intriguingly Ambiguous: Can Sapphire & Steel Return? |url=https://www.headstuff.org/entertainment/film/intriguingly-ambiguous-can-sapphire-steel-return/|date=2015-07-11}}</ref> In July 2015, ''Luther'' creator Neil Cross announced to ''Variety'' that he was working on a new series of ''Sapphire & Steel''.<ref>{{cite web |title='Luther' Creator Neil Cross to Revive 1970s Sci-fi Series 'Sapphire & Steel' |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/global/luther-creator-neil-cross-to-revive-1970s-sci-fi-series-sapphire-steel-1201536780/|date=2015-07-09}}</ref> The following year, ITV Studios-owned independent Big Talk Productions confirmed that it was remaking ''Sapphire & Steel'', with Cross attached to the project,<ref>{{cite web |title=US studios extend int'l footprint |url=http://dramaquarterly.com/tag/big-talk-productions/}}</ref> and writer Ed Hime indicating that he was part of the team.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ed Hime, CV |url=https://www.unitedagents.co.uk/ed-hime |accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref> However, in a December 2017 interview with ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', Cross said that the project had been cancelled, mainly due to the limited popularity of the original show.<ref>{{cite web |title=Neil Cross Discusses 'Hard Sun', 'Luther' Movie, 'Escape From New York' Remake |url=https://deadline.com/2017/12/neil-cross-hard-sun-luther-movie-escape-from-new-york-remake-1202214942/|date=2017-12-04}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bigfinish.com/Sapphire-and-Steel Big Finish Productions - ''Sapphire & Steel'']\n* [https://obversebooks.co.uk/silverarchive/products-category/silver-2018/ Obverse Books Guides to ''Sapphire & Steel'']\n* [http://www.anorakzone.com/sapphireandsteel/ The Anorak's Guide to Sapphire & Steel]\n* {{Screenonline TV title|976445}}\n* {{IMDb title|0078682}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sapphire and Steel}}\n[[Category:1979 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1982 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1970s British science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:British science fiction television programmes]]\n[[Category:British supernatural television programmes]]\n[[Category:ITV television dramas]]\n[[Category:British time travel television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by ITV Studios]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television programmes produced by Associated Television (ATV)]]\n[[Category:Television programmes produced by Central Independent Television]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire_%26_Steel"}

Approximately 40 percents of sunny hours are observed in summer. The climate in Shaki is influenced by various air masses, cyclones and anticyclones, and local winds. Arctic and mild air masses enter Shaki with causing the temperature rise in the winter. Mountain winds form local winds in Sheki in the summer. It is because of a contrast in pressure between the mountain and the valley. The cold winds are moderated by the Great Caucasus from the north. Thus, the temperature in Sheki is 0.5 C in January. The average annual temperature is 12 C in Sheki. The average temperature ranges from 20 to 25 C in June and August.\n\nIn Sheki solid winds (over 15m / s) are hardly ever seen, with as 10\u201312 days a solid wind. Less than 1 meter per second the speed of the wind in Sheki is often observed. The average sum of rainfall is 730&nbsp;mm. 50% of it falls in May, June, September and October. In Kish village the least precipitation is in August (35&nbsp;mm), January (29&nbsp;mm) and February (36&nbsp;mm), 775&nbsp;mm, over 1000&nbsp;mm rainfall in Khan Lowland. Floods, storm, and hail are characteristic for the mountain and the fields encompassing Sheki and its urban places.\n\nThe flood event is observed frequently. The Kish Waterway basin is located in the western portion of the city and it is considered one of the most powerful flood areas in the world. In the place called Guruchay were collected sand, stone, and mud from the mountains for a long time and its middle part is higher than the city Dodo settlement. The atmosphere events such as the storm and the hail have a great deal of effect here. High relief, strong heat in the summer and high evaporation are the essential reasons of hail in Shaki.\n\nThe elevation of 500\u2013850 m above sea level, the mountain woodlands encompassing it prevents the city from overheating. The city is secured from floods by mountain woodlands. It makes the view of the city even more beautiful. The mountainous grassland, brown mountain woodlands, meadow-forest, gray brown soils cover the city. Oak, peanuts, hornbeam trees are spacious in the woodlands. The animal world is rich.\n\nThe main streams of the city are Kish and Gurcana rivers. Kish is the right arm of Eyrichay, it is 33&nbsp;km long, and the basin area is 265 km<sup>2</sup>. It starts at 2900 meters above the southern slope of the main Caucasian Range. It is one of the most flooded rivers of Transcaucasia. The upper axis is called Damarchin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://anl.az/down/meqale/movqe/2011/iyul/189502.htm|title=Sheki district|website=The National Library of Azerbaijan}}</ref>\n\n== Notable persons ==\n[[Mirza Fatali Akhundov]] - writer, public figure\n\n[[Bakhtiyar Vahabzadeh]] - poet\n\n[[Molla C\u00fcm\u0259]] - poet\n\n[[Ahmadiyya Jabrayilov]] - World War II participant, partisan\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Iki arvadli]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Shaki Rayon}}\n*{{official website|http://sheki-ih.gov.az}}\n\n{{Shaki Rayon}}\n\n{{coord|41|06|N|47|00|E|region:AZ_source:kolossus-simplewiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Districts of Azerbaijan]]\n[[Category:Shaki District| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Shekay District}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n{{short description|District of Azerbaijan}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name = Shaki<br>\u015e\u0259ki\n| type = [[Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan|Rayon]]\n| image_skyline = Looking North from Sheki (3846239867).jpg\n| image_caption =Looking north from the Sheki Rayon\n| image_map = Azerbaijan-Shaki rayonu.png\n| map_caption = Map of Azerbaijan showing Shaki Rayon (in red)\n| subdivision_type = Country\n| subdivision_name = [[Azerbaijan]]\n| established_date = 8 August 1930\n| established_title = Established\n| population_as_of = 2018\n| population_total = 184,500\n| population_footnotes=<ref name=\"stats15\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.az/source/demoqraphy/en/001_19-20en.xls|title= Population by sex, economic and administrative regions, urban settlements of the Republic of Azerbaijan at the beginning of the 2015 |publisher= The State Statistical Committee of the Azerbaijan Republic|accessdate=9 August 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150820103456/http://www.stat.gov.az/source/demoqraphy/en/001_19-20en.xls | archive-date = 20 August 2015}}</ref>\n| area_total_km2 =2,430\n| population_density_km2 = 76\n| area_code_type = Telephone code\n| area_code = 0117\n| postal_code_type = Postal code\n| postal_code = 5500\n| seat_type = Capital\n| seat = [[Sheki, Azerbaijan|Sheki]]\n| language=Azerbaijan , Lezgi\n| leader_title            = Chief Executive\n| leader_name             =Elxan Zabir o\u011flu Usubov \n| leader_party= [[New Azerbaijan Party]]\n| website = {{url|http://sheki-ih.gov.az}}\n}}\n\n'''Shaki''' or '''\u015eeki''' ({{lang-az|\u015e\u0259ki rayonu}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan|rayon]] of [[Azerbaijan]].

Approximately 40 percents of sunny hours are observed in summer. The climate in Shaki is influenced by various air masses, cyclones and anticyclones, and local winds. Arctic and mild air masses enter Shaki with causing the temperature rise in the winter. Mountain winds form local winds in Sheki in the summer. It is because of a contrast in pressure between the mountain and the valley. The cold winds are moderated by the Great Caucasus from the north. Thus, the temperature in Sheki is 0.5 C in January. The average annual temperature is 12 C in Sheki. The average temperature ranges from 20 to 25 C in June and August.\n\nIn Sheki solid winds (over 15m / s) are hardly ever seen, with as 10\u201312 days a solid wind. Less than 1 meter per second the speed of the wind in Sheki is often observed. The average sum of rainfall is 730&nbsp;mm. 50% of it falls in May, June, September and October. In Kish village the least precipitation is in August (35&nbsp;mm), January (29&nbsp;mm) and February (36&nbsp;mm), 775&nbsp;mm, over 1000&nbsp;mm rainfall in Khan Lowland. Floods, storm, and hail are characteristic for the mountain and the fields encompassing Sheki and its urban places.\n\nThe flood event is observed frequently. The Kish Waterway basin is located in the western portion of the city and it is considered one of the most powerful flood areas in the world. In the place called Guruchay were collected sand, stone, and mud from the mountains for a long time and its middle part is higher than the city Dodo settlement. The atmosphere events such as the storm and the hail have a great deal of effect here. High relief, strong heat in the summer and high evaporation are the essential reasons of hail in Shaki.\n\nThe elevation of 500\u2013850 m above sea level, the mountain woodlands encompassing it prevents the city from overheating. The city is secured from floods by mountain woodlands. It makes the view of the city even more beautiful. The mountainous grassland, brown mountain woodlands, meadow-forest, gray brown soils cover the city. Oak, peanuts, hornbeam trees are spacious in the woodlands. The animal world is rich.\n\nThe main streams of the city are Kish and Gurcana rivers. Kish is the right arm of Eyrichay, it is 33&nbsp;km long, and the basin area is 265 km<sup>2</sup>. It starts at 2900 meters above the southern slope of the main Caucasian Range. It is one of the most flooded rivers of Transcaucasia. The upper axis is called Damarchin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://anl.az/down/meqale/movqe/2011/iyul/189502.htm|title=Sheki district|website=The National Library of Azerbaijan}}</ref>\n\n== Notable persons ==\n[[Mirza Fatali Akhundov]] - writer, public figure\n\n[[Bakhtiyar Vahabzadeh]] - poet\n\n[[Molla C\u00fcm\u0259]] - poet\n\n[[Ahmadiyya Jabrayilov]] - World War II participant, partisan\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Iki arvadli]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Shaki Rayon}}\n*{{official website|http://sheki-ih.gov.az}}\n\n{{Shaki Rayon}}\n\n{{coord|41|06|N|47|00|E|region:AZ_source:kolossus-simplewiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Districts of Azerbaijan]]\n[[Category:Shaki District| ]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaki_District"}

In the mid-1980s, Putnam played bass in the [[thrash metal]] band [[Executioner (band)|Executioner]].\n\n===Personality===\nDespite his shock humor and turbulent lifestyle, Putnam was often described by fans and peers as a warm, intelligent, sensitive man. Putnam saw himself as a [[comedian]] and used music as an outlet.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2011/06/28/seth-putnam-remembered/ |title=Seth Putnam Remembered |date=June 28, 2011 |first=Shawn |last=Macomber |magazine=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]] |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn school, classmates who knew Putnam described him as intelligent and stern, but unmotivated, apathetic and often an underwhelming student. Putnam skipped a grade in school and became a very bright student, tutoring his classmates. In his own words, Putnam often blamed brutal fights with Catholic school nuns for helping to shape his cynical personality. When he reached high school after eighth grade, he had lost interest in excelling in education or academics, becoming more of a slacker and underachiever.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/467/20831/Seth-Putnam-from-Anal-Cunt-discusses-growing-up.html |title=Seth Putnam from Anal Cunt discusses growing up |date=January 5, 2011 |first=Jason |last=Fisher |website=The Gauntlet |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> By the time he had graduated school, Putnam had left the Catholic religion in which he was raised.

The first recording was in January ,1999, of Larry hammering a fence against some lady's garage which was put on at the end of the song, \"M.P.\" on the first release. That summer, they recorded four songs. all of them were old Sickness songs. \"Blinking Blue Lights\" was actually recorded by Kilslug, but never released. The other songs that were done originally by the Sickness never got released either. They made another E.P. called \"Bad Mood\" that had a certain amount of copies pressed but were never officially released. Seth and Lee Suniga (owner of Menace To Sobriety Records) sold them on eBay. Angry Hate performed two live shows in March and April 2002.\n\n====Satan's Warriors====\nSatan's Warriors started in February of 1986 after Seth and his friends made up a fake death metal fanzine with fake band names as a joke, Seth eventually admitted to doing it, in April of that year. There was an opening for a band to play live over the radio so Seth got a lineup together and made a four-song demo with him on drums and vocals and his cousin Drew on guitar. Their final show was on July of 1988. They were supposed to get back together in 2003 and re-record some songs written between 1986 and 1988. The lineup was supposed to be with Seth on guitar & vocals, Paulie Kraynak on second guitar, and John Gillis on drums.\n\n====Impaled Northern Moonforest====\nIn early 1997, Seth and Josh Martin came up with the idea of starting a joke black metal band and decided to record a demo, they didn't use actual drums because someone was sleeping in the room next to them so Josh played his acoustic guitar while Seth did vocals and percussion by slapping his leg and a mattress, they did a few shows and sold copies of their first demo, the titles on the demo are different from the ones on the 7\" vinyl release due to Seth and Josh losing their copies of the demo and forgetting the titles.\n\n====Shit Scum====\nShit Scum formed in 1988 after Seth saw an ad looking for musicians, Seth chose to call after seeing Cryptic Slaughter as the only influence because not many people in Boston were into that band. Seth eventually invited Fred Ordonez to see Satan's Warriors (which was their last show), Anal Cunt was also playing what was supposed to be their last show but Fred and his friends never showed up, so Seth did another show with Anal Cunt so Fred could see them, Shit Scum also did their first show on the same day. Seth was eventually invited to a studio to play bass on their first demo called \"Self Mutilation\", they later did a show in 1990, Seth and Fred (without Wayne who was their drummer) went to a studio that college rock bands mainly performed at. The engineer didn't like them and tried convincing them to quit, the record was eventually finished and they ended up owing the studio money so the studio kept the master reel. Anal Cunt did a tour in Germany and did some Shit Scum covers. Matthias Weigand (head of Ecocentric Records) liked the cover of the song \"Shit Scum\" and wanted to put out a 7\". Seth called the studio and asked about the reel, the guy on the phone said \"it's right here, pick it up whenever you want\", not knowing they owed money to the studio. Seth mixed all the songs and sent them to Ecocentric Records. Fred never had a cover for the record so Matthias made one up. The record was eventually called \"Manson Is Jesus\". Fred wanted the record to be called, \"I Wish this Record Could Punch You in the Face\", and have a fist on the cover. Shit Scum had already broken up by the time the album was released.\n\n====Full Blown A.I.D.S.====\nFull Blown A.I.D.S. started in 1997 while he was jamming with his friend and cousin.

He was known for his high-pitched screamed vocals and lyrics that either shock, offend, or invoke [[black comedy|morbid humor]]. Throughout his career, Putnam was also involved in numerous side projects.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nPutnam was born on May 15, 1968, in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/71292842 |title=Seth Edward Putnam |website=[[Find a Grave]] |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> to father Edward R. Putnam and mother Barbara Ann Donohue. His parents are divorced. Seth was married to his first wife, Alison, from December 1998 through June 2001. He married Julie, his second wife, in 2008. In the mid-1980s, Putnam played bass in the [[thrash metal]] band [[Executioner (band)|Executioner]].\n\n===Personality===\nDespite his shock humor and turbulent lifestyle, Putnam was often described by fans and peers as a warm, intelligent, sensitive man. Putnam saw himself as a [[comedian]] and used music as an outlet.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2011/06/28/seth-putnam-remembered/ |title=Seth Putnam Remembered |date=June 28, 2011 |first=Shawn |last=Macomber |magazine=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]] |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn school, classmates who knew Putnam described him as intelligent and stern, but unmotivated, apathetic and often an underwhelming student. Putnam skipped a grade in school and became a very bright student, tutoring his classmates. In his own words, Putnam often blamed brutal fights with Catholic school nuns for helping to shape his cynical personality. When he reached high school after eighth grade, he had lost interest in excelling in education or academics, becoming more of a slacker and underachiever.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/467/20831/Seth-Putnam-from-Anal-Cunt-discusses-growing-up.html |title=Seth Putnam from Anal Cunt discusses growing up |date=January 5, 2011 |first=Jason |last=Fisher |website=The Gauntlet |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> By the time he had graduated school, Putnam had left the Catholic religion in which he was raised.

Chang also recounted an incident \nafter a show when Putnam introduced his mother to Chang, he remarked that they had met earlier when he pulled Putnam's mother out from the show's [[moshpit]], causing Putnam to become aggressive and threaten Chang, much to the confusion of everyone present.<ref name=\"sttg\"/> \nPutnam was also good friends with [[Pantera]] frontman, [[Phil Anselmo|Philip Anselmo]].\n\n===Drug overdose and coma===\nOn October 12, 2004 Putnam was hospitalized after ingesting a cocktail of [[crack-cocaine]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[heroin]], and two months' worth of [[Ambien]] sleeping pills.<ref name=\"coma\">{{cite news |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/cellars/documents/05023497.asp |title=Coma chameleon - Seth Putnam's near-death experience |first=Carly |last=Carioli |newspaper=[[Boston Phoenix]] |date=October 12, 2004 |accessdate=August 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217193005/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/cellars/documents/05023497.asp |archivedate=December 17, 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It has been reported that he spent the previous day contemplating suicide,<ref name=\"coma\" /> though exact circumstances surrounding the drug overdose are vague.\n\nAnal Cunt's 1997 album ''I Like It When You Die'' contained the track \"You're in a Coma\".

Mickey Offender from D.R.I., Offenders,  was supposed to lay a bass track but it never happened.(rip)\n\n====Sirhan Sirhan====\nThis band started in December of 1990 and Seth and Tim Morse were trying to think of a christmas gift for Mike Mahan who recently moved to Indiana, they recorded a demo and got a band picture in a $2 photo booth. They sent it to Mike who eventually lost his copy, the demo was released as a split album with Cuntsaw.\n\n====Insult====\nInsult started in 1992 and decided to record an album in 1997, it was going horribly for them so they got Seth to come in and produce their album, the album was called \"I Wanna Be A Burn Victim\", Seth eventually became their bass player and did a west coast tour with them in 1998 as well as a live show over the radio which was released on a split with Anal Cunt, he quit in 1999.\n\n====Person Killer====\nPerson Killer was a one man project Seth started around 1995, he made a demo and sent it to Earache Records along with a t-shirt, a pin, and a letter that didn't reveal the sender's name. It was planned to be released on a two LP set called \"The Worst Of Seth Putnam\" but it hasn't been released.\n\n===Vaginal Jesus===\nRumors circulated as to whether or not Putnam was a member of Vaginal Jesus, originally stating that he was just \"friends\" with the band. However, he later retracted this claim and publicly admitted to being a member.<ref>Resistance magazine // issue no. 25, Winter 2005/2006</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623033415/http://www.racrecords.com/shop/magazines/resistance-magazine-issue-25-spring-2007/|title=Resistance Magazine Issue #25 Winter 2005 / 2006 \u2013 R.A.C.

SSIDs serve as \"network names\" and are typically [[natural language]] labels. A service set forms a logical network -- that is operating with the same level 2 networking parameters -- they are on the same [[Logical link control|logical network segment]] (e.g., IP subnet or VLAN).\n\n'''Basic service sets''' ('''BSS''') are a subgroup of devices within a service set which are additionally also operating with the same physical layer [[medium access control|medium access]] characteristics (i.e. radio frequency, modulation scheme, security settings etc.) such that they are wirelessly networked. Devices within basic service sets are identified by '''BSSIDs''' ('''basic service set identifiers'''), which are 48-bit labels that conform to [[MAC-48]] conventions. While devices may have multiple BSSIDs, usually each BSSID is associated with at most one basic service set at a time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos-space-apps/network-director2.0/topics/concept/wireless-ssid-bssid-essid.html#jd0e46|title=Understanding the Network Terms SSID, BSSID, and ESSID - Technical Documentation - Support - Juniper Networks|website=www.juniper.net}}</ref> There are two classes of basic service sets: those that are formed by an [[infrastructure mode]] redistribution point (access points or mesh nodes), and those that are formed by independent [[Station (networking)|stations]] in a peer-to-peer [[wireless ad hoc network|ad hoc topology]] (an '''Independent Basic Service Set''' or  '''IBSS'''.)\n\nA basic service set should not to be confused with the coverage area of an access point, known as the 'basic service area' (BSA).{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 3.15, p. 5}}\n\n==Basic service sets (BSSs){{anchor|BSS|IBSS|BSSID}}==\n===Infrastructure mode===\nAn [[infrastructure mode]] wireless network basic service set (BSS) consists of one redistribution point {{mdash}} typically an [[wireless access point|access point]] (WAP or AP) {{mdash}} together with one or more \"client\" stations<!-- in the standard, an AP is also a STA, so don't abbreviate --> that are associated with (i.e. connected to) that redistribution point.{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 3.16, p. 6}} The operating parameters of the infrastructure-BSS are defined by the redistribution point.

A BSSID with a value of all 1s is used to indicate the wildcard BSSID, usable only during probe requests or for communications that take place outside the context of a BSS.{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 7.1.3.3.3, p. 65}}\n\n===Mesh basic service set===\nFrom the point of view of a wireless clients, [[IEEE 802.11s]] [[wireless mesh networks]] appear as a conventional infrastructure mode topology, and are centrally configured as such. The formation of the mesh's BSS, as well as wireless traffic management (including path selection and forwarding) is negotiated between the [[Node (networking)|nodes]] (redistribution points) of the mesh infrastructure. The mesh's BSS is distinct from the networks (which may also be wireless) used by a mesh's redistribution points to communicate with one another.\n\n===Ad hoc===\nIn contrast to the stations in an infrastructure-mode network, the stations in a [[wireless ad hoc network]] communicate directly with one another, i.e. without a dependence on a distribution point to relay traffic between them.{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 5.6, p. 41}} In this form of peer-to-peer wireless networking, the peers form an independent basic service set (IBSS).{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 5.21, p. 25}} Some of the responsibilities of a distribution point {{mdash}} such as defining network parameters and other \"beaconing\" functions {{mdash}} are established by the first station in an ad-hoc network. But that station does not relay traffic between the other stations; instead, the peers communicate directly with one another. Like infrastructure-BSSs, independent-BSSs also have a 48-bit MAC address-like identifier. But unlike infrastructure-BSS identifiers, independent-BSSs identifiers are not necessarily unique: the individual/group bit of the address is always set to 0 (individual), the universal/local bit of the address is always set to 1 (local), and the remaining 46 bits are randomly generated.{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 7.1.3.3.3, p. 65}}\n\n==Service set ID (WiFi){{anchor|SSID}}==\nThe SSID is broadcast by stations in beacon packets to announce the presence of a network.\n\nUnlike basic service set identifiers, SSIDs are usually customizable.{{sfn|Vasseur|Dunkels|2010|page=432}} These SSIDs can be zero to 32 [[octet (computing)|octet]]s (32 [[byte]]s) long,{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 7.3.2.1, p. 101}} and are, for convenience, usually in a [[natural language]], such as English.

From the perspective of the link layer, all stations within an ESS are all on the same link, and transfer from one BSS to another is transparent to logical link control.{{sfn|Edney|2004|p=8}}\n\nThe basic service sets formed in [[wireless ad hoc network]]s are, by definition, independent from other BSSs, and an independent-BSS cannot therefore be part of an extended infrastructure.{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 5.6, p. 40}} In that formal sense an independent-BSS has no extended service set. However, the network packets of both independent-BSSs and infrastructure-BSSs have a logical network service set identifier (described below), and the logical link control does not distinguish between the use of that field to name an ESS network, and the use of that field to name a peer-to-peer ad hoc network. The two are effectively indistinguishable at the logical link control layer level.{{sfn|Edney|2004|p=8}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"n\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation\n|last=Dornseif|first=Maximillian\n|last2=Schumann|first2=Kay H.\n|last3=Klein|first3=Christian\n|title=Tats\u00e4chliche und rechtliche Risiken drahtloser Computernetzwerke\n|url=http://www.l13.de/itsec/whirl/200204-dud-wlan.pdf\n|journal=Datenschutz und Datensicherheit\n|volume=22|issue=4\n|year=2002\n|pages=1{{ndash}}5\n|ref={{harvid|Dornseif, et al|2002}}\n}}.\n* {{citation\n|last=Edney\n|first=Jon\n|year=2004\n|chapter=What is an ESS?\n|title=IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee Meeting, July 2004\n|location=Piscataway, NJ\n|publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n|chapter-url=http://www.ieee802.org/21/doctree/2004_Meeting_Docs/2004-07_meeting_docs/21-04-0105-00-0000-what_ess.ppt\n}}.\n*{{citation\n|last=Lindqvist|first=Janne\n|last2=Aura|first2=Tuomas\n|last3=Danezis|first3=George\n|last4=Koponen|first4=Teemu\n|last5=Myllyniemi|first5=Annu\n|last6=M\u00e4ki|first6=Jussi\n|last7=Roe|first7=Michael\n|ref={{harvid|Lindqvist, et al|2009}}\n|chapter=Privacy-preserving 802.11 Access-point Discovery\n|pages=123{{ndash}}130\n|title=Proceedings of the Second ACM Conference on Wireless Network Security\n|series=WiSec '09\n|year=2009\n|location=New York|publisher=ACM\n|isbn=978-1-60558-460-7\n|doi=10.1145/1514274.1514293\n|citeseerx=10.1.1.206.4148\n}}.\n* {{citation\n|last=Murty|first=Rohan\n|last2=Padhye|first2=Jitendra\n|last3=Chandra|first3=Ranveer\n|last4=Wolman|first4=Alec\n|last5=Zill|first5=Brian\n|year=2008\n|chapter=Designing High Performance Enterprise Wi-Fi Networks\n|pages=73{{ndash}}88\n|chapter-url=http://static.usenix.org/event/nsdi08/tech/full_papers/murty/murty.pdf\n|title=Proceedings of the 5th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation\n|series=NSDI '08\n|editor-last=Crowcroft|editor-first=Jon\n|editor2-last=Dahlin|editor2-first=Mike\n|display-editors=etal\n|location=Berkeley, CA\n|publisher=USENIX Association\n|ref={{harvid|Murty, et al|2008}}\n}}.\n* {{citation\n|chapter-url=http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11p-2010.pdf\n|editor-last=Stacey|editor-first=Robert\n|editor2-last=Ecclesine|editor2-first=Peter\n|display-editors=etal\n|chapter={{null|Part 11: }}Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications, Amendment 6{{null|: Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments.}} (IEEE Std 802.11p-2010)\n|title=Local and Metropolitan Area Networks, Specific Requirements{{null|full title: 802.11p-2010 - IEEE Standard for Information technology--Telecommunications and information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks--Specific requirements - Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications, Amendment 6: Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments.}}\n|series=IEEE Standard for Information technology {{mdash}} Telecommunications and information exchange between systems\n|year=2010{{null|date=2010-07-15}}\n|location=Piscataway, NJ\n|publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n|isbn=978-0-7381-6324-6\n|ref={{harvid|IEEE Std 802.11p-2010}}\n}}.\n* {{citation\n|chapter-url=http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-2007.pdf{{null|full title: 802.11-2007 - IEEE Standard for Information technology--Telecommunications and information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks--Specific requirements - Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications}}\n|editor-last=Cole|editor-first=Terry L.\n|editor2-last=Barber|editor2-first=Simon\n|chapter={{null|Part 11: }}Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications (IEEE Std 802.11-2007)\n|title=Local and Metropolitan Area Networks, Specific Requirements\n|series=IEEE Standard for Information technology{{mdash}} Telecommunications and information exchange between systems.\n|year=2007|{{null|date=2007-06-12}}\n|location=Piscataway, NJ\n|publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n|isbn=978-0-7381-5656-9\n|ref={{harvid|IEEE Std 802.11-2007}}\n}}.\n* {{citation\n|title=Interconnecting Smart Objects with IP: The Next Internet\n|first=Jean-Philippe\n|last=Vasseur\n|first2=Adam\n|last2=Dunkels\n|location=Burlington, MA\n|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann\n|isbn=978-0-12-375166-9\n|year=2010\n}}.\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Wireless networking]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:SSID_ESS.svg|thumb|An example of a service set called \"WiFi Wikipedia\" consisting of two Basic Service Sets.

When a client wishes to associate with a network, it sends the SSID in a probe request. An access point replies with a probe response if the SSID in a probe request is the wildcard SSID (SSID is zero-length) or matches a SSID that the access point supports{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 11.1.3.2.1, p. 422}} otherwise the access point does not respond to the probe request.}} A null SSID (the SSID element's 'length' field is set to zero{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 7.3.2.1, p. 101}}) is called a \"wildcard SSID\" in IEEE 802.11 standards documents,{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 11.1.3.2.1, p. 422}} and as a \"no broadcast SSID\" or \"hidden SSID\" in the context of beacon announcements,{{sfn|Murty, et al|2008|p=75}}{{sfn|Dornseif, et al|2002|p=2}} and can be used, for example, in enterprise and mesh networks to steer a client to a particular (e.g. less utilized) access point.{{sfn|Murty, et al|2008|p=75}} A station may also likewise transmit packets in which the SSID field is set to null; this prompts an associated access point to send the station a list of supported SSIDs.{{sfn|Lindqvist, et al|2009|pp=123f}} Once a device has associated with a basic service set, for efficiency, the SSID is not sent within packet headers; only BSSIDs are used for addressing.\n\n==Extended service sets (ESSs){{anchor|ESS|ESSID}}==\nFormally, there is no distinct ''ESSID'' in the 802.11 standards.{{sfn|Edney|2004|p=11}}{{sup|cf.{{nbsp}}}}{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=Definitions, \u00a7 3, p. 8}} In 802.11 standard documents, the logical network (ESS or independent-BSS) service set identifier is simply abbreviated ''SSID'',{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 7.3.2.1, p. 101}} irrespective of whether an SSID identifies an infrastructure-BSS's ESS, or the peer-to-peer network of an independent-BSS.\n\nAn extended service set (ESS) is a set of one or more infrastructure basic service sets on a common [[logical link control|logical network segment]] (i.e. same IP subnet and VLAN).{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 3.54, p. 8}} Key to the concept is that the participating basic service sets appear as a single network to the [[logical link control]] layer.{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 3.54, p. 8}}{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 5.2.3.1, p. 26}} Thus, from the perspective of the logical link control layer, stations within an ESS may communicate with one another, and mobile stations may move transparently from one participating BSS to another (within the same ESS).{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 5.2.3.1, p. 26}} Extended service sets make possible distribution services such as centralized authentication and seamless roaming between infrastructure-BSSs. From the perspective of the link layer, all stations within an ESS are all on the same link, and transfer from one BSS to another is transparent to logical link control.{{sfn|Edney|2004|p=8}}\n\nThe basic service sets formed in [[wireless ad hoc network]]s are, by definition, independent from other BSSs, and an independent-BSS cannot therefore be part of an extended infrastructure.{{sfn|IEEE Std 802.11-2007|loc=\u00a7 5.6, p. 40}} In that formal sense an independent-BSS has no extended service set. However, the network packets of both independent-BSSs and infrastructure-BSSs have a logical network service set identifier (described below), and the logical link control does not distinguish between the use of that field to name an ESS network, and the use of that field to name a peer-to-peer ad hoc network. The two are effectively indistinguishable at the logical link control layer level.{{sfn|Edney|2004|p=8}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"n\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation\n|last=Dornseif|first=Maximillian\n|last2=Schumann|first2=Kay H.\n|last3=Klein|first3=Christian\n|title=Tats\u00e4chliche und rechtliche Risiken drahtloser Computernetzwerke\n|url=http://www.l13.de/itsec/whirl/200204-dud-wlan.pdf\n|journal=Datenschutz und Datensicherheit\n|volume=22|issue=4\n|year=2002\n|pages=1{{ndash}}5\n|ref={{harvid|Dornseif, et al|2002}}\n}}.\n* {{citation\n|last=Edney\n|first=Jon\n|year=2004\n|chapter=What is an ESS?\n|title=IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee Meeting, July 2004\n|location=Piscataway, NJ\n|publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n|chapter-url=http://www.ieee802.org/21/doctree/2004_Meeting_Docs/2004-07_meeting_docs/21-04-0105-00-0000-what_ess.ppt\n}}.\n*{{citation\n|last=Lindqvist|first=Janne\n|last2=Aura|first2=Tuomas\n|last3=Danezis|first3=George\n|last4=Koponen|first4=Teemu\n|last5=Myllyniemi|first5=Annu\n|last6=M\u00e4ki|first6=Jussi\n|last7=Roe|first7=Michael\n|ref={{harvid|Lindqvist, et al|2009}}\n|chapter=Privacy-preserving 802.11 Access-point Discovery\n|pages=123{{ndash}}130\n|title=Proceedings of the Second ACM Conference on Wireless Network Security\n|series=WiSec '09\n|year=2009\n|location=New York|publisher=ACM\n|isbn=978-1-60558-460-7\n|doi=10.1145/1514274.1514293\n|citeseerx=10.1.1.206.4148\n}}.\n* {{citation\n|last=Murty|first=Rohan\n|last2=Padhye|first2=Jitendra\n|last3=Chandra|first3=Ranveer\n|last4=Wolman|first4=Alec\n|last5=Zill|first5=Brian\n|year=2008\n|chapter=Designing High Performance Enterprise Wi-Fi Networks\n|pages=73{{ndash}}88\n|chapter-url=http://static.usenix.org/event/nsdi08/tech/full_papers/murty/murty.pdf\n|title=Proceedings of the 5th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation\n|series=NSDI '08\n|editor-last=Crowcroft|editor-first=Jon\n|editor2-last=Dahlin|editor2-first=Mike\n|display-editors=etal\n|location=Berkeley, CA\n|publisher=USENIX Association\n|ref={{harvid|Murty, et al|2008}}\n}}.\n* {{citation\n|chapter-url=http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11p-2010.pdf\n|editor-last=Stacey|editor-first=Robert\n|editor2-last=Ecclesine|editor2-first=Peter\n|display-editors=etal\n|chapter={{null|Part 11: }}Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications, Amendment 6{{null|: Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments.}} (IEEE Std 802.11p-2010)\n|title=Local and Metropolitan Area Networks, Specific Requirements{{null|full title: 802.11p-2010 - IEEE Standard for Information technology--Telecommunications and information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks--Specific requirements - Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications, Amendment 6: Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments.}}\n|series=IEEE Standard for Information technology {{mdash}} Telecommunications and information exchange between systems\n|year=2010{{null|date=2010-07-15}}\n|location=Piscataway, NJ\n|publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n|isbn=978-0-7381-6324-6\n|ref={{harvid|IEEE Std 802.11p-2010}}\n}}.\n* {{citation\n|chapter-url=http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-2007.pdf{{null|full title: 802.11-2007 - IEEE Standard for Information technology--Telecommunications and information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks--Specific requirements - Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications}}\n|editor-last=Cole|editor-first=Terry L.\n|editor2-last=Barber|editor2-first=Simon\n|chapter={{null|Part 11: }}Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications (IEEE Std 802.11-2007)\n|title=Local and Metropolitan Area Networks, Specific Requirements\n|series=IEEE Standard for Information technology{{mdash}} Telecommunications and information exchange between systems.\n|year=2007|{{null|date=2007-06-12}}\n|location=Piscataway, NJ\n|publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n|isbn=978-0-7381-5656-9\n|ref={{harvid|IEEE Std 802.11-2007}}\n}}.\n* {{citation\n|title=Interconnecting Smart Objects with IP: The Next Internet\n|first=Jean-Philippe\n|last=Vasseur\n|first2=Adam\n|last2=Dunkels\n|location=Burlington, MA\n|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann\n|isbn=978-0-12-375166-9\n|year=2010\n}}.\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Wireless networking]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)"}

Nadezhdinsk became an important supplier of rails for the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. [[Dmitry Mendeleyev]], who visited Nadezhdinsk, was pleasantly surprised by the progressive technology used at the plant. The first school in Nadezhdinsk opened in December 1895, the first power plant (415&nbsp;kW) in 1907.\n\nThe [[Revolution of 1905]] affected Nadezhdinsk, with the turmoil continuing through 1908.

Klein Brothers machine-building factory relocated to Nadezhdinsk from [[Riga]] in 1917. The growing demand for workforce was met by hiring workers from China and Korea, as well as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs). There were 1,266 Chinese and Koreans, and 3,329 POWs in Nadezhdinsk in 1917.\n\nOn October&nbsp;27, 1917, two days after the [[October Revolution]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], power in the town bloodlessly transferred to the Worker's Soviet. On December&nbsp;18, 1917, Bogoslovsk Mining District, including the Nadezhdinsk plants, was nationalized. In October 1918, the army of the Provisional Government of Siberia, which opposed the Soviets in the [[Russian Civil War]], occupied Nadezhdinsk. On November&nbsp;20, 1918, two days after admiral [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]] become the head of the [[White movement|White government]] of Siberia, the [[White movement | \"whites\"]] in Nadezhdinsk executed twenty-three of their \"red\" opponents. On July&nbsp;19, 1919, [[Red Army|Red]] partisans, supporting the Soviets, re-took the settlement. It was devastated after the Civil War. None of the factories were working and many engineers left the area.\n\n15 September 1919 Nadezhdinsk gained town status.

Due to the shortage of males, who were conscripted into  active service, most steel jobs were taken by women. Numerous organizations evacuated to Serov from the Soviet territories occupied by Germans: hospitals from [[Polotsk]] and [[Smolensk]], and [[Lenkom Theater]] from [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]].\n\nAfter the war, demand for steel increased even more due to reconstruction. Serov became a major electrified railroad center and a new power plant was built. In 1958, Serov produced its first [[ferrosilicon]]. In the 1970s a timber factory and a gas pipeline were built.\n\nIn the early 1990s the failed reforms of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] brought the town economy to a record low level.

In the early days of the [[Russian colonization of Siberia]] the district had only a few minor villages. The situation changed in 1893, when the chief manager of [[Karpinsk | Bogoslovsk]] Mining District, [[Alexander Auerbakh]], proposed a construction of a cast iron and rail plant on the [[Kakva River]] near the end of an existing railroad.

The first steel and rails in Nadezhdinsk were produced in 1896. Nadezhdinsk became an important supplier of rails for the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. [[Dmitry Mendeleyev]], who visited Nadezhdinsk, was pleasantly surprised by the progressive technology used at the plant. The first school in Nadezhdinsk opened in December 1895, the first power plant (415&nbsp;kW) in 1907.\n\nThe [[Revolution of 1905]] affected Nadezhdinsk, with the turmoil continuing through 1908. At the beginning of [[World War I]], Nadezhdinsk industry was reshaped<ref>October 27, 1915 between the main artillery Directorate and the Chairman of the Theological mountain district state Councilor A.A. Polovtsov signed a contract for the supply of high-explosive bombs to howitzers.</ref> to meet the demands of the military. Klein Brothers machine-building factory relocated to Nadezhdinsk from [[Riga]] in 1917. The growing demand for workforce was met by hiring workers from China and Korea, as well as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs). There were 1,266 Chinese and Koreans, and 3,329 POWs in Nadezhdinsk in 1917.\n\nOn October&nbsp;27, 1917, two days after the [[October Revolution]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], power in the town bloodlessly transferred to the Worker's Soviet. On December&nbsp;18, 1917, Bogoslovsk Mining District, including the Nadezhdinsk plants, was nationalized. In October 1918, the army of the Provisional Government of Siberia, which opposed the Soviets in the [[Russian Civil War]], occupied Nadezhdinsk. On November&nbsp;20, 1918, two days after admiral [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]] become the head of the [[White movement|White government]] of Siberia, the [[White movement | \"whites\"]] in Nadezhdinsk executed twenty-three of their \"red\" opponents. On July&nbsp;19, 1919, [[Red Army|Red]] partisans, supporting the Soviets, re-took the settlement. It was devastated after the Civil War. None of the factories were working and many engineers left the area.\n\n15 September 1919 Nadezhdinsk gained town status.

Due to the shortage of males, who were conscripted into  active service, most steel jobs were taken by women. Numerous organizations evacuated to Serov from the Soviet territories occupied by Germans: hospitals from [[Polotsk]] and [[Smolensk]], and [[Lenkom Theater]] from [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]].\n\nAfter the war, demand for steel increased even more due to reconstruction.

He received no formal schooling, but by self-study he learned to read and write, and taught himself several ancient and modern languages.  At an early age he began working for a bookseller in [[Finsbury]], first as an [[errand boy]], and then as an [[apprentice]].\n\n==Career==\nWhile at Finsbury, Carpenter became acquainted with the [[philologist]] William Greenfield, editor of [[Samuel Bagster the Elder]]'s polyglot Bibles, and began co-editing ''Scripture Magazine'', which they eventually expanded into the four-volume work ''Critica Biblica'' in 1824\u20131827.<ref>Laurel Brake and Marysa Demoor, eds.: ''Dictionary of Nineteenth-Century Journalism'', Gent: Academia Press, 2009, pp. 97-98.</ref>  This employment allowed him to devote time to literary pursuits, and he began writing theological and general works, establishing himself as contributor to and editor of numerous periodicals.  In 1830 he issued a series of ''Political Letters'' with which he attempted to defy the [[stamp duty on newspapers]], but in May 1831 he was tried and convicted of evading the law and was imprisoned.<ref name=\"Wiener 1969\">Joel H. Wiener: ''The War of the Unstamped, The Movement to Repeal the British Newspaper Tax, 1830-1836'', Cornell University Press, Ithaca & London, 1969, 310 pp.</ref>  While in prison, he edited a political magazine which was republished as ''Carpenter's Monthly Political Magazine'' in 1832.   He became intensely involved in the cause of political reform, publishing numerous tracts and books on the subject through the late 1840s.  He was a strong proponent of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement<ref>Ray Boston: ''British Chartists in America'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1971, p. 16.</ref> and a friend of [[William Cobbett]].<ref>Stephen & Lee, ''op. cit.''</ref>  He was also an active [[Freemason]] and contributor to the ''London Freemason'' magazine.<ref>Charles H.
