As a result, dozens of [[Network affiliate|affiliates]] refused to broadcast the episode when it was originally scheduled, substituting either a repeat from earlier in the season or a [[Thanksgiving]] [[TV special]] in its place. However, by the time of the summer rerun season six months later all the flak had died down, and the stations that refused to air the episode upon its first run reinstated it for the reruns the following summer.

Her performance led to several Emmy nominations over the course of the series and an Emmy win in 1988. Arthur decided to leave the show after seven years, and in 1992 the show was moved from [[NBC]] to [[CBS]] and retooled as ''[[The Golden Palace]]'' in which the other three actresses reprised their roles, with [[Cheech Marin]] as their new foil.

In a 2018 interview with the American website [[Dread Central]], Barbeau shared some of her feelings about her friend:{{quote|I was doing an interview for this one-woman show that I am doing and the interviewer asked, \"What do people usually ask you,\" and I said, \"They always want to know what it was like working with Bea.\" She was fantastic and, you know, I realized years later how much I took it for granted because it was my first experience on television.  I just assumed that everyone was as giving as she was, as professional as she was, that everyone who was doing a TV show showed up knowing their lines and showed up on time and was willing to say to the writers, \"I think this line was funnier if Adie had said it or Conrad had said it or Bill had said it.\"  I mean, she was just the best, she was the best, very funny. She was not Maude when she wasn't saying those lines. I don't know if I'd say she was quiet. She was a homebody. She had her sons, her dog and her cooking and she wasn't into the celebrity scene and she was a great lady. I loved her dearly and we had a great cast and they were my family for six years. I loved each of them and all of them and it was the best experience anyone could've had, being introduced to television like that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/268471/brainwaves-episode-80-legendary-actress-adrienne-barbeau-listen-now|title=Brainwaves Episode 80: Legendary Actress Adrienne Barbeau|publisher=dreadcentral.com|date=March 8, 2018 |accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\nA private and introverted woman according to her friends,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/celebrity/betty-white-rue-mcclanahan-recall-shy-bea-arthur|title=Betty White, Rue McClanahan Recall 'Shy' Bea Arthur|publisher=People.com|date=April 27, 2009|accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref> Arthur died of cancer at her home in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood area of Los Angeles]] on April 25, 2009.

It was written by [[Julian of Norwich]], about whom almost nothing is known. The book is remarkable for being the earliest surviving example of a book in the [[English language]] known to have been written by a woman.\n\nJulian, who lived all her life in the English city of [[Norwich]], wrote about the sixteen mystical visions or \"shewings\" she received in 1373, when she was in her thirties. Whilst seriously ill, and believing to be on her deathbed, the visions appeared to her over a period of several hours in one night, with a final revelation occurring the following night. After making a full recovery, she wrote an account of each vision, producing a [[manuscript]] now referred to as the ''Short Text''. She developed her ideas over a period of decades, whilst living as an [[Anchorite|anchoress]] in a cell attached to [[St Julian's Church, Norwich]], and wrote a far more extended version of her writings, now known as the ''Long Text''. She wrote straightforwardly in [[Middle English]].\n\nJulian's work was preserved by others. Various manuscripts of both the ''Long Text'' and the ''Short Text'', in addition to extracts, have survived, which have been used to produce many editions of her book, mainly in English, but also in other languages. The first publication of the book was a translation of the ''Long Text'' in 1670 by the English [[Benedictines|Benedictine monk]] [[Serenus de Cressy]].\n\n==Julian of Norwich==\n{{Main|Julian of Norwich}}\n[[File:Statue of Dame Julian.JPG|thumb|David Holgate's modern statue of [[Julian of Norwich]], depicted holding a copy of ''Revelations of Divine Love''.

It is the first book in [[English language|English]] known to have been written by a woman.{{sfn|Julian of Norwich|1998}} Throughout her life Julian lived in the city of [[Norwich]], an important commercial and religious centre in [[England in the Middle Ages|England during the Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=17}}{{sfn|Rawcliffe|Wilson|2004|p=158}} The [[Black Death in England|Black Death]] of 1348\u201350, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, and the suppression of the [[Lollardy|Lollards]], all occurred during her lifetime.{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=17}}{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|pp=25-6}} \n\nIn 1373, seriously ill and convinced she was close to death, the 30-year-old Julian received a series of [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] or 'shewings' of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]],{{sfn|Windeatt|2015|p=ix}} after which she recovered from her illness. Julian then lived the rest of her life as an anchoress, in a [[Monastic cell|cell]] attached to [[St Julian's Church, Norwich|St Julian's Church]].{{sfn|Baker|1993|p=148}}  Julian's true name and details of her life remain unknown, but she is known with certainty to have existed, as she was the recipient of a number of wills,{{sfn|Windeatt|2015|p=xiv}} and she is mentioned in an account by the celebrated mystic [[Margery Kempe]], who met her at her cell in Norwich.{{sfn|Windeatt|2015|p=viii}}\n\nJulian referred to herself in her writings as \"a simple creature unlettered\", a phrase perhaps used to avoid antagonising or offending her readers, especially in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.  The term ''unlettered'' in the [[Middle Ages]] might have meant that she did not receive a formal education, rarely available to laywomen.<ref name = \"Jantzen\">{{citation | last = Jantzen | first = G | title = Julian of Norwich: Mystic and Theologian | publisher = Paulist Press | year = 1988}}</ref>{{rp |15\u20136}} The city contained many [[Convent|convents]] whose orders recognized the importance of education. Many had boarding schools for girls, where they were taught to read and write.<ref name = \"Jantzen\" />{{rp |16}} Scholars are not sure whether Julian attended such a school. It is possible that Julian had an educated brother and she became literate through him.<ref name = \"Jantzen\" />{{rp |15\u20137}}\n\n==Julian's writings==\n''Revelations of Divine Love'' is unique, as no other work written by an English anchoress seems to have survived. In the 14th century, women in England were generally barred from high status clerical positions or other authoritative roles such as teaching, and their knowledge of Latin, the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the day, would have been limited. It is more likely that they read and wrote in [[Middle English]], their [[vernacular]] language, as Julian did.{{sfn|Leyser|2002|p=212}} Her life was contemporaneous with four other English [[Mysticism|mystics]], [[Walter Hilton]], [[Richard Rolle]], [[Margery Kempe]], and the unknown author of the work known as ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing|The Cloude of Unknowyng]]'', all of whom wrote in the vernacular.{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=7}} The historian [[Janina Ramirez]] has suggested that their use of Middle English was a sensible choice, considering the inexplicable nature of what they were attempting to describe.{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=7}}\n\nJulian's writings were not mentioned in medieval [[bequest]]s, as often happened for male authors.{{sfn|Rolf|2013|p=8}} Some Middle English spiritual texts were written for a specific readership, such as ''The Cloude of Unknowyng'', which was intended by the author to be read by a young [[hermit]], but Julian wrote as if for a general readership. There is no evidence that her writings influenced other medieval authors, or were read by more than a very few people until 1670, when her book was first published by [[Serenus de Cressy]] under the title ''XVI Revelations of Divine Love, Shewed to a Devout Servant of Our Lord, called Mother Juliana, an Anchorete of Norwich: Who lived in the Dayes of King Edward the Third''.<ref name=\"ADD\">{{cite web |url= https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/the-shewings-of-julian-of-norwich-introduction|title= The Shewings of Julian of Norwich: Introduction |last= Crampton|first= Georgia Ronan|date= 1994|series= Middle English Text Series|publisher= [[University of Rochester]]|location= New York|access-date= 15 February 2019}}</ref> Since then the book been published under a variety of different titles,{{sfn|Newman|2011|p=427}}{{refn|1=The usual title of Julian of Norwich's work, ''Revelations of Divine Love'', originated from the title provided by Cressy in 1670.

Complete versions of the ''Long Text'' survive in the form of three separate manuscripts, all dating from the sixteenth century.

It was written by [[Julian of Norwich]], about whom almost nothing is known. The book is remarkable for being the earliest surviving example of a book in the [[English language]] known to have been written by a woman.\n\nJulian, who lived all her life in the English city of [[Norwich]], wrote about the sixteen mystical visions or \"shewings\" she received in 1373, when she was in her thirties. Whilst seriously ill, and believing to be on her deathbed, the visions appeared to her over a period of several hours in one night, with a final revelation occurring the following night. After making a full recovery, she wrote an account of each vision, producing a [[manuscript]] now referred to as the ''Short Text''. She developed her ideas over a period of decades, whilst living as an [[Anchorite|anchoress]] in a cell attached to [[St Julian's Church, Norwich]], and wrote a far more extended version of her writings, now known as the ''Long Text''. She wrote straightforwardly in [[Middle English]].\n\nJulian's work was preserved by others. Various manuscripts of both the ''Long Text'' and the ''Short Text'', in addition to extracts, have survived, which have been used to produce many editions of her book, mainly in English, but also in other languages. The first publication of the book was a translation of the ''Long Text'' in 1670 by the English [[Benedictines|Benedictine monk]] [[Serenus de Cressy]].\n\n==Julian of Norwich==\n{{Main|Julian of Norwich}}\n[[File:Statue of Dame Julian.JPG|thumb|David Holgate's modern statue of [[Julian of Norwich]], depicted holding a copy of ''Revelations of Divine Love''.

It is the first book in [[English language|English]] known to have been written by a woman.{{sfn|Julian of Norwich|1998}} Throughout her life Julian lived in the city of [[Norwich]], an important commercial and religious centre in [[England in the Middle Ages|England during the Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=17}}{{sfn|Rawcliffe|Wilson|2004|p=158}} The [[Black Death in England|Black Death]] of 1348\u201350, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, and the suppression of the [[Lollardy|Lollards]], all occurred during her lifetime.{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=17}}{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|pp=25-6}} \n\nIn 1373, seriously ill and convinced she was close to death, the 30-year-old Julian received a series of [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] or 'shewings' of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]],{{sfn|Windeatt|2015|p=ix}} after which she recovered from her illness. Julian then lived the rest of her life as an anchoress, in a [[Monastic cell|cell]] attached to [[St Julian's Church, Norwich|St Julian's Church]].{{sfn|Baker|1993|p=148}}  Julian's true name and details of her life remain unknown, but she is known with certainty to have existed, as she was the recipient of a number of wills,{{sfn|Windeatt|2015|p=xiv}} and she is mentioned in an account by the celebrated mystic [[Margery Kempe]], who met her at her cell in Norwich.{{sfn|Windeatt|2015|p=viii}}\n\nJulian referred to herself in her writings as \"a simple creature unlettered\", a phrase perhaps used to avoid antagonising or offending her readers, especially in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.  The term ''unlettered'' in the [[Middle Ages]] might have meant that she did not receive a formal education, rarely available to laywomen.<ref name = \"Jantzen\">{{citation | last = Jantzen | first = G | title = Julian of Norwich: Mystic and Theologian | publisher = Paulist Press | year = 1988}}</ref>{{rp |15\u20136}} The city contained many [[Convent|convents]] whose orders recognized the importance of education. Many had boarding schools for girls, where they were taught to read and write.<ref name = \"Jantzen\" />{{rp |16}} Scholars are not sure whether Julian attended such a school. It is possible that Julian had an educated brother and she became literate through him.<ref name = \"Jantzen\" />{{rp |15\u20137}}\n\n==Julian's writings==\n''Revelations of Divine Love'' is unique, as no other work written by an English anchoress seems to have survived. In the 14th century, women in England were generally barred from high status clerical positions or other authoritative roles such as teaching, and their knowledge of Latin, the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the day, would have been limited. It is more likely that they read and wrote in [[Middle English]], their [[vernacular]] language, as Julian did.{{sfn|Leyser|2002|p=212}} Her life was contemporaneous with four other English [[Mysticism|mystics]], [[Walter Hilton]], [[Richard Rolle]], [[Margery Kempe]], and the unknown author of the work known as ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing|The Cloude of Unknowyng]]'', all of whom wrote in the vernacular.{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=7}} The historian [[Janina Ramirez]] has suggested that their use of Middle English was a sensible choice, considering the inexplicable nature of what they were attempting to describe.{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=7}}\n\nJulian's writings were not mentioned in medieval [[bequest]]s, as often happened for male authors.{{sfn|Rolf|2013|p=8}} Some Middle English spiritual texts were written for a specific readership, such as ''The Cloude of Unknowyng'', which was intended by the author to be read by a young [[hermit]], but Julian wrote as if for a general readership. There is no evidence that her writings influenced other medieval authors, or were read by more than a very few people until 1670, when her book was first published by [[Serenus de Cressy]] under the title ''XVI Revelations of Divine Love, Shewed to a Devout Servant of Our Lord, called Mother Juliana, an Anchorete of Norwich: Who lived in the Dayes of King Edward the Third''.<ref name=\"ADD\">{{cite web |url= https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/the-shewings-of-julian-of-norwich-introduction|title= The Shewings of Julian of Norwich: Introduction |last= Crampton|first= Georgia Ronan|date= 1994|series= Middle English Text Series|publisher= [[University of Rochester]]|location= New York|access-date= 15 February 2019}}</ref> Since then the book been published under a variety of different titles,{{sfn|Newman|2011|p=427}}{{refn|1=The usual title of Julian of Norwich's work, ''Revelations of Divine Love'', originated from the title provided by Cressy in 1670.

Complete versions of the ''Long Text'' survive in the form of three separate manuscripts, all dating from the sixteenth century. Another manuscript, known as [[Westminster Cathedral]] Treasury MS4, written between 1450 and 1500, includes extracts from the ''Long Text'' and the mystic Walter Hilton. It was discovered in 1955, and is now kept in [[Westminster Cathedral]]. \n\nA single manuscript of the earlier ''Short Text'', dating from the mid-fifteenth century, has survived. Now kept in the British Library, it is contained within \"Add MS 37790\",  also known as the Amherst Manuscript, an anthology of spiritual works written in Middle English.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?index=0&ref=Add_MS_37790 |title=A Carthusian anthology of theological works in English (the ''Amherst Manuscript'') |id=Add MS 37790 |series=Digitised Manuscripts |website= [[British Library]]}} On the [[folio]] pages 97r-115r, the text contains the rubric, \"''Here es a vision schewed be the goodenes of god to a devoute woman and hir name es Julyan that is recluse atte Norwyche and zitt ys on lyfe anno domini millesimo ccccxiii''\"</ref>\n\nA lost manuscript, \"Upholland MS\", was copied in the 1670s or 1680s by the exiled English Benedictine nun Barbara Constable in the French town of [[Cambrai]]. A copy of this manuscript is known to have been kept at [[Stanbrook Abbey]]. \n\n=== The ''Long Text'' ===\n[[File:Part of Chapter 1 of Revelations of Divine Love (BL MS 2499).jpg|thumb|Part of the first chapter of the ''Long Text'' ([[British Library|BL]], Sloane 2499).]]\nThe ''Long Text'', written and developed by Julian over a number of years, does not seem to have been widely circulated in late medieval England. The one surviving medieval manuscript, the mid- to late-15th century ''Westminster Manuscript'', contains a portion of the ''Long Text'', refashioned as a [[Didacticism|didactic]] treatise on contemplation.{{sfn|McGinn|2012|p=425}} \n\nThe three complete manuscripts of the text fall into two groups, with slightly different readings. The late 16th century ''Brigittine Long Text'' manuscript was produced by exiled nuns in the [[Antwerp]] region.

This is followed by a sentence or two describing each of the sixteen visions in turn.{{sfn|Cressy|1670|pp=1-4}} The second chapter is partly autobiographical. Julian mentions her illness, but in a spiritual manner. She reflects on three 'gifts' from God: meditation on the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], meditation on her own suffering and the gift of greater piety (which she calls 'wounds').{{sfn|Cressy|1670|pp=4-6}} In the third chapter, which concludes the introduction, Julian writes more concretely about the events of her illness and her preparation for death by receiving the [[Anointing of the Sick|last rites]].

Gray before 1850. The settlement was originally known as Prairie Valley when the [[Houston and Texas Central Railroad]] arrived in 1872.<ref name=\"Texas Handbook\">{{cite web | url = https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hgw11 | title = Wilmer, Texas | work = | publisher = [[The Handbook of Texas]] online | date =  | accessdate = 2009-08-19}}</ref> In 1884, the post office in Prairie Valley was renamed Wilmer, after A.J. Wilmer, a conductor on the Houston and Texas Central line. The population was estimated at 100 in 1890, with several stores and businesses operation in the community. That figure had risen to over 200 by the start of [[World War I]]. A fire destroyed most of Wilmer's business district on July 4, 1929. The community's shallow wells were unable to pump the adequate amount of water needed to extinguish the blaze.\n\nWilmer incorporated in 1945, and its first mayor, J.H. May, was elected on a platform of installing a water system. At the time of incorporation, Wilmer had 136 homes and a population of approximately 450. In 1949, a volunteer fire department was established and a fire truck was purchased. Around the same time, Wilmer and the neighboring city of [[Hutchins, Texas|Hutchins]] consolidated their schools.<ref name=\"Texas Escapes\"/> By 1960, Wilmer was home to 1,785 residents. Throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, Wilmer continued to grow, but at a much slower rate than other communities in Dallas County.<ref name=\"Texas Handbook\"/> With 3,393 residents as of the 2000 census, Wilmer is currently one of the smallest incorporated cities in Dallas County.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1950= 465\n|1960= 1785\n|1970= 1922\n|1980= 2367\n|1990= 2479\n|2000= 3393\n|2010= 3682\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=4766\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 3,393 people, 958 households, and 714 families residing in the city.

Wilmer, a conductor on the Houston and Texas Central line. The population was estimated at 100 in 1890, with several stores and businesses operation in the community. That figure had risen to over 200 by the start of [[World War I]]. A fire destroyed most of Wilmer's business district on July 4, 1929. The community's shallow wells were unable to pump the adequate amount of water needed to extinguish the blaze.\n\nWilmer incorporated in 1945, and its first mayor, J.H. May, was elected on a platform of installing a water system. At the time of incorporation, Wilmer had 136 homes and a population of approximately 450. In 1949, a volunteer fire department was established and a fire truck was purchased. Around the same time, Wilmer and the neighboring city of [[Hutchins, Texas|Hutchins]] consolidated their schools.<ref name=\"Texas Escapes\"/> By 1960, Wilmer was home to 1,785 residents. Throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, Wilmer continued to grow, but at a much slower rate than other communities in Dallas County.<ref name=\"Texas Handbook\"/> With 3,393 residents as of the 2000 census, Wilmer is currently one of the smallest incorporated cities in Dallas County.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1950= 465\n|1960= 1785\n|1970= 1922\n|1980= 2367\n|1990= 2479\n|2000= 3393\n|2010= 3682\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=4766\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 3,393 people, 958 households, and 714 families residing in the city.
