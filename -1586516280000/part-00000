By the time the baby is one year old, the proportions of different types of hemoglobin are expected to approximate the adult levels, with hemoglobin F reduced to very low levels.<ref name=\"Barbara2017\" /> \n\nIn healthy adults, the composition of hemoglobin is hemoglobin A (~97%), hemoglobin A2 (2.2 - 3.5%) and hemoglobin F (<1%).<ref name=\"Caroline 2012\">{{Cite journal | author=Caroline T & Andrew L| title= Physiology of haemoglobin| journal=[[Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care & Pain]] | volume=12(5) |year=2012 | pages=251\u2013256 | doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mks025 }}</ref>\n\nCertain genetic abnormalities can cause the switch to adult hemoglobin synthesis to fail, resulting in a condition known as [[hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin]] (HPFH).\n\n==Binding to oxygen==\n===Why hemoglobin F has higher oxygen affinity===\nThe 4 hemes, which are the oxygen-binding parts of hemoglobin, are similar between hemoglobin F and other types of hemoglobin, including hemoglobin A.

The system is situated within both [[Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg County]] and the [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax Regional Municipality]], beginning approximately {{Convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the [[Head of St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|Head of Saint Margarets Bay]] and approximately {{Convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Hammonds Plains, Nova Scotia|Hammonds Plains]]. The system is part of the East Indian River watershed and drains {{convert|271|km2|sqmi}}, with water storage provided in Lunenburg County by Mill Lake, Coon Pond, Sandy Lake, Wrights Lake, Big Indian Lake, Five Mile Lake and, at times, an overflow from [[Pockwock Lake]] in the Halifax Regional Municipality. The system is owned and operated by [[Nova Scotia Power]] Inc.\n\nSystem assets associated with the St. Margaret\u2019s Bay Hydro System, which represents six generating units with an operating capacity of 10.2 MW, include Beeswanger Dam, Five Mile Dam and Wing Dam 4, Mack Lake Main Dam, Five Mile Wing Dams 1,2 and 3, Big Indian Dam, Wright\u2019s Lake Dam, Coon Pond Dam, Sandy Lake Dam, Sandy Lake and Coon Pond Pipeline, Mill Lake Plant and Surge Tank, Little Indian Crossover, Mill Lake Dam, Tidewater Plant and Surge Tank, Tidewater Pipeline, as well as associated [[headpond]]s. Outflow is into [[St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia]] between [[Head of St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|Head of St. Margarets Bay]] and [[Tantallon, Nova Scotia|Tantallon]].\n\nCommissioned 8 June 1922, St. Margaret's Bay Hydroelectric System is the oldest hydro plant in Nova Scotia.\n\n==Technical characteristics==\n===Dams, Wing Dams, Spillways, and Canals===\nThere are 19 dams and wing dams of various heights, lengths and construction types holding back the lakes and reservoirs that make up the St. Margaret's Bay Hydroelectric System:<ref name=\"IRP\">{{cite web |title=Nova Scotia Power Incorporated Hydro Asset Study |url=https://irp.nspower.ca/files/key-documents/background-materials/20181221-NS-Power-Hydro-Asset-Study-REDACTED.pdf |website=Nova Scotia Power 2020 Integrated Resource Plan |publisher=Nova Scotia Power Inc. |accessdate=5 April 2020 |page=52 |format=pdf |date=December 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"height: 3em;\"\n!

The two principal storage areas for the Sandy Lake Development are Five Mile Lake and Big Indian Lake.\n\nOn the Eastern side of the system, drainage into Wright\u2019s Lake and Coon Pond, in addition to surplus water from Pockwock Lake (owned by Halifax Regional Municipality), supplies the Mill Lake Plant. The new Coon Pond Dam has water continually flowing out from a maintenance chute to ensure water is always feeding a stream leading to St. Margaret\u2019s Bay to maintain fish habitat in the stream.\n\nOutput water from the Sandy Lake and Mill Lake plants then flow into the Mill Lake Head Pond to supply the Tidewater Plant which outputs at sea level into St. Margaret's Bay.\n\nThe total elevation from the highest reservoir to sea level is {{Convert|134.2|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=ayling2014/> The St. Margaret's Bay Hydroelectric System has an annual output of 30 Gigawatt hours of electricity from two .6 MW generators at Mill Lake and two 2.9 MW generators at the Tidewater plant.<ref name=ayling2014>{{cite news|last= Ayling|first= Keith|date= 18 June 2014|year= |title= St Margaret\u2019s Bay Power Plant Opens its System to Public|url= http://www.themastheadnews.ca/images/Issues/June_18_Masthead_News.pdf| format= pdf |newspaper= Masthead News|location= |publisher= |publication-date= 18 June 2014|agency= |page= 12|accessdate= 16 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nova Scotia DSC03226 - Generators (8475707265).jpg|thumb|The Generators were made by General Electric Co limited from Peterborough, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|left]]\n===Mill Lake Generating Station===\nLocated on the Northeast River.

He\u2019d seen speckled trout and smallmouth bass, but no gaspereau.\n\nPettipas was working on another project the day the biologist saw the three gaspereau. He headed out to the fish ladder the next day and dipped his underwater live view camera into the fishway. It turns out there were so many gaspereau he didn\u2019t need the camera.\n\n \u201cWe saw many gaspereau throughout the ladder as well as speckled trout, smallmouth bass and a white sucker,\u201d Pettipas said.\n\n \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if the gaspereau would come back or not,\u201d said senior environmental scientist Jay Walmsley. That\u2019s because it had been generations since gaspereau last spawned in this river system.\n\nThe intent of the ladder is to ensure the passage of species of fish that have to migrate to fulfill their life cycles, such as gaspereau and the endangered Southern Upland [[Atlantic salmon]]. Gaspereau swim up the river in the spring to spawn in the still waters of the lake then swim back to sea in the fall.\n\n \u201cGaspereau tend to go back to spawn in the same river that they\u2019re used to. They imprint on the steam on their way out, and when they come back to spawn, most go up the river they were born in,\u201d Walmsley said.\n\nBut it seems the new fish ladder, through both its design and the 30 cubic feet per second of water that flows through it, created enough white, bubbly water in the river to attract some of the fish to the ladder.\n\nFrom the ladder, the fish will make their way to Sandy Lake.\n\n \u201cGaspereau are important because they bring nutrients from the ocean and the more different types of fish we have in the system, the greater the diversity and productivity, and the healthier the system,\u201d Walmsley said. \u201cThey are very beneficial to the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nWalmsley said this success holds tremendous potential.

The system is situated within both [[Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg County]] and the [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax Regional Municipality]], beginning approximately {{Convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the [[Head of St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|Head of Saint Margarets Bay]] and approximately {{Convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Hammonds Plains, Nova Scotia|Hammonds Plains]]. The system is part of the East Indian River watershed and drains {{convert|271|km2|sqmi}}, with water storage provided in Lunenburg County by Mill Lake, Coon Pond, Sandy Lake, Wrights Lake, Big Indian Lake, Five Mile Lake and, at times, an overflow from [[Pockwock Lake]] in the Halifax Regional Municipality. The system is owned and operated by [[Nova Scotia Power]] Inc.\n\nSystem assets associated with the St. Margaret\u2019s Bay Hydro System, which represents six generating units with an operating capacity of 10.2 MW, include Beeswanger Dam, Five Mile Dam and Wing Dam 4, Mack Lake Main Dam, Five Mile Wing Dams 1,2 and 3, Big Indian Dam, Wright\u2019s Lake Dam, Coon Pond Dam, Sandy Lake Dam, Sandy Lake and Coon Pond Pipeline, Mill Lake Plant and Surge Tank, Little Indian Crossover, Mill Lake Dam, Tidewater Plant and Surge Tank, Tidewater Pipeline, as well as associated [[headpond]]s. Outflow is into [[St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia]] between [[Head of St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|Head of St. Margarets Bay]] and [[Tantallon, Nova Scotia|Tantallon]].\n\nCommissioned 8 June 1922, St. Margaret's Bay Hydroelectric System is the oldest hydro plant in Nova Scotia.\n\n==Technical characteristics==\n===Dams, Wing Dams, Spillways, and Canals===\nThere are 19 dams and wing dams of various heights, lengths and construction types holding back the lakes and reservoirs that make up the St. Margaret's Bay Hydroelectric System:<ref name=\"IRP\">{{cite web |title=Nova Scotia Power Incorporated Hydro Asset Study |url=https://irp.nspower.ca/files/key-documents/background-materials/20181221-NS-Power-Hydro-Asset-Study-REDACTED.pdf |website=Nova Scotia Power 2020 Integrated Resource Plan |publisher=Nova Scotia Power Inc. |accessdate=5 April 2020 |page=52 |format=pdf |date=December 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"height: 3em;\"\n!

He\u2019d seen speckled trout and smallmouth bass, but no gaspereau.\n\nPettipas was working on another project the day the biologist saw the three gaspereau. He headed out to the fish ladder the next day and dipped his underwater live view camera into the fishway. It turns out there were so many gaspereau he didn\u2019t need the camera.\n\n \u201cWe saw many gaspereau throughout the ladder as well as speckled trout, smallmouth bass and a white sucker,\u201d Pettipas said.\n\n \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if the gaspereau would come back or not,\u201d said senior environmental scientist Jay Walmsley. That\u2019s because it had been generations since gaspereau last spawned in this river system.\n\nThe intent of the ladder is to ensure the passage of species of fish that have to migrate to fulfill their life cycles, such as gaspereau and the endangered Southern Upland [[Atlantic salmon]]. Gaspereau swim up the river in the spring to spawn in the still waters of the lake then swim back to sea in the fall.\n\n \u201cGaspereau tend to go back to spawn in the same river that they\u2019re used to. They imprint on the steam on their way out, and when they come back to spawn, most go up the river they were born in,\u201d Walmsley said.\n\nBut it seems the new fish ladder, through both its design and the 30 cubic feet per second of water that flows through it, created enough white, bubbly water in the river to attract some of the fish to the ladder.\n\nFrom the ladder, the fish will make their way to Sandy Lake.\n\n \u201cGaspereau are important because they bring nutrients from the ocean and the more different types of fish we have in the system, the greater the diversity and productivity, and the healthier the system,\u201d Walmsley said. \u201cThey are very beneficial to the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nWalmsley said this success holds tremendous potential. It\u2019s hoped the fish will eventually extend to the whole catchment area of the Indian River.<ref name=\"gaspereau\">{{cite news |title=Swimming against the current: more than a century later, gaspereau are back |url=https://www.nspower.ca/about-us/press-releases/details/2016/05/25/swimming-against-the-current-more-than-a-century-later-gaspereau-are-back |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=Press Release |publisher=Nova Scotia Power |date=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Commons category|St. Margaret's Bay Hydroelectric System}}\n\n==External links==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Canada|Water|Renewable energy}}}}\n* [http://www.st-margaretsbay.com/stmargaretsbay_hydro_plants.html St.Margarets Bay Hydro-electricity Plants, Green Renewable Power Since 1922] at St. Margaret's Bay.com\n\n[[Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:Nova Scotia Power]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Halifax, Nova Scotia]]\n\n{{Hydroelectric-power-plant-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ken Heaton", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Margaret%27s_Bay_Hydroelectric_System"}
