It is programmed by its in-house production studio, [[Williams Street]]. It currently broadcasts nightly from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]. The block is marketed as a separate network from Cartoon Network for ratings purposes, similar to the [[Nick at Nite|Nick At Nite]] block on [[Nickelodeon]].\n\nDebuting in 2001, Adult Swim serves as the nighttime identity of Cartoon Network, and was established as alternative programming during the late night hours when Cartoon Network's primary target audience, children between the ages of 7 and 15, would normally be sleeping. In 2005, the block was granted its own [[Nielsen ratings]] report from Cartoon Network due to targeting a separate demographic. The block features stylistically varied animated and live-action shows; including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series, [[anime]], [[original video animation]], and [[short film]]s with generally minimal or no editing for content.\n\nThe block has frequently aired [[adult animation]] features, [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]], [[sketch comedy]], and [[Television pilot|pilots]]. The block's shows are known for their sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence. Many of its programs are aesthetically [[experimental]], transgressive, improvised, and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] in nature. This has become a source of conflict, with some saying that Adult Swim is too controversial, while others noting that its ability to question the norm brings a level of surrealism and experimentalism that is welcome. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in [[absurdity|absurd]] and [[shock value|shock]] comedy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|title=Thinking small|website=Channelweb.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105222547/http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|archive-date=January 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs with Cartoon Network, Adult Swim's reach through various services totals 94 million American households.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|title=Cable network coverage area household universe estimates: January 2016 \u2013 Broadcasting & Cable|website=Broadcastingcable.com|accessdate=November 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202182549/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|archive-date=December 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Creation and development ===\n{{See also|Space Ghost Coast to Coast}}\n[[Cartoon Network]]'s original head programmer, [[Mike Lazzo]], conceived<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|title=Frederator Studios Blogs \u2013 Fred Seibert's Blog \u2013 Dinner at [adult swim].|website=Archives.frederatorblogs.com|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630142003/http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Adult Swim. The block grew out of Cartoon Network's previous attempts at airing content appropriate for teenagers and young adults who might be watching the channel after 11 pm (ET/PT). The network began experimenting with its late night programming by airing anthology shows that presented uncensored classic cartoon shorts, such as ''[[ToonHeads]]'', ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]'', ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[Late Night Black and White]]'', and ''[[O Canada (TV series)|O Canada]]''. Another block, [[Toonami]]'s \"Midnight Run\", aired the network's action programming uncut with minimal edits. In numerous interviews, it had been stated that at the time, one third of Cartoon Network's audience were adults.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/27/movies/after-14-years-one-network-for-children-refocuses-while-another-5-gets-wackier.html|title=After 14 Years, One Network For Children Refocuses . . .

That was followed by the ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' episode [[List of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! episodes|\"Tommy\"]], which featured the star and director of the film [[Tommy Wiseau]].\n* In 2010, Adult Swim re-aired ''The Room'' for a second year in a row, with bumps featuring [[Tommy Wiseau]] being interviewed on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''. Sex scenes remained censored, but the [[TV Parental Guidelines|parental rating]] was raised to TV-MA.\n* In 2011, ''The Room'' was aired once again with the TV-MA rating and was followed by a 15-minute special titled ''Earth Ghost'', a CGI version of the ''Lowe Country'' pilot shown on [[Adult Swim Video]] in 2007.\n* In 2012, Adult Swim replaced its lineup with [[Toonami]], a former programming block from [[Cartoon Network]]. After first playing the opening sequence of ''The Room'', the scene switched to the Toonami host T.O.M. noting that it was April Fools' Day before introducing that week's scheduled episode of ''[[Bleach (TV series)|Bleach]]''. The Toonami bumps and programming would continue throughout the night, featuring ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo!

T.O.M. also presented a review of ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' and promoted the recent DVD releases of the series featured.

The episode \"[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]\" aired repeatedly from 8pm until midnight on TV (shortening [[Toonami]] in the process and pre-empting premieres of ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''), and was also streaming on a loop on the adultswim.com streams all night. The bumps included new commissioned idents related to ''Rick and Morty'' and announcement promos of upcoming shows and seasons.\n* On March 31, 2018, Toonami premiered the first episode of ''[[FLCL|FLCL Alternative]]'', the show's third season (even as the second season had not been aired yet), albeit in Japanese with English subtitles, breaking Toonami's policy of only playing dubbed anime. Following ''FLCL'', the 2004 film ''[[Mind Game (film)|Mind Game]]'', directed by [[Masaaki Yuasa]], was played. Most of Toonami's scheduled programming for that night (featuring ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders]], [[Hunter \u00d7 Hunter]], [[Naruto: Shippuden (season 10)|Naruto: Shippuden]], [[Space Dandy]], [[Cowboy Bebop]] & [[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG]]'') were pushed back to 2:45&nbsp;a.m. after the film, and aired subbed instead of dubbed. The short ''Scavengers'' finished off the block at 5:45&nbsp;a.m. The block aired special bumpers with T.O.M. and S.A.R.A. and a game review of ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', all dubbed to Japanese with English subtitles and pink colors instead of the usual green. The Adult Swim logo was also changed to Japanese (stylized as [\u30a2\u30c0\u30eb\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30e0]), affecting both bumps and the channel bug. Block runner Jason DeMarco confirmed on Twitter that all original scheduled programming that was affected by the English subtitled joke after ''Mind Game'' would air the same episode dubbed the following week.\n* On April 1, 2018, in yet another rare double prank, Adult Swim aired normally until 11:00&nbsp;p.m., when it started airing an animated parody of ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' titled \"Bushworld Adventures\", created by Michael R. Cusack.<ref>{{Citation|last=Adult Swim|title=Bushworld Adventures {{!}} Adult Swim|date=2018-04-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|accessdate=2018-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406054404/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|archive-date=April 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It follows Rick and Morty in [[Australia]] going on wild adventures in search to find the green cube that was left at Bendigo. It looped three more times until midnight, pre-empting ''Rick and Morty'' and two ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]'' reruns in the process. All of Adult Swim's nature-themed bumpers that aired throughout the hour were Australian-themed. This special short was also simulcasted on a loop in a marathon stream on adultswim.com all night.\n* In 2019, regular programming was replaced, beginning at midnight, with the debut of ''[[G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu]]'', an anime parody that aired until 5:45am, when an episode of ''[[Off the Air (TV series)|Off the Air]]'' played as a buffer between it and Cartoon Network's sign-on at 6am. It was simulcast both on TV and on Adult Swim's online live stream. It additionally served as the premiere series for the new 24/7 [[Adult Swim (Canada)|Adult Swim]] network in [[Canada]].\n* In 2020, regular programming was replaced again. The intro for a second season of ''G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu'' was played, but it would be interrupted by [[Post Malone]], who would host several bumpers (along with [[Swae Lee]] later on in the block) introducing stealth premieres of new seasons of ''[[Primal (TV series)|Primal]]'', ''[[Dream Corp LLC]]'', ''[[Tigtone]]'', ''[[The Shivering Truth]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Lazor Wulf]]'', ''[[12 oz. Mouse]]'', and ''[[Tender Touches]]''. The stealth premiere block also showcased pilots of new shows ''YOLO: Crystal Fantasy'', ''JJ Villard's Fairy Tales'' and ''Smiling Friends''. Malone would also make silent cameos on said shows via green screen.<ref>https://comicbook.com/anime/2020/04/01/adult-swim-april-fools-day-primal-new-episodes-reaction/</ref>\n\n=== Alternate reality games ===\n[[File:Adult Swim ARG first transmission from Delilah Aug 2017.png|thumb|right|alt=A black screen with the text \"Hello my name is D.E.L.I.L.A.H.\"|Image from part of the ARG transmission that aired on August 27, 2017.

This new account informed everyone that they were searching for their missing sister named Amelia. The bump transmissions then started referring viewers to this new Twitter account as well as several new [[Instagram]] accounts, continuing to provide puzzles that required solving. Some players have used [[Discord (software)|Discord]] to work together as a team in a dedicated server to solve the puzzles and share theories about the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discord.gg/HtGAT5T|title=Discord \u2013 Free voice and text chat for gamers|website=Discord|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref> The ARG has been consistently broadcasting new messages and puzzles every Sunday since the initial August 2017 broadcast, with only a short hiatus during the 2017 holiday break. On March 25, 2018 it was revealed that Amelia was safe and had been for quite some time. Players learned that Amelia's messages asking for help were actually sent 3 years prior and that their delay in being received was caused by [[time dilation]]. This revelation effectively completed the second chapter of the ARG, it also alluded to the next phase which has just started as of June 2018.\n\n== Programming ==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Adult Swim|List of programs broadcast by Toonami}}\nOriginal shows currently in-production and seen on Adult Swim include ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Squidbillies]]'', ''[[Black Jesus (TV series)|Black Jesus]]'', ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', and ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]''. Adult Swim is best known for its inaugural slate of programming, which were parodies and remakes based on [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons (including ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' and ''[[Sealab 2021]]'').\n\nAdult Swim also airs [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs acquired from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] (such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Bob's Burgers]]''), original series produced for sister network [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] (''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Final Space]]''), and acquired and co-produced [[anime]] series. Adult Swim is currently one of the only networks in the United States that airs anime (besides [[Disney XD]]) and the only network that airs such programming aimed at young adults and teens rather than children.\n\nCurrently, anime and most [[Action film|action]]-genre programming air every Saturday night as part of [[Toonami]], a former Cartoon Network programming block that was relaunched as part of Adult Swim on May 26, 2012 as a \"block-within-a-block\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Cartoon Network shows that have gained a following among older viewers have also aired on Toonami; in particular, ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' proved popular enough in reruns to warrant a [[Samurai Jack (season 5)|revival]] in 2017.

In June 2010, they began delaying episode availability on Adult Swim Video by one week after original television broadcast. Previously, episodes had appeared 1\u20133 days after broadcast.

Currently apps are available in the [[United States|U.S. only]] for the [[Amazon Fire TV]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (including [[Android TV]]), [[Apple TV]], [[iOS]], [[Chromecast]], [[Roku]] and [[Xbox One]]. Due to licensing agreements certain parts of the apps including access to the live stream and past shows require the viewer to use their subscription-television provider or OTT-platform username and password to authenticate their right to access such content. A downside to these apps is the fact that, unlike free-to-air television, they are not currently compliant with U.S. [[Closed captioning]] requirements.\n\n== International ==\n[[File:Mapa Adult Swim.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=World map with the United States, Canada, Brazil, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, Russia, Tasmania, and New Zealand highlighted.|Adult Swim's international channel availability.]]\nAdult Swim has been actively expanding its reach across the world since 2005.

It is programmed by its in-house production studio, [[Williams Street]]. It currently broadcasts nightly from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]. The block is marketed as a separate network from Cartoon Network for ratings purposes, similar to the [[Nick at Nite|Nick At Nite]] block on [[Nickelodeon]].\n\nDebuting in 2001, Adult Swim serves as the nighttime identity of Cartoon Network, and was established as alternative programming during the late night hours when Cartoon Network's primary target audience, children between the ages of 7 and 15, would normally be sleeping. In 2005, the block was granted its own [[Nielsen ratings]] report from Cartoon Network due to targeting a separate demographic. The block features stylistically varied animated and live-action shows; including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series, [[anime]], [[original video animation]], and [[short film]]s with generally minimal or no editing for content.\n\nThe block has frequently aired [[adult animation]] features, [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]], [[sketch comedy]], and [[Television pilot|pilots]]. The block's shows are known for their sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence. Many of its programs are aesthetically [[experimental]], transgressive, improvised, and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] in nature. This has become a source of conflict, with some saying that Adult Swim is too controversial, while others noting that its ability to question the norm brings a level of surrealism and experimentalism that is welcome. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in [[absurdity|absurd]] and [[shock value|shock]] comedy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|title=Thinking small|website=Channelweb.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105222547/http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|archive-date=January 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs with Cartoon Network, Adult Swim's reach through various services totals 94 million American households.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|title=Cable network coverage area household universe estimates: January 2016 \u2013 Broadcasting & Cable|website=Broadcastingcable.com|accessdate=November 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202182549/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|archive-date=December 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Creation and development ===\n{{See also|Space Ghost Coast to Coast}}\n[[Cartoon Network]]'s original head programmer, [[Mike Lazzo]], conceived<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|title=Frederator Studios Blogs \u2013 Fred Seibert's Blog \u2013 Dinner at [adult swim].|website=Archives.frederatorblogs.com|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630142003/http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Adult Swim. The block grew out of Cartoon Network's previous attempts at airing content appropriate for teenagers and young adults who might be watching the channel after 11 pm (ET/PT). The network began experimenting with its late night programming by airing anthology shows that presented uncensored classic cartoon shorts, such as ''[[ToonHeads]]'', ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]'', ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[Late Night Black and White]]'', and ''[[O Canada (TV series)|O Canada]]''. Another block, [[Toonami]]'s \"Midnight Run\", aired the network's action programming uncut with minimal edits. In numerous interviews, it had been stated that at the time, one third of Cartoon Network's audience were adults.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/27/movies/after-14-years-one-network-for-children-refocuses-while-another-5-gets-wackier.html|title=After 14 Years, One Network For Children Refocuses . . .

That was followed by the ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' episode [[List of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! episodes|\"Tommy\"]], which featured the star and director of the film [[Tommy Wiseau]].\n* In 2010, Adult Swim re-aired ''The Room'' for a second year in a row, with bumps featuring [[Tommy Wiseau]] being interviewed on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''. Sex scenes remained censored, but the [[TV Parental Guidelines|parental rating]] was raised to TV-MA.\n* In 2011, ''The Room'' was aired once again with the TV-MA rating and was followed by a 15-minute special titled ''Earth Ghost'', a CGI version of the ''Lowe Country'' pilot shown on [[Adult Swim Video]] in 2007.\n* In 2012, Adult Swim replaced its lineup with [[Toonami]], a former programming block from [[Cartoon Network]]. After first playing the opening sequence of ''The Room'', the scene switched to the Toonami host T.O.M. noting that it was April Fools' Day before introducing that week's scheduled episode of ''[[Bleach (TV series)|Bleach]]''. The Toonami bumps and programming would continue throughout the night, featuring ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo!

T.O.M. also presented a review of ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' and promoted the recent DVD releases of the series featured.

The episode \"[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]\" aired repeatedly from 8pm until midnight on TV (shortening [[Toonami]] in the process and pre-empting premieres of ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''), and was also streaming on a loop on the adultswim.com streams all night. The bumps included new commissioned idents related to ''Rick and Morty'' and announcement promos of upcoming shows and seasons.\n* On March 31, 2018, Toonami premiered the first episode of ''[[FLCL|FLCL Alternative]]'', the show's third season (even as the second season had not been aired yet), albeit in Japanese with English subtitles, breaking Toonami's policy of only playing dubbed anime. Following ''FLCL'', the 2004 film ''[[Mind Game (film)|Mind Game]]'', directed by [[Masaaki Yuasa]], was played. Most of Toonami's scheduled programming for that night (featuring ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders]], [[Hunter \u00d7 Hunter]], [[Naruto: Shippuden (season 10)|Naruto: Shippuden]], [[Space Dandy]], [[Cowboy Bebop]] & [[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG]]'') were pushed back to 2:45&nbsp;a.m. after the film, and aired subbed instead of dubbed. The short ''Scavengers'' finished off the block at 5:45&nbsp;a.m. The block aired special bumpers with T.O.M. and S.A.R.A. and a game review of ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', all dubbed to Japanese with English subtitles and pink colors instead of the usual green. The Adult Swim logo was also changed to Japanese (stylized as [\u30a2\u30c0\u30eb\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30e0]), affecting both bumps and the channel bug. Block runner Jason DeMarco confirmed on Twitter that all original scheduled programming that was affected by the English subtitled joke after ''Mind Game'' would air the same episode dubbed the following week.\n* On April 1, 2018, in yet another rare double prank, Adult Swim aired normally until 11:00&nbsp;p.m., when it started airing an animated parody of ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' titled \"Bushworld Adventures\", created by Michael R. Cusack.<ref>{{Citation|last=Adult Swim|title=Bushworld Adventures {{!}} Adult Swim|date=2018-04-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|accessdate=2018-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406054404/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|archive-date=April 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It follows Rick and Morty in [[Australia]] going on wild adventures in search to find the green cube that was left at Bendigo. It looped three more times until midnight, pre-empting ''Rick and Morty'' and two ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]'' reruns in the process. All of Adult Swim's nature-themed bumpers that aired throughout the hour were Australian-themed. This special short was also simulcasted on a loop in a marathon stream on adultswim.com all night.\n* In 2019, regular programming was replaced, beginning at midnight, with the debut of ''[[G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu]]'', an anime parody that aired until 5:45am, when an episode of ''[[Off the Air (TV series)|Off the Air]]'' played as a buffer between it and Cartoon Network's sign-on at 6am. It was simulcast both on TV and on Adult Swim's online live stream. It additionally served as the premiere series for the new 24/7 [[Adult Swim (Canada)|Adult Swim]] network in [[Canada]].\n* In 2020, regular programming was replaced again. The intro for a second season of ''G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu'' was played, but it would be interrupted by [[Post Malone]], who would host several bumpers (along with [[Swae Lee]] later on in the block) introducing stealth premieres of new seasons of ''[[Primal (TV series)|Primal]]'', ''[[Dream Corp LLC]]'', ''[[Tigtone]]'', ''[[The Shivering Truth]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Lazor Wulf]]'', ''[[12 oz. Mouse]]'', and ''[[Tender Touches]]''. The stealth premiere block also showcased pilots of new shows ''YOLO: Crystal Fantasy'', ''JJ Villard's Fairy Tales'' and ''Smiling Friends''. Malone would also make silent cameos on said shows via green screen.<ref>https://comicbook.com/anime/2020/04/01/adult-swim-april-fools-day-primal-new-episodes-reaction/</ref>\n\n=== Alternate reality games ===\n[[File:Adult Swim ARG first transmission from Delilah Aug 2017.png|thumb|right|alt=A black screen with the text \"Hello my name is D.E.L.I.L.A.H.\"|Image from part of the ARG transmission that aired on August 27, 2017.

This new account informed everyone that they were searching for their missing sister named Amelia. The bump transmissions then started referring viewers to this new Twitter account as well as several new [[Instagram]] accounts, continuing to provide puzzles that required solving. Some players have used [[Discord (software)|Discord]] to work together as a team in a dedicated server to solve the puzzles and share theories about the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discord.gg/HtGAT5T|title=Discord \u2013 Free voice and text chat for gamers|website=Discord|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref> The ARG has been consistently broadcasting new messages and puzzles every Sunday since the initial August 2017 broadcast, with only a short hiatus during the 2017 holiday break. On March 25, 2018 it was revealed that Amelia was safe and had been for quite some time. Players learned that Amelia's messages asking for help were actually sent 3 years prior and that their delay in being received was caused by [[time dilation]]. This revelation effectively completed the second chapter of the ARG, it also alluded to the next phase which has just started as of June 2018.\n\n== Programming ==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Adult Swim|List of programs broadcast by Toonami}}\nOriginal shows currently in-production and seen on Adult Swim include ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Squidbillies]]'', ''[[Black Jesus (TV series)|Black Jesus]]'', ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', and ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]''. Adult Swim is best known for its inaugural slate of programming, which were parodies and remakes based on [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons (including ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' and ''[[Sealab 2021]]'').\n\nAdult Swim also airs [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs acquired from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] (such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Bob's Burgers]]''), original series produced for sister network [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] (''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Final Space]]''), and acquired and co-produced [[anime]] series. Adult Swim is currently one of the only networks in the United States that airs anime (besides [[Disney XD]]) and the only network that airs such programming aimed at young adults and teens rather than children.\n\nCurrently, anime and most [[Action film|action]]-genre programming air every Saturday night as part of [[Toonami]], a former Cartoon Network programming block that was relaunched as part of Adult Swim on May 26, 2012 as a \"block-within-a-block\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Cartoon Network shows that have gained a following among older viewers have also aired on Toonami; in particular, ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' proved popular enough in reruns to warrant a [[Samurai Jack (season 5)|revival]] in 2017.

In June 2010, they began delaying episode availability on Adult Swim Video by one week after original television broadcast. Previously, episodes had appeared 1\u20133 days after broadcast.

Currently apps are available in the [[United States|U.S. only]] for the [[Amazon Fire TV]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (including [[Android TV]]), [[Apple TV]], [[iOS]], [[Chromecast]], [[Roku]] and [[Xbox One]]. Due to licensing agreements certain parts of the apps including access to the live stream and past shows require the viewer to use their subscription-television provider or OTT-platform username and password to authenticate their right to access such content. A downside to these apps is the fact that, unlike free-to-air television, they are not currently compliant with U.S. [[Closed captioning]] requirements.\n\n== International ==\n[[File:Mapa Adult Swim.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=World map with the United States, Canada, Brazil, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, Russia, Tasmania, and New Zealand highlighted.|Adult Swim's international channel availability.]]\nAdult Swim has been actively expanding its reach across the world since 2005.

{"title_page": "Density of states", "text_new": "{{condensed matter physics}}\nIn  [[solid state physics]] and [[condensed matter physics]], the '''density of states''' ('''DOS''') of a system describes the number of states that are  to be occupied by the system at each level of energy. It is mathematically represented as a distribution by a [[probability density function]], and it is generally an average over the space and time domains of the various states occupied by the system. The density of states is directly related to the [[dispersion relation]]s of the properties of the system. High DOS at a specific energy level means that many states are available for occupation.\n\nGenerally, the density of states of matter is continuous. In [[isolated system]]s however, such as atoms or molecules in the gas phase, the density distribution is [[Discrete distribution|discrete]], like a [[spectral density]]. Local variations, most often due to distortions of the original system, are often called '''local density of states''' (LDOS).\n\n==Introduction==\nIn quantum mechanical systems, waves, or wave-like particles, can occupy modes or states with wavelengths and propagation directions dictated by the system. For example, in some systems, the interatomic spacing and the atomic charge of a material could allow only electrons of certain wavelengths to exist. In other systems, the crystalline structure of a material could allow waves to propagate in one direction, while suppressing wave propagation in another direction. Often, only specific states are permitted. Thus, it can happen that many states are available for occupation at a specific energy level, while no states are available at other energy levels .\n\nFor an electron in the conduction band, an increase of the electron energy makes more states available for occupation. Alternatively, the density of state is discontinuous for an interval of energy, which means that no states are available for electrons to occupy within the band gap of the material. This condition also means that an electron at the conduction band edge must lose at least the band gap energy of the material in order to transition to another state in the valence band.\n\nDepending on the quantum mechanical system, the density of states can be calculated for [[electron]]s, [[photon]]s, or [[phonon]]s, and can be given as a function of either energy or the [[wave vector]] ''k''. To convert between the DOS as a function of the energy and the DOS as a function of the wave vector, the system-specific energy dispersion relation between ''E'' and ''k'' must be known.\n\nIn general, the topological properties of the system have a major impact on the properties of the density of states. The most well-known systems, like [[neutronium]] in [[neutron star]]s and [[Free electron model|free electron gases in metals]] (examples of [[degenerate matter]] and a [[Fermi gas]]), have a 3-dimensional [[Euclidean topology]]. Less familiar systems, like [[two-dimensional electron gas]]es (2DEG) in [[graphite]] layers and the [[quantum Hall effect]] system in [[MOSFET]] type devices, have a 2-dimensional Euclidean topology. Even less familiar are [[carbon nanotubes]], the [[quantum wire]] and [[Luttinger liquid]] with their 1-dimensional topologies. Systems with 1D and 2D topologies are likely to become more common, assuming developments in [[nanotechnology]] and [[materials science]] proceed.\n\n==Definition==\nIn general the density of states, related to volume ''V'' and ''N'' countable energy levels, is defined by:\n:<math> D(E) = \\frac{1}{V} \\cdot \\sum _{i=1}^N \\delta \\left(E - E\\left({\\vec{k}}_i\\right)\\right). </math>\n\nUsing <math> (\\Delta k)^d = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^d </math> (the smallest allowed change of <math>k</math> for a particle in a box of dimension <math>d</math> and length <math>L</math>) under the limit <math>L \\to \\infty</math>, one derives the volume-related density of states for continuous energy levels\n:<math> D(E) := \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d}{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^d k}{(2\\pi)^d}} \\cdot \\delta \\left(E - E\\left(\\vec{k}\\right)\\right),</math>\nwith <math>d</math> the spatial dimension of the considered system and <math>\\vec{k}</math> the wave vector.\n\nEquivalently, the density of states can also be understood as the derivative of the microcanonical partition function <math> Z_m (E)</math> (that is, the total number of states with energy less than <math>E</math>) with respect to the energy:\n:<math> D(E) = \\frac {1}{V} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d} Z_m (E)}{\\mathrm{d} E}</math>\n\nThe number of states with energy <math> E' </math> (degree of degeneracy) is given by:\n:<math> g\\left(E'\\right) = \\lim _{\\Delta E\\to 0} \\int _{E'}^{E' + \\Delta E} D(E) \\mathrm{d} E = \\lim _{\\Delta E\\to 0} D\\left(E'\\right) \\Delta E,</math>\nwhere the last equality only applies when the mean value theorem for integrals is valid.\n\n==Symmetry==\n[[File:Brillouin Zone (1st, FCC).svg|thumb|260px|First Brillouin zone of the [[Cubic crystal system|FCC lattice]], a [[truncated octahedron]], showing symmetry labels for high symmetry lines and points]]\nThere is a large variety of systems and types of states for which DOS calculations can be done.\n\nSome condensed matter systems possess a [[symmetry]] of its [[Crystal structure|structure]] on its microscopic scale which simplifies calculations of its density of states. In spherically symmetric systems, the integrals of function are one-dimensional because all variables in the calculation depend only on the radial parameter of the dispersion relation. [[Fluid]]s, [[glass]]es or [[amorphous solid]]s are example of a symmetric system whose [[dispersion relations]] has a rotational symmetry.\n\n[[File:Dual Cube-Octahedron.svg|thumb|150px|left|Octahedron.]]\nMeasurements on powders or polycrystalline samples require evaluation and calculation functions and integrals over the whole [[Domain of a function|domain]], most often a [[Brillouin zone]], of the dispersion relations of the system of interest. Sometimes the symmetry of the system is high, which causes the shape of the functions describing the dispersion relations of the system to appear many times over the whole domain of the dispersion relation. In such cases the effort to calculate the DOS can be reduced by a great amount when the calculation is limited to a reduced zone or [[fundamental domain]].<ref name=Harrison>\n{{cite book |author=Walter Ashley Harrison |title=Electronic Structure and the Properties of Solids |year= 1989 \n|publisher=Dover Publications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2VqQgAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-486-66021-9 }}\n</ref> The Brillouin zone of the [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic lattice]] (FCC) in the figure on the right has the 48-fold symmetry of the [[Point groups in three dimensions|point group]] ''O<sub>h</sub>'' with full [[Octahedral symmetry#Achiral octahedral symmetry|octahedral symmetry]]. This configuration means that the integration over the whole domain of the Brillouin zone can be reduced to a 48-th part of the whole Brillouin zone. As a [[Periodic table (crystal structure)|crystal structure periodic table]] shows, there are many elements with a FCC crystal structure, like [[diamond]], [[silicon]] and [[platinum]] and their Brillouin zones and dispersion relations have this 48-fold symmetry. Two other familiar crystal structures are the body-centered cubic lattice (BCC) and hexagonal closed packed structures (HCP) with cubic and hexagonal lattices, respectively. The BCC structure has the 24-fold [[Tetrahedral symmetry#Pyritohedral symmetry|pyritohedral symmetry]] of the point group ''T<sub>h</sub>''. The HCP structure has the 12-fold [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions#Examples|prismatic dihedral]] symmetry of the point group ''D<sub>3h</sub>''. A complete list of symmetry properties of a point group can be found in [[List of character tables for chemically important 3D point groups#Character tables|point group character tables]].\n\nIn general it is easier to calculate a DOS when the symmetry of the system is higher and the number of topological dimensions of the dispersion relation is lower. The DOS of dispersion relations with rotational symmetry can often be calculated analytically. This result is fortunate, since many materials of practical interest, such as steel and silicon, have high symmetry.\n\nIn [[anisotropic]] condensed matter systems such as a [[single crystal]] of a compound, the density of states could be different in one crystallographic direction than in another. These causes the anisotropic density of states to be more difficult to visualize, and might require methods such as calculating the DOS for particular points or directions only, or calculating the projected density of states (PDOS) to a particular crystal orientation.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==''k''-space topologies==\n\n[[File:K-space.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Figure 1: Spherical surface in ''k''-space for electrons in three dimensions.]]\n\nThe density of states is dependent upon the dimensional limits of the object itself. In a system described by three orthogonal parameters (3 Dimension), the units of DOS is Energy<sup>\u22121</sup>Volume<sup>\u22121</sup> , in a two dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy<sup>\u22121</sup>Area<sup>\u22121</sup> , in a one dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy<sup>\u22121</sup>Length<sup>\u22121</sup>. The referenced volume is the volume of ''k''-space; the space enclosed by the [[constant energy surface]] of the system derived through a [[dispersion relation]] that relates ''E'' to ''k''. An example of a 3-dimensional ''k''-space is given in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the dimensionality of the system confines the momentum of particles inside the system.\n\n===Density of wave vector states (sphere)===\nThe calculation for DOS starts by counting the ''N'' allowed states at a certain ''k'' that are contained within {{nowrap|[''k'',  ''k + dk'']}} inside the volume of the system. This procedure is done by differentiating the whole k-space volume <math>\\Omega_{n, k}</math> in n-dimensions at an arbitrary ''k'', with respect to ''k''. The volume, area or length in 3, 2 or 1-dimensional spherical ''k''-spaces are expressed by\n: <math>\\Omega_n(k) = c_n k^n</math>\n\nfor a n-dimensional ''k''-space with the topologically determined constants\n: <math>c_1 = 2,\\  c_2 = \\pi,\\  c_3 = \\frac{4 \\pi}{3}</math>\n\nfor linear, disk and spherical symmetrical shaped functions in 1, 2 and 3-dimensional Euclidean ''k''-spaces respectively.\n\nAccording to this scheme, the density of wave vector states ''N'' is, through differentiating <math>\\Omega_{n,k}</math> with respect to ''k'', expressed by\n:<math>N_n(k) = \\frac{{\\rm d}\\Omega_n(k)}{{\\rm d}k} = n\\; c_n\\; k^{n - 1}</math>\n\nThe 1, 2 and 3-dimensional density of wave vector states for a line, disk, or sphere are explicitly written as\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  N_1(k) &= 2 \\\\\n  N_2(k) &= 2 \\pi k \\\\\n  N_3(k) &= 4 \\pi k^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nOne state is large enough to contain particles having wavelength \u03bb. The wavelength is related to ''k'' through the relationship.\n: <math>k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}</math>\n\nIn a quantum system the length of \u03bb will depend on a characteristic spacing of the system L that is confining the particles. Finally the density of states ''N'' is multiplied by a factor ''<math>s/V_k</math>'', where ''s'' is a constant degeneracy factor that accounts for internal degrees of freedom due to such physical phenomena as spin or polarization. If no such phenomenon is present then <math>s = 1</math>. ''V<sub>k</sub>'' is the volume in k-space whose wavevectors are smaller than the smallest possible wavevectors decided by the characteristic spacing of the system.\n\n===Density of energy states===\nTo finish the calculation for DOS find the number of states per unit sample volume at an energy <math>E</math> inside an interval <math>[E, E+dE]</math>. The general form of DOS of a system is given as\n:<math>D_n\\left(E\\right) = \\frac{{\\rm d}\\Omega_n(E)}{{\\rm d}E}</math>\nThe scheme sketched so far ''only'' applies to ''monotonically rising'' and ''spherically symmetric'' dispersion relations. In general the dispersion relation <math>E(k)</math> is not spherically symmetric and in many cases it isn't continuously rising either. To express ''D'' as a function of ''E'' the [[Inverse function|inverse of the dispersion relation]] <math>E(k)</math> has to be substituted into the expression of <math>\\Omega_n(k)</math> as a function of ''k'' to get the expression of <math>\\Omega_n(E)</math> as a function of the energy. If the dispersion relation is not spherically symmetric or continuously rising and can't be inverted easily then in most cases the DOS has to be calculated numerically. More detailed derivations are available.<ref>[http://britneyspears.ac/physics/dos/dos.htm Sample density of states calculation]</ref><ref>[http://ece-www.colorado.edu/~bart/book/book/chapter2/ch2_4.htm Another density of states calculation]</ref>\n\n==Dispersion relations==\nThe dispersion relation for electrons in a solid is given by the [[electronic band structure]].\n \nThe [[kinetic energy]] of a particle depends on the magnitude and direction of the [[wave vector]] ''k'', the properties of the particle and the environment in which the particle is moving. For example, the kinetic energy of an [[electron]] in a [[Fermi gas]] is given by\n: <math>E = E_0 + \\frac{\\left(\\hbar k\\right)^2}{2m} \\ ,</math>\n\nwhere ''m'' is the [[Electron rest mass|electron mass]]. The dispersion relation is a spherically symmetric parabola and it is continuously rising so the DOS can be calculated easily.\n\n[[File:Monoatomic chain phonon dispersion.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2: Monatomic chain phonon dispersion relation]]\nFor longitudinal [[phonon]]s in a string of atoms the dispersion relation of the kinetic energy in a 1-dimensional ''k''-space, as shown in Figure 2, is given by\n:<math>E =  2 \\hbar \\omega_0 \\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right)\\right| </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{k_{\\rm F} / m}</math> is the oscillator frequency, <math>m</math> the mass of the atoms, <math>k_{\\rm F}</math> the inter-atomic force constant and <math>a</math> inter-atomic spacing.

The magnitude of the wave vector is related to the energy as:\n:<math>k = \\left(\\frac{E - E_0}{c_k}\\right)^\\frac{1}{p} \\ ,</math>\n\nAccordingly, the volume of n-dimensional ''k''-space containing wave vectors smaller than ''k'' is:\n:<math>\\Omega_n(k) = c_n k^n</math>\n\nSubstitution of the isotropic energy relation gives the volume of occupied states\n:<math>\\Omega_n(E) = \\frac{c_n}{{c_k}^\\frac{n}{p}}\\left(E - E_0\\right)^\\frac{n}{p}\\ ,</math>\n\nDifferentiating this volume with respect to the energy gives an expression for the DOS of the isotropic dispersion relation\n:<math>D_n\\left(E\\right) = \\frac {d}{dE}\\Omega_n(E) = \\frac{n c_n}{p {c_k}^\\frac{n}{p}} \\left(E - E_0\\right)^{\\frac{n}{p} - 1} </math>\n\n===Parabolic dispersion===\n[[File:Free-electron DOS.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 3: Free-electron DOS in 3-dimensional k-space]]\nIn the case of a parabolic dispersion relation (''p'' = 2), such as applies to free electrons in a Fermi gas, the resulting density of states, <math>D_n\\left(E\\right)</math>, for electrons in a n-dimensional systems is\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  D_1\\left(E\\right) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c_k \\left(E - E_0\\right)}} \\\\\n  D_2\\left(E\\right) &= \\frac{\\pi}{c_k} \\\\\n  D_3\\left(E\\right) &= 2 \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{E - E_0}{c_k^3}} \\ .\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nfor <math>E > E_0</math>, with <math>D(E) = 0</math> for <math>E < E_0</math>.\n\nIn 1-dimensional systems the DOS diverges at the bottom of the band as <math>E</math> drops to <math>E_0</math>.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In 2-dimensional systems the DOS turns out to be independent of <math>E</math>.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Finally for 3-dimensional systems the DOS rises as the square root of the energy.<ref name=Kittel>{{cite book |title=Introduction to Solid State Physics |author=Charles Kittel |page=Equation (37), p. 216 |edition=7th |publisher=Wiley |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-471-11181-8 |nopp=true}}</ref>\n\nIncluding the prefactor ''<math>s/V_k</math>'', the expression for the 3D DOS is\n:<math>N(E) = \\frac {V}{2\\pi^2} \\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{E - E_0}</math>,\n\nwhere <math>V</math> is the total volume, and <math>N(E-E_0)</math> includes the 2-fold spin degeneracy.\n\n===Linear dispersion===\nIn the case of a linear relation (''p'' = 1), such as applies to [[photon]]s, [[acoustic phonon]]s, or to some special kinds of electronic bands in a solid, the DOS in 1, 2 and 3 dimensional systems is related to the energy as:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  D_1\\left(E\\right) &= \\frac{1}{c_k} \\\\\n  D_2\\left(E\\right) &= \\frac{2 \\pi}{c_k^2}\\left(E - E_0\\right) \\\\\n  D_3\\left(E\\right) &= \\frac{4 \\pi}{c_k^3}\\left(E - E_0\\right)^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Distribution functions==\n{{main|Kinetic theory of solids}}\nThe density of states plays an important role in the [[kinetic theory of solids]]. The product of the density of states and the [[Distribution function (physics)|probability distribution function]] is the number of occupied states per unit volume at a given energy for a system in thermal equilibrium. This value is widely used to investigate various physical properties of matter. The following are examples, using two common distribution functions, of how applying a distribution function to the density of states can give rise to physical properties.\n\n[[File:Fermi-Dirac product with Density of States.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 4: The {{colorbox|#5e81B5}}{{nbsp}}Fermi-Dirac probability distribution, {{colorbox|#e19c24}}{{nbsp}}density of states, and {{colorbox|#8FB131}}{{nbsp}}their product for a semiconductor.

[[Fermion]]s are particles which obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] (e.g. electrons, protons, neutrons). The distribution function can be written as\n: <math>f_{\\mathrm{FD}}(E) = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E - \\mu}{k_\\mathrm{B} T}\\right) + 1}</math>\n\n<math>\\mu</math> is the [[chemical potential]] (also denoted as E<sub>F</sub> and called the [[Fermi level]] when ''T''=0), <math>k_\\mathrm{B}</math> is the Boltzmann constant, and <math>T</math> is temperature. Fig. 4 illustrates how the product of the Fermi-Dirac distribution function and the three-dimensional density of states for a semiconductor can give insight to physical properties such as carrier concentration and Energy band gaps.\n\n[[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]]: The Bose\u2013Einstein probability distribution function is used to find the probability that a boson occupies a specific quantum state in a system at thermal equilibrium. [[Boson]]s are particles which do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (e.g. phonons and photons). The distribution function can be written as\n:<math>f_{\\mathrm{BE}}(E) = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E - \\mu}{k_{\\rm B} T}\\right) - 1}</math>\n\nFrom these two distributions it is possible to calculate properties such as the [[internal energy]] <math>U</math>, the number of particles <math>N</math>, [[specific heat capacity]] <math>C</math>, and [[thermal conductivity]] <math>k</math>. The relationships between these properties and the product of the density of states and the probability distribution, denoting the density of states by <math>g(E)</math> instead of <math>D(E)</math>, are given by\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  U &= \\int E\\, f(E)\\, g(E)\\,{\\rm d}E \\\\\n  N &= \\int f(E)\\, g(E)\\,{\\rm d}E \\\\\n  C &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\int E\\, f(E)\\, g(E) \\,{\\rm d}E \\\\\n  k &= \\frac{1}{d}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\int E f(E)\\, g(E)\\, \\nu(E)\\, \\Lambda(E)\\,{\\rm d}E\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n<math>d</math> is dimensionality, <math>\\nu</math> is sound velocity and <math>\\Lambda</math> is [[mean free path]].\n\n==Applications==\nThe density of states appears in many areas of physics, and helps to explain a number of quantum mechanical phenomena.\n\n===Quantization===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DOS multdim.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 3: Density of states for electrons in bulk semiconductors (3D; in blue), quantum wells (2D; red), quantum wires (1D; green) and quantum dots (0D; black).]] -->\nCalculating the density of states for small structures shows that the distribution of electrons changes as dimensionality is reduced.

Some structures can completely inhibit the propagation of light of certain colors (energies), creating a photonic band gap: the DOS is zero for those photon energies. Other structures can inhibit the propagation of light only in certain directions to create mirrors, waveguides, and cavities. Such periodic structures are known as [[photonic crystals]].<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| title = Inhibited Spontaneous Emission in Solid-State Physics and Electronics\n| author1 =Yablonovitch, E.\n| journal = Phys.

For example, the figure on the right illustrates LDOS of a [[transistor]] as it turns on and off in a ballistic simulation. The LDOS has clear boundary in the source and drain, that corresponds to the location of band edge.

It is mathematically represented as a distribution by a [[probability density function]], and it is generally an average over the space and time domains of the various states occupied by the system. The density of states is directly related to the [[dispersion relation]]s of the properties of the system. High DOS at a specific energy level means that many states are available for occupation.\n\nGenerally, the density of states of matter is continuous. In [[isolated system]]s however, such as atoms or molecules in the gas phase, the density distribution is [[Discrete distribution|discrete]], like a [[spectral density]]. Local variations, most often due to distortions of the original system, are often called '''local density of states''' (LDOS).\n\n==Introduction==\nIn quantum mechanical systems, waves, or wave-like particles, can occupy modes or states with wavelengths and propagation directions dictated by the system. For example, in some systems, the interatomic spacing and the atomic charge of a material could allow only electrons of certain wavelengths to exist. In other systems, the crystalline structure of a material could allow waves to propagate in one direction, while suppressing wave propagation in another direction. Often, only specific states are permitted. Thus, it can happen that many states are available for occupation at a specific energy level, while no states are available at other energy levels .\n\nFor example, the density of states of electrons at the band edge between the [[valence and conduction bands]] in a semiconductor is shown in orange in Fig. 4. For an electron in the conduction band, an increase of the electron energy makes more states available for occupation. Alternatively, the density of state is discontinuous for an interval of energy, which means that no states are available for electrons to occupy within the band gap of the material. This condition also means that an electron at the conduction band edge must lose at least the band gap energy of the material in order to transition to another state in the valence band.\n\nDepending on the quantum mechanical system, the density of states can be calculated for [[electron]]s, [[photon]]s, or [[phonon]]s, and can be given as a function of either energy or the [[wave vector]] ''k''. To convert between the DOS as a function of the energy and the DOS as a function of the wave vector, the system-specific energy dispersion relation between ''E'' and ''k'' must be known.\n\nIn general, the topological properties of the system have a major impact on the properties of the density of states. The most well-known systems, like [[neutronium]] in [[neutron star]]s and [[Free electron model|free electron gases in metals]] (examples of [[degenerate matter]] and a [[Fermi gas]]), have a 3-dimensional [[Euclidean topology]]. Less familiar systems, like [[two-dimensional electron gas]]es (2DEG) in [[graphite]] layers and the [[quantum Hall effect]] system in [[MOSFET]] type devices, have a 2-dimensional Euclidean topology. Even less familiar are [[carbon nanotubes]], the [[quantum wire]] and [[Luttinger liquid]] with their 1-dimensional topologies. Systems with 1D and 2D topologies are likely to become more common, assuming developments in [[nanotechnology]] and [[materials science]] proceed.\n\n==Definition==\nIn general the density of states, related to volume ''V'' and ''N'' countable energy levels, is defined by:\n:<math> D(E) = \\frac{1}{V} \\cdot \\sum _{i=1}^N \\delta \\left(E - E\\left({\\vec{k}}_i\\right)\\right). </math>\n\nUsing <math> (\\Delta k)^d = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^d </math> (the smallest allowed change of <math>k</math> for a particle in a box of dimension <math>d</math> and length <math>L</math>) under the limit <math>L \\to \\infty</math>, one derives the volume-related density of states for continuous energy levels\n:<math> D(E) := \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d}{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^d k}{(2\\pi)^d}} \\cdot \\delta \\left(E - E\\left(\\vec{k}\\right)\\right),</math>\nwith <math>d</math> the spatial dimension of the considered system and <math>\\vec{k}</math> the wave vector.\n\nEquivalently, the density of states can also be understood as the derivative of the microcanonical partition function <math> Z_m (E)</math> (that is, the total number of states with energy less than <math>E</math>) with respect to the energy:\n:<math> D(E) = \\frac {1}{V} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d} Z_m (E)}{\\mathrm{d} E}</math>\n\nThe number of states with energy <math> E' </math> (degree of degeneracy) is given by:\n:<math> g\\left(E'\\right) = \\lim _{\\Delta E\\to 0} \\int _{E'}^{E' + \\Delta E} D(E) \\mathrm{d} E = \\lim _{\\Delta E\\to 0} D\\left(E'\\right) \\Delta E,</math>\nwhere the last equality only applies when the mean value theorem for integrals is valid.\n\n==Symmetry==\n[[File:Brillouin Zone (1st, FCC).svg|thumb|260px|First Brillouin zone of the [[Cubic crystal system|FCC lattice]], a [[truncated octahedron]], showing symmetry labels for high symmetry lines and points]]\nThere is a large variety of systems and types of states for which DOS calculations can be done.\n\nSome condensed matter systems possess a [[symmetry]] of its [[Crystal structure|structure]] on its microscopic scale which simplifies calculations of its density of states. In spherically symmetric systems, the integrals of function are one-dimensional because all variables in the calculation depend only on the radial parameter of the dispersion relation. [[Fluid]]s, [[glass]]es or [[amorphous solid]]s are example of a symmetric system whose [[dispersion relations]] has a rotational symmetry.\n\n[[File:Dual Cube-Octahedron.svg|thumb|150px|left|Octahedron.]]\nMeasurements on powders or polycrystalline samples require evaluation and calculation functions and integrals over the whole [[Domain of a function|domain]], most often a [[Brillouin zone]], of the dispersion relations of the system of interest. Sometimes the symmetry of the system is high, which causes the shape of the functions describing the dispersion relations of the system to appear many times over the whole domain of the dispersion relation. In such cases the effort to calculate the DOS can be reduced by a great amount when the calculation is limited to a reduced zone or [[fundamental domain]].<ref name=Harrison>\n{{cite book |author=Walter Ashley Harrison |title=Electronic Structure and the Properties of Solids |year= 1989 \n|publisher=Dover Publications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2VqQgAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-486-66021-9 }}\n</ref> The Brillouin zone of the [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic lattice]] (FCC) in the figure on the right has the 48-fold symmetry of the [[Point groups in three dimensions|point group]] ''O<sub>h</sub>'' with full [[Octahedral symmetry#Achiral octahedral symmetry|octahedral symmetry]]. This configuration means that the integration over the whole domain of the Brillouin zone can be reduced to a 48-th part of the whole Brillouin zone. As a [[Periodic table (crystal structure)|crystal structure periodic table]] shows, there are many elements with a FCC crystal structure, like [[diamond]], [[silicon]] and [[platinum]] and their Brillouin zones and dispersion relations have this 48-fold symmetry. Two other familiar crystal structures are the body-centered cubic lattice (BCC) and hexagonal closed packed structures (HCP) with cubic and hexagonal lattices, respectively. The BCC structure has the 24-fold [[Tetrahedral symmetry#Pyritohedral symmetry|pyritohedral symmetry]] of the point group ''T<sub>h</sub>''. The HCP structure has the 12-fold [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions#Examples|prismatic dihedral]] symmetry of the point group ''D<sub>3h</sub>''. A complete list of symmetry properties of a point group can be found in [[List of character tables for chemically important 3D point groups#Character tables|point group character tables]].\n\nIn general it is easier to calculate a DOS when the symmetry of the system is higher and the number of topological dimensions of the dispersion relation is lower. The DOS of dispersion relations with rotational symmetry can often be calculated analytically. This result is fortunate, since many materials of practical interest, such as steel and silicon, have high symmetry.\n\nIn [[anisotropic]] condensed matter systems such as a [[single crystal]] of a compound, the density of states could be different in one crystallographic direction than in another. These causes the anisotropic density of states to be more difficult to visualize, and might require methods such as calculating the DOS for particular points or directions only, or calculating the projected density of states (PDOS) to a particular crystal orientation.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==''k''-space topologies==\n\n[[File:K-space.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Figure 1: Spherical surface in ''k''-space for electrons in three dimensions.]]\n\nThe density of states is dependent upon the dimensional limits of the object itself. In a system described by three orthogonal parameters (3 Dimension), the units of DOS is Energy<sup>\u22121</sup>Volume<sup>\u22121</sup> , in a two dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy<sup>\u22121</sup>Area<sup>\u22121</sup> , in a one dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy<sup>\u22121</sup>Length<sup>\u22121</sup>. The referenced volume is the volume of ''k''-space; the space enclosed by the [[constant energy surface]] of the system derived through a [[dispersion relation]] that relates ''E'' to ''k''. An example of a 3-dimensional ''k''-space is given in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the dimensionality of the system confines the momentum of particles inside the system.\n\n===Density of wave vector states (sphere)===\nThe calculation for DOS starts by counting the ''N'' allowed states at a certain ''k'' that are contained within {{nowrap|[''k'',  ''k + dk'']}} inside the volume of the system. This procedure is done by differentiating the whole k-space volume <math>\\Omega_{n, k}</math> in n-dimensions at an arbitrary ''k'', with respect to ''k''. The volume, area or length in 3, 2 or 1-dimensional spherical ''k''-spaces are expressed by\n: <math>\\Omega_n(k) = c_n k^n</math>\n\nfor a n-dimensional ''k''-space with the topologically determined constants\n: <math>c_1 = 2,\\  c_2 = \\pi,\\  c_3 = \\frac{4 \\pi}{3}</math>\n\nfor linear, disk and spherical symmetrical shaped functions in 1, 2 and 3-dimensional Euclidean ''k''-spaces respectively.\n\nAccording to this scheme, the density of wave vector states ''N'' is, through differentiating <math>\\Omega_{n,k}</math> with respect to ''k'', expressed by\n:<math>N_n(k) = \\frac{{\\rm d}\\Omega_n(k)}{{\\rm d}k} = n\\; c_n\\; k^{n - 1}</math>\n\nThe 1, 2 and 3-dimensional density of wave vector states for a line, disk, or sphere are explicitly written as\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  N_1(k) &= 2 \\\\\n  N_2(k) &= 2 \\pi k \\\\\n  N_3(k) &= 4 \\pi k^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nOne state is large enough to contain particles having wavelength \u03bb. The wavelength is related to ''k'' through the relationship.\n: <math>k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}</math>\n\nIn a quantum system the length of \u03bb will depend on a characteristic spacing of the system L that is confining the particles. Finally the density of states ''N'' is multiplied by a factor ''<math>s/V_k</math>'', where ''s'' is a constant degeneracy factor that accounts for internal degrees of freedom due to such physical phenomena as spin or polarization. If no such phenomenon is present then <math>s = 1</math>. ''V<sub>k</sub>'' is the volume in k-space whose wavevectors are smaller than the smallest possible wavevectors decided by the characteristic spacing of the system.\n\n===Density of energy states===\nTo finish the calculation for DOS find the number of states per unit sample volume at an energy <math>E</math> inside an interval <math>[E, E+dE]</math>. The general form of DOS of a system is given as\n:<math>D_n\\left(E\\right) = \\frac{{\\rm d}\\Omega_n(E)}{{\\rm d}E}</math>\nThe scheme sketched so far ''only'' applies to ''monotonically rising'' and ''spherically symmetric'' dispersion relations. In general the dispersion relation <math>E(k)</math> is not spherically symmetric and in many cases it isn't continuously rising either. To express ''D'' as a function of ''E'' the [[Inverse function|inverse of the dispersion relation]] <math>E(k)</math> has to be substituted into the expression of <math>\\Omega_n(k)</math> as a function of ''k'' to get the expression of <math>\\Omega_n(E)</math> as a function of the energy. If the dispersion relation is not spherically symmetric or continuously rising and can't be inverted easily then in most cases the DOS has to be calculated numerically. More detailed derivations are available.<ref>[http://britneyspears.ac/physics/dos/dos.htm Sample density of states calculation]</ref><ref>[http://ece-www.colorado.edu/~bart/book/book/chapter2/ch2_4.htm Another density of states calculation]</ref>\n\n==Dispersion relations==\nThe dispersion relation for electrons in a solid is given by the [[electronic band structure]].\n \nThe [[kinetic energy]] of a particle depends on the magnitude and direction of the [[wave vector]] ''k'', the properties of the particle and the environment in which the particle is moving. For example, the kinetic energy of an [[electron]] in a [[Fermi gas]] is given by\n: <math>E = E_0 + \\frac{\\left(\\hbar k\\right)^2}{2m} \\ ,</math>\n\nwhere ''m'' is the [[Electron rest mass|electron mass]]. The dispersion relation is a spherically symmetric parabola and it is continuously rising so the DOS can be calculated easily.\n\n[[File:Monoatomic chain phonon dispersion.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2: Monatomic chain phonon dispersion relation]]\nFor longitudinal [[phonon]]s in a string of atoms the dispersion relation of the kinetic energy in a 1-dimensional ''k''-space, as shown in Figure 2, is given by\n:<math>E =  2 \\hbar \\omega_0 \\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right)\\right| </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{k_{\\rm F} / m}</math> is the oscillator frequency, <math>m</math> the mass of the atoms, <math>k_{\\rm F}</math> the inter-atomic force constant and <math>a</math> inter-atomic spacing. For small values of <math>k \\ll \\pi / a </math> the dispersion relation is rather linear:\n:<math>E = \\hbar \\omega_0 ka </math>\n\nWhen <math>k \\approx \\pi / a </math> the energy is\n:<math>E = 2 \\hbar \\omega_0 \\left|\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi - ka}{2}\\right)\\right|</math>\n\nWith the transformation <math>q = k - \\pi/a </math> and small <math>q</math> this relation can be transformed to \n:<math>E = 2 \\hbar \\omega_0 \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{qa}{2}\\right)^2\\right] </math>\n\n===Isotropic dispersion relations===\nThe two examples mentioned here can be expressed like\n:<math>E = E_0 + c_k k^p</math>\n\nThis expression is a kind of [[dispersion relation]] because it interrelates two wave properties and it is [[isotropy|isotropic]] because only the length and not the direction of the wave vector appears in the expression. The magnitude of the wave vector is related to the energy as:\n:<math>k = \\left(\\frac{E - E_0}{c_k}\\right)^\\frac{1}{p} \\ ,</math>\n\nAccordingly, the volume of n-dimensional ''k''-space containing wave vectors smaller than ''k'' is:\n:<math>\\Omega_n(k) = c_n k^n</math>\n\nSubstitution of the isotropic energy relation gives the volume of occupied states\n:<math>\\Omega_n(E) = \\frac{c_n}{{c_k}^\\frac{n}{p}}\\left(E - E_0\\right)^\\frac{n}{p}\\ ,</math>\n\nDifferentiating this volume with respect to the energy gives an expression for the DOS of the isotropic dispersion relation\n:<math>D_n\\left(E\\right) = \\frac {d}{dE}\\Omega_n(E) = \\frac{n c_n}{p {c_k}^\\frac{n}{p}} \\left(E - E_0\\right)^{\\frac{n}{p} - 1} </math>\n\n===Parabolic dispersion===\n[[File:Free-electron DOS.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 3: Free-electron DOS in 3-dimensional k-space]]\nIn the case of a parabolic dispersion relation (''p'' = 2), such as applies to free electrons in a Fermi gas, the resulting density of states, <math>D_n\\left(E\\right)</math>, for electrons in a n-dimensional systems is\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  D_1\\left(E\\right) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c_k \\left(E - E_0\\right)}} \\\\\n  D_2\\left(E\\right) &= \\frac{\\pi}{c_k} \\\\\n  D_3\\left(E\\right) &= 2 \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{E - E_0}{c_k^3}} \\ .\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nfor <math>E > E_0</math>, with <math>D(E) = 0</math> for <math>E < E_0</math>.\n\nIn 1-dimensional systems the DOS diverges at the bottom of the band as <math>E</math> drops to <math>E_0</math>.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In 2-dimensional systems the DOS turns out to be independent of <math>E</math>.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Finally for 3-dimensional systems the DOS rises as the square root of the energy.<ref name=Kittel>{{cite book |title=Introduction to Solid State Physics |author=Charles Kittel |page=Equation (37), p. 216 |edition=7th |publisher=Wiley |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-471-11181-8 |nopp=true}}</ref>\n\nIncluding the prefactor ''<math>s/V_k</math>'', the expression for the 3D DOS is\n:<math>N(E) = \\frac {V}{2\\pi^2} \\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{E - E_0}</math>,\n\nwhere <math>V</math> is the total volume, and <math>N(E-E_0)</math> includes the 2-fold spin degeneracy.\n\n===Linear dispersion===\nIn the case of a linear relation (''p'' = 1), such as applies to [[photon]]s, [[acoustic phonon]]s, or to some special kinds of electronic bands in a solid, the DOS in 1, 2 and 3 dimensional systems is related to the energy as:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  D_1\\left(E\\right) &= \\frac{1}{c_k} \\\\\n  D_2\\left(E\\right) &= \\frac{2 \\pi}{c_k^2}\\left(E - E_0\\right) \\\\\n  D_3\\left(E\\right) &= \\frac{4 \\pi}{c_k^3}\\left(E - E_0\\right)^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Distribution functions==\n{{main|Kinetic theory of solids}}\nThe density of states plays an important role in the [[kinetic theory of solids]]. The product of the density of states and the [[Distribution function (physics)|probability distribution function]] is the number of occupied states per unit volume at a given energy for a system in thermal equilibrium. This value is widely used to investigate various physical properties of matter. The following are examples, using two common distribution functions, of how applying a distribution function to the density of states can give rise to physical properties.\n\n[[File:Fermi-Dirac product with Density of States.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 4: The {{colorbox|#5e81B5}}{{nbsp}}Fermi-Dirac probability distribution, {{colorbox|#e19c24}}{{nbsp}}density of states, and {{colorbox|#8FB131}}{{nbsp}}their product for a semiconductor. The lower green lobe depicts ''hole'' energy, and thus uses <math>f(-x)</math> as the distribution function.]]\n\n[[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]]: The Fermi\u2013Dirac probability distribution function, Fig. 4, is used to find the probability that a fermion occupies a specific quantum state in a system at thermal equilibrium. [[Fermion]]s are particles which obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] (e.g. electrons, protons, neutrons). The distribution function can be written as\n: <math>f_{\\mathrm{FD}}(E) = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E - \\mu}{k_\\mathrm{B} T}\\right) + 1}</math>\n\n<math>\\mu</math> is the [[chemical potential]] (also denoted as E<sub>F</sub> and called the [[Fermi level]] when ''T''=0), <math>k_\\mathrm{B}</math> is the Boltzmann constant, and <math>T</math> is temperature. Fig. 4 illustrates how the product of the Fermi-Dirac distribution function and the three-dimensional density of states for a semiconductor can give insight to physical properties such as carrier concentration and Energy band gaps.\n\n[[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]]: The Bose\u2013Einstein probability distribution function is used to find the probability that a boson occupies a specific quantum state in a system at thermal equilibrium. [[Boson]]s are particles which do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (e.g. phonons and photons). The distribution function can be written as\n:<math>f_{\\mathrm{BE}}(E) = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E - \\mu}{k_{\\rm B} T}\\right) - 1}</math>\n\nFrom these two distributions it is possible to calculate properties such as the [[internal energy]] <math>U</math>, the number of particles <math>N</math>, [[specific heat capacity]] <math>C</math>, and [[thermal conductivity]] <math>k</math>. The relationships between these properties and the product of the density of states and the probability distribution, denoting the density of states by <math>g(E)</math> instead of <math>D(E)</math>, are given by\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  U &= \\int E\\, f(E)\\, g(E)\\,{\\rm d}E \\\\\n  N &= \\int f(E)\\, g(E)\\,{\\rm d}E \\\\\n  C &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\int E\\, f(E)\\, g(E) \\,{\\rm d}E \\\\\n  k &= \\frac{1}{d}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\int E f(E)\\, g(E)\\, \\nu(E)\\, \\Lambda(E)\\,{\\rm d}E\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n<math>d</math> is dimensionality, <math>\\nu</math> is sound velocity and <math>\\Lambda</math> is [[mean free path]].\n\n==Applications==\nThe density of states appears in many areas of physics, and helps to explain a number of quantum mechanical phenomena.\n\n===Quantization===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DOS multdim.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 3: Density of states for electrons in bulk semiconductors (3D; in blue), quantum wells (2D; red), quantum wires (1D; green) and quantum dots (0D; black).]] -->\nCalculating the density of states for small structures shows that the distribution of electrons changes as dimensionality is reduced. For [[quantum wires]], the DOS for certain energies actually becomes higher than the DOS for bulk semiconductors, and for [[quantum dots]] the electrons become quantized to certain energies.\n\n===Photonic crystals===\nThe photon density of states can be manipulated by using periodic structures with length scales on the order of the wavelength of light. Some structures can completely inhibit the propagation of light of certain colors (energies), creating a photonic band gap: the DOS is zero for those photon energies. Other structures can inhibit the propagation of light only in certain directions to create mirrors, waveguides, and cavities. Such periodic structures are known as [[photonic crystals]].<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| title = Inhibited Spontaneous Emission in Solid-State Physics and Electronics\n| author1 =Yablonovitch, E.\n| journal = Phys.

One proceeds as follows: the cost function (for example the energy) of the system is discretized. Each time the bin ''i'' is reached one updates\na histogram for the density of states, <math>g(i)</math>, by\n\n:<math> g(i) \\rightarrow  g(i) + f</math>\n\nwhere ''f'' is called the modification factor. As soon as each bin in the histogram is visited a certain number of times\n(10-15), the modification factor is reduced by some criterion, for instance,\n\n:<math> f_{n+1} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2} f_{n}</math>\n\nwhere ''n'' denotes the ''n''-th update step. The simulation finishes when the modification factor is less than a certain threshold, for instance <math>f_n < 10^{-8} </math>.\n\nThe Wang and Landau algorithm has some advantages over other common algorithms such as [[multicanonical ensemble|multicanonical simulations]] and [[parallel tempering]]. For example, the density of states is obtained as the main product of the simulation. Additionally, Wang and Landau simulations are completely independent of the temperature. This feature allows to compute the density of states of systems with very rough energy landscape such as proteins.<ref name=\"ojeda\">{{cite journal |author1=Ojeda, P. |author2=Garcia, M. |title=Electric Field-Driven Disruption of a Native beta-Sheet Protein Conformation and Generation of a Helix-Structure  |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=595\u2013599 |year=2010 |doi= 10.1016/j.bpj.2010.04.040 |pmid=20643079|bibcode = 2010BpJ....99..595O |pmc=2905109}}</ref>\n\nMathematically the density of states is formulated in terms of a tower of covering maps.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| title = Density of states in spectral geometry of states in spectral geometry\n| author = Adachi T. and [[Toshikazu Sunada|Sunada.

In materials science, for example, this term is useful when interpreting the data from a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM), since this method is capable of imaging electron densities of states with atomic resolution. According to crystal structure, this quantity can be predicted by computational methods, as for example with [[density functional theory]].\n\n[[File:Omen ldos v3.gif|thumb|300px|right|Space resolved local density of states. A sequence of images with varying gate bias in a nanowire MOSFET at drain bias Vd=0.6V. Notice the confined energy levels as they move with increasing gate bias.]]\n\n===Solid state devices===\nLDOS can be used to gain profit into a solid-state device. For example, the figure on the right illustrates LDOS of a [[transistor]] as it turns on and off in a ballistic simulation. The LDOS has clear boundary in the source and drain, that corresponds to the location of band edge. In the channel, the DOS is increasing as gate voltage increase and potential barrier goes down.\n\n===Optics and Photonics===\nIn optics and photonics, the concept of local density of states refers to the states that can be occupied by a photon. For light it is usually measured by fluorescence methods, near-field scanning methods or by cathodoluminescence techniques. For different photonic structures, the LDOS have different behaviors and they are controlling spontaneous emission in different ways. In photonic crystals, the near-zero LDOS are expected and they cause inhibition in the spontaneous emission.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| title = Density of states in spectral geometry of states in spectral geometry\n| author1 = Sprik, R.| author2 = van Tiggelen, B.
